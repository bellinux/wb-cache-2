5|$|The Harrier II {{retains the}} {{tandem landing gear}} layout of the first-generation Harriers, {{although}} each outrigger landing gear leg was moved from the wingtip to mid-span for a tighter turning radius when taxiing. The engine intakes are larger {{than those of the}} first-generation Harrier, and have a revised inlet. On the underside of the fuselage, McDonnell Douglas added lift-improvement devices, which capture the reflected <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust</b> when close to the ground, giving the equivalent of up to 1,200lb (544kg) of extra lift.|$|E
5|$|The tests {{revealed}} {{a number of}} problems in that the thick wing inherited from the Yak-3 limited the top speed of the aircraft, the <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust</b> damaged the surface of the airfield, the cockpit often filled with smoke from kerosene and oil that had dripped onto the engine, and the aircraft was very short-ranged. Despite these problems, the Yak-15 proved to be very easy to fly, even for pilots accustomed to piston-engined fighters, and caused the VVS to accept the fighter as a conversion trainer.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{small power}} station {{comprising}} three Cummins B and C series diesel engines, offering an approx 150 kVa 3 phase supply {{to most of the}} island buildings. Waste heat from the engine jackets is used for a district heating pipe. There are also plans to collect the waste heat from the <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust</b> heat gases to feed into the district heat network to improve the efficiency further. The Power is normally switched off between 0000 and 0630.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the three}} {{prototype}}s began in late 1945 and the first prototype began manufacturer's testing on 30 December. The ground testing revealed that the <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust</b> caused a low-pressure area under the rear fuselage which caused the fighter to tilt tail-down during engine tests. The rigidly mounted heatshield caused {{the underside of the}} rear fuselage to deform because the steel and the duralumin skin of the fuselage had different expansion ratios when heated. The rear fuselage and the heatshield were both redesigned to eliminate these problems. On 23 March the prototype was trucked to the Flight Research Institute (LII)'s airfield at Ramenskoye to begin preparations for flight testing.|$|E
5|$|HB1002 {{was lost}} on 11July1979 during the aircraft's 52nd flight. A {{hydraulic}} leak caused an engine fire, {{resulting in the}} loss of hydraulic pressure, which in turn caused severe pitch oscillations. The pilot ejected safely, and the aircraft was destroyed. It was later discovered that an <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust</b> clamp had loosened, allowing the hot exhaust to migrate to the right engine compartment. The heat built up there, causing the hydraulic lines to fail. The debris from both aircraft was secretly buried somewhere within the Nellis complex. Despite the crashes, Have Blue was considered a success.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} opinion {{presented by the}} NTSB accident report determined {{that the cause of}} the accident was the TWA flight crew's inability to successfully abort takeoff procedures due to an excess of speed. The NTSB recommended revisions and expansions to airline abort procedures and new FAA regulations defining runway clearance and procedures, taking into account jet <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust.</b> In his minority report, Mr. McAdams' said that he would have found the probable cause of the accident to be the Delta crew's failure to adequately advise the tower of the proximity to the runway, and the tower's failure to request additional and precise information prior to clearing TWA 159 for takeoff.|$|E
50|$|In {{internal}} combustion <b>engines,</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas recirculation (EGR) is a nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions reduction technique used in petrol/gasoline and diesel engines. EGR works by recirculating {{a portion of}} an <b>engine's</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas back to the engine cylinders. This dilutes the O2 in the incoming air stream and provides gases inert to combustion to act as absorbents of combustion heat to reduce peak in-cylinder temperatures. NOx is produced in a narrow band of high cylinder temperatures and pressures.|$|R

5|$|The {{victims were}} gassed with diesel exhaust {{from the engine}} of a Red Army tank. SS-Scharführer Erich Fuchs was {{responsible}} for installing it. The engine was brought in by the SS {{at the time of}} the camp's construction and housed in a room with a generator that supplied the camp with electricity. The tank <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust</b> pipe ran just below the ground and opened into all three gas chambers. The fumes could be seen seeping out. After about 20 minutes the bodies were removed by dozens of Sonderkommandos, placed onto carts and wheeled away. The system was imperfect and required a lot of effort; trains that arrived later in the day had to wait on layover tracks overnight at Treblinka, Małkinia, or Wólka Okrąglik.|$|E
5|$|Pure carbon has {{extremely}} low toxicity to humans {{and can be}} handled and even ingested safely {{in the form of}} graphite or charcoal. It is resistant to dissolution or chemical attack, even in the acidic contents of the digestive tract. Consequently, once it enters into the body's tissues it is likely to remain there indefinitely. Carbon black {{was probably one of the}} first pigments to be used for tattooing, and Ötzi the Iceman was found to have carbon tattoos that survived during his life and for 5200years after his death. Inhalation of coal dust or soot (carbon black) in large quantities can be dangerous, irritating lung tissues and causing the congestive lung disease, coalworker's pneumoconiosis. Diamond dust used as an abrasive can be harmful if ingested or inhaled. Microparticles of carbon are produced in diesel <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust</b> fumes, and may accumulate in the lungs. In these examples, the harm may result from contaminants (e.g., organic chemicals, heavy metals) rather than from the carbon itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{order for}} 50 {{aircraft}} placed in 1946 was modified to 48 single seaters and one aircraft for the OKB itself, all lacking armament. They were manufactured in March–April 1947 {{with the standard}} armament of one 37mm Nudelman N-37 autocannon, with 40 rounds, and two 23mm Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 guns, but the production line shut down afterward to incorporate some of the desired changes. These included reinforcement and enlargement of the vertical tail to improve lateral stability; air brakes were added on the wings and the fuel system was improved. The underside of the rear fuselage was recontoured to smooth the air flow of the <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust</b> and air suction inside the fuselage was eliminated. Production restarted {{and a total of}} 243 single seaters were completed during the remainder of the year. 250 fighters and 60 trainers were scheduled to be built in 1948, but production was disrupted by preparations to begin manufacture of the vastly superior MiG-15 later that year. Only 302 fighters were delivered that year before production ceased.|$|E

5|$|Having, in his view, perfected many of {{his ideas}} and designs for steam engines, Evans turned his {{attention}} once more to the commercial propagation of his inventions. His first steam engines had been constructed on an ad-hoc basis, often with improvised tools and workers, and he had relied heavily on blacksmiths and other metal-working shops in Philadelphia with little experience in the more precise metal-work required to build steam engines. In particular, Evans soon realized that unlike his milling machines of wood and leather he would need specialist skills, precision tools and a large foundry {{in order to build}} steam machines on a commercial basis. Thus, Evans constructed the Mars Works on a large site a few blocks north of his store in Philadelphia. The choice of name, after the Roman god of war, is thought to have been aspirational and a challenge to the Soho Foundry near Birmingham in the United Kingdom, famous for building the Watt and Boulton engines. Indeed, the completed Mars Works was {{one of the largest and}} best equipped outfits of its kind in the United States—by contemporary accounts it featured a substantial foundry, moldmaker's shop, blacksmith's shops, millstone maker, a steam engine works and a large steam engine of its own to grind materials and work wrought iron. With over thirty-five staff, the Mars Works produced a wide range of manufactures ranging from working steam engines to cast iron fittings, as well as milling and farming machines for Evans's now well-established agricultural clientele. Steam engine orders alone proved insufficient to support the extensive business costs; hence the works became highly experienced in producing all kinds of heavy machinery, contributing to Philadelphia's emergence as a leading center for such work in the 19th century. Indeed, the works even received military orders, casting naval cannons during the War of 1812. Evans also proved highly innovative in designing steam power solutions for his clients. In one example where the Mars Works was commissioned to build engines for wool processing factories in Middletown, Connecticut, Evans designed a network of accompanying pipes with radiators to heat the factory with <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust.</b>|$|E
25|$|Thrust {{vectoring}} is {{a technique}} used for jet and rocket engines, where {{the direction of the}} <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust</b> is varied. In VTOL, the exhaust can be varied between vertical and horizontal thrust.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fully}} open cruise position, {{together}} with engine nozzle, they formed an ejector nozzle {{to control the}} expansion of the exhaust. The eyelids formed the divergent passage while the <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust</b> ejected or pumped the secondary flow from the intake ramp bleed slot.|$|E
25|$|A muffler is {{a device}} for {{reducing}} the amount of noise emitted by a machine. On internal combustion engines, the <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust</b> blows out through the muffler. The internal combustion engine muffler was invented by Milton O. Reeves who received a patent in 1897.|$|E

25|$|Olympus driving aft fan: BS.81 {{rated at}} 28,000lb. As an {{alternative}} to afterburning a fan mounted at {{the trailing edge of}} the wing was proposed for the Vulcan Phase 6. The fan was driven by a turbine in the <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust</b> {{at the end of the}} jetpipe.|$|E
25|$|The three-bearing swivel module (3BSM) is a thrust {{vectoring}} nozzle at {{the tail}} of the aircraft which allows the main turbofan cruise <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust</b> to pass either straight through with reheat capability for forward propulsion in conventional flight, or to be deflected downward to provide aft vertical lift.|$|E
25|$|Diesel-powered motorships {{do not use}} steam boilers as part {{of their}} main {{propulsion}} system and so may not have steam supplies available to drive evaporators. Some do, as they use auxiliary boilers for non-propulsion tasks such as this. Such boilers may even be heat-recovery boilers that are heated by the <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust.</b>|$|E
25|$|Flares burn at {{thousands}} of degrees, {{which is much}} hotter than the exhaust of a jet engine. IR missiles seek out the hotter flame, believing {{it to be an}} aircraft in afterburner or the beginning of the <b>engine's</b> <b>exhaust</b> source.|$|R
50|$|A {{turboprop}} {{engine is}} a turbine engine that drives an aircraft propeller. In {{contrast to a}} turbojet, the <b>engine's</b> <b>exhaust</b> gases do not contain enough energy to create significant thrust, since {{almost all of the}} engine's power is used to drive the propeller.|$|R
