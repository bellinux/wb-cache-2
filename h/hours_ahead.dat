5|$|The British {{squadron}} {{spotted the}} Germans at 05:37 (ship's clocks were set four <b>hours</b> <b>ahead</b> of local time – the engagement commenced shortly after dawn), but the Germans were already {{aware of their}} presence, Prinz Eugens hydrophones having previously detected the sounds of high-speed propellers to their southeast. The British opened fire at 05:52 with Hood engaging Prinz Eugen, the lead ship in the German formation, and the Germans returned fire at 05:55, both ships concentrating on Hood. Prinz Eugen was probably the first ship to score when a shell hit Hoods boat deck, between her funnels, and started a large fire among the ready-use ammunition for the anti-aircraft guns and rockets of the UP mounts.|$|E
5|$|Truman {{seems to}} recover, {{but the next}} day, the {{producers}} find Truman sleeping in his basement. Marlon is sent to check on Truman, only to find he has disappeared through a makeshift tunnel. Marlon breaks character, and Christof orders the first transmission cut in the show's history while a citywide search for Truman is launched, going to such extreme measures as causing the artificial sun to rise <b>hours</b> <b>ahead</b> of schedule. Audiences {{around the world are}} drawn to this sudden change. Truman is found sailing out of Seahaven, having conquered his fear of water, and Christof resumes the broadcast as he sends a man-made lightning storm to try to capsize the boat. Network executives fear that Truman may die on live television, but Truman manages to persist. Realizing he cannot dissuade Truman any further, Christof ends the storm.|$|E

5|$|When the Kingdom of Montenegro {{declared}} war on Turkey on 8 October 1912, it was joined quickly by Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece in {{what is known as}} the First Balkan War. George was on vacation in Denmark, so he immediately returned to Greece via Vienna, arriving in Athens to be met by a large and enthusiastic crowd on the evening of 9 October. The results of this campaign differed radically from the Greek experience at the hands of the Turks in 1897. The well-trained Greek forces, 200,000 strong, won victory after victory. On 9 November 1912, Greek forces commanded by Crown Prince Constantine rode into Thessaloniki, just a few <b>hours</b> <b>ahead</b> of a Bulgarian division. Three days later King George rode in triumph through the streets of Thessaloniki, the second-largest Greek city, accompanied by the Crown Prince and Venizelos.|$|E

Braxton Bragg hoped to trap Negley by attacking through the cove from the northeast, forcing the Union division to its destruction at the cul-de-sac at the southwest {{end of the}} valley. Early {{on the morning of}} September 10, Bragg ordered Polk's division under Maj. Gen. Thomas C. Hindman to march 13 miles southwest into the cove and strike Negley's flank. He also ordered D.H. Hill to send Cleburne's division from LaFayette through Dug Gap to strike Negley's front, making sure the movement was coordinated with Hindman's.|$|E

Unlike the previous rallies, the police did not mobilise the Federal Reserve Unit or use water cannons and tear gas on the protesters, but placed them on standby. After various events on the first day which included speeches and exercise activities, hundreds of participants began bedding down for the night in tents and sleeping mats in areas around the vicinity of Dataran Merdeka.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{analyzes}} {{the importance of}} the wind farm wind speed prediction, as well as the different forecasting methods in various fields. And established the RBF neural network forecasting model can forecast one <b>hour</b> <b>ahead</b> of the wind farm wind speed, and the results meet the actual forecast requirements. By reconstructing the wind speed time series, wind speed can be predicted one day in advance, the prediction accuracy and one <b>hour</b> <b>ahead</b> of forecast accuracy is similar. The method can predict {{a longer period of time}} the wind speed, and provide important reference for the wind farm power generation scheduling...|$|R

25|$|On flight day 12, {{the crew}} of space shuttle Discovery secured the MPLM Leonardo in the payload bay for return to earth. Mission {{specialist}} Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger activated the latches to secure Leonardo in the payload bay at 07:15 UTC (03:15 EDT). After Leonardo was secured, Metcalf-Lindenburger, pilot Jim Dutton began the late inspection of Discoverys heat shield. The pair were joined by commander Alan Poindexter and mission specialist Naoko Yamazaki to complete the inspection of the shuttle's Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) panels on the wings and nose and the heat-resistant tiles. The scan which takes about 7 hours was completed 3 <b>hours</b> <b>ahead</b> of schedule, and was done while still docked to the International Space Station (ISS) due {{to the loss of}} the shuttles Ku-Band antenna.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Poole died two weeks later, a massive search for Baker took place. Morrissey and Dan Kerrigan were accused as {{accessories}} to the murder, the latter suspected of helping Baker escape the city, but neither men were ever indicted. Baker hid out in New Jersey {{for a time}} before fleeing the country altogether. Authorities managed {{to catch up to}} Baker, using the clipper yacht Grapeshot provided by George Law, and took him into custody less than 100 miles west of the Canary Islands; another version claims that he was captured after arriving at Tenerife with the police having arrived two <b>hours</b> <b>ahead</b> of Baker. Brought back to New York, Baker stood trial and twice appeared before the state supreme court before his acquittal by a Tammany Hall judge in 1856.|$|E
25|$|The {{early warning}} {{provided}} was useless against ICBMs and submarine-launched attacks. These were countered and {{tempered by the}} MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) philosophy. However, the scenario of a coordinated airborne invasion coupled with a limited nuclear strike was the real threat that this line protected against. It did so by providing Distant Early Warning of an inbound aerial invasion force, which would have to appear at the far north <b>hours</b> <b>ahead</b> of any warhead launches {{in order to be}} coordinated well enough to prevent MAD. A number of intermediate stations were decommissioned, since their effectiveness was judged to be less than desired and required. The manned stations were retained to monitor potential Soviet air activities and to allow Canada to assert sovereignty in the Arctic. International law requires a country that claims territory to actively occupy and defend such territory.|$|E
