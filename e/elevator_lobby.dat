5|$|The {{building}} {{opened for}} {{business as a}} hotel on January 15, 2015. It {{is the first of}} what was planned to be twenty Virgin Hotels locations that operate under this business model. The renovation took longer than planned due to the building's city landmark status, which required continuing coordination with the Commission on Chicago Landmarks. Original features that were retained include a 1920s oak cigar bar, brass <b>elevator</b> <b>lobby</b> doors and a tiled ceiling. The final layout of 250 rooms includes 40 single-room suites and 2 penthouse suites. 40 rooms are pet friendly.|$|E
25|$|Like the Chrysler Building, One Liberty Place has {{a square}} shape with {{recessed}} corners. The facade is also {{inspired by the}} Chrysler Building, using glass and aluminum to invoke the Chrysler Building's horizontal and vertical shapes along the building's core. The facade's color ranges between grays, silver, and metallic blues and uses horizontal bands of granite and glass to de-emphasize the visual impact of {{the height of the}} tower. The building's lobby features white and gray marble imported from Italy. The <b>elevator</b> <b>lobby</b> and the elevator cabs echo the shape of the building's spire while the elevator doors feature abstraction of One Liberty Place itself.|$|E
500|$|The Shamrock {{initially}} had a {{staff of}} 1,200 managed by George Lindholm, who had been recruited from the socially prominent Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York. There were 23 different employee uniforms. Guests signed the register in [...] "grass-hued" [...] green ink and their luggage was carried by bellhops wearing emerald green, lemon trimmed uniforms past a portrait of McCarthy in the <b>elevator</b> <b>lobby</b> to air-conditioned, green-hued rooms each with generously framed abstract art on the walls, push-button radios (including recorded music from an elaborate in-house system through which an operator played extended-length phonographic records) and television, all somewhat rare amenities for a hotel at the time. Over {{a third of the}} rooms had kitchenettes. Celebrity singers (including Lamour) performed in the hotel's nightclub, called the Emerald room. From 1949 to 1953 the Shamrock hosted a network radio program called Saturday at the Shamrock carried by the American Broadcasting Company, then the only nationally broadcast scripted radio program produced outside New York or Los Angeles.|$|E

2500|$|For most seasons, the {{candidates}} ostensibly {{live in a}} communal suite at Trump Tower in Manhattan. This was originally billed as a penthouse suite, and after boardrooms, candidates were told to [...] "go up" [...] to the suite. However, in reality, the suite and the boardroom (and its <b>elevator</b> <b>lobby)</b> are all purpose-built sets within Trump Tower, {{all on the same}} floor. Later seasons of The Celebrity Apprentice no longer conceal this.|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} features two street entrances and one subway entrance. The [...] tall Market Street entrance lobby features {{stairs and}} escalators {{leading up to}} the former banking hall. The black, gray, and white marble lobby features a three-story window with stainless steel mullions set in a flat aluminum frame similar to the windows in the banking hall. The other entrance is on 12th Street. Originally designed for the office workers in the towers, the entrance now leads to the hotel's lobby. Custom Cartier clocks decorate both entrance lobbies and every <b>elevator</b> <b>lobby.</b>|$|E
50|$|As {{part of the}} 2005 restoration, GSA recreated {{historic}} elements {{including the}} original post office window. Portions of the <b>elevator</b> <b>lobbies</b> were redesigned to be more historically accurate.|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{the plan}} of the {{building}} is composed of a long corridor running east-west {{the length of the}} building. At the southeast and southwest corners of the building, the corridors intersect with the <b>elevator</b> <b>lobbies</b> and above the first floor, turn north to service the east and west wings of floors two through nine. The corridors of the upper floors are generally double-loaded, have tile floors, marble and plaster walls and suspended acoustical tile ceilings. The <b>elevator</b> <b>lobbies</b> have the same finishes and feature the original elevator doors and cabs.|$|R
50|$|Other {{original}} interior spaces include <b>elevator</b> <b>lobbies,</b> judges' chambers, and {{the district}} law library. Terrazzo and marble floors, marble wainscot, bronze elevator doors with bas-relief panels, and bronze radiator grilles are found throughout the building.|$|R

50|$|Cast-stone arches {{separate}} the first-floor <b>elevator</b> <b>lobby</b> from the corridors. The original bronze elevator doors remain and bronze {{is also used}} on other historic elements of the <b>elevator</b> <b>lobby,</b> including a mailbox, clocks, telephone booths, and building directory and bulletin board frames. The lobby leads to an internal courtyard that {{is open to the}} sky. Walkways are interspersed with trees, shrubbery, and groundcover plantings.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{is faced with}} Texas Cordova limestone, and {{the doors to the}} building are of a specially cast aluminum. The lobby is walled with lightly veined marble. The gateways to the Tax Department are inlaid with bronze, nickel and silver. The <b>elevator</b> <b>lobbies</b> are treated with marble base, walls and wainscoting.|$|R
50|$|Interior spaces {{consist of}} a grand postal lobby; postal offices and work areas; double-loaded public {{corridors}} with <b>elevator</b> <b>lobbies,</b> several courtrooms including the main ceremonial courtroom on the fourth floor; standard tenant office spaces throughout; and a utilitarian basement. Each of these areas is described in detail in their respective zone descriptions.|$|R
50|$|Other {{important}} public spaces include stair and <b>elevator</b> <b>lobbies</b> and corridors. Walls are generally clad in marble wainscot, and floors {{are covered in}} terrazzo. The plaster ceilings are less ornate than {{those found in the}} ground-floor lobby. Staircases have original brass handrails. The first floor contains an elaborate groin vaulted, terra cotta ceiling with gold-leaf trim, now visible from the main lobby.|$|R

50|$|The Infinite Corridor {{has five}} levels: the basement, and floors 1 through 4. <b>Elevators</b> in <b>Lobby</b> 7 and in Lobby 10 {{provide access to}} each floor, as do {{numerous}} stairways. The <b>elevators</b> in <b>Lobby</b> 10 also provide access to the Barker Engineering Library, via the 5th floor. In accordance with its US location, MIT buildings usually use the American floor numbering scheme.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the building, in {{both public}} and private spaces, {{intricate}} wood inlay designs adorn the ceiling and wall trim. Each of the five floors contains two <b>elevator</b> <b>lobbies</b> with adjacent public staircases. The stairs have treads and landings of Eagle Grey Tennessee marble with Champlain black marble risers. Cast-aluminum railings, also designed by Biafora, contain stylized motifs related to the functions of the building, including an airplane and scales of justice.|$|R

50|$|The {{art deco}} details at the {{exterior}} street level {{and in the}} main banking lobby have been obliterated. The building's main architectural interest lies in the still existent art deco detailing in the building's <b>elevator</b> <b>lobby</b> and upper floors.|$|E

50|$|The {{interior}} of the building was renovated in 1983-1984, when the original steel windows were replaced. The public <b>elevator</b> <b>lobbies</b> and major courtrooms retain their original finishes and locations, although interior corridors and office spaces are altered. In 1985, GSA's Art in Architecture program commissioned two oil-on-canvas paintings titled The Effects of Good and Bad Government from artist Caleb Ives Bach. Originally located in the lobby, the paintings were conserved in 2008 and reinstalled in the law library.|$|R
50|$|The architects {{designed}} the interior spaces to be reserved yet dramatic. The entrance lobby is both {{one and two}} stories in height and forms an irregular polygonal footprint with walls that splay outward. The space is defined by piers sheathed in black Alberene, a type of soapstone, and grey marble covers the walls. Recessed cove lighting illuminates the lobby. The first floor <b>elevator</b> <b>lobbies</b> are lit by a luminous rear wall. The elevator doors have a satin bronze finish with fluted horizontal bands.|$|R
50|$|While {{the exact}} layouts {{of the upper}} floors varies {{depending}} on the original uses, the general layout of corridors and offices is very similar. The <b>elevator</b> <b>lobbies</b> line up vertically above the main <b>lobby,</b> with <b>elevators</b> and stairs on the west side, and restrooms located {{on the east side}} of the lobbies. There are generally offices around the perimeter of the building with H-shaped or pentagonal corridors just to the interior of the offices. The mechanical and support spaces are centralized.|$|R
