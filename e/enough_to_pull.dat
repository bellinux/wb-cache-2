In all games, Sullivan wears a bowling-style shirt, dockers pants, and chews on a cigar wherever he goes. He is constantly in enormous debt, but is likable <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> people into investing in his ventures.|$|E
5|$|During that night, a storm blew up and {{approximately}} 200 soldiers {{were assigned to}} the task of restraining the airship in the gale-force winds. On Saturday morning, the wind was strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> some of the iron pickets anchoring the airship out of the ground so that she swung broadside to the wind, causing her to tip on her side, which in turn caused sacks of ballast to be released. Even then the Patrie could have been saved; had the release cord been attached to the gas-bag, a single tug on the cord would have been enough to release the hydrogen and save the ship. An oversight led to this not being done, the troops were unable to keep control her and thus could not continue to hold her down in the storm.|$|E

5|$|Friday {{made his}} debut for Walthamstow on 27 March 1971, against Bromley, {{coming off the}} bench to set up Walthamstow's equaliser. His first goal came on 17 April, when playing against Tooting & Mitcham he once again {{appeared}} as a substitute and scored a header late in the game. He joined west London club Hayes in December 1971 after scoring twice against them in an Isthmian League match. Hayes offered £30 per week, and were also based closer {{to his home in}} Acton. A near-fatal accident at work in July 1972 caused Friday to undergo extensive surgery; while working on a roof in Lambeth, a hoist rope became stuck on the scaffold he was working on. The Hayes forward attempted to free the rope but fell and landed on a large spike: the spike went up through one of his buttocks, through his stomach and narrowly avoided a lung. Not only was Friday strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> himself off the spike, he recovered from his injuries within three months and returned to the Hayes team in October 1972.|$|E
5|$|Nancy decides {{the only}} way to end this is to pull Krueger out of their dreams and kill him in reality. Quentin tries to stay awake long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> Nancy out of her dream when she has Krueger, but he falls asleep and is attacked. Krueger goes after Nancy, and {{explains}} that he intentionally left her for last so she would stay awake long enough that, when she finally fell asleep, she would {{no longer be able to}} wake up. Quentin uses the adrenaline to wake up Nancy, who pulls Krueger into reality. She uses a broken blade to cut Krueger's gloved hand off, and then slice his throat. She then torches the secret room, with Krueger's body inside, and she and Quentin leave. Nancy and her mother return home from the hospital; Krueger suddenly appears and kills Nancy's mother before pulling her body through a mirror while Nancy screams.|$|E
25|$|The usual {{breakdown}} {{route is}} that the field strength becomes large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> electrons in the dielectric from their atoms thus causing conduction. Other scenarios are possible, such as impurities in the dielectric, and, if the dielectric is of a crystalline nature, imperfections in the crystal structure can result in an avalanche breakdown as seen in semi-conductor devices. Breakdown voltage is also affected by pressure, humidity and temperature.|$|E

25|$|Louisville {{dominated}} top-seeded Washington, using a big spurt late in {{the first}} half and then cruising from there. After an evenly matched sixteen minutes that saw Washington lead 30-29, Louisville went on an 18-5 run to close the first half, with the big shots coming from Francisco García, who nailed two three-pointers during that stretch to extend the lead. Washington tried a second-half comeback, cutting Louisville's lead to 67-61 with 8:41 left, but Louisville had <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> away.|$|E
25|$|Soon after tram {{operations}} were started, many problems arose. The hilly terrain of Kiev presented the largest problem. On Bohdan Khmelnytsky Street, {{a pair of}} horses was not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> the trams uphill. Therefore, another two pairs of horses were added, which did not improve the situation. Thus, mechanizing the tram using a steam-powered engine was attempted {{as a solution to}} the problem. However, the steam engines produced a lot of noise, which scared the horses and people, and produced a lot of air pollution.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the utility}} of the horse as a means of {{transportation}} became clear the horses (actually ponies) began being bred for strength, and by the 3rd millennium BC they were strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> chariots. By 2000 BC, war chariots had spoked wheels, thus being made more manoeuvrable, and dominated the battlefields. The growing use of the horse, combined with the failure, roughly around 2000 BC, of the always precarious irrigation systems that had allowed for extensive agriculture in the region, gave rise and dominance of pastoral nomadism by 1000 BC, {{a way of life that}} would dominate the region for the next several millennia.|$|E

25|$|In Robinson's model, {{both the}} {{downstroke}} and the upstroke {{would have been}} powerful. In 1982, she was criticised by Samuel Tarsitano, Eberhard Frey and Jürgen Riess, who claimed that, while the muscles at {{the underside of the}} shoulder and pelvic plates were clearly powerful <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> the limbs downwards, comparable muscle groups on the top of these plates to elevate the limbs were simply lacking, and, had they been present, could not have been forcefully employed, their bulging carrying the danger of hurting the internal organs. They proposed a more limited flying model in which a powerful downstroke was combined with a largely unpowered recovery, the flipper returning to its original position by the momentum of the forward moving and temporarily sinking body. This modified flying model became a popular interpretation. Less attention was given to an alternative hypothesis by Stephen Godfrey in 1984, which proposed that both the forelimbs and hindlimbs performed a deep paddling motion to the rear combined with a powered recovery stroke to the front, resembling the movement made by the forelimbs of sea-lions.|$|E

500|$|Vindictive was {{dispatched}} to the Baltic with a dozen aircraft, a mix of Griffins, Sopwith 2F.1 fighters, Sopwith 1½ Strutter and Short Type 184 bombers, on 2 July 1919 {{to participate in the}} British campaign in the Baltic in support of the White Russians and the newly independent Baltic states.

500|$|Justin Chang of Variety {{said the}} film was [...] "a wham-bam sequel noticeably lacking in the pop gravitas, moody atmospherics, and {{emotional}} weight that made the first two Marvel comicbook adaptations so rousingly successful." [...] Frank Lovece of Film Journal International said, [...] "A risk-taking script with genuine consequences elevates this above the lackluster direction of Brett Ratner, whose competent mechanics move the story efficiently but with very little soul." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly called it a [...] ""diminished sequel, a brute-force enterprise" [...] {{and said it was}} an example of [...] "what happens when movies are confused with sandwich shops as franchise opportunities". The Minneapolis Star Tribune characterized Ratner's approach as [...] "Forget subtlety! Let's blow things up!" [...] David Edelstein of New York magazine called it [...] "just another big-budget B-movie. It's a fast and enjoyable B-movie, though." [...] Foreshadowing , Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said, [...] "Last stand? My ass.

500|$|Whilst Lynette Porter {{thought that}} Gwen became a [...] "fallen woman" [...] through her affair with Owen, she {{observed}} that this made Gwen's role {{in relation to}} Jack in [...] "End of Days", analogous to that of Mary Magdalene to Jesus, reinforcing a prevalent biblical subtext. Gwen keeps a vigil at Jack's [...] "Torchwood tomb" [...] and like Magdalene is rewarded for her loyalty by being the first to lay eyes upon the risen saviour. Valerie Frankel surmised that [...] "Gwen's journey is one we all face [...] she discovers the dominant intuition within, and then embraces it within the darkest caves of her inner self". David Cornelius stated that Gwen's Torchwood adventures {{take her to the}} brink, and additionally show [...] "she's strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> herself back". Stephen James Walker also felt that Gwen is still a redeemable character because she recognises her own moral failings, as seen in [...] "Combat" [...] where she sits alone sobbing over pizza, before picking herself up and trying to do better in the future. On this track, Torchwood actor Kai Owen justified Gwen's treatment of Rhys in her darkest moments by arguing that Gwen's intentions always remained pure, no matter how badly she treated Rhys.|$|E
500|$|The first {{wild animal}} to be domesticated was the dog. Half-wild dogs, perhaps {{starting}} with young individuals, {{may have been}} tolerated as scavengers and killers of vermin, and being naturally pack hunters, were predisposed {{to become part of}} the human pack and join in the hunt. Prey animals, sheep, goats, pigs and cattle, were progressively domesticated early in the history of agriculture. Pigs were domesticated in Mesopotamia around 13,000 BC, and sheep followed, some time between 11,000 and 9,000 BC. Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan around 8,500 BC. A cow was a great advantage to a villager as it produced more milk than its calf needed, and its strength could be put to use, pulling a plough to increase production of crops, and drawing a sledge, and later a cart, to bring the produce home from the field. Draught animals were first used about 4,000 BC in the Middle East, increasing agricultural production immeasurably. In southern Asia, the elephant was domesticated by 6,000 BC. Fossilised chicken bones dated to 5040 BC have been found in northeastern China, far from where their wild ancestors lived in the jungles of tropical Asia, but archaeologists believe that the original purpose of domestication was for the sport of cockfighting. [...] Meanwhile in South America, the llama and the alpaca had been domesticated, probably before 3,000 BC, as beasts of burden and for their wool. Neither was strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> a plough which limited the development of agriculture in the New World.|$|E
