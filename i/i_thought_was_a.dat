500|$|I {{can only}} {{remember}} {{bits and pieces}} of the game. I was psyched. I had a feeling of euphoria. I was zeroed in on the [...] glove, but I didn't hit the glove too much. I remember hitting a couple of batters, and the bases were loaded two or three times. The ball was small sometimes, the ball was large sometimes, sometimes I saw the catcher, sometimes I didn't. Sometimes, I tried to stare the hitter down and throw while I was looking at him. I chewed my gum until it turned to powder. I started having a crazy idea in the fourth inning that Richard Nixon was the home plate umpire, and once I thought I was pitching a baseball to Jimi Hendrix, who to me was holding a guitar and swinging it over the plate. They say I had about three to four fielding chances. I remember diving {{out of the way of}} a ball <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> line drive. I jumped, but the ball wasn't hit hard and never reached me.|$|E
500|$|For authenticity, several British and German actors {{portrayed the}} British sailors and Nazi soldiers, whose {{dialogue}} was mostly in German. Trevor Goddard, who portrayed the First British Crewman, is English, while Madison Mason, who played Captain Yip Harburg, is American; he affected an English accent for the part. William B. Davis' dialogue was entirely in German, a language {{which he did}} not speak. He later explained, [...] "I certainly didn't realize I was going to be speaking a lot of German until I got the script, which just said 'CSM (in German)'." [...] To successfully learn his lines, one of the German cast members recorded all of Davis' dialogue onto a cassette. Davis was given the cassette two weeks before shooting and phonetically memorized his lines; he noted that the method [...] "seemed to work pretty well—at least to non-German-speaking people! It was a little more challenging because there were some real German speakers on the show, which <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little unfair." [...] The only main cast member of The X-Files who already spoke German was Mitch Pileggi. Pileggi had studied in Germany; he had to re-write many of his lines as they made no sense {{in the context of the}} scenes. The tagline that usually appears after the opening credits of every episode, [...] "The Truth is Out There", was translated into German: [...] "Die Wahrheit ist irgendwo da draußen".|$|E

500|$|After the Beatles {{completed}} their second Hamburg residency, they enjoyed increasing popularity in Liverpool {{with the growing}} Merseybeat movement. However, they were also growing tired of the monotony of numerous appearances at the same clubs night after night. In November 1961, {{during one of the}} group's frequent performances at The Cavern Club, they encountered Brian Epstein, a local record-store owner and music columnist. He later recalled: [...] "I immediately liked what I heard. They were fresh, and they were honest, and they had what <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> sort of presence... star quality." [...] Epstein courted the band {{over the next couple of}} months, and they appointed him as their manager in January 1962. Throughout early and mid-1962, Epstein sought to free the Beatles from their contractual obligations to Bert Kaempfert Productions. He eventually negotiated a one-month-early release from their contract in exchange for one last recording session in Hamburg. Tragedy greeted them on their return to Germany in April, when a distraught Kirchherr met them at the airport with news of Sutcliffe's death the previous day from what would later be determined to have been a brain hemorrhage. Epstein began negotiations with record labels for a recording contract. In order to secure a UK record contract, Epstein negotiated an early end to the band's contract with Polydor, in exchange for more recordings backing Tony Sheridan. After a New Year's Day audition, Decca Records rejected the band with the comment [...] "Guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein." [...] However, three months later, producer George Martin signed the Beatles to EMI's Parlophone label.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} year, Hall {{landed the}} role of Rusty Griswold, Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo's son, in National Lampoon's Vacation, catching {{the attention of the}} film's screenwriter John Hughes, who was about to make the jump to directing. [...] "For [...] to upstage Chevy, <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> remarkable accomplishment for a 13-year-old kid," [...] said Hughes. The film was a significant box office hit in 1983, grossing over US$61 million in the United States. After Vacation, Hall moved on to other projects and declined to reprise his role in the 1985 sequel.|$|E

[...] "Johnny Handsome" [...] <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> return to form [...] [...] [...] But I thought with 'Geronimo' he went to a really fantastic place. Everybody talked about how boring it was. But I didn't. I thought he made a really great classic Western and America just wasn't worthy of the privilege." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Kansas City Bomber Raquel Welch {{played a}} {{hardened}} derby star and single mother {{that tries to}} balance her desire for a happy personal life and her dreams of stardom. Life dubbed Welch the “hottest thing on wheels” for her role. The production of the film shut down for six weeks after Welch broke her wrist doing some of her own stunts. In the interim, she flew to Budapest and filmed a cameo in Bluebeard (1972) opposite Richard Burton. Although Kansas City Bomber was not considered a critical success, it vividly depicted gender relations in the early 1970s. In a 2012 interview with GQ, Welch reflected on the roller derby world depicted in the film: [...] "You have all those women out there, but {{the men in the}} front office are really running it. Which <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> really nice metaphor for the way a lot of women felt about their lives at that time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Parks {{recorded}} {{only two}} albums during the 1970s, {{but he had}} performed on numerous albums recorded by friends who were working in or around the Los Angeles music scene—notably Harry Nilsson, whom Parks considered the [...] "smartest guy" [...] he had ever met in the music business. During the early 1970s, Parks dealt with prescription drug abuse. He would later say of himself as being [...] "dead for five years", and spent {{the first half of}} the decade [...] "trying to regain an interest in living." [...] Parks later stated, [...] "When I was head of audio-visual services and on the A staff at Warner Bros., a man came into my office and he had a snake and his name was Alice. Right then, I knew that my days were numbered as a person really interested in the record business." [...] Speaking about his department during this time, Parks stated, [...] "I provided that each artist would get 25% of the net profits of the rentals or sales. It was going to be a very promising market for the artist. Warners soon tired of what <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fair equation of participation in creative profits, and basically isolated me." ...|$|E

5000|$|After {{five years}} of solo cabaret shows, Perfect had {{wanted to write a}} {{full-scale}} musical.
