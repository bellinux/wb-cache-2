They all shared certain elements of a common experience: education at St Peter's School and Fort Hare University, living in Sophiatown, working for <b>Drum</b> <b>magazine,</b> exile, banning under the Suppression of Communism Act and for many the writing of an autobiography.|$|E

5|$|The {{representation}} of gangsters {{in the literature}} (<b>Drum</b> <b>magazine)</b> went through very different stages during the 1950s and early 1960s. The first representation is characterized by consistent condemnations of crime as an urban phenomenon that threatens the rural identity of tribal blacks. The second is almost a complete turn-around from the first, as gangsters are portrayed as urban survivors {{who are able to}} achieve a standard of living normally denied to blacks. The final period is an extended period of nostalgia for the shebeen culture that all but disappeared with the destruction of Sophiatown.|$|E

The South African short-story author, Can Themba, who also worked with Nxumalo at <b>Drum</b> <b>magazine,</b> was played by the little-known South African actor, Tumisho Masha. Apart from the British actor Jason Flemyng who took the part of Jim Bailey, the ex-R.A.F. pilot who owned Drum, {{the rest of the}} parts were taken by South African actors, the best known being Zola (credited as Bonginkosi Dlamini) playing the part of Slim, the Sophiatown gang leader.|$|E

25|$|Although the <b>drum</b> <b>magazine</b> {{provided}} significant firepower, {{in military}} service {{it was found}} to be overly heavy and bulky, especially when slung on the shoulder while marching. The M1928A1 Thompson <b>drum</b> <b>magazine</b> was rather fragile, and cartridges tended to rattle inside it, producing unwanted noise. For these reasons, the 20-round and later 30-round box magazines soon proved most popular with military users of the M1928A1, and drum compatibility {{was not included in the}} design of the wartime M1 and M1A1 models. The Thompson was one of the earliest submachine guns to incorporate a double-column, double-feed box magazine design, which undoubtedly contributed to the gun's reputation for reliability. In addition, the gun performed better than most after exposure to rain, dirt, and mud.|$|E

25|$|The {{staff of}} Savage Arms looked {{for ways to}} simplify the M1928A1, {{producing}} a prototype in February 1942 which was tested at Aberdeen Proving Ground in March 1942; Army Ordnance approved adoption as the M1 in April 1942. M1s were made by Savage Arms and by Auto-Ordnance. M1s were issued with the 30-round box magazine and would accept the earlier 20-round box, but would not accept the <b>drum</b> <b>magazine.</b>|$|E

500|$|Drum is a 2004 film {{based on}} the life of South African investigative {{journalist}} Henry Nxumalo, who worked for <b>Drum</b> <b>magazine,</b> called [...] "the first black lifestyle magazine in Africa". It was director Zola Maseko's first film and deals with the issues of apartheid and the forced removal of residents from Sophiatown. The film was originally to be a six-part television series called Sophiatown Short Stories, but Maseko could not get the funding. The lead roles of Henry Nxumalo and Drum main photographer Jürgen Schadeberg were played by American actors Taye Diggs and Gabriel Mann, while {{most of the rest of}} the cast were South African actors.|$|E

The record became the first South African record to chart on the United States Billboard Top 100. In 1957, Makeba was featured on the cover of <b>Drum</b> <b>magazine.</b>|$|E

500|$|House of Music {{expanded}} on Tony! Toni! Toné!'s previous traditional R work {{by emphasizing}} live instrumentation and ballads. In {{the opinion of}} Daily Herald writer Dan Kening, the album continued the band's mix of contemporary R and old-fashioned soul, deeming it [...] "half a tribute to their '60s and '70s soul music roots and half a masterful blend of modern smooth balladeering and danceable funk." [...] Salon critic Jennie Yabroff believed House of Music mostly featured ballads {{in the form of}} [...] "slow, emotional numbers with muted beats" [...] that accentuated the lyrics. According to <b>Drum</b> <b>magazine,</b> mid-tempo songs such as [...] "Thinking of You" [...] and [...] "Still a Man" [...] relied strongly on 1960s R/soul [...] "given a contemporary face", while up-tempo songs such as [...] "Lovin' You", [...] "Don't Fall in Love", and [...] "Let's Get Down" [...] had elements of funk.|$|E
500|$|The {{story is}} based on real events and real people and {{is set in the}} mid-1950s {{freehold}} township of Sophiatown, Johannesburg one of the few areas in South Africa where blacks could own property and drink alcoholic beverages. Drum begins with the central character, sportswriter Henry Nxumalo, reporting on a boxing match with Nelson Mandela. Nxumalo leaves his wife Florence at home while going out into his community's night life and has an affair with a female singer. He works for <b>Drum</b> <b>magazine,</b> which was [...] "the first black lifestyle magazine in Africa." [...] The magazine was financed by whites and had a multiracial staff; it was popular among the black community. Drums British editor, Jim Bailey (Jason Flemyng), asks Nxumalo to write on the township crime scene, and Nxumalo, while at first unwilling, finally agrees. While on the job, he encounters Slim (Zola), a gang leader, that he had previously met in illegal township drinking places, and witnesses him kill a man in Sophiatown.|$|E
