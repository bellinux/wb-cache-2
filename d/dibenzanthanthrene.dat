40|$|Dedicated to {{the memory}} of Professor Jerzy Prochorow The spatial {{distributions}} of individual <b>dibenzanthanthrene</b> electronic transition dipole moments in solid Xe was investigated at the single molecule level, with the high-resolution fluorescence spectroscopy. Samples were prepared by the co-deposition of dibenzanthanthrene/Xe vapours onto the 50 K surface. The results indicate that the orientation of planar aromatic molecules is preferentially parallel to the trapping surface. PACS numbers: 33. 50. â€“j, 61. 66. Bi, 61. 66. Hq. 61. 72. Ww 1...|$|E
