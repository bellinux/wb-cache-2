50|$|The Acorn Electron version {{exploits}} {{a division}} {{in the way the}} Electron handles its display: of the seven available graphics modes, two are configured so that the final two of every ten scanlines are blank and are not based on the contents of RAM. If 16 scanlines of continuous graphical data are written to a character-block-aligned portion of the screen then they will appear as a continuous block in most modes but in the two non-continuous modes they will be displayed as two blocks of 8 scanlines, separated in the middle by two blank scanlines. In order to keep track of its position within the display, the Electron maintains an internal <b>display</b> <b>address</b> counter. The same counter is used in both the continuous and non-continuous graphics modes and switching modes mid-frame does not cause any adjustment to the counter. Firetrack switches from a non-continuous to a continuous graphics mode partway down the display. By using the palette to mask the top area of the display and taking care about when it changes mode it can shift the continuous graphics {{at the bottom of the}} display down in two pixel increments (rather than the usual eight for vertical scrolling) because the internal display counter is not incremented on blank scanlines during non-continuous graphics modes.|$|E

40|$|In {{preparation}} for the 2000 census, the Census Bureau plans to provide maps with address information to local governments for review and update. The algorithms {{that have been used}} by the Census Bureau in the past have not been flexible enough to pl'ace this kind of text readably on small-scale maps. This paper describes a new non-interactive algorithm which has been developed at the Census Bureau. This algorithm simultaneously considers all the address range text which must be plotted in a certain area of the map and can make incremental adjustments to the location of each text item in the set in order to position it for maximum clarity before any positions are fixed. The flexibility that this approach provides has already made it possible to produce maps that <b>display</b> <b>address</b> ranges, census block numbers, and linear features and their names at a scale significantly smaller than comparable maps produced for the 1990 Census...|$|E

40|$|A {{versatile}} architecture for monolithic low-power high-voltage {{flat-panel display}} drivers is presented. A prototype {{of such a}} driver chip was designed and fabricated in the 100 -V 0. 7 -mum CMOS intelligent interface technology ((IT) -T- 2) of Alcatel MicroElectronics. It features 100 -V output driving capability, while {{the operation of the}} entire driver chip is controlled by means of 3 - to 5 -V digital signals. Special high-voltage level-shifter circuits, based on the dynamic charge control concept, were developed to reduce the internal power consumption of the driver chip to extremely low values of 1 to 2 muW per driver output. A powerful on-chip control unit supports numerous <b>display</b> <b>addressing</b> schemes and very complex multilevel output waveforms can be synthesized. These attractive electrical characteristics, together with the pronounced flexibility and multifunctionality, make this driver architecture ideally suited for a variety of flat-panel displays, especially in battery-powered applications...|$|R
