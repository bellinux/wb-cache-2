40|$|Multispectral {{microscopy}} is {{a method}} of capturing spectral bands using a microscope, and is used to observe specimens on a micron or nano scale. However, these systems are limited because they cannot capture transient phenomena since they cannot capture si-multaneous spectral information. We propose a new method called numerical spectral demultiplexing microscopy (NSDM) which uti-lizes a Raspberry Pi camera to capture RGB measurements and then infer narrow-band multispectral spectra. This is accomplished by training a non-linear regression random forest model based on the spectral sensitivity of the camera which allows for a low-cost, portable, and simultaneous capture multispectral microscopy sys-tem. We use the NSDM system as a bright-field multispectral mi-croscope and a <b>dark-field</b> fluorescence multispectral <b>microscope</b> on an anatomical specimen and show that additional information can be gathered by combining a bright-field and <b>dark-field</b> fluores-cence <b>microscope.</b> ...|$|R

We describe an open-source toolbox, microlith ([URL] which accurately predicts three-dimensional images of a thin specimen observed with any partially coherent imaging system, including coherently illuminated and incoherent, self-luminous specimens. Its accuracy is demonstrated by comparing simulated and experimental bright-field and dark-field images of well-characterized amplitude and phase targets, respectively. The comparison provides new insights about the sensitivity of the <b>dark-field</b> <b>microscope</b> to mass distributions in isolated or periodic specimens at the length-scale of 10 nm.

40|$|Examinations {{of fresh}} blood from yellow fever {{patients}} {{by means of}} the <b>dark-field</b> <b>microscope,</b> made in more than twenty-seven cases, revealed in three cases the presence of Leptospira icteroides. In no instance was a large number of organisms found, a long search being required before one was encountered. The injection of the blood into guinea pigs from two of the three positive cases induced in the animals a fatal infection, while the blood from the third positive case failed to infect the guinea pigs fatally. Careful but by no means exhaustive dark-field searches for the leptospira with fresh specimens of blood from the remaining cases of yellow fever ended without positive findings, although four of the specimens, when injected into guinea pigs, caused a fatal leptospira infection. Stained blood film preparations from the corresponding cases were also examined, but the percentage showing the leptospira in the blood was no greater than that found by examination in the fresh state with the <b>dark-field</b> <b>microscope.</b> In fact, owing to the defective stains that were available {{at the time of the}} investigation a great many slides did not take the proper coloration with Giemsa's or Wright's stain and could not be relied upon. Regarding the presence of Leptospira icteroides in various organs both dark-field and stained films were examined. In only one instance so far a few organisms were detected in the emulsion of liver taken shortly after death from a case dying on the 4 th day of yellow fever. This part of the work will be reported later upon completion. Examinations of the urine from different cases of yellow fever were made both by <b>dark-field</b> <b>microscope</b> and by inoculation into guinea pigs. The results were totally negative in thirteen cases, including many convalescents, but in one case one of the guinea pigs inoculated with 10 cc. of the urine came down on the 15 th day with suggestive symptoms (suspicion of jaundice, and some hemorrhagic and parenchymatous lesions of the lungs and kidneys). This specimen showed no leptospira by dark-field examination. In experimental infection of guinea pigs with Leptospira icteroides the blood became infective in many instances 48 hours after inoculation, and was always infective after 72 hours. The liver and kidney become infective simultaneously with the blood. Detection of the organism {{by means of the}} <b>dark-field</b> <b>microscope</b> has seldom been accomplished before the 5 th day. The organisms are most abundant on the 6 th to the 7 th day, but become fewer or completely disappear before death. In the meanwhile the number of organisms increases in the liver and kidney, from which they disappear as the jaundice and other symptoms become aggravated. When death occurs these organs seem to have lost most of the leptospira) and positive transfer by means of them is less certain. At the later stage of the disease the blood is often free from the organisms and ceases to be infective. Positive transmission with blood obtained from moribund animals is not impossible, however, even when no leptospira can be detected under the <b>dark-field</b> <b>microscope...</b>|$|E

MPL values for fibrils formed by residues 218 – 289 of the HET-s fungal prion protein, for 2 -fold- and 3 -fold-symmetric fibrils formed by the 40 -residue β-amyloid peptide, and for fibrils formed by the yeast prion protein Sup 35 NM are in good agreement with previous results from scanning transmission electron microscopy. Results for fibrils formed by the yeast prion protein Rnq 1, for which the MPL value has not been previously reported, support an in-register parallel β-sheet structure, with one Rnq 1 molecule per 0. 47 -nm β-sheet repeat spacing.

This dissertation delineates a novel method of alignment and three-dimensional position metrology that is compatible with many forms of proximity lithography. The method is called Interferometric-Spatial-Phase Imaging (ISPI), {{and is based on}} encoding three-dimensional position information in the spatial phase and frequency of interference fringes, viewed with specialized oblique-incidence, <b>dark-field</b> optical <b>microscopes.</b> Alignment detectivity is 500 gm. Unlike amplitude-based interferometers, this spatial-phase-encoding interferometer achieves high alignment detectivity without sensitivity to variations in wavelength, gap and other factors, such as resist layers and changes in the index of refraction in the beampath. Several novel gap detection methods are introduced, with gap detectivity 500 jgm. (cont.) Gap is confirmed with exposure of patterns in resist, taking advantage of near-field interference in a novel Chirped Talbot Effect. Alignment and pattern overlay are confirmed in experiments combining x-ray exposures with continuous ISPI position feedback. Dynamic overlay of patterns in resist is demonstrated to be 2. 7 nm, with a clear path for further improvement. Gate structures in a double-gate MOSFET are dynamically aligned to 2. 5 nm. by Euclid Eberle Moon. Thesis (Ph. D.)

The motility in broth and spreading ability on semi-solid medium of these mutants {{as well as}} flagellar morphology were ex-amined by dark field and electron microscopy. They were classified into the following five mutant types, heteromorphous, small-amplitude, para-curly, short and hooked-curly. Each of these mutants manifests its characteristic flagellar shape and motility, and the spreading ability of these mutants on semi-solid m,edium decreases in the order: normal, heteromorphous, small-amplitude, para-curly, short, hooked-curly, curly. Except in the small-amplitude and short mutants, {{the shape of a}} flagellar bundle of living bacteria under the <b>dark-field</b> <b>microscope</b> corre-sponded in each mutant to a spiral of the flagella observed under the electron microscope.

40|$|Fourteen typical {{cases of}} yellow fever were studied in {{northern}} Peru during an epidemic occurring in 1920, nine in Payta in March and April, and five in Morropon and Piura in April and May. The method of investigation {{was similar to}} that previously employed, but as the laboratory facilities were very meager certain changes were required. Although in Payta the work was handicapped by the lack of electric light, the scarcity of water and animal food, the unsuitability of the guinea pigs for inoculation, and the changes in culture media due to age, the results obtained under these adverse conditions were by no means negative. While in no instance was there a typical infection produced in animals, either by direct inoculation of blood or with culture materials, yet certain guinea pigs in each series showed temporary febrile reactions or definite hemorrhagic lesions of the lungs indicative of a mild leptospira infection. Direct search for Leptospira icteroides in the blood of patients or in culture materials was not made because the <b>dark-field</b> <b>microscope</b> could not be used. Subsequently, at Piura, the laboratory facilities were vastly, improved, the use of the <b>dark-field</b> <b>microscope</b> was made possible by means of a storage battery, and a fresh stock of young healthy guinea pigs was received from New York, and fresh rabbit serum obtained in Piura. In the study of the materials obtained from five cases of yellow fever in Morropon all these added facilities were taken advantage of, with the result that the outcome was positive and convincing. Cultures from the five cases were examined after 11, 12, and 13 days, and in those from three cases living leptospiras were found. By inoculation into suitable guinea pigs of culture material from these five cases, irrespective of whether or not leptospiras were detected under the <b>dark-field</b> <b>microscope,</b> a typical Leptospira icteroides infection was produced from four of the five cases. In one of these no leptospira had been detected in the culture tubes. Thus one case only yielded negative results, in that no leptospiras were found under the <b>dark-field</b> <b>microscope</b> and the animal inoculation was negative. The leptospira was demonstrated in the blood or organ emulsions of the infected guinea pigs, and further transmission of each strain to other guinea pigs was obtained and pure cultures were secured. A few points of practical significance appeared {{in the course of the}} present investigation. One is the importance of using fresh rabbit serum for culture media. Old rabbit serum, whether in pure form or incorporated with agar, etc., which had been kept for several months in a tropical climate, proved to be unsatisfactory for obtaining a growth of Leptospira icteroides. A second point of interest is the variation in susceptibility of guinea pigs to infection with Leptospira icteroides. In two of four series of positive animal inoculations with the Morropon culture materials only one-half of the guinea pigs inoculated with given materials developed typical symptoms. The other half either suffered from a transient mild infection, as evidenced by a few hemorrhagic foci in the lungs, or escaped infection altogether. From these facts it is highly probable that the lung lesions and febrile reactions observed in certain guinea pigs inoculated with the Payta materials were due to a mild leptospira infection. In a comparative experiment the native guinea pigs procured in Payta were found to be more resistant to the leptospira infection than those recently brought from New York. In fact, only a small portion of the former succumbed to typical infection even when inoculated with a virulent strain of Leptospira icteroides obtained from the Morropon epidemic. In conclusion it may be stated that of fourteen cases of yellow fever studied in Peru, a typical leptospira infection, together with the demonstration of the organism in experimentally infected guinea pigs, was obtained in four, while in the majority of instances indications of a mild, non-fatal leptospira infection were observed. In a few cases only were the results entirely negative. The leptospira isolated from Morropon cases of yellow fever, which is morphologically and culturally identical with the Guayaquil and Merida strains of Leptospira icteroides, was also shown by immunity test to be indistinguishable from the Guayaquil organism...|$|E

40|$|Scattering and {{absorption}} {{belong to}} the major problems in imaging the internal layers of a biological specimen. Due to the structural inhomogeneity of the specimen, {{the distribution of the}} structures in the upper layers of a given internal structure of interest is different from the lower layers that may result in different interception of scattered light, falling into the angular aperture of the microscope objective, from the object in each imaging view. Therefore, different spatial frequencies of the scattered light can be acquired from different (top and bottom) views. We have arranged an opposed-view <b>dark-field</b> digital holographic <b>microscope</b> (DHM) to collect the scattered light concurrently from both views with the aim to increase the contrast of internal structures and improve the signal-to-noise ratio.

40|$|An {{automated}} {{diagnostic test}} instrument and its development program are described. The instrument automates the {{fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption test}} for syphilis {{to the extent}} that only 4 hr of technician time is required to conduct approximately 200 tests daily. Evaluation to date suggests its efficacy. In addition, preliminary studies indicate the feasibility of detecting antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium malariae, and nucleoprotein (antinuclear factor). The instrument would seem to have broad application for routine and research immunofluorescence testing. Two elements comprise the instrument: a slide processor and a microscope attachment. The slide processor is an electro-pneumatically actuated device which automatically feeds special laboratory slides, on which antigen or other reagents are prefixed, through a series of operations which provide reagent application, incubation, washing, drying, and stacking of the finished slides for readout. The instrument provides flexibility in that incubation time and temperature as well as point, sequence, and duration of reagent application can be varied to accommodate a variety of immunofluorescence techniques. The microscope attachment can be fitted to all conventional <b>dark-field</b> fluorescence <b>microscopes</b> and makes possible the reading of three to six slides per minute. The reacted slides from the processor are injected sequentially onto the stage of the microscope by movement of a lever. As injected, slides are automatically in visual focus; fine focus is occasionally required. Scanning of the reacted field is accomplished by means of the normal microscope controls. A buffered glycerol coupling is maintained between the darkfield condenser substage lens and the slide cover glass by means of a pushbutton-actuated feed system...|$|R

Whilst the physics of noble metal nanoparticles at a simple interface is well studied, their behaviour inside a thin film structure is not. This work investigates the effect that placement in a thin dielectric film has on the excited modes and the directional scattering from various geometries of nanoparticle; {{the focus is on}} the fundamental principles but the application of this work in light trapping and nanoantenna design is also discussed. Research is conducted using finite-difference time-domain simulations and a custom built <b>dark-field</b> Fourier-space <b>microscope,</b> designed to interrogate individual particles and measure their angular scattering in thin films for the first time. It is found that the excited modes, large angle scattering and substrate coupling of the nanoparticles can be manipulated and improved considerably through careful choice of the materials and dimensions of the layers. Scattering from silver nanowires into a substrate is observed experimentally for the first time and an overcoating thin film is exploited to create highly directional emission, which is compared with nanoantennas in the literature. The potential to use this system as a novel sensing element is discussed. Following on from this, the nanocube patch antenna system is reviewed and its operation as a subwavelength plasmonic gas sensor is demonstrated for the first time to test for relative humidity using the Nafion polymer. This easily fabricable system shows superior sensitivities to other single-particle sensors across a range of humidities and simulations predict that by using sharper cubes and different deposition processes a further tripling of the recorded efficiency is achievable. The nanopatch structure can be readily adapted to detect a variety of other gases, and has the potential for integration into photonic circuitry. </p...|$|R
40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{relationship}} between nanostructures and magnetic properties of FeTiO 3 -Fe 2 O 3 solid-solution thin films, we have carried out <b>dark-field</b> transmission electron <b>microscope</b> (DF-TEM) and high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) {{scanning transmission electron microscope}} (STEM) observations. The ordered-phase films show strong ferrimagnetic properties while the films identified as the disordered phase according to x-ray diffraction are weakly ferrimagnetic with high saturation fields, in contrast to completely disordered FeTiO 3 -Fe 2 O 3 solid solution for which antiferromagnetic properties or rather small magnetizations are expected. The DF-TEM and HAADF-STEM observations revealed that the ordered-phase films typically consist of cation-ordered domains of over 200 nm and that the Fe and Fe-Ti layers stacked alternately along the c axis, which leads to strong ferrimagnetic properties, are clearly distinguishable from each other. On the other hand, the films identified as the disordered phase are found to possess short-range ordered structure with antiphase boundaries distributed in cation-disordered matrix, rather than completely random cation distribution, explaining why the films are weakly ferrimagnetic with high saturation fields. The results demonstrate the significance of atomic-level observation of the cation distribution in this system for understanding the magnetic properties...|$|R

This study was justified by the disagreement among different authors: only some of them reported gingivitis development and changes in dental plaque composition during orthodontic therapy with fixed appliances, others did not. Thirty, 7 -to- 15 -year-old children, fifteen with fixed and fifteen with removable appliances, previously motivated to oral hygiene, completed the study. They were clinically examined by a dentist at baseline and at the end of the study. Three supra and subgingival microflora samples were collected from the first molars, when the appliances were inserted (T 0), 6 - 8 weeks later (T 1) and 6 - 7 months later (T 2). Microflora was examined using <b>dark-field</b> and light <b>microscopes</b> and cultural methods. An indicator of healthy status (percentage of Gram positive cocci in total bacterial count) and some risk indicators for gingivitis (bacterial count evaluated with light microscope, percentage of Gram negative rods) and for periodontitis (motile rod and spirochete percentages, presumptive Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis prevalence) were investigated. Patients with fixed appliances were clinically healthy at T 2; yet they showed significantly increased counts, motile rods, subgingival spirochetes and a decrease of Gram positive cocci. At T 2, patients with removable appliances were clinically healthy and the only significant microbiological changes were supragingival motile rods and subgingival spirochetes. These data suggest that in the oral hygiene motivated patients of the present study, gingivitis and periodontitis do not occur, {{during the first six}} months of treatment: the significant modification of oral microbiota, shown by subjects with fixed appliances, however, suggests that the risk for gingivitis in the following months of therapy is still high and the risk for periodontitis cannot be excluded...|$|R
40|$|The {{microscopic}} agglutination test (MAT) is {{the gold}} standard for sero-diagnosis of leptospirosis because of its unsurpassed diagnostic specificity. It uses panels of live leptospires, ideally recent isolates, representing the circulating serovars from the area where the patient became infected. A dilution series of the patient's serum is mixed with a suspension of live leptospires in microtiter plates. After incubating for about 2 hr at 30 °C, results are read under the <b>dark-field</b> <b>microscope.</b> The titer is the last dilution in which ≥ 50 % of the leptospires have remained agglutinated. Seroconversion or ≥ 4 -fold titer rise in paired sera is consistent with current leptospirosis. The significance of a titer in a single sample depends on the frequency of residual titers due to past infections and cross-reacting other diseases in the population. Full standardization of the MAT is not possible, but quality assurance can be achieved by participation in the international MAT proficiency testing schem...|$|E
40|$|When peritrichously flagellated cells such as normal, curly, paralysed-curly and small-amplitude {{strains of}} Salmonella abortusequi are {{suspended}} in 0. 5 % methylcellulose solution, flagellar bundles can be clearly seen by electron microscopy. In a bundle, {{five or more}} of the component flagella are tightly united in parallel with each other, and the bundle formed into a helix with a shape characteristic for each strain, These figures reveal the struc-tural detail of the flagellar bundle observed under a <b>dark-field</b> <b>microscope.</b> Ten minutes after the cells were suspended in methylcellulose solution, bundled flagella could be seen in approximately 70 yo of the cells of normal, curly and paralysed-curly strains; the remaining 30 yo were dispersed, At this time among the normal cells, some were single-bundled and others were multi-bundled. The fraction of single-bundled cells was larger in both motile and paralysed curly-flagellated cells than in normal cells. The fraction of normal cells having single bundles increased with time. Methylcellulose was therefore presumed to enhance aggregation of flagella and/or to inhibit the dispersio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Leptospirosis is {{recognized}} as one of the important zoonotic diseases in the world including Malaysia. A total of 145 soil and water samples were collected from selected National Service Training Centres (NSTC) in Kelantan and Terengganu. The samples were inoculated into modified semisolid Ellinghausen McCullough Johnson Harris (EMJH) medium, incubated at room temperature for 1 month and examined under the <b>dark-field</b> <b>microscope.</b> Positive growth of the leptospiral isolates were then confirmed with 8 -Azaguanine Test, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay and Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT). Fifteen cultures (10. 34 %) exhibited positive growths which were seen under dark field microscope whilst only 20 % (3 / 15) were confirmed as pathogenic species. based on 8 -Azaguanine Test and PCR. Serological identification of the isolates with MAT showed that hebdomadis was the dominant serovar in Terengganu. Pathogenic leptospires can be detected in Malaysian environment and this has the potential to cause an outbreak. Therefore, precautionary steps against leptospirosis should be taken by camp authorities to ensure the safety of trainees...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to recent}} advancements in technology, {{consumer}} digital cameras are becoming cheaper {{and easier to}} use. These consumer digital cameras, with Bayer color filter arrays (CFAs), allow for simultaneous capture of the red, green and blue (RGB) channels. To achieve higher spectral resolution, multispectral imaging systems use methods such as filter wheels and tunable filters to capture data in a sequential manner. However, in order to capture transient phenomena, one would need to capture spectral information of a 2 D scene in a simultaneous manner. Therefore, {{there has been an}} on-going trend towards creating a simultaneous multispectral imaging system that uses a conventional consumer digital camera with a Bayer CFA. Such a system allows for a effective imaging of transient or dynamic phenomena with a low-cost and compact system. Currently, the main method to accomplish this is known as Wiener estimation which uses statistical assumptions {{of the relationship between the}} incoming spectra and the RGB measurements. However, these assumptions limit the ability to accurately predict the incoming spectra. Therefore, we leverage a comprehensive framework based on numerical demultiplexing of sensor measurements via spectral characterization of the image sensor CFA and non-linear random forest modeling. To create this numerical demultiplexing system we create a forward model from the spectral sensitivity of the imaging system, which is accomplished with a monochrometer. This forward model is then used to create a mapping of 10, 000 randomly generated spectra to their corresponding RGB values. This mapping acts as our training set for our non-linear inverse model which utilizes the random forest modeling framework. Having constructed the numerical demultiplexer, we test the performance against the state-of-the-art Wiener estimation for both quantitative and qualitative experiments. In the first set of experiments, we performed a quantitative performance assessment of the proposed framework within a controlled simulation environment. The second set of experiments, validated the observations made from the first set of controlled simulation experiments within a real-world setting. More specifically, we used an icon with different colors as well as a scene of different color flowers to perform quantitative analysis. In these experiments, we show that the proposed numerical demultiplexer outperforms the state-of-the art and is a more robust and reliable way to infer higher spectra from RGB measurements. Having validated the numerical demultiplexer, we use it for two applications which are photoplethysmogrpahic imaging and multispectral microscopy. For photoplethysmogrpahic imaging we found that decomposing the RGB camera measurements into narrow-band spectral information can noticeably improve the prediction of heart rate estimation. In addition, we used the numerical demultiplexer for both a bright-field multispectral microscope as well as a <b>dark-field</b> fluorescence multispectral <b>microscope,</b> which illustrates its potential as a low-cost, portable, point-of-care system...|$|R
40|$|Epidemiological {{aspects of}} {{syphilis}} in Western countries have undergone {{a significant change}} {{with respect to the}} number of cases. Detection of Treponema pallidum is difficult, and the correct diagnosis of secondary syphilis can be critical. In this study, biopsy samples from skin lesions of 12 patients with secondary syphilis were used. Diagnosis of syphilis was based on clinical presentation, <b>dark-field</b> <b>microscope</b> analysis, and serological tests. Using a polyclonal antibody directed against T. pallidum, we show the presence of T. pallidum in 90 % of the samples studied with the bacteria located in the epidermis and the upper dermis. The T. pallidum 47 -kDa surface protein gene could be amplified by PCR in 75 % of the skin lesions. When combining both techniques, T. pallidum was detected in 92 % of the samples from patients with secondary syphilis but not in the control samples. Our work suggests that both immunohistochemistry and PCR could be useful for the diagnosis of secondary syphilis and may be helpful in some rare cases when serological assays failed to detect T. pallidum antibodies...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine whether a mobile phone has any {{measurable}} effects on the average erythrocyte aggregation (AEA) in whole undried peripheral blood, and whether a mobileFloww device has any measurable effects on the AEA size in such whole undried peripheral blood. The study was a placebo-controlled double-blind randomised one. The images made with the <b>dark-field</b> <b>microscope</b> were counted in channels. Aggregation was defined by red blood cells that overlapped. Each aggregation was accounted for separately within each image. Cell deformation was defined as cells having a non-round shape that was visually distinctly different from a round shape. The result showed that the mean AEA of the three groups “mobile”, “placebo” and “floww” was 51. 7, 18. 5 and 27. 8 respectively. The median AEA for these three groups was 53. 2, 14. 0 and 4. 1, respectively. No statistically significant differences were established meaning that we could not demonstrate any effect of mobile phone radiation on the AEA of peripheral blood, and, thus, as a consequence we could not establish any possible effect of the “mobileFloww” device...|$|E
