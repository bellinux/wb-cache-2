Hydrogen nuclei, which are protons, made the simplest and most desirable target for interactions with the particles produced by the Bevatron. He began a development program to build a series of small chambers, and championed the device to Ernest Lawrence.|$|E

According to Swanson, Hays made a verbal promise {{that he would have}} no problem with the making of such a film. Swanson set about getting the rights to the play by having Schenck pretend to buy it in the name of United Artists, never to be used. Thus {{they were able to get}} the story rights for $60,000 instead of the original $100,000. When news broke as to <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> intended with the play, the three authors threatened to sue. Swanson later contacted Maugham requesting that he write an original story that served as a sequel. The sequel would involve following what became of Sadie in Australia. Maugham agreed to write a new story (for $100,000) but a sequel was never made.|$|E

500|$|During these years, Carte was {{not just}} the manager of the theatre. He was a full {{participant}} in the producing partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan, involved in casting and finding designers; in charge of publicity; directing and hiring designers for the non-Gilbert works, including the many companion pieces (sometimes with the help of assistants); and casting, directing and rehearsing the touring companies, among other duties. According to Henry Lytton, [...] "Mr. Carte was a great stage manager. He could take in the details of a scene with one sweep of his eagle eye and say unerringly <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> wrong." [...] The quality of Carte's productions created a national and international taste for them, and he sent touring companies throughout the British provinces, to America (generally managed by Helen), Europe and elsewhere. Queen Victoria honoured the company by calling for a Royal Command Performance of The Gondoliers at Windsor Castle in 1891. Following the libretto closely, she noticed additions to the text made by some of the actors and asked Carte to explain why this was done. Carte replied that they [...] "are what we call 'gags'". The queen answered that she had always understood that [...] "gags were things that were put by authority into people's mouths." [...] Carte rejoined, [...] "These gags, Your Majesty, are things people put into their own mouths without authority." [...] George Bernard Shaw, writing in The World in October 1893, stated: ...|$|E
500|$|The tracks [...] "Boyz" [...] and [...] "Bird Flu" [...] use urumee drums, a {{signature}} instrument of Gaana, a Tamil genre of music, with which M.I.A. was familiar from her time spent living in Sri Lanka. She later worked on these tracks in Trinidad, where she absorbed influences from the country's love of soca music. The lyrics of [...] "Boyz" [...] {{deal with the}} artist's time in Jamaica, and reference Jamaican dance moves. The song [...] "Hussel" [...] began as an image in M.I.A.'s head of refugees being smuggled in boats, which she expressed musically by imagining how [...] "if they banged that beat {{on the side of}} a boat, what would it sound like? [...] That's why it's all echo-y and submarine-y". The sounds on the intro were recorded from Keralan [...] fishermen chanting as they pull their fishing boats into the water. [...] "World Town" [...] used instrumentation from the temple music she recalled waking up to as a child in Sri Lanka. After playing the track to children in Liberia, she expressed a desire to record a video for the song there. M.I.A.'s [...] "flat, unaffected vocals and delivery of lyrics" [...] on some songs drew comparisons to British post-punk bands such as Delta 5 and The Slits. She says it [...] "was <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> happening to me naturally...I wanted it to be difficult and raw and not get into it so much".|$|E

In 2007 he predicted a new unit of currency, called the Amero, which would replace the Dollar for this union within 10 years. The [...] "Union" [...] is a theme in two of his books The Late Great U.S.A.: The Coming Merger With Mexico and Canada (2007) and Minutemen: The Battle to Secure America's Borders (2006) as he explained on The Conservative Caucus's TV show. On December 15, 2006 Corsi reported {{for the first time}} he [...] "had found a major intellectual leader behind the push to integrate North America suggesting that a crisis of 9-11 proportions might be <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> needed to advance the process toward establishing a North American Union and the Amero." ...|$|E

2500|$|Big Black's songs {{explored}} {{the dark side}} of American culture in unforgiving detail, acknowledging no taboos. Albini's lyrics openly dealt with such topics as mutilation, murder, rape, child molestation, arson, immolation, racism, and misogyny. [...] "That's <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> interesting to me as a postcollegiate bohemian", he later remarked. [...] "We didn't have a manifesto. Nothing was off-limits; it's just that that's what came up most of the time." [...] Many of his songs told miniature short stories of sociopaths doing evil things that the average person might merely contemplate. Some, such as [...] "Cables", [...] "Pigeon Kill", and [...] "Jordan, Minnesota", were based on real events, or things that Albini had witnessed during his midwest upbringing. He compared the stories to Ripley's Believe It or Not!, saying that [...] "If you stumble across something like this, you think 'This can't be!'

2500|$|Blue Horse {{invariably}} dined with Burbank at {{noon and}} {{always had a}} good appetite. One day, after dinner, Burbank said to Blue Horse: [...] "I notice that you always eat everything in front of you, but you never pass your plate back the second time or ask for another cup of coffee. Why is that? Is it because you cannot eat any more or drink any more coffee. O, yes, he replied, I could eat more, but I thought the twenty-five cents you paid for my dinner was for <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> placed before me. No, I said, the twenty-five cents pays for all you can eat. Hereafter, if one plate is not enough, ask for more, and drink all the coffee you want. All right, he replied, I will. And he did. I also told him to tell his friends this, and suggested that if any white men sitting at his table left anything to eat on their plates before them, {{that it would be}} all right for him to gather it up and take it home for his wife and children. It is needless to say that all the Sioux Indians who patronized that hotel afterward got all that was coming to them.” One time Blue Horse was in the Indian trader's store with his little niece, who saw something on the shelves that she very much wanted. Blue Horse had no money, so he took off his old moccasins and gave them to the Indian trader in exchange for what the little girl craved and he walked home barefooted.|$|E
