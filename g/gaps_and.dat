5|$|Most {{multiple}} sequence alignment methods try {{to minimize}} the number of insertions/deletions (<b>gaps)</b> <b>and,</b> as a consequence, produce compact alignments.

40|$|As a first {{experiment}} {{to observe the}} initial chemical reactions induced by sub-picosecond laser driven shocks in energetic materials, we have investigated thin films of glycidyl azide polymer (<b>GAP)</b> <b>and</b> nitrocellulose (NC). The <b>GAP</b> <b>and</b> NC films were spin coated onto thin film metal layers that had been vapor coated onlo transparent substrates. Sub-picosecond laser pulses were used to launch planar shock waves thro,ugh the metal layer <b>and</b> into the <b>GAP</b> <b>and</b> NC films. Time-resolved displacement measurements of both <b>GAP</b> <b>and</b> NC films suggest that shock-induced chemical reaction may be occurring. While the GAP film velocity falls as expected between that of the A 1 free surface and the particle velocity (using the free surface approximation), the displacement measurements in NC films yield velocities lower than the particle velocity. While data modeling discounting reaction has been unsuccessful, WIR microscopy confirms the presence of unreacted <b>GAP</b> <b>and</b> NC in the shocked regions of the films...|$|R

The surfaces were finished by painting with a thin coat of mortar and silane to resist further erosion and attack by pollutants. The restoration of the façade revealed much paint adhering to the statues and their niches, indicating that it had once been brightly coloured.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Fundamental to {{multiple}} sequence alignment algorithms is modeling insertions <b>and</b> deletions (<b>gaps).</b> The most prevalent model {{is to use}} <b>gap</b> open <b>and</b> <b>gap</b> extension penalties. While <b>gap</b> open <b>and</b> <b>gap</b> extension penalties are well understood conceptually, their effects on multiple sequence alignment, and consequently on phylogeny scores are not as well understood. We use exhaustive phylogeny searching to explore the effects of varying the <b>gap</b> open <b>and</b> <b>gap</b> extension penalties for three nuclear ribosomal data sets. Particular attention is given to optimal phylogeny scores for 200 alignments {{of a range of}} <b>gap</b> open <b>and</b> <b>gap</b> extension penalties <b>and</b> their respective distribution of phylogeny scores...|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the regular}} season, Boston College was ranked 26th nationally in total defense, and 2nd nationally in run defense. Its pass defense, however, was ranked 106th in the country, and since Boston College was without senior cornerback DeJuan Tribble, who was {{recovering}} from a sprained knee ligament, it was expected that the Eagles' linebackers would have to play a very good game to stop Virginia Tech's passing offense. Jo-Lonn Dunbar, who had been named to the preseason watch list for the Bronko Nagurski Trophy (awarded to the top defensive player in the country) was expected to fill the <b>gaps</b> <b>and</b> stop both rushing and passing elements of Virginia Tech's offense.|$|E

5|$|Battlements {{were most}} often found surmounting curtain {{walls and the}} tops of gatehouses, and {{comprised}} several elements: crenellations, hoardings, machicolations, and loopholes. Crenellation is the collective name for alternating crenels and merlons: <b>gaps</b> <b>and</b> solid blocks {{on top of a}} wall. Hoardings were wooden constructs that projected beyond the wall, allowing defenders to shoot at, or drop objects on, attackers {{at the base of the}} wall without having to lean perilously over the crenellations, thereby exposing themselves to retaliatory fire. Machicolations were stone projections on top of a wall with openings that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the base of the wall in a similar fashion to hoardings.|$|E
5|$|In July 1969 he {{finished}} his last work, a large woodcut with threefold rotational symmetry called Snakes, in which snakes wind through a pattern of linked rings. These shrink to infinity toward both {{the center and the}} edge of a circle. It was exceptionally elaborate, being printed using three blocks, each rotated three times about the center of the image and precisely aligned to avoid <b>gaps</b> <b>and</b> overlaps, for a total of nine print operations for each finished print. The image encapsulates Escher's love of symmetry, of interlocking patterns, {{and at the end of}} his life, of his approach to infinity. The care Escher took in creating and printing this woodcut can be seen in a video recording.|$|E
5|$|By far {{the most}} {{detailed}} and reliable source for the battle, and Julian's Gallic campaign (355–60) generally, is the Res Gestae (Histories) of Ammianus Marcellinus, a contemporary historian. Ammianus was a Greek career soldier who joined the army before 350 and served until at least 363. Enlisted as a protector (cadet senior officer), {{he served as a}} staff officer under magister equitum Ursicinus and then under Julian himself in the latter's Persian campaign. Although he was not present at Strasbourg, he had experience of the Gallic front as he was involved in the suppression of the revolt of Claudius Silvanus, the magister equitum (commander-in-chief) in Gaul (355). However, his narrative reveals a passionate admiration of Julian and occasionally descends to the level of eulogy. Furthermore, as he was writing some 40 years after the event, it is likely that Ammianus relied heavily, if not exclusively, on Julian's own memoir of the Strasbourg campaign (which we know he published, but has been lost). Thus Ammianus' account probably reflects Julian's own propaganda. In addition, Ammianus' account is of uneven quality, with many <b>gaps</b> <b>and</b> some contradictory elements.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} syntax <b>and</b> distribution of <b>Gapping</b> <b>and</b> Fragments, {{as well as}} the movements involved in ellipsis contexts in general.

In the second part it is argued that the licensing condition on ellipsis holds at the discourse component and that, from a discourse perspective, the distribution of <b>Gapping</b> <b>and</b> Fragments is identical. The main claim of this study, then, is that <b>Gapping</b> <b>and</b> Fragments should not be formally distinguished in a theory of ellipsis. The final part of this dissertation is concerned with the movements of the remnant elements of ellipsis.

40|$|New allotropes of {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) <b>GaP</b> <b>and</b> InP binary compounds were predicted {{from the}} structural optimization and dynamical stability {{analysis in the}} framework of the density functional calculations.

5|$|Over Romney Marsh Nos. 41, 92 and 222 Squadrons engaged JG 26, {{losing one}} of their number to the Bf 109s. The second wave of RAF fighters arrived on the scene, {{comprising}} 607 and 213 Squadrons with 23 Hurricanes. They initiated a head-on attack against the Do 17s of KG 3. A Hurricane and a Dornier collided, both going down. The Bf 109s {{did their best to}} break up attacks and the bombers held a tight formation, putting up withering cross-fire. The Bf 109s were not permitted to leave the bombers and chase enemy fighters. Time and again, they were forced to break off and return to the bomber stream, allowing the RAF fighters to return and repeat the process. Soon after, No. 605 and No. 501 Squadron arrived with 14 Hurricanes. One fighter was hit by return fire, but the pilot aimed his aircraft at a Dornier and bailed out. The fighter collided and destroyed the bomber. The German bomber crews {{had no way of knowing}} that the crashes were not premeditated. It seemed as if the British were desperate. Nevertheless, they thought the 'tactic' was devastatingly effective. Chastened by losses, the Dorniers closed ranks to snuff out the <b>gaps</b> <b>and</b> continued to their target.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Canadian Division faced {{difficulties}} at {{the start}} of the battle that forced it to delay its assault on the Pimple until 12 April. The Pimple was initially defended by the 16th Bavarian Infantry Division but the Canadian Corps' preliminary artillery bombardment leading up to the assault on 9 April caused heavy casualties amongst its ranks. On 11 April, the 4th Guards Infantry Division first reinforced and then relieved affected 16th Bavarian Infantry Division units. The night before the attack, artillery harassed German positions while a gas section of Royal Engineers, employing Livens Projectors, fired more than 40 drums of gas directly into the village of Givenchy-en-Gohelle to cause confusion. The defending German troops managed to drive back the initial Canadian assaults at around 4:00am using small arms fire. The 10th Canadian Brigade attacked once again at 5:00am, this time supported by a significant amount of artillery and the 24th British Division of I Corps to the north. The German defensive artillery fire was late and too light to cause the assaulting troops great difficulty, allowing the Canadian Corps to exploit wide <b>gaps</b> <b>and</b> break into the German positions. The 10th Canadian Brigade, assisted by snow and a westerly wind, fought hastily entrained German troops to capture the entire Pimple by 6:00pm.|$|E
5|$|The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is an action-adventure {{video game}} in which players take {{on the role of}} series protagonist Link through a series of overworlds {{populated}} by monsters and navigating dungeons featuring puzzles and further enemies including dedicated bosses. Link is controlled using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, and the Wii MotionPlus expansion device is required to play. The greater majority of gameplay mechanics revolve around use of motion controls: these include camera control with the Nunchuck and general hotkey actions and movement linked to the Wii Remote. Jumping across <b>gaps</b> <b>and</b> scaling ledges happen automatically within context. The Nunchuck is also used to make Link perform a forward roll. In addition to his standard pace, Link can sprint for short distances. Sprinting and other actions such as climbing and carrying heavy objects is limited by a stamina meter, which recharges after a few seconds when not performing actions that drain it. When depleted entirely, Link's movement speed is reduced and he is left vulnerable until the meter refills. Standard navigation takes place from a third-person perspective, while the Dowsing search function switches to a first-person view: Dowsing scans an area for a selected object, with new Dowsing objectives appearing depending on game context.|$|E

40|$|Two {{nationwide}} land-cover mapping efforts, the GAP Analysis Program (<b>GAP)</b> <b>and</b> the USGS National Land Cover Data (NLCD) program, {{address the}} need for intermediate-scale land-cover information to support a diverse user community. The data sets are comparable, but have different objectives, classifica-tion systems, and methodologies. A comparative analysis of the <b>GAP</b> <b>and</b> NLCD data sets is needed throughout the United States to determine their relative strengths and limitations and better inform the user community of their applicability for var-ious applications. This study conducted comparative analyses of the <b>GAP</b> <b>and</b> NLCD data sets for Kansas. The data sets were generalized to {{a common set of}} land-cover classes, and pixel-level comparisons were made at the state and ecoregion levels. The <b>GAP</b> <b>and</b> NLCD had an overall classification agreement of 67 percent at the state level, with most of the classification dis-agreement occurring between cropland and grassland. The cropland area classified by GAP was comparable to cropland area estimates reported by the USDA, while NLCD appeared to underestimate cropland and overestimate grassland. The single-date/multiple-data source classification approach and the sub-optimal early-spring dates of Landsat TM data used to produce NLCD resulted in substantial confusion in cropland-grassland discrimination. The multiple-date classification approach used by Kansas GAP provided better discrimination of most land-cover classes. Some classification disagreement, however, was attributable to methodological differences between <b>GAP</b> <b>and</b> NLCD. Accuracy assessment found an overall accuracy of 87 percent for <b>GAP</b> <b>and</b> 81 percent for NLCD, <b>and</b> <b>GAP</b> had higher accuracies for most individual land-cover classes. The Kansas <b>GAP</b> <b>and</b> NLCD land-cover products were found to be comparable in terms of characterizing broad scale land-cover patterns, but the Kansas GAP land-cover map ap-pears to be more appropriate for localized applications that require detailed and accurate land-cover information...|$|R
5|$|The Lexus LS {{marked the}} first {{successful}} entrant of a Japanese manufacturer into the prestige luxury arena, a market that had long been dominated by established European and American brands. By 1991, with the LS 400 its top-selling model, Lexus had overtaken Mercedes-Benz and BMW in overall U.S. sales, and in 2000, the marque passed Cadillac as the luxury sales leader in the largest automotive market. Rival manufacturers responded with lower prices and added features. In particular, Mercedes-Benz reorganized its operations, shifting to a targeted-cost process similar to Lexus production methods, and dropped competing U.S. base prices by nearly 10 percent. To rival the LS 400, extra features were rushed for {{the launch of the}} 1991 Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W140), causing budget overruns and costing the job of Daimler-Benz's chief engineer, Wolfgang Peter. Approximately 5 percent of 1989 LS 400 sales went to buyers employed by rival manufacturers, including GM, Ford, and Chrysler. When the LS 400 was disassembled for engineering analysis, Cadillac engineers concluded that the vehicle could not be built using existing GM methods. Industry publications noted the LS 400's precise panel <b>gaps,</b> <b>and</b> the subject became a common evaluation standard in road tests. The LS 430's interior noise level was later used by rival makes as a measure of cabin quiet.|$|E
5|$|Webs are {{typically}} established in low-growing dune plants and other vegetation {{such as the}} native Pingao (Desmoschoenus spiralis) or the introduced marram grass (Ammophila arenaria). They may also build their webs under driftwood, stones, or other debris such as empty tin cans or bottles. Webs are almost always constructed over open sand and near the ground so as to catch crawling insects for food. Spiders inhabiting dune grasses construct their webs in open spaces between the grass tufts, while spiders inhabiting areas of shrubbery do so {{on the underside of}} a plant overhanging open sand. It has been found that these patches of open sand are necessary for katipo to build their webs as plants that envelop sand dunes in dense cover, such as exotic plants like kikuyu or buffalo grass, create an environment unsuitable for web construction. The katipo therefore prefers to spin its web amongst pingao plants as this plants growth pattern leaves patches of sand between each plant. The wind can then blow insects and other prey through these <b>gaps</b> <b>and</b> into the web. Marram grass has been extensively planted in New Zealand to help stabilise sand dunes and has largely replaced pingao in many areas. Because marram grass grows in a very tight formation only leaving small gaps between tuffs, this makes it difficult for the katipo to construct a suitable web for capturing prey.|$|E
