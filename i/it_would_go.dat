5|$|Attack of the Saiyans was {{generally}} well received by gaming critics, complimenting the battle system, its visuals, {{and its ability}} to stay true to the series. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> on to be the third-best selling video game during the month of May 2009 in Japan.|$|E
5|$|A {{railroad}} {{was being}} built {{and the population}} of Quorn hoped that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> through the village {{on its way to}} Sioux City, Iowa. However, the railroad did not go through Quorn. One of the many ideas about why the railroad took a different route was due to a disagreement between the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company and the Close brothers. The actual reason is still unknown. Due to the railroad being the main mode of transportation of goods, the villagers {{had no choice but to}} relocate to a new area. Every business except for a mill was moved to a new area during 1883.|$|E
5|$|Unbeknownst to Wall Street, a new {{crisis was}} being averted in the background. On Sunday, Morgan's associate, George Perkins, was {{informed}} that the City of New York required at least $20 million by November 1 or <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> bankrupt. The city tried to raise money through a standard bond issue, but failed to gather enough financing. On Monday and again on Tuesday, New York Mayor George McClellan approached Morgan for assistance. In an effort to avoid the disastrous signal that a New York City bankruptcy would send, Morgan contracted to purchase $30 million worth of city bonds.|$|E

25|$|It is {{fortunate}} that the urea conversion reaction is slow—because {{if it were}} not <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> into reverse in the stripper. As it is, succeeding stages of the process must be designed to minimize residence times, at least until the temperature reduces {{to the point where the}} reversion reaction is very slow.|$|E
25|$|During this time, {{the play}} Lightnin', by Winchell Smith and Frank Bacon, {{became the first}} Broadway show to reach 700 performances. From then, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> {{on to become the}} first show to reach 1,000 performances. Lightnin was the longest-running Broadway show until being {{overtaken}} in performance totals by Abie's Irish Rose in 1925.|$|E

25|$|The album debuted {{at number}} eight on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 63,000 copies {{in its first}} week. Upon its release, Wake Up! {{received}} positive reviews from most music critics, who complimented its production and the artists' treatment and performance of the material. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> {{on to win the}} 2010 Grammy Award for Best R Album.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> {{on to win}} the Janet Heidiger Kafka Prize {{for best}} first novel. Ninety {{thousand}} copies were sold in hardback; Robert Redford, who would eventually direct the film, acquired the rights before publication (actually traveling to Guest's suburban Minnesota home to do so). Since 1976, half a million copies of the paperback have been sold.|$|E
25|$|The {{film was}} a box office flop, {{receiving}} many negative to mixed reviews from critics(see below). The film {{was released in}} theaters on September 23, 1983 and grossed $1.4 million on its opening weekend. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> on to make a paltry $4.7 million in North America. The film was pulled from theaters after three weeks {{and all of the}} promotional ads pulled after one week.|$|E

25|$|After {{a three-month}} public {{submission}} period that ended on 4 February 2005, the Reserve Bank announced on 31 March <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> {{ahead with the}} proposed changes. The changeover period started on 31 July 2006, with the old coins usable up until 31 October 2006. The older 50, 20, 10 and 5c pieces are no longer legal tender, but are still redeemable at the Reserve Bank.|$|E
25|$|The Beuren chapel was consecrated to Saint Anthony, thus {{meaning that}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> {{back to the}} 12th century at the earliest. In the chapel in pre-Reformation times {{was a picture of}} the saint, which is {{likewise}} witnessed as the object of pilgrimages. Of the chapel, only the tower still stands today, for the nave was torn down about 1950, supposedly because it was falling into disrepair.|$|E
25|$|Marie Antoinette was {{instrumental}} in the reinstatement of Jacques Necker as Finance Minister on 26 August, a popular move, even though she herself was worried that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> against her if Necker proved unsuccessful in reforming the country's finances. She accepted Necker's proposition to double the representation of the Third Estate (tiers état) in an attempt to check the power of the aristocracy.|$|E

25|$|Hardware {{expansion}} boards {{could use}} any of the upper memory area for ROM addressing, so the upper memory blocks were of variable size and in different locations for each computer, depending on the hardware installed. Some windows of upper memory could be large and others small. Loading drivers and TSRs high would pick a block and try to fit the program into it, until a block was found where it fit, or <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> into conventional memory.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2014, SpaceX {{capabilities}} and pricing had {{also begun to}} affect the market for launch of US military payloads. For nearly a decade the large US launch provider United Launch Alliance (ULA) had faced no competition for military launches. Anticipating a slump in domestic military and spy launches, ULA stated that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> out of business unless it won commercial satellite launch orders. To that end, ULA announced a major restructuring of processes and workforce in order to decrease launch costs by half.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s other {{countries}} {{would follow the}} Americans lead and begin to develop 5.56×45mm assault rifles, most notably Germany with the Heckler & Koch HK33. The HK33 was essentially a smaller 5.56mm version of the 7.62×51mm Heckler & Koch G3 rifle. As {{one of the first}} 5.56mm assault rifles on the market, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> on {{to become one of the}} most widely distributed assault rifles. The HK33 featured a modular design with a wide range of accessories (telescoping butt-stocks, optics, bi-pods, etc.) that could be easily removed and arranged in a variety configurations.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a legend}} {{that takes place}} in the time of Nabeshima Mitsushige, the second daimyo of the Saga Domain, Hizen Province, {{concerning}} the bakeneko. Mitsushige's retainer Ryūzōji Matashichirō served as the daimyos opponent in the game of go. Ryūzōji displeased Mitsushige and was put to the sword. Ryūzōji's mother, while telling of the sorrows in her heart to the cat that she raised, committed suicide. The cat licked the mother's blood and became a bakeneko. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> into the castle and torment Mitsushige every night. Mitsushige's loyal retainer Komori Hanzaemon finally killed it and saved the Nabeshima family.|$|E
25|$|Preliminary {{hearings}} {{in the prosecution}} of 59 men suspected of {{taking part in the}} attack began in October 2007, but the trial was then delayed {{for more than a year}} as court officials sought to find a team of jurors. Between October 2007 and November 2008, an estimated 1,200 citizens were summoned as potential members of the jury. However, more than 500 never appeared in court, and all but 13 of the remainder asked to be excused. In February 2009, the court finally abandoned the idea of a jury trial, deciding <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> ahead with three presiding judges instead.|$|E
25|$|In the Senate {{fight in}} 1919 over American {{membership}} in the League of Nations, Root supported Lodge's proposal of membership with certain reservations that allowed the United States government {{to decide whether or}} not <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> to war. The US never joined, but Root supported the League of Nations and served on the commission of jurists, which created the Permanent Court of International Justice. In 1922, when Root was 77, President Warren G. Harding appointed him as a delegate of an American team headed by Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes. They participated in the Washington Naval Conference (International Conference on the Limitation of Armaments).|$|E
