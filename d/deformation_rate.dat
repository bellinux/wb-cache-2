This study investigated <b>deformations</b> and <b>deformation</b> <b>rates</b> in the sternocleidomastoid (SCM), longus capitis (Lcap), and longus colli (Lco) muscles with real-time ultrasonography. Twenty-six individuals with WAD were compared with 26 controls, matched for age and sex. Ultrasound imaging of the SCM, Lcap, and Lco were recorded during 10 repetitive arm elevations.

There were few {{significant differences in the}} <b>deformations</b> or <b>deformation</b> <b>rates</b> in the SCM, Lcap, and Lco between the WAD and control group. In controls, <b>deformations</b> and <b>deformation</b> <b>rates</b> showed linear positive relationships between SCM/Lcap, SCM/Lco, and Lcap/Lco which increased from the first arm elevation (R(2)  =  0. 14 - 0. 70); to the tenth arm elevation (R(2)  =  0. 51 - 0. 71). The WAD group showed similar or weaker linear relationship (R(2)  <  0. 19) during the tenth compared to the first (R(2)  <  0. 44) arm elevation except for deformations in Lcap/Lco (R(2)  =  0. 13 - 0. 57).

The criterion yields maximum values of M which compare well with critical values of M for the onset of elastic instabilities in viscometric torsional flows.

40|$|Particle {{rotations}} {{can have}} a dominant influence {{on the behavior of}} granular materials, particularly in materials with circular or spherical particles. The paper briefly reviews experimental evidence of the magnitude and variability of particle rotations and their effect on a granular material’s stiffness and strength. Evidence of rotational patterning is reported from DEM simulations of a large square assembly of multi-sized circular particles. The translational velocities of the particles were used to compute the rotation and <b>deformation</b> <b>rates</b> within small polygonal regions of material. The material rotation could then be compared with the rotations of the particles themselves. Two meso-scale phenomena are described in the paper: rotating clusters and rotation chains. During biaxial tests, the local <b>deformation</b> <b>rates</b> are highly variable, with banded regions having <b>deformation</b> <b>rates</b> much greater than the mean rate, and with clustered regions in which very little deformation occurs. Material within a nearly-rigid region usually rotates in either an entirely clockwise or entirely counter-clockwise manner. The direction of this material rotation matches the direction of particle rotations in these regions. In a second rotational pattern, the most rapidly rotating particles are aligned in chain-like patterns oblique to the principal stress directions. These rotation chains are usually located within intensely deforming band-like regions...|$|R
5000|$|LDPE and LLDPE have unique {{rheological}} or {{melt flow}} properties. LLDPE is less shear sensitive {{because of its}} narrower molecular weight distribution and shorter chain branching. During a shearing process, such as extrusion, LLDPE remains more viscous and, therefore, harder to process than an LDPE of equivalent melt index. The lower shear sensitivity of LLDPE allows for a faster stress relaxation of the polymer chains during extrusion, and, therefore, the physical properties are susceptible to changes in blow-up ratios. In melt extension, LLDPE has lower viscosity at all strain rates. This means it will not strain harden the way LDPE does when elongated. As the <b>deformation</b> <b>rate</b> of the polyethylene increases, LDPE demonstrates a dramatic rise in viscosity because of chain entanglement. This phenomenon is not observed with LLDPE {{because of the lack}} of long-chain branching in LLDPE allows the chains to slide by one another upon elongation without becoming entangled. This characteristic is important for film applications because LLDPE films can be downgauged easily while maintaining high strength and toughness. The rheological properties of LLDPE are summarized as [...] "stiff in shear" [...] and [...] "soft in extension". It is not taken in most curbside pickups in communities. LLDPE can be recycled though into other things like trash can liners, lumber, landscaping ties, floor tiles, compost bins, and shipping envelopes ...|$|E

The deformation pattern of Central Taiwan generally forms a half-elliptical pattern, with the eastern half of the elliptical shape cut away by the north-south trending Chelungpu fault. Along a selected profile of 10 km near the Chelungpu Fault of Central Taiwan, the differential range change was measured and recalculated into deformation rates. The year-to-year deformation rates near the Chi-Chi earthquake ranged between 1.5 and 3 cm/year in most years except for the years between 1999 and 2000, which showed more than 5 cm/year deformation rates along the profile. Prior to the high <b>deformation</b> <b>rate</b> shown during the coseismic image pair, the <b>deformation</b> <b>rate</b> was low, as shown on the other image pairs.

In this study, 16 ascending images from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) and 18 descending images from the Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT) have been integrated to characterize and to detect the slow-moving landslides in Zhouqu, China between 2008 and 2010.
