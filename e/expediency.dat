25|$|Life {{expectancy}} is {{also likely}} to be affected by exposure to high levels of highway air pollution or industrial air pollution. This is one way that occupation can have a major effect on life expectancy. Coal miners (and in prior generations, asbestos cutters) often have lower life <b>expediencies</b> than average life <b>expediencies.</b> Other factors affecting an individual's life expectancy are genetic disorders, drug use, tobacco smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, access to health care, diet and exercise.|$|R
50|$|The United States {{maintained}} its Constitutional Republic government structure throughout World War II.

Still, elections were held as scheduled in 1944.|$|R
60|$|The line {{taken up}} by the press and the {{governing}} classes of England during the American Civil War may serve to illustrate the kind of mood which we conceive to be gaining firmer hold than ever of the national mind. Those who sympathised with the Southern States listened only to political arguments, and very narrow and inefficient political arguments, as it happened, when they ought to have seen that here was an issue which involved not only political ideas, but moral and religious ideas as well. That is to say, the ordinary political tests were not enough to reveal the entire significance of the crisis, nor were the political standards proper for measuring the whole of the <b>expediencies</b> hanging in the balance. The conflict could not be adequately gauged by such questions as whether the Slave States had or had not a constitutional right to establish an independent government; whether the Free States were animated by philanthropy or by love of empire; whether it was to the political advantage of England that the American Union should be divided and consequently weakened. Such questions were not necessarily improper in themselves, and we can imagine circumstances in which they might be not only proper but decisive. But, the circumstances being what they were, the narrower <b>expediencies</b> of ordinary politics were outweighed by one of those supreme and indefeasible <b>expediencies</b> which are classified as moral. These are, in other words, the higher, wider, more binding, and transcendent part of the master art of social wellbeing.|$|R
5|$|Although {{ultimate}} power officially rested {{with the}} country's {{government in the}} form of Sovnarkom and the Executive Committee (VTSIK) elected by the All-Russian Congress of Soviets (ARCS), the Communist Party was de facto in control in Russia, as acknowledged by its members at the time. By 1918, Sovnarkom began acting unilaterally, claiming a need for <b>expediency,</b> with the ARCS and VTSIK becoming increasingly marginalised, so the soviets no longer had a role in governing Russia. During 1918 and 1919, the government expelled Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries from the soviets. Russia had become a one-party state.|$|E
5|$|Christians at {{the time}} of Constantine's {{conversion}} made up only 10% of the population. This would rise to 50% {{by the end of the}} fourth century and 90% by the end of the fifth century. Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565) then brutally mopped up the rest of the pagans, highly literate academics on one end of the scale and illiterate peasants on the other. A conversion so rapid seems to have been rather the result of <b>expediency</b> than of conviction.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Iran's {{head of the}} <b>Expediency</b> Council, Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani, {{criticized the}} {{government}} for failing to reinvest the money it saved by restructuring government subsidies. To compensate, the government says it has allowed producers to adjust their prices more liberally and it has given free loans and energy subsidies in some cases. In recent years, income inequality in Iran has declined by different measures, which may be an effect of the subsidy reforms. For example, the income Gini coefficient fell from 0.4023 in 2005 to 0.3813 in 2010. Between February 2011 and February 2012, the government earned 510 trillion rials (some $41.6 billion) by implementing the Subsidy Reform Plan.|$|E

40|$|The whyness of commandments and the {{philosophy}} of legislation in Islam is a significant issue which has always been debated by the scholars of the sects (al-sonnis and al-shias). All Islamic sects have accepted the reliance of commandments (al-ahkam) on <b>expediencies</b> and depravities. Contemplating on Quranic verses, traditions (al-sonnah) and actions of jurisprudents from the past until now, we can conclude {{that there is a}} close relationship between intentions of canonical law and the terms 'expediency' and 'depravity'. Through investigating the theory of intentions and its relationship with <b>expediencies</b> and depravities, the present paper attempts to deal with one of the significant issues which can {{play a vital role in}} removing the doubts and resolving the problems, particularly in cases of silence of law, and also can emphasize and confirm the comprehensiveness of canonical law. Nowadays, one of the big challenges is to find a strategy for the correspondence of jurisprudence with the surrounding world's considerable developments. A significant strategy for such a correspondence seems to be comprehensive legal theorization (ijtehad-e-jameh), taking account of the objectives of the religion and intentions of canonical law...|$|R
50|$|Also {{responding}} to a growing mandate that poetry and literature be committed to the immediate political needs of the Arab nation and the masses, Adonis and Shi‘r energetically opposed the recruitment of poets and writers into propagandist efforts. In rejecting Adab al-iltizam (politically committed literature), Adonis was opposing {{the suppression of the}} individual’s imagination and voice for the needs of the group. Poetry, he argued, must remain a realm in which language and ideas are examined, reshaped, and reﬁned, in which the poet refuses to descend to the level of daily <b>expediencies.</b>|$|R
5|$|Though {{the writing}} of vachana poems went into decline after {{the passing of the}} Basavanna era in the late 12th century, latter day vachanakaras such as Tontada Siddhesavara (or Siddhalinga Yati), a noted Shaiva saint and guru of King Virupaksha RayaII, started a revival. He wrote Shatsthala Jnanamrita (1540), a {{collection}} of 700 poems. In 1560, Virakta Tontadarya made the life of Tontada Siddhesavara the central theme in his writing Siddhesvara Purana. Virakta Tontadarya, Gummalapura Siddhalinga, Swatantra Siddhalingeshwara (1560) and Ghanalingideva (1560) are some well-known vachana poets who tried to recreate the glory days of the early poets, though the socio-political <b>expediency</b> did not exist.|$|E
5|$|After {{considerable}} argument, {{the decision}} to proceed ultimately fell to an unlikely political <b>expediency.</b> At the time, the UK was pressing for admission to the European Common Market, which was being controlled by Charles de Gaulle who felt the UK's Special Relationship with the US made them unacceptable in a pan-European group. Cabinet felt that signing a deal with Sud would {{pave the way for}} Common Market entry, and this became the main deciding reason for moving ahead with the deal. It was this belief that had led the original STAC documents being leaked to the French. However, De Gaulle spoke of the European origin of the design, and continued to block the UK's entry into the Common Market.|$|E

Meanwhile, Marius realizes that the band of barbarians he encountered years ago had invaded Rome and slain his father at Nero's instigation {{as a means of}} eliminating a political rival. Furthermore, the Celts, led by a just-escaped Boudica, lay siege to York, with XIV Legion tasked with defending it until Commodus can escape. In the end, Marius sacrifices himself to buy time for the final ships to sail, but is resurrected by the goddess Summer, who tasks him with taking on the mantle of Damocles, a legendary Roman general who was abandoned to his enemies for political <b>expediency.</b> In that guise, Summer tells him to avenge his family and comrades, and save Rome.|$|E

A definitive series of 1948 featured a variety of local scenery, while a 1951 series of 24 stamps depicted fish in full color. A 1953 series showed butterflies and moths, while the 1961 series included the coat of arms of various Mozambique cities.

5|$|In {{clear and}} {{forceful}} language Floyd reasserted the state sovereignty theory of government, as {{guaranteed by the}} 'Compact or Constitution,' holding the Federal Government to be merely the 'Agent of the States' entrusted only with such powers as were originally intended to operate 'externally' and 'upon nations foreign to those composing the Confederacy.' He {{called attention to the}} disregard with which 'an unrestrained majority' had received the memorials and protests of some of the 'sovereign states,' justifying their acts by precedent and <b>expediency</b> and thus melting away 'the solder of the Federal chain;' also {{to the fact that it}} was then 'strongly insinuated' that the states could not 'interpose to arrest an unconstitutional measure.' Such a course, he was certain, could result only in nullifying the federal constitution and in a complete failure in our experiment in government.|$|E
5|$|In {{reality the}} House of Hohenzollern, of which Albrecht was a member, the ruling {{family of the}} Margraviate of Brandenburg, had been {{actively}} expanding its territorial influence; for example already in the 16th century in Farther Pomerania and Silesia. Motivated by a current political <b>expediency,</b> Sigismund Augustus in 1563 allowed the Brandenburg elector branch of the Hohenzollerns, excluded under the 1525 agreement, to inherit the Prussian fief rule. The decision, confirmed by the 1569 sejm, made the future union of Prussia with Brandenburg possible. Sigismind II, unlike his successors, was however careful to assert his supremacy. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, ruled after 1572 by elective kings, was even less able to counteract the growing importance of the dynastically active Hohenzollerns.|$|E
5|$|By {{executive}} order, Bevin required {{all state}} agencies to reduce spending {{in their current}} budgets by 4.5 percent. House Speaker Greg Stumbo argued that Bevin {{did not have the}} authority to order such reductions without legislative approval, but Senate President Robert Stivers defended Bevin's action, saying it amounted to simply not spending money that was previously allocated. Bevin later compromised with the state's public college and university presidents to reduce the cuts to 2 percent, but Attorney General Andy Beshear sued to stop the cuts entirely. On May 18, 2016, a Franklin Circuit Court judge ruled Bevin did have the authority to make the cuts. The Kentucky Supreme Court accepted the case on appeal, granting Beshear's request to bypass the Kentucky Court of Appeals for <b>expediency.</b> A hearing before the Supreme Court occurred on August 18. On September 21, 2016, the Supreme Court issued a 5–2 decision reversing the Franklin Circuit Court ruling and agreeing with Beshear that Bevin did not have the authority to make mid-year budget cuts without the approval of the General Assembly.|$|E

30|$|Regarding the {{friction}} between Bengali and English, there is renewed need {{to push for}} ‘universal literacy’ (see Imam, p. 482) in both languages, rather than compromising any one for the other.

Phillipson's ([2009]) proposal for education policies to embrace ‘multilingual aims and means’ building on local resources and opening up spaces to allow a new ‘attitude’ Seidlhofer ([2004]) will enable the establishment of its national identity (p. 49) more firmly.

5|$|On 2 January an {{emergency}} meeting {{was held at}} the Independence Palace in Saigon between President Thiệu, the Joint General Staff, and General Dong. At the meeting, Dong presented a plan for the relief of Phước Long that would have utilized either an infantry division or the Airborne Division. The plan was turned down for three reasons: first, there were simply no reserve forces of sufficient size available anywhere in the country for the task; second, with all overland routes in enemy hands, all movements and logistics would have to depend entirely on airlift, a capability that no longer existed; and third, despite advantageous defensive positions, the forces at Phước Long could not hold off two communist divisions long enough for any relief effort to succeed. The decision was then reached. Phước Long City and province would be surrendered to North Vietnamese forces as a matter of <b>expediency,</b> since it was considered to be strategically less important than Tây Ninh, Pleiku, or Huế – economically, politically, and demographically.|$|E
5|$|The nearly {{decade and}} a half of wars greatly {{weakened}} the Spanish American economies and political institutions, which hindered the region's potential economic development for most of the nineteenth century and resulted in the enduring instability the region experienced. Independence destroyed the de facto trade bloc that was the Spanish Empire - Manila galleons and Spanish treasure fleets in particular. After independence, trade among the new Spanish American nations was less {{than it had been in}} the colonial period. Once the ties were broken, the small populations of most of the new nations provided little incentive to entice Spanish American producers to recreate the old trade patterns. In addition, the protection against European competition, which the Spanish monopoly had provided to the manufacturing sectors of the economy, ended. Due to <b>expediency,</b> protective tariffs for these sectors, in particular textile production, were permanently dropped and foreign imports beat out local production. This greatly affected Native communities, which in many parts of Spanish America, specialized in supplying finished products to the urban markets, albeit using pre-industrial techniques. The wars also greatly affected the principal economic sector of the region, mining. Silver production in Bolivia halved after independence and it dropped by three quarters in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|At Fort Belvedere, on 10 December, Edward {{signed his}} written abdication notices, {{witnessed}} by his three younger brothers: Prince Albert, Duke of York (who succeeded Edward as George VI); Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester; and Prince George, Duke of Kent.

Under changes introduced in 1931 by the Statute of Westminster, a single Crown for the entire empire {{had been replaced by}} multiple crowns, one for each Dominion, worn by a single monarch in an organisation then known as the British Commonwealth. Though the British government, hoping for <b>expediency</b> and to avoid embarrassment, wished the Dominions to accept the actions of the home government, the Dominions held that Edward's abdication required the consent of each Commonwealth state. This was duly given; by the Parliament of Australia, which was at the time in session, and by the governments of the other Dominions, whose parliaments were in recess. The government of the Irish Free State, taking the opportunity presented by the crisis and in a major step towards its eventual transition to a republic, passed an amendment to its constitution on 11 December to remove references to the Crown. The King's abdication was recognised a day later in the External Relations Act of the Irish Free State and legislation eventually passed in South Africa declared that the abdication took effect there on 10 December. As Edward VIII had not been crowned, his planned coronation date became that of George VI instead.|$|E
40|$|The current post-historical {{era that}} we live in has {{transformed}} the transmission of national heritage into a pejorative term, due to humanity‘s commitment to a vague conception of democracy without any specific content and a vast number of subjective rights of uncertain efficacy.

40|$|Neglected by {{traditional}} literary histories or misrepresented in gender-specific criticism, Eliza Haywood is properly a novelist whose innovations {{can be seen}} in the works of Defoe and Richardson. This thesis examines selected novels by the London-based Haywood (1693 ?- 1756) in light of their contributions to the novel form. It begins by considering her romance novellas as adaptations of the popular scandal novels of Delariviere Manley. Haywood's early fiction combines the concerns of amatory fiction with the political <b>expediencies</b> of satire. Over the course of her career, Haywood's early romance novellas expanded to become conduct novels. In their endorsement of a prudent conjugal happiness over erotic fulfilment, her later works exemplify the changing proprieties at the heart of the eighteenth-century British novel. The argument of this thesis is the contention that Haywood's prose fiction provides a fresh and significant perspective upon a pivotal period in eighteenth-century British fiction...|$|R
