5|$|Although characterised at {{the time}} and since as actions against piracy, this charge has been disputed by historians and archivists in the UAE in particular, notably the current Ruler of Sharjah, HH Dr Sheikh Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi in his book 'The Myth of Arabian Piracy in the Gulf'. The {{counter-argument}} is that the Al Qasimi, a strong and independent maritime force, were the subject of British aggression in an attempt to stamp <b>its</b> <b>authority</b> - and that of its Omani allies - on trade routes thought of as important to Iraq and India.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Albanian {{independence}} movement gathered momentum. On 28 November 1912 in Vlorë, Ismail Qemali declared Albania's independence, and a provisional government was soon formed that exercised <b>its</b> <b>authority</b> {{only in the}} immediate area of Vlorë. Elsewhere, the Ottoman general Essad Pasha formed the Republic of Central Albania at Durrës, while conservative Albanian tribesmen still hoped for an Ottoman ruler. Most of the area that would form the Albanian state was occupied at this time, by the Greeks {{in the south and}} the Serbs in the north.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the endemic {{internal}} power struggles, the TFG has faced {{far more serious}} problems in establishing <b>its</b> <b>authority</b> and rebuilding the structures of governance.

There are no properly functioning government institutions.|$|E

5|$|Lara {{appealed the}} denial of his motion to dismiss to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that the Tribal Court {{obtained}} <b>its</b> <b>authority</b> from the ICRA, an act of Congress, and that both the Tribal Court and the Federal Court derived their power from the same sovereign. A three-judge panel of the Circuit Court affirmed {{the decision of the}} District Court, holding that the tribe derived its power from its own retained sovereignty that was separate from the sovereignty of the United States. The Eighth Circuit's panel noted that in the Duro decision, the Supreme Court had observed that Congress could address the jurisdictional system, which Congress did. When Congress amended the ICRA, they were addressing a federal common law issue, not a constitutional issue, and were within their authority to recognize the sovereignty of the tribes. The panel then affirmed the trial court on the Petite claim. Judge Hansen dissented, believing that the tribe drew <b>its</b> <b>authority</b> to try Lara from the federal government.|$|E
5|$|The {{document}} was then {{deposited in the}} temple that housed the Treasury (the aerarium). While a senatus auctoritas (vetoed Senate motion) had no legal value, it did serve to show {{the opinion of the}} Senate.

5|$|This Court, {{limited in}} {{function}} {{in accordance with}} that premise, does not serve its high purpose when it exceeds <b>its</b> <b>authority,</b> even to satisfy justified impatience with the slow workings of the political process.

5|$|By {{the close}} of the 19th century, Madagascar was largely {{under the control of the}} Kingdom of Imerina, with its royal palaces at its capital in Antananarivo. Although the kingdom had existed since the early 16th century, it {{expanded}} its control beyond its traditional borders in the 1820s under King Radama I, who the British government officially recognized as the sovereign over the entire island of Madagascar. After several failed attempts to impose <b>its</b> <b>authority</b> over the island, France used military force to capture the royal palace in September 1894 and exiled Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony upon officially colonizing the island in February 1895. Queen Ranavalona III was allowed to remain as a figurehead until the emergence of a popular uprising, termed the Menalamba rebellion, for which the queen was held responsible. The rebellion was harshly crushed and the queen was exiled in 1897.|$|E

5|$|From 1669, Klis Fortress {{was in the}} {{possession}} of the Venetians, and it remained so until the fall of the Venetian state. The Venetians restored and enlarged the fortress during their rule. After another, the seventh war with the Turks from 1714 to 1718, the Venetians were able to advance up to the present Bosnian/Croatian border, taking in the whole Sinjsko field and Imotski. Thereafter the Turkish menace was laid to rest and Venice had no serious challenge to <b>its</b> <b>authority</b> in Dalmatia, until Napoleon extinguished the republic itself in 1797. The border between Christian and Muslim Europe had been moved further east, and the fortress lost its main strategic importance. Subsequently, Klis was taken by the Austrians. The last military occupation of Klis Fortress was by Axis powers during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Governors {{first began}} to assert their own power during the American Civil War as the General Assembly {{attempted}} to remove command of the militia from the governor. In response, the General Assembly was effectively suppressed, during which time the governor assumed many powers to appoint public officials, hire and remove state employees, and manage state finances. When the General Assembly reconvened with a majority sympathetic to the governor, he was permitted to continue many of his assumed powers. In 1889, the General Assembly began to reassert <b>its</b> <b>authority</b> over hiring state employees. The issued ended when the Supreme Court {{ruled in favor of}} the legislature, again returning to it final authority over hiring state employees. The legislature passed acts in 1895 that removed the last of the governor's authority to appoint anyone to executive positions.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), an Islamist organization, assumed {{control of}} much of the {{southern}} part of the country and promptly imposed Shari'a law.

On 8 January 2007, as the Battle of Ras Kamboni raged, TFG President and founder Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, a former colonel in the Somali Army, entered Mogadishu for the first time since being elected to office. The government then relocated to Villa Somalia in Mogadishu from its interim location in Baidoa, marking the first time since the fall of the Barre regime in 1991 that the federal government controlled most of the country.|$|E

Patton went on to a lopsided victory in the general election, winning 514,023votes to Goss's 250,857.|$|E
5|$|Lara then {{requested}} a rehearing en banc {{by the full}} court. The request was granted, and the full court reversed {{the decision of the}} three-judge panel, ordering that the federal indictment be dismissed on the grounds of double jeopardy. While the court noted that the Fifth Amendment allowed prosecution by two separate sovereigns, such as the federal government and a state government, it found that an Indian tribe derived <b>its</b> <b>authority</b> to prosecute offenders from the ICRA, which was federal law. The court noted that in previous Supreme Court rulings, the determination of tribal jurisdiction was based on the tribal membership of the individual, not on his race as an Indian. This meant that double jeopardy attached. The United States then appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to hear the case.|$|E
