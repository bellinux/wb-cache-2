[...] "Went straight through in four years", he explained to Under the Radar in 2003. [...] "I guess it proved to myself that I could do something I really didn't want to for four years.

Plus, the whole reason <b>I</b> <b>applied</b> in the first place was because of my girlfriend, and I had gotten accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day." [...] After he graduated, he [...] "worked in a bakery back in Portland with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and legal theory".|$|E

[...] In response Hitchens stood by his standpoint on the deposition he made to prosecutors regarding Sidney Blumenthal during the impeachment of Bill Clinton and his critical review of Edward Said's book Orientalism (1978). He stated that the review was determined by the 25th anniversary of the book's original publication and not by the state of Said's health. On Cindy Sheehan, Hitchens backtracked [...] "On consideration, I would take back the word 'LaRouchie', which <b>I</b> <b>applied</b> not to her but to the words she said she didn't utter (but did)."

2500|$|In 1901, Blue Horse {{attended}} the Pan-American Exposition, a World’s Fair held in Buffalo, New York, from May 1 through November 2, 1901. Blue Horse {{was one of}} the major leaders of Colonel Fred T. Cummins Indian Congress and Wild West Show. Dr. N.W. Wilson, the health officer for the exposition, reported an incident involving [...] Blue Horse and his wife, Council Fire Woman. “One day I found myself suddenly famous among the Indians as a wonder worker fit in rank with the best of their medicine men. The squaw of Blue Horse tumbled over in a faint one afternoon and she was carried into her tepee. The Indians said she was dead. <b>I</b> <b>applied</b> restoratives and in a little while she was alright. Now Blue Horse is a big civil chief in the Sioux Nation, and his wife is of some consequence in Sioux society. So when the Indians saw her come back to life after apparent death, they gave me credit for having worked a miracle. Blue Horse himself believed it and circulated the story.” Blue Horse was so grateful that Dr. Wilson was conferred an honorary degree of medicine man and given the name of “He-Wakes-Them-Up” in a great ceremony at the council house.|$|E
