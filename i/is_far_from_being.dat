5|$|If Malcolm {{exercised}} {{control over}} Moray, which <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> generally accepted, then the annals record {{a number of}} events pointing to a struggle for power in the north. In 1020, Mac Bethad's father Findláech mac Ruaidrí was killed by the sons of his brother Máel Brigte. It seems that Máel Coluim mac Máil Brigti took control of Moray, for his death is reported in 1029.|$|E
5|$|But Beyoncé <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> all sentiment. Because a {{large part}} of being Beyoncé in America in 2013 is being a sexual {{creature}} and not only being unafraid of that fact, but reveling— and reveling confidently— in it. The amorphous, shifting Houston-trap-meets-Noah Shebib trunk rattler 'Partition' exemplifies this particular sentiment. On the track, the Queen Bey tells her driver to put the partition up because 'I don’t need you seeing 'Yoncé on her knees'; uses Monica Lewinsky as a euphemism for her man finishing on her clothing; reveals that 'he like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty'; and repeats that it took her '45 minutes to get all dressed up / and we ain’t even gonna make it to this club'. And in maybe the wildest moment in an album full of bold moves, Beyoncé actually slips in the French translation of Julianne Moore's 'Feminists love sex' monologue from The Big Lebowski.|$|E

The exception here are slaves, whose human capital can be sold, though the slave does not earn an income himself.|$|E

25|$|However, breath {{sampling}} <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> {{a standardized}} procedure {{due to the}} numerous confounding factors biasing the concentrations of volatiles in breath. These factors are related to both the breath sampling protocols {{as well as the}} complex physiological mechanisms underlying pulmonary gas exchange. Even under resting conditions exhaled breath concentrations of VOCs can strongly be influenced by specific physiological parameters such as cardiac output and breathing patterns, depending on the physico-chemical properties of the compound under study.|$|E

On 12 July 2007 the Financial Times (London) reported that the chemical signature of water vapour was detected in the atmosphere of this planet. Although HD 189733b with atmospheric temperatures rising above 1,000°C <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> habitable, this finding increases the likelihood that water, an essential component of life, would be found on a more Earth-like planet in the future.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominant}} females (queens) are {{the principal}} egg layers, while the subordinate females ("auxiliaries") primarily forage and do not lay eggs. This hierarchy is not permanent, though; when the queen (alpha-female) {{is removed from the}} nest, the second-most dominant female (beta-female) displaces the role of the previous queen. Dominance in females is determined by the severity of the scatteredness in the coloration of the clypeus (face), whereas dominance in males is shown by the variation of spots of their abdomens. P. dominula <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> extinct or even being in danger due to their exceptional survival features such as productive colony cycle, short development time, and higher ability to endure predator attacks.|$|E

25|$|Earlier Chinese {{missiles}} of such capability {{from before}} the 1990s include the C-301 (also known as HY-3). With its four ramjet engines, it has a range of 130km and a speed greater than Mach 2.5. Though a success, the missile <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> as potent as the SS-N-22, mainly because it can fly only at a higher cruise altitude of 50 m, rather than cruising at wave tops (such as the 20 m cruise altitude of SS-N-22), so {{it is easier to}} intercept in comparison to SS-N-22. the PLAN's air force has also purchased both the KH31 ramjet supersonic missile and the AS-20 turbojet subsonic anti-ship missile from Russia to arm its fighters.|$|E
25|$|A female {{landowner}} at whose estate most of {{the events}} of the novel happen. She is the widow of a privy councillor, “a wealthy and distinguished lady”. While she is not very influential in St Petersburg, let alone Europe, she is notorious in Moscow society as “a rather eccentric woman, not wholly good-natured, but excessively clever.” She is also described as a beauty in her youth, but “not a trace of her former charms remained.” She shuns the society of local female landowners, but receives many men. Rudin at first gains her favour, but she is very displeased when she finds out about Rudin’s and Natasha’s love. That said, her opinion of Natasha <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> correct.|$|E
25|$|Gaza strip In all 25 {{municipalities}} in the Gaza strip, water {{provision is}} the responsibility of the Coastal Municipalities Water Utility (CMWU). However, the utility is still in the process of being set up and exercise its legal tasks. The intended procedure is that the municipalities receive technical assistance by the CMWU and gradually transfer their staff and assets to it. According to the World Bank, this model led to some improvements like faster repair of leakage and economies of scale. However, the plan <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> fully implemented. The model experienced serious problems which are mainly caused by the unstable political conditions in the Gaza strip since 2008, including differences between municipalities governed by Hamas and Fatah, so that some municipalities refused to transfer their assets and staff to CMWU.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{historians have}} begun to study the {{documentary}} records of the Inquisition. The archives of the Suprema, today held by the National Historical Archive of Spain (Archivo Histórico Nacional), conserves the annual relations of all processes between 1540 and 1700. This material provides information on about 44,674 judgements, the latter studied by Gustav Henningsen and Jaime Contreras. These 44,674 cases include 826 executions in persona and 778 in effigie. This material, however, <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> complete—for example, the tribunal of Cuenca is entirely omitted, because no relaciones de causas from this tribunal have been found, and significant gaps concern some other tribunals (e.g., Valladolid). Many more cases not reported to the Suprema are known from the other sources (i.e., no relaciones de causas from Cuenca have been found, but its original records have been preserved), but {{were not included in}} Contreras-Henningsen's statistics for the methodological reasons. William Monter estimates 1000 executions between 1530 and 1630 and 250 between 1630 and 1730.|$|E

His son, Ibrahim Pasha, was the shortest-reigning monarch of the dynasty. The duration of his rule varies from one source to another, depending on whether or not his reign as regent is taken into account. Contrary to what the short length of his reign might suggest, Ibrahim Pasha <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> a historically negligible figure, although most of his significant achievements were made before his accession to the throne. His successor, Abbas Helmi I, a traditionalist described by Lord Cromer as [...] "an Oriental despot of the worst type," [...] reverted many of his predecessors' reform-minded measures, and is considered the most controversial ruler of his family.|$|E
