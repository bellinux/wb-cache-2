2500|$|On 15 December, Robert Barton was {{questioned}} by Kevin O'Higgins about his notes on Lloyd George's statement about signing the agreement or facing {{a renewal of}} war: [...] "Did Mr Lloyd George single Mr Barton out as the left wing of the delegation and did he say, 'The man who is against peace may bear now and forever the responsibility for terrible and immediate war?'" [...] Barton replied: [...] "What he did say was that the signature and the recommendation of {{every member of the}} delegation was necessary, or war would follow immediately and that the responsibility for that war must rest directly upon those who refused to sign the Treaty". This was seized upon by opponents of the treaty as a convenient proof that the Irish delegates had been subjected to duress at the last minute, and [...] "terrible and immediate war" [...] became a catch-phrase in the debates that followed. The next day, de Valera took up this point: [...] "... therefore what happened was that over there a threat of immediate force upon our people was made. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> document was signed under duress and, though I have a moral feeling that any agreement entered into ought to be faithfully carried out, I have no hesitation in saying that I would not regard it as binding on the Irish nation." ...|$|E

What I wanted him to do was to surround the Eastern army and wait until I came up. But he was insubordinate; he stuck on some quibble of military etiquette about a second lieutenant giving orders to a colonel or something like that. And what was the consequence?

I could see that her face changed when Mr. Prendergast put the matter in that light, which I do not think had occurred to her before. I am thinking of going up to town in a couple of days; I was thinking of doing so tomorrow, but a day or so will make no difference. I propose that you both go with me, and that I then help you look for a house. Even if you don't get one at once, a week in London will be a change, and you can then, if you like, go somewhere for a time. Of course Bath would be too gay at present; but you might go to Tunbridge Wells, or, if she would like a seaside place, as she has never been near the sea since she was a baby, that would be the greatest change for her. You might go down for a month or two to Dover or Hastings. There is no occasion for you to settle down in London for a time. There is Weymouth, too, if you would like it better. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is a cheerful place without being too fashionable." ...|$|E

But I shall not condemn you to idleness and cankering thoughts, my bold blusterer, my terror of the sea, my harrier of the coast, my flaunter of the Jolly Roger washed clean in the tub with soap; I shall give you work to do which shall better suit you than the troublesome trade you've been trying to learn. You write well and read, I know that, my good Sir Nightcap; and, moreover, you are a fair hand at figures. I have great work before me in landing and selling the fine cargoes you have brought me, and in counting and dividing the treasure you have locked in your iron-bound chests. And you shall attend to all that, my reformed cutthroat, my regenerated sea-robber.

6000|$|My dear child, if the {{landlord}} {{of our house}} was {{in the habit of}} pulling the roof down upon our heads, and putting gunpowder under the foundations to blow us up, do you not think we should know what he meant, even though he never spoke a word? He would be very wrong in behaving so, of course: but one thing would be certain,--that he did not intend us to live in his house any longer if he could help it; and was giving us, in a very rough fashion, notice to quit. And {{so it seems to me}} that these poor Spanish Americans have received from the Landlord of all landlords, who can do no wrong, such a notice to quit as perhaps no people ever had before; which says to them in unmistakable words, [...] "You must leave this country: or perish." [...] And <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> message, like all Lady Why's messages, is at heart a merciful and loving one; that if these Spaniards would leave the western coast of Peru, and cross the Andes into the green forests of the eastern side of their own land, they might not only live free from earthquakes, but (if they would only be good and industrious) become a great, rich, and happy nation, instead of the idle, and useless, and I am afraid not over good, people which they have been. For in that eastern part of their own land God's gifts are waiting for them, in a paradise such as I can neither describe nor you conceive;--precious woods, fruits, drugs, and what not--boundless wealth, in one word--waiting for them to send it all down the waters of the mighty river Amazon, enriching us here in the Old World, and enriching themselves there in the New. If they would only go and use these gifts of God, instead of neglecting them as they have been doing for now three hundred years, they would be a blessing to the earth, instead of being--that which they have been.|$|E

In analyzing whether there was sufficient evidence to support a Tribunal's decision I have customarily used the test of whether there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable finder of fact to have found the detainee was an enemy combatant by a preponderance of the evidence. Given the low evidentiary hurdle posed by a preponderance of the evidence standard and the rebuttable presumption of genuiness and accuracy that attaches to the Government evidence, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> the test is satisfied in this case.That is to say that reasonable finders of face could determine that this detainee meets the definition of [...] "enemy combatant" [...] based on the evidence presented.|$|E
