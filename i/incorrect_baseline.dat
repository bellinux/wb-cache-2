40|$|Background: The intention-to-treat {{principle}} {{states that}} all randomised participants should be analysed in their randomised group. The {{implications of this}} principle are widely discussed {{in relation to the}} analysis, but have received limited attention in the context of handling errors that occur during the randomisation process. The aims of this article are to (1) demonstrate the potential pitfalls of attempting to correct randomisation errors and (2) provide guidance on handling common randomisation errors when they are discovered that maintains the goals of the intention-to-treat principle. Methods: The potential pitfalls of attempting to correct randomisation errors are demonstrated and guidance on handling common errors is provided, using examples from our own experiences. Results: We illustrate the problems that can occur when attempts are made to correct randomisation errors and argue that documenting, rather than correcting these errors, is most consistent with the intention-to-treat principle. When a participant is randomised using <b>incorrect</b> <b>baseline</b> information, we recommend accepting the randomisation but recording the correct baseline data. If ineligible participants are inadvertently randomised, we advocate keeping them in the trial and collecting all relevant data but seeking clinical input to determine their appropriate course of management, unless they can be excluded in an objective and unbiased manner. When multiple randomisations are performed in error for the same participant, we suggest retaining the initial randomisation and either disregarding the second randomisation if only one set of data will be obtained for the participant, or retaining the second randomisation otherwise. When participants are issued the incorrect treatment at the time of randomisation, we propose documenting the treatment received and seeking clinical input regarding the ongoing treatment of the participant. Conclusion: Randomisation errors are almost inevitable and should be reported in trial publications. The intention-to-treat principle is useful for guiding responses to randomisation errors when they are discovered.

40|$|Short-TE MRS {{has been}} {{proposed}} recently as a method for the in vivo detection and quantification of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the human brain at 3 [*]T. In this study, we investigated the accuracy and reproducibility of short-TE MRS measurements of GABA at 3 [*]T using both simulations and experiments. LCModel analysis was performed on {{a large number of}} simulated spectra with known metabolite input concentrations. Simulated spectra were generated using a range of spectral linewidths and signal-to-noise ratios to investigate the effect of varying experimental conditions, and analyses were performed using two different baseline models to investigate the effect of an inaccurate baseline model on GABA quantification. The results of these analyses indicated that, under experimental conditions corresponding to those typically observed in the occipital cortex, GABA concentration estimates are reproducible (mean reproducibility error, < 20 %), even when an <b>incorrect</b> <b>baseline</b> model is used. However, simulations indicate that the accuracy of GABA concentration estimates depends strongly on the experimental conditions (linewidth and signal-to-noise ratio). In addition to simulations, in vivo GABA measurements were performed using both spectral editing and short-TE MRS in the occipital cortex of 14 healthy volunteers. Short-TE MRS measurements of GABA exhibited a significant positive correlation with edited GABA measurements (R[*]=[*] 0. 58, p[*]<[*] 0. 05), suggesting that short-TE measurements of GABA correspond well with measurements made using spectral editing techniques. Finally, within-session reproducibility was assessed in the same 14 subjects using four consecutive short-TE GABA measurements in the occipital cortex. Across all subjects, the average coefficient of variation of these four GABA measurements was 8. 7 [*]±[*] 4. 9 %. This study demonstrates that, under some experimental conditions, short-TE MRS can be employed for the reproducible detection of GABA at 3 [*]T, but that the technique should be used with caution, as the results are dependent on the experimental conditions.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} perceived prevalence of smoking and smoking initiation among Hong Kong primary second- to fourth-grade-students. Methods: A cohort of 2, 171 students was surveyed in 2006 and again in 2008. Students who perceived ever-smoking prevalence in peers as "none" or "some" were considered as correct (reference group), whereas those who perceived it as "half" (overestimation) or "most/all" (gross overestimation) were considered as <b>incorrect.</b> Results: At <b>baseline,</b> overestimation {{was found to be}} cross-sectionally associated with ever-smoking (p <. 01). At follow-up, 7. 2 % of never-smoking students with <b>incorrect</b> estimation at <b>baseline</b> had started smoking, which was 79 % (95 % confidence interval: 3 %- 213 %), greater than that of 3. 7 % for those with correct estimation. Among the never-smoking students with incorrect estimation, subsequent correct estimation was associated with 70 % (95 % confidence interval: 47 %- 83 %) lower risk of smoking initiation compared with persistent incorrect estimation. Conclusion: Overestimation of the prevalence of peer smoking predicted smoking initiation among children. Interventions should be carried out to evaluate whether correcting children's overestimation of peer smoking could reduce smoking initiation. © 2011 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. postprin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. MR guided {{interstitial}} {{laser therapy}} {{can be used}} to monitor the extent of tumor tissue coagulation during thermal treatment based on a temperature map. In a non-stationary object that was influenced by respiratory motion, the temperature map may show errors due to <b>incorrect</b> spatial <b>baseline</b> images. Moreover, an unwanted phase shift due to object displacement contributes to errors in the temperature map, that must be suppressed. This paper describes a strategy which addresses the difficulties of MR guided interstitial laser therapy in the presence of respiratory motion. The multi-baseline images, supported by the displacement correction scheme, were used to improve the temporal resolution of a temperature map in the respiratory cycle. In the displacement correction scheme, the object coordinates that are provided by an active tracking coil were employed to support a matching strategy between the thermal and baseline images. To avoid errors in the temperature map due to the motion artifact, a detector of low quality images was proposed as part of the displacement correction scheme. ...|$|R
40|$|C 1 - Journal Articles RefereedBACKGROUND: Postnatal {{morbidity}} is high, {{and many}} GPs lack the confidence and knowledge {{to deal with}} common postnatal problems. There is a high consultation rate, but few women disclose common health problems. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of the present study}} was to increase the knowledge and skills of GPs to enable them to identify and manage common health problems experienced by women in the year following childbirth. METHODS: An educational programme [Guidelines for Assessing Postnatal Problems (GAPP) ] embedded within a large randomized community intervention trial [Program of Resources, Information and Support for Mothers (PRISM) ] with a before/after evaluation was undergone by Australian GPs working in four metropolitan and four rural communities. The programme comprised audit, interactive workshops, role-play and evidence-based guidelines, and was evaluated at baseline and 6 months through written questionnaires and a surgery consultation with a trained simulated patient evaluator. RESULTS: A total of 68 (86 %) GPs took part in the full GAPP programme. The odds of a GP improving on the knowledge items ranged from 1. 0 to 16, with the greatest change occurring in knowledge about the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy for maternal depression. Of the GPs with an <b>incorrect</b> response at <b>baseline,</b> the percentage demonstrating improved knowledge at follow-up ranged from 22 to 100 %. Around half of the GPs demonstrated excellent communication skills at baseline. Of the remaining GPs, more than half demonstrated greatly improved skills to detect common postnatal problems at follow-up. At baseline simulated patient visit, 70 % of GPs inquired about sexual problems yet none inquired about the possibility of abuse, whereas at follow-up 94 % inquired about sexual problems and 51. 5 % facilitated the disclosure of physical and emotional abuse. Anonymous feedback on the programme by participating GPs showed that 89 % believed the programme positively influenced their actual practice. Interestingly, GPs demonstrated greater knowledge and skills in the simulated setting than on the written questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: This relatively brief multifaceted educational programme assisted many participants in improving their knowledge and the skills required to improve both physical and emotional health after birth. Despite being experienced clinicians and participating actively in a programme on interviewing skills, half of the GPs did not facilitate disclosure of the underlying sensitive issue (abuse) during the follow-up consultation and could benefit from further in-depth training in effective communication skills.

40|$|Introduction: Underlying {{spatial memory}} {{and talking about}} spatial layouts are common {{cognitive}} processes (Haun et al. 2005). For example, to locate an object in space it is obligatory to choose a coordinate system called frame of reference in cognition {{as well as in}} its verbal expression. Coding space within different frames of reference requires different cognitive processes (e. g. Neggers et al. 2005). In relative frames of reference the origin of the coordinate system is the viewpoint of a person. In intrinsic frames of reference an object is located in relation to another object (Levinson 2003). FMRI data have suggested that different frames of reference show different patterns of neural activation (Burgess et al. 2002; Committeri et al. 2004). However, the number of existing frames of reference and their neural correlates remain controversial. In an event-related fMRI study we investigated whether differential neural networks for relative and intrinsic frames of reference can be isolated. Methods: In the present study an implicit sentence picture matching task was used to investigate differential neural correlates for relative and intrinsic frames of reference. Twenty-eight healthy human adults (16 women, 12 men) read a sentence describing a spatial scene followed by a picture, and decided whether the sentence matches the picture or not. Feedback was given either supporting a relative or an intrinsic frame of reference. After half of the trails the feedback switched from one reference frame to the respective other reference frame (Fig. 1). Participants were instructed to respond as accurately and as quickly as possible. They responded with their right hand by pressing a key with the index finger for a correct decision and a second key with the middle finger for an <b>incorrect</b> judgment. Two <b>baseline</b> tasks were included (Fig. 1) : a high level baseline (c 5) and a low level baseline (c 6). A 3 Tesla MRI system (Siemens TRIO, Erlangen, Germany) was used to acquire functional images of the whole brain. Using a gradient-echo echo planar scanning sequence 36 axial slices were obtained for each participant (voxel-size 3 x 3 x 3 mm, TR = 2310 ms, field of view = 192, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 75). All functional images were acquired in one run that lasted for 50 minutes. Following the acquisition of functional images a high-resolution anatomical scan (T 1 -weighted MP-RAGE, 176 slices) was acquired. FMRI data were analyzed using BrainVoyager QX (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands). Random-effects whole brain group analyses were performed. The statistical threshold at the voxel level was set at p < 0. 001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons. Results: Intrinsic trials as compared to baseline trials revealed increased activity in the parietal lobe and in the parahippocampal gyrus. Relative as compared to baseline trails revealed a widespread network of activity. Increased activity was observed in occipitotemporal cortices, in the parietal lobe, and in frontal areas. We focused on the direct comparison between relative and intrinsic trials. Results showed increased activity in the left parahippocampal gyrus only for intrinsic trials as compared to relative trails. An ANOVA of the averaged beta-weights with the within factors Reference frame and Condition and the between factor Block order (relative-intrinsic and intrinsic-relative), obtained for all voxels in the parahippocampal gyrus, showed no main effect of Reference frames and Condition. A significant interaction between the factors Reference frame and Condition was observed (p < 0. 05). T-contrasts showed a significant effect for intrinsic (c 4) as compared to relative trials (c 3; p < 0. 001). Conversely, relative as compared to intrinsic trials showed strong increased activity in the left medial frontal gyrus. An ANOVA of the beta-weights in the brain area showed no main effects. A significant interaction between the factors Reference frame and Condition was observed (p < 0. 05). T-contrasts showed a significant effect for intrinsic (c 4) as compared to relative trials (c 3, p < 0. 01). When comparing all intrinsic and relative conditions together to the baseline we observed increased activity in the right and left frontal eye fields (Fig. 2). An ANOVA of the averaged beta-weights with the within factors Reference frame and the between factor Block order obtained for all voxels in the left frontal eye fields showed a main effect of Block order (p < 0. 001) and an trend effect of Reference frame (p = 0. 08). An ANOVA of the averaged beta-weights for all voxels in the right frontal eye fields showed a main effect of Block order (p < 0. 05) only. Conclusions: Using a sentence-picture matching task, we investigated whether differential neural correlates for intrinsic and relative frames of reference can be isolated. Intrinsic trials compared to relative trials showed increased activity in the parahippocampal gyrus whereas relative trails compared to intrinsic trials revealed increased neural activity in the frontal and parietal lobe. Both frames of reference together compared to a baseline show increased activity in the frontal eye fields which was stronger for the second block. This could be related to switching of reference frames (Wallentin et al. 2008). The present results confirm studies which report the parietal lobe to be involved in relative coding (Cohen & Andersen 2002). The neural correlates of intrinsic frames of reference were previously less well investigated. The present results show differential neural networks for both frames of reference that are crucial to spatial language. References: Burgess, N.
