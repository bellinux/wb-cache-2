500|$|Carey co-wrote and co-produced {{the song}} [...] "Whenever You Call" [...] with {{longtime}} collaborator Walter Afanasieff for her album, Butterfly. However, {{in order to}} change the song's tempo and format, Carey decided to re-do the song as a duet with Brian McKnight, because she felt {{it was one of}} the best songs on Butterfly. Carey had also expressed how McKnight's vocals added a great deal to the song, describing the project as [...] "perfecting the song". McKnight shared similar sentiments, saying, [...] "It was amazing to go into the studio with someone who's so successful, and <b>has</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> track record. Mariah is someone who could ask anyone in the world to sing with her, and they called me. The album contains a duet with Whitney Houston ... it's just been great company to be in." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{documentary}} features {{two versions}} of the song, one during the body of the film and the second at its closing, and highlights the sequences of the pain of sexual assault. While the song played, the lead subject, an assault survivor, reminisced about the impact of rape while walking around a college campus. Ziering concluded that having Gaga sing the track fulfilled their need for publicity since she [...] " [...] a whole other demographic. Anyone who <b>has</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> platform to reach all sorts of people that maybe would not necessarily be inclined to be interested in your issue... it's incredible." [...] "Til It Happens to You" [...] leaked onto the Internet before it was officially released, through an unofficial recording made at the film's premiere at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival. In April 2015, Warren confirmed that the song would have an official release and was waiting for a final audio mixing by Gaga. It was later released as a digital download single on September 18, 2015.|$|E
500|$|When Mr. Wick (Craig Ferguson) {{is asked}} to look after Mrs. Lauder's (Nan Martin) prize-winning Hungarian Puli, he decides to pass the task on to his {{employee}} Drew (Drew Carey). Kate O'Brien (Christa Miller) offers to take the dog, Lucky, to Drew's house; but she has to leave suddenly {{to pick up her}} boyfriend Oswald (Diedrich Bader). Drew does not see Kate's note and assumes Lucky is a stray. He takes it to the vet to get it shaved and neutered. When Kate sees the dog, she fears that she, Drew and Mr. Wick will be fired. She finds an advertisement for a pure bred Hungarian Puli, but it costs $4,500. Since no one <b>has</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> money, Oswald suggests they sell their bodies for money. Inspired by The Full Monty, the guys decide to perform a striptease at The Warsaw Tavern to make the money they need. Lewis Kiniski (Ryan Stiles) backs out of the performance at the last minute, but Larry Almada (Ian Gomez) steps in as his replacement.|$|E

500|$|In 2003, Zito {{started off}} with a win against the Mariners. He went 6 innings and allowed an earned run, an RBI single by Olerud in the first inning. In his next start, Zito went 7 innings, struck out 7, walked 4, and allowed one run against Texas. In the process, he became only the fifth A's pitcher to win 10 {{straight}} games, the first since Welch in 1990. On April 18, Zito went nine innings, allowing six hits and no runs in a start against the Rangers. Zito improved to 9–0 in his career against Texas. After the game, Texas manager Buck Showalter said, [...] "I got the feeling he made it look pretty easy. When he <b>has</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> command, {{you can see what}} happens." [...] Zito struggled in his second-to last start before the All-Star Break on July 8. He allowed seven earned runs and 15 hits against the Devil Rays. The 15 hits allowed were a career high. Devil Rays manager Piniella was stunned by Zito's bad start. He said, [...] "If you'd have told me we'd get 15 hits off Zito in five or six innings, I would have looked at you a little funny." [...] Nevertheless, Zito bounced back in his next start. He went eight innings without surrendering a run against the Baltimore Orioles. Zito was again named to the All Star team, the second time he has been named to the team.|$|E

60|$|They {{returned}} the moon last night, and I was SO happy! I {{think it is}} very honest of them. It slid down and fell off again, but I was not distressed; {{there is no need to}} worry when one <b>has</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> neighbors; they will fetch it back. I wish I could do something to show my appreciation. I would like to send them some stars, for we have more than we can use. I mean I, not we, for I can see that the reptile cares nothing for such things.|$|E
60|$|But {{the staff}} helped Perseus along so bravely {{that he no}} longer felt the {{slightest}} weariness. In fact, the stick seemed to be alive in his hand, and to lend some of its life to Perseus. He and Quicksilver now walked onward at their ease, talking very sociably together; and Quicksilver told so many pleasant stories about his former adventures, and how well his wits had served him on various occasions, that Perseus began to think him a very wonderful person. He evidently knew the world; and nobody is so charming to a young man as a friend who <b>has</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> knowledge. Perseus listened the more eagerly, in the hope of brightening his own wits by what he heard.|$|E
5000|$|A wilderness, {{no matter}} how {{impressive}} and beautiful, does not satisfy this soul of mine, (if I <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing). It {{is a challenge to}} man. It says, 'Master me! Put me to use! Make me something more than I am.' ...|$|R

60|$|But I {{lost the}} thread there, and dozed off to slumber, {{thinking}} about what a pity it was that men with such superb strength --strength enabling them to stand up cased in cruelly burdensome iron and drenched with perspiration, and hack and batter and bang each other for six hours on a stretch--should not have been born {{at a time when}} they could put it to some useful purpose. Take a jackass, for instance: a jackass <b>has</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> strength, and puts it to a useful purpose, and is valuable to this world because he is a jackass; but a nobleman is not valuable because he is a jackass. It is a mixture that is always ineffectual, and should never have been attempted in the first place. And yet, once you start a mistake, the trouble is done and you never know what is going to come of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your wife seems a {{very nice}} and {{beautiful}} lady, Arbuthnot," [...] he reflected aloud after dinner, when Mrs. Bastin, glowering as usual, though what at I do not know, had been escorted from the room by Natalie, [...] "and really, when I {{come to think of}} it, you are an unusually fortunate person. You possess a great deal of money, much more than you have any right to; which you seem to have done very little to earn and do not spend quite as I should like you to do, and this nice property, that ought to be owned by a great number of people, as, according to the views you express, I should have thought you would acknowledge, and everything else that a man can want. It is very strange that you should be so favoured and not because of any particular merits of your own which one can see. However, I have no doubt it will all come even in the end and you will get your share of troubles, like others. Perhaps Mrs. Arbuthnot will have no children as there is so much for them to take. Or perhaps you will lose all your money and have to work for your living, which might be good for you. Or," [...] he added, still thinking aloud after his fashion, [...] "perhaps she will die young--she <b>has</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> face, although, of course, I hope she won't," [...] he added, waking up.|$|E
6000|$|The {{father of}} Frederick the Great, {{the founder of}} the more modern Hohenzollerns, was mad. His madness {{consisted}} of stealing giants; like an unscrupulous travelling showman. Any man much over six foot high, whether he were called the Russian Giant or the Irish Giant or the Chinese Giant or the Hottentot Giant, was in danger of being kidnapped and imprisoned in a Prussian uniform. It is the same mean sort of madness that is working in Prussian professors such as the one I have quoted. They can get no further than the notion of stealing giants. I will not bore you now with all the other giants they have tried to steal; it is enough to say that St. Paul, Leonardo da Vinci, and Shakespeare himself are among the monstrosities exhibited at Frederick-William fair--on grounds as good as those quoted above. But I have put this particular case before you, as an artist rather than an Italian, to show what I mean when I object to a [...] "German future for Europe." [...] I object to something which believes very much in itself, and in which I do not in the least believe. I object to something which is conceited and small-minded; but which also <b>has</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> pertinacity which always belongs to lunatics. It {{wants to be able to}} congratulate itself on Michael Angelo; never to congratulate the world. It is the spirit that can be seen in those who go bald trying to trace a genealogy; or go bankrupt trying to make out a claim to some remote estate. The Prussian has the inconsistency of the parvenu; he will labour to prove that he is related to some gentleman of the Renaissance, even while he boasts of being able to [...] "buy him up." [...] If the Italians were really great, why--they were really Germans; and if they weren't really Germans, well then, they weren't really great. It is an occupation for an old maid.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was also}} {{designed}} {{to capitalize on}} the band's appearance on an episode of the TV series Walker, Texas Ranger.
