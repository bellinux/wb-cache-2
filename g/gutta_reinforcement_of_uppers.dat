25|$|A basic {{pit latrine}} can be {{improved}} {{in a number of}} ways. One includes adding a ventilation pipe from the pit to above the structure. This improves airflow and decreases the smell of the toilet. It also can reduce flies when the top of the pipe is covered with mesh (usually made out of fiberglass). In these types of toilets a lid need not be used to cover the hole in the floor. Other possible improvements include a floor constructed so fluid drains into the hole and a <b>reinforcement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>upper</b> part <b>of</b> the pit with bricks, blocks, or cement rings to improve stability.|$|R

40|$|In Experiment I, (a) {{extinction}}, (b) extinction plus <b>reinforcement</b> <b>of</b> {{a discrete}} alternative response, and (c) differential <b>reinforcement</b> <b>of</b> other behavior were each correlated {{with a different}} stimulus in a three-component multiple schedule. The alternative-response procedure more rapidly and completely suppressed behavior than did differential <b>reinforcement</b> <b>of</b> other behavior. Differential <b>reinforcement</b> <b>of</b> other behavior was slightly more effective than extinction alone. In Experiment II, <b>reinforcement</b> <b>of</b> specific alternative behavior during extinction and differential <b>reinforcement</b> <b>of</b> other behavior were used in two components, while one component continued to provide reinforcement for the original response. Once again, the alternative-response procedure was most effective in reducing responding {{as long as it}} remained in effect. However, the responding partially recovered when reinforcement for competing behavior was discontinued. In general, responding was less readily reduced by differential <b>reinforcement</b> <b>of</b> other behavior than by the specific alternative-response procedure...|$|R

40|$|Solutions {{are derived}} for adhesive-bonded joints of non-classical geometries. Particular {{attention}} {{is given to}} bonded doublers and to selective reinforcement by unidirectional composites. Non-dimensionalized charts are presented for the efficiency limit imposed on the skin {{as the result of}} the eccentricity in the load path through the doubler. It is desirable to employ a relativly large doubler to minimize the effective eccentricity in the load path. The transfer stresses associated with selective <b>reinforcement</b> <b>of</b> metal structures by advanced composites are analyzed. <b>Reinforcement</b> <b>of</b> bolt holes in composites by bonded metal doublers is covered quantitatively. Also included is the adhesive joint analysis for shear flow in a multi-cell torque box, in which the bond on one angle becomes more critical sooner than those on the others, thereby restricting the strength to less than the total of each maximum strength when acting alone. Adhesive plasticity and adherend stiffness and thermal imbalances are included.

Substitutability with brain stimulation <b>reinforcement</b> <b>of</b> presses on one lever and either food or water reinforcement for presses on the other was about as high as with brain stimulation for presses on both levers.

40|$|In {{everyday}} decision making, {{people often}} face decisions with outcomes that differ on multiple dimensions. The tradeoff in preferences between magnitude <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> delay to <b>reinforcement,</b> and probability <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> {{is a fundamental}} concern in the decision making literature. Yet, the relative impacts <b>of</b> probability <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> delay to <b>reinforcement,</b> and magnitude <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> have not been studied together even though researchers have been advocating for the combined study of these variables for decades. The proposed project was designed to determine the relative impacts <b>of</b> magnitude <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> and probability <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> {{when they were both}} increasing over a 10 s delay to maximum charge. A first-person shooter video game was adapted for the study of choice when outcome magnitude and probability <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> were increasing either simultaneously (Experiment 1) or separately (Experiment 2) over a 10 s delay. Experiment 1 showed that participants waited longer to ensure a greater probability <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> than to ensure a greater magnitude <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> The results <b>of</b> Experiment 2 indicated that probability <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> had a stronger impact on behavior than magnitude <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> when they were increasing separately.
