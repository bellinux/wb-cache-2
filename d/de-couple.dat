According to the {{connotation}} of dematerialization, {{this paper}} states that dematerialization {{plays an important}} role in deepening the development of Circular Economy (CE), and maintaining balance and function of the eco-economic system. This paper demonstrates the dematerialization nature of CE in terms of <b>de-coupling,</b> and states that the <b>de-coupling</b> between economy and environment is the fundamental goal of CE.

40|$|Area <b>de-coupling</b> is a {{recently}} suggested method for current- or voltage-matching two-terminal tandem modules. It {{has previously been}} shown that under standard conditions, area <b>de-coupled</b> modules have the same theoretical efficiency as four-terminal tandem cells for any combinations of band gaps. In this work, the spectral and temperature sensitivity of ideal area <b>de-coupled</b> modules is investigated by detailed balance modeling. Voltage-matched area <b>de-coupled</b> modules {{are found to be}} considerably less sensitive to changes in the spectrum than current-matched modules. Current-matched modules are, on the other hand, found to be less sensitive to changes in the temperature. Under normal conditions, the difference in temperature sensitivity has a negligible impact on the efficiency compared to the difference in spectral sensitivity, making voltage-matched modules the preferred choice. The difference in efficiency between an area <b>de-coupled</b> voltage-matched module and a four-terminal device is found to be too small to be of any practical consequence even under changing conditions. This finding is in agreement with earlier work by Lentine et al. on microsystem-enabled photovoltaic modules. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{difference}} between individual controlled action and outcomes is best conveyed through an example. In a sales job, a favorable outcome {{is a certain}} level of revenue generated through the sale of something (merchandise, or some service such as insurance). Revenue can be generated or not, depending on the behavior of employees. When the employee performs this sales job well, he is able to move more merchandise. However, certain factors other than employees' behavior influence revenue generated. For example, sales might slump due to economic conditions, changes in customer preferences, production bottlenecks, etc. In these conditions, employee performance can be adequate, yet sales can remain low. The first is performance and the second is the effectiveness of that performance. One can <b>de-couple</b> these two because performance {{is not the same as}} effectiveness.|$|E
50|$|Suspecting {{that they}} are now close to a {{destructive}} collision with the Hastings station buffers, Shaler creates an improvised explosive using the last remaining fire extinguisher. The explosion causes enough damage for Shaler, with help of Carmichael, to <b>de-couple</b> the carriages, however Carmichael falls through the gap in the carriages and is killed instantly. The burning carriages separate as they speed through a suburban station where police officers watch helplessly as the train rushes through with the end car trailing not too far behind. Shaler is left on the front car whilst, Klimowski and Barwell attempt to stop their own carriage with the hand brake at the rear. With the train continuing to burn around him, Shaler takes a moment to compose himself, before running and leaping from the carriage as it explodes, possibly killing the driver and immediately engaging the brakes. The front carriage of the train finally screeches to a stop {{just in front of the}} camera and shows the headlight going off for good.|$|E
50|$|In September 2005, Dr. Reddy's {{spun off}} its drug {{discovery}} and research wing {{into a separate}} company called Perlecan Pharma Private Limited. At the time, this was hailed as an innovative move, but in 2008, the company had to be wound down due to funding constraints. Dr. Reddy's was the first Indian pharma company to attempt such an effort to <b>de-couple</b> risk of drug discovery from the parent company by creating a separate company with external source of funding. Perlecan Pharma was partially funded by ICICI Venture Capital and Citigroup Venture International, both of which held a 43% stake in Perlecan for an estimated $22.5 million. However, the company was forced to buy back the Perlecan shares from ICICI and Citigroup due to doubts regarding the commercial viability of the drug candidates that were in Perlecan's pipeline. At that point, Perlecan became a wholly owned subsidiary. In the board meeting of 23 October 2008, the company chose to amalgamate/absorb Perlecan, thereby making it an in-house research facility, {{as it was before}} 2005.|$|E

40|$|This paper evaluates {{concerns}} over the "abandonment of production" {{in the context of}} the recent CAP reform as it applies to the arable sector. The particular focus of the evaluation is on the extent to which the proposed "single farm payment" can be <b>de-coupled</b> from production and yet avoid the abandonment of land on which production is expected to be profitable. An analytical framework is developed which indicates the most important non-policy factors are the profitability of the land, the variability of yield and the grower's degree of risk aversion. The conclusion of a numerical analysis using this framework is that 85 % <b>de-coupling</b> is unlikely to lead to abandonment of land in any arable region of the EU, and that 95 % <b>de-coupling</b> is also unlikely to lead to abandonment in the majority of arable areas.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a system to}} handle and install exterior cladding on high-rise buildings. The system is innovative in that the cladding panels are installed from the building’s exterior {{without the use of}} a tower crane or man lift, and without on-floor staging. Accordingly, all work pertaining to the panels effectively is <b>de-coupled</b> from most other construction work going on concurrently on site. This results in flexibility and work that can progress at a fast, continuous pace, thereby also allowing for project schedule acceleration. The paper includes illustrations of the use of this innovative cladding installation system in the process of constructing the 70 -story Trump World Tower in New York City. The system was developed recognizing that tight handoffs between trades may lead to detrimental performance. <b>De-coupling</b> of interacting trades is one step towards implementing a lean construction system.

In order to <b>de-couple</b> these two processes, we have measured, for the first time, the solid-state photoluminescent quantum yield of various triboluminescent materials. The measurements highlighted: (i) some triboluminescent materials possess near-optimised radiative yields; (ii) structurally similar triboluminescent compounds can exhibit widely varying yields and (iii) some triboluminescent materials, which appear to the eye as reasonably efficient, possess low radiative yields, allowing possible triboluminescent enhancement...|$|E

For each of the SISO system, we design an optimal robust controller independently, then join them together. As these optimal controllers can tolerate up to 50 % changes in system parameters, the joined system can tolerate the coupling effects and keep its original SISO performance.

40|$|A lean-agile {{model of}} homebuilders' {{production}} systems is proposed in this research. Value stream mapping is utilized {{to clarify the}} proposed lean-agile model, in which pull and Kanban are used to ensure smooth production upstream of the <b>de-coupling</b> point, while fluctuating market demands in terms of variety of homes and variability of volumes are managed by the agile process downstream of the <b>de-coupling</b> point. The <b>de-coupling</b> point is used to provide components to downstream agile process and shield upstream smooth production from market fluctuations. A simulation model is developed to evaluate and validate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed lean-agile model. Simulation experiments show that the lean-agile model prevents the accumulation of high inventory levels and thus provides better customization opportunities for clients compared to even-flow-construction. It also provides a more stable process with shorter cycle times compared to sales-driven production. The proposed lean-agile model offers new possibilities for homebuilders to manage the balance between meeting fluctuating market demands and stabilizing the production system.

40|$|A {{reusable}} {{launch vehicle}} control problem during ascent is addressed via multiple-time scaled continuous sliding mode control. The proposed sliding mode controller utilizes a two-loop structure and provides robust, <b>de-coupled</b> tracking of both orientation angle command profiles and angular rate command profiles {{in the presence of}} bounded external disturbances and plant uncertainties. Sliding mode control causes the angular rate and orientation angle tracking error dynamics to be constrained to linear, <b>de-coupled,</b> homogeneous, and vector valued differential equations with desired eigenvalues placement. Overall stability of a two-loop control system is addressed. An optimal control allocation algorithm is designed that allocates torque commands into end-effector deflection commands, which are executed by the actuators. The dual-time scale sliding mode controller was designed for the X- 33 technology demonstration sub-orbital launch vehicle in the launch mode. Simulation results show that the designed controller provides robust, accurate, <b>de-coupled</b> tracking of the orientation angle command profiles in presence of external disturbances and vehicle inertia uncertainties. This is a significant advancement in performance over that achieved with linear, gain scheduled control systems currently being used for launch vehicles...|$|R

40|$|Speaking to the Irish {{agri-business}} sector on November 11 th 2002, Agriculture Commissioner Fischler {{argued that}} the EU must make 'agriculture more competitive and market oriented'. Emphasising that this objective underpins the Commission's proposals for the mid-term review of the CAP. Commissioner Fischler reiterated the importance: of strengthening the rural development pillar of the CAP; shifting to a <b>de-coupled</b> system of single farm payments linked to cross compliance with environmental, animal welfare and food safety criteria; enhancing the price competitiveness of EU agriculture; promoting higher food quality standards. He affirmed that the <b>de-coupling</b> of farm payments from production {{is still on the}} agenda pointing out that the only alternative to <b>de-coupling</b> would be a 'brusque cut of direct aid', something which the Commissioner felt would hardly be 'the preferred option'. He claimed that the proposed reforms would ensure the EU's role as a major exporter of food and drink products, but emphasised that the EU would have to stick to its WTO obligations to cut-trade distorting support. With regard to the extension of reform to other sectors, Commissioner Fischler pointed out that dairy-sector reforms already agreed would now need to be implemented in 2007 and 2008. This delay he felt would make the reform process more difficult, given the need to reach agreement in an enlarged EU. Comment: Although the timing and the details of the CAP reform process may be subject to considerable uncertainty, recent debates show that the overall direction remains clear, namely towards non-production related <b>de-coupled</b> farm payments. For the ACP the question arises: what will this mean for those products into which ACP exporters have diversified (e. g. cut flowers) which while currently part of the CAP regime are not subject to price support or product-specific direct aid payments? For example would a system of non-production related <b>de-coupled</b> farm payments exert a downward pressure on market prices in the cut flowers sector, to the detriment of ACP suppliers?Speaking to the Irish agri-business sector on [...] ...|$|R
