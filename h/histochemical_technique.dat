40|$|Abstract – The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the prevalence and risk factors concerning Dirofilaria imm-itis infection in dogs from Figueira da Foz, located in the central region of Portugal. In the period between November 2009 and January 2011, 304 blood samples were obtained from dogs over 1 year of age, with no previous history of heartworm prevention or diagnosis. Every blood sample was analyzed using varied laboratory techniques (direct micro-scopic evaluation of a fresh blood sample, the modified Knott technique, and the ELISA antigen detection test – IDEXX Snapp). In the samples in which microfilaremia was detected, a <b>histochemical</b> <b>technique</b> using acid phospha-tase staining was applied to identify the species of microfilariae. A total prevalence of 27. 3 % (83 out of 304) was found. We also found that 73. 5 % of all positive cases (61 out of 83) were microfilaremic, and 26. 5 % were occult infec-tions (22 out of 83). By means of a <b>histochemical</b> <b>technique</b> Dirofilaria immitis was identified in 96. 7 % of microfilare-mic samples.

40|$|Background. The {{oxidative}} {{modification of}} proteins is lately pivotal to pathologists {{and it is}} a new way of research on different pathological conditions, as well as the diagnostics of inflammation processes in placenta. Objective. The study was aimed at the research of nitro peroxides and establishing the specific features of oxidative modification of proteins in inflammation of placenta with iron deficient anaemia in the pregnant. Methods. Сhemiluminescent and <b>histochemical</b> <b>technique</b> (with bromphenol blue on ‘acidic’ and ‘basic’ proteins according to Mikel Calvo) was applied. Results. The intensity of nitro peroxides glow in chorioamnionitis and basal deciduitis increased in comparison with the samples of physiological and iron deficient anaemia gestation. At the same time in chorioamnionitis the glow intensity is higher than in basal deciduitis. Due to the results of immune <b>histochemical</b> <b>technique</b> held while analysing the samples, together with chorioamnionitis and basal deciduitis the R/B increases and in basal deciduitis the rate, is probably, higher, than in chorioamnionitis. At the same time, the extent of oxidative modification of proteins in cases of inflammation with iron deficient anaemia in the pregnant is on the average higher than with no iron deficient anaemia in the pregnant. Conclusions. High level of nitro peroxides in placentae basal plate in secundines inflammation, the increase in R/B rate, in other words the prevalence of ‘acidic’ proteins over ‘basic’ ones, is evidenced due to the increase of the intensity of oxidative modification processes of proteins in cases of deciduitis...|$|E
40|$|Hereditary non-polyposis {{colorectal}} cancer (HNPCC) {{has recently been}} linked to germline defects of DNA repair genes. Colorectal tumours in HNPCC frequently show DNA microsatellite instability, {{but it is not}} certain whether this mutator phenotype occurs throughout the morphologically normal colonic mucosa. We have previously used the mPAS <b>histochemical</b> <b>technique</b> in human colorectal mucosa to identify a polymorphism for O-acetyltransferase activity that shows monogenic inheritance and to show that crypt-restricted loss of O-acetyltransferase activity in heterozygotes is due to somatic mutation. We have now used this <b>histochemical</b> <b>technique</b> to measure the somatic mutation frequency in the uninvolved colon of 12 heterozygous patients with HNPCC, 15 with ileocaecal Crohn's disease and 16 with sporadic {{colorectal cancer}} (CRC). HNPCC patients showed a significant increase in mutation frequency with age (Mann-Whitney U, P = 0. 02). In HNPCC patients aged 50 years than in sporadic CRC cases (4. 9 +/- 3. 4 x 10 (- 4) vs 5. 9 +/- 3. 6 x 10 (- 4), P > 0. 5). We conclude that germline defects in HNPCC do not result in a generalised increase in liability to mutation in normal colonic mucosa but that a second, somatic, event is required. We postulate that this second event occurs in crypt stem cells at low frequency, giving rise to scattered individual crypts composed of mutation-prone cells. The cells in these crypts are then at high risk of acquiring the mutations that lead to adenomas, and to rapid progression to carcinoma...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{ontogenesis}} of the gastroesophageal mucosa involves morphological alterations {{related to}} its structure and the function of each segment. The present study describes the histogenesis of the mucus-secreting epithelium and glands of the esophagus, gizzard, and proventriculus of the chicken (Gallus gallus), and identifies alterations in the secretion pattern of glycosaminoglycans (GAG’s). We analyzed 38 chicken embryos, processed the material collected following the histological routine, and then stained it with hematoxylin-eosin {{for the analysis of}} tissue structure and with Gomori's trichrome for the identification of conjunctive tissue and collagen fibers. We used the PAS <b>histochemical</b> <b>technique</b> for the analysis of neutral GAG’s and the AB pH 2. 5 <b>histochemical</b> <b>technique</b> for the analysis of acid GAG’s. The embryos at late stage of development had the esophagus wall composed of four layers: mucosa, submucosa, muscularis, and serosa, whereas the proventriculus and the gizzard were composed of three layers: mucosa, muscularis, and serosa. In all three segments, we identified the superficial epithelium as mucus-secreting; in the esophagus this epithelium was mucus-secreting only at the initial development stages. The proventricular glands began to form at the initial development stages, whereas the tubular glands began to form in the gizzard just after the 15 th day. The differences in the production of GAG’s in these regions of the digestive tract are related to development stages, functions, and physiological requirements of each segment, and to the gradual adjustmen...|$|E
