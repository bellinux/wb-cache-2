40|$|The {{potential}} {{application of}} <b>fluidized</b> <b>beds</b> in several {{sectors of the}} ferroalloy industry is promising. They {{can be used in}} the direct reduction of iron ores to produce a feed for steelmaking, in the reduction of manganese dioxide to produce a lesser oxide for feeding to smelters, in the preheating of chromite for the production of ferrochrome, and in the calcining and pre-reduction of nickel laterites for the production of ferronickel. This paper discusses the potential of <b>fluidized</b> <b>beds</b> in theses processes and highlights the advantages of the tech-nology over other technologies, such as rotary kilns. Two primary advantages—(1) that <b>fluidized</b> <b>beds</b> can treat fine materials and (2) that <b>fluidized</b> <b>beds</b> can be integrated with smelters in a way that allows for more efficient use of energy—may well see the technology gain prominence as more deposits of lower grade are mined and industries strive to use their resources more efficiently. In discussing the potential of the technol-ogy in the ferroalloy industry, this paper focuses on the application of <b>fluidized</b> <b>beds</b> in the smelting of chr-omite, nickel laterites, and manganese ores.

Modeling of traffic flow and the behavior of biological systems such as ant colonies and bird flocks are commonly referenced examples of this new approach. We have explored the application {{of this type of}} model to describe the dynamics of voids in bubbling <b>fluidized</b> <b>beds.</b> The model considers vertical interactions between neighboring bubbles in <b>fluidized</b> <b>beds.</b> Emergent collective behavior is shown to arise {{in a manner consistent with}} observed experimental behaviors of <b>fluidized</b> <b>beds.</b> One important example is the tendency for larger beds to form a central channel of high void fraction.

40|$|Gas-solid heat {{transfer}} in rotating <b>fluidized</b> <b>beds</b> in a static geometry is theoretically and numerically investigated. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the particle bed temperature {{response to a}} step change in the fluidization gas temperature are presented to illustrate the gas-solid {{heat transfer}} characteristics. A comparison with conventional <b>fluidized</b> <b>beds</b> is made. Rotating <b>fluidized</b> <b>beds</b> in a static geometry can operate at centrifugal forces multiple times gravity, allowing increased gas-solid slip velocities and resulting gas-solid heat transfer coefficients. The high ratio of the cylindrically shaped particle bed "width" to "height" allows a further increase of the specific fluidization gas flow rates. The higher specific fluidization gas flow rates and increased gas-solid slip velocities drastically increase the rate of gas-solid heat transfer in rotating <b>fluidized</b> <b>beds</b> in a static geometry. Furthermore, both the centrifugal force and the counteracting radial gas-solid drag force being influenced by the fluidization gas flow rate in a similar way. rotating <b>fluidized</b> <b>beds</b> in a static geometry offer extreme flexibility {{with respect to the}} fluidization gas flow rate and the related cooling or heating. Finally, the uniformity of the particle bed temperature is improved by the tangential fluidization and resulting rotational motion of the particle bed. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|<b>Fluidized</b> <b>beds</b> are {{commonly}} used in Chemical Engineering as they provide a large degree of mixing and segregation of solids {{as well as a}} large surface area that enable effective heat transfer processes. However, the complexity of the relationships between fundamental parameters makes difficult to predict and compute the dynamic behavior in <b>fluidized</b> <b>beds.</b> As the solid particles exhibit the fluid-like behavior in <b>fluidized</b> <b>beds,</b> it is possible to draw an analogy between solid particles and fluid molecules. Gidaspow (1994) derived the same relation for the Mean Free Path (MFP) of the solid particles in a dilute suspension as the gas molecules through the kinetic theory of gases. Discrete Element Method is a powerful numerical method to determine the mean free path of particles in <b>fluidized</b> <b>beds.</b> In this paper, DEM has been applied in order to examine the mean free path of solid particles moving in a confined space with and without exerting drag force on particles. Then, considering that when particle bed is in full fluidized state, the individual particles undergo a random motion a model has been developed. From this model we are intending to predict the MFP of particles in <b>fluidized</b> <b>beds.</b> The effect of number of particles in the system, particle concentration and particle size has been analyzed.

40|$|Understanding hydrodynamics of {{bubbling}} <b>fluidized</b> <b>beds</b> {{is crucial}} in proper design and scale up of these beds. CFD models have shown promise in gaining this understanding. In order to generate confidence in CFD models, predicted time averaged and dynamical characteristics of the bubbling <b>fluidized</b> <b>beds</b> need to be validated against experimental data.

25|$|A {{completely}} new approach of using SIRs for the separation or purification of biotechnological {{products such as}} proteins {{is based on the}} concept of impregnating porous particles with aqueous polymer solutions developed by B. Burghoff. These so-called Tunable Aqueous Polymer-Phase Impregnated Resins (TAPPIR) enhance aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) by applying the SIR technology. During classical aqueous two-phase extraction, biotechnological components such as proteins are extracted from aqueous solutions by using a second aqueous phase. This second aqueous phase contains e.g. polyethylene glycol (PEG). On the one hand, a low density difference and low interfacial tension between the two aqueous phases facilitate comparatively fast mass transfer between the phases. On the other hand, PEG appears to stabilize the protein molecules, which results in a comparatively low protein denaturation during the extraction. However, a significant drawback of ATPE is the persistent emulsification, which makes phase separation a challenge. The idea behind TAPPIR is to use the advantages posed by SIRs, namely low extractant loss due to immobilization in the pores and less emulsification than in liquid-liquid extraction. This way, the drawbacks of ATPE could be remedied. The setup would consist of a packed column or a <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> rather than liquid-liquid extraction equipment with additional phase separation steps. Nonetheless, as yet only first feasibility studies are on the way to prove the concept. Adrawback of this method is the non-conitnous working mode. The packed column is run similar as a chromatographic column.|$|E
25|$|High-quality {{compound}} fertilizers containing nitrogen co-granulated {{with other}} components such as phosphates {{have been produced}} routinely since {{the beginnings of the}} modern fertilizer industry, but on account of the low melting point and hygroscopic nature of urea it took courage to apply the same kind of technology to granulate urea on its own. But {{at the end of the}} 1970s three companies began to develop fluidized-bed granulation. The first in the field was Nederlandse Stikstof Maatschappij, which later became part of Hydro Agri (now Yara International). Yara eventually sold this technology to Uhde GmbH, whose Uhde Fertilizer Technology (UFT) subsidiary now markets it. Around the same time Toyo Engineering Corporation developed its spouted-bed process, comprising a <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> deliberately agitated to produce turbulent ebullation. Stamicarbon also undertook development work on its own fluidized-bed granulation system, using film sprays rather than atomizing sprays to introduce the urea melt, but shelved it until the 1990s, when there was for a time considerable doubt about the commercial future of the Hydro (UFT) process. As a result, the Stamicarbon technology is now commercialized and highly successful. More recently, Urea Casale introduced a different fluidized-bed granulation system: the urea is sprayed in laterally from the side walls of the granulator instead of from the bottom. This organizes the bed into two cylindrical masses contrarotating on parallel longitudinal axes. The raw product is uniform enough to not require screens.|$|E
