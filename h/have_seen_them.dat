Lax was elected a scholar (i.e. one on a scholarship) of Trinity in 1784; John Cranke and Henry Therond were his tutors, a role which would <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> not only {{teaching}} Lax, but also acting {{in the role of}} in loco parentis. Lax was conferred a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in 1785 and graduated as the Senior Wrangler and was awarded the first Smith's Prize of his year. Until 1790, all examinations at Trinity were written in Latin.|$|E
5|$|Stockport {{remained}} in Division 2 of the Football League {{for seven years}} until 1912–13 when they again had to seek re-election. Stockport gained 22 votes and was therefore re-elected. Despite an unsuccessful 1920–21 campaign that saw Stockport end the season bottom of the Second Division, which would normally <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> face re-election however, they {{were placed in the}} new Third Division North. After winning five of their first six matches; along with going unbeaten from New Years Day 1921 to Easter Weekend 1922; Stockport set the standard for the division and gained their first Football League title when they beat Darlington in front of 18,500 fans at Edgeley Park. Albert Williams (the then manager) was presented with the trophy seven days later before the home game with Lincoln City. This title win began a remarkable coincidence which has occurred in each of Stockport's title winning seasons where Lincoln City have been the last opponents in each of those seasons. Joe O'Kane; who joined Stockport the previous season, was {{a major factor in the}} clubs promotion although he left the club at the end of the season.|$|E

25|$|Their initial {{form was}} promising, with Reading playing the free flowing {{football}} that got them promoted in record-breaking fashion in 2005–06. Reading equalled their highest win under Coppell with a 6–0 victory over Sheffield Wednesday. They also beat the then league leaders Wolves 3–0 at Molineux. The {{latter half of}} the season was less impressive however, particularly at home where they failed to win a single match after January. Eventually they finished the league in 4th place after failing to secure a win against Birmingham that would <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> promoted automatically. In Coppell's final game in charge, Reading lost their playoff semi-final against Burnley. He resigned as manager immediately after the game.|$|E
25|$|As was {{the case}} with Group B, Group C would only send two teams into the Round of 16 as Spain and {{defending}} champions Germany progressed to round two. Coming from two goals down with four minutes left to snatch a 2–2 draw against Spain, the South Koreans very nearly eclipsed that feat against Germany when they came from 3–0 down to lose narrowly 3–2. In spite of these comebacks, South Korea was held to a 0–0 draw against Bolivia in their other group game when a win would <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> through. Spain's late implosion against the South Koreans effectively decided that it would be Germany who won the group and not them.|$|E

25|$|Some {{classical}} and modern scholars have analyzed Abraham's reasoning for hiding Sarah's position as his wife. Rashi argued {{that when a}} stranger comes to town, the proper thing {{to do would be}} to inquire if he needs food and drink, not whether his female companion is a married woman, and hence as Abimelech did the latter, it tipped off Abraham {{to the fact that there}} is no fear of God in this place, and so he lied about his relationship with Sarah in order to avoid being killed.
