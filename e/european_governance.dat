2500|$|On 22 February, François de Rugy {{announced}} {{his support for}} Emmanuel Macron, breaking the commitment requested of former candidates to back {{the winner of the}} primary. While acknowledging that Hamon was the legitimate PS nominee, de Rugy said he preferred [...] "coherence to obedience". On 13 March, Le Parisien reported that Valls, rather than backing Hamon, would urge voters to support Macron {{in the first round of}} the presidential election; Valls denied the report at the time, but on 29 March declared that he would vote for Macron but would not rally behind his candidacy. On 8 April the High Authority of the PS reminded party members to abide by the [...] "principle of loyalty". On 15 March, the PRG announced its support for Hamon, securing concessions on issues pertaining to <b>European</b> <b>governance,</b> and confirmed an agreement with the Socialist Party for the legislative elections; this followed a period of hesitation after the primary in which the party contemplated Macron's candidacy, which secured several of its parliamentarians' support.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the ambivalent character of time in <b>European</b> economic <b>governance</b> {{and how it is}} conceptualized, especially by its constituent expert élites. On the one hand, it serves to rationally order and stabilize power relationships; on the other, it provokes contest about its appropriate use, focused on fiscal and economic reform policies. The article also highlights the different functional specificities in temporal governance in monetary, fiscal, financial stability and economic reform policies and the differences in potential of issues to mobilize political opposition and to produce problems of synchronization. In particular, monetary union forms an inner circle within <b>European</b> economic <b>governance.</b> Its discursive, regulative and strategic effects radiate with varying results into its other circles. Nevertheless, <b>European</b> economic <b>governance</b> is not a single ‘time-rule’ exercise. Finally, the {{article examines}} how, through its ‘compression’ effects on European states, <b>European</b> economic <b>governance</b> raises serious issues about the quality of modern democracy...|$|R

40|$|After {{more than}} a decade of the euro, we have a good idea about what sort of <b>European</b> macro‐economic <b>governance</b> {{structure}} is in the making — its underlying principles and its relationship to EU ‘deepening’ and ‘widening’ and, not least, to globalization. In relation to economic union, above all the single market, the principle of unitary integration provides an overarching framework, its rationale provided by customs union theory. In contrast, monetary union exhibits the principle of differentiated integration, its rationale founded on ‘will and capability’. This duality is expressed in the EU as ‘one market’ co‐existing with several currencies, one of which is the euro. We conceptualize the outcome as ‘transverse integration’ to capture the hybrid, multidimensional and dynamic character of <b>European</b> macro‐economic <b>governance.</b> This concept seeks to show that <b>European</b> macro‐economic <b>governance</b> transcends traditional classifications such as euro ‘insiders’ versus ‘outsiders’ and ‘frontrunners’ versus ‘laggards’ in euro entry. It offers a tool with which to critically examine these classifications. Transverse integration is also multidimensional in capturing the input side (public opinion), governance structures (‘institutional fuzziness’), and output side (performance) of <b>European</b> macro‐economic <b>governance.</b> Finally, it highlights the dynamic character of <b>European</b> macro‐economic <b>governance,</b> showing how the balance between the unitary and differentiated integration principles changes over time. The article argues that it makes more sense to study unitary and differentiated integration as cross‐cutting phenomena in <b>European</b> macro‐economic <b>governance.</b> Experience suggests that differentiation should not be seen as a temporary phenomenon and hence that transverse integration is here to stay...|$|R
