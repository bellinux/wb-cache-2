5|$|The Lexus LS (Japanese: レクサス・LS, Rekusasu LS) is a {{full-size}} luxury car (F-segment in Europe) {{serving as the}} <b>flagship</b> <b>model</b> of Lexus, the luxury division of Toyota. For the first four generations, all LS models featured V8 engines and were predominantly rear-wheel-drive, with Lexus also offering all-wheel-drive, hybrid, and long-wheelbase variants. The fifth generation changed to using a V6 engine with no V8 option.|$|E
5|$|The HTC One (codenamed and retroactively called M7) is a touchscreen-based Android {{smartphone}} designed, developed, {{and manufactured}} by HTC. The smartphone was unveiled on 19 February 2013 at press events in New York City and London and is HTC’s seventh flagship smartphone. It is {{the successor to}} the company’s 2012 <b>flagship</b> <b>model,</b> the One X—which was critically acclaimed, but commercially unsuccessful {{due in part to}} insufficient marketing efforts. To make the device stand out among its competition, the HTC One was developed with a major emphasis on unique hardware and software features; which included a unibody aluminum frame, a 1080p full-HD display, dual front-facing stereo speakers, a camera with a custom image sensor and the ability to automatically generate montages of media, an updated version of HTC’s Sense user experience, BlinkFeed—an aggregator of news and social network content, and an electronic program guide app with the ability to serve as a universal remote via an IR blaster located in the device’s power button.|$|E

25|$|The Audi V8 (Typ 4C) is a four-door, {{full-size}} luxury sedan, {{built by}} Audi in Germany from 1988 to 1993, as the company's <b>flagship</b> <b>model.</b> It {{was the first}} car from Audi to use a V8 engine, and also the first Audi to combine a quattro system with an automatic transmission. Early cars used 3.6-litre V8s, while later cars featured a 4.2-litre version of the engine. The Audi V8 {{was replaced by the}} Audi A8 in 1994, although the A8 was not sold in North America until 1996.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{following}} the début of Lexus, automotive press reports indicated a forthcoming mid-size Lexus coupé {{to compete with}} the luxury coupés of other marques like Mercedes-Benz SL, Acura Legend coupe and Infiniti M30 coupe. At that point, Toyota had no genuine luxury coupés in its model range. A coupe would complement the successful Lexus <b>flagship</b> <b>model,</b> the V8-powered, rear-wheel drive LS 400 sedan. The coupé was going to be targeted towards the American market, and the development effort for its exterior design was handed over to the Calty Design Research center in California in 1987.|$|E

25|$|The Classic {{line was}} {{discontinued}} {{in the middle}} of the 1976 model year. VAM was looking forward to introducing the Pacer model to Mexican market, which would represent its fourth product line, while Mexican legislation at the time allowed only three per marque. Having both the Classic and the Pacer in the luxury market segment would have also caused internal competition. VAM favored the new Pacer over what until that time had been its <b>flagship</b> <b>model.</b> Starting in 1977, VAM's most luxurious model was the Pacer, and its largest sized models were the Americans (AMC Hornets).|$|E
25|$|American Motors had partial {{ownership}} of Vehiculos Automotores Mexicanos (VAM) and the Mexican operation produced equivalent AMC Rebel models. Mexican regulations required VAM vehicles {{had to have}} at least 60% locally sourced parts. The large-sized VAM cars in only two body styles, a two-door hardtop called the Rambler Classic SST, and a four-door sedan called the Rambler Classic 770 under license from 1967 through 1970, no other trim levels or designations were available. The car was VAM's entry in the luxury segment of the Mexican auto market in contrast with its other lines that focused on economy. The VAM Classic represented the company's <b>flagship</b> <b>model,</b> a treatment that in the United States was given to the AMC Ambassador models.|$|E

50|$|There {{has been}} a trickle-down of {{research}} from <b>flagship</b> <b>models,</b> particularly since {{the launch of the}} 5-Series. Subtle mechanical and electronic changes introduced in lower-rung products — as a result of research at the flagship product level — have contributed to build and sound quality: control of internal heat dissipation, wiring, radio-frequency interference and mechanical vibration through more efficient materials, compliant mounting and decoupling.|$|R

2500|$|The Oldsmobile 98 (sometimes spelled Ninety-Eight after 1958) is the {{full-size}} <b>flagship</b> <b>model</b> of Oldsmobile {{that was}} produced from 1940 until 1996. The name [...] reflecting a [...] "Series 90" [...] fitted with an 8-cylinder engine [...] {{first appeared in}} 1941 and was used again after American consumer automobile production resumed post-World War II. It was, as it would remain, the division's top-of-the-line model, with lesser Oldsmobiles having lower numbers such as the A-body [...] 66 and 68, and the B-body 76 and 78. The Series 60 was retired in 1949, the same year the Oldsmobile 78 {{was replaced by the}} 88. The Oldsmobile 76 was retired after 1950. This left the two remaining number-names to carry on into the 1990s as the bread and butter of the full-size Oldsmobile lineup until the Oldsmobile Regency replaced the 98 in 1997.|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson dislikes the British car brand Rover, {{the last}} major British owned and built car manufacturer. This view {{stretched}} back to the company's time as part of British Leyland. Describing {{the history of the}} company up to its last <b>flagship</b> <b>model,</b> the Rover 75, he paraphrased Winston Churchill and stated [...] "Never in the field of human endeavour has so much been done, so badly, by so many," [...] citing issues with the rack and pinion steering system. In the latter years of the company Clarkson blamed the [...] "uncool" [...] brand image as being more of a hindrance to sales than any faults with the cars. On its demise, Clarkson stated [...] "I cannot even get teary and emotional about the demise of the company itself – though I do feel sorry for the workforce." [...] Clarkson has also expressed hatred for the Toyota Prius.|$|E
2500|$|Nissan {{sought to}} elevate {{the status of the}} DR30 Skyline as their new <b>flagship</b> <b>model</b> in light of this success, and it {{received}} a generous amount of changes to distinguish it from lesser Skyline models in August 1983. Interior equipment was significantly upgraded to now include electric windows, air conditioning and power steering as standard in the new RS-X model (for Extra) with an increased curb weight of around [...] it also included a driver's seat with multi-way power lumbar adjustment, anti-skid control, fog lamps, rear deck spoiler and other features such as dimmable instrument cluster lighting; gone were the days of the spartan, stripped-out race interior, although this could still be specified at time of purchase. But by far the most striking change to the RS was the new unique front end treatment, nicknamed Tekkamen (...) or Iron Mask by fans for its distinctive look. The headlights were considerably slimmer, and instead of a conventional grille the bonnet now sloped down to two narrow slits above a facelifted front bumper and airdam.|$|E

40|$|After {{entering}} the smartphone era, Samsung has recorded enormous growth {{in sales and}} profits. It developed {{state of the art}} hardware technology and introduced innovative features with its <b>flagship</b> <b>models,</b> the Galaxy S series. While it emphasized high-end product development to compete with global vendors such as Apple, Samsung expanded its product portfolio to the affordable segment. In the early stages, this strategy succeeded in increasing revenues and market share. However, as Chinese vendors emerge in the global mobile device market, Samsung has struggled to keep its market share in the low-end device markets. Relatively cheap Chinese devices have attacked Samsung's affordable segment. Samsung's strategy of utilizing economies of scale and the halo effect from <b>flagship</b> <b>models</b> was not effective to compete against the price competitiveness of Chinese. Since the dynamic aspects of competition and the importance of platform are increasing, Samsung needs to build a new sustainable portfolio strategy integrating its platform service and hardware portfolio. by Soo Jin Go.

2500|$|The <b>flagship</b> <b>model</b> {{was created}} when Rover {{introduced}} a [...] fuel-injected {{version of its}} V8. Borrowing from technologies pioneered in the US and Australian markets (where strict emissions regulations meant the inclusion of high compression carburetted engines was not feasible) the new derivative was originally only available in the Vitesse model, but from 1984 onwards it was also offered in the luxury Vanden Plas range, badged as the Vanden Plas EFi. To {{meet the demands of}} the luxury executive car market, where automatic transmission tended to be preferred, Rover first offered an auto as an option in the Vitesse, but later withdrew the option and lured the customers to the plush Vanden Plas EFi instead which had all the standard comforts of the Vitesse, such as electric mirrors, windows and locks, a trip computer, headlight washers, an adjustable steering column and a four-speaker stereo (something special at that time). Additionally, it added as standard leather seats (velour cloth was a no-cost option), an electrically operated sunroof (available on all models) and cruise control; the only option being air-conditioning. Very rare are the [...] "Twin Plenum" [...] Vitesses; these had two throttle bodies mounted on the plenum chamber instead of one and were produced in very small numbers as homologation for the twin plenum racers.|$|E
