40|$|ABSTRACT: Pulmonary {{fibrosis}} {{is characterized}} by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins within the pulmonary interstitium. The new macrolide immunosuppressant SDZ RAD, a rapamycin analogue, inhibits growth-factor dependent proliferation of mesenchymal cells and might therefore be of therapeutic interest {{for the treatment of}} fibrotic lung disease. In this study the effect of SDZ RAD on lung-collagen accumulation in the bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis in rats was investigated. SDZ RAD (2. 5 mg?kg- 1 ?day- 1) or <b>drug</b> <b>vehicle</b> were administered orally by daily gavage. Successful dosing was confirmed by measuring splenic weight. Total lung-collagen content was measured by high-performance liquid chromatographic quantitation of hydroxyproline. In animals given bleomycin and <b>drug</b> <b>vehicle,</b> total lung collagen was increased by 182 ¡ 11 % (mean¡SEM) compared with saline controls at 14 days (pv 0. 001). The increase in lung-collagen accumulation was reduced by 75 ¡ 12 % (pv 0. 01) in animals given SDZ RAD and was accompanied by a concomitant 56 ¡ 6 % (pv 0. 001) reduction in lung weight. SDZ RAD is currently in clinical trials for the prevention of solid organ graft rejection, another condition characterized by excessive extracellular matrix production.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Dexamethasone (DEXA) is {{commonly}} used to reduce brain swelling during neurosurgical procedures. DEXA, however, has many side-effects that can increase the risks of post-operative complications. In contrast, progesterone (PRO) has fewer side-effects and {{has been found to}} be neuroprotective on traumatic brain injury (TBI). Whether PRO may be used as an alternative to DEXA during routine procedures has not been fully explored. OBJECT: To compare the effects of DEXA and PRO on surgical brain injury (SBI). METHODS: Seventy-five adult male Sprague Dawley rats were randomized into five groups: (1) SBI + <b>drug</b> <b>vehicle</b> (peanut oil, 1 [*]ml kg(- 1)); (2) SBI + DEXA (1 [*]mg kg(- 1)); (3) SBI + low-dose PRO (10 [*]mg kg(- 1)); (4) SBI + high-dose PRO (20 [*]mg kg(- 1)); and (5) sham SBI + <b>drug</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Magnetic resonance imaging study and assessments of brain water content (BWC), blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, cellular inflammatory responses and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP- 9) expression were conducted. RESULTS: This model consistently resulted in increased BWC and BBB disruption. PRO reduced astrocyte and microglia responses and attenuated brain oedema with preservation of BBB. A significant down-regulation of MMP- 9 expression occurred in the PRO 20 group. CONCLUSIONS: PRO is as effective as DEXA in reducing brain oedema and inflammation following SBI; 10 [*]mg kg(- 1) of PRO was demonstrated to be more effective in relieving acute cellular inflammatory responses...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is {{the most}} potent poison known to mankind. Currently no {{antidote}} is available to rescue poisoned synapses. An effective medical countermeasure strategy would require developing a drug that could rescue poisoned neuromuscular synapses and include its efficient delivery specifically to poisoned presynaptic nerve terminals. Here we report a drug delivery strategy that could directly deliver toxin inhibitors into the intoxicated nerve terminal cytosol. Results A targeted delivery vehicle was developed for intracellular transport of emerging botulinum neurotoxin antagonists. The <b>drug</b> delivery <b>vehicle</b> consisted of the non-toxic recombinant heavy chain of botulinum neurotoxin-A coupled to a 10 -kDa amino dextran via the heterobifunctional linker 3 -(2 -pyridylthio) -propionyl hydrazide. The heavy chain served to target botulinum neurotoxin-sensitive cells and promote internalization of the complex, while the dextran served as a platform to deliver model therapeutic molecules to the targeted neurons. Our {{results indicated that the}} <b>drug</b> delivery <b>vehicle</b> entry into neurons was via BoNT-A receptor mediated endocytosis. Once internalized into neurons, the drug carrier component separated from the <b>drug</b> delivery <b>vehicle</b> in a fashion similar to the separation of the BoNT-A light chain from the holotoxin. This <b>drug</b> delivery <b>vehicle</b> could be used to deliver BoNT-A antidotes into BoNT-A intoxicated cultured mouse spinal cord cells. Conclusion An effective BoNT-based <b>drug</b> delivery <b>vehicle</b> can be used to directly deliver toxin inhibitors into intoxicated nerve terminal cytosol. This approach can potentially be utilized for targeted drug delivery to treat other neuronal and neuromuscular disorders. This report also provides new knowledge of endocytosis and exocytosis as well as of BoNT trafficking. </p...|$|R

EVs modulate recipient cell function by acting as transport vehicles of lipids, proteins and RNA.

SC- 236 treatment significantly reduced tumour burden, the number and size of spontaneous metastases following primary tumour excision. SC- 236 treatment also reduced tumour burden, the number and size of experimental metastases. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that COX- 2 inhibition reduced microvessel density and increased apoptosis within both spontaneous and experimental metastases.

Seven subjects, all from the asthmatic group, developed at least one immediate FEV 1 fall of 20 % or more. The reactions ranged up to 71 % and occurred to both test solutions.

Skin prick tests using the gentamicin solution were negative in all subjects.

NEMB 2013 - 93028 Successful therapies {{often require}} the use of drugs, which should be {{delivered}} to the target and be released for a certain period of time. To achieve targeted release with a suitable drug release profile, the <b>drug</b> delivery <b>vehicles</b> that first encapsulate and subsequently release the drugs need to be tailored. Conventional <b>drug</b> delivery <b>vehicles,</b> such as polymer microspheres, enable the tuning of the drug release profiles by varying their size, size distribution, as well as the degradation rates of the microspheres. However, more complex release profiles, such as zeroth order release, cannot be easily achieved with polymer microspheres. Moreover, important current approaches to prepare these polymer microspheres are often emulsion-based; they typically involve the use of organic solvents, which may lead to degradation of the drugs involved. Furthermore, certain therapies {{require the use}} of a cocktail of multiple drugs, which can include both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. Co-encapsulation and sequential release of hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs are challenging to achieve with existing <b>drug</b> delivery <b>vehicles.</b> Therefore, novel approaches to fabricate delivery vehicles for encapsulating both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, with complicated drug release kinetics, without the use of organic solvents, are desired. In our work, we propose the use of multiphase microfluidics to prepare <b>drug</b> delivery <b>vehicles</b> with complex structures, such as core-shell capsules, multicompartment microspheres and nonspherical particles; by tailoring the spatial distribution of drugs, unconventional drug release profiles can be achieved. To avoid the use of harmful organic solvents, we introduce the use of aqueous two-phase systems in microfluidics to generate the emulsion templates for making these novel delivery vehicles. By manipulating the interfacial characteristics of the emulsion templates, complex structures with hydrophilic and hydrophobic compartments can be prepared for separate encapsulation and sequential release of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs.
