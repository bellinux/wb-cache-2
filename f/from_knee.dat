5|$|On 11 November 2014, Fahey {{switched}} to Shamrock Rovers. He {{announced his retirement}} in August 2015 having failed to recover <b>from</b> <b>knee</b> surgery. His last ever game of professional football {{turned out to be}} the 2–1 FAI Cup loss to his old club St Patrick's Athletic at Richmond Park as he was substituted off with his knee injury.|$|E
5|$|Playing {{regularly}} {{in his first}} season under Houllier's reign, Berger scored nine goals and improved as a player. An injury sustained in a 4–3 defeat to Leeds United in November 2000 rendered Berger unavailable for much of the 2000–01 season and required specialist treatment in the United States <b>from</b> <b>knee</b> surgeon Richard Steadman. By March 2001, Berger had recovered and he went on to feature in the final of both the UEFA Cup and the FA Cup, with Liverpool winning both trophies. In the 2001 FA Cup Final he provided the assist for Michael Owen to score the deciding goal against Arsenal.|$|E

5|$|As the 1943 season began, the White Sox held strong {{doubts about}} Grove's {{status as a}} pitcher. They were so {{doubtful}} of his recovery <b>from</b> <b>knee</b> surgery that Grove was signed to a $1 contract until he could prove that his playing ability was back on par with the abilities of the other White Sox pitchers. After Grove proved himself in spring training, manager Jimmy Dykes gave him his first major test of the season against the New York Yankees in relief of Eddie Smith. He won the game in extra innings, and {{was placed in the}} starting rotation. In 1943, Grove had to deal with issues related to World War II and the selective service. He was originally classified as 3-A, meaning that registration was deferred due to hardship to dependents, but was ordered to take the selective service screening examination in Cleveland in mid-May. After the examination, Grove was classified as 4-F, making him ineligible for military service, which meant that he could continue his baseball career.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Copeland {{initially}} made $210 {{per week}} {{while working for}} WWF without an official contract. The company also paid for his outstanding college debt, which was around $40,000. After a Grand Prix Wrestling tour {{in the summer of}} 1997, De Marco urged Copeland to go to Calgary, where Hart was informally training wrestlers while recovering <b>from</b> <b>knee</b> surgery. He spent his tour earnings on a plane ticket and landed with no money or place to stay. He called Johnny Smith, whom he would met twice, and Smith agreed to give him food and shelter. Smith also drove Copeland to and from the gym and Hart's house, where he trained alongside Ken Shamrock, Test, Mark Henry and Kurrgan. Copeland returned to the Maritimes for another Grand Prix tour before going back to Hart's house, bringing Christian with him. After this camp, Hart was impressed enough to put in a good word for both men at the WWF.|$|E

Michael Vaughan's return <b>from</b> <b>knee</b> surgery was cut short by a hamstring injury and he was only able to play two matches, leaving Flintoff in charge for the remaining games. England qualified in the last game of eight group matches for the best-of-three finals against Australia, but reversed their poor form on tour with a 2–0 series win in the finals.|$|E
25|$|The lone {{highlight}} of the Bullets 30-win 1990–91 season was the successful comeback effort by Bernard King as he recovered <b>from</b> <b>knee</b> surgery he suffered while playing for the Knicks in the 1984–85 NBA season to finish third in the NBA in scoring with a 28.4 points per game. In 1990, the team named Susan O'Malley as its president, the first female president of a franchise {{in the history of}} the NBA. Susan O'Malley is the daughter of Peter O'Malley, the prominent lawyer from Maryland and former president of the Washington Capitals.|$|E

His widow Franca – to whom he {{had been}} married since 1976 – said he had also been suffering from liver cancer. Upon Mulligan's death, his library and numerous personal effects (including a gold-plated Conn baritone saxophone) were given to the Library of Congress. 'The Gerry Mulligan Collection' is open to registered public researchers in the library's Performing Arts Research Center. The library placed Mulligan's saxophone on permanent exhibit in early 2009.|$|E

In addition, Clark was also in serious pain <b>from</b> <b>knee</b> injuries and has to deal with her son's food allergies and ADHD. However, it was later reported that Sherri Shepherd, host of The View, has helped get back on her feet by promising to pay six months of her rent, gas and electric cost.|$|E
25|$|The 2012–13 {{season was}} a {{struggle}} for the Mavericks, as Nowitzki recovered <b>from</b> <b>knee</b> surgery and missed 29 games. In addition, Collison was inexperienced at the point, leading the Mavericks to sign veteran Derek Fisher for nine games, before settling on Mike James. Mayo was the team's leading scorer {{for the first two}} months of the season before Nowitzki's return saw his averages dip. Kaman and Brand were also hounded by injuries. The Mavericks were 23–29 at the All-Star break, before making a late push for a playoff berth. Still, it did not save their season, and the Mavericks missed the playoffs {{for the first time since}} 2000.|$|E
