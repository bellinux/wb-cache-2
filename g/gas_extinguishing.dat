Civil {{aircraft power plant}} compartment has been a difficult area for its high velocity flow field formed after fire happens. Focusing on this issue, certain results, such as mass flow rate of agent gas, total mass of agent and extinguishing efficiency were presented. A typical apparatus of fire extinguishing system was set up, and its fire-fighting efficiency was evaluated. Critical ratio of mass flow rate and flow velocity, gas discharge time and locations of gas sample tubes were recommended. The results and data can provide a practical way in fire extinguishing system evaluation in civil aircraft power plant compartment...|$|E

40|$|With highly {{accelerated}} {{developments in}} computing and communications technology, society's overall dependence on this equipment {{is becoming increasingly}} acute. In areas such as critical electronic data processing centres and telecommunication hubs, {{one of the main}} protection objectives is to achieve minimum operational disruption, as downtime resulting from a fire condition could lead to huge financial losses. Minimising negative impact on an organization and the need for a sound basis in the decision making process are the fundamental reasons why companies implement fire risk management for their essential information technology systems. For many years a key element used to protect these critical assets was the installation of a fixed Halon 1301 <b>gas</b> <b>extinguishing</b> system. Often, the mere presence of a computer was sufficient justification to install such a system and little thought was given to any systematic fire risk assessment of the installation. This led to the use of Halon 1301 where other fire extinguishing systems and protection techniques could have been applied with equal effectiveness and at comparable costs. The cessation of production of halon {{as a result of the}} Montreal Protocol gave fresh impetus to the development of suitable alternative fire extinguishing agents. It also offered fire protection engineers an opportunity to re-evaluate existing loss control techniques and to examine alternative fire protection strategies. However, it is argued in this study, that an appropriate level of automatic fire protection can only be determined by the use of a suitable quantitative risk assessment and a number of such methodologies are critically examined. There are a significant number of contributing factors that must be considered when deciding which fire suppression system to select for a new installation or whether to retrofit fire suppression on a legacy platform. Consequently, it is necessary to develop a methodology to quantify any fire suppression technology by its life cycle cost and then to apply informed technical opinion into this system. The results of this assessment procedure offer a number of possible fire engineering solutions including a quite diverse range of automatic fire extinguishing techniques and these are discussed and evaluated in detail. Inevitably, a high proportion of such critical risks will require the installation of an automatic fire suppression system. The main halocarbon and inert replacement extinguishing agents are therefore critically compared and contrasted for their suitability in protecting these facilities. A complete review of these extinguishing agents was conducted which focused on suppression mechanisms; quantification of their performance and qualities; interaction with a fire and potential damage to electrical equipment from the release of a given agent. It is shown that all the post-halon extinguishing agents are deficient in some important areas. Major issues such as the formation of thermal decomposition products, the protection of continuously energized electrical circuits and the adequacy of the specified design and extinguishing concentrations have generally not been adequately addressed. Unfortunately, some of these issues are not even resolved in the current gaseous fire extinguishing standards which offer minimal advice from either a design or installation standpoint. This study demonstrates that existing international design standards are deficient in some fundamental areas and that, in a number of circumstances, systems installed to these standards are inadequate to fully protect the hazard in question. A number of recommendations are presented to address some of these deficiencies. Finally, a semi-quantitative risk assessment methodology for the selection of suitable extinguishing agents is proposed. Initially, this attempts to synthesize the results derived from the critical extinguishing agent review and then applies an application weighting factor based on expert consensus to provide a final score for a particular suppression mechanisms suitability to protect a given application...|$|E

50|$|Hermann Löns {{was born}} on 29 August 1866 in Kulm (now Chełmno, Poland) in West Prussia. He was one of twelve siblings, of whom five died early. His parents were Friedrich Wilhelm Löns (1832-1908) from Bochum, a teacher, and Klara (née Cramer, 1844-96) from Paderborn. Hermann Löns grew up in Deutsch-Krone (West Prussia). In 1884, the family {{relocated}} back to Westfalen as his father found a position in Münster. A sickly child who survived typhus, Löns graduated from school on his second try with the Abitur in 1886. Urged by his father, he began to attend courses at Münster university in preparation for studying medicine. In 1887, he started his {{studies at the university}} of Greifswald. There he joined a dueling fraternity (Turnerschaft Cimbria), but was dismissed cum infamia (with infamy). In November 1888, Löns relocated to the university of Göttingen, but returned to Münster without having attained a degree. In fact, he never even enrolled at Göttingen but joined a drinking society called the Club der Bewusstlosen. At Münster he studied natural sciences emphasizing zoology at the Theologische und Philosophische Akademie from the spring of 1889 to autumn 1890. While there, he developed interests in environmental issues - protecting nature from damage by industrial activity - and in literature. However, he was also arrested in 1889 for disorderly conduct and sentenced to five days in jail for <b>extinguishing</b> <b>gas</b> lights and resisting arrest while drunk.|$|R

40|$|AbstractSince {{the phase}} out of Halon {{extinguishers}} in the 1980 s, hot aerosol fire suppression technology has gained much attention. Unlike traditional inert gas, foam, water mist and Halon fire suppression agents, hot aerosol fire extinguishing agents {{do not need}} to be driven out by pressurized <b>gases</b> and can <b>extinguish</b> class A, B, C, D and K fires at 30 to 200 g/m 3. Generally, hot aerosol fire extinguishing technology has developed from a generation I oil tank suppression system to a generation III strontium salt based S-type system. S-type hot aerosol fire extinguishing technology greatly solves the corrosion problem of electrical devices and electronics compared to potassium salt based generation I & II hot aerosol fire extinguishing technology. As substitutes for Halon agents, the ODP and GWP values of hot fire extinguishing aerosols are nearly zero, but those fine aerosol particles can cause adverse health effects once inhaled by human. As for configurations of hot aerosol fire extinguishing devices, fixed or portable cylindrical canisters are the most common among generation II & III hot aerosol fire extinguishers across the world, while generation I hot aerosol fire suppression systems are integrated with the oil tank as a whole. Some countries like the U. S., Australia, Russia and China, etc. have already developed standards for manufacturing and quality control of hot aerosol fire extinguishing agents and norms for hot aerosol fire extinguishing system design under different fire protection scenarios. Coolants in hot aerosol fire suppression systems, which are responsible for reducing hot aerosol temperature to avoid secondary fire risk are reviewed for the first time. Cooling effects are generally achieved through vaporization and endothermic chemical decomposition of coolants. Finally, this review discussed areas applying generation I, II or III hot aerosol fire suppression technologies. The generation III hot aerosol fire extinguishing system is most applicable, especially in areas involving delicate electrical and electronic equipments. Nonetheless, developing a much cleaner, non-corrosive and highly efficient hot aerosol fire suppression system is still needed...|$|R
