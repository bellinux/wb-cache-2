For a planar electrode, we find an analytical expression for the <b>differential</b> <b>capacitance,</b> which is examined in the limits of low and high applied potential. In the low potential limit, a reduction of the solution relative permittivity caused by the ion polarizability causes the <b>differential</b> <b>capacitance</b> to decrease above a certain concentration, relative to the Gouy-Chapman-Stern theory. A similar effect is observed for the excluded volume, but only if the ions are of different sizes. In the high potential limit, the <b>differential</b> <b>capacitance</b> decreases inversely with the square root of the applied voltage. In a mixed electrolyte, asymmetries in both ion size and excess polarizability alter the surface adsorption of species: at high potentials, smaller ions displace larger ions and less polarizable ions displace more polarizable ions.

40|$|The <b>differential</b> <b>capacitance</b> of the {{electrical}} double layer at glassy carbon, platinum and gold electrodes immersed in various ionic liquids {{was measured using}} impedance spectroscopy. We discuss the influence of temperature, {{the composition of the}} ionic liquids and the electrode material on the differential capacitance/potential curves. For different systems these curves have various overall shapes, but all include several extremes and a common minimum near the open circuit potential. We attribute this minimum to the potential of zero charge (PZC). Significantly, the <b>differential</b> <b>capacitance</b> generally decreases if the applied potential is large and moving away from the PZC. This is attributed to lattice saturation [A. A. Kornyshev, J. Phys. Chem. B, 2007, 111, 5545] effects which result in a thicker double layer. The <b>differential</b> <b>capacitance</b> of the double layer grows and specific adsorption diminishes with increasing temperature.

In ionic liquids with PMI+ (1 -methyl- 3 -propylimidazolium) or OMI+ (1 -methyl- 3 -octylimidazolium) cations, the rising of capacitance from about - 0. 5 V disturbs the bell-shaped feature. In-situ STM characterizations reveal the generality of surface etching and micelle-like adsorption of imidazolium cations on Au(100) at potential around the peaks of the bell-shaped feature, demonstrating that the potential of zero charge (PZC) should locate at the potential close to the peaks.

This work implements a generic coarse-grained model for imidazolium-based ionic liquids within the framework of classical density functional theory. Interfacial structures of the coarse-grained model are compared over a range of surface charge densities, alkyl chain lengths and surface geometries. The <b>differential</b> <b>capacitance</b> of the electric double layer, formed by ionic liquids against a charged electrode, is analysed {{as a function of the}} surface electric potential. A comparison of planar, cylindrical and spherical surfaces confirms the curvature effect that the <b>differential</b> <b>capacitance</b> increases and varies less with surface potential at more curved interface. By including ion pairs and higher-order clusters, we explore the influence of aggregate formation in ionic liquids confined between planar charged surfaces. The short-range structure adjacent to surfaces is remarkably unaffected by the degree of ion association. The physical implications of ion pairing or clustering only become apparent in equilibrium properties that depend upon the long-range screening of charges, such as the asymptotic behaviour of surface forces and the <b>differential</b> <b>capacitance.</b> The size of ion cluster, only slightly influences surface force, but has a significant effect on the <b>differential</b> <b>capacitance.</b> Driven by &# 960;-&# 960; stacking in imidazolium-based ionic liquids, polydisperse chains of aggregating cations are incorporated in our theory. Again, the resulting structural profiles remained very similar to the non-associating model.

Their high ionic strength and strong coupling make them useful {{for a number}} of applications, e. g. as electrolytes in supercapacitors. These properties also make them interesting subjects for theoretical research, as the canonical theories of the electrical double layer fail under these conditions. We implement coarse-grained models of RTILs into Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and Classical Density Functional Theory (DFT) to investigate their behaviour at electrode surfaces. A prewetting transition is found for a dilute RTIL and solvent mixture, with a large <b>differential</b> <b>capacitance</b> spike found in the sub critical region. Investigation of capillary condensation for a similar mixture in a pore yields another <b>differential</b> <b>capacitance</b> spike, which decreases away from critical conditions. DFT and MC are compared for a new model RTIL with the former containing a new innovation in describing charge-charge correlations, which gives good agreement for fluid structures at a surface. Pressure-distance curves are computed with DFT for a homologous series of aromatic RTILs, showing the range of interactions to increase with alkyl chain length. Increasing surface charge density causes the amplitude of the interaction free energy curves to decrease. Image charge interactions are examined for a primitive model electrolyte using MC and a new image-corrected Poisson-Boltzmann DFT formulism (iPB), that record good agreement. Increasing salt concentration enhances the desolvation repulsion, and incorporating a basic model for specific adsorption predicts that a colloidal dispersion can be stabilised in this way. The final paper discusses DFT formulism in detail for ionic systems, including new results.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{electric}} double layer by combining the effects of ion finite size and dielectric decrement. At high surface potential, both mechanisms can cause saturation of the counter-ion concentration near a charged surface. The modified Grahame equation and <b>differential</b> <b>capacitance</b> are derived analytically for a general expression of a permittivity epsilon(n) {{that depends on the}} local ion concentration, n, and under the assumption that the co-ions are fully depleted from the surface. The concentration at counter-ion saturation is found for any epsilon(n), and a criterion predicting which of the two mechanisms (steric vs. dielectric decrement) is the dominant one is obtained. At low salinity, the <b>differential</b> <b>capacitance</b> as function of surface potential has two peaks (so-called camel-shape). Each of these two peaks is connected to a saturation of counter-ion concentration caused either by dielectric decrement or by their finite size.

At high salinity, we obtain and analyze the crossover in the <b>differential</b> <b>capacitance</b> from a double-peak shape to a uni-modal one.
