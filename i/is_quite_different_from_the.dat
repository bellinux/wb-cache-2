5|$|Favret {{points out}} that Wollstonecraft's Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> despondent and plaintive love letters she {{actually}} sent to Imlay; the travel narrative much more closely resembles the personal journal in which she recorded her thoughts regarding the people she encountered and the places she visited. While her letters to Imlay contain long passages focused almost exclusively on herself, the Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark offers social commentary and sympathizes with the victims of disaster and injustice. To Imlay, Wollstonecraft represents herself as laid low by doubts, but to the world she depicts herself as overcoming all of these fears. She ruminates on them and transforms them into {{the basis of a}} letter akin to the open political letter popular during {{the last quarter of the}} eighteenth century, using her personal experience as the foundation for a discussion of national political reform.|$|E
5|$|The high walk of crocodilians, {{with the}} belly {{and most of}} the tail being held off the ground, is unique among living reptiles. It {{somewhat}} resembles the walk of a mammal, with the same sequence of limb movements: left fore, right hind, right fore, left hind. The low walk is similar to the high walk, but without the body being raised, and <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sprawling walk of salamanders and lizards. The animal can change from one walk to the other instantaneously, but the high walk is the usual means of locomotion on land. The animal may push its body up and use this form immediately, or may take one or two strides of low walk before raising the body higher. Unlike most other land vertebrates, when crocodilians increase their pace of travel they increase the speed at which the lower half of each limb (rather than the whole leg) swings forward; by this means, stride length increases while stride duration decreases.|$|E

The White Knight uses two T-tails, but the White Knight Two uses two cruciform tails. Engine configuration {{is also very}} different. White Knight Two has four engines hung underneath the wings on pylons while White Knight's pair of engines are {{on either side of}} its single fuselage.|$|E

It has been found that HDAC11 remains mainly in the nucleus.|$|E

The spectrum also makes precise the intuition that localisation and factor rings are complementary: the natural maps R → R'f and R → R / fR correspond, after endowing the spectra of the rings in question with their Zariski topology, to complementary open and closed immersions respectively.

25|$|The Court {{proceeded}} {{to reject the}} {{clear and present danger}} test for the following reasons. To begin with, the test is linked to the United States' unique culture and constitutional position on freedom of speech, which does not represent the position in most Commonwealth jurisdictions and Singapore. In particular, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> corresponding provisions in the respective constitutions of Commonwealth jurisdictions. The Court cautioned that the United States approach should not be followed as it could result in possible abuse and negation of the right itself. Furthermore, the Court emphasized that the real risk test is already a weighty test which pays the correct attention to the balance between the right to freedom of speech and the possibility of its abuse.|$|E
25|$|Jung {{was one of}} {{the first}} people to define {{introversion}} and extraversion in a psychological context. In Jung’s Psychological Types, he theorizes that each person falls into one of two categories, the introvert and the extravert. These two psychological types Jung compares to ancient archetypes, Apollo and Dionysus. The introvert is likened with Apollo, who shines light on understanding. The introvert is focused on the internal world of reflection, dreaming and vision. Thoughtful and insightful, the introvert can sometimes be uninterested in joining the activities of others. The extravert is associated with Dionysus, interested in joining the activities of the world. The extravert is focused on the outside world of objects, sensory perception and action. Energetic and lively, the extrovert may lose their sense of self in the intoxication of Dionysian pursuits. Jungian introversion and extraversion <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> modern idea of introversion and extroversion. Modern theories often stay true to behaviourist means of describing such a trait (sociability, talkativeness, assertiveness etc.) whereas Jungian introversion and extraversion is expressed as a perspective: introverts interpret the world subjectively, whereas extraverts interpret the world objectively.|$|E

25|$|Capital {{intensive}} companies, {{particularly high}} tech companies, always {{need to raise}} high volumes of capital in their early stages. For this reason, the public market provided by the stock exchanges {{has been one of}} the most important funding sources for many capital intensive startups. After the 1990s and early-2000s hi-tech listed companies' boom and bust in the world's major stock exchanges, it has been much more demanding for the high-tech entrepreneur to take his/her company public, unless either the company already has products in the market and is generating sales and earnings, or the company has completed advanced promising clinical trials, earned potentially profitable patents or conducted market research which demonstrated very positive outcomes. This <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> situation of the 1990s to early-2000s period, when a number of companies (particularly Internet boom and biotechnology companies) went public in the most prominent stock exchanges around the world, in the total absence of sales, earnings and any well-documented promising outcome. Anyway, every year a number of companies, including unknown highly speculative and financially unpredictable hi-tech startups, are listed for the first time in all the major stock exchanges – there are even specialized entry markets for these kind of companies or stock indexes tracking their performance (examples include the Alternext, CAC Small, SDAX, TecDAX, or most of the third market good companies).|$|E
25|$|In {{the above}} models, the nucleons may occupy orbitals in pairs, due to being fermions, which allows to explain even/odd Z and N effects {{well-known}} from experiments. The exact nature and capacity of nuclear shells differs {{from those of}} electrons in atomic orbitals, primarily because the potential well in which the nucleons move (especially in larger nuclei) <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> central electromagnetic potential well which binds electrons in atoms. Some resemblance to atomic orbital models {{may be seen in}} a small atomic nucleus like that of helium-4, in which the two protons and two neutrons separately occupy 1s orbitals analogous to the 1s orbital for the two electrons in the helium atom, and achieve unusual stability for the same reason. Nuclei with 5 nucleons are all extremely unstable and short-lived, yet, helium-3, with 3 nucleons, is very stable even with lack of a closed 1s orbital shell. Another nucleus with 3 nucleons, the triton hydrogen-3 is unstable and will decay into helium-3 when isolated. Weak nuclear stability with 2 nucleons {NP} in the 1s orbital is found in the deuteron hydrogen-2, with only one nucleon in each of the proton and neutron potential wells. While each nucleon is a fermion, the {NP} deuteron is a boson and thus does not follow Pauli Exclusion for close packing within shells. Lithium-6 with 6 nucleons is highly stable without a closed second 1p shell orbital. For light nuclei with total nucleon numbers 1 to 6 only those with 5 do not show some evidence of stability. Observations of beta-stability of light nuclei outside closed shells indicate that nuclear stability is much more complex than simple closure of shell orbitals with magic numbers of protons and neutrons.|$|E

500|$|Stage two (self-interest driven) {{expresses the}} [...] "what's {{in it for}} me" [...] position, in which right {{behavior}} is defined by whatever the individual believes {{to be in their}} best interest but understood in a narrow way which does not consider one's reputation or relationships to groups of people. Stage two reasoning shows a limited interest in the needs of others, but only to a point where it might further the individual's own interests. As a result, concern for others is not based on loyalty or intrinsic respect, but rather a [...] "You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours" [...] mentality. The lack of a societal perspective in the pre-conventional level <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> social contract (stage five), as all actions at this stage have the purpose of serving the individual's own needs or interests.

500|$|The Gospel of Matthew {{begins with}} a {{genealogy}} of Jesus. At , the actual narrative of Christ's life starts. This [...] "second beginning" [...] to Matthew was given emphasis in many early Gospel Books, {{so much so that}} the two sections were often treated as separate works. The second beginning begins with the word Christ. The Greek letters chi and rho were normally used in mediaeval manuscripts to abbreviate the word Christ. In Insular Gospel Books, the initial Chi Rho monogram was enlarged and decorated. In the Book of Kells, this second beginning was given a decorative programme equal to those that preface the individual Gospels. Folio 32 verso has a miniature of Christ enthroned. (It has been argued that this miniature is one of the lost evangelist portraits. However, the iconography <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> extant portraits, and current scholarship accepts this identification and placement for this miniature.) Facing this miniature, on , is the only carpet page in the Book of Kells, which is rather anomalous; the Lindisfarne Gospels has five extant carpet pages and the Book of Durrow has six. The blank verso of folio 33 faces the single most lavish miniature of the early mediaeval period, the Book of Kells Chi Rho monogram, which serves as incipit for the narrative of the life of Christ.|$|E
