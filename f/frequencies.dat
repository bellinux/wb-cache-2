5|$|Distributed element {{filters are}} mostly used at <b>frequencies</b> above the VHF (Very High Frequency) band (30 to 300 MHz). At these <b>frequencies,</b> the {{physical}} length of passive components {{is a significant}} fraction of the wavelength of the operating frequency, and it becomes difficult to use the conventional lumped element model. The exact point at which distributed element modelling becomes necessary depends on the particular design under consideration. A common {{rule of thumb is}} to apply distributed element modelling when component dimensions are larger than 0.1λ. The increasing miniaturisation of electronics has meant that circuit designs are becoming ever smaller compared to λ. The <b>frequencies</b> beyond which a distributed element approach to filter design becomes necessary are becoming ever higher {{as a result of these}} advances. On the other hand, antenna structure dimensions are usually comparable to λ in all frequency bands and require the distributed element model.|$|E
5|$|Early filters {{utilised}} {{the phenomenon}} of resonance to filter signals. Although electrical resonance had been investigated by researchers from a very early stage, it was at first not widely understood by electrical engineers. Consequently, the much more familiar concept of acoustic resonance (which in turn, can be {{explained in terms of}} the even more familiar mechanical resonance) found its way into filter design ahead of electrical resonance. Resonance can be used to achieve a filtering effect because the resonant device will respond to <b>frequencies</b> at, or near, to the resonant frequency but will not respond to <b>frequencies</b> far from resonance. Hence <b>frequencies</b> far from resonance are filtered out from the output of the device.|$|E

In 15 bats the emitted sounds were electronically shifted in <b>frequency</b> and played back as artificial echoes. Upward <b>frequency</b> shifts were responded by a decrease of the emission <b>frequency.</b> This <b>frequency</b> compensation occurred at <b>frequency</b> shifts of up to 4400 Hz in all bats and up to 6000 ttz in a few bats. The <b>frequency</b> decrease in different bats over the whole compensation range was 50 - 300 tIz smaller than the <b>frequency</b> shifts in the echoes. The echoes, therefore, returned at a <b>frequency,</b> called the reference <b>frequency,</b> which was by this compensation offset higher than the resting <b>frequency.</b> The standard deviations of the emission <b>frequency</b> in compensating bats were only slightly larger than in roosting bats and the same in the whole compensation range. All bats started to compensate <b>frequency</b> shifts when they were slightly larger than the compensation offset. Downward <b>frequency</b> shifts were not responded by a change of the emission <b>frequency,</b> but the accuracy with which the emission <b>frequency</b> was kept decreased somewhat.

5|$|LC filters at low <b>frequencies</b> become awkward; the components, {{especially}} the inductors, become expensive, bulky, heavy, and non-ideal. Practical 1H inductors require many {{turns on a}} high-permeability core; that material will have high losses and stability issues (e.g., a large temperature coefficient). For applications such as a mains filters, the awkwardness must be tolerated. For low-level, low-frequency, applications, RC filters are possible, but they cannot implement filters with complex poles or zeros. If the application can use power, then amplifiers {{can be used to}} make RC active filters that can have complex poles and zeros. In the 1950s, Sallen–Key active RC filters were made with vacuum tube amplifiers; these filters replaced the bulky inductors with bulky and hot vacuum tubes. Transistors offered more power-efficient active filter designs. Later, inexpensive operational amplifiers enabled other active RC filter design topologies.

5|$|Optical {{heterodyne}} detection {{is an essential}} technique used in high-accuracy measurements of the <b>frequencies</b> of optical sources, {{as well as in}} the stabilization of their <b>frequencies.</b> Until a relatively few years ago, lengthy frequency chains were needed to connect the microwave frequency of a cesium or other atomic time source to optical <b>frequencies.</b> At each step of the chain, a frequency multiplier would be used to produce a harmonic of the frequency of that step, which would be compared by {{heterodyne detection}} with the next step (the output of a microwave source, far infrared laser, infrared laser, or visible laser). Each measurement of a single spectral line required several years of effort in the construction of a custom frequency chain. Currently, optical frequency combs have provided a much simpler method of measuring optical <b>frequencies.</b> If a mode-locked laser is modulated to form a train of pulses, its spectrum is seen to consist of the carrier frequency surrounded by a closely spaced comb of optical sideband <b>frequencies</b> with a spacing equal to the pulse repetition frequency (Fig.16). The pulse repetition frequency is locked to that of the frequency standard, and the <b>frequencies</b> of the comb elements at the red end of the spectrum are doubled and heterodyned with the <b>frequencies</b> of the comb elements at the blue end of the spectrum, thus allowing the comb to serve as its own reference. In this manner, locking of the frequency comb output to an atomic standard can be performed in a single step. To measure an unknown frequency, the frequency comb output is dispersed into a spectrum. The unknown frequency is overlapped with the appropriate spectral segment of the comb and the frequency of the resultant heterodyne beats is measured.|$|E
