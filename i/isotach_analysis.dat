40|$|The currently-used typhoon {{wind field}} models for wind {{resistance}} design of {{buildings and structures}} in typhoon regions often neglect the influence of temperature and assume that the central pressure difference does not vary with height above the ground. However, the observations made from field measurements and numerical simulations do not support this assumption. This paper thus presents a refined typhoon wind field model without this assumption and the decomposition method is then used to find the solution. The model is finally applied to Typhoon York. The wind speed and direction computed from the refined model are compared with those measured at the Waglan Island and the Di Wang Tower, and those predicted by the Meng model and the Shapiro model. The spatial distribution of wind speed in a horizontal plane is given through an <b>isotach</b> <b>analysis</b> and compared with the visual imagery of Typhoon York. Mean wind profiles at different distances from the typhoon center are also computed and compared with the field data and the power law profiles. The results demonstrate that the refined model gives more accurate wind speed, direction and profile than other models. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E
