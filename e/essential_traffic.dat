40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a programmable context-aware voice (CAV) service, which enables VoIP services to cope in crisis situations. To prevent the upsurge in traffic normally {{associated with a}} crisis from degrading the quality of service for privileged users like emergency workers, the CAV service prevents nonprivileged users from accessing the network during a crisis. This service is built upon the CONTEXT platform, an innovative middleware designed for the creation, deployment and management of context-aware services. The platform consists of a programmable layer, a context-aware service engine and a policy-based service layer. The voice services in the CAV are provided by a session initiation protocol (SIP) platform called Siptrex. The result is an easily customised, flexible and scalable context-ware service, which suppresses, non-essential traffic during crisis situations allowing greater bandwidth for <b>essential</b> <b>traffic.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|The {{integration}} {{of information and}} communications technologies across existing transportation infrastructure, systems and vehicles is fundamental to reducing traffic congestion, to improving driver safety, and to improving traveler experiences. Central to such intelligent traffic management are techniques and algorithms {{that are capable of}} analyzing the wealth of available contextual sensor data in ?real time?. Initial existing approaches tend to apply probability models and inference techniques to optimize traffic flow but fail to take into account certain aspects of human behavior that can affect the flow of traffic, such as patterns in human travel behavior. In this paper we explore how vehicle context information can be combined with the behavioral patterns of travelers to facilitate and improve intelligent traffic management. We present services for deriving reports on vehicle journeys that assist in the analysis of route performance, for enabling passengers to have remote access to real-time route performance information, and for the observation, learning, and utilization of human travel behavior patterns.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study and analyze the <b>essential</b> <b>traffic</b> {{characteristics}} of a 5. 4 -mile stretch of I- 64 - 40 located within the St. Louis metropolitan area. The freeway experiences heavy congestion during peak periods attributed to factors such as exceedingly high traf-fic volume, conflicting merging and diverging movements, multiple weaving areas, and overall poor geometric design. The freeway vol-ume, speed, and density data were collected on various locations within the study area and the data was translated into a series of graphics in-cluding, a speed-volume-time of day chart, a speed-volume chart, a volume-density chart, and a speed-density chart. The numerical result indicated that the capacity, free flow speeds, and critical speeds varied for different lanes. However, it was observed that the critical densities were relatively similar for all lanes at the same location. This indicates that density may be a rather important and more reliable measure than volume and speed in the determination of freeway capacity. This study provides a better understanding of the freeway dynamics. In addition, it forms a comprehensive database for the development and implemen-tation of congestion management techniques utilizing Intelligent Trans-portation System (ITS).

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} the author's stochastic model of bus line operation, {{taking into account}} the variability of traffic conditions, as a result of disturbing factors. General structure of the model bases on graph and events theory. In this approach, bus line has been described by bus stops and sections between these stops, and the most <b>essential</b> <b>traffic</b> processes: running following sections, alighting and boarding passengers at bus stops, waiting for the possibility to departure. In the mathematical description of the simulation model, a dynamical system of matrix-vector equations is used. The fundamental element of presented model is the state vector of the system. It includes all important information about operation of each bus line: variables allowing to define location of each bus on a line in time and space, variables describing the occupancy of all buses and values of scheduled ride times which enable to evaluate punctuality. All parameters of the model have been determined with statistical and stochastic methods using, on the basis of extensive and identification own research including various types of sections (with or without separated bus lanes) and diversified location and types of bus stops. Presented simulation model can find wide application among others: to create feasibility studies for investments in public transport, evaluation of solutions streamlining bus traffic, planning bus routes and developing timetables.

40|$|Dendritic cells (DCs) {{are crucial}} {{participants}} in maintaining immune surveillance of the periphery and initiating primary immune responses within the draining lymph nodes. The afferent lymphatic vessels provide {{a conduit for}} this <b>essential</b> <b>trafficking</b> and, as this review will describe, {{play an active role}} in regulating DC migration. Afferent lymphatic capillaries support constitutive trafficking of DCs from resting, non-inflamed tissue, to maintain tolerance against self-antigen and to provide immune surveillance. Following exposure to pathogens or pro-inflammatory cytokines, DCs mature from phagocytes to professional antigen-presenting cells, whilst the lymphatic endothelium adopts an activated phenotype to support the ensuing increase in leukocyte trafficking. The lymphatic endothelial-derived chemokine CCL 21 plays a well-characterized role in directing migration of CCR 7 + DC in both resting and acute inflammatory conditions. However, efficient trafficking of DCs from inflamed tissue also demands additional chemokine-receptor pairs. Thus, entry of DCs to activated lymphatic vessels is an intricately regulated multi-step process involving numerous chemokines and adhesion molecules. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|R
40|$|Coordinated, {{subcellular}} trafficking {{of proteins}} {{is one of}} the fundamental properties of the multicellular eukaryotic organisms. Trafficking involves a large diversity of compartments, pathways, cargo molecules and vesicle-sorting events. It is also crucial in regulating the localization and, thus, the activity of various proteins, but the process is still poorly genetically deﬁned in plants. In the past, forward genetics screens had been used to determine the function of genes by searching for a specific morphological phenotype in the organism population in which mutations had been induced chemically or by irradiation. Unfortunately, these straightforward genetic screens turned out to be limited in identifying new regulators of intracellular protein transport, because mutations affecting <b>essential</b> <b>trafficking</b> pathways often lead to lethality. In addition, the use of these approaches has been restricted by functional redundancy among trafficking regulators. Screens for mutants that rely on the observation of changes in the cellular localization or dynamics of fluorescent subcellular markers enable, at least partially, to circumvent these issues. Hence, such image-based screens provide the possibility to identify either alleles with weak effects or components of the subcellular trafficking machinery that have no strong impact on the plant growth...|$|R
30|$|Traditionally, mobile {{operators}} {{paid their}} attention {{in providing a}} good quality of the voice service, since it was the main offered service. To ensure this Quality-of-Service (QoS), troubleshooting experts mainly monitored the call blocking and dropping rates at the cell level to measure the levels of accesibility and retainability, respectively, in the network. However, with the explosion of Internet services, the QoS of multimedia and data applications is given by the data rates experienced by the users, where integrity metrics such as throughput and latency are <b>essential</b> <b>traffic</b> measurements [4]. The problem of throughput performance indicators {{is that they are}} often difficult to interpret because of their dependence on many factors. In particular, there are some aspects beyond the typical variables related to the radio environment (e.g., distance to base station, cell loading, user speed, etc.) that should be considered. First, unlike in traditional voice services, the mobile network is only one segment of the end-to-end connection in an IP world. For example, a router in the IP cloud that suffers congestion may influence the user perceived data rate. Second, the recent radio access technologies (RATs) such as Long-Term-Evolution (LTE) have included a class-based QoS model as a mechanism to differentiate between services, establishing various levels of service to the users. Third, the traffic pattern of new data services clearly impacts throughput measurements. Due to the increasing popularity of web navigation, streaming video, social networking, file sharing, online gaming, and other data services, there are significant differences in traffic patterns [6]. As a consequence, operators are investing a large amount of money to investigate traffic modeling and classification through packet inspection in order to better understand the characteristic of today’s cellular data traffic. In addition, sophisticated traffic data filtering, processing, and correlation with other network metrics are also important features to identify root causes of any detected anomaly and increase the reliability of the network [7, 8].|$|E
40|$|Fet 3 p is a multicopper-containing {{glycoprotein}} localized to {{the yeast}} plasma membrane that catalyzes the oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III). This ferrous iron oxidation is coupled to {{the reduction of}} O 2 to H 2 O and is termed the ferroxidase reaction. Fet 3 p-produced Fe(III) is transferred to the permease Ftr 1 p for import into the cytosol. The posttranslational insertion of four copper ions into Fet 3 p is essential for its activity, thus linking copper and iron homeostasis. The mammalian ferroxidases ceruloplasmin and hephaestin are homologs of Fet 3 p. Loss of the Fe(II) oxidation catalyzed by these proteins results in a spectrum of pathological states, including death. Here, we present {{the structure of the}} Fet 3 p extracellular ferroxidase domain and compare it with that of human ceruloplasmin and other multicopper oxidases that are devoid of ferroxidase activity.

40|$|The role(s) of {{the newly}} {{discovered}} stargazin-like γ-subunit proteins remains unclear; although they are now widely accepted to be transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs), rather than Ca 2 + channel subunits, {{it is possible that}} they have more general roles in trafficking within neurons. We previously found that γ 7 subunit is associated with vesicles when it is expressed in neurons and other cells. Here, we show that γ 7 is present mainly in retrogradely transported organelles in sympathetic neurons, where it colocalises with TrkA–YFP, and with the early endosome marker EEA 1, suggesting that γ 7 localises to signalling endosomes. It was not found to colocalise with markers of the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, lysosomes or late endosomes. Furthermore, knockdown of endogenous γ 7 by short hairpin RNA transfection into sympathetic neurons reduced neurite outgrowth. The same was true in the PC 12 neuronal cell line, where neurite outgrowth was restored by overexpression of human γ 7. These findings open the possibility that γ 7 has an <b>essential</b> <b>trafficking</b> role in relation to neurite outgrowth as a component of endosomes involved in neurite extension and growth cone remodelling...|$|R

40|$|SURFIN(4. 2) is a parasite-infected {{red blood}} cell (iRBC) surface {{associated}} protein of Plasmodium falciparum. To analyze the region responsible for the intracellular trafficking of SURFIN(4. 2) to the iRBC and Maurer's clefts, a panel of transgenic parasite lines expressing recombinant SURFIN(4. 2) fused with green fluorescent protein was generated and evaluated for their localization. We found that the cytoplasmic region containing a tryptophan rich (WR) domain is not necessary for trafficking, whereas the transmembrane (TM) region was. Two PEXEL-like sequences were shown not {{to be responsible for}} the trafficking of SURFIN(4. 2), demonstrating that the protein is trafficked in a PEXEL-independent manner. N-terminal replacement, deletion of the cysteine-rich domain or the variable region also did not prevent the protein from localizing at the iRBC or Maurer's clefts. A recombinant SURFIN(4. 2) protein possessing 50 amino acids upstream of the TM region, TM region itself and a part of the cytoplasmic region was shown to be trafficked into the iRBC and Maurer's clefts, suggesting that there are no <b>essential</b> <b>trafficking</b> motifs in the SURFIN(4. 2) extracellular region. A mini-SURFIN(4. 2) protein containing WR domain was shown by Western blotting to be more abundantly detected in a Triton X- 100 -insoluble fraction, compared to the one without WR domain.

The intracellular proteins MMACHC and MMADHC play important roles in processing and targeting the Cbl cofactor to its destination enzymes, and recent evidence suggests that they may interact while performing these <b>essential</b> <b>trafficking</b> functions. To better understand the molecular basis of this interaction, we have mapped the crucial protein regions required, indicate that Cbl is likely processed by MMACHC prior to interaction with MMADHC, and identify patient mutations on both proteins that interfere with complex formation, via different mechanisms. We further report the crystal structure of the MMADHC C-terminal region at 2. 2 Å resolution, revealing a modified nitroreductase fold with surprising homology to MMACHC despite their poor sequence conservation. Because MMADHC demonstrates no known enzymatic activity, we propose it as the first protein known to repurpose the nitroreductase fold solely for protein-protein interaction. Using small angle x-ray scattering, we reveal the MMACHC-MMADHC complex as a 1 : 1 heterodimer and provide a structural model of this interaction, where the interaction region overlaps with the MMACHC-Cbl binding site. Together, our findings provide novel structural evidence and mechanistic insight into an essential biological process, whereby an intracellular "trafficking chaperone" highly specific for a trace element cofactor functions via protein-protein interaction, which is disrupted by inherited disease mutations...|$|R
