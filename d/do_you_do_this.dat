6000|$|After {{they were}} gone, a queer, gaunt man came and glanced {{from the doorway}} at her. He had one eye in unnatural fixity, and the other set at that {{abnormal}} slant which is said to qualify the owner for looking round a corner before he gets to it. A droll twist of his mouth seemed partly physical, but: {{there is no doubt}} that he had often a humorous intention. It was Barlow, the man-of-all-work, who killed and plucked the poultry, peeled the potatoes and picked the peas, pulled the sweet-corn and the tomatoes, kindled the kitchen fire, harnessed the old splayfooted mare,--safe for ladies and children, and intolerable for all others, which formed the entire stud of the Jocelyn House stables,--dug the clams, rowed and sailed the boat, looked after the bath-houses, and came in contact with the guests at so many points that he was on easy terms with them all. This ease tended to an intimacy which he was himself powerless to repress, and which, from time to time, required their intervention. He now wore a simple costume of shirt and trousers, the latter terminated by a pair of broken shoes, and sustained by what he called a single gallows; his broad-brimmed straw hat scooped down upon his shoulders behind, and in front added to his congenital difficulty of getting people in focus. [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>this</b> morning, Mrs. Maynard?" [...] he said.|$|E

40|$|Physical puzzles {{that can}} be solved with methods for {{permutation}} groups are considered and classified according {{to a number of}} abstract properties. The approach for solution is based on word stabilizer chains (the transversal elements are factored in words in a given list of generators). New methods are presented to construct word stabilizer chains that take advantage of the special structures present in physical puzzles. In many cases the methods are successful in avoiding the exponential growth of word length that plagues stabilizer chain methods to construct transversal elements. Finally, a classification scheme for puzzles is presented which helps with finding the permutation group related to the puzzle. 1 Introduction It is a well known fact that Rubik's Cube can be solved with algorithms for permutation groups. But how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> efficiently? In fact, it is essential to produce a solution with as few moves as possible. This paper focuses on puzzles where permutation group m [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This {{workshop}} {{is based}} on the proposition that concern conflicts can be powerful starting points for user-centered design processes. Concern conflicts arise when the user wants to simultaneously fulfill two concerns that require mutually exclusive choice alternatives. Imagine your alarm clock ringing in the morning. You need to attend an early morning meeting that is important for your work (concern for competence), but you also want to stay in bed to relax {{for as long as you}} can since you could not get enough sleep (concern for relaxation). What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do?</b> <b>This</b> is a typical example of an experience that involves a concern conflict, i. e. a dilemma. Dilemmas are pervasive in everyday life, and thus, they are a crucial part of every design context. The way designers formulate and address users’ dilemmas can lead to creation of different product identities ranging from user-friendly products to products that promote social responsibility. In this workshop, participants will have the opportunity to explore different types of dilemmas and to create design concepts using new design tools and techniques.

40|$|In the {{cognitive}} psychology of human reasoning the belief revision paradigm (Elio & Pelletier, 1997) deals with how people accommodate new information that contradicts previous inferences/beliefs. Let us assume for instance {{that you believe}} that ‘if an animal is a bird, it can fly ’ and that we tell you that Tweety is a bird. You will now most likely have the expectation that Tweety can fly. This expectation follows a so-called Modus Ponendo Ponens (MPP) argument: [if p then q], [p], therefore [q]. Now imagine that we tell you that Tweety is an ostrich and cannot fly: [not-q]. If you accept this new information, you have to alter your belief in {{one or both of}} the propositions hitherto accepted as true. Which premise do you revise and how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>this?</b> Belief revision studies also confront reasoners with so-called Modus Tollendo Tollens arguments (MTT) : [if p then q], [not-q], therefore [not-p], which is contradicted by a new belief [p]. A comparison with MPP has shown that the initial logical structure of a defeated argument affects the belief revision process: There exist ‘inference contradiction effects ’ (ICEs: computed as the difference between rejection rates of the major premise in MPP versu...|$|E
