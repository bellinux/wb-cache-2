40|$|This {{contribution}} {{introduces the}} basic techniques for digital facial <b>engraving,</b> which imitates traditional copperplate <b>engraving.</b> Inspired by traditional techniques, we first establish {{a set of}} basic rules thanks to which separate <b>engraving</b> layers are built {{on the top of}} the original photo. Separate layers are merged according to simple merging rules and according to range shift/scale masks specially introduced for this purpose. We illustrate the introduced technique by a set of black/white and color engravings, showing different features such as engraving-specific image enhancements, mixing different regular <b>engraving</b> lines with mezzotint, irregular perturbations of <b>engraving</b> lines etc. We introduce the notion of <b>engraving</b> style which comprises a set of separate <b>engraving</b> layers together with a set of associated range shift/scale masks. The <b>engraving</b> style helps to port the look and feel of one <b>engraving</b> to another. Once different libraries of pre-defined mappable <b>engraving</b> styles and an appropriate user interface are added to the basic system, producing a decent gravure starting from a simple digital photo will be a matter of seconds. The <b>engraving</b> technique described in this contribution opens new perspectives for digital art, adding unprecedented power and precision to the engraver’s work...|$|R
