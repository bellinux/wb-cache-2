50|$|However, {{the cost}} of {{implementation}} was high; computers output raw PS code that would be interpreted by the printer into a raster image at the printer's natural resolution. This required high performance microprocessors and ample memory. The LaserWriter used a 12 MHz Motorola 68000, making it faster {{than any of the}} Macintosh computers to which it attached. When the laser printer engines themselves cost over a thousand dollars the added cost of PS was marginal. But as printer mechanisms fell in price, {{the cost of}} implementing PS became too great a fraction of overall printer cost; in addition, with desktop computers becoming more powerful, it no longer made sense to offload the rasterisation work onto the resource-constrained printer. By 2001, few lower-end printer models came with support for PostScript, largely due to growing competition from much cheaper non-PostScript ink jet printers, and new software-based methods to render PostScript images on the computer, making them suitable for any printer; PDF, a descendant of PostScript, provides one such method, and has largely replaced PostScript as de facto standard for electronic <b>document</b> <b>distribution.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Peer-to-peer (P 2 P) {{networking}} continuously gains {{popularity among}} computing science researchers. The problem of information retrieval (IR) over P 2 P networks is being addressed by researchers attempting to provide valuable insight {{as well as}} solutions for its successful deployment. All published studies have, so far, been evaluated by simulation means, using well-known document collections (usually acquired from TREC). Researchers test their systems using divided collections whose documents have been previously distributed {{to a number of}} simulated peers. This practice leads to two problems: First, there is little justification in favour of the <b>document</b> <b>distributions</b> used by relevant studies and second, since different studies use different experimental testbeds, there is no common ground for comparing the solutions proposed. In this work, we contribute a number of different document testbeds for evaluating P 2 P IR systems. Each of these has been deduced from TREC’s WT 10 g collection and corresponds to different potential P 2 P IR application scenarios. We analyse each methodology and testbed with respect to the <b>document</b> <b>distributions</b> achieved {{as well as to the}} location of relevant items within each setting. This work marks the beginning of an effort to provide more realistic evaluation environments for P 2 P IR systems as well as to create a common ground for comparisons of existing and future architectures. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{method of}} {{simulating}} distributed search engines is presented. This method measures throughput (queries per second) and resource usage.

This goes against the accepted view that <b>document</b> <b>distribution</b> is faster than term distribution. We introduced a hybrid distribution scheme that splits a set of machines and disks into groups and then performs term distribution within a group and <b>document</b> <b>distribution</b> between groups. Our simulation results show that this hybrid distribution scheme has higher throughput rates than <b>document</b> <b>distribution,</b> but can still scale to large numbers of machines. A special case of our hybrid distribution scheme groups together multiple disks on a machine to produce better throughput without increasing network traffic.

40|$|Digital {{watermarking}} is {{a promising}} technology to embed copyright information as unperceivable signals in digital contents. Although various watermarking techniques have been employed extensively for protecting rights of multimedia digital contents over the Internet, their {{applications in the}} management of enterprise documents have not been studied comprehensively. In this paper, we present a novel watermark-based <b>document</b> <b>distribution</b> protocol, which complements conventional access control techniques, to address a common problem in large enterprises, where document management policies are not properly reinforced. For instance, sensitive documents are often left behind in common areas, printing rooms or public folders in an enterprise. The reinforcement of document management policies requires a concrete support of non-repudiation in the <b>document</b> <b>distribution</b> protocol. The protocol is adapted from our previous works on watermarking protocols, which defend unethical distribution of digital contents over the Internet. Our protocol makes use of registration certificates to distribute the identity information of the content end users.

40|$|A {{geographically}} distributed {{web server}} (GDWS) system, consisting of multiple server nodes interconnected by a MAN or a WAN, can achieve better efficiency in handling the ever-increasing web requests than centralized web servers {{because of the}} proximity of server nodes to clients. It is also more scalable since the throughput will not be limited by available bandwidth connecting to a central server. The key research issue {{in the design of}} GDWS is how to replicate and distribute the documents of a web site among the server nodes. This paper proposes a density-based replication scheme and applies it to our proposed Extensible GDWS (EGDWS) architecture. Its <b>document</b> <b>distribution</b> scheme supports partial replication targeting only at hot objects among the documents. To distribute the replicas generated via the density-based replication scheme, we propose four different <b>document</b> <b>distribution</b> algorithms: Greedy-cost, Maximal-density, Greedypenalty, and Proximity-aware. A proximity-based routing mechanism is designed to incorporate these algorithms for achieving better web server performance in a WAN environment. Simulation results show that our document replication and distribution algorithms achieve better response times and load balancing than existing dynamic schemes. To further reduce user's response time, we propose two document grouping algorithms that can cut down on the request redirection overheads...|$|E
