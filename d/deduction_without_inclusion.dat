40|$|The {{effect of}} plasma inertia on {{vertical}} displacement instability (VDI) is investigated in both linear and nonlinear regimes. In a linear case, {{the solution of}} the dispersion shows the existance of a critical elongation for a certain distance of the conducting wall. In the nonlinear case a difference between the cases with and <b>without</b> <b>inclusion</b> of plasma inertia is found. The inclusion of the plasma inertia leads to a ""softening"" of the critical behavior of the displacement against the distance of the resistive wall. <b>Without</b> <b>inclusion</b> of plasma inertia there exists a critical distance between the wall and the plasma below which VDI can not be stabilized no matter how the parameters in feedback controlling scheme are set. An analysis of the dispersion of linear VDI shows that the plasma inertia {{plays an important role in}} the properties of the solutions of dispersion and hence in the behavior of VDI. ...|$|R

All markers displayed significant differential expression among the subtypes (p[*] 0. 1; in case of papillary RCC LR+ rose beyond 10, but LR- remained > 0. 1.
