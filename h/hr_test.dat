In 900 scrapings of women with normal cytomorphology, specificity was 90 % (95 %CI: 87. 84 – 91. 87) for the Cervista HPV <b>HR</b> <b>test</b> and 96 % (95 %CI: 94. 76 – 97. 37) for the HC 2 test with 93 % agreement between both tests (k = 0. 5, p, 0. 001). The sensitivity for CIN 2 + using 65 scrapings of women with histological-confirmed CIN 2 + was 91 % (95 %CI: 80. 97 – 96. 51) for the Cervista HPV <b>HR</b> <b>test</b> and 92 % (95 %CI: 82. 94 – 97. 43) for the HC 2 test with 95 % agreement between both tests (k = 0. 7, p, 0. 001). Fifty-seven of 60 HC 2 negative/Cervista positive cases tested HPV-negative with PCR-based HPV assays; of these cases 56 % were defined as Cervista triple-positive with FOZ values in all 3 mixes higher than the second cut-off of 1. 93 (as set by manufacturer). By setting this cut-off at 5. 0, specificity improved significantly without affecting sensitivity. External validation of this new cut-off at 5. 0 in triple-positive scrapings of women selected from the SHENCCASTII database revealed that 22 / 24 histological normal cases now tested HPV-negative in the Cervista HPV <b>HR</b> <b>test,</b> while CIN 2 + lesions remained HPV-positive.

40|$|In {{comparing}} two treatments {{with the}} event time observations, the hazard ratio (HR) estimate is routinely used {{to quantify the}} treatment difference. However, this model dependent estimate {{may be difficult to}} interpret clinically especially when the proportional hazards (PH) assumption is violated. An alternative estimation procedure for treatment efficacy based on the restricted means survival time or t-year mean survival time (t-MST) has been discussed extensively in the statistical and clinical literature. On the other hand, a statistical test 1 via the HR or its asymptotically equivalent counterpart, the logrank test, is asymptotically distribution-free. In this paper, we assess the relative efficiency of the hazard ratio and t-MST tests with respect to the statistical power using various PH and non-PH models under theoretical and practical settings. When the PH assumption is valid, the t-MST test performs almost as well as the <b>HR</b> <b>test.</b> For non-PH models, the t-MST test can substantially outperform its HR counter- part. On the other hand, the <b>HR</b> <b>test</b> can be powerful when the true difference of two survival functions is quite large at end of the study.

When damage to dormant stems in a 24 -hr test {{was assessed by}} either a graded damage scale or percentage consumption by weight, pine voles preferred Golden Delicious, M. 9, and M. 26 and consistently avoided M. x sublobata PI 286613 (2 ̆ 26132 ̆ 2) and related clones and Robusta 5. Dehydrating stems magnified the disparity among cultivars, as attractive stems continued to suffer extensive damage, while 613 became even less palatable. In the autumn phase all varieties showed increased acceptance. Meadow voles, like pine voles, exhibited differential acceptance of cultivars, but their preferences differed somewhat from pine voles in that they extensively damaged Robusta 5. When bark and pulp portions of rootstocks were separately presented to pine voles in 1 <b>hr</b> <b>tests,</b> weight consumed followed expected varietal preferences. With dormant stocks, significantly more bark was consumed than pulp in both 613 and Golden Delicious samples, and, in both fractions Golden Delicious was consumed more than 613. In autumn-cut stocks Golden Delicious was preferred to three other varieties overall, as was its pulp fraction. Humans readily detected textural contrasts among rootstocks, some {{of which can be}} measured during the dormant phase as lower densities and higher water content for the extremely preferred rootstocks. Humans also reported taste differences among cultivars, describing rootstocks and fragments as bitter more often for Golden Delicious and 613 than for Robusta 5 and M. 9. Taken together, these rootstock data suggest that stem texture may be a primary factor for rootstock acceptability. Taste probably also plays a role in rootstock preferences.

Patients and Methods: Fifty-five patients with a cytological diagnosis of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions were triaged with a standard colposcopy. Hormonal replacement therapy was considered as significative in influencing cervical trophism. Vaginal smears for microbiological examination were obtained. H-R HPV test was performed by PCR. The follow-up checks including cytology, colposcopy and HVP test were performed for a minimum of 5 years. Results: Histological analysis revealed 19 CIN 2 (cervical intraepithelial lesions) and 36 CIN 3 lesions. The cumulative failure rate at first treatment was 14 %. HPV test was positive for HPV 16 type in all patients. Forty-two patients during the follow up checks resulted negative to cytology, colposcopy and <b>HR</b> HPV <b>test.</b> At the one-year follow-up check, 7 patients revealed normal cytological and abnormal colposcopical findings and persistent positive <b>HR</b> HPV <b>test.</b> At the five-year follow-up check, 14 patients with a normal cytological smear had a recurrence of CIN 2 / 3 and positive <b>HR</b> HPV <b>test.</b> Conclusion: In postmenopause, the correct management of H-R squamous intraepithelial lesions is still debated.

It has been shown the differences in wear between composite and base cast steel. The Miller slurry machine test {{were used to determine}} wear loss of the specimens. The slurry was composed of SiC and water. The worn surface of specimens after test, were studied by SEM. Experimental observation has shown that surface of composite zone is not homogenous and consist the matrix lakes. Microscopic observations revealed the long grooves with SiC particles indented in the base alloy area, and spalling pits in the composite area. Due to the presence of TiC carbides on composite layer, specimens with TiC reinforced cast steel exhibited higher abrasion resistance. The wear of TiC reinforced cast steel mechanism was initially by wearing of soft matrix and in second stage by polishing and spalling of TiC. Summary weight loss after 16 <b>hr</b> <b>test</b> was 0, 14 ÷ 0, 23 g for composite specimens and 0, 90 g for base steel...|$|E
50|$|Neodymium(III) {{chloride}} {{does not}} seem toxic to humans and animals (approximately similar to table salt). The LD50 (dose at which there is 50% mortality) for animals is about 3.7 g per kg of body weight (mouse, oral), 0.15 g/kg (rabbit, intravenous injection). Mild irritation of skin occurs upon exposure with 500 mg during 24 <b>hrs</b> (Draize <b>test</b> on rabbits). Substances with LD50 above 2 g/kg are considered non-toxic.|$|R
40|$|Attempting to {{retrieve}} information from memory enhances subsequent learning {{even if the}} retrieval attempt is unsuccessful. Recent evidence suggests that this benefit materializes only if subsequent study occurs immediately after the retrieval attempt. Previous studies have prompted retrieval using a cue (e. g., whale–???) that has no intrinsic answer. Experiment 1 replicated prior word pair studies, but in Experiment 2, when participants learned meaningful trivia questions, testing enhanced learning even when subsequent study was delayed. Even in Experiment 3, when subsequent study was delayed by up to 24 <b>hr,</b> <b>tests</b> enhanced learning on a final <b>test</b> another 24 <b>hr</b> later. These findings may give comfort to educators who worry that asking a question or giving a test, on which students inevitably make mistakes, impairs learning if feedback is not immediate. They also {{suggest that there is}} a consensus in the literature thus far: Questions with rich semantic content enhance subsequent learning even when feedback is delayed, but less meaningful questions without an intrinsic answer enhance learning only when feedback is immediate...|$|R
40|$|This {{test method}} {{describes}} the procedure used {{for determining the}} flexural strength or modulus of rupture of Rapid Strength Concrete (RSC) {{by the use of}} a simple beam with third point loading. Rapid Strength Concrete is used on projects where short construction windows (6 hr to 55 hr) require rapid curing (typically 3 hr to 24 <b>hr).</b> This <b>test</b> method is typically used to fabricate and test samples at the jobsite to meet traffic-opening criterion...|$|R
