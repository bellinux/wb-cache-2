50|$|Campania and Lucania had {{the largest}} triple {{expansion}} engines ever fitted to a Cunard ship. These engines were also {{the largest in the}} world at the time, and still rank today amongst the largest of the type ever constructed. They represent the limits of development for this kind of technology, which was superseded a few years later by turbine technology. In height, the engines were 47 feet, reaching from the double-bottom floor of the engine room almost {{to the top of the}} superstructure - over five decks. Each engine had five cylinders. There were two high pressure cylinders, each measuring 37 in in diameter; one <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinder</b> measuring 79 inin diameter; and two low pressure cylinders, each measuring 98 in in diameter. They operated with a stroke of 69 in. Steam was raised from 12 double-end scotch boilers, each measuring 18 ft in diameter and having eight furnaces. There was also one single-ended boiler for auxiliary machinery and one, smaller donkey boiler. Boiler pressure was 165 lbs, and enabled the engines to produce , which translated to an average speed of 22 kn, and a record speed of 23½ knots. Normal operating speed for the engines was about 79 rpm.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{provides}} a comprehensive scheme for {{assessment of the}} residual service life and extension of operating life of steam turbine rotors with expired fleet service life. The residual service life of high temperature rotors for high & <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> of К- 200 - 130 - 3 steam turbine without heat grooves calculated and it was showed that the residual service life of high & <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressure</b> rotors without grooves has been extended {{as compared to the}} К- 200 - 130 - 1 turbine rotors with grooves. Also residual life management by supplying hot steam to the HPC and IPC seals was investigated and it was noted their significant impact on the residual service life...|$|R
50|$|By 1897, {{additional}} {{pumping capacity}} was needed, and four extra pumps operated by triple-expansion steam engines were installed in an extension, {{designed to fit}} in with Bazalgette's main engine house, {{to the north of the}} older building. Later, in 1899, a further increase in London's population necessitated an increase in the efficiency of the original Watt engines, and considerable alteration to their design was carried out by Goodfellow and Co of Hyde, Manchester, for London County Council. They were converted from simple to compound engines with the original single cylinders were augmented by high and <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders.</b> The additional steam required was provided by replacing the earlier Cornish boilers by more efficient Lancashire boilers with double flues and in 1901 the improved engines were fully working.|$|R
50|$|On 7 September 1893, one of J & E Woods 1892 {{engines in}} Mutual Mills, Rochdale was {{extensively}} tested by Mr J L F Crosland {{and the results}} published. The engines were triple expansion with four cylinders arranged in a horizontal double tandem formation. The high <b>pressure</b> (HP) <b>cylinder</b> had a bore of 21 in, the <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressure</b> (IP) <b>cylinder</b> had a bore of 33 in and the two low <b>pressure</b> (LP) <b>cylinders</b> 35 in. The stroke was 6 ft and the engine operated at 53 rpm. The engines were fitted with Corliss valves operated by a simple proprietary trip motion. The piston rods for the HP and IP are 4.75 in and 5.25 in. During the test, the two 30 ft by 8 ft Lancashire boilers with 3 ft 2 in diameter flues produced steam at 156 psi. There were Galloway tubes in the flues and behind the boilers was an economiser with 288 pipes. Water was delivered to the boilers at 304 F. The boilers were fed by mechanical stokers using coal known as Shaw slack with a calorific value of 12,963 Btu/lb. During two days of testing the engine developed power of 1089.7 and 1049.4. The power developed on {{the two sides of}} the engine was balanced being 542.2 IHP and 547.5 IHP. On the two days 1.37 lb/IHP hr and 1.38 lb/IHP hr. Taking into account that coal could be bought at 6s/ton- this means that 1d would buy 23.1 IHP hrs or 5544 IHP hrs per pound sterling. For a thermal efficiency point of view, of the 14935 Btu of heat supplied, 2595 Btus were converted into mechanical work. This is an efficiency of 0.172 while a perfect engine gives 0.279, so the engine has a relative efficiency of 0.616. This is taken as the reference standard for an engine of this configuration.|$|R
40|$|Natural gas {{combined}} cycle (NGCC) power plants fitted with {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) technologies {{are projected to}} operate as mid-merit plants in the future of the decarbonised energy market. This projection stems from an inherent characteristic of the NGCC plants of being flexible in operation and able to rapidly change their output power. Therefore, it is expected that the NGCC-CCS plants will continue to operate flexibly for a range of operational loads; and therefore compliment the intermittent electricity generation of other low carbon plants to securely maintain the quality of electricity supply. This study aims to evaluate the performance of a triple pressure NGCC power plant fitted with a post combustion CO 2 capture plant (PCC) at power plant part loads, and assess the effect of the temporary shutdown of the PCC plant. Steady state simulations of the integrated plant at part loads were performed, as well as the integrated plant in non-capture operating mode. These demonstrated that the PCC steady state performance is viable at part loads down to 60 %. However, operation in non-capture mode revealed a negative impact on the steam turbine performance, especially on the low <b>pressure</b> (LP) and <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressure</b> (IP) <b>cylinders,</b> as well as the cold end. Suggesting that it is not beneficial to operate in the non-capture mode, regardless of inevitable situations where the PCC or the CO 2 compression unit trip...|$|R
25|$|Most {{regulators}} have two stages. The first stage is a fixed-pressure regulator, which releases {{gas from the}} cylinder at a constant <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressure,</b> despite the <b>pressure</b> in the <b>cylinder</b> falling as the gas in it is consumed. This {{is similar to the}} first stage of a scuba-diving regulator. The adjustable second stage of the regulator controls the pressure reduction from the <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressure</b> to the low outlet pressure. The regulator has two pressure gauges, one indicating <b>cylinder</b> <b>pressure,</b> the other indicating hose pressure. The adjustment knob of the regulator is sometimes roughly calibrated for pressure, but an accurate setting requires observation of the gauge.|$|R
50|$|Oxy-fuel welding {{and cutting}} {{processes}} require gases at specific pressures, and regulators will generally {{be used to}} reduce the high <b>pressures</b> of storage <b>cylinders</b> to those usable for cutting and welding. Oxy-gas regulators usually have two stages: The first stage of the regulator releases the gas at a constant rate from the <b>cylinder</b> despite the <b>pressure</b> in the <b>cylinder</b> becoming less as the gas is released. The second stage of the regulator controls the pressure reduction from the <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressure</b> to low pressure. It is constant flow. The valve assembly has two pressure gauges, one indicating <b>cylinder</b> <b>pressure,</b> the other indicating hose pressure.|$|R

50|$|Number 7 {{was built}} in 1886 at Swindon as a tandem {{compound}} 2-4-0 with 7 ft coupled wheels and outside frames. The 23 in diameter low <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> were {{in front of the}} high <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders,</b> the pistons being carried on the same piston rod. Valves for the low <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> were below, and those for the high <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> above the cylinders. One set of valve gear drove each pair of valve spindles. This setup proved difficult to access for maintenance, and the locomotive was relegated to minor routes. It was broken up in 1890. The wheel centres were used in building No. 7 of the Armstrong class.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first stage}} of the {{regulator}} is mounted to the cylinder valve or manifold via one of the standard connectors (Yoke or DIN). It reduces <b>cylinder</b> <b>pressure</b> to an <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressure,</b> usually about [...] higher than the ambient pressure, also called interstage pressure, medium pressure or low pressure. The breathing gas is then supplied to the second stage through a hose.|$|R
50|$|La France was visibly not a GWR engine, {{although}} {{fitted with}} a Swindon chimney and paired with a standard tender, as immediately recognisable from firebox and the cab. Initially the locomotive was painted black, looking more LNWR than GWR, but she was repainted in 1905 into the standard GWR green livery. In contrast to previous GWR practice, La France had two high <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> fitted between the frames, and two low <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> outside. The high <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> drove the front driving wheels while the low <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> drove the rear driving wheels. Also notable was the external steam pipe mounted {{just in front of}} the dome, and looking rather similar in appearance to a top feed.|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{presence}} of <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> under fire conditions significantly {{increases the risk}} rate for the intervening persons. It is considerably problematic to predict the <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> behaviour during heat exposition, its destruction progress and possible following explosion of the produced air–gas mixture because <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> and its environment generate a highly complicated dynamic system during an uncontrolled destruction. The large scale tests {{carried out by the}} Pilsen Fire and Rescue Department and the Rapid Response Unit of the Czech Republic Police in October 2012 and in May 2014 in the Military area Brdy and {{in the area of the}} former Lachema factory in Kaznějov had several objectives, namely, to record, qualify and quantify some of the aspects of an uncontrolled heat destruction procedure of an exposed <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinder</b> in an enclosed space and to qualify and describe the process of a controlled destruction of a <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinder</b> by shooting through it including basic tactical concepts.

50|$|They were three-cylinder {{compound}} locomotives: the two outside high <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{drove the}} trailing drivers via Howe-Stephenson valve gear, the one inside low <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinder</b> drive the leading drivers via a slip eccentric. There was {{no connection between}} the two sets of drivers.|$|R
50|$|Mona's Queen was {{the last}} ship built for the Company to be fitted with {{oscillating}} engines. The diameter of the high <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> was 50 inches, {{the diameter of the}} low <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> was 88 inches, both producing a stroke length of 72 inches.|$|R
50|$|Typically {{compounding}} locomotives use {{a narrow}} {{and a wide}} cylinder, {{to be used for}} high and low pressure. Instead, these HSM locomotives cylinders of different length. The low <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinder</b> was double the length of the high <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The degree of filling of the cylinders could be controlled.|$|R
50|$|The 2-6-6-0 wheel {{arrangement}} was {{most often used}} for articulated compound steam Mallet locomotives. In a compound Mallet, the rear set of coupled wheels are driven by the smaller high <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders,</b> from which spent steam is then fed to the larger low <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> that drive the front set of coupled wheels.|$|R
50|$|Ceramic had two triple {{expansion}} engines, {{each with}} one high pressure, one medium pressure and two low <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Exhaust steam {{from the two}} engines' low <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> drove a single low-pressure steam turbine. Ceramic was propelled by three screws: the middle one driven by the low-pressure turbine and the port and starboard ones each driven {{by one of the}} reciprocating engines.|$|R

50|$|On {{succeeding}} Dean, the GWR board authorised Churchward {{to purchase}} three French de Glehn-du Bousquet four-cylinder compound locomotives, {{in order to}} evaluate the benefits of compounding. Similar to the Paris-Orleans Railway's 3001 class and built by Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques, the first locomotive no.102 La France was delivered in 1903, with Nos. 103 and 104 purchased in 1905. The locomotives had two high <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> fitted between the frames, and two low <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> outside.|$|R
50|$|The {{position}} of the diver's centre of gravity {{is determined by the}} distribution of weight, which is in most cases determined by the actual equipment in use. Trim of the centre of gravity is usually achieved by selection of cylinder material and positioning of main ballast weights and trim weights. Aluminium cylinders are generally less negatively buoyant than steel cylinders of equivalent capacity, and high <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> more negative than low <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> of the same material.|$|R
500|$|Those {{parts of}} the world using the metric system usually refer to the <b>cylinder</b> <b>pressure</b> {{directly}} in bar but would generally use [...] "high pressure" [...] to refer to a [...] working <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinder,</b> which can not be used with a yoke connector on the regulator. 232 bar is a very popular working <b>pressure</b> for scuba <b>cylinders</b> in both steel and aluminium.|$|R
50|$|The center set of {{cylinders}} received high-pressure steam. The exhaust {{from these}} was fed to the two other sets of cylinders, which were valved for low <b>pressure.</b> The right <b>cylinder</b> exhausted into the front set of low <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders,</b> and the left into the rear set; this is also why the high <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> have the same diameter as the low pressure ones, whereas most mallet locomotives have much smaller high <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders.</b> The front set exhausted through the smokebox and the rear set exhausted first through a feedwater heater in the tender {{and then to the}} open air through a large pipe, which {{can be seen in the}} photo. Since only half of the exhaust steam exited through the smokebox, firebox draft (and thus boiler heating) was poor. Although the boiler was large (in line with contemporary two-cylinder and four-cylinder practice), six large cylinders demanded more steam than even such a boiler could supply.|$|R

50|$|The boiler was {{the largest}} of a German steam engine {{at the time the}} XX HV was brought into service and had {{exceptionally}} long heating tubes of 5.8 m in length. The grate was of almost square shape and had to be arranged above the frame due to its size. The boiler was used in the Saxon XVIII H as well, with only minor adjustments to decrease its weight which resulted in a heating area that was smaller by 10 m2. The boiler was supplied with water through two feedwater pumps that were later replaced by one injector and a Knorr feed pump with preheater. The steam engine was configured as a four-cylinder compound. The high <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> sloped steeply between the frame sides, the low <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> were located in the usual, horizontal position outside the frame. Both pairs of cylinders drove the second coupled axle. To control the supply to the low <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> there was a normal Walschaerts valve gear which also controlled the inside cylinders via pendulum levers. A special feature was the Lindner starting cock, already well-known on two-cylinder compounds, which could supply additional live steam to the low <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> when working at over 60%.|$|R
40|$|A {{conceptual}} {{design of a}} 3600 rpm reciprocation expander was developed for maximum thermal input power of 80 kW. The {{conceptual design}} covered two engine configurations; a single cylinder design for simple cycle operation and a two cylinder design for reheat cycle operation. The reheat expander contains a high <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinder</b> and a low <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinder</b> with steam being reheated to the initial inlet temperature after expansion in the high <b>pressure</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Power generation is accomplished with a three-phase induction motor coupled directly to the expander and connected electrically to the public utility power grid. The expander, generator, water pump and control system weigh 297 kg and are dish mounted. The steam condenser, water tank and accessory pumps are ground based. Maximum heat engine efficiency is 33 percent: maximum power conversion efficiency is 30 percent. Total cost is $ 3, 307 or $ 138 per kW of maximum output power...|$|R

25|$|The {{mechanism}} {{inside the}} first stage can be of the diaphragm type or the piston type. Both types can be balanced or unbalanced. Unbalanced regulators have the <b>cylinder</b> <b>pressure</b> pushing {{the first stage}} upstream valve closed, which is opposed by the <b>intermediate</b> stage <b>pressure</b> and a spring. As <b>cylinder</b> <b>pressure</b> falls the closing force is less, so the regulated pressure increases at lower tank pressure. To keep this pressure rise within acceptable limits the high-pressure orifice size is limited, but this decreases the total flow capacity of the regulator. A balanced regulator keeps about the same ease of breathing at all depths and pressures, by using the <b>cylinder</b> <b>pressure</b> to also indirectly oppose {{the opening of the}} first stage valve.|$|R

40|$|The <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressure</b> range {{stands for}} an {{important}} condition for ultrafiltration operations where permeate flux falls below that predicted from a linear flux-pressure relationship {{but does not}} reach the limiting flux. Optimal performance of ultrafiltration might be achieved on {{the upper end of}} the <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressure</b> range because the maximum permeate flux will be obtained at the lowest possible pressure. Unlike in the low pressure range or in the high pressure range, little has been known about the behavior of permeate flux in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressure</b> range. A general theory of permeate flux in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>pressure</b> range is developed in this study. The theory includes the linear-increasing and limiting fluxes as two special cases and, therefore, can be used to study the behavior of permeate flux in ultrafiltration in the whole pressure range.
