5|$|Construction of the B Station began {{shortly after}} the A station was completed. The {{stations}} were built during {{a period in which}} there were great advances in power station technology, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> of production, which led to them having a variety of intermediate generator set sizes along with a mix of design styles. Blyth A had a generating capacity of 480megawatts (MW) and the B Station 1,250MW. Their combined capacity of 1,730MW briefly made Blyth Power Station the largest electricity generation site in England, until Ferrybridge C Power Station came into full operation in 1966. The stations were capable of generating enough electricity to power 300,000homes.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{radio and}} {{particle}} emissions are strongly modulated by its rotation, {{which makes the}} planet somewhat similar to a pulsar. This periodical modulation is probably related to asymmetries in the Jovian magnetosphere, which are caused by the tilt of the magnetic moment {{with respect to the}} rotational axis as well as by high-latitude magnetic anomalies. The physics governing Jupiter's radio emissions {{is similar to that of}} radio pulsars. They differ only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale,</b> and Jupiter can be considered a very small radio pulsar too. In addition, Jupiter's radio emissions strongly depend on solar wind pressure and, hence, on solar activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{demographic}} {{history of}} Scotland includes {{all aspects of}} population history {{in what is now}} Scotland. Scotland may have been first occupied in the last interglacial period (130,000–70,000 BCE), but the earliest surviving archaeological evidence of human settlement is of Mesolithic hunter-gatherer encampments. These suggest a highly mobile boat-using people, probably with a very low density of population. Neolithic farming brought permanent settlements dating from 3500 BCE, and greater concentrations of population. Evidence of hillforts and other buildings suggest a growing settled population. Changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> of woodland indicates that the Roman invasions from the first century CE had a negative impact on the native population.|$|E

5|$|Important for the {{adoption}} of the style {{in the early nineteenth century}} was Abbotsford House, the residence of the novelist and poet, Sir Walter Scott. Re-built for him from 1816, it became a model for the modern revival of the baronial style. Common features borrowed from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century houses included battlemented gateways, crow-stepped gables, pointed turrets and machicolations. The style was popular across Scotland and was applied to relatively modest dwellings by architects such as William Burn (1789–1870), David Bryce (1803–76), Edward Blore (1787–1879), Edward Calvert (c. 1847–1914) and Robert Stodart Lorimer (1864–1929). The publication of Robert Billings' Baronial and Ecclesiastical Architecture of Scotland (1848–52) provided a handbook for the style and the rebuilding of Balmoral Castle as a baronial palace (and subsequent adoption as a royal retreat from 1855–58) confirmed its popularity. Estate house building boomed between about 1855 and the agricultural depression and Glasgow Bank crash of 1878. Construction was now dominated by patronage from nouveau riche industrialists. The decline in numbers of servants, linked to the introduction of electricity, central heating and labour-saving devices such as the vacuum cleaner, also led to changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> of building. Arts and crafts designs first featured in Philip Webb's (1831–1915) gothic design at Arisaig (1863–64). It was pursed by William Lethaby at Melsetter House, Hoy (1898) for a Birmingham industrialist.|$|E
5|$|Similar issues {{occurred}} in New Brunswick where 18,000customers remained without power through July11. More than 310crews remained deployed throughout the province with electricity {{expected to be}} fully restored by the following week. Costs to repair the power grid were estimated in excess of C$12million (US$11.1million). There was criticism that New Brunswick Power did not appropriately prepare for the storm and actually requested assistance from other public power companies and private contractors after the storm had struck. Two public buildings in Fredericton were utilized as recharging centers for residents to charge their phones and shower. An estimated 6,000people took advantage of this through July10. Shaved ice was later distributed from the Grant-Harvey Centre in the city while several waste disposal sites were opened for residents {{to get rid of}} spoiled food from power outages. Gaëtan Thomas, {{president and chief executive officer}} of NB Power, likened the effects of Arthur in the region to Hurricane Katrina along the United States Gulf Coast in August2005. He referenced that during Katrina, 50 percent of the affected region lost power, while in the wake of Arthur 57 percent of New Brunswick was in the dark over a similar geographic area. Earlier cuts to the company's tree-trimming budget were cited as a possible cause <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> of damage. As such, their budget for trimming in 2015 was increased from C$6million to C$8million.|$|E

25|$|The 9th, 11th and 13th chords {{are known}} as {{extended}} tertian chords.

Although changing the octave of certain notes in a chord (within reason) does change the way the chord sounds, it does not change the essential characteristics or tendency of it. Accordingly, using 9th, 11th and 13th in chord notation implies that the chord is an extended tertian chord rather than an added chord (see Added Chords below).|$|E

25|$|Since the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale was {{introduced}} in 1953, comprehensive {{research has been done}} regarding the validity of the scale. across different cultures. In 1967, a study of cross-cultural differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> was done between 9 year-old Japanese, French, and American students. The data concluded that Japanese and French students tested significantly lower on anxiety scores compared to the American students. Thus, there are strong cross-cultural differences related to the scores on the TMAS. Additional studies of the validity of the TMAS include a study between South African Natives and South African Europeans in 1979. Both groups included individuals with varying levels of education.This study found that the TMAS is sensitive to certain cross-cultural differences, but precautions should be taken when interpreting scores from the scale in non-Western cultures, regardless of the individual’s education level.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} years after {{independence}} in 1964, Banda and the governing Malawi Congress Party actively supported the smallholder farming sector, as few European-owned estates remained. Disappointing smallholder production {{and the development of}} a policy of growing Burley tobacco on estates caused the government to transfer land to the estate sector. In 1966, Banda argued that customary land tenure was insecure and inhibited investment. A Customary Land Development Act in 1967 allowed the creation of agricultural leases of up to 99 years over Customary Land. Many estates in the Central Region growing Burley tobacco were controlled by Banda and senior officials and politicians. Land alienation speeded up in the 1970s; however the process differed from that of the early colonial period as most new estates were medium-sized farms and not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> of former European-owned estates. This still represented the transfer of land from smallholders to a better off elite.|$|E
25|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to music develops and refines these skills. Extensive musical training {{does not seem}} to be necessary in the processing of chords and keys. The development of musical competence most likely depends on the encoding of pitch along musical scales and maintaining a regular pulse, both of which are key components in the structure of music and aid in perception, memory, and performance. Also, the encoding of pitch and temporal regularity are both likely to be specialized for music processing. Pitch perception is absolutely crucial to processing music. The use of scales and the organization of scale tones around a central tone (called the tonic) assign particular importance to notes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> and cause non-scale notes to sound out of place. This enables the listener to ascertain when a wrong note is played. However, in individuals with amusia, this ability is either compromised or lost entirely.|$|E

25|$|Spencer's {{interest}} in psychology {{derived from a}} more fundamental concern which was to establish the universality of natural law.

This was in contrast to the views of many theologians of the time who insisted that some parts of creation, in particular the human soul, were beyond the realm of scientific investigation. Comte's Système de Philosophie Positive had been written with the ambition of demonstrating the universality of natural law, and Spencer was to follow Comte <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> of his ambition.

From about 1700 to 1820, no {{nation on the}} Gold Coast of West Africa (region of modern-day Ghana) excelled the Ashanti <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> of their military organization and activity. Wars of conquest made them the major power in the area, and they fought and won several major clashes against the British, before going down to defeat {{in the latter part}} of the 19th century. A small core of professional warriors was supplemented by peasant levies, volunteers and contingents from allied or tributary tribes. Grouped together under competent commanders such as Osei Tutu and Opoku Ware, such hosts began to expand the Ashanti empire in the 18th century on into the 19th, moving from deep inland to the edges of the Atlantic. One British source in 1820 estimated that the Ashanti could field a potential 80,000 troops, and of these, 40,000 could in theory, be outfitted with muskets or blunder-busses.|$|E

Following this and the fighting that followed at Buna–Gona, the American and Australian armies would take steps to improve individual and unit training and medical and logistic infrastructure would also be greatly improved, with an increased focus upon air transport to solve the supply problem. Within the Australian Army, there was a major restructure with the formation of Jungle divisions which addressed manpower issues and were more suited to operations in jungle environments. There was a significant reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> of motor transport, and Jeeps, with greater cross-country mobility, were employed rather than trucks. At battalion level, changes included increasing the number of mortars to eight, the addition of a machine gun platoon with four Vickers guns to enhance organic fire support, and a removal of the carrier platoon. The Land Warfare Centre, as it is now known, was established at Canungra, Queensland, with an emphasis on training for jungle warfare. Adrian Threlfall, in his thesis and subsequent book explores the challenges faced and how these shaped the Australian Army as a jungle warfare force.|$|E
