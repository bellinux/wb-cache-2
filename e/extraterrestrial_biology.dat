40|$|Brief {{review of}} {{relevant}} {{information on the}} composition of stars, interstellar matter, and individual bodies of the solar system. An attempt is made to answer fundamental questions of organic cosmochemistry - namely, {{the nature of the}} organic and related molecules present in our Galaxy and solar system, the distribution of these molecules {{in different parts of the}} two systems, the mechanism of formation of these molecules, and the relation between these molecules and prebiological chemical evolution on the one hand, and terrestrial and, possibly, <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>biology,</b> on the other. Detailed studies are made of the formation and chemical behavior of the organogenic elements in stars, interstellar matter, comets, meteorites, carbonaceous chondrites, and the terrestrial and Jovian planets...|$|E
40|$|We {{explore the}} general astrobiological {{significance}} of F-type main-sequence stars with masses between 1. 2 and 1. 5 Msun. Special consideration {{is given to}} stellar evolutionary aspects due to nuclear main-sequence evolution. DNA is taken {{as a proxy for}} carbon-based macromolecules following the paradigm that <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>biology</b> may be most likely based on hydrocarbons. Consequently, the DNA action spectrum is utilized to represent the impact of the stellar UV radiation. Planetary atmospheric attenuation is taken into account based on parameterized attenuation functions. We found that the damage inflicted on DNA for planets at Earth-equivalent positions is between a factor of 2. 5 and 7. 1 higher than for solar-like stars, and there are intricate relations for the time-dependence of damage during stellar main-sequence evolution. If attenuation is considered, smaller factors of damage are obtained in alignment to the attenuation parameters. This work is motivated by earlier studies indicating that the UV environment of solar-type stars {{is one of the most}} decisive factors in determining the suitability of exosolar planets and exomoons for biological evolution and sustainability.

40|$|We {{explore the}} astrobiological {{significance}} of F-type stars of spectral type between F 5 V and F 9. 5 V, which possess Jupiter-type planets within {{or close to}} their climatological habitable zones. These planets, {{or at least a}} subset of those, may also possess rocky exomoons, which potentially offer habitable environments. Our work considers eight selected systems. The Jupiter-type planets in these systems are in notably differing orbits with eccentricities between 0. 08 (about Mars) and 0. 72. We consider the stellar UV environments provided by the photospheric stellar radiation, which allows us to compute the UV habitable zones for the systems. Following previous studies, DNA is taken as a proxy for carbon-based macromolecules following the paradigm that <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>biology</b> might be based on hydrocarbons. We found that the damage inflicted on DNA is notably different for the range of systems studied, and also varies according to the orbit of the Jupiter-type planet, especially for systems of high ellipticity, as expected. For some systems excessive values of damage are attained compared to today's Earth or during the Archean eon. Considering that the detection of exomoons around different types of stars will remain challenging in the foreseeable future, we view our work also as an example and template for investigating the combined requirements of climatological and UV-based habitability for exosolar objects.

5|$|The {{implications}} of discovery depend {{very much on}} the level of aggressiveness of the civilization interacting with humanity, its ethics, and how much human and <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>biologies</b> have in common. These factors will govern the quantity and type of dialogue that can take place. The question of whether contact is physical or through electromagnetic signals will also govern the magnitude of the long-term {{implications of}} contact. In the case of communication using electromagnetic signals, the long silence between the reception of one message and another would mean that the content of any message would particularly affect the consequences of contact, as would the extent of mutual comprehension.|$|R

50|$|Consequently, {{anyone who}} ever succeeds {{in their quest}} to obtain the Winslow faces the {{combined}} zeal {{of tens of thousands of}} other cultures and species hell-bent on the same goal. Probably the most effective way to obtain the indestructible Winslow for one's own is to vaporize the current host's home planet and collect it from amongst the remaining debris (as suggested by a tabloid reporter and rejected by her editor). Because of the obvious need to keep the whereabouts of the Winslow hidden, humanity, generally indifferent to the Winslow and its supposed divinity, accepted its secret custodianship from the Prime Mover, a member of a race of omnipotent superbeings whose primary function appears to be keeping all manners of conflicting <b>extraterrestrial</b> cultures, <b>biologies,</b> and religions from annihilating one another. The Prime Movers, however, only exacerbate religious turmoil by continuing to maintain that the Winslow is the single most important being in the history of the universe, yet pointedly refusing to elaborate as to why (though they all say it's not any of the reasons the various other races have come up with so far). This is the sort of enigmatic, condescending and totally useless statement that makes a large majority of the scientists and philosophers of The Gallimaufry yearn to pound The Prime Movers' ever-so-superior heads in with a large cosmic tire iron.|$|R
40|$|Researchers in the Astrobiology Technology Branch at Ames Research Center {{have begun}} {{investigating}} alternate concepts {{for the detection}} of extraterrestrial life. We suggest searching for extraterrestrial ecology, exoecology, as well as for <b>extraterrestrial</b> <b>biology,</b> exobiology. Ecology describes the interactions of living things with their environment. All ecosystems are highly constrained by their environment and are constrained by well-known system design principles. Ecology could exist wherever there is an energy source and living I things have discovered some means to capture, store, and use the available energy. Terrestrial ecosystems use as energy sources, light, organic molecules, and in thermal vents and elsewhere, simple inorganic molecules. Ecosystem behavior is controlled by matter and energy conservation laws and can be described by linear and nonlinear dynamic systems theory. Typically in an ecosystem different molecules are not in chemical equilibrium and scarce material is conserved, stored, or recycled. Temporal cycles and spatial variations are often observed. These and other -eneral principles of exoecology can help guide the search for extraterrestrial life. The chemical structure observed in terrestrial biology may be highly contingent on evolutionary accidents. Oxygen was not always abundant on Earth. Primitive sulfur bacteria use hydrogen sulfide and sulfur to perform photosynthesis instead of water and oxygen. Astrobiologists have assumed, for the sake of narrowing and focusing our life detection strategies, that extraterrestrial life will have detailed chemical similarities with terrestrial life. Such assumptions appear very reasonable and they allow us to design specific and highly sensitive life detection experiments. But the fewer assumptions we make, the less chance we have of being entirely wrong The best strategy {{for the detection of}} extraterrestrial life could be a mixed strategy. We should use detailed assumptions based on terrestrial biology to guide some but not all future searches for alien life. The systems principles of exoecology seem much more fundamental and inescapable than the terrestrial biology analogies of exobiology. We should search for exoecology as well as exobiology...|$|E
