25|$|U.S. Senator Tom Harkin (Iowa) ran as {{a populist}} liberal with labor union support. Former U.S. Senator Paul Tsongas (Massachusetts) {{highlighted}} his political independence and fiscal conservatism. Former California Governor Jerry Brown, {{who had run}} for the Democratic nomination in 1976 and 1980 {{while he was still}} Governor, declared a significant reform agenda, including Congressional term limits, campaign finance reform, and the adoption of a flat income tax. Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey was an attractive candidate based on his business and military background, but made several gaffes on the campaign trail. Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton positioned himself as a centrist, or New Democrat. He was still relatively unknown nationally before the primary season. That quickly changed however, when a woman named <b>Gennifer</b> <b>Flowers</b> appeared in the press to reveal allegations of an affair. Clinton rebutted the story by appearing on 60 Minutes with his wife, Hillary Clinton.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} primary contest, the Iowa Caucus, Clinton {{finished}} a distant third to Iowa Senator Tom Harkin. During {{the campaign for}} the New Hampshire primary, reports surfaced that Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with <b>Gennifer</b> <b>Flowers.</b> Clinton fell far behind former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the New Hampshire polls. Following Super Bowl XXVI, Clinton and his wife Hillary went on 60 Minutes to rebuff the charges. Their television appearance was a calculated risk, but Clinton regained several delegates. He finished second to Tsongas in the New Hampshire primary, but after trailing badly {{in the polls and}} coming within single digits of winning, the media viewed it as a victory. News outlets labeled him [...] "The Comeback Kid" [...] for earning a firm second-place finish.|$|E
500|$|Clinton {{received}} sustained {{national attention}} {{for the first}} time when her husband became a candidate for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Before the New Hampshire primary, tabloid publications printed assertions that Bill Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with <b>Gennifer</b> <b>Flowers.</b> In response, the Clintons appeared together on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied the affair, but acknowledged [...] "causing pain in my marriage". This joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign. During the campaign, Hillary made culturally disparaging remarks about Tammy Wynette's outlook on marriage as described in her classic song [...] "Stand by Your Man", and later in the campaign about how she could have chosen to be like women staying home and baking cookies and having teas, but wanted to pursue her career instead. The remarks were widely criticized, particularly by those who were, or defended, stay-at-home mothers and in retrospect, were ill-considered by her own admission. Bill said that in electing him, the nation would [...] "get two for the price of one", referring to the prominent role his wife would assume. Beginning with Daniel Wattenberg's August 1992 The American Spectator article [...] "The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock", Hillary's own past ideological and ethical record came under attack from conservatives. At least twenty other articles in major publications also drew comparisons between her and Lady Macbeth.|$|E
