500|$|Describing {{himself as}} a child, Cooper has said: [...] "I never lived the life of 'Oh, you're so good-looking'. People thought I was a girl when I was little, because I looked like a girl—maybe because my mother would keep my hair really long". He excelled at basketball, and enjoyed cooking: [...] "I used to have buddies come over after {{kindergarten}} and I'd cook them food. <b>I</b> <b>prided</b> <b>myself</b> in taking whatever was in the fridge and turning it into lasagna." [...] He initially wanted to attend a military academy and move to Japan to become a ninja. At an early age, his father introduced him to films like The Elephant Man, which inspired him to be an actor. Cooper says that his parents were initially apprehensive of his career choice, but they eventually changed their perceptions when they saw Cooper play the part of Joseph Merrick in {{an excerpt from the}} play The Elephant Man.|$|E

60|$|But he {{presented}} an exceedingly difficult shot. Backing down the ridge, I ran {{a little way}} to come up behind another tree, from which I soon shifted to a fallen pine. Over this I peeped, to get a splendid view of the wolf. He had stopped tugging at the horse, and stood with his nose in the air. Surely {{he could not have}} scented me, for the wind was strong from him to me; neither could he have heard my soft footfalls on the pine needles; nevertheless, he was suspicious. Loth to spoil the picture he made, I risked a chance, and waited. Besides, though <b>I</b> <b>prided</b> <b>myself</b> on being able to take a fair aim, I had no great hope that I could hit him at such a distance. Presently he returned to his feeding, but not for long. Soon he raised his long, fine-pointed head, and trotted away a few yards, stopped to sniff again, then went back to his gruesome work.|$|E

60|$|It has dawned upon me that I {{have never}} placed a proper {{valuation}} upon womankind. For that matter, though not amative to any considerable degree {{so far as}} I have discovered, I was never outside the atmosphere of women until now. My mother and sisters were always about me, and I {{was always trying to}} escape them; for they worried me to distraction with their solicitude for my health and with their periodic inroads on my den, when my orderly confusion, upon which <b>I</b> <b>prided</b> <b>myself,</b> was turned into worse confusion and less order, though it looked neat enough to the eye. I never could find anything when they had departed. But now, alas, how welcome would have been the feel of their presence, the frou-frou and swish-swish of their skirts which I had so cordially detested! I am sure, if I ever get home, that I shall never be irritable with them again. They may dose me and doctor me morning, noon, and night, and dust and sweep and put my den to rights every minute of the day, and I shall only lean back and survey it all and be thankful in that I am possessed of a mother and some several sisters.|$|E

"When I {{began this}} small treatise, {{it was for}} my sole satisfaction, {{so as not to}} lose memory of the {{knowledge}} that I had acquired by means of long toil, and by divers experiments repeated several times. I cannot conceal that seeing it achieved beyond what I had dared to expect, I was tempted to publish it; but if I had reason to bring it to light, I had even more reason to keep it hidden and not to expose it to general censure[...] [...] [...] I dwelt irresolute in this combat almost two years. I objected to myself that teaching was not the profession of a woman; that she ought to remain in silence, to listen and to learn, without bearing witness that she knows: that it is above her to give a work to the public, and that such a reputation is not by any means advantageous[...] [...] <b>I</b> <b>prided</b> <b>myself</b> that I am not the first woman to have placed something under the press, that mind has no sex, and if the minds of women were cultivated like those of men, and if we employed as much time and money in their instruction they could become their equal." ...|$|E
5000|$|Cooper {{was born}} on January 5, 1975, in Philadelphia, {{and grew up in}} the nearby {{communities}} of Jenkintown and Rydal. His mother, Gloria (née Campano), worked for the local NBC affiliate. His father, Charles Cooper, who died in January 2011, worked as a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch. Charles Cooper was of Irish descent, while Gloria Cooper is of Italian ancestry (from Abruzzo and Naples). Cooper has an older sister, Holly. He was raised as a Roman Catholic. He had cholesteatoma in his ear soon after his birth, and punctured his eardrum when he started diving at an early age.Describing himself as a child, Cooper has said: [...] "I never lived the life of 'Oh, you're so good-looking'.

40|$|<b>I</b> <b>prided</b> <b>myself</b> {{as being}} one who embraced change. I often became disgusted with my fellow {{teachers}} when they dragged {{their feet and}} resisted district initiatives. I also believed in setting goals and then managing the tasks that allows one to reach the goals. I thought it was {{merely a matter of}} purposeful planning, effort, and time that allowed one to meet goals.

40|$|Before Bobby vanished, {{him and me}} sold {{plastics}} to the Shade Point PD {{in exchange}} for candy corn, chocolate bars, and chewing gum. Our go-to guy, Lieutenant Hurns, was a two-ton boa constrictor with jack o’ lantern eyes, but he always took our goods. I’d known The Boa since my days on the force, back before I got canned. Back before I became a private eye and took up the junk trade. We scavenged, mostly—Bobby and me. Dumpsters, vacant houses, and the occasional big lift from department stores kept us in steady supply. Usually we got The Boa strong fibered stuff like Honey Walkers, Catalina Black Cats, and Potato Heads. <b>I</b> <b>prided</b> <b>myself</b> on doing good business. Treat a customer right and he’ll come back—that’s what Sarge always said [...] ...|$|E
40|$|As a Computing/ICT Head of Department {{in a large}} {{secondary}} {{comprehensive school}} in Birmingham England, crystal ball gazing was an exercise in which I had to be skilled. One {{of the things that}} <b>I</b> <b>prided</b> <b>myself</b> upon was my ability to predict new developments before they happened, and better still, begin implementing subtle changes so that when the crunch truly came, we were ready. So, when the then Secretary of State Michael Gove made a speech at the BETT Show in 2012 and said those words that would define and shape our future; that the Department for Education were to consult upon “withdrawing the existing National Curriculum Programme of Study for ICT from September” ([URL] it wasn’t a shock to me.

5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>pride</b> <b>myself</b> {{in making}} my concerts user-friendly, ... I {{want to make}} the concert seem like I'm playing in their living room.

60|$|MRS. H. You pride {{yourself}} on plain speech, Jill. <b>I</b> <b>pride</b> <b>myself</b> on plain thought. You will thank me afterwards that I can see realities. I {{know we are}} better people than these Hornblowers. Here {{we are going to}} stay, and they--are not.|$|R
60|$|He {{paused a}} moment in order to reflect; his steel-grey eyes, cool and disdainful, were fixed searchingly on my face. <b>I</b> <b>pride</b> <b>myself</b> on the way that I bear that kind of scrutiny, so even now I looked bland and withal {{purposeful}} and capable.|$|R
60|$|And {{worse than}} all, my best pair of pantaloons, and the pair <b>I</b> most <b>prided</b> <b>myself</b> upon, {{was a very}} {{conspicuous}} and remarkable looking pair.|$|R
6000|$|... 'There's {{a splendid}} turn-over!' I thought to myself. 'If this luck holds, {{at the same}} rate, I shall have made four hundred and eighty pounds by Tuesday next, and I may look forward to being a Barney Barnato by Christmas.'

6000|$|... 'Ah! I see {{you are a}} droll. Very good indeed. Well, for my part, I like a watering-place existence. Cnidos, Paphos, Cythera; {{you will}} usually find me {{at one of these}} places. I like the easy {{distraction}} of a career without any visible result. At these fascinating spots your gloomy race, to whom, by-the-bye, I am exceedingly partial, appear emancipated from the wearing fetters of their regular, dull, orderly, methodical, moral, political, toiling existence. <b>I</b> <b>pride</b> <b>myself</b> upon being the Goddess of watering-places.

If there's one thing more than another <b>I</b> <b>pride</b> <b>myself</b> on, it's my indulgence for human frailty. But, in my position here, I'm obliged to be careful. Upon my soul, I can't continue my acquaintance with a man who--oh, come! come! don't look as if you didn't understand me. The circumstances are against you, sir. You have treated me infamously." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Death from {{accident}} while {{engaged in}} illegal fishing." [...] That was {{the verdict of}} the coroner's jury; {{and that is why}} <b>I</b> <b>pride</b> <b>myself</b> on the neat and artistic way in which I finished off John Claverhouse. There was no bungling, no brutality; nothing of which to be ashamed in the whole transaction, as I am sure you will agree. No more does his infernal laugh go echoing among the hills, and no more does his fat moon-face rise up to vex me. My days are peaceful now, and my night's sleep deep.|$|R
5|$|It's good to {{know people}} didn't see it coming. That's a big concern when you {{have this kind of}} story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal. You don't want people to be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. <b>I</b> <b>pride</b> <b>myself</b> in the fact that, when you pick up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|R

6000|$|Dalmahoy pointed. The aëronaut lay at my feet, {{collapsed}} {{like some}} monstrous marionette, with {{legs and arms}} a-splay. Across his legs, with head propped against a locker, reclined Sheepshanks, and gazed upwards with an approving smile. [...] "Awkward business," [...] explained Dalmahoy, between gasps. [...] "Sheepshanks 'nmanageable; can't carry his liquor like a gentleman: thought it funny 'pitch out ballast. Byfield lost his temper: worst thing in the world. One thing <b>I</b> <b>pride</b> <b>myself,</b> 'menable to reason. No holding Sheepshanks: Byfield got him down; too late; faint both of us.

I'm afraid you will think me a bore for {{sticking}} to the point like this, but the fact is, the one thing <b>I</b> <b>pride</b> <b>myself</b> on is my memory for faces. It's a hobby of mine. If I think I remember a face, and can't place it, I worry myself into insomnia. It's partly sheer vanity, and partly because in my job a good memory for faces is a mighty fine asset. It has helped me a hundred times.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{remember}} {{such a case}} in the Thames Police Court. <b>I</b> <b>pride</b> <b>myself</b> that <b>I</b> {{have good}} eyes and ears, and a fair working knowledge of men and things; but I confess, as I stood in that court-room, that I was half bewildered by the amazing despatch with which drunks, disorderlies, vagrants, brawlers, wife-beaters, thieves, fences, gamblers, {{and women of the}} street went through the machine of justice. The dock stood in the centre of the court (where the light is best), and into it and out again stepped men, women, and children, in a stream as steady as the stream of sentences which fell from the magistrate's lips.|$|R
60|$|Now, <b>I</b> <b>pride</b> <b>myself</b> {{on doing}} things neatly, and when I {{resolved}} to kill John Claverhouse I {{had it in}} mind {{to do so in}} such fashion that I should not look back upon it and feel ashamed. I hate bungling, and I hate brutality. To me there is something repugnant in merely striking a man with one's naked fist--faugh! it is sickening! So, to shoot, or stab, or club John Claverhouse (oh, that name!) did not appeal to me. And not only was I impelled to do it neatly and artistically, but also in such manner that not the slightest possible suspicion could be directed against me.|$|R
5000|$|At his trial, just as {{it looked}} as if the {{military}} judges were getting the upper hand he turned the atmosphere of the court: [...] "In the glorious name of the people. I will defend myself in a court which I neither recognise its legality nor its legitimacy. As a Marxist my address is to the people and history. The more you attack me the more <b>I</b> <b>pride</b> <b>myself,</b> the further <b>I</b> am from you the closer I am to the people. The more your hatred for my beliefs, the stronger the kindness and support of the people. Even if you bury me—and you certainly will—people will make flags and songs from my corpse".|$|R
