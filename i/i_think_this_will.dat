Charlie Beckett, a media communications expert at the London School of Economics (LSE), said Invisible Children ,"haven't got the capacity for is to take that beyond another action.

Waters told the Associated Press that The Wall Tour will likely be his last, stating: [...] "I'm not as young as I used to be. I'm not like B.B. King, or Muddy Waters. I'm not a great vocalist or a great instrumentalist or whatever, but I still have the fire in my belly, and I have something to say. I have a swan song in me and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> probably be it." [...] At The O2 Arena in London on 12 May 2011, Gilmour and Mason once again appeared with Waters and Gilmour performing [...] "Comfortably Numb", and Gilmour and Mason joining Waters for [...] "Outside the Wall". For the first half of 2012, Waters' tour topped worldwide concert ticket sales having sold more than 1.4 million tickets globally. As of 2013, The Wall Live is the highest-grossing tour of all time by a solo artist. Waters performed at [...] at Madison Square Garden on 12 December 2012. On 24 July 2015, Waters headlined the Newport Folk Festival in Newport, Rhode Island. Waters was accompanied by the band My Morning Jacket and two singers from the group Lucius.|$|E

2500|$|Although bell hooks doesn't name {{individual}} separatist theorists, Mary Daly's utopian {{vision of}} {{a world in which}} men and heterosexual women have been eliminated is an extreme example of this tendency. Daly argued that sexual equality between men and women was not possible and that women, due to their superior capacities, should rule men. Yet later, in an interview, Daly argued [...] "If life is to survive on this planet, there must be a decontamination of the Earth. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> be accompanied by an evolutionary process that will result in a drastic reduction of the population of males." ...|$|E
2500|$|Macquarie Group economists {{estimated}} {{the energy crisis}} could reduce gross domestic product growth by 0.25 percentage points in the third quarter, as gas prices increased {{and the percentage of}} gas production allocated to export reduced. Natural gas sales were worth $5.2billion in the 2006/2007 financial year, and its five-year trend growth rate is 16.8%. Chief Macquarie economist Richard Gibbs said, [...] "WA supplies the lion's share of the gas exports. The effect on exports is that as {{there is a shortage of}} gas in the system, the capability to export will be diminished because the gas that there is will be directed towards domestic use... The gas exports have been pretty healthy. In the next couple of quarters that will be moderated dramatically if not stalled altogether. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> have an impact on the broader commodities side and the trade gap could widen".|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of July, Maroney competed at the Olympic Trials in San Jose, California. [...] After {{the first day of}} competition she said, [...] "I'm thankful that I'm even here. I knew I had to hit vault because it's the most important event for me to make the Olympic team." [...] Though she had falls on both bars and beam on day one, and a major loss of formation on bars during day two, she placed seventh in the all-around with a two-day combined score of 117.650. In event finals, she placed first on vault scoring 31.700 and fifth on floor scoring 29.700. Afterwards, Maroney was chosen {{as a member of the}} team that was sent to the 2012 Summer Olympics. [...] She said, [...] "This is the best feeling – it's just so amazing. I'm in shock right now. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> be the happiest I'll ever be in my life. [...] It's the absolute best feeling knowing that I trained so hard for this and all the hard things that I have accomplished and now to be on this team. [...] These girls are my best friends. [...] My team mate Kyla Ross, we have been best friends since we were six years old so it's just absolutely amazing to be going to the Olympics." [...] When asked about feeling pressure to win gold on vault at the Olympics, she replied, [...] "If I do my job I know I can get the gold medal. [...] That's what they picked me to be on the team for, so I need to be confident about that." ...|$|E

6000|$|Wednesday was fine, {{and soon}} after breakfast the barouche arrived, Mr. Crawford driving his sisters; and as {{everybody}} was ready, {{there was nothing to}} be done but for Mrs. Grant to alight and the others to take their places. The place of all places, the envied seat, the post of honour, was unappropriated. To whose happy lot was it to fall?

6000|$|This hint {{produced}} dinner. Mrs. Flockhart, {{smiling in}} her weeds {{like the sun}} through a mist, took {{the head of the}} table, thinking within herself, perhaps, that she cared not how long the rebellion lasted that brought her into company so much above her usual associates. She was supported by Waverley and the Baron, with the advantage of the Chieftain vis-a-vis. The men of peace and of war, that is, Bailie Macwheeble and Ensign Maccombich, after many profound conges to their superiors and each other, took their places {{on each side of the}} Chieftain. Their fare was excellent, time, place, and circumstances considered, and Fergus's spirits were extravagantly high. Regardless of danger, and sanguine from temper, youth, and ambition, he saw in imagination all his prospects crowned with success, and was totally indifferent to the probable alternative of a soldier's grave. The Baron apologized slightly for bringing Macwheeble. They had been providing, he said, for the expenses of the campaign. 'And, by my faith,' said the old man, 'as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> be my last, so I just end where I began: I hae evermore found the sinews of war, as a learned author calls the caisse militaire, mair difficult to come by than either its flesh, blood, or bones.' ...|$|E
