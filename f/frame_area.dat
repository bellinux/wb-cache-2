Camera negative film had larger grain than the film stocks used for prints, so there was a consistent approach in using a larger frame on the film negative than on prints. Since prints need to allow space for soundtracks while camera negative does not, CinemaScope 55 had different frame dimensions for camera negative and print film.|$|E

50|$|Because Maxivision {{uses only}} three film {{perforations}} per frame, the twenty-four-frame-per-second format uses 25% less film than standard four-perforation formats, and the 48 frame-per-second format only requires a 50% {{increase in the}} amount of film to yield twice the frame rate. The image is exposed into the region ordinarily reserved for the analog optical sound track which is rarely used now. This allows for a wider image on the same size film. This also reduces the need for cropping of the image and makes for a 30% larger total <b>frame</b> <b>area</b> than traditional projection even though less film is used.|$|E
50|$|Most modern {{digital camera}} backs use CCD or CMOS matrix sensors.

The Census Bureau is currently conducting evaluations to support the goal of using a MAF-based frame to replace the current multiple frames for the 2010 Demographic Survey Redesign. The current frames include a unit frame, a group quarters (GQ) frame, a permit <b>frame,</b> and an <b>area</b> <b>frame.</b> The unit frame and the GQ frame cover addresses of housing units and group quarters that existed {{during the time of}} Census 2000 in blocks that had a high percent complete addresses, i. e., addresses that had a house number, a street name, and a zip code, and had building permit coverage.

50|$|The Technirama process used a film <b>frame</b> <b>area</b> {{twice as}} large as CinemaScope, which created a sharper image with less {{photographic}} grain. Cameras used 35-mm film running horizontally with an 8-perforation frame, double the normal size, exactly the same as VistaVision. VistaVision cameras were sometimes adapted. Technirama used a 1.5:1 anamorphic optic in front of the lens in order to stretch the vertical image (unlike CinemaScope camera lenses which squeezed the image horizontally). To achieve the required wider format, lenses of shorter focal-length had to be used. In the laboratory, the 8-perforation horizontal negative would be reduced optically, incorporating a 1.33:1 horizontal squeeze to create normal 4-perforation (vertically running) prints with images having an anamorphic ratio of 2:1.|$|E
5000|$|This [...] "flat" [...] {{widescreen}} {{process was}} adopted by other studios {{and by the end}} of 1953, more than half of the theatres in America had installed wide screens. However, there were drawbacks: because a smaller portion of the image was being used and magnification was increased, excessive grain and soft images plagued early widescreen presentations. Some studios sought to compensate for this by shooting their color pictures with a full aperture gate (rather than the Academy aperture), and then reducing the image in Technicolor's optical printer. This process is a predecessor of today's Super 35 format which also uses a 1.85:1 ratio, but uses one-third more <b>frame</b> <b>area</b> than a standard 1.85:1 matted into a 4:3.|$|E
5000|$|An in-camera {{multiple}} exposure {{is made by}} recording on {{only one part of}} each film frame, rewinding the film to exactly the same start point, exposing a second part, and repeating the process as needed. The resulting negative is a composite of all the individual exposures. (By contrast, a [...] "double exposure" [...] records multiple images on the entire <b>frame</b> <b>area,</b> so that all are partially visible through one another.) Exposing one section at a time is made possible by enclosing the camera lens (or the whole camera) in a light-tight box fitted with maskable openings, each one corresponding to one of the action areas. Only one opening is revealed per exposure, to record just the action positioned in front of it.|$|E

40|$|LUCAS (Land Use/Cover <b>Area</b> <b>frame</b> Survey) {{has been}} {{launched}} by the European Union (EU) in 2001 based on an <b>area</b> <b>frame</b> of points with a two-stage systematic sampling. We discuss some possible options to improve LUCAS assuming that it could combine in the future an annual survey focused on arable land with a general purpose survey. A test is being carried in Greece out with a two-phase <b>area</b> <b>frame</b> of unclustered points, following the current approach of the Italian AGRIT survey. The high share of the variance coming from the first sasmpling stage suggests that unclustered points can be better. The same conclusion is reached considering the “equivalent number of points of a Primary Sampling Unit”. A simulation shows that a stratification based on photo-interpretation is much more efficient with unclustered points (single stage sampling) than with the current two-stage design if the photo-interpretation is very accurate. The gain is debatable with a moderate amount of photo-interpretation errors.

5000|$|The {{development}} of anamorphic widescreen arose {{due to a}} desire for wider aspect ratios while maintaining the use of standard (4 perf/frame) cameras and projectors, and maximising overall image detail. The modern anamorphic format has an aspect ratio of 2.40:1, meaning the (projected) picture width is 2.40 times its height, (technically it is 2.39:1, but it is known professionally as 2.40:1 or [...] "two-four-oh"). Academy format 35 mm film (standard non-anamorphic full frame with sound tracks in the image area) has an aspect ratio of 1.37:1, which is not as wide (or, equivalently, is taller). In non-anamorphic spherical ("flat") widescreen imaging, the picture is recorded on film so that its full width fits within the film frame, but substantial film <b>frame</b> <b>area</b> is wasted on portions that will be matted out {{by the time of}} projection, either on the print or in the projector, {{in order to create a}} widescreen image in the theater (Figure 1).|$|E
5000|$|Triacetate {{remains in}} use for most camera {{negative}} stocks {{because it can}} be [...] "invisibly" [...] spliced using solvents during negative assembly, while polyester film can only be spliced using adhesive tape patches or ultrasonically, both of which leave visible marks in the <b>frame</b> <b>area.</b> Also, polyester film is so strong, it will not break under tension and may cause serious damage to expensive camera or projector mechanisms {{in the event of a}} film jam, whereas triacetate film breaks easily, reducing the risk of damage. Many were opposed to the use of polyester for release prints for precisely this reason, and because ultrasonic splicers are very expensive items, beyond the budgets of many smaller theaters. In practice, though, this has not proved to be as much of a problem as was feared. Rather, with the increased use of automated long-play systems in cinemas, the greater strength of polyester has been a significant advantage in lessening the risk of a film performance being interrupted by a film break.|$|E
50|$|At the theater, release {{prints are}} {{projected}} through an aperture plate, placed between {{the film and}} the projector's light source. The aperture plate in combination with a prime lens of the appropriate focal distance determines which areas of the frame are magnified and projected and which are masked out, according to the aspect ratio in which the film {{is intended to be}} projected. Sometimes a hard matte is used in printing to ensure that only the area of the frame shot in the camera that is intended to be projected is actually present on the release print. Some theaters have also used aperture plates that mask away part of the <b>frame</b> <b>area</b> that is supposed to be projected, usually where the screen is too small to accommodate a wider ratio and does not have a masking system in front of the screen itself. The audience may be confused when significant action appears on the masked-off edges of the picture.

50|$|The Lunar Orbiters had {{an ingenious}} imaging system, which {{consisted}} of a dual-lens camera, a film processing unit, a readout scanner, and a film handling apparatus. Both lenses, a 610 mm narrow angle high resolution (HR) lens and an 80 mm wide angle medium resolution (MR) lens, placed their frame exposures on a single roll of 70 mm film. The axes of the two cameras were coincident so the area imaged in the HR frames were centered within the MR <b>frame</b> <b>areas.</b> The film was moved during exposure {{to compensate for the}} spacecraft velocity, which was estimated by an electro-optical sensor.

5000|$|The {{negative}} film had the perforations (of the CS [...] "Fox-hole" [...] type) {{close to the}} edge of the film and the camera aperture was 1.824" [...] by 1.430" [...] (approx. 46 mm x 36 mm), giving an image area of 2.61 sq. inch. This compares to the 0.866" [...] by 0.732" [...] (approx. 22 mm x 18.6 mm) frame of a modern anamorphic 35 mm negative, which provides a <b>frame</b> <b>area</b> of 0.64 sq. inch. On the print film, however, there was a smaller frame size of approximately 1.34" [...] x 1.06" [...] (34 mm x 27 mm) to allow space for the 6 magnetic soundtracks. Four of these soundtracks (two each side) were outside the perforations, which were further from the edges of the print film than in the {{negative film}}; the other two soundtracks were between the perforations and the image. The pull-down for the negative was 8 perforations, while for the smaller frame on the print film, it was 6 perforations. In both cases, however, the frame had an aspect ratio of 1.275:1, which when expanded by a 2:1 anamorphic lens resulted in an image of 2.55:1.|$|E
5000|$|The initial SMPTE {{definition}} for anamorphic projection with an {{optical sound track}} down the side (PH22.106-1957), issued in December 1957, standardized the projector aperture at 0.839 xx 0.715 in (aspect ratio 1.17:1). The aspect ratio for this aperture, after a 2x unsqueeze, is 2.3468…:1 which rounded to the commonly used value 2.35:1. A new definition was issued in October 1970 (PH22.106-1971) which specified a slightly smaller vertical dimension of 0.700 in. for the projector aperture to help make splices less noticeable to film viewers. Four-perf anamorphic prints use more of the negative's available <b>frame</b> <b>area</b> than any other modern format which leaves little room for splices; as a consequence, a bright line would flash onscreen when a splice was projected and theater projectionists had been narrowing the vertical aperture to hide these flashes even before issuance of PH22.106-1971. This new projector aperture size, 0.838 xx 0.700 in, aspect ratio 1.1971…:1, made for an un-squeezed ratio of 2.39:1 (and commonly referred to by the rounded value 2.40:1 or 2.4:1). The most recent revision, from August 1993 (SMPTE 195-1993), slightly altered the dimensions so as to standardize a common projection aperture width (0.825 in) for all formats, anamorphic (2.39:1) and flat (1.85:1). The projection aperture height was also reduced by 0.01" [...] in this modern specification to 0.825 xx 0.690 in, aspect ratio 1.1956…:1 (and commonly rounded to 1.20:1), to retain the un-squeezed ratio of 2.39:1. The camera's aperture remained the same (2.35:1 or 2.55:1 if before 1958), only {{the height of the}} [...] "negative assembly" [...] splices changed and, consequently, the height of the frame changed.|$|E
50|$|While {{there are}} simple methods to produce {{somewhat}} satisfactory progressive frames from the interlaced image, for example by doubling {{the lines of}} one field and omitting the other (halving vertical resolution), or anti-aliasing the image in the vertical axis to hide some of the combing, there are sometimes methods of producing results far superior to these. If there is only sideways (X axis) motion between the two fields and this motion is even throughout the full frame, {{it is possible to}} align the scanlines and crop the left and right ends that exceed the <b>frame</b> <b>area</b> to produce a visually satisfactory image. Minor Y axis motion can be corrected similarly by aligning the scanlines in a different sequence and cropping the excess at the top and bottom. Often the middle of the picture is the most necessary area to put into check, and whether there is only X or Y axis alignment correction, or both are applied, most artifacts will occur towards the edges of the picture. However, even these simple procedures require motion tracking between the fields, and a rotating or tilting object, or one that moves in the Z axis (away from or towards the camera) will still produce combing, possibly even looking worse than if the fields were joined in a simpler method. Some deinterlacing processes can analyze each frame individually and decide the best method. The best and only perfect conversion in these cases is to treat each frame as a separate image, but that may not always be possible. For framerate conversions and zooming it would mostly be ideal to line-double each field to produce a double rate of progressive frames, resample the frames to the desired resolution and then re-scan the stream at the desired rate, either in progressive or interlaced mode.|$|E
