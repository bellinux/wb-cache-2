40|$|Abstract. An {{intelligent}} greenhouse {{remote control}} system based on VC++ 6. 0 has been designed according {{to the needs of}} greenhouse control. The structure of this system is composed of four layers: a remote computer is taken as the client-side, a local computer is taken as the server-side, a singlechip of Stc 15 f 2 k 60 s 2 is adopted as the greenhouse controller, a data collection unit and actuators. The <b>environment</b> <b>parameters</b> and actuators running state can be realtime displayed in the remote control software and the opening and closing of actuators in the greenhouse can be manual controlled by remote computer. The local computer monitoring software has the functions of real-time display, data storage, parameter settings and changings, the design of fuzzy control strategy and the status display of actuators, so as to control the <b>environment</b> <b>parameters</b> such as temperature and humidity by setting different temperature value in different period.

This paper presents an architecture for <b>environment</b> <b>parameter</b> estimation during bilateral telemanipulation.

The slave-environment contact force tracks the sum of the force applied by the human to the master and a persistent excitation force required for accurate <b>environment</b> <b>parameter</b> estimation. Since force feedback to the human operator should only reflect the environment properties, several methods for force feedback are considered.

30|$|The {{proposed}} framework allows {{developers to}} generate an executable {{model for the}} management of smart environment devices. To enable the executable model generation, developers provide a model of the considered environment and the target objective. The environment model is defined by specifying for each device, its states, its state transitions and its effects on the <b>environment</b> <b>parameters.</b> The objectives are defined by specifying the values the <b>environment</b> <b>parameters</b> must take. From the environment model and the objectives are generated a controller and an execution rule. At runtime, the execution rule collects data from the environment and invokes the controller that makes appropriate decisions to reliably achieve the objectives. In the followings, our approach is compared with the related work approaches to show its advantages.|$|R
