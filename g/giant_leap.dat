25|$|Whitworth also {{invented the}} Whitworth rifle, {{which was a}} <b>giant</b> <b>leap</b> in the {{development}} of the rifle, delivering a shooting range which far exceeded any firearm available at the time. In the American Civil War Confederate troops equipped with barrel-length three power scopes mounted on the exceptionally accurate Whitworth rifle had been known to kill Union officers at ranges of about 800 yards (731.5m), an unheard-of distance at that time. Consequently, the Whitworth rifle is considered one of the earliest examples of a sniper rifle, if not the first. In recognition of his achievements, a number of buildings in Manchester are named after him as is Whitworth Street. As part of his bequest, the Whitworth Art Gallery was created in his honour.|$|E

500|$|The Reform of 1906 was a <b>giant</b> <b>leap</b> in the {{political}} and social liberalization of the common Finnish people; the Russian royal family was the most autocratic and conservative rulers in Europe. The Finns adopted a unicameral parliamentary system with all political rights for female citizens, increasing the number of voters from 126,000 to 1,273,000. This produced around 50% turnouts for the Social Democrats, but the Czar regained his authority after the crisis of 1905, and during the second period of Russification between 1908 and 1917 [...] neutralized the power of the Parliament. He dissolved it and ordered parliamentary elections almost annually between 1908–1916, and determined the composition of the Finnish Senate, which did not correlate with the assembly of the Parliament, prohibiting true parliamentarism.|$|E

500|$|After she {{accepted}} the role, Richard {{was told by}} Julia Smith {{that she would have}} to change her appearance, to make it more in keeping with Pauline's unglamorous lifestyle. This included having her hair cut. Richard has commented, [...] "I was very proud of my long hair, which had taken me years to grow. I hadn't had it cut short for nineteen years but reluctantly, I agreed... I cried my eyes out for the rest of the day after that traumatic hair cut." [...] From September 1984, Richard was involved in pre-production of the series, covering every angle, from hair, costume design and make-up to organising the set interior of her character's screen house. Richard has said that Pauline had been given extensive biographical detail, including minute specifics, such as her fictional time of her birth: [...] "It was vital that we should get to know our own characters intimately and so the cast initially sat together in family groups to learn our lines and bond with our 'relations'... it was essential to develop the rapport that families, who'd been together for years, would naturally have." [...] Richard's casting was considered to be [...] "a <b>giant</b> <b>leap</b> of faith" [...] by co-creators Holland and Smith, but one that ultimately [...] "landed on its feet", because Pauline went on to be one of the longest running characters in EastEnders history, remaining with the show for nearly twenty-two years.|$|E

During 2002, Williams collaborated with concept band 1 <b>Giant</b> <b>Leap</b> on their single [...] "My Culture", which reached number nine in the UK.

500|$|GamePro rated it {{a perfect}} 5 out of 5 score in its March 1992 issue.

[...] In the November 1993 issue of Dragon, Sandy Petersen gave it an [...] "Excellent" [...] rating. He criticized the [...] "stylized" [...] combat system and the graphics as [...] "inferior" [...] to Zelda, but praised how every [...] "spell has a different on-screen effect" [...] and the difficulty for being [...] "just about right" [...] where bosses [...] "nearly beat you every time" [...] unlike other RPG's such as Ultima where [...] enough [...] "adventuring" [...] {{makes it possible to}} [...] "trash" [...] enemies [...] "with ease."

He stated that it is like [...] "following the storyline of a fantasy novel," [...] comparing it to The Lord of the Rings and Man in the Iron Mask, concluding that, because [...] "the characters often spoke up for themselves," [...] he [...] "got much more attached" [...] to the party [...] "than in any other computer game." ...|$|E

500|$|Modern Life Is Rubbish {{was well}} {{received}} by the British music press. NME reviewer Paul Moody was mostly enthusiastic about the record and rated it seven out of ten. While he felt the album had [...] "enough faults to give a surveyor nightmares", he was impressed that, unlike their peers, [...] "Blur [...] thrown on their old clothes and stormed into No Man's Land with all guns blazing". Moody also praised the improvement in Albarn's lyrics, which had hitherto [...] " [...] Eurovision Song Contest entries seem like great works of poetry". Qs David Roberts, in a favourable four (out of five) star review, called Modern Life [...] "an energised, infectious romp around contemporary little England, by way of an exuberant trawl through a highly-coloured patchwork of its pop past". Roberts placed Coxon as the leading contender for [...] "the vacant crown of [...] Johnny Marr". American publications also spoke favourably of Modern Life. Writing for the Chicago Tribune, rock critic Greg Kot felt the album was a vast improvement over Leisure, which he found [...] "highly derivative" [...] of the Madchester genre. [...] "Nothing on [...] prepares the listener for the adventurousness of Modern Life is Rubbish," [...] he wrote, going on to describe the album as [...] "a swirling, intoxicating song cycle that enriches superior popcraft with wiggy studio experiments." [...] Although they found the album to be [...] "overly lengthy", Billboard agreed with Kot, dubbing Modern Life [...] "a <b>giant</b> <b>leap</b> forward artistically" [...] from Leisure. St. Louis Post-Dispatch writer Paul Hampel commended Blur for having [...] "taken a bold step [...] – backward", and pointed to their attempt at [...] "a communion with past masters of smart, satirical Brit pop". He concluded his positive review of the album by calling it a [...] "series of pleasant surprises [...] offers numerous signs that great things are to come from Blur".|$|E

40|$|CONCLUSION 3 INTRODUCTION: THE SMITH FAMILY UNLOCKING OPPORTUNITIES Given that I’m {{speaking}} {{after lunch}} {{when some of}} you will be getting a little weary, I thought I would start by sharing with you a recent experience which for me ‘made the earth move’! Two weeks ago the Australian Financial Review (7 November 2003 : p 82) ran a piece titled, “It’s {{time to do the}} hard yards”. The editorial formed part of a series that was called C 21 Australia and boldly stated that we had to start taking some <b>giant</b> <b>leaps</b> if Australia was ever going to be the clever, lucky country that it once was. I was excited because this is something that certainly The Smith Family and I know, most of you in this room, have understood for some time. Yet it is only now that the penny has dropped for our friends in the media. Indeed, it was precisely this recognition that led The Smith Family, in 1999, to refocus our energies on supporting all Australians to reach their full potential by ensuring they can get an education. This recognition – that education is the key to enabling us to take those <b>giant</b> <b>leaps</b> forward – is exactly the position this particular newspaper feature was advocating...|$|R
