The song was written by executive producer Paul Rabwin, who was heavily involved in the episode's music production. Rabwin later noted, [...] "I auditioned a bunch of gospel songs [...] I told him <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>write</b> one that was better {{and he told me}} to go for it. And I did. [...] Kim loved it.

Vonnegut said his tenure with the Echo allowed him to write for a large audience—his fellow students—rather than for a teacher, an experience he said was [...] "fun and easy".

500|$|Haley {{exercised}} discretion over content, guided MalcolmX {{in critical}} stylistic and rhetorical choices, and compiled the work. In the epilogue to the Autobiography, Haley describes an agreement he made with MalcolmX, who demanded that: [...] "Nothing {{can be in}} this book's manuscript that I didn't say and nothing can be left out that I want in it." [...] As such, Haley wrote an addendum to the contract specifically referring to the book as an [...] "as told to" [...] account. In the agreement, Haley gained an [...] "important concession": [...] "I asked for—and he gave—his permission {{that at the end}} of the book <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>write</b> comments of my own about him which would not be subject to his review." [...] These comments became the epilogue to the Autobiography, which Haley wrote after the death of his subject.|$|E

As The X-Files entered its sixth season, Duchovny {{decided that it was}} an appropriate time to try writing a full episode. Before then, he had felt {{that he did not have}} the skills necessary; he said, [...] "I didn't have the surety, the confidence in my mind, that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>write</b> a teleplay...It took me to the sixth year of the show to actually sit down and write one of my ideas."

500|$|Shortly after Lincoln's assassination, Lowell {{was asked}} to present a poem at Harvard in memory of {{graduates}} killed in the war. His poem, [...] "Commemoration Ode", cost him sleep and his appetite, but was delivered on July 21, 1865, after a 48-hour writing binge. Lowell had high hopes for his performance but was overshadowed by the other notables presenting works that day, including Ralph Waldo Emerson and Oliver Wendell Holmes. [...] "I {{did not make the}} hit I expected", he wrote, [...] "and am ashamed at having been tempted again to think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>write</b> poetry, a delusion from which I have been tolerably free these dozen years." [...] Despite his personal assessment, friends and other poets sent many letters to Lowell congratulating him. Emerson referred to his poem's [...] "high thought & sentiment" [...] and James Freeman Clarke noted its [...] "grandeur of tone". Lowell later expanded it with a strophe to Lincoln.|$|E

500|$|... 20th Century Fox {{president}} Craig Baumgarten {{was impressed}} with Adam Rifkin's filmmaking with Never on Tuesday. In 1988, Rifkin was brought in the studio to pitch ideas for films. Rifkin, being {{a fan of the}} 1968 Planet of the Apes felt it was best to continue the film series. [...] "Having independent film experience, I promised <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>write</b> and direct a huge-looking film for a reasonable price and budget, like Aliens." [...] Fox commissioned Rifkin to write what amounted to a sequel, [...] "but not a sequel to the fifth film, an alternate sequel to the first film". He took influences from Spartacus, with the storyline being [...] "the ape empire had reached its Roman era. A descendant of Charlton Heston's character named Duke would eventually lead a human slave revolt against the oppressive Roman-esque apes, led by General Izan. A real sword and sandal spectacular, monkey style. Gladiator did the same movie without the ape costumes." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} the musical came from Stuart Brayson, who had been sending {{cassette}} tapes with music ideas to Tim Rice since they had first met in the 1980s, when Brayson {{was a member of}} the band Pop. In 2002, Brayson sent Rice a tape of music and lyrics to form the basis of a stage version of From Here to Eternity. Rice liked the idea but only intended to produce the show, however after Bill Oakes had been hired to write the book gaps appeared where new songs were needed and some no longer fitted within the context of the show. Rice agreed to write around six new songs, but ultimately ended up writing around 90% of the show's lyrics inspired by Brayson's original lyrics. On the subject Rice said: [...] "Stuart's were very good, but they weren't theatrical and there is a difference. I often wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>write</b> great rock lyrics, but I can't, however, I can do reasonable lyrics within the context of a show. There are people who can write good tunes, but few who can do theatrical lyrics." ...|$|E

[...] On the political nature of her songs she has said, [...] "Nobody wants to be dancing to political songs.

500|$|Sinatra's {{decline in}} {{popularity}} was evident at his concert appearances. At a brief {{run at the}} Paramount in New York he drew small audiences. At the Desert Inn in Las Vegas he performed to half-filled houses of wildcatters and ranchers. At a concert at Chez Paree in Chicago, only 150 people in a 1,200-seat capacity venue turned up to see him. By April 1952 he was performing at the Kauai County Fair in Hawaii. Sinatra's relationship with Columbia Records was also disintegrating, with A executive Mitch Miller claiming he [...] "couldn't give away" [...] the singer's records. Though several notable recordings were made during this time period, such as [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Write</b> a Book" [...] in January 1952, which Granata sees as a [...] "turning point", forecasting his later work with its sensitivity, Columbia and MCA dropped him later that year. His last studio recording for Columbia, [...] "Why Try To Change Me Now", was recorded in New York on September 17, 1952, with orchestra arranged and conducted by Percy Faith. [...] Journalist Burt Boyar observed, [...] "Sinatra had had it. It was sad. From the top to the bottom in one horrible lesson." ...|$|E
500|$|The song, {{which was}} the last one written for the album, was placed {{at the end of the}} album because it [...] "marks a new beginning" [...] for the band, {{which was the}} theme on the album and a theme in Lee's life. In the booklet of The Open Door, she stated that her long-time friend and husband, Josh Hartzler, was the main {{inspiration}} for the song. In the booklet she wrote, [...] "Josh, you are my muse. Nothing inspires me the way you do. Thank you for all my missing pieces. Thank you for your strength and love. Thank you for letting me see myself through your eyes, because only then could I know that I am good enough for you." [...] One of the band's previous singles, [...] "Bring Me to Life", was also written about Josh Hartzler. In an interview with VH1, Lee further revealed the inspiration behind the song, saying [...] "I had gone through a lot of difficult things during the writing of the whole album, and by the end of it, I had stepped away from those bad situations. That's really hard. You have to be really brave and strong about it. After doing that, I felt so amazing. For the first time I felt like <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>write</b> a song based on how good I felt. I have never done that before ever. During another interview with The Washington Post she stated: ...|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} the second {{version of the}} song, Lennon {{wanted to do something}} different with it, as Martin remembered: [...] "He'd wanted it as a gentle dreaming song, but he said it had come out too raucous. He asked me if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>write</b> him a new line-up with the strings. So I wrote a new score (with four trumpets and three cellos) and we recorded that, but he didn't like it." [...] Meanwhile, on 8 and 9 December, another basic track was recorded, using Mellotron, electric guitar, piano, backwards-recorded cymbals, and swarmandel, an Indian version of the zither. After reviewing the tapes of Martin's version and the original, Lennon told Martin that he liked both versions, although Martin had to tell Lennon that the orchestral score was at a faster tempo and in a higher key (B major) than the first version (A major). Lennon said, [...] "You can fix it, George", giving Martin and Geoff Emerick, the band's recording engineer, the difficult task of joining the two takes together. With only a pair of editing scissors, two tape machines and a vari-speed control, Emerick compensated for the differences in key and speed by increasing the speed of the first version and decreasing the speed of the second. He then spliced the versions together, starting the orchestral score {{in the middle of the}} second chorus. (Since the first version did not include a chorus after the first verse, he also spliced in the first seven words of the chorus from elsewhere in the first version.) The pitch-shifting in joining the versions gave Lennon's lead vocal a slightly other-worldly [...] "swimming" [...] quality.|$|E
