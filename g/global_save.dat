40|$|The <b>global</b> <b>Save</b> Movement, {{alongside}} {{other animal}} rights organisations and practices, has since 2010 sought {{to bring the}} experiences of nonhuman farmed animals into the public domain from privatized, usually hidden spaces of industrial procedure and slaughter. One key mechanism used is public vigils held outside slaughterhouses, where activists gather to {{bear witness to the}} passing of nonhuman animals in trucks, and to raise awareness of the suffering of animals to passersby and members of the public. Central to the practice are the roles played by emotional engagement and bodily encounter with the nonhuman animals; the movement is founded on a self-styled “love-based” compassion for other living beings, influenced by the non-violence teachings of Leo Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King. In 2014 I joined the Save Movement in Toronto for a number of their vigils, engaging in an autoethnographic study of the means by which activists employ emotional labour, bearing witness and bodily encounter in foregrounding the realities of life for industrially farmed nonhuman animals. This article argues that the rise of the Save Movement represents a new moment (although not wholly without precedent) in the practices of animal rights activism. Working from the intellectual standpoint of Critical Animal Studies and engaged theory, the structure of the paper employs ethnographic and emotionally-affected personal accounts of taking part as a researcher-activist in the vigils, which offer access to experiences {{of the ways in which}} emotion, activism and empathy overlap in ‘coming to care’ for nonhuman others in pressured public settings. The article seeks, in the end, to elucidate the Save Movement’s emphasis placed on bodily encounter and the making visible of already existing embodied entanglements with farmed nonhuman animals, and suggests this form of engaged witnessing offers opportunity for radically reimagining our species’ existing relationships with those species we currently identity as food...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to predict how demographic developments will affect the <b>Global</b> <b>Saving</b> Glut. The thesis examines how {{the changes in the}} age structure in China and the US are affecting their respective aggregate savings rates. Ben Bernanke was the first economist to mention the term <b>Global</b> <b>Saving</b> Glut, which describes an economy where desired saving exceeds desired investment. He states that the increase in the global supply of savings {{was one of the main}} reasons behind the low global real interest rates. This thesis will use an Overlapping Generation Model with seven generations overlapping in the time period from 2010 to 2060. By including numerous generations, this will provide an improved analysis and understanding of the demographic patterns and developments in both countries. In the US, the model will include the effect of the aging of the baby boomers, while in China the model will capture the long run effects of the family planning policies. From our analysis, we see an increasing number of elderly per worker in both China and the US. In line with the Life-Cycle Hypothesis, our results, therefore, project a decrease in both countries’ savings rates since more people are in the dissaving stages of their life-cycle. Also, with fewer workers per elderly, taxes will need to increase to keep the two nations’ pension systems in their current forms. In order to dampen the effects of the increase in the old-age dependency ratios, a solution can also be to increase the retirement age. Since China and the US are the two largest economies in the world, the developments in their savings rate will have large implications for the global economy and the global real interest rate. A large reduction in aggregate saving, and thereby in their current account balances, will lower the global supply of saving. As a result, these developments might increase the low global real interest rates we have been seeing over a longer period of time...|$|R

While emerging economies had exhibited some resilience through the early stages of the financial turmoil that began in the summer of 2007, they have been hit hard since mid- 2008. Their deteriorating fortunes are only partly attributable to the collapse in world trade and sharp drop in commodity prices. Things were made worse by emerging markets' exposure to the turmoil in global finance itself. As "innocent bystanders," even countries that had taken out "self-insurance" proved vulnerable to the global "sudden stop" in capital flows. We critique loanable funds theoretical interpretations of global imbalances and offer an alternative explanation that emphasizes the special status of the U. S. dollar. Instead of taking out even more self-insurance, developing countries should pursue capital account management to enlarge their policy space and reduce external vulnerabilities.

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to {{investigate}} the forces and conditions {{that led to the}} emergence of global imbalances preceding the worldwide crisis of 2007 – 09, and both the likelihood and the potential sustainability of reemerging global imbalances as the world economy recovers from that crisis. The "Bretton Woods 2 " hypothesis of sustainable global imbalances featuring a quasi-permanent U. S. current account deficit overlooked that the domestic counterpart to the United States' external deficit—soaring household indebtedness—was based not on safe debts but rather toxic ones. We critique the "global saving glut" hypothesis, and propose the "global dollar glut" hypothesis in its stead. With the U. S. private sector in retrenchment mode, the question arises whether fiscal expansion might not only succeed in filling the gap in U. S. domestic demand but also restart global arrangements along BW 2 lines, albeit this time based on public debt—call it "Bretton Woods 3. " This paper explores the chances of a BW 3 regime, highlighting the role of "dollar leveraging" in sustaining U. S. trade deficits. Longer-term prospects for a postdollar standard are discussed in the light of John Maynard Keynes’s "bancor" plan.

To <b>save</b> energy is urgent, which means that the energy losses must be reduced. In Spain it is especially important as the construction rate is almost the half of that in Europe. It’s designed a distributed solution by means of a multi-agent system, and a central control unit responsible for minimising the energy consumption. The central control unit (CCU) includes a Fuzzy Model –for estimating the energy needs- and a Fuzzy controller –to set the power rate of each heater-. The CCU is responsible for distributing the available power over the set of heaters. This solution is the preliminary study to be included in a heating system product of a local company...|$|R

The protocols that provide better accuracy rely on a timestamping mechanism which allows them to eliminate several sources of error in the time synchronization process. However, in newer platforms, such as SunSPOT, no timestamping mechanism is provided.

40|$|Traditionally, {{tightly coupled}} multiprocessors allow data sharing between {{multiple}} caches by keeping cached copies of memory blocks coherent {{with respect to}} shared memory. This is difficult to achieve in a fault tolerant environment due {{to the need to}} <b>save</b> <b>global</b> checkpoints in shared memory from where consistent cache states can be recovered after a failure. The architecture presented in this report solves this problem by encapsulating the memory modifications done by a process into an atomic transaction. Caches record dependencies between the transactions associated with processes modifying the same memory blocks. Dependent transactions may then be atomically committed. Such an operation requires a cache coherence protocol responsible for recording process dependencies as well as keeping coherent cached copies of blocks and a shared stable transactional memory owing to which all memory updates are atomic to allow recovery after a processor failure.

40|$|A {{snapshot}} algorithm gathers global {{state in}} a distributed system. Co-ordinated snapshot algorithms, such as the Chandy-Lamport algorithm, use control messages to ensure consistency of the gathered state. “Lazy snapshots” represent a generalization of Chandy-Lamport in which processes can delay recording local state and can anticipate or delay propagating control messages. In this paper, we present a new taxonomy {{of the class of}} lazy snapshot algorithms. This taxonomy precisely characterizes each variant within this class and forms a framework for a systematic investigation of the performance of each algorithmic variant. Through simulation and analysis, we quantify the tradeoff between flexibility and storage cost. We find that eagerly sending markers before recording the local state always reduces the amount of storage required to <b>save</b> <b>global</b> state. Furthermore, this approach allows processes modest flexibility in deciding when to record the local state. Conversely, lazily recording the local state provides significant flexibility but can increase the amount of storage needed. In light of this tradeoff, we present a new hybrid algorithm that blends these strengths...|$|R
