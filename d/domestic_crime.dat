The receiving organization needs to find a way that these get into usable bank accounts, so they can be accessed for large purchases.|$|E

40|$|The paper assesses three {{approaches}} to domestic violence: two {{that use the}} concept of ‘coercive control’ and one that uses ‘domestic violent crime’. These are: Stark’s concept of coercive control; Johnson’s distinction between situational couple violence and intimate terrorism, in which coercive control is confined to the latter; and that of <b>domestic</b> violent <b>crime,</b> in which all physical violence is conceptualised as coercive and controlling. The paper assesses these three approaches on seven issues. It offers original analysis of data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales concerning variations in repetition and seriousness in <b>domestic</b> violent <b>crime.</b> It links escalation in <b>domestic</b> violent <b>crime</b> to variations in the economic resources of the victim. It concludes {{that the concept of}} <b>domestic</b> violent <b>crime</b> is preferable to that of coercive control when seeking to explain variations in domestic violence...|$|R

50|$|Offences, {{that are}} {{committed}} {{in accordance with}} § 130 of the Criminal Code abroad, whether by German nationals or foreigners, can be pursued as a <b>domestic</b> <b>crime,</b> when they so act, {{as if they had}} been committed within the country, affecting the public peace in Germany and violate the human dignity of German citizens. It is sufficient, for example, that criminal content on the Internet, for example in the form of a HTML page, can be accessed from Germany. Hence, for example, the jurisdiction of German courts can be applied for offences of sedition (Volksverhetzungsdelikte) committed abroad. Such an example, was the conviction of the Holocaust denier Ernst Zundel by the District Court of Mannheim in February 2007, who was convicted of inciting propaganda, that he had published from the US and Canada on the Internet.|$|E
5000|$|Greek crime bosses are locally {{described}} as νονοί της νύχτας (translated as [...] "Godfathers of the night"). Largely operating as owners of nightclubs, Greek crime groups {{are able to}} operate their illegal businesses from there on. In contrast to the Sicilian mafia or the Albanian mafia, Greek criminal groups follow the same structure organized gangs have within the French Milieu or the Penose in the Netherlands. Domestically, they are largely smaller organized crime cells, sometimes family-based, who collaborate but {{from time to time}} also feud with one another. There are close to 217 known <b>domestic</b> <b>crime</b> lords operating in the country. Internationally, the smuggling and racketeering practices have a larger reach, and are not necessarily based on Greek nationals alone. With the need to infiltrate and manipulate multiple types of businesses in order to successfully smuggle internationally, more often than not such organisations resemble professional international cartels rather than traditional organised crime groups.|$|E

The global financial crises, energy crises, <b>domestic</b> <b>crime</b> and violence further escalated while Musharraf made desperate attempts to contain the political pressure. Stepping down from the military, Musharraf was sworn in for a second presidential term on 28 November 2007.Popular support for Musharraf declined when Nawaz Sharif, this time accompanied by his younger brother and his daughter, successfully made a second attempt to return from exile; hundreds of their supporters, including a few leaders of their party were detained before the pair arrived at Iqbal Terminal, on 25 November 2007. Nawaz Sharif filed his nomination papers for two seats in the forthcoming elections whilst Benazir Bhutto filed for three seats including one of the reserved seats for women. Departing an election rally in Rawalpindi on 27 December 2007, Benazir Bhutto was assassinated by a gunman who shot her in the neck and set off a bomb, killing 20 other people and injuring several more. The exact sequence of the events and cause of death became points of political debate and controversy, because, although early reports indicated that Benazir Bhutto was hit by shrapnel or the gunshots, the Pakistan Interior ministry maintained that her death was due from a skull fracture sustained when the explosive waves threw her against the sunroof of her vehicle. The issue remains controversial and the investigations were further conducted by British Scotland Yard. After a meeting in Islamabad, the Election Commission announced that, due to the assassination, the elections, which had been scheduled for 8 January 2008, would take place on 18 February.The 2008 general elections marked the return of the leftists in the country's power politics, on 18 February 2008. The left oriented, PPP, and conservative PML, won majority of seats together in the election and formed a coalition government; the liberal alliance then finally faded. Yousaf Raza Gillani of PPP became the Prime minister and consolidated his power after ending a policy deadlock in order to lead the movement to impeach the president on 7 August 2008. Before restoring the deposed judiciary, Gillani and his leftist alliance leveled accusation against Musharraf for weakening Pakistan's unity, violating its constitution and creating economic impasse. As momentum on Musharraf gained, President Musharraf began consultations with his close aides on the implications of the impeachment and readily made available himself to reply to the charges levied upon him. Gillani's effective strategy to force Musharraf from presidency succeeded when Pervez Musharraf announced in a very short long televised address to the nation to announce his resignation, ending his nine-year-long reign on 18 August 2008.|$|E

40|$|Transnational crime, {{sometimes}} called international crime or multinational systemic crime, {{is more than}} an extension of <b>domestic</b> <b>crime.</b> In the context of globalization, transnational organized crime groups respond to market incentives and operate with cooperative relationships, which makes the multinational criminal systems become more efficient and powerful. As a result, no single country has the capability to prevent and control different kinds of transnational crime. Moreover, the containment of transnational crime through international cooperation may be an ideal way. However, there are some great challenges for international cooperation, such as different national interests and the trend of westernization. Accordingly, international cooperation should have to concern the social context and national interests of each country...|$|E

40|$|Does {{immigration}} cause crime? To answer this question, we build a two-country {{general equilibrium model}} with search costs in which the migration (in/out-) ‡ows, the crime rates and the equilibrium wages {{in the two countries}} are determined by the interaction between the labor market, the crime market and the decision to migrate. The main result of our model is that, in equilibrium, the relationship between immigration and crime depends on the conditions of both the labor and crime markets of the two countries. In particular, when the tightness of the labor market is su ¢ ciently elastic relative to that of the crime market, {{immigration cause}}s a reduction in the <b>domestic</b> <b>crime</b> rate of the host country. An implication of this result is that migration ‡ows from countries with strong work rigidities to societies characterized by more elastic labor markets are mutually bene…c in terms of reducing the corresponding crime rates...|$|E
