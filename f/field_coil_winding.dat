One {{of the critical}} components of the coil is the electrical joint connecting either two conductor lengths within a double pancake or two double pancakes. All joints utilize the twin-box “shaking hands” concept. It has previously been found with the JackPot-AC numerical model that in these joints {{the sum of the}} transport and induced currents in some of the superconducting strands during coil operation may exceed the strands' critical current. It was decided to further explore the behavior of the joint with a simplified set of current and magnetic field runs. A solution for the reduction of the induced currents is proposed and verified by modeling. The paper discusses the results of the simulations and gives recommendations for the joint design...|$|E

40|$|A new helical system(""Modular Heliotron"") with {{improved}} modular coils compatible with efficient closed helical divertor and good plasma confinement property is proposed {{based on a}} Heliotron system with continuous helical coils and one pair of poloidal coils. The physics optimization of this system {{as a function of}} the gap angle between adjacent modular coils has been carried out by means of vacuum magnetic surface calculations and finite-beta plasma analyses, and a new improved coil system is invented by combining sectored helical <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> with sectored returning poloidal <b>field</b> <b>coils.</b> The Modular Heliotron with standard <b>coil</b> <b>winding</b> law (reference Modular Heliotron) was previously proposed, but it is found that this is not appropriate to keep clean helical divertor and high beta configuration when the coil gap becomes large. By modulating the modular <b>coil</b> <b>winding</b> with outside-plus and inside-minus pitch modulation, almost the same good magnetic configuration as that of a conventional Heliotron can be produced. The optimal gap angle is determined {{as a function of the}} modulation parameter. This improved Modular Heliotron permits larger gap angle between adjacent modules and produces more clean helical divertor configuration than the reference Modular Heliotron. All these helical system are created by only modular coils without poloidal coils. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} integrity of superconducting magnets that are {{key elements of}} a fusion reactor must be ensured. At an early design stage relatively simple calculation tools can greatly facilitate design optimization. The main objective {{of this paper is}} the mechanical pre-dimensioning of the tokamak toroidal <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> by simple means prior to the global 3 D numerical modeling. A semi-analytical calculation tool that reasonably estimates the static strength of the toroidal <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> under the electromagnetic forces at the critical location (inner leg equatorial plane) is described. The novelty of the approach is that it treats not only the massive coil casing but also the winding pack conductor jacket under an essentially 3 D stress state. The calculation tool features pre-optimization of the <b>coil</b> <b>winding</b> for graded layered winding layouts. The minimum space (radial built) required for the coil inboard portion that is a key design parameter is defined after possible winding pre-optimization. The procedure has been successfully benchmarked against numerical solutions and has been used for pre-dimensioning the toroidal coils in the frame of the current 2015 DEMO activity...|$|R

The stainless steel coil housings are completely covered by copper sheet segments which are {{fixed to the}} surface by spot welding. A stainless steel cooling tube is soldered to this sheathing via suitable copper profile blocks {{on top of the}} outer housing circumference. Essentially, the cool-down of the coils including the adjoining structure is performed via the housings since the flow resistance of the cable-in-conduit-conductor would be too high. Moreover, the housing cooling during steady-state operation prevents heat incidence form outside to the <b>coil</b> <b>winding.</b> Conductor cooling is primarily used to stabilize the superconductor and to remove heat from inside the cable.

40|$|Abstract — The <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> is {{the primary}} {{component}} of the rotor assembly that provides the rotating magnetic field for the pulse power alternator. The design of the <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> is optimized {{so that it will}} produce the required magnetic field with minimum transient losses. The high currents required to produce the correct amp-turns, along with the mechanical loads due to high rotational speeds, present further design requirements for selection of <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> material, insulation, and surrounding material that completes the matrix of the <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> sub-assembly. With the addition of active cooling requirements in the <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> design, surrounding materials must be selected that retain electrically insulative properties and are thermally conductive to allow sufficient heat removal from the <b>field</b> <b>coil.</b> Thermoplastics are now being reviewed to replace traditional glass-epoxy potting compounds (thermosets) that have been used extensively in pulsed alternator designs. Fillers can be added to tailor properties of the thermoplastic, such as ceramics to increase thermal conductivity at the cost of an increase in density. Thermal analyses have been performed that show the benefits of using thermally conductive potting compounds. In addition, subscale <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> mock-ups (motorettes) have been encapsulated and tested to demonstrate encapsulation of current <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> geometries. I...|$|R
40|$|Because of its ambitious goals, the DEMO project faces many {{technical}} challenges. The mechanical {{performance of}} the superconducting toroidal <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> (TFC) system is mostly determined by the high electromagnetic forces. A structural evaluation of the TFC of the EU DEMO 2014 / 2015 baseline configurations is presented. The emphasis {{is focused on the}} parametric study with the use of simplified numerical modeling. Physical interpretation of the numerical results makes the system mechanical behavior transparent and directly leads to the design recommendations. An express approach is proposed to reconstruct the detailed conductor stress state from the homogenized winding. This allows for sorting out the WP designs with respect to their robustness against acceptance criteria while giving a way for their improvement. An analysis workflow for the TFC system stress analysis is proposed. The main features of a semianalytical procedure allowing for the coil predimensioning prior to the 3 -D numerical simulations are highlighted.

40|$|The role of inter-bundle {{resistive}} barriers (metal sheet wraps), {{introduced to}} reduce the inter-bundle coupling loss in multistage cabled Cable-In-Conduit Conductors (CICC) for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) is evaluated, based on results gained recently on short sample experiments in the Twente Cable Press and SULTAN. The obvious benefit of limiting the inter bundle coupling loss unavoidably goes together with impeding the redistribution of nonuniform currents in the <b>coil</b> <b>winding</b> introduced at the terminations, as well as reduction of the heat exchange between the bundles. Six-element numerical electromagnetic code simulations are presented that qualitatively explain the effect of wraps on the DC performance, strongly depending on the testing geometry. The computations illustrate that wraps can reduce the DC performance in short sample tests. At the same time simulations of the Poloidal <b>Field</b> <b>Coil</b> Insert (PFCI), with a winding length of 50 m, have shown that omitting sub-stage wraps, can even degrade the DC performance of coils due to the short current transfer length in combination with current nonuniformity causing peak voltages in the most overloaded petals...|$|R

However, reactors will require further advances in configuration design, in particular with regard to maintenance and operational characteristics, in order to have high availability.
