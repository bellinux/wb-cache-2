5000|$|Spearfishing {{has been}} implicated in local disappearances of some species, {{including}} the Atlantic goliath grouper on the Caribbean island of Bonaire, the Nassau grouper in the barrier reef {{off the coast of}} Belize and the <b>giant</b> black <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> in California, which have all been listed as endangered. Modern Spearfishing has shifted focus onto catching only what one needs and targeting sustainable fisheries. As gear evolved in the 1960s and 1970s spearfishermen typically viewed the ocean as an unlimited resource and often sold their catch. This practise is now heavily frowned upon in prominent spearfishing nations for promoting unsustainable methods and encouraging taking more fish than is needed.In countries such as Australia and South Africa where the activity is regulated by state fisheries, spearfishing {{has been found to be}} the most environmentally friendly form of fishing due to being highly selective, having no by-catch, causing no habitat damage, nor creating pollution or harm to protected endangered species. [...] In 2007, the Australian Bluewater Freediving Classic became the first spearfishing tournament to be accredited and was awarded 4 out of 5 stars based on environmental, social, safety and economic indicators.|$|R

40|$|Recent tagging studies {{indicate}} that black <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> movements are regional rather than coast wide. The tagging data will be considered when considering management objectives.

This is important for Maryland since black <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> support vital recreational and commercial coastal fisheries. The majority of black <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> are caught in federal waters (> 3 nautical miles offshore) where natural hard bottom and cold water corals can be found. The coastwide stock was declared rebuilt in 2010. However, data suggest that a regional management program may be more appropriate for black <b>sea</b> <b>bass.</b> The Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic Coast Black <b>Sea</b> <b>Bass</b> Fishery Management Plan (CB FMP) was adopted in 1996.

40|$|In higher vertebrates, anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is {{required}} for Müllerian duct regression in fetal males. AMH is also produced during postnatal life in both sexes regulating steroidogenesis and early stages of folliculogenesis. Teleosts lack Müllerian ducts, but Amh has been identified in several species including European <b>sea</b> <b>bass.</b> However, information on Amh type- 2 receptor (Amhr 2), the specific receptor for Amh binding, is restricted {{to a couple of}} fish species. Here, we report on cloning <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> amhr 2, the production of a recombinant <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> Amh, and the functional analysis of this ligand-receptor couple. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> amhr 2 segregates with Amhr 2 from other vertebrates. This piscine receptor is capable of activating Smad proteins.

50|$|The diet of {{the fish}} is {{composed}} of invertebrates, including marine worms, bryozoans, crustaceans, dove snails, limpets, fish larvae, and squid. It may consume small amounts of seaweed. It also feeds on the ectoparasites of other fish. The señorita is a cleaner wrasse, a fish that grooms the parasites and other materials off the bodies of other fish. It may remove and eat ectoparasites such as bacteria, copepods, and isopods. Parasites can constitute around half its total food intake. Sometimes when the señorita begins to clean one of its clients, a crowd of other fish will gather around to receive the service. Species that seek the señorita for a grooming include the bat ray (Myliobatis californica), <b>giant</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> (Stereolepis gigas), kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus), jacksmelt (Atherinopsis californiensis), topsmelt (Atherinops affinis), sargo (Diplodus sargus), blacksmith (Chromis punctipinnis), garibaldi (Hypsypops rubicundus), opaleye (Girella nigricans), halfmoon (Medialuna californiensis), and mola (Mola mola). The other fish may solicit the cleaning with their behavior. The garibaldi extends its gill slits to give the señorita access to parasites on its gills. The blacksmith points its head down to encourage the cleaner, and many blacksmith at a time may mob it, competing for its attention. They may even block its escape if it tries to leave the scene. The opaleye is usually constantly swimming, but it will stop and hold still if it meets a señorita. The kelp bass, a predator of small fish, will often refrain from eating the señorita, and let it clean. While the señorita will often clean large, predatory fish, {{it is not always}} safe. It has been observed in the diet of the kelp bass, the bocaccio (Sebastes paucispinis), and the starry rockfish (S. constellatus), but it is not consumed as often as would be expected, considering its frequent close contact with predators. It might be unpalatable. Predators that do eat the fish include Brandt's cormorant (Phalacrocorax penicillatus) and the California sea lion (Zalophus californianus).|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{selective}} breeding of fish for aquaculture purposes requires {{the understanding of}} the genetic basis of traits such as growth, behaviour, resistance to pathogens and sex determinism.

Having this aim in mind, a radiation hybrid (RH) panel of European <b>sea</b> <b>bass</b> (Dicentrarchus labrax) was constructed from splenocytes irradiated at 3000 rad, allowing the construction of a 1581 marker RH map. A total of 1440 gene markers providing ~ 4400 anchors with the genomes of three-spined stickleback, medaka, pufferfish and zebrafish, helped establish synteny relationships with these model species.
