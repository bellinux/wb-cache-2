25|$|The {{generation}} of artists after the pioneers, active during the Late Archaic period (circa 500 to 470 BC) brought the style {{to a new}} flourish. During this time, black-figure vases failed to reach the same quality and were pushed {{out of the market}} eventually. Some of the most famous Attic vase painters belong to this generation. They include the Berlin Painter, the Kleophrades Painter, and among the bowl painters Onesimos, Douris, Makron and the Brygos Painter. The <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> went along with a doubling of output during this period. Athens became the dominant producer of fine pottery in the Mediterranean world, overshadowing nearly all other production centres.|$|E

25|$|The {{maintenance}} and <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> of life during the menopausal period {{is at the}} core of estrogen and progestin-based hormone therapy. Both HRT and estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) have been shown to enhance sexual desire in a significant percent of women; however, as with all pharmacological treatments, not all women have been responsive, especially those with preexisting sexual difficulties. ERT restores vaginal cells, pH levels, and blood flow to the vagina, all of which deterioration are associated with the onset of menopause. Dyspareunia (due to vaginal dryness) appears to be the most responsive component of menopausal women’s sexuality to ERT. It also has been shown to have positive effects on the urinary tract and atrophy and may initially improve libido or sexual sensitivity. Other improvements in areas such as sexual desire, arousal, fantasies, and frequency of coitus and orgasm have also been noted. However, the effectiveness of ERT has been shown to decline in some women after long-term use. A number of studies have found that the combined effects of estrogen/androgen replacement therapy can increase a woman’s motivational aspects of sexual behaviour over and above what can be achieved with estrogen therapy alone. Findings on a relatively new form of HRT called tibolone— a synthetic steroid with estrogenic, androgenic, and progestogenic properties— suggest that it has the ability to improve mood, libido, and somatic symptoms of surgically menopausal women to a greater degree than ERT. In various placebo-controlled studies, improvements in vasomotor symptoms, emotional reactions, sleep disturbances, somatic symptoms, and sexual desire have been observed. However, while this is and has been available in Europe for almost two decades, this has not been approved for use in North America at this point.|$|E

In four double-blind studies sertraline was shown to be superior to placebo for the treatment of panic disorder. The response rate was independent of the dose. In addition to decreasing the frequency of panic attacks by about 80% (vs. 45% for placebo) and decreasing general anxiety, sertraline resulted in <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> of life on most parameters. The patients rated as [...] "improved" [...] on sertraline reported better quality of life than the ones who [...] "improved" [...] on placebo. The authors of the study argued that the improvement achieved with sertraline is different and of a better quality than the improvement achieved with placebo. Sertraline was equally effective for men and women. While imprecise, comparison of the results of trials of sertraline with separate trials of other anti-panic agents (clomipramine, imipramine, clonazepam, alprazolam, fluvoxamine and paroxetine) indicates approximate equivalence of these medications.|$|E

Complaints that are received about health services in house nursing Bhakti Asih Hospital in high frequencies, if it is not improved hence the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the service will degrade. Thus it is necessary to conduct a research about consumer satisfaction in order to improve the service quality provided by Bhakti Asih Hospital with the implementation of Six Sigmamethod. The <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>quality</b> health services in house nursing after the implementation of Six Sigma method covers five dimensions <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> service that is tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurances, and emphaty.
