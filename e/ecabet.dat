This {{study was designed}} to evaluate the clinical efficacy of <b>ecabet</b> sodium on dyspeptic symptoms and to elucidate the molecular mechanism attributable to symptom relief in patients with chronic gastritis. Two hundred and sixty eight chronic gastritis patients with persistent dyspepsia received <b>ecabet</b> sodium 1 g b. i. d. for 2 weeks, after which dyspeptic symptoms were reassessed with a questionnaires as before. The changes of interleukin- 8 (IL- 8), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in gastric juices were measured by ELISA. The changes of nitrotyrosine in gastric mucosa were measured by immunohistochemical staining. The most common dyspeptic symptom in Korean patients with chronic gastritis was epigastric soreness (76. 8 %), which was improved significantly after <b>ecabet</b> sodium treatment (81. 7 %, p< 0. 001). <b>Ecabet</b> sodium was more effective in patients with epigastric pain than vague abdominal discomfort (p = 0. 02), especially in patients with old age. Complete relief of discomfort was more highly achieved in patients with positive Helicobacter pylori than without (p = 0. 01). In spite of clear tendency that the decreased levels of IL- 8, iNOS, and PGE 2 and increased levels of VEGF were measured in gastric juices after <b>ecabet</b> sodium treatment, no statistical significance was noted, which might be due to high inter-individual variations. The nitrotyrosine expressions were significantly decreased after <b>ecabet</b> sodium treatment than before (p< 0. 01). In conclusion, <b>ecabet</b> sodium treatment was very useful for the relief of dyspeptic symptoms in chronic gastritis, to which both attenuated inflammatory and enhanced regenerative mechanisms were contributive...|$|E

40|$|AIMS—The {{effects of}} three drugs for the {{treatment}} of gastritis and gastric ulcer—gefarnate, <b>ecabet</b> sodium, and troxipide—on periodic acid Schiff (PAS) positive cell density in rabbit conjunctiva in vivo were investigated.  METHODS—Eye drops containing gefarnate (0. 1 %, 1 %), <b>ecabet</b> sodium (0. 1 %, 1 %), or troxipide (0. 1 %, 1 %) were instilled in both eyes of rabbits, six times a day for 7  days. On the eighth day, filter paper was gently pressed on the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva, and impression cytology was performed with PAS staining. Three points in each specimen were selected randomly, and PAS stained cells were counted.  RESULTS—The instillation of gefarnate increased PAS positive cell density significantly at the concentration of 1 % (p < 0. 05). In contrast, instillation of <b>ecabet</b> sodium or troxipide failed to change PAS positive cell density.  CONCLUSIONS—These results demonstrated that gefarnate stimulates PAS positive cell density in rabbit conjunctiva.    Keywords: gefarnate; goblet cell; mucin; conjunctiva; rabbi...|$|E
40|$|Helicobacter pylori NCTC 11637, {{which is}} nonviable at pH 3. 0, became viable after {{addition}} of 10 mM urea owing to ammonia production by urease. In a buffer supplemented with urea, <b>ecabet</b> sodium decreased both {{the production of}} ammonia {{and the number of}} viable cells of H. pylori NCTC 11637 and changed the bacteria from the bacilliform to the horseshoe or doughnut shape in a concentration-dependent manner. In particular, <b>ecabet</b> sodium (2 and 4 mg/ml) decreased the number of viable cells below the control level. Benzohydroxamic acid, a urease inhibitor, also caused a decrease in ammonia production accompanied by a {{decrease in the number of}} viable cells and changed the morphological form at pH 3. 0, but the number of viable cells was not lowered below the control level. In buffers at various pHs without urea, <b>ecabet</b> sodium showed a concentration-dependent bactericidal effect on H. pylori at pHs 4. 0 and 5. 0 but not at pHs 6. 0 and 7. 0 while benzohydroxamic acid caused only a slight decrease in the number of viable cells at pH 4. 0. These results suggest that <b>ecabet</b> sodium has strong bactericidal activity in addition to its urease-inhibiting activity under acidic conditions. Helicobacter pylori, first isolated from the gastric mucosa of gastritic patients (32), has been associated with various upper gastrointestinal tract disorders, such as chronic gastritis, peptic ulceration, duodenal ulceration, and gastric cancer (7, 8, 27, 28...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} whether adding <b>ecabet</b> sodium {{to the standard}} triple therapy for H pylori infection improve eradication rate. METHODS: Two hundred and fifty-seven H pylori-infected patients {{were randomly assigned to}} standard triple therapy (group A, n = 129) or triple therapy plus <b>ecabet</b> sodium (group B, n = 128). Successful eradication was defined as a negative 13 C-urea breath test 6 - 8 wk after completion of treatment. RESULTS: After completion of therapy, 194 / 257 patients showed negative 13 C-urea breath test results. According to intention-to-treat analysis, the infection was eradicated in 93 / 129 (72. 1 %) patients in group A and 101 / 128 (78. 9 %) in group B (P = 0. 204). Per-protocol analysis showed successful eradication in 93 / 118 (78. 8 %) patients from group A and 101 / 114 (88. 6 %) from group B (P = 0. 044). There {{were no significant differences in}} the side effects experienced by the patients in the two treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the addition of <b>ecabet</b> sodium improves the efficacy of the standard triple therapy for H pylori...|$|E

40|$|Eradication {{therapy has}} been {{incorporated}} into clinical practice. The regimens currently recommended for first-line treatment include a 2 -week bismuth-based triple therapy (mainly in developing countries), a 1 - 2 week proton pump inhibitor (PPI) -based triple therapy and a 1 -week ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC) -based triple therapy. However, these regimens fail to eradicate Helicobacter pylori in up to 20 % of patients due to poor compliance, inadequate treatment duration, smoking, old age and bacterial resistance to nitroimidazoles and/or macrolides in particular. Therefore, alternative regimens that avoid nitroimidazoles and/or macrolides or overcome bacterial resistance to these drugs, improve compliance, minimise side effects and/or reduce costs have been evaluated. One-week quadruple therapy, which adds a PPI or histamine receptor 2 -blocker to bismuth-based triple therapy, usually achieves an eradication rate of 90 % when used as an alternative first-line therapy but the efficacy decreases when used as a rescue therapy. Several new triple therapies {{that may be used}} as alternative and/or rescue therapies have been evaluated. Among these are furazolidone-based (furazolidone plus an antibiotic and a bismuth salt, a PPI or RBC), fluoroquinolone-based (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin plus an antibiotic and a PPI) and <b>ecabet</b> sodium-based (<b>ecabet</b> plus two antibiotics) triple therapies. Recently, rifabutin has been used in combination with a PPI and amoxycillin as a rescue therapy, with satisfactory eradication rates. In addition, a number of new antimicrobial agents are currently under investigation in in vitro studies but the clinical values of these agents needs to be confirmed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Distal colitis (DC) can be {{effectively}} treated with topical 5 ASA agents. Suppositories target the rectum while enemas can reliably reach the splenic flexure. Used {{in combination with}} oral 5 ASAs, {{the control of the}} inflammation is even more effective. Unfortunately, resistant DC does occur and can be extremely challenging to manage. In these patients, the use of steroids, immunosuppressants and the anti-tumor necrosis factor α agents are often required. These, however, can be associated with systemic side effects and are not always effective. The investigation of new topical therapeutic agents is thus required as they are rarely associated with significant blood drug levels and side effects are infrequent. Some of the agents that have been proposed for use in resistant distal colitis include butyrate, cyclosporine and nicotine enemas as well as tacrolimus suppositories and tacrolimus, <b>ecabet</b> sodium, arsenic, lidocaine, rebamipide and Ridogrel® enemas. Some of these agents have demonstrated impressive results but the majority of the agents have only been assessed in small open-labelled patient cohorts. Further work is thus required with the investigation of promising agents in the context of randomized double-blinded placebo controlled trials. This review aims to highlight those potentially effective therapies in the management of resistant distal colitis and to promote interest in furthering their investigation...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{explore the}} {{pathological}} {{findings in the}} entire esophagus in rats with reflux esophagitis, {{and the effects of}} <b>ecabet</b> sodium (ES). METHODS: A rat model of chronic acid reflux esophagitis was used. In the treatment group, ES was administered after surgery (n = 16). No drug was administered postoperatively to the esophagitis group (n = 9). Sham-operated rats were used as a control group (n = 5). Rats were sacrificed on day 7 after the operation. The epithelial thickness and leukocyte infiltration were examined in the upper, middle and lower areas of the esophagus. The survival rate, incidence of esophageal ulcer, and mean surface area and number of esophageal ulcers were determined in the esophagitis and ES groups. Esophageal histology was assessed in all three groups. RESULTS: Leukocyte infiltration in the esophagitis group was 26. 3 ± 22. 0 in the middle esophagus and 8. 2 ± 4. 9 in the upper esophagus, which was significantly greater than that in the controls (1. 3 ± 1. 1 and 1. 4 ± 1. 0, respectively) (P < 0. 05). The thickness of the epithelium in the esophagitis group was 210. 8 ± 47. 7 μm in the lower esophagus and 204. 2 ± 60. 1 μm in the middle esophagus, which was significantly greater than that in the controls (26. 0 ± 5. 5 and 21. 0 ± 6. 5 μm, respectively) (P < 0. 05). The mean number of ulcers per animal in the ES group in the entire esophagus was 5. 4 ± 2. 5, which was significantly less than that in the esophagitis group (9. 0 ± 3. 5) (P < 0. 05). The epithelial thickness in the ES group was 97. 5 ± 32. 2 μm in the lower esophagus, which was decreased compared with that in the esophagitis group (210. 8 ± 47. 7 μm) (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Mucosal inflammation extended to the upper esophagus close to the hypopharynx. Our study suggested that ES may have a useful defensive role in reflux esophagitis...|$|E
