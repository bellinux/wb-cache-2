50|$|Stromboli was {{designed}} by the Chief Engineer of the United States Navy, Captain William W. Wood, who supervised her construction at New Haven, CT, by Samuel M. Pook. The contract for her construction was dated 1 June 1864. Confirmed records of her launching and commissioning have not been found - though period records indicate that she was completed in only three months. On 19 November 1864, the boat was renamed Spuyten Duyvil. On 25 November 1864, she successfully fired two torpedoes. Late in November 1864, Commodore Charles Stewart Boggs was placed in charge of Spuyten Duyvil, Picket Boat No. 6, and steam tug John T. Jenkins which had been chartered to tow the former vessels to Hampton Roads, VA. Upon arriving at Baltimore, MD on 2 December, Boggs turned the vessels over to Commodore T. A. Dornin who placed them under <b>First</b> Assistant <b>Engineer</b> John <b>L.</b> Lay {{for the remainder of}} the trip to Hampton Roads. The vessels arrived at Norfolk, VA on 5 December.|$|R

40|$|Lactococcus lactis are {{intensely}} {{being studied}} for the oral delivery of vaccines and other therapeutics to the mucosa of the gastrointesintal tract (GIT). In this thesis, we explore {{a new development}} by applying microencapsulation technology. A comparative study of the viability and protein secretion of free and alginate-poly-l-lysine-alginate (APA) encapsulated <b>engineered</b> <b>L.</b> lactis has demonstrated {{the effectiveness of this}} new system. The viability of microcapsules in in vitro culture conditions and simulated gastrointestinal (SGI) environments was also investigated. The latter condition exhibited inferior survival, and the attributing factors were identified. Subsequently, a novel system for the sustained delivery of a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody targeting the human pathogen Helicobacter pylori has been developed using microencapsulated genetically <b>engineered</b> <b>L.</b> lactis cells. Studies herein demonstrate the sustained viability and protein secretion of the system showing the therapeutic potential to this approach. Additional studies are required, specifically, in vivo evaluation in experimental animals...|$|R

50|$|This {{engine was}} {{designed}} by consultant Chief <b>Engineer</b> <b>L</b> H Pomeroy (1883-1941) to achieve high power with quietness and, particularly, smoothness. Pomeroy made the engine by taking the cylinder blocks of two existing 25/85 hp Daimler engines and putting them on a common crankcase. Pomeroy was to be appointed managing director in 1929. The same design was produced in different sizes depending on the different engine displacements.|$|R
