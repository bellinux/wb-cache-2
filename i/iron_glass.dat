During successive exhibitions in the same area, more structures were added. The centrepiece triumphal arch was erected in 1905 replacing a previous temporary version of the arcade by Gédéon Bordiau. The structures were built in <b>iron,</b> <b>glass</b> and stone, symbolising the economic and industrial performance of Belgium. The surrounding 30-hectare park esplanade was full of picturesque gardens, ponds and waterfalls. It housed several trade fairs, exhibitions and festivals {{at the beginning of}} the century.

6000|$|Of course, he was {{too great}} {{a man to be}} {{questioned}} as to his motives, even by his intimates. The outside world was at liberty to wonder respectfully at the hidden meaning of his actions. He was so great a man that his lavish patronage of the [...] "purer forms of Christianity" [...] (which in its naive form of church-building amused Mrs. Gould) was looked upon by his fellow-citizens as the manifestation of a pious and humble spirit. But in his own circles of the financial world the taking up of such a thing as the San Tome mine was regarded with respect, indeed, but rather as a subject for discreet jocularity. It was a great man's caprice. In the great Holroyd building (an enormous pile of <b>iron,</b> <b>glass,</b> and blocks of stone at the corner of two streets, cobwebbed aloft by the radiation of telegraph wires) the heads of principal departments exchanged humorous glances, which meant that they were not let into the secrets of the San Tome business. The Costaguana mail (it was never large--one fairly heavy envelope) was taken unopened straight into the great man's room, and no instructions dealing with it had ever been issued thence. The office whispered that he answered personally--and not by dictation either, but actually writing in his own hand, with pen and ink, and, it was to be supposed, taking a copy in his own private press copy-book, inaccessible to profane eyes. Some scornful young men, insignificant pieces of minor machinery in that eleven-storey-high workshop of great affairs, expressed frankly their private opinion that the great chief had done at last something silly, and was ashamed of his folly; others, elderly and insignificant, but full of romantic reverence for the business that had devoured their best years, used to mutter darkly and knowingly that this was a portentous sign; that the Holroyd connection meant by-and-by to get hold of the whole Republic of Costaguana, lock, stock, and barrel. But, in fact, the hobby theory was the right one. It interested the great man to attend personally to the San Tome mine; it interested him so much that he allowed this hobby to give a direction to the first complete holiday he had taken for quite a startling number of years. He was not running a great enterprise there; no mere railway board or industrial corporation. He was running a man! A success would have pleased him very much on refreshingly novel grounds; but, {{on the other side of}} the same feeling, it was incumbent upon him to cast it off utterly at the first sign of failure. A man may be thrown off. The papers had unfortunately trumpeted all over the land his journey to Costaguana. If he was pleased at the way Charles Gould was going on, he infused an added grimness into his assurances of support. Even at the very last interview, half an hour or so before he rolled out of the patio, hat in hand, behind Mrs. Gould's white mules, he had said in Charles's room-- ...|$|E

Mössbauer, IR, and {{electrical}} conductivity were investigated in <b>iron</b> phosphate <b>glasses,</b> 40 Fe 2 O 3 – 60 P 2 O 5 (in mol%), containing sulfur ranging from 0 to 2, 4, 6, and 8 mass%. Sulfur proved {{to act as}} a reducing agent for the redox reaction during the glass preparation. Mössbauer spectroscopy was used {{in order to determine the}} relative fraction of Fe 2 +, i. e. Fe 2 +/Fe(total), isomer shift (δ), and quadrupole splitting (). Mössbauer results revealed that the relative fraction of Fe 2 + increases with an increasing sulfur content. Electrical conductivity showed a similar composition dependency as the fraction of Fe 2 +. These results indicate that higher electrical conductivity of sulfur-containing <b>iron</b> phosphate <b>glasses</b> is due to small polaron hopping (SPH) between iron atoms of different valance states, i. e., a step-by-step electron hopping from Fe 2 + to Fe 3 +. IR spectra of these glasses are very similar to those of sulfur-free <b>iron</b> phosphate <b>glasses,</b> proving that the structure of sulfur-containing <b>iron</b> phosphate <b>glasses</b> is essentially the same as that of sulfur-free phosphate <b>glasses.</b> Key words: <b>iron</b> phosphate <b>glasses,</b> sulfur, Mössbauer, IR, dc conductivity. 1...|$|R

6000|$|... 28. Meanwhile, I {{have but}} one word to say, in conclusion. Whatever has been {{advanced}} {{in the course}} of this evening, has rested on the assumption that all architecture was to be of brick and stone; and may meet with some hesitation in its acceptance, on account of the probable use of <b>iron,</b> <b>glass,</b> and such other materials in our future edifices. I cannot now enter into any statement of the possible uses of iron or glass, but I will give you one reason, which I think will weigh strongly with most here, why it is not likely that they will ever become important elements in architectural effect. I know that I am speaking to a company of philosophers, but you are not philosophers of the kind who suppose that the Bible is a superannuated book; neither are you of those who think the Bible is dishonored by being referred to for judgment in small matters. The very divinity of the Book seems to me, on the contrary, to justify us in referring every thing to it, with respect to which any conclusion can be gathered from its pages. Assuming then that the Bible is neither superannuated now, nor ever likely to be so, it will follow that the illustrations which the Bible employs are likely to be clear and intelligible illustrations to the end of time. I do not mean that everything spoken of in the Bible histories must continue to endure for all time, but that the things which the Bible uses for illustration of eternal truths are likely to remain eternally intelligible illustrations. Now, I find that iron architecture is indeed spoken of in the Bible. You know how it is said to Jeremiah, [...] "Behold, I have made thee this day a defensed city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls, against the whole land." [...] But I do not find that iron building is ever alluded to as likely to become familiar to the minds of men; but, on the contrary, that an architecture of carved stone is continually employed as a source of the most important illustrations. A simple instance must occur to all of you at once. The force of the image of the Corner Stone, as used throughout Scripture, would completely be lost, if the Christian and civilized world were ever extensively to employ any other material than earth and rock in their domestic buildings: I firmly believe that they never will; but that as the laws of beauty are more perfectly established, we shall be content still to build as our forefathers built, and still to receive the same great lessons which such building is calculated to convey; of which one is indeed never to be forgotten. Among the questions respecting towers which were laid before you to-night, one has been omitted: [...] "What man is there of you intending to build a tower, that sitteth not down first and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?" [...] I have pressed upon you, this evening, the building of domestic towers. You may think it right to dismiss the subject at once from your thoughts; but let us not do so, without considering, each of us, how far that tower has been built, and how truly its cost has been counted.|$|E
