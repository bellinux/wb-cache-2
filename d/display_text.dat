5|$|Video {{output is}} through an RF {{modulator}} and {{was designed for}} use with contemporary television sets, for a simple colour graphic <b>display.</b> <b>Text</b> can be displayed using 32columns × 24rows of characters from the ZX Spectrum character set or from a set provided within an application, from a palette of 15 shades: seven colours at two levels of brightness each, plus black. The image resolution is 256×192 with the same colour limitations. To conserve memory, colour is stored separate from the pixel bitmap in a low resolution, 32×24 grid overlay, corresponding to the character cells. In practice, this means that all pixels of an 8x8 character block share one foreground colour and one background colour.|$|E

25|$|In 1993, Apple's Human Interface Group {{designed}} the typeface Espy Sans specifically for on-screen use. It {{was first used}} for the Newton OS GUI. The Newton used the font Apple Casual to <b>display</b> <b>text</b> entered using the Rosetta handwriting recognition engine in the Newton. The same font {{found its way into}} the Rosetta-derived writing recognition system in Mac OS X—Inkwell. The TrueType font can be made available to any application by copying the font file, which is embedded in a system component, to any font folder. (See List of fonts in Mac OS X for more information.) The Newton logo featured the Gill Sans typeface, which was also used for the Newton keyboard.|$|E
500|$|The English {{translation}} for Secret of Mana {{was completed}} in only 30 days, mere weeks after the Japanese release, and the North American localization was initially advertised as Final Fantasy Adventure 2. Critics {{have suggested that the}} translation was done hastily so that the game could be released in North America for the 1993 holiday season. According to translator Ted Woolsey, {{a large portion of the}} game's script was cut out in the English localization due to space limitations. To <b>display</b> <b>text</b> on the main gameplay screen, the English translation uses a fixed-width font, which limits the amount of space available to <b>display</b> <b>text.</b> Woolsey was unhappy that he had to trim conversations to their bare essentials and that he had so little time for translation, commenting that it [...] "nearly killed me". The script was difficult to translate as it was presented to Woolsey in disordered groups of text, like [...] "shuffling a novel". Other localizations were done in German and French. The Japanese release only named the three protagonists in the manual, while Western versions omitted the characters' names until the enhanced port on the iOS.|$|E
500|$|Broady complimented the graphics, writing, [...] "Drowned God {{is loaded}} with freaky {{animations}} and unexpected visual twists". Ramsey praised the visuals and the audio, saying both contributed to the game's [...] "shadowy and secretive feelings". His one significant criticism was that dialogue was difficult to hear, with no option to <b>display</b> <b>text</b> for it. Regarding the game's audio aspect, Broady said, [...] "The soundtrack is less impressive, primarily because of overuse: The background effects drone on mercilessly, {{and many of the}} game's narratives (which are universally well-written and finely acted) must be listened to over and over again." ...|$|E

500|$|The Most Hated Family in America is a 2007 BBC {{documentary}} film written and presented by Louis Theroux {{about the family}} {{at the core of}} the Westboro Baptist Church. The organization was led by Fred Phelps (who has since died) and located in Topeka, Kansas. Westboro Baptist Church members believe that the United States government is immoral due to its tolerance of homosexuality; in addition, they protest at funerals of U.S. military killed in action with signs that <b>display</b> <b>text</b> such as [...] "God Hates Fags" [...] and [...] "Thank God for Dead Soldiers". With a BBC film crew, Theroux travelled to Kansas to spend time with members of the church and interview its leadership. In the documentary, church members are shown protesting at funerals of U.S. soldiers. Theroux interviews church leadership including Fred Phelps and Shirley Phelps-Roper.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} graphics {{were created}} {{with a special}} graphics machine ("Character Generator Computer Aided Design") that generated a collection of all the graphical shapes used in the game. Shapes in the collection were assigned numbers that the game's code uses to access, and are combined to form complete images on the screen in real time. The Super Mario Bros. 3 cartridge uses Nintendo's custom MMC3 (memory management controller) ASIC to enhance the NES capabilities. [...] The MMC3 chip allows for animated tiles, extra RAM for diagonal scrolling, and a scan line timer to split the screen. The game uses these functions to split the game screen into two portions, a playfield {{on the top and}} a status bar on the bottom, allowing the top portion to scroll as the character navigates the stage while the bottom portion remains static to <b>display</b> <b>text</b> and other information.|$|E
500|$|With {{the help}} from system {{developers}} at QZ, the three {{set up their}} game – at the time just titled Stuga ("Cottage") – on Oden in 1978, and created the message board Thorvalds stugråd ("Thorvald's cottage council") for it; scientists working at QZ played the game, {{and were able to}} discuss it on the message board. The developers participated in the discussions, and used the message board to find information about bugs in the game. The Eriksson brothers and Johansson used a single Texas Silent Writer computer terminal in the Erikssons' parents' bedroom to program the game, through which they could log into Oden. Connecting to Oden was expensive, so they sometimes visited KTH during the evening to work on the game, as Oden only cost money to use during the day. At KTH, they had access to one terminal each, which used actual monitors to <b>display</b> <b>text,</b> as opposed to their writer terminal at home which printed the text on [...] "enormous amounts of paper".|$|E

2500|$|Ligatures {{have grown}} in {{popularity}} over the last 20 years due to an increasing interest in creating typesetting systems that evoke arcane designs and classical scripts. One of the first computer typesetting programs {{to take advantage of}} computer-driven typesetting (and later laser printers) was Donald Knuth's TeX program. Now the standard method of mathematical typesetting, its default fonts are explicitly based on nineteenth-century styles. Many new fonts feature extensive ligature sets; these include FF Scala, Seria and others by Martin Majoor and Hoefler Text by Jonathan Hoefler. Mrs Eaves by Zuzana Licko contains a particularly large set to allow designers to create dramatic <b>display</b> <b>text</b> with a feel of antiquity.|$|E
