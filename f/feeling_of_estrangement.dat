5000|$|Somnath Bhattacharya further elaborates on {{the views}} related to {{transvestite}} and transsexuality traits of Ramakrishna. Bhattacharyya argues that dressing up in feminine attire {{as part of}} a legitimate and culturally accepted sadhana {{for a short period of}} time does not amount to transvestism, since Ramakrishna also dressed like a Shakta and a Vaishnava during his Shakti and Vaishnava sadhana days, and like a Muslim during his Islam sadhana, which was in male attire. Bhattacharya argues that Ramakrishna's dressing habits were in line with this religious practice. Bhattacharya also argues that Ramakrishna cannot be described as a secondary transsexual. He quotes Ramakrishna's words. [...] "Formerly I too used to see many visions, but now in my ecstatic state I don't see so many. I am gradually getting over my feminine nature; I feel nowadays more like a man. Therefore I control my emotions; I don't manifest it outwardly so much. ..." [...] Bhattacharya writes that the American Psychiatric Association defines transsexuality as a strong and persistent cross-gender identification, and not merely a desire for any perceived cultural advantages of being the other sex; it is a disorder always involving distress to the person, with a <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>estrangement</b> from the body and a felt need to alter the appearance of the body.|$|E

40|$|Gay and {{bisexual}} (GB) male adolescents are {{at increased risk}} for engaging in suicidal behaviors, when compared to their heterosexual counterparts. Traditional models of the coming out process suggested that GB male youths are vulnerable to negative mental health outcomes (e. g., suicidality) due to their <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>estrangement</b> from same-sex peers and the lack of media representation of GB men (Troiden, 1979; Cass, 1984). However, GB male representations in the media have increased significantly. This review of the literature suggests that this increased representation of GB men may be related to a decision for many GB male adolescents to disclose their sexual orientations at younger ages than previous generations. This may, in turn, contribute to an increase in GB adolescent suicide risk, as early disclosure of sexual orientation is a significant risk factor for suicidal behaviors.

However, they have failed to address the literary implication of Cusk’s appropriation of memoir writing, which, because it is defined by something which is impossible – at attempt at capturing the reality of an experience which is idealised, imaged and partly beyond words – gives way to creative solutions that undermine preconceived ideas about both the feelings motherhood should engender and the form any account of that experience should take.

Even though the habit of writing letters has diminished compared to the times before the phone, fax and e-mail, in some circumstances letter writing is still common. Long distances, lack of money, and homesickness - experiences that most foreign exchange students encounter - are surely factors that accelerate one's desire to write letters.

Today, self-reflection is somewhat in fashion in ethnological research (Gerholm 1993; Wikdahl 1992 : 17). Therefore, I dared to carry out an experiment myself. This paper is based on letters and diaries I wrote before I knew I would be an ethnologist Yet this is primarily a methodological experiment with the aim of comparing two different types of source material that have been produced by one person using the evaluation of sources point of view.

Every individual has different kinds of experiences that constructs one's world-view about the inter-subjective world. One of the experiences that I have chosen to analyze is the experience of violence. I will approach the problem of violence through phenomenology. I have taken Michael Staudigl's two articles, Towards a Phenomenological Theory of Violence: Reflections Following Merleau- Ponty and Schutz and The Many Faces of Violence: A Phenomenological Inquiry, as background for my phenomenological understanding of violence. Violence {{so far has been}} understood by different disciplines of social sciences as an abstract concept where the analyst has to be an objective observer, whereas violence should be looked at as an act of intentionality by the perpetrator of violence. How does the experience of violence destruct the “sense structures” of the consciousness of an individual and bring the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>estrangement</b> with the lived-world and within oneself?

Research projects (such as the ‘Debomy Report’ and the Eurobarometer) highlight a negative, or at least a non-positive, perception of the European Union by citizens of member states. This negative view has recently been strengthened by the nomination of political personalities of inadequate standing as President of the Union, as High Commissioner for Foreign Policy and as members of the Commission. The negative representations of the European Union are the starting point {{in the construction of the}} future scenarios of Europe put forward by the author. Imagining four strategic moves (one constructed on the perception of European peoples; two on hypothesis set forth by scholars; another one – Turkey’s request of adhesion to the EU – already present in Europe’s agenda), the author analyzes the possible consequences for Europe and for its role in a globalized world. The first move is the exit of the UK from the Union and its adhesion to the United States; the second is the adhesion of Russia to the European Union; the third the adhesion of Turkey; the forth the adhesion of Maghrebian countries to the Union. Each move determines new scenarios for Europe as well as for the global context. According to the author, imagining such scenarios is a useful way of reasoning on the future role of Europe and try to recover the true meaning of the European project, as imagined by its founding fathers, thus reacting against the neo-nationalistic insurgence which is taking Europe towards its own catastrophe...|$|E
40|$|Alien hand {{syndrome}} (AHS) is {{a neurological}} illness characterized by limb movements which {{are carried out}} without being aware of it. Many patients describe these movements as aggressive and some perceive a strong <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>estrangement</b> and {{go so far as}} to deny ownership. The sense of body ownership is the perception that parts of one’s body pertain to oneself, despite it is moving or not and if movement is intentional or unintentional. These anomalous self-experiences may arise in patients with focal brain lesions and provide unique opportunities to disclose the neural components underlying self-body perception. The feeling of foreignness described in AHS is often observed in post-central cortical lesions in the non-dominant hemisphere and is typical of the “posterior alien hand variant”. We used Diffusion-Tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) in an unusual case of posterior AHS of the dominant hand in a professional pianist with corticobasal syndrome (CBS). The patient showed uncontrolled levitation with the right arm while playing the piano and perceived as if her hand had a “mind of its own” which prevented her from playing. MRI-scans show asymmetric brain atrophy, mainly involving left post-central regions and SPECT-Tc 99 m-ECD patterns of hypometabolism over the left parietal-occipital cortices. DT-MRI revealed extensive damage which comprised left fronto-temporal cortex and extends into the ipsilateral parietal cortex causing a disruption of corpus callosum (CC) projections from the rostrum to the splenium. Our case illustrates that posterior AHS may occur in the dominant hemisphere due to widespread damage, which exceed parietal cortex. The parietal lobe has been recognized as a multimodal association region that gets input from several networks and organizes motor output. We suggest that the disturbance to this pathway could result in disruption of motor output and associate an abnormal motor control and anomalous self-body perception...|$|E

40|$|Xenomelia is {{the oppressive}} feeling {{that one or}} more limbs of one's body {{do not belong to}} one's self. We present the results of a {{thorough}} examination of the characteristics of the disorder in 15 males with a strong desire for amputation of one or both legs. The <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>estrangement</b> had been present since early childhood and was limited to a precisely demarcated part of the leg in all individuals. Neurological status examination and neuropsychological testing were normal in all participants, and psychiatric evaluation ruled out the presence of a psychotic disorder. In 13 individuals and in 13 pair-matched control participants, magnetic resonance imaging was performed, and surface-based morphometry revealed significant group differences in cortical architecture. In the right hemisphere, participants with xenomelia showed reduced cortical thickness in the superior parietal lobule and reduced cortical surface area in the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, in the inferior parietal lobule, {{as well as in the}} anterior insular cortex. A cluster of increased thickness was located in the central sulcus. In the left hemisphere, affected individuals evinced a larger cortical surface area in the inferior parietal lobule and secondary somatosensory cortex. Although of modest size, these structural correlates of xenomelia appear meaningful when discussed against the background of some key clinical features of the disorder. Thus, the predominantly right-sided cortical abnormalities are in line with a strong bias for left-sided limbs as the target of the amputation desire, evident both in our sample and in previously described populations with xenomelia. We also propose that the higher incidence of lower compared with upper limbs (∼ 80 % according to previous investigations) may explain the erotic connotations typically associated with xenomelia, also in the present sample. These may have their roots in the proximity of primary somatosensory cortex for leg representation, whose surface area was reduced in the participants with xenomelia, with that of the genitals. Alternatively, the spatial adjacency of secondary somatosensory cortex for leg representation and the anterior insula, the latter known to mediate sexual arousal beyond that induced by direct tactile stimulation of the genital area, might play a role. Although the right hemisphere regions of significant neuroarchitectural correlates of xenomelia are part of a network reportedly subserving body ownership, it remains unclear whether the structural alterations are the cause or rather the consequence of the long-standing and pervasive mismatch between body and sel...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{account for more}} {{attention}} to computer games as a cultural phenomenon that can be taught about. Due to the overemphasis on computer games as either causes of aggression and addiction, or the new means to educate our curriculum content, an elaborated concept of computer game literacy education, i. e. teaching about computer games, has not been developed yet. Media education, to which {{the idea of the}} ‘constructedness’ of all media is central, can serve as a framework for teaching about computer games. Its two pillars of critical reflection and personal media production can apply to computer game literacy education. However, since computer games are, next to media - with their own medium specificities - also ludic configurations, the theory needs to be adjusted. From the infant theory on computer game literacy education it becomes clear that the twofold nature of computer games as both representational media and rule-based systems {{is at the core of}} computer game literacy education. Furthermore, attention to the increased responsibility of players, as a result of the interactive nature of computer games, plays an important part. Both the small field of computer game literacy education and the broader field of new media literacies mostly stress the production part, while critical reflection receives less attention. For that reason, I argue for a particular kind of computer game that could teach critical reflection by commenting on its own built-in assumptions. I therefore look into the so-called epic theater of German theater practitioner and theorist Bertolt Brecht. He tried to accomplish a critical attitude to his audience by emphasizing the artificiality of his plays, rather than to present the depicted world as natural and unalterable. In order to bring about a critical distance, he employed so-called alienation effects, which were to accomplish a <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>estrangement.</b> Since both theater and computer games are representations of actions, and thereby have the ability to simulate, a translation from one domain to the other proves fruitful. Two of Brecht’s alienation effects, the break of the fourth wall and the separation of the elements, are particularly suitable for a translation to computer games. I provide several examples of how these elements manifest themselves in computer games, elaborating on the effects these epic elements can bring about and how they can serve computer game literacy education...|$|E
40|$|Introduction {{grotesque}} " Real {{and apparent}} contradictions abound {{in discussions of}} the grotesque; it is an extremely flexible category ", as Geoffrey Galt Harpham reminds us (Harpham article 464). Whoever reads into the bulk of criticism attached to the grotesque will see instability as the first striking characteristic of a concept that Baudelaire called " this indefinable element of beauty […] that obscure and mysterious element " (Baudelaire 132). The purpose of this brief introduction is not to provide an exhaustive survey of the many nuances found in the exegesis of the grotesque, which would necessitate to foray deep into historical, architectural, aesthetic and literary approaches, but to sketch in the theories deemed essential to a correct assessment of the prominence and meaning of the grotesque in the European fiction of the 19 th century. The works of 20 th-century literary critics like Kayser, Bakhtin and Harpham (taken together perhaps) provide a reasonably clear insight into the fundamentally ambivalent concept. The grotesque was theorized in the 19 th century notably by Hugo, Ruskin and Baudelaire, who {{shed light on the}} significance of grotesque within Romanticism and Victorian realism. The grotesque famously borrows its name from the accident of the discovery around 1480 of the remains of Nero's Domus Aurea and its elaborate ornaments. Its meaning then gradually expanded from the designation of the decorative grotesque of the Renaissance to what may appear as a vague or all-inclusive category. Critics generally agree, however, on the central idea that the grotesque realizes the either harmonious or hair-raising, but always impossible, fusion of heterogeneous elements. The word has come more prosaically to designate an unexpected mixture of comic and horror or of comic and disgust. Laughter is central-distortion, even carried out to extremities, is not grotesque without laughter. " For an object to be grotesque, it must arouse three responses. Laughter and astonishment are two; either disgust or horror is the third " (Harpham article 463). Harpham's 1976 definition puts to the fore the essential idea that the grotesque originates in the subject of the gaze, that it isn't inherent in the grotesque object. This, Baudelaire had underlined as early as 1855 : " Indian and Chinese idols are unaware that they are ridiculous; it is in us, Christians, that their comicality resides. " (Baudelaire 142). And to grasp the impact of the viewer's <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>estrangement,</b> his (at least initial) impossibility {{to make sense of the}} grotesque image, one must also remember that the grotesque emerges in a realistic context: " [The grotesque] threat depends for its effectiveness on the efficacy of the everyday, the partial fulfilment of our usual expectations. We must be believers whose faith has been profoundly shaken but not destroyed; otherwise we lose that fear of life and become resigned to absurdity, fantasy, or death " (Harpham 462).

The Faculty of Discernment {{is a collection of}} feminist travel vignettes compiled according to the suggestion that a woman who travels, in spite of its dangers, is a revolutionary. The work chronicles routine life in each city it features, introducing a local character who meets her network, her culture, and social norms with an analytical eye, employing the faculty of discernment. The collection is sectioned into seven major divisions separated by interludes. “Naogaon” identifies the narrator as living in the United States and struggling with the pressures in a “broken” household and isolation.

40|$|South Africa’s Department of Human Settlements {{has sought}} to rectify apartheid-era injustices through the mass {{construction}} of low-income housing. Housing allocation efforts {{have led to the}} demolition of informal settlements and relocation of low-income residents to new developments. The drive to eliminate informal settlements rests within a global call to achieve “slum”-free cities. Many residents in South Africa come from informal settlements, where they have developed networks of trust, participation, and livelihoods. A concern with relocation efforts is that new housing developments disrupt pre-existing sense of community, which refers to an individual’s <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> belonging to a group with a shared connection and attachment to place. My dissertation investigates the influence of different housing approaches on residents’ sense of community, as indicated in social trust, community participation, and place attachment. This dissertation asks: How do different approaches to housing low-income residents influence sense of community? In order to answer this research question, I conducted field work in four sites: Cosmo City (a state-driven private developer project in Johannesburg); Diepsloot (a vast informal settlement in Johannesburg); Freedom Park (a self-help community in western Cape Town); Springfield Terrace (medium density apartments near the Cape Town CBD). With the support of a research team, I took a mixed-method approach through several data collection activities: 190 door-to-door surveys, 82 semi-structured resident interviews, 11 community mapping focus group sessions, and 15 semi-structured interviews with community leaders and non-governmental organizations. During my research, I discovered that arriving to new housing resulted in feeling uprooted for some residents who no longer lived near their former neighbors. Smaller scale housing developments, located close to the city center, and on land that has historical meaning for residents mitigate <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>estrangement.</b> The limited capacity to form neighborhood watch or street cleanup groups stems from lack of will or ability, infrastructure, funding, and training. Residents are more likely to report attachment to place if they demonstrate <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> belonging, safety, pride, and plans to stay in their housing in the future.

As {{a student of}} Composition, I will start by reminding the reader {{that one of the}} most problematic situations that composers of today face is not strictly related to music itself. Instead, it has to do with the relationship between them and the general public. Unlike other times of the last five centuries, we live in a time when a large gap exists between the music written today and the taste of the general public. Because of this, is not unusual nowadays to see small audiences enjoying performances of new works. The taste of the public is still very attached to the musical expression of the nineteenth century, and pieces that have been written eighty years ago are announced and performed by the most important orchestras almost as new pieces. This situation is unique in music history. For that reason, it became the starting point for the concept of the current project. The best way I have found to contribute to solving the above-mentioned problem is by writing original music in a contemporary language, and then making a measured use of fragments from a different music, something from the past, which appears throughout the piece in the way of flashbacks. The fragments chosen for this task (which, by the way, have not suffered important alterations or developments) are part of the String Quartet in G minor, Op. 10, by Claude Debussy. The reasons for choosing this composer and not another are based on my belief that Debussy was the first true twentieth-century composer, particularly for the way he thought about music (besides the innovations that are easily recognizable as his). However, I am conscious that Debussy is another composer considered as almost contemporary by many people, thus ignoring in some way the hundred years of musical evolution that separate his music from the contemporary. During the piece, the listener will be exposed to two different musical worlds. One of these, which belongs to the past, will be felt as a well known territory, a place where he feels secure. However, most of the time he will be immersed in a different music, where the employed language is very different and so is its construction. The listener may experience there a <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>estrangement.</b> The original music I wrote has undeniable roots in Debussy's music, however, the conceptual objective of the piece is to push the listener, whose experience has probably kept him apart from contemporary languages, to wonder about the obvious distance in evolution that exists between the different kinds of music used in the piece. The medium chosen for the piece is not arbitrary since the string quartet may be the most traditional ensemble in chamber music and for that, it seems to be a good tool to show the evolution of music. In order to explain in a clearer way the main idea that governs the piece, I would like to situate the reader in an imaginary place, maybe a room, where some action is taking place. Let us call that imaginary space A. At the same time, we have next to A another imaginary space, another room, with characteristics different from the first, which we will call B. Finally, I would like the reader to imagine himself opening the door that connects the two rooms in order to see just for an instant the action of the other room. It is important to recall here that the more different the action of A and B are, the longer the subject will need to observe in order to get a clear picture of the foreign action.

40|$|A {{triangulated}} {{design was}} used to investigate the influences of remaining unmarried on Palestinian women’s self-perception and mental health status. Three-hundred, never-married {{women between the ages}} of 25 and 50 years were selected using a convenience sampling technique. All these unmarried respondents filled in the Derogatis SCL. 90 -R (a self report measure of mental health symptomatology) by themselves. One hundred and sixty three participants of the 300 were successfully interviewed by means of a face-to-face, semi-structured, tape-recorded interviews with 15 open-ended questions. The SCL- 90 -R was analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 10, guided by Derogatis’s (1983) booklet guide. The 163 interviews were transcribed verbatim, typed on Microsoft Word and analyzed qualitatively using thematic and content analyses according to the guidelines of the phenomenological method. Descriptive statistics, Kruskall-Wallis Tests, Spearman Correlation Coefficients, and multiple regressions were uses to analyze the Derogatis SCL. 90 -R. A comparison of the major findings of the current study with the findings of relevant previous national and international research was presented. Analyses of the SCL- 90 -R indicated that unmarried Palestinian women in the current study have more psychological problems as represented through the 3 indices and 9 symptom dimensions of the SCL- 90 -R, than do Palestinian women in general, and more than the female normative group studied by Derogatis (1983). The findings indicated that about one-third of the respondents complained of moderate and above rates of psychological distress on the SCL- 90 -R’s ‘global severity index’ and the eight of the nine symptom dimensions. Being highly educated and being in employment were associated with better mental health among the unmarried respondents in the current study. The lower the educational level of the unmarried woman, the more emotional and psychological complaints she is likely to have. Unemployed and poorly educated participants were likely to have more psychological problems than employed and highly educated women. Other independent variables were significant under some circumstances, including family composition, place of living and the age of the participants. The analysis of the interviews indicated that there were multiple reasons for remaining single in the Palestinian society that included sociocultural, psychological, financial, familial, and personal factors. On the other hand, most of the respondents approved that marriage is better than singlehood despite its difficulties and excessive responsibilities. The majority of the respondents were harassed, restricted in living and movement, were censured by their families and society in general, which augmented their <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>estrangement</b> and alienation in their society. The respondents of the current study varied in their feelings and self-perception as a reaction to remaining unmarried. Some were proud, satisfied, and assertive about themselves, while the others had feelings of sadness, inferiority, worry, over-sensitivity, loneliness, insecurity, pessimism or uncertainty about their future and their families. Somatization, withdrawal, vi interpersonal difficulties, aggression, and escape mechanisms were common reactions and behaviours that were reported by the respondents. However, the feelings and reactions of the unmarried women to remaining unmarried were related to the manner in which they were treated by society and their families, and their own attitudes about remaining single. In terms of how they compared themselves to other women, there were no consistent findings as some respondents believed they were more fortunate or less fortunate than other women in their communities. Being educated, employed, independent, assertive and getting one’s family’s support and understanding had positive influence on the self-perception of the respondents in the current study. Despite the negative feelings that were reported by many respondents, very few had ever consulted a mental health professional or sought counseling. Special consideration should be given to the emotional needs and psychological problems of unmarried Palestinian women. This is a challenging area for mental health professionals and family health care providers. Implications were discussed in relation to mental health practice, social systems and social organizations, and further research with emphasis on gender in health care was recommended. This was the first study in Palestinian society that explored self- perception and the mental health state of the unmarried women. In addition, the present study could be the first study of its kind in Arab countries as far as the literature shows, which investigated "remaining unmarried after age 25 " among women and focused on the state of their mental health.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThis {{case study}} aims {{to explore the}} experiential world {{of gays and lesbians}} who keep their sexual {{orientation}} secret from colleagues and superiors in the workplace. The study also considers the impact of the transition to constitutional equality for gays and lesbians in South Africa on the participants' occupational lives. Qualitative data were acquired from two sets of in-depth semi-structured interviews, conducted with four subjects in 1994 and again with the same subjects in 1996. Themes derived through phenomenological analysis are considered in the light of existential-analytic psychological theory. The exploration reveals that, within patriarchal work environments that remain homoprejudiced despite the constitutional provision for gay and lesbian equality, openness about sexual orientation requires considerable courage. Findings suggest that in these environments, gays and lesbians may be classified as dirty, diseased others. Through discriminatory acts of distortion, patriarchy attempts to dominate such others, and, with ultimate contempt, even to deny their existence. Gays and lesbians internalise general societal prejudice and discrimination against them. In their response to homoprejudice in the workplace. participants employed elaborate measures to safeguard themselves and pass as heterosexual. Their passing elicited guilt feelings, an implicit recognition of inauthenticity. and other indicators of neurosis, such as increased loneliness, isolation and <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>estrangement.</b> These manifestations were the consequence of participants' distortive attempts to create security where none could be guaranteed because of the contingent nature of human existence. To the extent that their concealment failed to bring security and reduce neurotic anxjety, it could be considered a flight from freedom. Passing left participants feeling invisible and inaudible, so that they existed as counterfeit images of themselves in inauthentic relationships with their colleagues. In this way, gays and lesbians as a group already isolated contribute to their own marginalisation. Nevertheless. constitutional guarantees in some cases increased <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> power and security in that legal recourse had become possible in the event of intolerable, blatant discrimination. It is clear that the victory of constitutional equality was merely the beginning of a long struggle towards achieving this equality in practice. The recognition of equality grants gays and lesbians freedom, but also implies responsibility to advance courageously. The opportunities offered by the Constitution therefore represent a call to authenticity...|$|R
