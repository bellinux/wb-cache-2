5|$|Discrimination against Jews was {{condemned}} by many high-profile figures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> country.

5|$|By 1944, the SS-TV {{had been}} {{organized}} into three divisions: {{staff of the}} concentration camps in Germany and Austria, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territories, and of the extermination camps in Poland. By 1944, it became standard practice to rotate SS members {{in and out of}} the camps, partly based on manpower needs, but also to provide easier assignments to wounded Waffen-SS members. This rotation of personnel meant that nearly the entire SS knew what was going on inside the concentration camps, making the entire organization liable for war crimes and crimes against humanity.|$|E
5|$|In March 1944, when Hungary {{realised}} {{that it was}} on {{the losing}} side in the war and began to negotiate with the Allies, Germany took control of the country, including the annexed territories, during Operation Margarethe I. This was followed by the collection and transport of the remaining Jews <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territories to extermination camps, resulting in the deaths of 85 per cent of the Jews <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territories. Prior to their withdrawal from the Balkans {{in the face of the}} advance of the Soviet Red Army, the Germans evacuated 60,000–70,000 Volksdeutsche from Bačka and Baranja to Austria. Bačka and Baranja were restored to Yugoslav control when the Germans were pushed out of the region by the Red Army in late 1944. Međimurje and Prekmurje remained occupied until the last weeks of the war.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, the Hungarian {{authorities}} began evacuating the Székelys settled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territories since 1941 to Transdanubia. Several {{days after}} the Soviet Red Army entered the Banat on 1 October 1944, the Germans began the evacuation of Bačka, including the local Volksdeutsche. With the advance of the Partisans and the Red Army, some of the Volksdeutsche left the region while some others stayed, despite the situation.|$|E

5|$|In a third {{trial in}} early 1946, the National Court of Hungary in Budapest found Szombathelyi, Feketehalmy-Czeydner, Grassy, Deák, and Zöldi guilty of {{involvement}} in the massacres <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territories, and in carrying out the deportation of Jews to extermination camps. In accordance with the provisions of Article 14 of the Armistice Agreement, the Hungarian authorities then extradited them to Yugoslavia, where they underwent a fourth trial in Novi Sad in October 1946. They were all sentenced to death and executed the following month.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the occupation troops directly commanded by Schröder, in June the Wehrmacht deployed {{the headquarters of the}} LXV Corps zbV to Belgrade to command four poorly-equipped occupation divisions, under the control of General der Artillerie Paul Bader. Three divisions were deployed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territory, and the fourth was deployed in the adjacent parts of the NDH. The three divisions had been transported to the occupied territory between 7 and 24 May, and were initially tasked with guarding the key railway lines to Bulgaria and Greece. By late June, Bader's headquarters had been established in Belgrade, and the three divisions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territory were deployed with headquarters at Valjevo in the west, Topola roughly in the centre of the territory, and Niš in the south. The status of Bader's command was that Schröder could order him to undertake operations against rebels, but he could not otherwise act as Bader's superior.|$|E
5|$|Soviet {{civilian}} populations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> {{areas were}} severely persecuted and endured the treacherous {{conditions of the}} Eastern Front, which spawned atrocities such as the siege of Leningrad (when more than 1.2 million civilians died). Thousands of peasant villages across Russia, Belarus and Ukraine were annihilated by German troops. During the occupation the Leningrad, Pskov and Novgorod region lost {{about a quarter of}} its population. An estimated one-quarter of Soviet civilian deaths {{at the hands of the}} Nazis and their allies (five million Russians, three million Ukrainians and 1.5 million Belarusians) were racially motivated. In 1995 the Russian Academy of Sciences reported that civilian deaths <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> USSR, including Jews, at the hands of the Germans totaled 13.7 million dead (20 percent of the population of 68 million). The figure includes 7.4 million victims of Nazi genocide and reprisals; 2.2 million deaths of persons deported to Germany as forced labour, and 4.1 million famine and disease deaths. An estimated three million people also died of starvation in unoccupied territory. The losses occurred within the 1946–1991 borders of the USSR, and include territories annexed in 1939–40. The deaths of 8.2 million Soviet civilians, including Jews, were documented by the Soviet Extraordinary State Commission.|$|E

5|$|Such was {{the extent}} of the Holocaust <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territories {{that by the end of}} the war, nearly 85 per cent of the Jews that had been living in the Hungarian-occupied Yugoslav territories in April 1941 had been killed. This figure {{comprised}} about 13,500 Jews from Bačka and Baranja, and about 1,300 from Međimurje and Prekmurje.|$|E
5|$|The {{flag was}} {{a tool of}} Japanese imperialism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> Southeast Asian areas during Second World War: people {{had to use the}} flag, and {{schoolchildren}} sang Kimigayo in morning flag raising ceremonies. Local flags were allowed for some areas such as the Philippines, Indonesia, and Manchukuo. In Korea which was part of the Empire of Japan, the Hinomaru and other symbols were used to declare that the Koreans were subjects of the empire.|$|E

5|$|After Germany {{occupied}} Hungary in March 1944, the genocidal {{policies of}} the authorities were applied comprehensively. Hungarian Jews were subjected to starvation and death marches, and those that had remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territories were transported to extermination camps. From 26 April 1944, the remaining Jews in Bačka and Baranja, mostly women, but including children and the elderly, were rounded up into local concentration camps then moved to larger camps in Hungary proper. Between 14,000 and 15,000 Jews from Bačka, Baranja {{and other parts of}} Hungary were collected at Baja and Bácsalmás then transported to Auschwitz where most were killed. In September 1944, the workforce of the Bor mine was force-marched for several weeks back to extermination camps where the survivors were killed. One of the two groups of workers numbered 2,500, but only a few survived.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as he}} took office, Meyszner {{embarked}} on a thorough re-organisation of all police operations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territory. He created four police area commands, aligned to the four military area commands, and ten police districts, corresponding to the military district commands. He took under his command {{the forces of the}} Serbian puppet government, known as the Serbian State Guard, and also established a number of auxiliary and volunteer police units across the whole territory. One of the units controlled by Meyszner was the Auxiliary Police Troop, recruited from Russian Volksdeutsche from the occupied territory but also from Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece and Romania and trained by the Orpo. It was planned to reach a strength of 400 men but little is known about its activities.|$|E
5|$|For {{the rest}} of the war, Leopold was held under house-arrest in the Palace of Laeken. In 1941, while still incarcerated, he married Mary Lilian Baels, {{undermining}} his popularity with the Belgian public which disliked Baels and considered the marriage to discredit his claim to martyr status. Despite his position, he remained prominent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> territory, and coins and stamps continued to carry his portrait or monogramme. While imprisoned, he sent a letter to Hitler in 1942 credited with saving an estimated 500,000 Belgian women and children from forced deportation to munitions factories in Germany. In January 1944, Leopold was moved to Germany where he remained for {{the rest of}} the war.|$|E

5|$|From about 700 BCE iron working reached north Britain. There is {{evidence}} for about 1,000 Iron Age hillforts in Scotland, most located below the Clyde-Forth line. The majority are circular, {{with a single}} palisade around an enclosure. They {{appear to have been}} largely abandoned in the Roman period, both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> region and further north in the regions beyond Roman control. This may have been because of the threat posed by Roman incursions, which meant that concentrations of military and political force were vulnerable to incursions and siege. Archaeological evidence indicates that some were reoccupied after their departure.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Himmler {{consolidated}} all of {{the offices}} for which Pohl was responsible into one, creating the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office (Wirtschafts- und Verwaltungshauptamt; WVHA). The entire concentration camp system was placed {{under the authority of}} the WVHA. The SS owned Sudetenquell GbmH, a mineral water producer in Sudetenland. By 1944, the SS had purchased 75 percent of the mineral water producers in Germany and were intending to acquire a monopoly. Several concentration camps produced building materials such as stone, bricks, and cement for the SS-owned Deutsche Erd- und Steinwerke (German Earth And Stone Works; DEST). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> Eastern territories, the SS acquired a monopoly in brick production by seizing all 300 extant brickworks. The DWB also founded the Ost-Deutsche Baustoffwerke (East German Building Supply Works; GmbH or ODBS) and Deutsche Edelmöbel GmbH (German Noble Furniture). These operated in factories the SS had confiscated from Jews and Poles.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942, Berger was {{appointed}} as Himmler's liaison {{officer with the}} Reichsminister for the Occupied Eastern Territories, Alfred Rosenberg. To bolster his position with Himmler, Rosenberg was even willing to appoint Berger as his second state secretary, but Hitler would not allow it. On 10 August 1943, Berger convinced Rosenberg to appoint him as the Chief of Political Operations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Occupied</b> Eastern Territories. Himmler had long wanted such responsibilities {{to be placed in}} SS hands, and this appointment meant that Berger could sabotage any resistance to SS domination of the economy and population of the subjugated east. The appointment took effect on 10 August 1943, and lasted until January 1945. In this role, Berger proposed a plan to kidnap and enslave 50,000 Eastern European {{children between the ages of}} 10 and 14, under the codename Heuaktion. On 14 June 1944, Rosenberg issued orders implementing Berger's idea.|$|E
