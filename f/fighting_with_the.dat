5|$|After the war, the American and Philippines governments officially {{recognized}} some of {{the units}} and individuals who had fought against the Japanese, which led to benefits for the veterans but not all claims were upheld. There were 277 recognized guerrilla units out of over a thousand claimed and 260,715 individuals were recognized from nearly 1.3 million claims. These beneficiaries are only available to the guerrillas and veterans who have served for the Commonwealth, and doesn't include the brigand groups of the Huks and the Moros.

5|$|Battle Hill was {{the site}} of {{especially}} brutal <b>fighting,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Americans inflicting the highest number of casualties against the British troops during the entire Battle of Long Island.

Among the American dead was Pennsylvania Colonel Caleb Parry, who was killed while rallying his troops.|$|E

They planned several large-scale operations for this purpose in which air support played a very important role.|$|E

5|$|In 986, Basil II led a {{campaign}} with 30,000 soldiers. The commanders {{of the eastern}} armies did not {{take part in the}} campaign because they were <b>fighting</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Arabs. The Byzantines marched from Odrin via Plovdiv to reach Sredets (Sofia). According to Leo Diaconus the objective of their Emperor was to subdue the Bulgarians with one strike. After the capture of Serdica which was a strategic fortress between the northeastern and southwestern Bulgarian lands Basil II intended to continue his campaign towards Samuil's main strongholds in Macedonia.|$|E

Uniquely amongst the {{military}} leaders who had revolted against him, Basil II continued to rely on Bourtzes and entrusted him again with the critical position of doux of Antioch in 989, {{in the aftermath of}} another rebellion, this time of Bardas Phokas. In November 989, Bourtzes took the city over from Leo Phokas, the son of Bardas, who himself had submitted to the emperor only months earlier. From this position, {{over the next few years}} Bourtzes led the defence of the imperial frontier in a renewed bout of <b>fighting</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Fatimids, as the two empires disputed control over the Hamdanid emirate of Aleppo.|$|E

5|$|The 27th Regiment became {{locked in}} fierce <b>fighting</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Partisan 27th East Bosnia Division and 38th Bosnia Division, which had {{launched}} an offensive near Vlasenica.

5|$|The Allies seem to {{have formed}} into two wings; on the right were the Athenians, Corinthians, Sicyonians and Troezenians, and on the left were the Spartans with other contingents. The right wing marched across level ground {{straight}} towards the Persian camp, whilst the left wing attempted to outflank the Persians by passing through more broken ground. The right wing thus began <b>fighting</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Persians while the left wing was still approaching. Herodotus reports that the Persians fought well at first, but that the Athenians and the contingents with them wished to win the victory before the Spartans arrived, and thus attacked ever more zealously.|$|E

5|$|The Kingdom of Hungary was {{defeated}} by the Ottoman Empire in the Battle of Mohács in 1526. The Turks besieged and damaged Pressburg, but failed to conquer it. Owing to Ottoman advances into Hungarian territory, the city was designated the new capital of Hungary in 1536, {{becoming part of the}} Austrian Habsburg monarchy and marking {{the beginning of a new}} era. The city became a coronation town and the seat of kings, archbishops (1543), the nobility and all major organisations and offices. Between 1536 and 1830, eleven Hungarian kings and queens were crowned at St. Martin's Cathedral. The 17th century was marked by anti-Habsburg uprisings, <b>fighting</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Turks, floods, plagues and other disasters, which diminished the population.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} in Regina struggled to deliver {{services to the}} vast territory. The influx of settlers and responsibility for the Klondike, as well as constant <b>fighting</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> federal government over limited legislative powers and minimal revenue collection, hampered the effectiveness of government. The government during this period slowly released powers to the elected members. In 1897, after control of the executive council was ceded to elected members from the Lieutenant-Governors, a short-lived period of party politics evolved that challenged the consensus model of government {{that had been used}} since 1870.|$|E
