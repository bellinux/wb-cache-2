50|$|The Victoria & Albert Museum {{commissioned}} Collishaw with {{a monumental}} onsite project, Magic Lantern, which - {{installed in the}} cupola above the entrance - appropriated {{the architecture of the}} V&A creating a beacon of light, complete with an attendant swarm of moths, and was visible across London during the winter months of 2010 - 2011.This is not an exit, 2013 at Blain|Southern Gallery, London, saw Collishaw return to medium of oil painting. However, as is usual with his practice, nothing is literal; the primary source material - magnified images drawn from the pages of glossy magazines - is a simple metaphor, one part of a prism conceived to examine moral questions provoked by the excessive binge culture that preceded the global financial crisis. When seen from a distance, these large-scale works appear to be abstract paintings constructed on a classic modernist grid; closer inspection reveals them to be scraps of advertisements for luxury goods culled from ‘lifestyle’ magazines like Tatler and Vogue. But this is only partially the case; they are in fact facsimiles of the precisely folded, origami-like ‘wraps’ used by drug dealers to package cocaine, complete with powdery traces of the narcotic.In 2014 Collishaw held a solo exhibition at Galleria Borghese, Rome, titled Black Mirror whereby he responded to the works in the Borghese collection. Three paintings by Caravaggio (Madonna and Child with St. Anne - Dei Palafrenieri, David with the Head of Goliath, Saint Jerome Writing) appear and disappear behind the surfaces of large mirrors framed in black Murano glass. The figures are animated to appear as though posing for the painting; breathing, blinking and shifting their weight in front of us. Everyday people caught {{in the process of being}} transformed into religious icons, trapped like spectres in an indeterminate space between the real world and the realm of the painting. The Massacre of the Innocents by Ippolito Scarsella was referenced by a fourth work on the ground floor of the museum. Featuring over 300 characters, the Biblical tale of genocide is re-enacted in All things Fall, as a cornucopia of savagery comes to life in a heaving mass of kaleidoscopic brutality - forever trapped in a frenzied purgatory of interminable violence.Collishaw held a major retrospective at New Art Gallery Walsall, in 2015. The exhibition included photography, film, sculpture and installation and testified to the richness and breadth of Collishaw’s practice, highlighting and exploring some of the overriding themes and preoccupations within his work. Works from 1996 through to 2015 were presented over two floors, including his ambitious installation, Deliverance (2008), repeated projections onto walls coated in phosphorescent paint present ghostly figures that appear suddenly and then slowly fade, only to be replaced by another. Drawing on the news coverage of the 2004 Beslan siege, Collishaw makes reference to the seemingly insatiable appetite of the press for images of disaster and trauma and of the complex and often ambivalent ways in which we as viewers respond to these distressing scenes. The exhibition included works from the photographic series’ Single Nights (2007), Insecticides(2006-ongoing) and Catching Fairies (1996) as well as the sculptural series The Venal Muse (2012-15) in which brightly coloured flowers, presented in vitrines, reveal on close inspection evidence of disease and decay. New Art Gallery Walsall also staged the UK premier of Collishaw’s acclaimed zoetrope, All Things Fall.Concurrent to the exhibition at Walsall, Collishaw presented In Camera, a work commissioned by GRAIN and The Library of Birmingham, inspired by the Library’s internationally renowned photography collection.In 2016, Collishaw created two striking new installations for the follies in the 18th century landscape surrounding Fountains Abbey and Studley Royal - a National Trust World Heritage Site in Yorkshire, UK. A co-commission between the Trust and Blain|Southern, the works drew upon the history of the buildings and are optical illusions that echo ghosts of the past. The Banqueting House became the site for a major new 3D zoetrope titled Seria Ludo. The work is a glowing, strobe lit chandelier, covered with 186 carousing Lilliputian figures. As it spins, the zoetrope animates the tableaux, bringing scenes of drunken revelry to life as characters - including a swinging monkey - eat, drink, fight and dance. In contrast, the Temple of Piety - serenely stationed at the edge of the garden’s Moon Ponds, is the setting for a work that is more tranquil, The Pineal Eye sees two parabolic mirrors face each other. The resulting optical effect creates an ethereal mirage of the Roman depiction of piety, the Grecian daughter feeding her imprisoned father from her breast, which also appears as a relief on the back wall of the Temple. In addition to the pictorial beauty offered by the water gardens, they also function as <b>hydraulic</b> <b>balancing</b> systems for the river Skell that flows through Fountains Abbey. Illustrating this form of release was one of Collishaw's main objectives when creating Seria Ludo and The Pineal Eye, two works which illustrate an explosion of tension, with themes that plumb into the follies' principles of pleasure and piety.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{increasing}} demand for sufficient and clean energy forces industrial and service companies to align their strategies towards efficient consumption. This trend refers {{also to the}} residential building sector. There, large amounts of energy consumption are caused by house and facility heating. Many of the operated hot water heating systems lack hydraulic balanced working conditions for heat distribution and –transmission and lead to inefficient heating. Through <b>hydraulic</b> <b>balancing</b> of heating systems, significant energy savings for primary and secondary energy can be achieved. This paper addresses the use of KNX-technology (Smart Buildings) in residential buildings to ensure a dynamic adaption of hydraulic system´s performance, {{in order to increase}} the heating system´s efficiency. In this paper, the procedure of heating system segmentation into hydraulically independent units (meshes) is presented. Within these meshes, the heating valve are addressed and controlled by a central facility server. Feasibility criteria towards such drivers will be named. The dynamic hydraulic balance is achieved by positioning these valves according to heating loads, that are generated from the temperature settings in the corresponding rooms.

40|$|This report {{provides}} the findings and opinions {{of a historical}} document review, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>balance</b> calculation, and proposed additional study for a property that was historically used as a bulk petroleum storage and distribution facility. The property lies along the base, west, of a heavily vegetated bluff with a tidally influenced body of water west-adjacent to the property. The western portion of the property is bounded by a seawall spanning approximately 3, 200 linear feet trending north-south. The seawall’s construction details are not known, save for a 225 -foot section of driven sheet pile wall located within the northern portion of the property’s seawall. Due {{to the presence of}} petroleum hydrocarbons in soil and groundwater at the property, a cleanup action for the property will likely be overseen by the state regulatory agency. The property is currently undergoing remedial investigation in an effort to identify the lateral and vertical extent in which contaminants at the property have come to be located, also known as the “site” as defined by the Model Toxics Control Act (MTCA). The majority of the property bounded within the seawall area has been characterized; however, the shoreline sediments located immediately west-adjacent of the seawall have not been properly delineated. Identifying the bounds of the site to the west within sediment is pivotal {{for the purposes of the}} remedial investigation. Since the west-adjacent shoreline is so extensive, conducting a complete sediment sampling event along the entire shoreline would be cost-prohibitive due to analytical costs and logistical issues at the property. Because of the extensive nature of the shoreline, it would greatly benefit the client and project to focus sampling efforts at areas of greater risk for contaminants along the shoreline by identifying potential preferential pathways for contaminants to migrate off of the property and into adjacent shoreline sediments. The review of historical studies of the property yielded some useful information; however much of the findings included within the historical studies were lacking original raw data, therefore limiting the information obtained. The calculated <b>hydraulic</b> <b>balance</b> for the property yielded a relatively large surplus of recharge to groundwater after precipitation events, reinforcing the concept that contaminant have potentially historically, and currently, been migrating into the adjacent shoreline through preferential pathways along the seawall. Due to the limitation within the historical studies for the property as well as the groundwater recharge identified in the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>balance,</b> an additional study was proposed in an effort to provide additional aquifer characteristics along the seawall, and the ability to observe flow propagation at and proximate to the seawall in two-dimensions through time without the need to piece separate studies together. This proposed study includes a single simultaneous tidal study which comprises select monitoring points along the seawall. This report has identified the need for additional data that can be collected through available avenues for the property based upon the client’s desires and project needs. Ultimately, the proposed additional study is suggested based upon its relatively low capital investment, and ability meet the requirements relevant to the specific project needs and scope. Assuming preferential pathways are identified through the additional study proposed within this report, a representative and cost-effective sediment sampling plan can then be put in place in an effort to define the site...|$|R
