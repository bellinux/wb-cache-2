50|$|CALLER: Hi, Rush. Thanks <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> <b>call.</b>|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} said that the {{dissertation}} process is a demonstration of autonomy. However, the process of this dissertation gained {{a life of its own}} in large part due to the contributions of the following individuals. I would like to acknowledge the contributions of my research participants, many of whom participated without financial compensation. It is in this generous spirit that researching practitioners can further our understanding of brain and behavior relationships. I am indebted to my dissertation chair, Dr. Doug Chute, for countless lessons (the most important of which never appeared on any syllabus). I especially appreciate his uncanny ability to contemplate the zen lessons of the IRB approval process, and <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> evening phone <b>calls</b> during the Stanley Cup playoffs (a true testament to his dedication to mentoring). I hope to meet his standards of doing sound science that matters. Dr. Tom Hewett helped me appreciate for the classic literature on social psychology and encouraged me to think critically about the implications of thi...|$|R
25|$|Please {{disregard}} {{all other}} messages which I have written, {{they are only}} thoughts which I was thinking about as possible reasons <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> own life.|$|R

6000|$|... "An {{excellent}} reason, then, <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> advice, and marrying me instantly! But you wander {{from the}} question. Where are you going? That {{is the issue}} now before the house. You persist in evading it." ...|$|R
6000|$|BUILDER. [In a voice {{different}} from any we have heard from him] Say! What business had he to touch me, a magistrate? I gave my daughter two taps with a cane in a private house, for interfering with me <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> wife home-- ...|$|R
60|$|She {{threw her}} lapful of flowers {{away from her}} {{on the table at}} which she was sitting. She became {{perfectly}} furious with him <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> side. I permitted myself (the poor child could not see it, remember), the harmless indulgence of a smile.|$|R
60|$|I {{had just}} given a porter the {{necessary}} directions <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> portmanteau to Mr. Keller's house, when I heard a woman's voice behind me asking {{the way to}} the Poste Restante--or, in our roundabout English phrase, the office of letters to be left till called for.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think we}} ever would have {{hit it off}} together; and I can't help a fancy that, after all, he didn't blame me very much <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> own way in spite of him," [...] he said. [...] "Still, it is a pity Eleanor had to come back. I suppose keeping her in Toronto {{was out of the}} question?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you'll {{have to do}} {{what you}} can to cheer up both of them." [...] Dave drew a long breath. [...] "I do wish {{somebody}} would catch those two rascals, not only on your account but on my account also. I'd like to settle matters with Porton, for having impersonated me at those stores, and <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> cap and overcoat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One cannot do everything, and I'm not insatiable. I'm {{getting too}} old to stand the shaking in the hot and dusty cars, and I can't accustom myself to going to bed in public, without undressing. No doubt, it's a matter of prejudice, but I've been used to more room <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> clothes off than they give you behind the {{flapping}} curtain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Suppose that I were Brooks or Woodhouse, {{or any of}} {{the fifty}} men who have good reason <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> life, how long could I survive against my own pursuit? A summons, a bogus appointment, and all would be over. It is well they don't have days of fog in the Latin {{countries}}--the countries of assassination. By Jove! here comes something at last to break our dead monotony." ...|$|R
25|$|My {{sister was}} slim and {{beautiful}} and friendly, and my mother always preferred her. I was the ugly duckling, fat and clumsy and unpopular. It is a cruel thing to make a child feel ugly and unwanted... I'll never forgive her <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> childhood away. During all the years I should have been playing and growing up, I was singing or making money. Everything I did for them was mostly good and everything they did to me was mostly bad.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Danvers and I {{were both}} of opinion, Mr. Hawtrey, that by his tone and manner {{when he spoke}} to you about payment of debts, that he had already done you some injury or had some {{distinct}} plan in his head. At that time your daughter was not engaged to Lord Halliburn, and his ideas may have been vague ones until the public notice of the engagement met his eye, when he may have said to himself, [...] "This is <b>my</b> opportunity <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> revenge, by annoying both father and daughter."' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You thought! you thought! Yes, {{it makes}} me {{impatient}} to hear you: but, however, you have suffered, {{and are likely to}} suffer enough <b>for</b> not <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> advice; so I'll say no more. Carter--hurry!--hurry! The sun will soon rise, and I must have him off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never mind, then; for I have {{a reason}} <b>for</b> not <b>taking</b> up <b>my</b> old cudgels against you, Elfie. Can you guess what the reason is?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I will; I will; {{it looks}} {{brighter}} and better already, and I won't lose my one comfort by any fault of my own. Thank you so much, Mother Bhaer, <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> side. I felt so ungrateful and mean and crushed when I thought you all considered me a sneak {{who had no}} business to love such a precious girl as Daisy. No one said anything, but I knew how you felt, and that Mr Laurie sent me off partly {{to get me out}} of the way. Oh dear, life is pretty tough sometimes, isn't it?' And Nat took his head in both hands as if it ached with the confusion of hopes and fears, passions and plans that proved boyhood was past and manhood had begun.|$|R
5000|$|... “My {{dear friend}} Osbald … I am {{disappointed}} in you <b>for</b> not <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> advice. I urged {{you in my}} letter that you should give up this way of life. Do not add sin to sin by ruining your country and shedding blood. Think how much blood of emperors, princes, and people has been shed through you and your clan.” ...|$|R
60|$|My fair friend, Miss Clack, having {{laid down}} the pen, {{there are two reasons}} <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>taking</b> it up next, in my turn.|$|R
60|$|THE MAN [ignoring the interruption] Bless you <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> him off <b>my</b> hands! I {{have had}} as much of him as I can bear. [He goes {{down the steps and}} disappears].|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you care}} to, by all means," [...] he answered. [...] "Tell Mr. Pengarth {{to let me}} have your address. Goodbye! Thank you <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> care of <b>my</b> treasures so well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And on {{the ground}} also with it"--Vanderbank so far concurred--"of your quite <b>taking</b> <b>for</b> granted <b>my</b> only having to put myself forward?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Louisa!' said Mr Dombey. 'It is not {{necessary}} to prolong these observations. The woman is discharged and paid. You leave this house, Richards, <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> son--my son,' said Mr Dombey, emphatically repeating these two words, 'into haunts and into society which are not to be thought of without a shudder. As to the accident which befel Miss Florence this morning, I regard that as, in one great sense, a happy and fortunate circumstance; inasmuch as, but for that occurrence, I never could have known--and from your own lips too--of what you had been guilty. I think, Louisa, the other nurse, the young person,' here Miss Nipper sobbed aloud, 'being so much younger, and necessarily influenced by Paul's nurse, may remain. Have the goodness to direct that this woman's coach is paid to'--Mr Dombey stopped and winced--'to Staggs's Gardens.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{a miserable}} fool I was!" [...] said he. [...] "I {{might have had}} that very ticket. He as good as offered to {{exchange}} with me. Such a stupid dolt as I was, not to know when it was upside down! Then, besides, I was offered two pounds for my ticket, sure--and I believe I should have taken it, if my father had not advised me not to do it. That would have come to almost fifteen dollars, and that I should have been sure of. So much <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> father's advice. I hope they'll get up another lottery to-morrow, and then I'll buy a ticket and do just as I please with it, and not take any body's advice. I shall be sure to make fifteen dollars, at least, if I don't do any better than I might have done to-day." ...|$|R
5000|$|When Sir Stanley died in 1968, Unwin {{became the}} new {{chairman}} of the firm. His father had been preparing him for the role during his time at the firm; Rayner's older brother David had decided to pursue a career as a children's author instead. David Unwin later wrote in his memoirs: [...] "I have always felt guilty at <b>my</b> defection, <b>for</b> by <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> place Rayner sacrificed his own promising career as an author".|$|R
2500|$|Barresi wrote, {{produced}} and directed award-winning adult films. In 1992 Barresi, {{using the name}} [...] "Joe Hammer", won the Gay Video Guide Award in the Best Specialty Release category for the fetish video, [...] "Razor Close". Barresi has been nominated for several other AVN Awards, including 8 nominations for the 1998 gay mafia epic which he wrote, directed, and produced, titled GoodFellas/BadFellas, and featuring him in a non-sexual role. Barresi earned a 2003 GayVN Awards nomination for [...] "Best Non-Sex Performance Gay or Bi" [...] for Long Strokes, noting he got the nod [...] "just <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> shirt off; if I knew they wanted more, I'd have done more." [...] Barresi also won the 2007 GayVN award and a 2007 Grabby award for [...] "Best Non-Sex Performance" [...] {{for his work in}} Velvet Mafia (parts 1 and 2). And in 2008, Barresi was inducted into the GayVN Hall of Fame.|$|R
5000|$|The company's logo is {{the record}} symbol, which Gordon-Levitt {{can be seen}} wearing {{frequently}} in interviews, at events and appearances. The actor/founder says [...] "that round REC button became a symbol, a metaphor <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> things into <b>my</b> own hands and doing it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but one moment," [...] said Peter. [...] "If I'm a vegetarian, {{how did you}} account <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>taking</b> all {{the chicken}} I could get at dinner last night, and looking as if I wanted more?" ...|$|R
30|$|And then {{everybody}} encouraged me <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> care of <b>my</b> dad and everybody persuaded {{me and said}} now you see you’re the older son of your dad and now he sees you here, and now he’s no longer sick, so… And I was really happy for that.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, my good woman," [...] said I, {{while the}} Bailie groaned and {{remained}} undecided, [...] "it is six hours since we dined, {{and we have}} not taken a morsel since. I am positively dying with hunger, and I have no taste <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> up <b>my</b> abode supperless among these mountains of yours. I positively must enter; and make the best apology you can to your guests for adding a stranger or two to their number. Andrew, you will see the horses put up." ...|$|R
40|$|I {{dedicate}} {{my thesis}} to my participants because without them {{this would not}} be possible. You all were more than patient with me throughout the research and writing process, and I am thankful for the friendships we created throughout this process. I also dedicate my thesis to my niece, Kailey. While writing my thesis, she told me she wanted to grow her hair out to donate to young girls like me. At the age of four, you are so smart and caring. I could not have done it without you! I want to offer special thanks my parents, Stacy and Larry, and my sisters, Kylie and Kensie, who have experienced my condition and baldness with me. Although my dreams are ever-evolving, you all continue to support me without hesitation. I also want to thank my closest friends, Ashley; Taylr; Robyn; Ericka; and Josh, and my dog, MaryJane, for simply being there for me and <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> mind off of the thesis process when I needed it the most...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he retorted, [...] "what do you expect, Percy, if {{you talk}} to them like that? But I want to thank you and your partner <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> care of <b>my</b> girl when she went to see the wreck. Fellow on the cars told me--said you were a gritty pup!" ...|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to {{acknowledge}} my parents, Erich and Nancy, for raising me to value education and for supporting me in all my interests. I thank them for attending so many of my baseball games when I was growing up, for making me practice the piano when I wanted to do anything else, for encouraging me and enforcing me in school, and for making family fieldtrips an important part of my childhood. And mostly, I thank you for caring and praying for me, despite my success and/or failure. To Nancy and Erich do I dedicate this dissertation. I thank my thesis advisor, Professor H. Eugene Stanley, for accepting me into his scientific family, <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> ideas seriously, <b>for</b> unwavering financial support and perpetual encouragement, and for patiently showing me how to present scientific research in such calculated and efficient language. I will look fondly back on the years of knocking on your office door, and waiting in anticipation to enter and “get to work. ” Your work ethic and passion for pursuing scientific beauty has infected countless collaborators and former students, and I am both proud and humbled to have worked with you. I am also grateful for your kindness, and the warmth wit...|$|R
30|$|The biggest {{saying is}} you’re the man. It’s the money but it’s also identity, who you are, your status, your values, {{integrity}} you know, …if I’m caught gambling, {{trying to put}} money on the – try to win money – I don’t try to win the money just <b>for</b> me. I’m <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> family and everything on my shoulder…so when I put money there, it’s to win the money for my family. You imagine that I lose that amount of money and I’ve {{ended up in a}} very devastating status, the amount of shame.|$|R
6000|$|They {{had heard}} of me. In the few days in which I {{had been with the}} Larramies, Miss Willoughby had written of me. They insisted that I should stay to supper, for what good reason could there be <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>taking</b> that meal at the hotel--not a very good one--when they would be so glad to have me sup with them and talk about our mutual friends? ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the time}} when I formed the plan which I have the honor to {{transmit}} to you, an abolition {{of the slave trade}} would have appeared a very chimerical project. My plan, therefore, supposes the continued existence of that commerce. <b>Taking</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> basis that I had an incurable evil to deal with, I cast about how I should make it as small an evil as possible, and draw out of it some collateral good.|$|R
