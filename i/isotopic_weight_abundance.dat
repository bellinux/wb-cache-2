50|$|Sulfur {{isotopes}} {{are frequently}} {{used to look}} for evidence of ancient euxinia. Low δ34S in black shales and sedimentary rocks provides positive evidence for euxinic formation conditions. The pyrite (FeS2) in euxinic basins typically has higher concentrations of light sulfur isotopes than pyrite in the modern ocean. The reduction of sulfate to sulfide favors the lighter sulfur isotopes (32S) and becomes depleted in the heavier isotopes (34S). This lighter sulfide then bonds with Fe2+ to form FeS2 which is then partially preserved in the sediments. In most modern systems, sulfate eventually becomes limiting, and the <b>isotopic</b> <b>weights</b> of sulfur in both sulfate and sulfide (preserved as FeS2) become equal.|$|R

The problem to solve for the efficient use of these clean and renewable energies remains their storage and transportation. In the present work, three different research subjects based on storage and transportation of renewable energies are described. 1 - In the first application the solar energy is applied to the building heating systems domain, where a good management of household thermal comfort nowadays implies the decrease in consumption of energy, while maintaining the same indoor temperature. This can be achieved through the use of thermo-chemical energy storage technology. Salt hydrates and their composites (obtained by incorporating the salt hydrates into a highly porous host matrix) have shown great potential as thermochemical heat storage materials. They can be utilized in applications such as providing heating in homes during winter (exothermic hydration of the solid material) by discharging the stored (solar) energy gained during the summer months (endothermic dehydration of the solid). For this aim, several composites were tested during hydration-dehydration in a TG-DSC apparatus. 2 - The second application implies the combined use of solar and geothermic energies for house heating systems. In summer the thermal solar energy storage is achieved using water vapour absorption-desorption in binary or ternary systems with a desiccant salt like lithium bromide, lithium chloride, zinc bromide, zinc chloride, etc. The water vapour is condensed and stored in the water tank. The resulting more concentrated solution is stored in a semi crystallized form in a second tank. In winter, the previous condensed water is evaporated at low temperature, using geothermal source, and absorbed by the highly concentrated salt solution in the absorber, thus generating thermal energy. In this work, dissolution and dilution enthalpies of various anhydrous salts were determined by titration calorimetry. 3 - The development of solid-state hydrogen storage materials with enhanced performances and improved safety is a key point for the commercialization of hydrogen as energy carrier. Mg hydride {{is one of the most}} promising materials for hydrogen storage. MgH 2 presents low cost, high hydrogen capacity, light <b>weight,</b> <b>abundance,</b> excellent reversibility, and it is relatively safe to handle. To overcome the kinetic limitation and thermodynamic stability of MgH 2, the addition of various activators has been tested by performing Pressure-Composition-Isotherm (PCI) experiments at different temperatures and temperature-programmed-desorption (TPD) measurements.

However, {{they have all}} been based on cross-species analysis and take no account of the relative abundance of species with vegetation. 2. Using two reproductive traits - seed mass and dispersal vector - as examples, a range of previously identified relationships were tested using both unweighted and weighted-by-abundance data collected from land-use transitions at 12 sites across Europe. 3. Seed mass was correlated positively with most measures of temperature (stronger relationships for unweighted data) and declined against measures of disturbance (stronger relationships with weighted data). It was not related consistently to measures of water availability. 4. There was some evidence that endozoochory was associated with damper environments, hoarding with drier ones and exozoochory with more fertile habitats. 5. Weighting reduced the slope of relationships between seed mass and environmental variables, possibly indicating that dominance within vegetation is determined by land use after the operation of a climatic filter. Fewer significant relationships were detected for weighted dispersal mechanisms compared to unweighted ones, indicating less difference of the dominants from other species with regard to this trait. 6.

Thus, based on the individual and population success of caddisflies, {{it is argued that}} the stream community in the Breitenbach was mainly driven by physical forces, temperature and discharge. Only under particular spatial and temporal conditions competition effects do become evident...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen is the viable {{energy carrier}} of future energy and {{transportation}} systems {{due to its}} clean emissions, light <b>weight,</b> and <b>abundance.</b> Its extremely low volumetric density, however, presents significant challenges to storage onboard vehicles. The study involves {{a survey of the}} current state of direct hydrogen storage technologies-cryogenic, compressed, and liquid storage-and an analysis of the problems associated with its storage. The significant storage problems that are reviewed and analyzed are issues with cool-down, boil-off, dormancy, materials, and space limitations. The goal {{of this study is to}} ultimately provide design insights on storage tanks, whether they be built for thermal performance (insulated), mechanical performance (pressure vessels), or both. The critical parameter that is analyzed is the inner shell wall thickness, or the layer that holds and encompasses the fuel. Graphs were provided to illustrate the reliance of the aforementioned problems on inner shell wall thickness. The results show that-given current materials-a nominal thickness of 10 cm is appropriate for liquid storage and a thickness of 4 cm is appropriate for flexibly fuelled storage and cryogenic compressed storage mechanisms. (cont.) Additionally, the performance of these storage mechanisms was also projected for potential future materials. The conclusions were that more research needs to be dedicated into two broad areas: thermally-efficient insulation and stronger pressure vessel materials. by Allan B. Reyes. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} assessment of marine litter in three environmental compartments of Belgian coastal waters was performed. <b>Abundance,</b> <b>weight</b> {{and composition of}} marine debris, including microplastics, was assessed by performing beach, sea surface and seafloor monitoring campaigns during two consecutive years. Plastic items were the dominant type of macrodebris recorded: over 95 % of debris present in the three sampled marine compartments were plastic. In general, concentrations of macrodebris were quite high. Especially the number of beached debris reached very high levels: on average 6429  ±  6767 items per 100  m were recorded. Microplastic concentrations were determined to assess overall abundance in the different marine compartments of the Belgian Continental Shelf. In terms of weight, macrodebris still dominates the pollution of beaches, but {{in the water column}} and in the seafloor microplastics appear to be of higher importance: here, microplastic weight is approximately 100 times and 400 times higher, respectively, than macrodebris weight...|$|R
