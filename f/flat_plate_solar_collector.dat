40|$|The {{efficiency}} of a <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> using water based CuO nanofluid {{as a working}} fluid is analyzed theoretically. A mathematical model and a program, written in MATLAB code were used for calculating the {{efficiency of}} a <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> for a domestic solar water heating system considering weather conditions of a city in Myanmar. This calculation includes three aspects. Firstly, the maximum solar energy availability for the <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> tilted at the optimum angle was estimated. Secondly, the convective heat transfer coefficient of nanofluid was calculated {{as a function of}} volume concentration and size of the nanoparticle. Thirdly, the overall heat loss coefficient of the <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> was calculated using a method of iteration. Through these calculations, the collector efficiency was obtained as a function of volume concentration and size of the nanoparticle. The results showed increasing in collector efficiency by increasing the volume concentration up to 2 % while the effect of nanoparticle size on the efficiency was marginal. The use of the CuO-water nanofluid as a working fluid could improve the efficiency of <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> up to 5 % compared with water as a working fluid under the same ambient, radiant and operating conditions...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that energy efficiency of a <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> increases without extremum points with the flow rate and likewise the fluid outlet temperature increases with the collecting area. Thus, it provides no maximum points {{for the purpose of}} optimization of solar collector design. In contrast, exergy analysis presents various local points forhex = f(m,Ac), and with a global maximum point. Based on these findings, this paper further develops the exergy analysis of a <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> by outlining the correlation between the exergy efficiency of a <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collector,</b> hex,with the outlet and inlet fluid temperature variation, âˆ†T, with respect to the influence of fluid flow rate, m, and collector area, Ac. In addition, the inter-relation between the fluid flow rate and the collector area is also examined as a ratio, R, where R = m/Ac, thus, giving hex = f(R) and DT = f(R). From these evaluations, it seems that there is a precise value of R which will give the optimum operating mode for the solar collector, either with maximum exergy efficiency or maximum temperature variation, or both, for a fixed design specification. The value of R and the corresponding values of exergy efficiency and temperature variation are evaluated in this paper for Malaysia meteorological conditions...|$|E

Solar {{energy is}} still not being used {{effectively}} in countries in the developing world, though it's a partial {{solution to the problem}} of shortage and expensive energy. Normally harvested through flat plate collectors, converting solar radiation into heat is the most direct application that can be effected in water heating systems. Many researchers have attempted to develop means of improving the efficiency of the flat plate solar energy collector; however there appears to be no evidence of any work regarding the effect of geometric configuration on the performance of <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collector.</b> This study presents results obtained when comparing the performance of a solar water heating system equipped with three manufactured <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> panels of numerically identical surface area but of different geometric configuration as they were individually attached to a typical geyser. Data was obtained inside a laboratory. The amount of heat acquired from flat plate collectors of solar energy depends primarily on their surface area that is exposed to the solar irradiance, however, the geometry of the collectors was thought that it might affect to some extent the amount of heat harvested. The circulation of the water from the panel to the geyser was due to the self-induced thermo-syphon effect. The results obtained during the test period (7 hours per day for two consecutive days) indicated that the system’s thermal efficiency was best when the square geometrical configuration collector was used. A dimensional analysis using the Π Buckingham method that was performed on the parameters affecting a <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> yielded three dimensionless numbers that lead to a power law relationship which might be useful in enhancing solar water heating systems’ design...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{investigate}} the use of low and medium temperature active solar energy systems for the disinfestation of greenhouse soils. Four <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> (low-temperature <b>solar</b> thermal energy devices) and six parabolic trough concentrators (medium-temperature solar thermal energy devices) were used to heat water, which, via a buried heat exchange system, was used to heat the soil of greenhouse plots. These treatments were compared to no solar (control) and solarized (using a 50 µm-thick transparent polyethylene sheet) plots. Experiments performed in the summers of 2004 and 2005 showed that: 1) the temperatures reached and the energy accumulated in the soil- and therefore the disinfestation capacity- were greater with either of the active solar treatments (40 - 60 ºC and 10. 222. 438 – 18. 102. 054 J, respectively) than with solarization (< 40 ºC and 6. 628. 760 J, respectively) and 2) the tem-peratures reached using the parabolic trough concentrators (50 - 60 ºC) were higher than those achieved with the <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> (40 - 50 ºC).

40|$|This work {{treats the}} thermal and {{mechanical}} performances of gas-filled, <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> {{in order to}} achieve a better performance than that of air filled collectors. The gases examined are argon, krypton and xenon which all have lower thermal conductivity than air. The absorber is formed as a tray connected to the glass. The pressure of the gas inside is near to the ambient and since the gas volume will vary as the temperature changes, there are potential risks for fatigue in the material. One heat transfer model and one mechanical model were built. The mechanical model gave stresses and information on the movements. The factors of safety were calculated from the stresses, and the movements were used as input for the heat transfer model where the thermal performance was calculated. It is shown that gas-filled, <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> can be designed to achieve good thermal performance at a competitive cost. The best yield is achieved with a xenon gas filling together with a normal thick absorber, where normal thick means a 0. 25 mm copper absorber. However, a great deal of energy is needed to produce the xenon gas, and if this aspect is taken into account, the krypton filling is better. Good thermal performance can also be achieved using less material; a collector with a 0. 1 mm thick copper absorber and the third best gas, which is argon, still gives a better operating performance than a common, commercially produced, air filled collector with a 0. 25 mm absorber. When manufacturing gas-filled <b>flat</b> <b>plate</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collectors,</b> one way of decreasing the total material costs significantly, is by changing absorber material from copper to aluminium. Best yield per monetary outlay is given by a thin (0. 3 mm) alu-minium absorber with an argon filling. A high factor of safety is achieved with thin absorbers, large absorber areas, rectangular constructions with long tubes and short distances between glass and absorber. The latter will also give a thin layer of gas which gives good thermal performance. The only doubtii ful construction is an argon filled collector with a normal thick (> 0. 50 mm) aluminium absorber. In general, an assessment of the stresses for the proposed construction together with appropriate tests are recommended before manufacturing, since it is hard to predict the factor of safety; if one part is reinforced, some other parts can experience more stress and the factor of safety actually drops...|$|R
