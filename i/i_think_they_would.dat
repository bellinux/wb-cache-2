500|$|Potter and Warne agreed {{volume of}} nursery rhymes {{would be created}} in 1905 but she also brought his {{attention}} to a story she had previously written, writing to him, [...] "I think 'Mrs. Tiggy' would be all right; it is a girl's book ... {{there must be a}} large audience of little girls. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> like the different clothes." [...] She began the illustrations in the summer once he agreed to the concept.|$|E
500|$|He {{also began}} {{studying}} revolutionary politics including the Marxist theory of Henri Lefebvre, who {{introduced him to}} the Communist poet Louis Aragon in 1928. Berni continued corresponding with Aragon after leaving France, later recalling, [...] "It is a pity that I have lost, among the many things I have lost, the letters that I received from Aragon all the way from France; if I had them today, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be magnificent documents; because in that correspondence we discussed topics such as the direct relationship between politics and culture, the responsibilities of the artist and the intellectual society, the problems of culture in colonial countries, the issue of freedom." ...|$|E
500|$|Explaining why {{he chose}} {{to make a film}} about Scientology, Gibney told Reuters that he {{considered}} it [...] "an important topic. Not only about this church of Scientology, which everybody's fascinated with partially because of the celebrities, but partially because of the way that the church seems to turn people to do things that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> normally never do if had they not entered the church." [...] Gibney, Wright, and the former Scientologists who appeared in the film told a post-screening question-and-answer session that they hoped the film would raise public awareness about the alleged abuses committed by the Church of Scientology, and would prompt the media and law enforcement agencies to investigate further. Gibney later called in a Los Angeles Times opinion piece for Scientology's tax exemption to be revoked {{in the light of the}} allegations of abuse documented in the film.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> did. <b>I</b> didn't see 'em, and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> {{go downstairs}} without using the elevator, {{although}} {{they could use}} the stairs." ...|$|R
500|$|In 1899, that {{prediction}} suddenly came true. At {{the age of}} forty-two, Elgar {{produced the}} Enigma Variations, which were premiered in London under the baton of the eminent German conductor Hans Richter. In Elgar's own words, [...] "I have sketched a set of Variations on an original theme. The Variations have amused me because I've labelled them with the nicknames of my particular friends ... {{that is to say}} I've written the variations each one to represent the mood of the 'party' (the person) ... and have written what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have written – if they were asses enough to compose". He dedicated the work [...] "To my friends pictured within". Probably the best known variation is [...] "Nimrod", depicting Jaeger. Purely musical considerations led Elgar to omit variations depicting Arthur Sullivan and Hubert Parry, whose styles he tried but failed to incorporate in the variations. The large-scale work was received with general acclaim for its originality, charm and craftsmanship, and it established Elgar as the pre-eminent British composer of his generation.|$|E
500|$|The {{circumstances}} of the sinking were featured by a BBC programme. According to this, the despatch of Gloucester, alone and low on fuel and anti-aircraft ammunition (less than 20% remaining), into danger was a [...] "grievous error". Furthermore, the failure to attempt to rescue survivors after dark was [...] "contrary to usual Navy practice". A survivor commented [...] "The tradition in the Navy is that when a ship has sunk, a vessel is sent back to pick up survivors under cover of darkness. That did not happen {{and we do not}} know why. We were picked up by Germans." [...] On 30 May 1941, {{in a letter to the}} First Sea Lord, Sir Dudley Pound, Cunningham wrote, [...] "The sending back of Gloucester and Fiji to the Greyhound was another grave error and cost us those two ships. They were practically out of ammunition but even had they been full up <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have gone. The Commanding Officer of Fiji told me that the air over Gloucester was black with planes." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} the film, Hillenburg {{wanted to end}} the series [...] "so [...] wouldn't jump the shark." [...] "We're working on episodes 40 through 60 right now, and I always looked at that as a typical run for an animated show. [...] lasted about that long, for example. And I thought now {{was a good time}} to step aside and look at a different project. I personally think it's good not to go to the point where people don't want to see your show anymore," [...] Hillenburg said in 2002. However, Nickelodeon wanted to produce more episodes: [...] "The show was such a cash cow for the station that it couldn't afford not to," [...] storyboard director Sam Henderson observed. Initially Hillenburg doubted that the network would continue the show without him, saying: [...] "I think [...] respect that my contribution is important. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> want to maintain the original concept and quality." [...] Consequently, he resigned as the showrunner and appointed his trusted staff member Paul Tibbitt to the role. Although he no longer has a direct involvement in the production of SpongeBob SquarePants, he still retains a position as an executive producer and maintains an advisory role, reviewing each episode. While he was on the show, Hillenburg voiced Potty the Parrot and sat in with Derek Drymon at the record studio to direct the voice actors while they were recording. During the fourth season, Tibbitt took on voicing for Potty, while Andrea Romano replaced the two as the voice director.|$|E

2500|$|After Epstein's death, Silvers was {{the sole}} editor until his own death in 2017. Asked about who might succeed him as editor, Silvers told The New York Times, [...] "I can think of several {{people who would be}} {{marvelous}} editors. Some of them work here, some used to work here, and some are just people we know. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> put out a terrific paper, but it would be different." [...] In 2008, the Review celebrated its 45th anniversary with a panel discussion at the New York Public Library, moderated by Silvers, discussing [...] "What Happens Now" [...] in the United States after the 2008 election of Barack Obama as president. Panelists included Review contributors such as Didion, Wills, novelist and literary critic Darryl Pinckney, political commentator Michael Tomasky, and Columbia University professor and contributor Andrew Delbanco. The 45th anniversary edition of the Review (November 20, 2008) began with a posthumous piece by Edmund Wilson, who wrote for the paper's first issue in 1963.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{concerns}} to the contrary, Glasberg denied that Ziva [...] "friend zoned" [...] Tony in the finale. He explained, [...] "It might not satisfy everyone out there, but I think we're getting there — she even reaches {{up with her}} hand and puts it very gently, and in a lovely way, on his shoulder before that kiss happens. I think there are gestures being made that have definitely advanced from where we were a year ago." [...] In response to complaints about {{the pace of the}} development, he said, [...] "There are a lot of fans {{who would like to see}} that story advance much faster than we're doing it, but I firmly believe a little goes a long way and there are ways to tease it and to flirt that are just as significant and just as meaningful." [...] He maintained, [...] "We made huge strides. Their relationship has evolved, has changed. They're a little more open with each other and a little more emotionally connected, certainly more than where we were at the beginning of the season. [...] may not be the big leap that a lot of people would like it to be, but I also feel like we're enjoying the pace at which this is happening. That's not to say we're not headed in the direction everyone would like to go, but I think we’re getting there. It's very complicated when two agents who are working together get into a relationship, and that's something that [...] would be very conscious of. So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> tread lightly, which is why, in theory, we're treading lightly and being very careful about the steps that we take." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would,</b> when I {{explained}} everything. It {{would save}} money; and papa {{would have more}} {{to bring up the}} boys with." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Those Russian {{sailors and}} {{soldiers}} drink {{an awful lot}} of vodka. <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> try to stop that. A half-drunken sailor or soldier isn't of any account." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I don't {{care much}} about the old ruins," [...] said Waldron. [...] "If the lords and noblemen are as rich as people say <b>they</b> are, <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> mend them up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have me, {{for every}} body there is grown up, and father {{seems to have}} a wish for me to be with this Aunt Lilias, because she has a schoolroom.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Eh? what? More charades? Well, {{they are}} very pretty sport, only <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> astonish the natives here a little. Are we to have the end of Shylock?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Our {{collectors}} for clerical charities {{are usually}} stern men,--very {{ready to make}} known defalcations {{on the part of}} promising subscribers. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> take care to get the money during the election.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How about meals, sir?" [...] Tom Allen asked. [...] "If {{they mean}} {{to make an}} attack <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be likely to choose meal-time, when the {{passengers}} are all below and the deck will be comparatively deserted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{if people}} care {{to read about}} a logging-camp, <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> read about almost anything. Nothing could be too common for them. You might even write about the trouble of getting cheap enough rooms in Boston." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{bought a}} country house, a sober sportsman's life, and the liking of honest friends.

6000|$|... "Yes; but {{too many}} things on board. If we threw over everything--food, and kettles, and dog, and furs--we might go {{as fast as they}} could; but even then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> beat us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have just}} {{returned}} from Paris; the first time I have been out; and, {{had it not been}} for you,' she added, 'I should not have been here to-night. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have put me in prison.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know as I {{would do}} that, captain," [...] replied George Strong. [...] "The {{classrooms}} are not touched, neither {{are some of}} the dormitories.

6000|$|... "My dear young lady," [...] I protested, [...] "I do {{not think}} that you must say that. Your mother's {{conditions}} are necessary. In fact, whether she made them or not, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be inevitable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} right, Mike, {{and we will}} take the main road. They will not be mounted, and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> stand before a charge of seven men; but they may shoot some of us as we come down upon them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{expect to}} make {{anything}} out of it, but <b>I</b> did <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be grateful," [...] said Rose on one occasion when several complaints had come in at once and Buffum had reported great difficulty in collecting the low rents.|$|R
6000|$|... "In one way we {{certainly}} have, Mr O'Joscelyn," [...] said the earl.

6000|$|The child seemed puzzled. [...] "I don't know" [...] she said, after a {{thoughtful}} pause.

6000|$|... "Yes; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> {{not have}} backed down, {{if we had}} been busy with Boers, Chinese, and black men. They were at fever heat as it was; and we could have done nothing, if we had had two hundred and fifty {{thousand}} men engaged at the Cape." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can see nothing," [...] he said, [...] "but in {{any case}} <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> attack a {{hospital}} ship. This is a dangerous area for them, too. We are bound {{to have a few}} destroyers close at hand. I wonder if Ralph--" ...|$|R
