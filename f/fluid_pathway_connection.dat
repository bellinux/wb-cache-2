To investigate whether meridian-like structures exist in fish body and operate via volume transmission in extracellular <b>fluid</b> <b>pathways,</b> we injected alcian blue (AB) under anesthesia into Gephyrocharax melanocheir, which has a translucent body. The migration of AB could be seen directly and was recorded by a digital camera. The fish was then embedded and cut transversely to observe the position of tracks in three dimensions. Eight longitudinal threadlike blue tracks were recognized on the fish. The positions of these threadlike tracks were similar to meridians on the human body. Transverse sections showed that these tracks distributed to different layers of distinct subcutaneous loose connective tissues and intermuscular septa. Lymphatic vessels were sometimes associated with the extracellular blue tracks where the migration of AB occurred.

40|$|In {{geologic}} {{imaging spectroscopy}} studies, typical end products are often mineral maps. These maps are usually ambiguous {{and form a}} limited method of representing geological information that is potentially contained in spectroscopic images. This situation can be improved by mapping the spatial configuration {{of the effects of}} geological processes instead of the solely individual minerals in a non-spatial context. This so-called process-based mapping opens the way for a truly contextual mapping approach since the spectrally detectable expressions of processes occur in specific spatial arrangements. The contextual approach will solve the ambiguity problem occurring in mineral maps and will facilitate targeting of geologic processes. End products of this approach are not mineral maps but a map of the geological process.

40|$|International audienceIn EGS {{concepts}} {{like the}} one at Soultz, knowledge of the fracture network is essential to understand reservoir behavior and plan further stimulations and long term hydraulic circulation. At Soultz, the targeted reservoir is located at a 5 km depth within the granite basement of the Upper Rhine Graben near the western border of France. This granite underwent a complex tectonic history including the Hercynian and Alpine orogeneses, leading to the currently observed fracturing. This fracturing is dominated by steeply dipping fracture sets which are distributed at various scales in the granite basement. This structural work presents the characterization of the fracture network at different scales in order to understand and model the hydro-thermo-mechanical behavior of the granite geothermal reservoir through hydraulic stimulation and subsequent circulation tests. The small-scale fracture network has been characterized based on several kilometers of high resolution borehole image logs, allowing the characterization of different sets. There was a focus on large-scale fracture zones, which are the major <b>fluid</b> <b>pathways.</b> A total of 39 fracture zones have been described in detail based on borehole data.

Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) investigations revealed that the felsic volcanic glass transformed to nm-thick smectitic flakes of the montmorillonite-beidellite series via a dissolution and reprecipitation mechanism. The process of smectite formation did not proceed through X-ray amorphous or poorly crystalline transitional phases. Alteration of the glass was found to be most pronounced adjacent to perlitic cracks and vesicles that form an interconnected network focusing fluid flow. Glass dissolution adjacent to these <b>fluid</b> <b>pathways</b> resulted in a characteristic alteration texture at the nm scale; the intensely altered groundmass contains round cavities that are partially coated or filled by smectitic flakes. The Mg content of the smectite broadly increases towards the <b>fluid</b> <b>pathways.</b> Smectitic flakes with compositions corresponding to saponite occur in the intensely altered groundmass adjacent to perlitic cracks.

A combination of petrography, mineral chemistry, and electron backscatter diffraction analyses show a spatial relationship between pseudotachylite formation, shear zone development, fluid infiltration, and metamorphism. Microfractures and backscatter imaging indicate that pseudotachylite-forming processes seismically shattered the rocks, reducing grain sizes and opening <b>fluid</b> <b>pathways.</b> Evidence of eclogite-facies metamorphism in omphacite and/or albite-diopside symplectite is found {{exclusively in the}} shear zones.

40|$|Abstract The {{portion of}} the Central American margin that {{encompasses}} Nicaragua is considered to rep-resent an end-member system where multiple lines of evidence point to a substantial flux of subducted flu-ids. The seafloor spreading fabric of the incoming Cocos plate is oriented parallel to the trench such that flexural bending at the outer rise optimally reactivates a dense network of normal faults that extend several kilometers into the upper mantle. Bending faults are thought to provide <b>fluid</b> <b>pathways</b> that lead to serpen-tinization of the upper mantle. While geophysical anomalies detected beneath the outer rise have been interpreted as broad crustal and upper mantle hydration, no observational evidence exists to confirm that bending faults behave as <b>fluid</b> <b>pathways.</b> Here we use seafloor electromagnetic data collected across the Middle America Trench (MAT) offshore of Nicaragua to create a comprehensive electrical resistivity image that illuminates the infiltration of seawater along bending faults. We quantify porosity from the resistivity with Archie’s law and find that our estimates for the abyssal plain oceanic crust are in good agreement with independent observations. As the Cocos crust traverses the outer rise, the porosity of the dikes and gabbros progressively increase from 2. 7 % and 0. 7 % to 4. 8 % and 1. 7 %, peaking within 20 km of the trench axis. We conclude that the intrusive crust subducts twice as much pore water as previously thought, significantly raising the flux of fluid to the seismogenic zone and the mantle wedge. 1...|$|R

A footwall ultramafic volcanic sequence and a hanging wall gabbro bound the mineralized iron formation which dips steeply west. Shearing occurred during deformation event Dn and a peak contact metamorphic grade of lower amphibolite fades.

With cessation or relaxation of the compression batholiths, plutons and porphyritic stocks, dykes and sills of granite to granodiorite composition intruded the folded greenstone sequence and broad contact metamorphic aureoles were formed. A period of vertically oriented, maximum compressive stress (Dn) succeeded the intrusive event. Resulting strain was focused along the footwall and hanging wall boundaries of the iron formation and shear zones with a normal movement sense developed. The hanging wall boundary of the iron formation, which was locally rotated west of north during intrusion of a pre-Dn pluton, underwent down dip or steep oblique shear movement with a normal sense.

40|$|The {{transport}} of fluids through the Earth’s crust controls the redistribution of elements to form mineral and hydrocarbon deposits, the release and sequestration of greenhouse gases, and facilitates metamorphic reactions that influence lithospheric rheology. In permeable systems with a well-connected porosity, fluid transport is largely driven by fluid pressure gradients. In less permeable rocks, deformation may induce permeability by creating interconnected heterogeneities, but without these perturbations, mass transport is limited along grain boundaries or relies on transformation processes that self-generate transient <b>fluid</b> <b>pathways.</b> The latter can facilitate large-scale fluid and mass transport in nominally impermeable rocks without large-scale <b>fluid</b> transport <b>pathways.</b> Here, {{we show that}} pervasive, fluid-driven metamorphism of crustal igneous rocks is directly coupled {{to the production of}} nanoscale porosity.

40|$|Low-permeability tight chalk {{intervals}} play a {{major role}} in North-Sea hydrocarbon fields and aquifers, since they control <b>fluid</b> <b>pathways</b> of hydrocarbons and water. Recent studies reveal that their permeability depends essentially on clay content and cementation. Therefore, three characteristic samples were selected: (A) a porous micritic reservoir chalk, (B) a cemented chalk and (C) an argillaceous chalk, the two latter being tight chalk. Micrometric pore volumes are provided by applying Focused Ion Beam-Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM), because no percolating pore network is obtained at larger scales. Voxel sizes range from 12 x 15 x 20 nm³ to 25 x 31 x 30 nm³ and resulting volumes range between 1071 µm³ and 10542 µm³. Segmentation in Matlab and 3 D rendering in Avizo allowed extracting digital pore data, including porosity, tortuosity, pore volume and pore dimensions. Digital rock porosity is consistent with He-porosity and MICP pore-throat diameters match calculated pore widths. These correlations relate to the complexity of chalk porous media which possess interconnected capillary networks. The narrowest pathways of the capillaries, captured during MICP analyses (which provides pore entries), correspond to the pore’s shortest principal axes or pore width. Average pore length is twice the size of the width. These preliminary findings confirm the potential of FIB-SEM in characterizing tight chalk microporous media. Results also show how average pore length is reduced in tight chalk, with values as low as 140 nm in argillaceous chalk and 533 nm in cemented chalk, compared to 1091 nm in micritic reservoir chalk. Pore shape analyses demonstrate that clay flakes control morphologies. Argillaceous chalk yields 35 vol% of flattened pores, while they represent only 15 and 18 vol% in micritic and cemented chalk respectively. Cements also induce pore size reductions, but will not significantly alter their shape. Pore size reductions and clogging of <b>fluid</b> <b>pathways</b> result in more tortuous paths in samples with clay or diagenetic cements. Pore network models were prepared to perform permeability simulations. Single-phase flow was simulated using the Lattice Boltzmann method, which visualizes <b>fluid</b> <b>pathways</b> and calculates permeabilities. Absolute permeabilities are in the same order of magnitude as N 2 -permeabilities. Agreement between virtual lab and measured properties shows that (1) FIB-SEM volumes qualify as representative elementary volume for tight chalks and (2) the pore network was imaged at fine enough spatial resolution to resolve its components. The impact of clay content and cementation on porosity and pore morphology in chalk is a key finding, with many possible implications such as in microscale fluid flow modeling. status: publishe...|$|R
