5|$|Crittenden {{was awarded}} an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Harvard University in 1851. Later that year, he acted as Secretary of State during the illness of Daniel Webster. In this capacity, {{he wrote a}} {{vigorous}} warning to both Britain and France about interfering <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of Cuban independence. He also encouraged adherence to the United States' traditional policy of non-interference in Europe during the celebrated visit of Hungarian revolutionary Louis Kossuth to the United States in 1851.|$|E
5|$|Both yes–no {{questions}} and wh-questions in English are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion (Am I going tomorrow?, Where can we eat?), which may require do-support (Do you like her?, Where did he go?). In most cases, interrogative words (wh-words; e.g. what, who, where, when, why, how) {{appear in a}} fronted position. For example, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> What did you see?, the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. (When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: Who saw the cat?.) Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. To whose house did you go last night?. The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.|$|E
5|$|In 1667 Nicholas Steno wrote a {{paper about}} a shark head he had dissected. He {{compared}} {{the teeth of}} the shark with the common fossil objects known as tongue stones. He concluded that the fossils must have been shark teeth. Steno then took an interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of fossils, and to address some of the objections to their organic origin he began studying rock strata. The result of this work was published in 1669 as Forerunner to a Dissertation on a solid naturally enclosed in a solid. In this book, Steno drew a clear distinction between objects such as rock crystals that really were formed within rocks and those such as fossil shells and shark teeth that were formed outside of those rocks. Steno realized that certain kinds of rock had been formed by the successive deposition of horizontal layers of sediment and that fossils were the remains of living organisms that had become buried in that sediment. Steno who, like almost all 17th century natural philosophers, believed that the earth was only a few thousand years old, resorted to the Biblical flood as a possible explanation for fossils of marine organisms that were far from the sea.|$|E

40|$|The purpose. This {{article is}} devoted to the systems {{analysis}} of theoretical and practical aspects of forming of social security system of orphans and children deprived of parental care. Methodology. Covered a topical issue – placement of the orphans and deprived of parental care children. Characterized each form of the children placement emphasizing their fundamental difference and problem questions, consequences and lacks of such determination, are lighted up. Results. Offered a new approach to the forms of the children placement. Modern realities of the state development need considerable rethinking of essence of social security of children, and accordingly raising of new tasks which this system is called to decide, and mechanisms of realization of social security of children, which must be adequate to the markets conditions. Essence and functions of population social security of orphans and children deprived of parental care, are analyzed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> article. Practical meaning. Analysis of management activity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field of social arrangement of children tells that the main its result is the arrangement of orphans and children deprived of parental care into the different forms of arrangements (adoption, guardianship (trusteeship), foster home, orphanage of family type, care home).

25|$|Even {{with this}} new title, however, the method of {{selection}} of the bishop of Rome remained much the same. Both the clergy and the laity continued {{to participate in the}} selection, along with local and imperial politics. Other trends can be observed, as well, such as father-to-son succession between Pope Anastasius I and Pope Innocent I. Emperor Honorius stepped in to resolve the schism between Eulalius and Pope Boniface I (both elected), siding with Eulalius first and then Boniface I. Honorius decreed that any future schisms should be decided by unanimous selection; although this decree has never been employed in resolving a disputed papal election, it indicates the increasing degree of imperial interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of papal succession.|$|E
25|$|Galton was {{interested}} at first <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of whether human ability was hereditary, and proposed {{to count the}} number of the relatives of various degrees of eminent men. If the qualities were hereditary, he reasoned, there should be more eminent men among the relatives than among the general population. To test this, he invented the methods of historiometry. Galton obtained extensive data from a broad range of biographical sources which he tabulated and compared in various ways. This pioneering work was described in detail in his book Hereditary Genius in 1869. Here he showed, among other things, that the numbers of eminent relatives dropped off when going from the first degree to the second degree relatives, and from the second degree to the third. He took this as evidence of the inheritance of abilities.|$|E
