40|$|The {{evolution}} of crystallographic texture during equal channel angular extrusion (ECAE) using route A {{has been investigated}} experimentally {{as well as by}} simulations for three types of materials: pure, commercially pure, and impure (cast) copper. The ECAE texture of copper can be compared with simple shear textures. However, there are deviations in terms of location of the respective components. These differences can be nearly reproduced using a recent flow line approach for ECAE deformation (L. S. Toth, R. Arruffat-Massion, L. <b>Germain,</b> <b>S.</b> C. Baik, and S. Suwas: Acta Mater., 2004, Vol. 52, pp. 1885 - 98) {{with the help of the}} viscoplastic self-consistent polycrystal model. The main texture components common to all three materials are A_ 1 _E and B_E/B_E; the latter ones are significantly stronger in the cast material. The effect of further deformation on texture modification depends on material variables, such as purity, initial microstructure, and texture...|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} paper PIERROT (BIZOT, PIERROT & POCS 1974) {{described}} the new genus Bizotia based on Paraleucobryum densifolium Thér. (THÉRIOT 1939). However, ROBINSON (1967) already made {{the presumption that}} Paraleucobryum densifolium should belong to Campylopus, notably C. argyrocaulon (C. M.) Broth. His conception of C. argyrocaulon was apparently based on MUELLER’s original description (MUELLER 1874) only, which includes {{a detailed description of}} the cross section of the costa. We examined part of the type collection of C. argyrocaulon (Wallis s. n., Colombia, NY) but this material, although MUELLER’s description is correct, does not exactly match the type material of Paraleucobryum densifolium (Troll 2144 - 2145, Colombia, PC-TH). The type material of C. argyrocaulon is identical with one of the paratypes of C. leucognodes (C. M.) Par. (<b>Germain</b> <b>s.</b> n., Bryoth. Levier, Bolivia, NY). ROBINSON also mentions Campylopus pittieri Williams (1908) under the presumed synonymy of C. argyrocaulon. Examination of the type material of the former species (Pittier 1088, Colombia, NY) shows that this species is indeed identical with Paraleucobryum densifolium...|$|R

The chronology of the sequence is based on sixteen radiocarbon dates and a tephra layer {{at the base of}} the St <b>Germain</b> II <b>s.</b> l. The pollen record, starting during the St Germain I forest phase and ending about 3000 years ago, shows that remarkable changes occurred in the floristic composition, in the structure of the vegetation and in the plant biomass, including also long-lasting periods of open woodlands, often with an appreciable floristic diversity, during the last pleniglacial. Three new vegetational oscillations (Etruria I, Etruria II and Etruria III), characterized by a well-defined vegetation composition and dynamics, have been recognized after the St Germain I forest phase and before the middle pleniglacial interstadials. New evidence has been obtained for a significant diffusion of deciduous trees in the Italian peninsula during the late-glacial...|$|R

40|$|The {{transferrin}} receptor (TfR) {{interacts with}} two proteins important for iron metabolism, transferrin (Tf) and HFE, the protein mutated in hereditary hemochromatosis. A second receptor for Tf, TfR 2, was recently identified {{and found to}} be functional for iron uptake in transfected cells (Kawabata, H., <b>Germain,</b> R. <b>S.,</b> Vuong, P. T., Nakamaki, T., Said, J. W., and Koeffler, H. P. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 16618 - 16625). TfR 2 has a pattern of expression and regulation that is distinct from TfR, and mutations in TfR 2 have been recognized {{as the cause of}} a non-HFE linked form of hemochromatosis (Camaschella, C., Roetto, A., Cali, A., De Gobbi, M., Garozzo, G., Carella, M., Majorano, N., Totaro, A., and Gasparini, P. (2000) Nat. Genet. 25, 14 - 15). To investigate the relationship between TfR, TfR 2, Tf, and HFE, we performed a series of binding experiments using soluble forms of these proteins. We find no detectable binding between TfR 2 and HFE by co-immunoprecipitation or using a surface plasmon resonance-based assay. The affinity of TfR 2 for iron-loaded Tf was determined to be 27 nM, 25 -fold lower than the affinity of TfR for Tf. These results imply that HFE regulates Tf-mediated iron uptake only from the classical TfR and that TfR 2 does not compete for HFE binding in cells expressing both forms of TfR...|$|R

Improvisational jazz is a form of music whose practitioners seek to integrate the familiar and the novel into a unified composition. Certain practices guide performers in achieving these dynamic syntheses of new and old. These practices may provide fresh insights into achieving such a synthesis in the streetscape. This thesis examines the elements, composition, and practices of improvisational jazz for potential application to the compositions of streetscapes, specifically the design of in-fill buildings. It analyzes analogous elements, composition, and practices {{in the design of the}} building facades, tests these ideas in an analysis of two case studies, and makes recommendations for urban design. by Timothy <b>Germain</b> Jones.

5000|$|The Calvary {{dates to}} 1555 {{and most of}} the {{sculpture}} involved was executed by the workshop of Henry and Bastien Prigent who also worked on the Plougonven and Lopérec calvaries. Originally a statue of St Germain {{had been part of the}} calvary but this was moved to the church porch. This statue is inscribed [...] "EN L´HONNEUR DE DIEV ET (NOTRE) DA (M) E ET MONSIEUR <b>S</b> <b>GERMAIN</b> CESTE CROIX FVST COME (N) CE 1555" [...] and this has been used to fix the calvary's date. In 1650, it was enriched by the addition of several new sculptures including the Entry into Jerusalem, the Last Supper and the scene where Jesus is washing Peter's feet. These were the work of the Yves Ozanne studio/workshop in Brest. Originally it was placed near the church porch but between 1738 and 1742, it was moved to improve access to the church. This work was carried out by the Pleyben entrepreneurs, Guillaume Le Goff, Yves Quiniou and François Motreff, and it is thought that at this time the structure could well have been modified and enlarged. The calvary has been restored on several occasions notably in 1953 and more recently in the years 1980 to 1990. The granite used came from a quarry near Gulvain.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{the field}} of severe accident, the {{description}} of corium progression events is mainly carried out by using integral calculation codes. However, these tools are usually based on bounding assumptions because of high complexity of phenomena. The limitations associated with bounding situations ([J. M. Seiler, B. Tourniaire, A phenomenological analysis of melt progression in the lower head of a pressurized water reactor, Nucl. Eng. Des. 268, 87 (2014) ] e. g. steady state situations and instantaneous whole core relocation in the lower head) led CEA to develop an alternative approach {{in order to improve}} the phenomenological description of melt progression. The methodology used to describe the corium progression was designed to cover the accidental situations from the core meltdown to the molten core concrete interaction. This phenomenological approach is based on available data (including learnings from TMI 2), on physical models and knowledge about the corium behavior. It provides emerging trends and best estimated intermediate situations. As different phenomena are unknown, but strongly coupled, uncertainties at large scale for the reactor application must be taken into account. Furthermore, the analysis is {{complicated by the fact that}} these configurations are most probably three dimensional, all the more so because 3 D effects are expected to have significant consequences for the corium progression and the resulting vessel failure. Such an analysis of the in-vessel melt progression was carried out for the Unit 1 of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant. The core uncovering kinetics governs the core degradation and impacts the appearance of the first molten corium inside the core. The initial conditions used to carry out this analysis are based on available results derived from codes like MELCOR calculation code [R. Ganntt, D. Kalinich, J. Cardoni, J. Phillips, A. Goldmann, S. Pickering, M. Francis, K. Robb, L. Ott, D. Wang, C. Smith, <b>S.</b> St. <b>Germain,</b> D. Schwieder, <b>S.</b> Phelan, Fukushima Daiichi Accident Study (Status as of April 2012), Sandia Report Sand 2012 - 6173, Unlimited Release Printed August, 2012]. The core degradation could then follow different ways: axial progression of the debris and the molten fuel through the lower support plate; lateral progression of the molten fuel through the shroud. On the basis of the Bali program results [J. M. Bonnet, An integral model for the calculation of heat flux distribution in a pool with internal heat generation, in Nureth 7 530 Conference Saratoga Springs, NY, USA, September 10 – 15, 1995 (1995) ] and the TMI- 2 accident observations [D. W. Ackers, J. R. Wolf, Relocation of Fuel Debris to the Lower Head of the TMI 2 Reactor Vessel-A possible scenario, TMI 2 pressure vessel investigation project, in Proceedings of the Open forum OECD/NEA and USNRCm, Boston, USA, 20 – 22 October 1993 (1993) ], this work is focused on the consequences of a lateral melt progression (not excluding an axial progression through the support plate). Analysis of the events and the associated time sequence will be detailed. Besides, this analysis identifies a number of issues. Random calculations and statistical analysis of the results could be performed with calculation codes such as LEONAR–PROCOR codes [R. Le Tellier, L. Saas, F. Payot, Phenomenological analyses of corium propagation in LWRs: the PROCOR software platform, in ERMSAR 2015, Marseille, France, 24 – 26 March, 2015 (2015) ]...|$|R
