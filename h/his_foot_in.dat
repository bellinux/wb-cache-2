5|$|Barton {{stayed on}} with Newcastle United {{after they were}} relegated to the Championship, playing six out of Newcastle's opening eight league matches, but {{suffered}} an injury to <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> a 3–1 win against Plymouth Argyle on 19 September. He returned in April for Newcastle, playing all nine of Newcastle's remaining league fixtures and scoring his only goal of the campaign from a free kick in a win over Peterborough United. Due to the form of Danny Guthrie and Kevin Nolan, Barton had to play left wing when he returned.|$|E
5|$|Considered the top {{high school}} player in the country, Bradley {{initially}} chose to attend Duke University {{in the fall of}} 1961. However, after breaking <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> the summer of 1961 during a baseball game and thinking about his college decision outside of basketball, Bradley decided to enroll at Princeton due to its record in preparing students for government or United States Foreign Service work. He had been awarded a scholarship at Duke, but not at Princeton; the Ivy League does not allow its members to award athletic scholarships, and Bradley's family's wealth disqualified him from receiving financial aid.|$|E
5|$|Davies and Caldwell {{began the}} 2012–13 season as first choice until an ankle injury {{sustained}} by Davies during a League Cup match at Coventry City gave Pablo an early opportunity to impress. He kept his place after Davies returned to fitness, but chipped a bone in <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> the defeat to Barnsley and {{was expected to}} be out for a month. Further injuries, the return to fitness of Caldwell, and the emergence of young left-back Mitch Hancox, which allowed Paul Robinson to partner Davies in the centre, meant that Pablo played only twice more, and he was released {{at the end of his}} contract.|$|E

5|$|Hacker {{was born}} in Duncanville, Texas; growing up, he {{attended}} Duncanville High School. He was named the starting quarterback on the school's football team his senior year, but he broke <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> the second game of the season. Although some colleges were interested in him as a football player, he decided to concentrate on baseball {{as a result of}} the injury. As a senior, he was a third-team Class 5A All-State pitcher. Currently, Hacker lives in Corsicana, Texas, with his wife, Christine, whom he married in November 2008. He is a Dallas Cowboys fan. Two of his hobbies are fishing and pool.|$|E

5|$|Jordan's {{second season}} {{was cut short}} when he broke <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> the third game of the year, causing him to miss 64 games. Despite Jordan's injury and a 30–52 record (at {{the time it was}} fifth worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history), the Bulls made the playoffs. Jordan {{recovered}} in time to participate in the playoffs and performed well upon his return. Against a 1985–86 Boston Celtics team that is often considered one of the greatest in NBA history, Jordan set the still-unbroken record for points in a playoff game with 63 in Game 2. The Celtics, however, managed to sweep the series.|$|E

Under cover of darkness and with the help of his wife, Chen climbed over the wall around his house, breaking <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> the process.|$|E
5|$|After {{his single}} season at Reedley, McCarty {{transferred}} to Western Washington University and played football for the Vikings. McCarty was immediately {{a significant factor}} in the Vikings' gameplan. In the season opener, he rushed for 139 yards and three touchdowns on 30 carries against the Humboldt State Lumberjacks. He also played a large role in the passing game early in the season, making eight receptions for 126 yards through the first two games. After starting the first seven games for the Vikings, McCarty broke <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> a game against the South Dakota Hardrockers. At the time of his injury, he led the Vikings in rushing and receiving yards. He finished the season with 492 rushing yards and five touchdowns on 130 carries, as well as 30 receptions for 278 yards. McCarty was also named a second-team all-star of the North Central Conference.|$|E

5|$|Four {{games into}} the 2009–10 season, Daniel {{suffered}} {{the first major}} injury of his career, breaking <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> {{a game against the}} Montreal Canadiens. He was sidelined for 18games, marking the first time in Henrik's career that he played without his brother for an extended period. In Daniel's absence, however, Henrik enjoyed a high-scoring start to the season. On 14 November 2009, he scored his first NHL career hat-trick in an 8–2 win against the Colorado Avalanche. Leading up to Daniel's 22 November return, Henrik scored seven goals in seven games. He continued his pace into December, recording a League-leading 25points (five goals, 20assists) in 15games to be named the NHL's First Star of the Month. The following month, he was named Second Star, having recorded 25points in 13games. On 7 January 2010, Henrik moved into top spot in the NHL scoring race, ahead of San Jose Sharks centre Joe Thornton with a three-assist night against the Phoenix Coyotes. It marked {{the first time in nearly}} five years, since Näslund was tied with Robert Lang on 18 February 2004, that a Canucks player held the League lead in scoring. During a 3–1 win against the Calgary Flames on 14 March, Henrik recorded his 416th career assist to pass Trevor Linden as Vancouver's all-time leader. On 27 March, he scored two assists against the San Jose Sharks to become the fourth Canuck in team history to record a 100-point season (after Pavel Bure, Alexander Mogilny and Markus Näslund). He was named Third Star of the Month for March after scoring 24points in 15games.|$|E
5|$|In July 803, an Abbasid army under al-Qasim, {{a son of}} the Caliph Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809), began {{advancing}} {{towards the}} Byzantine frontier. As Nikephoros had broken <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> early May, it fell to Bardanes to lead the Byzantine army against the Arabs. He therefore ordered the thematic armies of Anatolia assembled in the Anatolic Theme. In mid-July 803 (the date is variously interpreted by modern scholars as 16, 18 or 19 July), Bardanes was proclaimed emperor by the assembled troops of the Anatolic, Opsician, Thracesian and Bucellarian themes. Crucially, the Armeniac Theme, either because of its traditional rivalry with the Anatolics, or because it had not yet joined up {{with the rest of}} the army, did not join the uprising. It has also been hypothesized that Bardanes may have participated in the suppression of the Armeniacs' revolt in 793, leaving a memory of hostility towards him amongst its troops. Among the Byzantine chronicles that report on Bardanes's revolt, the 10th-century Theophanes Continuatus and the 13th-century Synopsis Chronike indicate that the troops were motivated chiefly by economic concerns. Nikephoros had initiated a strict budgetary policy to shore up the Empire's finances. The Emperor had revoked the exemption on inheritance tax for the soldiers, and had apparently left them unpaid for some time as well. Bardanes, on the other hand, had a good reputation in this regard, fairly dividing the booty won from the campaigns against the Arabs amongst the soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after birth, he {{was taken}} from his cradle and adopted by his {{maternal}} uncle Kaihupaʻa to be raised in the Hawaiian custom of hānai, an informal form of adoption between extended families practiced by Hawaiian royals and commoners alike. His uncle had been educated by the American Protestant missionary Levi Chamberlain and had served his entire life as a personal assistant and servant to King Kamehameha III and later his successor Kamehameha IV. Iaukea {{was taken to the}} kingdom's capital at Honolulu to live with Kaihupaʻa and his wife Keliaipala. They lived near the grounds of the old ʻIolani Palace, in the building of the former Royal School. Renamed Halepoepoe (meaning circular or round house), this building had been turned into a home for royal retainers and the kahu (caretakers) for the reigning King Kamehameha IV. Around the time he was five or six, Iaukea fell into a well and his uncle Kaihupaʻa broke <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> the process of saving him, later dying from the injuries he sustained.|$|E

5|$|UConn {{started the}} season strong, winning their first five games. The Huskies easily won their first game 35–3 against Division I-Football Championship Subdivision (Division I-FCS) {{opponent}} Hofstra. The second game, at Temple, was played as {{the remnants of}} Hurricane Hanna hit Philadelphia. UConn won 12–9 in overtime as Donald Brown ran for a then-career high 214yards and scored the game-winning touchdown. Connecticut next avenged their loss to Virginia from 2007, winning the rematch 45–10. Baylor was next on the schedule; the Huskies pulled out the win in a back-and-forth game, 31–28. Connecticut opened Big East conference play in their next game against Louisville. The game was not decided until UConn linebacker Lawrence Wilson returned an interception for a touchdown with 2:45 left in the fourth quarter, giving the Huskies a 26–21 lead they would not relinquish. This was the second straight season where Connecticut won their first five games; before 2007, they had not opened a season so successfully since 1995, when they won their first six straight. Following the game, UConn achieved their first and only ranking of the year, appearing at No.24 in the Associated Press (AP) and Harris polls and No.23 in the Coaches' poll. However, starting quarterback Tyler Lorenzen broke <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> the Louisville game; the Huskies {{would be forced to}} rely on backup Zach Frazer for the next few games.|$|E
5|$|Four {{games into}} the 2009–10 season, Daniel {{suffered}} {{the first major}} injury of his career, breaking <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> {{a game against the}} Montreal Canadiens. He suffered the injury after being hit by a slapshot from teammate Alexander Edler. Although Daniel finished the game and recorded three assists, x-rays several days later revealed a fracture. He was sidelined for 18 games, returning to the ice on 22 November against the Chicago Blackhawks. Soon after his return, he notched his third career NHL hat-trick in a 4–2 win against the Atlanta Thrashers on 10 December. Four days later, he was named the NHL's Second Star of the Week with seven points {{over the course of the}} week. In the final game of the regular season, on 10 April 2010, against the Calgary Flames, Daniel scored his fourth career NHL hat-trick in a 7–3 win. All three goals were assisted by his brother, helping Henrik pass Alexander Ovechkin for the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL's leading point-scorer. The last goal was chosen by TSN in a fan-voted poll as the NHL's play of the year; Daniel received a between-the-legs tip pass from Henrik near the corner boards before beating goaltender Miika Kiprusoff with a between-the-legs deke. Daniel finished the season with a career-high 56 assists and 85 points despite playing an injury-shortened 63-game campaign. His 1.35 points per game rate was third in the League behind Henrik and Ovechkin. In the subsequent 2010 playoffs, Daniel recorded ten points in the opening round against the Los Angeles Kings, including the series-winning goal in the late stages of Game 6. Against Chicago the following round, his production decreased to four points as the Canucks were eliminated in six games. In the off-season, Daniel was named to the NHL Second All-Star Team. It marked the first time since 1973–74 that two brothers were named post-season NHL All-Stars, as Henrik had been named to the First Team. They were also chosen to appear together on the cover of EA Sports' European version of the NHL 11 video game.|$|E
