40|$|The eaeA gene of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is {{necessary}} for intimate attachment to epithelial cells in vitro. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) strains also possess an eac gene and are capable of intimate attachment and microvillus effacement in vitro and in animal models. To assess {{the role of the}} EHEC <b>eae</b> <b>gene</b> in intimate attachment, we constructed an eae deletion/insertion mutation in wild-type EHEC 0157 :H 7 strain 86 - 24 by using linear electroporation of a recombinant allele. The mutant obtained was deficient in inducing f-actin accumulation in HEp- 2 cells and was incapable of attaching intimately to colonic epithelial cells in a newborn piglet model of infection. Intimate attachment in vivo was restored when the EHEC <b>eae</b> <b>gene</b> or the eaeA gene ofEPEC was introduced into the mutant on a plasmid. These results indicate that the <b>eae</b> <b>gene</b> {{is necessary}} for intimate attachment of EHEC in vivo. In addition, the complementation achieved by theEPEC locus indi-cates that the <b>eae</b> <b>gene</b> ofEHEC and the eaeA gene ofEPEC are functionally homologous. (J. Clin.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of the Escherichia coli attaching and effacing (<b>eae)</b> <b>gene</b> in strains of verotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC) isolated from cattle and humans was studied. The majority of strains isolated from humans with bloody diarrhoea or HUS and cattle with severe diarrhoea were eae positive (82 and 83 % respectively). In contrast, 59 % of VTEC isolated from asymptomatic cattle were eae negative and of the remaining 41 % that were eae positive, the majority were serotype O 157. H 7. The nucleotide sequence of the 3 ' end of the <b>eae</b> <b>gene</b> of enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) of serotype O 55. H 7 {{was found to be}} almost identical to that of serotype O 157. H 7. Specific primers are described which detect the eae sequences of VTEC serotypes O 157. H 7, O 157. H-, and EPEC serotypes O 55. H 7 and O 55. H-.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) strains can be {{detected}} by serogrouping {{and the presence of}} enterocyte attaching- effacing (<b>eae)</b> <b>gene.</b> Most EPEC strains belong to a certain O antigenic group. Locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) Pathogenicity Island contains the <b>eae</b> <b>gene</b> and secretory proteins (ESPs) that introduce the attaching-effacing lesion. LEE inserted in tRNA genes include the SelC, PheU and PheV sites. The aim {{of the present study was}} to genetically characterize EPEC strains isolated from children with diarrhea. "nMaterials and Methods: Serogrouping was performed by EPEC antisera in 321 E. coli isolates. The presence of eae, stx, espB, and eaf genes and detection of insertion sites of LEE was done by PCR using specific primers. "nResults: Seventeen (5. 3 %) isolates belonging to 7 EPEC serogroups were identified among the whole material and all carried the <b>eae</b> <b>gene.</b> None of the 321 isolates showed presence of stx gene indicating that all 17 isolates classified as EPEC by O serogrouping did not belong to the enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) group. Of these, 8 (53 %) isolates carried the eaf and 16 (94. 1 %) carried the espB gene. The insertion sites of LEE in serogrouped isolates were selC (in 6 isolates), pheU (in 7 isolates) and pheV (in 2 isolates). The insertion site in 2 isolates was not determined by PCR. "nConclusion: Serogrouping and detection of the <b>eae</b> <b>gene</b> showed to be reliable for detection of EPEC strains. No Shigatoxin- producing E. coli (STEC) strain was found among the isolates.

Although the etiology of EA is largely unresolved, increased prevalence of EA in those with {{a family history of}} congenital heart disease suggests EA has a genetic component. Copy number variants (CNVs) are a major source of genetic variation and have been implicated in a range of congenital heart defect phenotypes. We performed a systematic, genome-wide search for CNVs in 47 isolated EA cases using genotyping microarrays. In addition, we used a custom HaloPlex panel to sequence three known <b>EA</b> <b>genes</b> and 47 candidate <b>EA</b> <b>genes.</b> We identified 35 candidate CNVs in 24 (51 %) EA cases. Rare sequence variants in genes associated with cardiomyopathy were identified in 11 (23 %) EA cases. Two CNVs near the transcriptional repressor HEY 1, a member of the NOTCH signaling pathway, were identified in three unrelated cases. All other candidate CNVs were each identified in a single case. At least 11 of 35 candidate CNVs include genes involved in myocardial development or function, including multiple genes in the BMP signaling pathway. We identified enrichment of gene sets involved in histone modification and cardiomyocyte differentiation, supporting the involvement of the developing myocardium in the etiology of <b>EA.</b> <b>Gene</b> set enrichment analysis also identified ribosomal RNA processing, a potentially novel pathway of altered cardiac development in EA.

40|$|The gene(s) encoded within major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) act {{as one of the}} major genetic elements contributing to the susceptibility of murine systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We have recently demonstrated that lupus susceptibility is more closely linked to the I-E- H- 2 (b) haplotype than to the I-E+ H- 2 (d) haplotype in lupus-prone BXSB and (NZB x BXSB) F 1 hybrid mice. To investigate whether the reduced susceptibility to SLE in H- 2 (d) mice is related to the expression of the MHC class II <b>Ea</b> <b>gene</b> (absent in H- 2 (b) mice), we determined the possible role of the <b>Ea</b> <b>gene</b> as a lupus protective gene in mice. Our results showed that (i) the development of SLE was almost completely prevented in BXSB (H- 2 (b)) mice expressing two copies of the Ead transgene at the homozygous level as well as in BXSB H- 2 (k) (I-E+) congenic mice as for H- 2 (d) BXSB mice, and (ii) the expression of two functional Ea (transgenic and endogenous) genes in either H- 2 (d/b) (NZB x BXSB) F 1 or H- 2 (k/b) (MRL x BXSB) F 1 mice provided protection from SLE at levels comparable to those conferred by the H- 2 (d/d) or H- 2 (k/k) haplotype. In addition, the level of the Ea gene-mediated protection appeared to be dependent on the genetic susceptibility to SLE in individual lupus-prone mice. Our results indicate that the reduced susceptibility associated with the I-E+ H- 2 (d) and H- 2 (k) haplotypes (versus the I-E- H- 2 (b) haplotype) is largely, if not all, contributed by the apparent autoimmune suppressive effect of the <b>Ea</b> <b>gene,</b> independently of the expression of the I-A or other MHC-linked genes...|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} the expression and regulation of the MHC class II Epd gene in both cell lines and in transgenic mice. In transient transfection assays, as little as 192 bp of the Epd proximal promoter was sufficient to direct constitutive expression of a reporter gene in a B cell line and to confer inducibility by IFN-y in a macrophage cell line. To determine if the same Epd promoter sequences were also sufficient to direct correct expression in vivo, Epd transgenes bearing either 4. 1 or 0. 2 kb of upstream sequence were introduced into an inbred mouse strain with a non-expressed endogenous Ep gene. Expression of both transgenes mirrored {{the expression of the}} endogenous I-A protein in thymus, B cells and macrophages with regard to both constitutive and cytokine-inducible expression. These results indicate that for the Ep gene only 200 bp of proximal promoter sequence are required to achieve tissue-specific and cytokine-inducible expression. This is in striking contrast to the <b>Ea</b> <b>gene,</b> the only other murine class II gene whose promoter has been analyzed in vivo, which has been shown to require 2. 0 kb of upstream sequence for appropriate expression.

Altogether, 5, 001 E. coli isolates were obtained by colony counting and screened {{for the presence of}} stx and <b>eae</b> <b>genes</b> by multiplex PCR. stx-positive and eae-positive E. coli isolates were detected in 25 % of the samples collected; they were found in 13 % and 3 % of the samples obtained from treated effluent and sludge, respectively, suggesting that they could be spread into the environment. Screening of the samples collected by immunomagnetic separation allowed us to isolate 31 additional E. coli serogroup O 157 isolates.

The characteristics found in strains isolated from healthy rabbits were generally different from those observed in E. coli strains associated with disease. Thus, strains with the <b>eae</b> <b>gene</b> (74 % versus 22 %); strains belonging to serogroups O 26, O 49, O 92, O 103, and O 128 (64 % versus 12 %); rhamnose-negative strains (51 % versus 5 %); and rhamnose-negative O 103 strains with eae genes present (41 % versus 1 %) were significantly (P < 0. 001 in all cases) more frequently detected in isolates from diarrheic animals than in those from healthy rabbits. Whereas a total of 35 serogroups and 17 biotypes were distinguished, the majority of the strains obtained from diarrheic rabbits belonged to only four serobiotypes, which in order of frequency were O 103 :B 14 (72 strains), O 103 :B 6 (16 strains), O 26 :B 13 (12 strains), and O 128 :B 30 (12 strains). These four serobiotypes accounted for 48 % (112 of 231) and 5 % (4 of 74) of the E. coli strains isolated from diarrheic and healthy rabbits, respectively. Only six strains were toxigenic (three CNF 1 +, two CNF 2 +, and one VT 1 +).

In this study we investigated the prevalence of STEC in hospitalized diarrhea patients (children) in Faisalabad region of Pakistan. Methodology: We used a multiplex polymerase chain reaction to characterize local isolates of STEC from stool samples of 200 children during the summer season of 2005. The targeted genes were stx 1, stx 2, hly, and eae, representing Shiga toxin 1, Shiga toxin 2, enterohemolysin and intimin respectively. Presence of stx 1 and stx 2 was confirmed by PCR followed by restriction analysis with Tail and HaeIII respectively. Serological examination was carried out by using polyvalent antisera followed by monovalent antisera for O 26 and O 157. Results: Multiplex PCR results showed that 22 (11 %) of the patients were positive for stx genes. Among other virulence factors, plasmid borne hly and <b>eae</b> <b>genes</b> were detected in 13 (6. 5 %) and 16 (8. 0 %) patients respectively. However, only 14 STEC isolates were obtained.

40|$|Episodic ataxia (EA) syndromes are {{heritable}} diseases {{characterized by}} dramatic episodes of imbalance and incoordination. EA type 2 (EA 2), {{the most common}} and the best characterized subtype, is caused by mostly nonsense, splice site, small indel, and sometimes missense mutations in CACNA 1 A. Direct sequencing of CACNA 1 A fails to identify mutations in some patients with EA 2 -like features, possibly due to incomplete interrogation of CACNA 1 A or defects in other <b>EA</b> <b>genes</b> not yet defined. Previous reports described genomic deletions between 4 and 40 [*]kb in EA 2. In 47 subjects with EA (26 with EA 2 -like features) who tested negative for mutations in the known <b>EA</b> <b>genes,</b> we used multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification to analyze CACNA 1 A for exonic copy number variations. Breakpoints were further defined by long-range PCR. We identified distinct multi-exonic deletions in three probands with classic EA 2 -like features: episodes of prolonged vertigo and ataxia triggered by stress and fatigue, interictal nystagmus, with onset during infancy or early childhood. The breakpoints in all three probands are located in Alu sequences, indicating errors in homologous recombination of Alu sequences as the underlying mechanism. The smallest deletion spanned exons 39 and 40, while the largest deletion spanned 200 [*]kb, missing all but the first three exons. One deletion involving exons 39 through 47 arose spontaneously.

40|$|Abstract Background Typical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (t-EPEC) {{are known}} to cause {{diarrhea}} in children but it is uncertain whether atypical EPEC (a-EPEC) do, since a-EPEC lack the bundle-forming pilus (bfp) gene that encodes a key adherence factor in t-EPEC. In culture-based studies of a-EPEC, the presence of another adherence factor, called EHEC factor for adherence/lymphocyte activation inhibitor (efa 1 /lifA), was strongly associated with diarrhea. Since a-EPEC culture is not feasible in clinical laboratories, we designed an efa 1 /lifA quantitative PCR assay and examined whether the presence of efa 1 /lifA was associated with higher a-EPEC bacterial loads in pediatric diarrheal stool samples. Methods Fecal samples from children with diarrhea were tested by qPCR for EPEC (presence of <b>eae</b> <b>gene)</b> and for shiga toxin genes to exclude enterohemorrhagic E. coli, which also contain the <b>eae</b> <b>gene.</b> EPEC containing samples were then tested for the bundle-forming pilus gene found in t-EPEC and efa 1 /lifA. The <b>eae</b> <b>gene</b> quantity in efa 1 /lifA-positive and negative samples was compared. Results Thirty-nine of 320 (12 %) fecal samples tested positive for EPEC and 38 / 39 (97 %) contained a-EPEC. The efa 1 /lifA gene was detected in 16 / 38 (42 %) a-EPEC samples.

Conclusions Atypical enteropathogenic E. coli-positive diarrheal stool samples containing the efa 1 /lifA gene had significantly higher bacterial loads than samples lacking this gene. This supports the idea that efa 1 /lifA contributes to diarrheal pathogenesis and suggests that, in EPEC-positive samples, efa/lifA may be a useful additional molecular biomarker...|$|E

A total of 170 VTEC strains were isolated during 21 weeks from 130 (20 %) of 664 samples from calves and from 40 (47 %) of 86 samples from their dams.

In this study, a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) method was developed as a molecular method to detect and quantify Shiga toxin genes stx 1 and stx 2 and the intimin <b>gene</b> <b>eae.</b> Subsequently, 59 fecal samples from six farms were tested using qPCR and a culture method as a reference. Three farms had contaminated animals as demonstrated by the culture method. Culture-positive farms showed moderate significantly higher stx prevalences than culture-negative farms (p = 0. 05). This is the first study which showed preliminary results that qPCR can predict STEC farm contamination, with a specificity of 77 % and a sensitivity of 83 %, as compared with the culture method. Furthermore, the presence or quantity of stx genes in feces was not correlated to the isolation of STEC from the individual animal. Quantitative data thus did not add value to the results. Finally, the detection of both stx and <b>eae</b> <b>genes</b> within the same fecal sample or farm using qPCR was not correlated with the isolation of an eae-harboring STEC strain from the respective sample or farm using the culture method...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 39 E. coli strains {{isolated}} from cloacal swabs and unhatched eggs of Audouin’s gulls (Larus audouinii) living the Salento coast (Italy) were serotyped and molecular characterized {{for the presence}} of irp 2, fyuA, tsh, papC, fimC, iucD, and <b>eae</b> <b>genes</b> described for Avian Pathogenic E. coli (APEC). Eight different serogroups (O 1, 06, 08, 015, 075, 0139, 0146, 0147) were distinguished: we recorded a very high rate of untypeable strains. Genotyping by PCR achieved to detect fimC and irp 2, described for APEC strains, as most predominant genes circulating in the gulls population, accounting for 94. 87 % and 97. 43 % respectively. Nevertheless, a significant co-existance of virulence genes was demonstrated to belong to E. coli of eggs origin. Particularly, fimC/tsh/iucD pathotype, recognized as most responsible of illness in poultry, emerged in 8. 69 % of E. coli of eggs origin...|$|R
40|$|I {{wanted to}} thank you for {{organizing}} the meeting. My interest in EHEC/STECs started in 1988, I firmly believe that the Stx/eae combination of virulence factors should be considered an adulterant. This will only benefit the beef industry at the long run. I have attached one of my papers on the subject, we have repeated the study several times, the results are the same, retail ground beef contains STECs with Stx/ <b>eae</b> <b>genes</b> at 1 %- 2 %. Below is analysis of about 10 % of our available data in our trim testing program. I would be happy to share our data with your group. I should add that {{over the past few years}} I have steadily made the same offer, and there has never been any interest from the risk assessment or the policy group Table 1 : Frequency of samples yielding positive PCR signal...|$|R
40|$|Escherichia coli is {{a natural}} {{inhabitant}} of the intestines of both humans and animals, {{but there are also}} several pathogenic types of E. coli which cause disease in humans. Strains of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) have been associated with outbreaks of diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome in humans. Most clinical signs of disease arise {{as a consequence of the}} production of shigatoxin 1 and 2 or combination of these toxins. Other major virulence factors include EHEC hemolysin and intimin, the product of the <b>eae</b> <b>gene</b> that is involved in attaching and effacing adherence phenotype. EHEC has also been associated with uncomplicated diarrhea. The capacity to control EHEC disease and to limit the scale of outbreaks is dependent upon prompt diagnosis and identification of the source of infection. The principal reservoirs of EHEC are cattle and food products, which presumably have come into contact with domestic animal manure and/or are inadequately pasteurised, these are important vehicles of infection. In the present study, the PCR technique with primers detecting the verocytotoxin genes was shown to be a possible method to screen for and identify EHEC. In summary stx genes were detected in 16 samples of 228 sampels and the <b>eae</b> <b>gene</b> was detected in 2 samples using PCR...|$|E
40|$|Foodborne {{illnesses}} {{caused by}} Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) {{are due to}} the consumption of contaminated food and water. Encoded by the <b>eae</b> <b>gene,</b> attachment and effacing lesions on human intestinal lining are produced by EHEC. The {{purpose of this study}} was to prove the concept that RNA from EHEC can be extracted and reverse transcribed to detect the <b>eae</b> <b>gene.</b> Previous studies detected eae in E. coli 0157 :H 7 by real-time reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR); however, no studies have used RT-qPCR to detect eae in multiple EHEC strains. RNA from E. coli serogroups, 026, 045, 0 I 03, 0111, 0121, 0145, and 0157, was extracted with the Kingfisher Total RNA kit and reverse transcribed. Housekeeping gene, gstA, and virulence gene, eae, were detected with RT-qPCR. Crossing point (CP) values for gstA and eae with SYBR Green I qPCR averaged I 8. I 0 � 0. 64 and 34. 44 � 1. 40, respectively. Hybprobe qPCR, used for eae comparison, resulted in lower CP values compared to SYBR Green, 22. 70 � 1. 46 versus 34. 44 � 1. 40. Method specificity and detection I imit was assessed. Hybprobe qPCR was more specific and sensitive than SYBR Green l qPCR. The current study supports the proof of concept and hybprobe qPCR would be used as end-point the detection step in further experiments...|$|E
40|$|A {{study on}} the {{prevalence}} of the faecal carriage of Escherichia coli O 157 in lambs was performed in the major slaughterhouse in Rome, central Italy, during 2002. A total of 643 animals, consisting of 378 weaned and 265 suckling lambs, were assayed {{for the presence of}} E. coli O 157. Five O 157 -agglutinating E. coli strains were isolated (0 · 8 %, 95 % CI 0 · 3 – 1 · 9). Only one was positive to PCR specific for the <b>eae</b> <b>gene</b> and produced verocytotoxin VT 2, with a VTEC O 157 overall prevalence of 0 · 2 % (95 % CI 0 · 0 – 1 · 0), whereas one strain possessed the <b>eae</b> <b>gene</b> only. All the other isolates were negative for the presence of all the virulence genes considered. The animals were either from local farms or imported from Eastern Europe. The results suggest an age-specific difference since the microorganism was isolated only from 0 · 3 % (95 % CI 0 · 0 – 1 · 7) of weaned lambs, while all samples from suckling lambs tested negative. From this study, the overall risk of human exposure to pathogenic E. coli O 157 from lamb meat consumption derived from the major slaughterhouse in Rome can be considered reasonably low, particularly when suckling lamb meat is considered...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{if there}} is a reservoir of Escherichia coli O 157 in Norwegian cattle, faecal samples from 197 cattle herds were screened for E. coli O 157 by the use of immunomagnetic separation (IMS) and PCR during the 1995 grazing season. Six E. coli O 157 :H-isolates were detected in two herds, one isolate in one and five in the other. The isolates carried the stx 1, stx 2, and <b>eae</b> <b>genes,</b> and a 90 MDa virulence plasmid. They were toxinogenic in a Vero cell assay. From 57 other herds, 137 faecal samples were positive for stx 1 and/or stx 2 genes detected by PCR run directly on IMS-isolated material. Among these samples, stx 2 were the most widely distributed toxin encoding genes. No difference was found among milking cows and heifers in the rate of stx 1 and/or stx 2 in positive samples...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was the {{isolation}} of both E. coli O 157 and non-O 157 in sheep. Verotoxins (VT) 1, 2 and <b>eae</b> <b>genes</b> were tested for this propose. Sheep faces are an important source of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 is a highly virulent food-borne pathogen and threat to public health. Rectal swab samples from sheep were collected during 2009 - 2010. Conventional plating and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) were carried out according to virulence factors (Stx 1, Stx 2 and eae A). There significant differences between prevalence of STEC and session were observed. It was at highest in spring and late summer. Six (3. 92 %) sheep carcasses were contaminated by E. coli O 157 :H 7. Only six samples were positive by PCR specific for the VT 2 gene and produced verocytotoxin VT 2, whereas all isolates were negative for the presence of VT 1 and <b>eae</b> virulence <b>genes</b> considered. Geographical variations and season may be influenced in the prevalence rate. The composition of the gastrointestinal flora may be changed by different diet and, therefore O 157 STEC rate in sheep and lamb was different. Iranian sheep indicated as a natural host of E. coli O 157 strains therefore, may be potentially pathogenic for humans. This is the first report of E. coli O 157 detection from sheep in Iran...|$|R

From February to November 2004, 670 samples of bovine mastitic milk from which 231 Escherichia coli strains were isolated, were collected from two Brazilian states. The strains were screened {{for the presence of}} Shiga toxin-producing (stx 1 and stx 2) and intimin (<b>eae)</b> <b>genes.</b> Twenty (8. 6 %) strains were detected by PCR to harbor the Shiga toxin genes (8 the stx 1 gene, 12 the stx 2 gene and none both of them). Two (0. 8 %) of the Escherichia coli strains studied were eae positive non Shiga toxin-producing. The strains were also examined for resistance to 12 antimicrobial agents. The predominantly observed resistance was to tetracycline (92. 2 %), streptomycin (90. 4 %), nalidixic acid (88. 3 %), amikacin (86. 5 %) and cephalothin (84. 8 %).
