5|$|The GWR {{attracted}} the attention of the artists from an early date. John Cooke Bourne's History and Description of the Great Western Railway was published in 1846 and contained a series of detailed lithographs of the railway that give readers a <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the line looked like in the days before photography. J. M. W. Turner painted his Rain, Steam and Speed - The Great Western Railway in 1844 after looking out of the window of his train on Maidenhead Railway Bridge, and in 1862 William Powell Frith painted , a large crowd scene on the platform at Paddington. The station itself was initially painted for Powell by W Scott Morton, an architect, and a train was specially provided by the GWR for the painting, in front of which a variety of travellers and railway staff form an animated focal point.|$|E

Since 2003, the Sassanid castle has been listed on Russia's UNESCO World Heritage list.|$|E
25|$|The first {{platform}} game to use scrolling graphics came {{years before}} the genre became a trend. Jump Bug is a simple platform-shooter developed by Alpha Denshi under contract for Hoei/Coreland and released to arcades in 1981, only five months after Donkey Kong. Players control a bouncing car that jumps on various platforms such as buildings, clouds, and hills. As part of a nascent genre, its development was not strongly influenced by existing conventions, nor was it {{said to be a}} major influence on games immediately after it. Jump Bug offered an early <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was to come, with uneven, independently suspended platforms and levels that scroll both horizontally and vertically. This style of gameplay was further refined in the arcades by such games as 1983's Major Havoc.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the resort}} homes and {{buildings}} from the Neptune beach era still exist in present-day Alameda. The Croll Building, {{on the corner of}} Webster Street and Central Avenue, was the site of Croll's Gardens and Hotel, famous as training quarters for some of the greatest fighters in boxing history from 1883 to 1914. James J. Corbett, Bob Fitzsimmons, Jim Jefferies, Jack Johnson, and many other champions all stayed and trained here. Today this beautifully preserved building is home to Croll's Pizza and the 1400 Bar & Grill Restaurant. Neptune Court, just a block away on the corner of Central Ave. and McKay Ave., provides another <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> resort life was like in Alameda in the 1920s. A short walk near Crab Cove will reveal many more historic gems.|$|E

The review continued: [...] "Sparkle in the Rain is a <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> {{to come from}} Simple Minds. Kerr's heart-wrenching vocals soar and such emotion only leads to earning a global following." ...|$|R

25|$|The {{spending}} saw a good return, with Chelsea finishing as Premiership runners-up (their best league finish for 49 years) {{and reaching}} the Champions League semi-finals after dramatically beating Arsenal in the quarter-finals. But Ranieri {{may have been}} sacked because of some bizarre tactical decisions in the semi-final loss against Monaco (for example, switching central midfielder Scott Parker to right-back and right-back Glen Johnson to centre-back to accommodate more attackers in the team) and for ending the season trophyless. Nevertheless, Ranieri was given a hero's send-off in his final match in charge. That match also gave Chelsea fans a <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{could easily have been}} if not for Abramovich's takeover, as Chelsea handily beat Leeds United, who were relegated, managerless, virtually bankrupt and seemingly destined for oblivion. In Ranieri's place, Abramovich recruited José Mourinho (who had lifted two Portuguese league titles, a Portuguese Cup, a Champions League title and a UEFA Cup with Porto) as the club's new manager. Abramovich also brought legendary Dutch scout Piet de Visser, who scouted Ronaldo and Romário for PSV, and {{is considered one of the}} greatest scouts in history.|$|E

50|$|According to swedish {{researcher}} Tommy Kuusela, Årsgång was {{a complex}} form of divination in Swedish folk tradition, usually practised at Christmas or New Year’s Eve. The phenomena could vary greatly regionally {{or even in}} the same district, but the general course was the same: if the practicers ("year walkers") had managed to follow certain instructions and to solve particular challenges (such as encounters with supernatural beings), they would catch <b>glimpses</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> would happen the following year.|$|R

500|$|Other reviews were mixed. Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan {{wrote that}} [...] "Keith himself is {{responsible}} {{for all of the}} album's good moments. Even when he's in unhinged-rant mode, Keith's imagery often remains lucid. And so the album's best song is [...] "Ants," [...] where he comes off frantic but omnipotent...It's dense and fascinating stuff, a tantalizing <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> might've happened if Keith hadn't treated the reemergence of his most popular persona like an easy payday." [...] PopMatters writer Michael Frauenhofer wrote that [...] "The Return of Dr. Octagon is still better than anything Kool Keith's done in a little while, but apart from its best tracks, it's not close to the level of his finest work of the past, and it doesn't really build much on the legend of Dr. Octagon, which still rests most firmly on the good doctor's debut." ...|$|E
500|$|Propaganda and {{censorship}} {{were closely}} linked during the war. The {{need to maintain}} morale and counter German propaganda was recognised early in {{the war and the}} War Propaganda Bureau was established under the leadership of Charles Masterman in [...] The Bureau enlisted eminent writers such as H G Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle, Rudyard Kipling as well as newspaper editors. [...] Until its abolition in 1917, the department published 300 books and pamphlets in 21 languages, distributed over 4,000 propaganda photographs every week, and circulated maps, cartoons, and lantern slides to the media. [...] Masterman also commissioned films about the war such as The Battle of the Somme, which appeared in , while the battle was still in progress as a morale-booster and in general it met with a favourable reception. The Times reported on [...] 1916 that [...] "Crowded audiences... were interested and thrilled to have the realities of war brought so vividly before them, and if women had sometimes to shut their eyes to escape for a moment from the tragedy of the toll of battle which the film presents, opinion seems to be general that it was wise that the people at home should have this <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> our soldiers are doing and daring and suffering in Picardy".|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to [...] "Sunshine Days" [...] was mixed. Aaron Kinney from Salon {{magazine was}} critical of the producers' idea to air the entry as the penultimate episode {{leading up to the}} heavily-promoted series finale. Kinney pointed out that the episode {{had little to do with}} the show's overarching storyline, but it was nevertheless touted as part of The X-Files [...] "Endgame" [...] promotion strategy. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it a [...] "C" [...] grade. She sarcastically wrote, [...] "nine years of mytharc to start to wrap up. And so the penultimate episode of The X-Files, naturally, is devoted to The Brady Bunch." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two noted that the episode [...] "is not one of Gilligan's very best stories", citing issues with its tone and its characterization of Oliver Martin. The two, however, did praise Gilligan's humanized style, writing, [...] "he gives Scully the proof of the paranormal she's been needing" [...] but shows that the most important [...] "things to care about in life" [...] are [...] "humans". John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it a 7 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this was a pleasant yet bittersweet episode, one that leaves the characters in relative peace. It is the first time that we get a <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the writers are thinking as the series comes to a close. Now all that's left is the mythology, which I can only hope will end on a similarly pleasant note." [...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, said that [...] "the central story falls a bit flat", but the episode worked well as a [...] "paean to medium of television itself" [...] and he felt it was an appropriate vehicle for the series' penultimate installment.|$|E
