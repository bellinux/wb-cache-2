[...] He later elaborated, [...] "The last thing I {{want to do is}} go back to the same character...I want to bring in (a new character) who is working for Interpol or the Royal Australian Navy, someone foreign who brings a whole new attitude.

50|$|Let's {{just say}} that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> these {{characters}} back in a very big way, but {{the way that the}} deal was initially structured, it's next to impossible to go back and publish these books.|$|R

6000|$|... 29. The subject which <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> {{before you}} is now branched, and worse than branched, reticulated, {{in so many}} directions, that I hardly know which shoot of it to trace, or which knot to lay hold of first.|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to point out {{improvisation}} as a phenomenon. Phenomenon occurring not just in the lifes of dancers but artists in general. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> it closer <b>to</b> all of us- human beings because after all we all use it in our everyday lifes. The work is conceived from a teachers view, with regards to all potential students, offering them practical movement qualities, they should cover. Space is the point of view which was chosen to look at improvisation in a detail. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> theoretical notes in harmony togehter with the practical ones. To interweave the work with my own experiences and thus give it a part of myself...|$|R

I grew up around people like that, so I felt being in that {{environment}} <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> that into my music and into the soca arena.

I ain't used to going round alone." ...|$|R
60|$|You ask if I {{should not}} like {{to go in the}} regular army. I should not. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> my {{children}} up to useful employment, and in the army the chance is poor.

2500|$|In the post-fight {{interview}} Mayweather said, [...] "My last training day, I hurt my {{rotator cuff}} {{in my left}} shoulder, so I couldn't use my jab the way <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to.</b> My left wasn't as strong as <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> it <b>to</b> be, but <b>I</b> didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> have no excuses, you know, like other champions, you know, when they get hurt they won't even show up to the fight.

5000|$|He {{says of the}} time: “It wasn’t just a {{name change}} but a {{realisation}} of what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be, a leader not a follower. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> a different element to the soca industry. It was so normal to sing a party song, festival tune, or road march contender, simply seeking a limited goal of touring after carnival (and settling for that). <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> stand out. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> teach. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> people <b>to</b> listen - not just follow instructions, like put yuh hand in the air.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Previewing the {{new record}} {{in a small}} setting gives my fans an {{exclusive}} experience where they can truly hear and see exactly where I'm going with Ciara: The Evolution.
