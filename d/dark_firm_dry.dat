Samples of Pectoralis major m from 47 -day-old broilers of commercial lineage were analyzed. The results indicated that water-bathing birds just before journey over 3. 0 km promoted the occurrence of 46. 0 % of PSE and 4. 0 % of DFD-like meat, while birds under non-water bathing conditions presented 14. 7 and 2. 0 %, respectively. For a distance of 68. 0 km, the occurrences of PSE-and DFD-like meat were 44. 0 and 0. 0 % under water bathing conditions, and 52. 0 and 0. 0 % without water bathing, respectively. Water bathing at the farm was a critical manoeuvre for increasing the unfavourable truck microenvironment for short journey, whereas conversely for longer journey it was less stressful influencing the broiler breast meat quality.

40|$|The {{level of}} pork quality in three Queensland pig {{processing}} facilities was assessed {{as part of}} the Pig Research and Development Corporation (PRDC) National Pork Quality Improvement Program (NPQIP). The program aims to achieve a 50 % reduction in the incidence and commercial impact of pale, soft and exudative pork by determining the level of pork quality at each processing facility and recommending improvements. A total of 1, 366 carcases was sampled from three processing facilities. Carcases were sampled over three days at each facility, representing approximately 25 % of the kill for those days. Pork quality was deter-mined by measuring pH and light scatter in the loin and ham of every carcase. Carcases were described as either extensive soft and exudative, localised soft and exudative, reddish-pink, firm and non-exudative, localised <b>dark,</b> <b>firm</b> and <b>dry</b> or extensive <b>dark,</b> <b>firm</b> and <b>dry.</b> The processing operations from unloading to chilling were also appraised at each facility to identify ways of improving pork quality. The overall level of soft and exudative and <b>dark,</b> <b>firm</b> and <b>dry</b> pork was 31. 0 % and 30. 5 %, respectively. The level of soft and exudative pork was lower than the national average and the level of <b>dark,</b> <b>firm</b> and <b>dry</b> pork was higher than the national average. Factors contributing to the incidence of soft and exudatuve and <b>dark,</b> <b>firm</b> and <b>dry</b> pork included inadequate resting of pigs before slaughter, holding pigs overnight without feed, excessive use of electric goads, long processing times and slow carcase chilling rates...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} at the Kumasi Abattoir Company Limited (K. A. C. L) in Ghana to assess the effect of pre-slaughter handling on welfare and meat quality of cattle. Behaviour measurements were done on 200 cattle pre-slaughter and the methods by which the cattle were handled were recorded to evaluate the effect of pre-slaughter handling on their welfare. Ultimate pH 24 and percent cooking loss were measured on 50 poorly-handled cattle pre-slaughter. The cattle were poorly-handled because they were beaten and, whipped. Based on pH 24, meat quality was assessed as normal (pH from 5. 5 – 5. 8), moderate <b>dark,</b> <b>firm</b> and <b>dry</b> (DFD) (5. 8 ≤ pH ≤ 6. 2), and DFD (pH from 6. 2 – 6. 7). Five hundred carcasses were visually observed for bruising in them {{and the number of}} non-ambulatory cattle slaughtered in a week was recorded. The relationship between pH 24 value and cooking loss in meat from the 50 poorly-handled cattle was investigated. Behaviours exhibited by poorly-handled cattle pre-slaughter included raising of their tail, kicking, lying down and refusing to move, jumping, vocalising, panting, and charging at handlers. Also lashes/whips, pulling of animals’ tails, stamping on their tails, and hitting them with sticks, stones and ropes were among the prominent methods by which the cattle were handled. Mean pH 24 and mean percent cooking loss were significant (p < 0. 05) at 6. 22 ± 0. 10 and 22. 51 ± 3. 25, respectively, for poorly-handled cattle. There was a strong negative correlation between pH 24 and percent cooking loss in poorly-handled cattle (r = − 0. 77). Out of the 500 carcasses assessed for bruising, 18 % had no bruises, 60 % had slight bruises while 22 % had severe bruises. Ninety (90) non-ambulatory cattle were slaughtered within seven (7) days, representing 7. 1 % {{of the total number of}} cattle slaughtered within that period. The results indicated that handling of cattle pre-slaughter have effects on their meat quality and welfare. Eighty-two percent of the bruised carcass and 7. 1 % of non-ambulatory animals indicated poor meat quality.

40|$|Carcass {{and lean}} quality traits were studied in two genetic lines of pigs {{in which the}} {{halothane}} allele n was segregating with the normal allele N. One line had been selected for high growth rate and low backfat depth and the other line maintained as an unselected control. Pigs of the three segregants NN, Nn and nn from both lines were grown at two locations, one near the abattoir (1 h by road) and the other far (10 h) from the same abattoir. Pigs from both locations were fasted for 20 h before slaughter. Relative to control line pigs, those from the selected line had lower backfat depths, greater ham weights, eye muscle areas and carcass lengths but lower dressing percentages. The n allele {{had little effect on}} carcass traits but for lean quality traits, the n allele acted additively to increase acidity, paleness, water lost through drip, centrifugation and cooking and to reduce cured yield. Independently of the n allele, selection for lean growth increased the incidence of <b>dark,</b> <b>firm</b> and <b>dry</b> (DFD) pork.

40|$|The {{study will}} {{discussed}} {{the effects of}} pre-slaughter stress on meat animals and consequently, on the end product which is the carcass/meat. Meat consumers nowadays are increasingly demanding that animals be reared, handled, transported and slaughtered humanely. In Botswana animals submitted to processing plants for slaughter are usually exposed {{to a lot of}} stressful situations immediately before slaughter. They are transported in trucks and/or trekked on foot for very long distances even during extremes of weather, with minimal chances of grazing, drinking water and resting. The stressful conditions through which the animals undergo have been proven to have deleterious effects {{on the quality of the}} animals carcasses and/or meat. These conditions according to a lot of literature lead to <b>dark,</b> <b>firm</b> and <b>dry</b> and pale, soft and exudative meat. Although physiochemical quality of meat can be improved through post-slaughter carcass handling treatments, the general consumer perception of carcass/meat quality (shelf life, visual appearance and palatability) can only be enhanced by improved animal handling practices such as reducing pre-slaughter stress. Based on literature, recommendations are made from which animal handlers in Botswana can learn, so that where possible, stressful situations on animals are avoided or minimised during periods immediately prior to slaughter...|$|R
40|$|Recently, we have {{identified}} the ubiquitin conjugate, protein phosphatase inhibitor 1 (I 1), from postmortem muscles. Since I 1 {{is one of the}} important regulators of glycogen metabolism, the effect of this conjugate (Ub-I 1) present in postmortem muscle on glycolysis was investigated. Two sample groups were distinguishable: those not containing Ub-I 1 (I, n= 5) and those containing Ub-I 1 (II, n= 27). Due to the enormous variation in ultimate pH at 48 h postmortem, the latter group was subcategorized into a IIa group showing lower or normal pH and a IIb group showing higher or <b>dark,</b> <b>firm,</b> <b>dry</b> meat pH. Postmortem glycolysis occurred rapidly and vigorously among group I samples. The rate and extent of postmortem glycolysis was typical in group IIa samples while it was slower and weaker in group IIb samples although they had similar glycolytic potential. This discrepancy between sample groups IIa and IIb corresponded to the Ub-I 1 abundance. Thus, the relative Ub-I 1 abundance appears to correlate with postmortem glycolysis. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Carcass {{lean meat}} yield {{is a key}} profit driver within the sheep and beef industries, and is {{improved}} by selection for muscling. This selection causes muscle hypertrophy which is associated with greater proportions of fast-gylcolytic type IIX myofibres in both cattle and sheep (Wegner el al., 2000; Greenwood el aI., 2007). Muscle tissue that is high in type IIX myofibres will also have increased gylcolytic and gylcogenolytic capacity (Wegner el al, 2000), {{which is likely to}} result us a greater potential for stress/adrenaline induced muscle glycogen depletion. This has great relevance to industry, as low muscle glycogen at slaughter will result in high ultimate pH (> 5. 7) carcases leading to <b>dark</b> <b>firm</b> <b>dry</b> (DFD) meat. However, in contradiction to this theory Martin el al. (2004) found more muscle glycogen in sheep selected for muscling. This was most evident when energy intake was high, implicating greater insulin sensitivity which may counteract the hypothesised greater adrenaline response. Therefore a link between selection for muscling and response to stress/adrenaline remains to be confirmed. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that selection for muscling will increase the muscle response to adrenaline...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the association of lung lesions with carcass and meat quality traits in slaughter pigs and to describe the main morphological features associated with lung lesions.

There were homozygous normal (NN), homozygous halothane positive (nn) and heterozygous (Nn) genotypes in both lnes. Cortisol was measured in the plasma of the blood samples and in muscle juice obtained by high-speed centrifugation. Meat quality was assessed using pH, colour, fibre-optic probe, drip loss and cure yield measurements.

40|$|Background: A {{recent study}} showed that niacin supplementation {{counteracts}} the obesity-induced muscle fiber switching from oxidative type I to glycolytic type II and increases the number of type I fibers in skeletal muscle of obese Zucker rats. These effects were likely mediated by the induction of key regulators of fiber transition, PGC-alpha and PGC-beta, leading to muscle fiber switching and up-regulation of genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid import and oxidation, citrate cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial biogenesis. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate whether niacin supplementation causes type II to type I muscle and changes the metabolic phenotype of skeletal muscles in growing pigs. Results: 25 male, 11 wk old crossbred pigs (Danzucht x Pietrain) with an average body weight of 32. 8 ± 1. 3 (mean ± SD) kg were randomly allocated to two groups of 12 (control group) and 13 pigs (niacin group) which were fed either a control diet or a diet supplemented with 750 mg niacin/kg diet. After 3 wk, the percentage number of type I fibers in three different muscles (M. longissismus dorsi, M. quadriceps femoris, M. gastrocnemius) was greater in the niacin group and the percentage number of type II fibers was lower in the niacin group than in the control group (P < 0. 05). The mRNA levels of PGC-beta and genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid catabolism (CACT, FATP 1, OCTN 2), citrate cycle (SDHA), oxidative phosphorylation (COX 4 / 1, COX 6 A 1), and thermogenesis (UCP 3) in M. longissimus dorsi were greater in the niacin group than in the control group (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: The study demonstrates that niacin supplementation induces type II to type I muscle fiber switching, and thereby an oxidative metabolic phenotype of skeletal muscle in pigs. Given that oxidative muscle types tend to develop <b>dark,</b> <b>firm</b> and <b>dry</b> pork in response to intense physical activity and/or high psychological stress levels preslaughter, a niacin-induced change in the muscle´s fiber type distribution may influence meat quality of pigs...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{determine}} the causes of spoilage and odorous compounds in two different lots of traditional Friuli sausages produced by two small-scale facilities in San Daniele del Friuli. In spoiled sausages the water activity (Aw) was higher than in unspoiled sausages (0. 94 vs. 0. 91). Moreover, the pH of the spoiled tested sausages remained high despite the presence of acidifying bacteria (6. 5 ± 0. 4 log CFU g - 1), such as lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and coagulase negative catalase positive cocci (CNCPC). Conversely, in unspoiled sausages the pH value was 5. 5 ± 0. 02. For this reason, the spoilage (mephitic type) {{can be attributed to the}} high pH (6. 3 ± 0. 2 units) of the pork meat used, which was classified as a <b>dark,</b> <b>firm,</b> <b>dry</b> type (DFD), to the high Aw, and to the activity of LAB, CNCPC cocci, and Enterobacteriaceae.

40|$|Research {{has been}} {{undertaken}} in which various methods for meat quality evaluation were compared. The measures used were pH (by homogenization and by combined electrode), light scattering conductivity, {{dielectric loss factor}} and colour. A very low incidence of PSE (Pale, Soft, Exudative) and DFD (<b>Dark,</b> <b>Firm,</b> <b>Dry)</b> cases was observed and the correlation between pH, as measured by homogenization and by combined electrode, {{did not appear to}} be completely satisfactory. Dielectric loss factor, as measured by the MS tester, seems to be specifically suited for PSE diagnosis. On the other hand, higher values of light scattering and conductivity measured at 24 h post mortem, are found to be linked to the rate of pH fall, even outside the range for PSE. Colour measurements, especially of the parameters L*, a* and hue angle, have given interesting information. In fact, meat could be classified by colour intensity (a*, psychometric chroma), by type of colour (hue angle) and by exudative phenomena (L*). No marked effects of rearing techniques have been observed, whereas the genetic background appears to influence some colour parameters. Slaughter conditions, on the other hand, could affect markedly all the meat quality parameters measured in this research...|$|E

The objective of this dissertation {{was to determine if}} functional ingredients, like hydrocolloids and bicarbonates, improved the quality of PSE and DFD meat. This was accomplished by examining the rheological characteristics of meat model systems and products after enhancement with hydrocolloids and bicarbonates ingredient solutions. These results will be used to formulate and manufacture either enhanced beef steaks, beef roasts, or frankfurters to test the efficacy of use {{to improve the quality of}} DFD or PSE meat. The flow behavior, steady-shear viscosity, and dynamic testing of hydrocolloid solutions were determined. Torsion Analysis (TA) and Texture Profile Analysis (TPA) were performed on PSE muscle tissue gel samples and frankfurters. Raw and cooked CIE color space values, pH, and sensory evaluation determination were made on meat gel samples, beef steaks, roast beef, and frankfurters. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (1. 0 %HPMC), methylcellulose (1. 0 %SGMC), and konjac flour (0. 125 %KF) were found to be Newtonian in behavior. The dynamic moduli of these ingredients were resistant to changes in ionic strength and were tested for viability in a meat model system. Potassium bicarbonate (KHCO) was a viable substitute for sodium bicarbonate. The synergistic effect of combining KHCO with hydrocolloids, salt and sodium phosphate (SP) improved the color, pH, and textural properties of PSE ground pork and frankfurters, but did not effect sensory characteristics. Acetic acid (AA), KF, and xanthan gum (XG) were added to beef steaks and bottom rounds {{to reduce the}} meat quality variation caused by high pH and animal age.

Animals were housed individually and were submitted to stressful ante mortem conditions (mixed in the lorry according to treatments and transported 1 h on rough roads). Individual feed intake was recorded during the 5 -day treatment. At the abattoir, pig behaviour was assessed in the raceway to the stunning system and during the stunning period by exposure to CO 2. Muscle pH, colour, water holding capacity, texture and cathepsin activities were determined to assess meat quality. The number of pigs with an individual feed intake lower than 2 kg/day was significantly different among diets (P 2 kg/day, all {{of them from the}} stress-sensitive pigs (nn). In general, no differences were observed in the behaviour of pigs along the corridor leading to the stunning system and inside the CO 2 stunning system. During the stunning procedure, Trp diet showed shorter periods of muscular excitation than control and Mg&Trp diets. The combination of a stressful ante mortem treatment and Mg&Trp supplementation led to carcasses with high incidence of severe skin lesions. Different meat quality results were found when considering all pigs or considering only those with adequate supplement intake. In this later case, Trp increased pH 45 (6. 15) vs Control diet (5. 96) in the Longissimus thoracis (LT) muscle (P< 0. 05) and pH at 24 h (Trp: 5. 59 vs C: 5. 47) led to a higher incidence of <b>dark,</b> <b>firm</b> and <b>dry</b> (DFD) traits in SM muscle (P< 0. 05).

It was also found that measuring the EV 24 hours post mortem is as informative as a pH sufficient for 24 hours after slaughter. This method was used to assess the influence of the length of pigs for slaughter and rest before slaughter on the occurrence of PSE defects, where the highest incidence of this defect occurred in slaughter pigs to transport distances of up to 20 km and rest prior to slaughter up to 2 hours. From the measurement results shows the suitability of this method to determine the quality parameters of beef directly in the slaughterhouse. The advantage of EV measurement method versus pH is easy to handle with the electrode, no propensity to mechanical damage and {{there is no need for}} frequent calibration of the electrode...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT An {{investigation}} {{was made into}} the effects of different lairage times and the position of chicken crates during transport to the slaughterhouse on the biochemical and hematological profile and physical parameters of broilers, such as color and pH of their breast meat. The treatments were defined by the animals slaughtered after 0, 2, 4 and 6 hours of lairage time at the slaughterhouse, transported in crates located in {{the top and bottom}} layers of the truck. It was found that increasing the lairage time at the slaughterhouse to over two hours reduced the number of lymphocytes and increased the heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio and the basophil count in the hemogram. In addition, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and cholesterol levels increased and plasma triglyceride and glucose levels decreased. The position of the crates in the truck altered the creatine kinase (CK) activity, and the highest enzyme activity was found in birds transported in the top layer of crates in the truck. Furthermore, the long lairage time in the slaughterhouse increased the pH and the value of a* (redness value) and decreased the lightness value of breast fillets. The interaction significant between 4 and 6 hours of lairage time and the position of the crate in the top layer of the truck favored the development of <b>dark,</b> <b>firm,</b> <b>dry</b> (DFD) meat...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to evaluate the effect of differences mammal temperament on muscle glycogen and lactate concentration. The temperament of 81 Angus steers was assessed seven times between weaning and yearling age using flight speed (m/s) and crush score (1 to 5) measurements. Muscle biopsy samples were collected four times from the semimembranosus (SM) and semitendinosus (ST) during the pasture finishing phase (around 18 to 24 months) and immediately after slaughter from each steer. Each biopsy was analysed for glycogen and lactate, and glycogen depletion due to pre-slaughter stress was calculated as the difference between on-farm glycogen and muscle glycogen at slaughter. An increase m flight speed from 0. 75 to 2. 25 m/s {{was associated with a}} reduction in muscle glycogen concentration by 8. 9 % (P< 0. 05) and an increase in muscle lactate concentration by 17. 3 % (P< 0. 01) m both the SM and ST. An increase in crush score from 1. 25 to 3 reduced muscle glycogen by I 0. 4 % (P< 0. 05) in the SM and ST and increased lactate in the ST by 42 % (P< 0. 05). Thus, animals with calm temperaments had higher resting glycogen concentration and mobilised less during stress compared to more excitable animals. However, the effect of temperament on glycogenolysis pre-slaughter or glycogen concentration at slaughter was not evident, most likely due to these animals becoming habituated to human contact. In conclusion it is likely that improved temperament will increase muscle glycogen concentration prior to slaughter and reduce the incidence of <b>dark,</b> <b>firm,</b> <b>dry</b> beef...|$|E

40|$|A reseach {{paper on}} the beef {{industry}} in Zimbabwe. The incidence of carcass bruising and occurrence of <b>dark,</b> <b>firm,</b> <b>dry</b> (DFD) beef in slaughter cattle were investigated from a survey of 9585 cattle delivered to a commercial abattoir. The objectives {{of the study were}} to evaluate the extent of occurrence of carcass bruising and DFD in slaughter cattle as these {{have a major impact on}} economic returns to the beef producer. In addition, these data can be used as indicators of either good or poor welfare of the animals prior to slaughter. In this study, the overall incidence of bruising was 29. 6 percent while that of DFD was 27. 4 percent. There were differences between the incidences of both bruising and DFD (p< 0. 001) in carcasses from bulls, steers and cows. Overall, bulls had the greatest carcass damage and steers the lowest. In addition, bruising increased (r = 0. 97; p< 0. 05) and the incidence of DFD also increased (r = 0. 94; p< 0. 05) with increasing transit distance. Linear regression analysis showed that a sixty kilometer increase in transit distance resulted in a seven percent increment in bruising (equation: y = 6. 9 + 7. 1 x; R 2 = 0. 96; p = 0. 0047). However, there was no association between bruising and DFD. Among different carcass weights, there was considerable variation in frequency of occurrence of DFD (p< 0. 001), with the proportion of carcasses showing DFD decreasing as carcass weight increased. The results indicate substantial compromised animal welfare and major economic loss to the entire livestock industry. Further, the results suggest that transit distance appears to contribute substantially to causes of bruising and DFD in slaughter cattle in Zimbabwe...|$|E
40|$|High-powered {{means of}} {{slaughter}} chickens production cause on certain individuals abnormal biochemical development of postmortal {{changes in their}} muscles. It consequently lead to interferences of sensory quality of the chicken meat. So called myopathies of the chicken breast meat occur in the low extent. It is typical variation in dark colouring of breast muscle. Veterinary supervision confiscates chickens embodying myopathy by reason of sensorical unacceptable dark muscle colour. Deepness of colour is evaluated by adspection of veterinary supervisors. It is tendency leading to find out objective parameters for evaluating this sensual chicken meat colour variation. Incidence of the chickens with myopathy has been evaluating for 3 years in big poultry slaughter, therewithal high-quality chickens and chickens with perspicuous myopathy have been taking out of slaughter-line. Electric conductivity values and pH values were measuring during 60 till 330 minutes post mortem in breast muscles. Aproximately 9 millions chicken was annually slaughtered and 13 thousands of them was confiscated out of the slaughter line by reason of myopathy. It amounts to 0. 14 per cent of annually count of processed chickens. Myopatical chickens had significantly higher muscle pH values as compared with healthy ones. Healthy chicken muscles decreased on ultimative pH values aproximately past 3 hours post mortem. It means pH 6. 03, and after 300 minutes decreased to pH 5. 82. However, myopatical chickens values varied from pH 6. 46 to pH 6. 30. Concurrently measured values of electric conductivity significantly corellated with pH values. Whereto, it's predication of similarity chicken myopathies and <b>dark,</b> <b>firm,</b> <b>dry</b> (DFD) pork or turkey meat.

40|$|Evaluation was {{undertaken}} of 144 carcasses at two abattoirs in the Manawatu region (New Zealand) to study pork quality characteristics. Surveys {{were made of}} farmers, transporters and abattoirs on how they handle the pigs before slaughter. Measurements were made of pH 1, pH u, colour (visual and Hunter LAB), water holding capacity (WHC) by filter paper press, drip loss and protein solubility of the Semitendinosus and Longissimus dorsi muscles. The pH 1 was measured at 45 minutes. After 24 hours storage in the chiller, the pH 24 and WHC were measured and after 30 minutes bloom, the colour measurements (Hunter L A B) and visual colour scores (0 = DFD, 1 = MDFD, 2 = normal, 3 = MPSE, 4 = PSE) were made. The protein solubility was measured within 48 hours postmortem and the drip loss was measured after 48 hours. The carcasses were subjectively classified as DFD (<b>dark,</b> <b>firm,</b> <b>dry),</b> MDFD (mild DFD), normal, MPSE (mild PSE) and PSE (pale, soft, exudative). Sex, breed, age, transport time, distance, last feeding time, weather condition, bruises and laceration/scratches, and stunning time were also recorded. The total incidence of PSEo was 41. 98 % in the ST and 72. 41 % in the LD, and the DFDo incidence was 10. 65 % in the LD and 36. 05 % in the ST. Almost all the meat quality traits were highly correlated (r = 0. 35 to 0. 92) and highly significant (p < 0. 001) {{with each other in}} both muscles used. pH (pH 1 and pH 24) was the most dependable technique used in this study. There is no obvious relationship between occurrence of pork quality problem in the pigs and the lairage period or transport distance. However, sex had low but significant correlations with pH 1 suggesting a possible advantage in treating sexes differently after they leave the farm...|$|E
