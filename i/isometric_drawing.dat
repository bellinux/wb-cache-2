40|$|To {{investigate}} the thinning {{of the whole}} crust, and {{the contribution of the}} upper versus lower crust to the stretching since Cenozoic, we calculated the stretching factor of the northern margin of South China Sea with data such as whole crustal thickness, depth of Cenozoic sedimentary basement and the horizontal displacement of faults. An <b>isometric</b> line <b>drawing</b> on whole crustal stretching factor is then obtained. Along the seismic Line 1530 in Baiyun sag, we also calculated the stretching factors of the upper and lower crust. The results suggest that the whole crustal thickness decreases seaward while the whole crustal stretching factor increases from shelf to slope. The Moho upwells highest beneath where the crust is thinned most. The value of the whole crustal stretching factor ranges from 1. 5 to 6. Two areas were thinned intensely: the center of Yinggehai Basin, and the Baiyun sag in the Pearl River Mouth Basin. The calculation of the upper and lower crustal stretching factors from DSP 1530 in Baiyun sag shows that the original crust of Baiyun sag should be thinned before deformation. Its pre-Cenozoic evolution as well as tectonic position during Cenozoic might be responsible for that...|$|R
5000|$|Pixel art is {{commonly}} divided in two subcategories: isometric and non-isometric.The <b>isometric</b> kind is <b>drawn</b> in a near-isometric dimetric projection. This {{is commonly}} seen in games {{to provide a}} three-dimensional view without using any real three-dimensional processing. Technically, an isometric angle would be of 30 degrees from the horizontal, but this is avoided since the pixels created by a line drawing algorithm would not follow a neat pattern. To fix this, lines with a 1:2 pixel ratio are picked, leading to an angle of about 26.57 degrees (arctan 0.5). One subcategory is planometric, which is done at a 1:1 angle, giving a more top-down look. Another subcategory is [...] "rpg perspective", in which the x and z (vertical) axes are combined into a side/top view. This view is facing an edge, instead of a vertex.|$|R
40|$|Engineering {{drawing is}} a {{combination}} of geometrical and building, mechanical and electrical drawing. It relates between theory and picture of reality. Engineering drawing will provide an accurate and complete picture for every object in terms of shape and size. Individuals involved in the world of engineering must be able to read and interpret an engineering drawing. This is an important pre-requisite. Many researches showed that those who learn Engineering drawing encounter difficulties to see an image in 3 dimension, in other words, visualisation. In Engineering drawing, information and specifications from the real object must be transferred to a drawing; likewise, interpretation of information from a drawing to produce a real image. The transfer from reality to a drawing and vice versa is not an easy task. Thus, a web-based system for teaching and learning Engineering drawing was developed based on the Visualisation and Constructivist Model. EEO™ is tailored for several topics of engineering drawing such as Orthographic Projection; Sectional View; <b>Isometric</b> and Oblique <b>drawing</b> at the secondary level. The learning strategy consists of multiple phases beginning with orientation, elicitation of ideas, reconstruction, application of concept and reflection. For example, in the orientation phase, students will be exposed to an overview of the topic followed by learning of specific concepts. Other phase involved eliciting of ideas reconstruction of concept and application of knowledge. This system also provides a learning environment that allows learners to view objects from different angles; such as third angle projection and first angle projection as well as views of plans, side and front elevations. The learners will be gUided through the various steps in drawing methods for each topic via animations and simulations. Learners are able to view any section repeatedly. Examples of real application of engineering drawings WIJl be also given using graphic, animations and video. To evaluate students understanding, exercises will be given {{at the end of each}} session. The effectiveness of the system will also be evaluated using students' interactive patterns while working at the interface...|$|R

40|$|Spatial {{visualization}} is {{a fundamental}} skill in technical graphics and engineering designs. From conventional multiview drawing to modern solid modeling using computer-aided design, visualization skills have always been essential for representing three-dimensional objects and assemblies. Researchers have developed various types of tests to measure students ’ spatial visualization abilities, in which most pictorial views of three-dimensional objects are represented by isometric drawings. Isometric drawings have many advantages such as being simple to draw, and equally representing the front, top, and side surfaces. However, they are also susceptible to drawing mistakes {{in spite of their}} relatively simple construction. This paper discusses the typical styles of visualization tests designed for engineering and technology students. Three formats for spatial visualization tests (developments, rotations, and isometric views) are compared through the students ’ performance at a community college. A popular spatial visualization test is used as example to show some mistakes in its isometric drawings. Recommendations are made to improve <b>isometric</b> <b>drawing</b> in spatial visualization tests...|$|E

40|$|Spatial {{visualization}} {{skills are}} essential in many {{engineering and technology}} fields. These skills are especially important in hand sketching and computer-aided design (CAD) of engineering graphics, when {{it is necessary to}} visualize and represent three-dimensional (3 D) objects and assemblies. Educators and researchers have developed various types of tests to assess students’ abilities in spatial visualization tasks. Conventional visualization tests usually use axonometric drawings, mostly isometric projections, to represent 3 D objects. However, isometric drawings are dimensionally distorted and lack many features present in a realistic view of 3 D objects. They are also prone to drawing errors, which, when combined with the inherent distortions of <b>isometric</b> <b>drawing,</b> may lead to misjudgment of students ’ visualization abilities. In order to accurately assess students ’ visualization ability, realistic views are necessary in spatial visualization tests. To investigate the effects of 3 D views, the author conducted a comparative study of a popular spatial visualization test given to the first-year graphics and CAD classes at a minority community college. The objects in the Purdue Spatial Visualization Test – Visualization by Rotations (PSVT-R) were recreated with 3 D solid modeling CAD software t...|$|E
40|$|Methods are {{developed}} and defined for obtaining numerical solutions to three-dimensional, free surface, invisvid, incompressible fluid flows and three-dimensional free surface Darcian flow in porous media. Since those boundaries consisting of free surface are unknown a priori, {{a solution to}} the space boundary value problem resulting from a formulation in the physical space is very difficult, if not impossible, to obtain. Consequently, the methods described herein are based on a formulation in a space defined by a potential function and two mutually orthogonal stream surfaces whose intersections define the streamlines of the flow. In this space the positions of free surfaces are known. The formulation considers the magnitudes of the Cartesian coordinates x,y, and z as the dependent variables. The applicability of the methods are demonstrated by implementing them in a computer program and by obtaining solutions to four problems with slightly different geometries of three-dimensional Darvian seepage flow of water through a dam with a drain over only a portion of the toe. <b>Isometric</b> <b>drawing</b> of the space flownets display the results from these solutions. Also a number of regular flownets are given which were constructed by projecting the points of intersection of the two stream surfaces and/or equipotential surfaces onto horizontal or vertical planes...|$|E
40|$|Within {{industrial}} construction, piping can constitute up to 50 % of {{the cost}} of a typical project. It has been shown that across the activities involved in pipe fabrication, pipe fitting has the highest impact on the critical path. The pipe fitter is responsible for interpreting the <b>isometric</b> <b>drawing</b> and then performing the tack welds on piping components so that the assembly complies with the design. Three main problems in doing this task are identified as: (1) reading and interpreting the <b>isometric</b> <b>drawing</b> is challenging and error prone for spatially complicated assemblies, (2) in assemblies with tight allowable tolerance, a number of iterations will take place to fit the pipes with compliance to the design. These iterations (rework) will remain unrecorded in the production process, and (3) no continuous measurement tool exists to let the fitter check his/her work in progress against the design information and acceptance specifications. Addressing these problems could substantially improve pipe fitters’ productivity. The objective of this research is to develop a software package integrating a threefold solution to simplify complex tasks involved in pipe fabrication: (1) making design information easier to understand, {{with the use of a}} tablet, 3 D imaging device and an application software, (2) providing visual feedback on the correctness of fabrication between the design intent and the as-built state, and (3) providing frequent feedback on fabrication using a step-by-step assembly and control framework. The step-by-step framework will reduce the number of required iterations for the pipe fitter. A number of challenges were encountered in order to provide a framework to make real time, visual and frequent feedback. For frequent and visual feedback, a real time 3 D data acquisition tool with an acceptable level of accuracy should be adopted. This is due to the speed of fabrication in an industrial facility. The second challenge is to find the object of interest in real time, once a point cloud is acquired, and finally, once the object is found, to optimally remove points that are considered as clutter to improve the visual feedback for the pipe fitters. To address the requirement for a reliable and real time acquisition tool, Chapter 3 explores the capabilities and limitations of low cost range cameras. A commercially available 3 D imaging tool was utilized to measure its performance for real time point cloud acquisition. The device was used to inspect two pipe spools altered in size. The acquired point clouds were super-imposed on the BIM (Building Information Model) model of the pipe spools to measure the accuracy of the device. Chapter 4 adapts and examines a real time and automatic object finding algorithm to measure its performance with respect to construction challenges. Then, a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm was employed to classify points as being clutter or corresponding to the object of interest. Chapter 5 investigates the effect of the threshold value “K” in the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm and optimizing its value for an improved visual feedback. As a result of the work described in this thesis, along with the work of two other master students and a co-op student, a software package was designed and developed. The software package takes advantage of the investigated real time point cloud acquisition device. While the object finding algorithm proved to be effective, a 3 -point matching algorithm was used, as it was more intuitive for the users and took less time. The KNN algorithm was utilized to remove clutter points to provide more accurate visual feedback more accurate to the workers...|$|E

DSME is {{trying to set up}} a flexible design and construction environment for shipbuilding and offshore construction in a single shipyard. The shipbuilding and offshore projects, however, have their unique technology but they need to be designed and constructed in one site. To support this new requirement, DSME has developed an integrated CAD system for ship and offshore projects. In this integrated design environment, the designers can design commercial ships and offshore projects in a flexible manner. Concurrent design is very important for ship and offshore design. As compared to the complexity of the product, the design period is quite short. In effect, the design system for the ship and offshore project has to support concurrent design. One essential point of concurrent design environment is a product model based design system. DSME has developed and implemented the 3 D product model concurrent design environment based on Tribon M 3. Tribon is a widely used CAD system in shipbuilding area that is developed by Tribon Solutions. DSME has both customized the Tribon system and developed in-house application systems to support its own design and production procedures. All the design objects are modeled in one common database to support concurrent design and accurate production. The major in-house development focused on the modeling automation and automatic drawing generation. During the drawing generation process many of the additional production information are also extracted from the 3 D product model. In addition, several applications and functionalities have been developed to apply the shipbuilding based Tribon M 3 system to offshore projects.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} feasibility of web technology {{as a means of}} handling service requests for delivering high quality service in building operation and maintenance. This research proposes a web-based graphic service request (WGSR) system as a pragmatic solution to the limitations of current computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) processes. Service request process in CMMS was developed as text-based, so that it is hard for ordinary tenants to use. Therefore, when tenants have a problem in a facility, they prefer calling in service requests or going to the office instead of using the internet service request application. In practice, work orders and records are often misplaced - resulting in lower efficiency and customer satisfaction. This may be overcome by a system that states information digitally and provides a web-based Graphic Service Request (WGSR) interface. The interface allow customers to report environmental problems in the facility, trace their work order progress, view schedules for maintenance, and provide feedback for service online. The WGSR system is an end-user point-and-click graphical interface that allows residents to request service by selecting a problem fixture on a floor plan image. By using HTML image map tags and combination of location, part, and types of problem identification number, the resident's input produces a text-based problem report for Facility Management (FM) departments that allows them to service requests on the fly. To solve the complexity and inefficiency issues of CMMS, the user interface for the WGRS system consists of a perspective drawing or <b>isometric</b> <b>drawing</b> of each unit's plan. An empirical test of the system and post-task survey was conducted to determine the efficiency and usefulness of the system. The analysis of the results shows the system to be efficient and convenient in several fields, including comprehensibility, navigability, simplicity, clarity, compatibility, and graphic appeal. This result shows that residents prefer to use the WGSR system and could reduce the effort needed to make and receive service request phone calls and input information into a database. The labor and time for daily work could be saved to recognize problems correctly and set the right schedule so that this could be used for preventive work and project work...|$|E
