2500|$|National {{emission}} targets {{specified in}} the Kyoto Protocol exclude international aviation and shipping. Kyoto Parties can use land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF) in meeting their targets. [...] LULUCF activities are also called [...] "sink" [...] activities. Changes in sinks and land use can {{have an effect on}} the climate, and indeed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Special Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry estimates that since 1750 a third of <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> caused by land use change. Particular criteria apply to the definition of forestry under the Kyoto Protocol.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{climate change}} is {{estimated}} to have more serious effects on wildlife {{over the next few}} decades, there is evidence that sea turtles have already been affected. [...] With the increase of temperature, polar ice has melted and has led to the rise of sea levels. [...] This rise in sea levels has been a factor in the loss of beach, which for sea turtles means less nesting area. [...] <b>Global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> associated with severe weather, which could mean harsh and numerous storms that erode beaches and flood nests. [...] As the overall temperature of the earth rises, so does the temperature of the sand, which diminishes the rate of hatchling survival. [...] The temperature of the sand also affects gender, as higher temperatures have been shown to yield more female hatchlings. [...] Changes in climate also influence currents and change the number and location of prey species. [...] Water that is too warm can also cause coral bleaching, which is detrimental to reefs that are essential to certain species, such as the Hawksbill sea turtle.|$|E

50|$|A {{global warming}} {{conspiracy}} theory invokes claims that scientific consensus {{on global warming}} is based on conspiracies to produce false data or suppress dissent. It {{is one of a}} number of tactics used in climate change denial to legitimize political and public controversy disputing this consensus.Global warming conspiracy theorists typically allege that, through worldwide acts of professional and criminal misconduct, the science behind <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> invented or distorted for ideological or financial reasons, or both.|$|E
5000|$|Stephens accepts that human-caused <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> occurring, but {{denies that}} the change {{constitutes}} a threat and mocks climate change activism [...] "as hysterical alarmism" [...] that distracts the public from issues he considers more important such as terrorism. He argues that global warming activism is based on theological beliefs rather than science, as an outgrowth of western tendencies to expect punishment for sins.He has also suggested that climate change activists would be more persuasive if they were less sure of their beliefs.|$|E

5000|$|On a {{range of}} health issues, Booker has put forward a view {{that the public is}} being {{unnecessarily}} [...] "scared", as detailed in his book Scared to Death. Thus he argues that asbestos, passive smoking and BSE <b>have</b> not <b>been</b> shown to be dangerous. His views on these matters go against scientific consensus, and as a result have attracted much criticism from other journalists as well as public bodies. Thus his articles on asbestos and on <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> repeatedly challenged by George Monbiot of The Guardian, and the UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has repeatedly refuted his claims about asbestos.|$|R

Migration to avoid <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> highly controversial because many of the fossils that are found in this region are juvenile and of small body size.|$|E
5000|$|Recent NASA {{research}} has confirmed the vital role of enteric fermentation in livestock on global warming. [...] "We understand that other greenhouse gases apart from carbon dioxide {{are important for}} climate change today," [...] said Gavin Schmidt, the lead author {{of the study and}} a researcher at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, NY and Columbia University's Center for Climate Systems Research.

5000|$|Development {{of a joint}} {{declaration}} on efforts to tackle <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> much less successful, principally because of the long-standing U.S. opposition to emission targets {{as a solution to}} global warming.

5000|$|The {{efforts of}} Al Gore and other {{environmental}} campaigns {{have focused on the}} effects of global warming and have managed to increase awareness and concern, but despite these efforts as of 2007, the number of Americans believing humans are the cause of global warming was holding steady at 61%, and those believing the popular media was understating the issue remained about 35%. [...] Between 2010 and 2013, the number of Americans who believe the media under-reports the seriousness of <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> increasing, and the number who think media over-states it has been falling. According to a 2013 Gallup US opinion poll, 57% believe global warming is at least as bad as portrayed in the media (with 33% thinking media has downplayed global warming and 24% saying coverage is accurate). Less than half of Americans (41%) think the problem is not as bad as media portrays it.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{provides}} a historical {{overview of the}} role of North–South differences in expectation and priorities in determining how international negotiations about <b>global</b> <b>warming</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> framed and implemented. Our analysis looks at two themes: the problem of technology transfer and knowledge inequity and the persistence of the G- 77 as the point of departure for Southern action within the context of environmental negotiations. Our argument is that the North and South remain divided on the consequences of linking environment and development for future policy on conserving the global commons. In particular, the problem of accepting the burden of readjustment appears to be politically unacceptable to both North and South...|$|R
