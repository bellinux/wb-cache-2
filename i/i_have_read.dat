5|$|As {{you long}} ago wrote me, {{and told me}} personally, nay predicted, Jackson has thrown me overboard; he is not only unwilling to give me employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has in every single instance refused office to my friends, and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others. Nor does he stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and my friends in Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>read</b> those folks at Washington thoroughly... I am not of a temper to pocket insult, neglect, or injury. I have, my dear friend, determined on my course. I can be as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors, and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet, but when the day of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. You must know that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. Then I will begin to formulate a message in which, as you know, my own principles will be maintained.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>read</b> your {{official}} {{letter with}} all the attention such a recital merits; but until the Board receive official information of the force, and the nation to which the vessel belongs, which the Sylph was engaged with, and adequate judgement cannot be formed of {{the merits of the}} action.|$|E
25|$|My dear Miss Hamilton, What can I have to say? Not much indeed! But to {{wish you}} a good morning, in the pretty blue and white room where I had the {{pleasure}} to sit and read with you The Hermit, a poem which is such a favourite with me that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>read</b> it twice this summer. Oh! What a blessing to keep good company! Very likely I {{should not have been}} acquainted with either poet or poem was it not for you.|$|E
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> the correspondence, {{we spoke}} again of Cristel.|$|R
60|$|I {{answered}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> ROBINSON CRUSOE when I was a child.|$|R
60|$|I am used to {{thinking}} quickly, {{and by the}} time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> this <b>I</b> <b>had</b> an idea.|$|R
500|$|In 1958, Achebe {{sent his}} novel to the agent {{recommended}} by Gilbert Phelps in London. It {{was sent to}} several publishing houses; some rejected it immediately, claiming that fiction from African writers had no market potential. Finally it reached the office of Heinemann, where executives hesitated until an educational adviser, Donald MacRae, just back in England after a trip through West Africa, read the book and forced the company's hand with his succinct report: [...] "This is the best novel <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>read</b> since the war".|$|E
500|$|At a {{press conference}} on Sept 14 1937, Roosevelt was asked about whether he had {{knowledge}} of Black's involvement with the Ku Klux Klan. He responded in part, “I know only what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>read</b> in the newspapers…Mr. Justice Black is abroad. Until such time as he returns there is no further comment to be made.” On Sept 21 1937, FDR was again asked during {{a press conference}} {{about whether or not}} he had communications with Hugo Black regarding his involvement in the Ku Klux Klan. Again, FDR denied speaking with Hugo Black, and when asked about whether the Department of Justice should be [...] "charged automatically" [...] with investigating Supreme Court appointments, FDR said in part, [...] "No, certainly not...a man's private life is supposed to be his private life..." ...|$|E
500|$|.....of [...] that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>read,</b> the {{negative}} ones often {{say something to}} the effect that the book is just like the game, so why read it? What those readers may not realize is that I was hired to novelize the game. That means taking the game and turning it into a book [...] or, put another way, I did what I was hired to do. ...there must be some folks who feel that I wrote the Chief out of character. That's news to me. All I {{can tell you is that}} the Bungie folks, who care deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue, and approved the book as written. However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E
2500|$|So I {{sat down}} and did a huge list of {{everything}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> ... and when <b>I</b> finished the list I handed it to them [...] They said that's impossible, you couldn't read that many books in a year, two years, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> all of those books in {{two and a half}} weeks - and well, that's The Secret.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> of Caddy in Ada's letters, {{but not of}} Richard. I {{told him}} so.|$|R
60|$|Secondly: the {{disappearance}} of Van Huyn's book when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> up to {{the description of the}} Star Ruby.|$|R
500|$|Thomas Sowell, a pundit {{and social}} critic, {{described}} it as [...] "brilliant and insightful" [...] in Capitalism magazine and [...] "an insightful and devastating eyewitness account of the white underclass in Britain" [...] in the Jewish World Review. Overall, Sowell said that the collection was able to explain that [...] "One of the most telling examples of the social destructiveness of the left's welfare-state vision can be found among the white slum dwellers in Britain." [...] Atlanta Journal-Constitution writer, Theresa K. Weaver, called the collection [...] "saddening, infuriating, and ultimately not terribly empowering", stating that she wishes Dalrymple [...] "might at least offer a few ideas on turning everything around." [...] Arthur Foulkes of the Carolina Journal {{described it as}} a [...] "fine book" [...] that [...] "offers much to friends of liberty everywhere." [...] Roger Donway of The Atlas Society considered it to be [...] "one of the most instructive books that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>read</b> in many years". Stephen Goode, writing for Insight on the News, said that the collection argued its [...] "position brilliantly and with impressive passion". The National Observer wrote that it [...] "has much value", if it is taken as an [...] "antidote to fashionable loose thinking".|$|E
2500|$|In 1954, church apostle Mark E. Petersen: [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>read</b> {{enough to}} give you an idea of what the Negro is after. He is not just seeking the {{opportunity}} of sitting down in a cafe where white people eat. He isn't just trying to ride on the same streetcar or the same Pullman car with white people. It isn't that he just desires to go to the same theater as the white people. From this, and other interviews <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>read,</b> it appears that the Negro seeks absorption with the white race. He will not be satisfied until he achieves it by intermarriage. That is his objective and we must face it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another witness {{testified that}} [...] "I don't think the term 'fruit' or the term 'vegetables' had, in March 1883, and prior thereto, any special meaning in trade and {{commerce}} {{in this country}} different from that which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>read</b> here from the dictionaries." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{told him}} no, and {{explained}} {{how it was}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> it, {{and all those other}} books of which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> made mention.|$|R
60|$|Towards evening, the Duke of Losas passed my hotel, and, {{seeing me}} at the door, asked if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> the manuscript.|$|R
25|$|These tenses (except for present perfect) {{correspond}} roughly to equivalent English perfect tenses (<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> / <b>I</b> will <b>have</b> <b>read).</b> They {{are used}} in various contexts for very different meanings, but they usually indicate an action that happened before another action said with another verb, noun or similar: Tos knygos neėmiau, nes jau ją buvau skaitęs – I didn’t take that book because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> already <b>read</b> it; Po kelionės vaikai bus labai pasiilgę tėvų – After the trip the children will have badly missed their parents.|$|R
2500|$|... "It {{has been}} a long time since <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>read</b> {{anything}} from the pen of any man which has given me such encouragement as your article has. [...] In a speech on Lincoln's Birthday which I am to deliver in New York, I am going to take the liberty to quote liberally from what you have said." ...|$|E
2500|$|Antony Hecht :"It is {{as deeply}} spiritual a poem as any <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>read</b> in modern times, not {{excluding}} Eliot’s Four Quartets, or {{anything to be}} found in the works of professional religionists. It is an incomparable triumph. Be immediately assured that this does not mean devoid of humor, or without a rich sense of comedy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gentlemen, I am {{sure you}} have heard of a ridiculous ass that ... wrote an absurd Astrological Discourse ... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>read</b> over thy sheepish {{discourse}} of The Lamb Of God And His Enemies, and ... I could not refrain, but bequeath it to the privy, leaf by leaf as I read it, it was so ugly, dorbellical, and lumpish.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you <b>had</b> {{said that}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> it {{a hundred and}} fifty times," [...] {{returned}} Lumley, [...] "you would have been still under the mark." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> Goldsmith's History of Rome, and {{had formed}} my opinion of Nero, Caligula, &c. Also <b>I</b> <b>had</b> drawn {{parallels}} in silence, which I never thought thus to have declared aloud.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> sense {{enough not}} to quote the next two lines, because when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> them to Jone {{he said that it}} was a shame to use a horse that way.|$|R
2500|$|The B. C. Catholic {{wrote that}} the {{chapters}} on Saint Francis and Mother Teresa most compellingly show Easwaran's [...] "special fondness for {{people who suffer from}} material and spiritual poverty and especially from a lack of love.... His meditation on St. Francis' Prayer... is the most inspiring <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>read,</b> especially as Easwaran illustrates it with anecdotes from his own life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Flavius Philostratus {{recalled}} {{one of his}} anecdotes: [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>read</b> in {{the discourse}} of Juba that elephants assist one another when they are being hunted, {{and that they will}} defend one that is exhausted, and if they can remove him out of danger, they anoint his wounds with the tears of the aloe tree, standing round him like physicians." ...|$|E
2500|$|I have no {{knowledge}} of either Sanscrit or Arabic. But I have done what I could to form a correct estimate of their value. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>read</b> translations of the most celebrated Arabic and Sanscrit works. I have conversed both here and at home with men distinguished by their proficiency in the Eastern tongues. I am quite ready to take the Oriental learning at the valuation of the Orientalists ...|$|E
6000|$|Tatler.--"I {{have not}} felt {{so full of}} eagerness and life since the [...] war began as after <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> this delightfully humorous and clever [...] book." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Before <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> to him {{for more}} than half an hour he was fast asleep. Not feeling that way inclined, I went on reading to myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "For five lang years, {{and five}} lang years, I coorted thee by looks; By nods and winks, by smiles and tears, As <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> in books.|$|R
2500|$|One {{edition of}} the book has a quote from a review in the Los Angeles Times on the front cover stating: [...] "A fascinating, {{frightening}} book... the scariest true story <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>read</b> in years", while the tagline states: [...] "More hideously frightening than The Exorcist because it actually happened!" [...] The reference to The Exorcist is revealing, because the 1973 film had been a box office success and had received generous media coverage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{results of}} the inquest were {{released}} on 12 December 2000, NSW coroner John Abernethy finding that the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia had [...] "abdicated its responsibility to manage the race". He wrote: [...] "From what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>read</b> and heard, {{it is clear to}} me that during this crucial time the race management team played the role of observers rather than managers and that was simply not good enough." [...] But he acknowledged the club's actions to upgrade safety precautions and sailor qualifications.|$|E
2500|$|When Andrew Marr asked Corbyn [...] "do you regard {{yourself}} as a Marxist?", Corbyn responded by saying: [...] "That {{is a very interesting}} question actually. I haven't thought about that for a long time. I haven't really read as much of Marx as we should have done. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>read</b> quite a bit but not that much." [...] Similarly, defending John McDonnell's statement that there is [...] "a lot to learn" [...] from Karl Marx's book Das Kapital, Corbyn described Marx as a [...] "great economist".|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> {{somewhere that}} among the novelist's {{greatest}} difficulties is that of sustaining his own interest in a novel day by day until it is finished.|$|R
60|$|Before <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> half-way through it, {{he began}} to dictate, {{speaking}} so rapidly that my pen was not always able to follow him. My handwriting is as bad as bad can be when I am hurried. To make matters worse still, I was confused. What he was now saying seemed to {{have nothing to do}} with what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been <b>reading.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Body of God!" [...] {{he swore}} aloud, [...] "it is well that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> it a dozen times. Better {{that it should}} have been burnt than that someone should <b>have</b> <b>read</b> it whilst <b>I</b> slept." ...|$|R
