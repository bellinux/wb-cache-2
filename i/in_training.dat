5|$|Among {{the most}} popular {{activities}} for an Australian Cattle Dog is dog agility. It is ideally suited for navigating obstacle courses, since as a herding dog it is reactive to the handler's body language and willing to work accurately {{at a distance from}} the handler. Agility has been used by Cattle Dog owners to instil confidence in their dogs, and enhance their performance <b>in</b> <b>training</b> and competition.|$|E

5|$|Back in {{its former}} base in Egypt {{and with its}} ranks {{restored}} with 400 reinforcements that arrived in June, the battalion began intensive weapons training.

40|$|Fatty acids {{are known}} to {{decrease}} insulin-mediated glucose utilization in humans, both at rest and during exercise. To evaluate the effect of endurance <b>training</b> <b>in</b> this process, we infused lipids or saline in groups of sedentary and highly trained subjects. Whole body glucose utilization and substrate oxidation were monitored during a 2. 5 -h hyperinsulinemic clamp. During the last 30 min, a cycling exercise was superimposed. During hyperinsulinemia at rest, whole body glucose utilization and glucose oxidation were higher <b>in</b> <b>trained</b> subjects than <b>in</b> sedentary subjects. Compared with the control experiments with the antilipolytic agent acipimox, lipid infusion stimulated lipid oxidation {{to the same extent}} <b>in</b> <b>trained</b> as <b>in</b> sedentary subjects. It reduced whole body glucose utilization by 37 % <b>in</b> <b>trained</b> and by 41 % in sedentary subjects. During exercise, lipid infusion increased more lipid oxidation <b>in</b> <b>trained</b> than <b>in</b> sedentary subjects and reduced whole body glucose utilization by 43 +/- 4 % <b>in</b> <b>trained</b> and by 22 +/- 4 % in sedentary subjects (P < 0. 01). The present data indicate that lipid infusion has similar effects on lipid oxidation and whole body glucose utilization during hyperinsulinemia at rest <b>in</b> <b>trained</b> and sedentary subjects. During exercise, however, it increases more lipid oxidation and produces a more important reduction in glucose utilization <b>in</b> <b>trained</b> than <b>in</b> sedentary subjects. These results suggest that endurance training enhances the inhibitory effect of lipids on whole body glucose metabolism during exercise...|$|R
