40|$|International audienceObjectives: In eye banks, {{endothelial cell}} density (number of endothelial cells per surface unit, ECD) {{is the main}} {{criterion}} to validate the quality of corneal grafts. Stored corneas present numerous deep endothelial folds. Consequently only few endothelial areas are parallel to the microscope and parallax errors inevitably lead to overestimating ECD. Aim: to present an innovative method of ECs count on the reconstructed 3 D topography of the endothelium. Materials and methods: Stacks of endothelial images were acquired using a Z motorized conventional transmitted light microscope. A depth map was obtained by researching maximized measurements of the focus in images (shape-from-focus method). Texture of the surface was built by summing image parts presenting the right focus leading to an all-in-focus image. By calculating first derivative in all directions of depth map, precise estimation of cells in folds surfaces could be found. Accuracy of slope detection was verified using artificial endothelial mosaics micro printed on a glass slide with known ECD. Slides were tilted with an angle of 20 ° and 45 °. Gain in accuracy was calculated using human organ cultured donor corneas. For each cornea, the new 3 D count was compared with the conventional 2 D count of the same area as usually performed in eye banks. The mean difference between both counts and its 95 % confidence interval was calculated. Results: The 3 D reconstruction eliminated the areas that were usually blurred and therefore {{increased the number of}} visible cells that could be counted in each field. The 3 D reconstruction algorithms precisely detected the local slopes. The conventional 2 D counts overestimated the ECD by a mean 8. 5 % 95 %CI(5. 5 – 11. 5), because of parallax error. Conclusion: The 3 D endothelial cell counting is ready to be integrated in <b>eye-banks</b> in order to improve the accuracy of endothelial quality controls...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{written by}} Anders Kvalheim, on the report: Effects of Organ Culture and Optisol-GS Storage on Structural Integrity, Phenotypes, and Apoptosis in Cultured Corneal Epithelium. Purpose of report: In this study, {{conventional}} organ culture (OC) storage and Optisol-GS storage of cultured human limbal epithelial cells (HLEC) are compared at different temperatures to find optimal conditions to store cultured tissue prior to transplantation to treat limbal stem cell deficiency. Finding {{the best possible}} way to store the HLECs, will benefit: Flexibility when planning transplantations, making it possible to perform microbiological testing, and safe transportation that will make operations possible not only at the sites of the few laboratories and <b>eye-banks</b> that perform the ex-vivo expansion of the HLECs. Methods: HLECs cultured for three weeks, were stored in OC at 31 °C or at 23 °C, and in Optisol-GS at 5 °C. All were stored in a closed container for 1 week. Morphology was studied by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Phenotypic characterization was done by immunohistochemistry. Apoptosis was evaluated by three different methods: 1) Real-time RT-PCR microarray analysis. 2) Caspase- 3 immunohistochemistry. 3) Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL). Results: At 23 °C the ultrastructure was maintained, but at both 5 °C and 31 °C the structure was changed. Detachment of epithelial cells, enlarged intercellular spaces and intracellular vacuoles, and separation of desmosomes were all seen at these temperatures. All cultured HLECs remained undifferentiated throughout all storage conditions. Caspase- 3 and TUNEL staining did not show any significant increase under storage. Downregulation of BCL 2 A 1, BIRC 1, and TNF and upregulation of CARD 6 under 23 ºC and 5 ºC storage conditions suggested a reduction in nuclear factor- B activity. This finding is particular interesting as it may lessen the need for immunosuppression subsequent to storage. Conclusion: Apoptosis is minimal after OC storage. The article shows that storage of HLECs at the unconventional storage temperature of 23 °C is superior to 31 °C OC and at 5 °C Optisol-GS...|$|R

40|$|In {{the cornea}} {{of the eye}} light {{transmission}} is facilitated by the regular arrangement and uniform diameter of collagen fibrils that constitute {{the bulk of the}} extracellular corneal matrix. Matrix architecture, in turn, is believed to be governed by interactions between collagen fibrils and proteoglycan molecules modified with sulfated glycosaminoglycan side chains. Here, we outline the contribution made by small-angle X-ray scattering studies of the cornea in understanding the role of sulfated glycosaminoglycans in the control of collagen architecture in cornea, and present new depth-profiled microbeam data from swollen human <b>eye-bank</b> corneas that indicate no significant change in collagen fibril diameter throughout the tissue, but a lower collagen interfibrillar spacing in the anterior-most stromal regions compared with the ultrastructure of the deeper cornea...|$|E
40|$|Corpuscular {{nerve endings}} {{were found to}} be {{numerous}} within a narrow, 1. 00 mm wide, annular zone of limbal conjunctiva, located approximately 0. 5 mm from the corneoscleral margin. A light and electron microscopic study was carried out on these nerve endings found within samples of human <b>eye-bank</b> material. Corpuscular endings were found immediately under the epithelium, often within the stromal elevations which make up the limbal palisades of Vogt. They were round to oval in shape, and varied in size, with a mean maximum diameter of 30 microns. The afferent nerve fibre lost its myelin sheath soon after entry, and subsequently branched to give rise to a variable number of axon terminal varicosities, which were characterised by an accumulation of mitochondria. Neural elements within the nerve ending were invested by the cytoplasmic lamellae of Schwann-like accessory cells. The corpuscle was demarcated from the surrounding connective tissue by a delicate fibrocyte capsule. The corpuscular nerve endings described here in the conjunctiva share features common to corpuscles found in other mucosae. The function of such complex sensory nerve endings is as yet unknown, but the possibility that they represent receptors for particular sensory modalities should be explored...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: An {{increasing}} number of cases are being recognized in which a peribulbar anesthetic for cataract surgery has been inadvertently injected directly into the globe under high pressure until the globe ruptures or explodes. We reviewed the records of 6 such cases (one of which was reported previously by us), and one additional case {{has been reported in}} the literature. Surprisingly, 2 of these 7 cases went unrecognized at the time, and the surgeons proceeded with the cataract operation; all of the patients ultimately developed severe visual loss and/or loss of the eye. OBJECTIVES: To reproduce this eye explosion in a live anesthetized rabbit model and to perform a clinical, histopathological, experimental, biophysical, and mathematical analysis of this injury. METHODS: Eyes of live anesthetized rabbits were ruptured by means of the injection of saline directly into the globe under high pressure. The clinical and pathological findings of the ruptured human and animal eyes were documented photographically and/or histopathologically. An experimental, biophysical, and mathematical analysis of the pressures and forces required to rupture the globe via direct injection using human cadavers, human <b>eye-bank</b> eyes, and classic physics and ophthalmic formulas was performed. The laws of Bernoulli, LaPlace, Friedenwald, and Pascal were applied to the theoretical and experimental models of this phenomenon. RESULTS: The clinical and pathological findings of scleral rupture, retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, and lens extrusion were observed. In the exploded human and rabbit eyes, the scleral ruptures appeared at the equator, the limbal area, or the posterior pole. In 2 of the 7 human eyes, the anterior segments appeared entirely normal despite the rupture, and cataract surgery was completed; surgery was canceled in the other 4 cases. In 4 of the 5 injected and ruptured rabbit eyes, the anterior segments appeared essentially normal. The experiments with human <b>eye-bank</b> eyes and the theoretical analyses of this entity show that the pressure required to produce such an injury is much more easily obtained with a 3 - or 5 -mL syringe than with a syringe 10 mL or larger. CONCLUSIONS: Explosion of an eyeball during the injection of anesthesia for ocular surgery is a devastating injury that may go unrecognized. The probability of an ocular explosion can be minimized by careful use of a syringe 10 mL or larger with a blunt needle, by discontinuing the injection if resistance is met, and by inspecting the globe prior to ocular massage or placement of a Honan balloon. When ocular explosion occurs, immediate referral to and intervention by a vitreoretinal surgeon is optimal. Practicing ophthalmologists should be aware of this blinding but preventable complication of ocular surgery...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of microscopy images of corneal endothelium is routinely {{carried out at}} eye banks to assess cell density, {{one of the main}} indicators of cornea health state and quality. We propose here a new method to derive endothelium cell density that, at variance with most of the available techniques, does not require the identification of cell contours. It exploits the feature that endothelium cells are approximately laid out as a regular tessellation of hexagonal shapes. This technique estimates the inverse transpose of a matrix generating this cellular lattice, from which the density is easily obtained. The algorithm has been implemented in a Matlab prototype and tested on a set of 21 corneal endothelium images. The cell densities obtained matched quite well with the ones manually estimated by <b>eye-bank</b> experts: the percent difference between them was on average - 0. 1 % (6. 5 % for absolute values). Albeit the performances of this new algorithm on the images of our test set are definitely good, a careful evaluation on a much larger data set is needed before any clinical application of the proposed technique could be envisaged. The collection of an adequate number of endothelium images and of their manual densities is currently in progress...|$|E

The vitreous body served as a positive control. Sections treated with Streptomyces hyaluronidase were used to confirm specificity. Monoclonal antibodies to myelin basic protein (MBP) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were used as additional controls. In fetal optic nerve, HA was localized in blood vessels, peripapillary sclera and the pial septae in the retrolaminar nerve. No staining was associated with axons. Staining for MBP was negative. In adults, HA was found surrounding the myelin sheaths in the retrolaminar nerve; staining decreased with age. In contrast, HA staining in myelinated peripheral nerves (e. g. ciliaries) remained unchanged with age. HA also was localized to the adventitia of arteries and veins throughout the posterior segment. Compared to age-matched normal eyes, HA staining was virtually absent around myelin sheaths of the retrolaminar nerve in POAG eyes. Similar changes were not found in other HA positive structures. In Schnabel’s cavernous optic atrophy, HA was present in increased amount in the atrophic area, but virtually absen...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe biometric, {{optical and}} {{physical}} properties of 19 pairs of isolated human <b>eye-bank</b> lenses {{ranging in age}} from 5 to 96 years were compared. Lens focal length and spherical aberration were measured using a scanning laser apparatus, lens thickness and the lens surface curvatures were measured by digitizing the lens profiles and equivalent refractive indices were calculated for each lens using this data. The second lens from each donor was used to measure resistance to physical deformation by providing a compressive force to the lens. The lens capsule was then removed from each lens and each measurement was repeated to ascertain what role the capsule plays in determining these optical and physical characteristics. Age dependent changes in lens focal length, lens surface curvatures and lens resistance to physical deformation are described. Isolated lens focal length was found to be significantly linearly correlated with both the anterior and posterior surface curvatures. No age dependent change in equivalent refractive index of the isolated lens was found. Although decapsulating human lenses causes similar changes in focal length to that which we have shown to occur when human lenses are mechanically stretched into an unaccommodated state, the effects are due to nonsystematic changes in lens curvatures. These studies reinforce the conclusion that lens hardening must be considered as an important factor in the development of presbyopia, that age changes in the human lens are not limited to the loss of accommodation that characterizes presbyopia but that the lens optical and physical properties change substantially with age in a complex manner...|$|E
