Creangă's entry into the school follows the discovery that all his close friends were moving out of Teodorescu's school and leaving him directly exposed to the teacher's severity. He ultimately persuades his father to bribe seminary teachers with gifts, noting that such presents could effectively spare a student from all learning effort. Parts of the text however insists on the teaching methods employed by the seminary, which involve learning by heart and chanting elements of Romanian grammar or entire works of commentary on the Bible, and lead the narrator to exclaim: [...] "A terrible way to stultify the mind, God alone knows!" [...] Living far from parental supervision and sharing a house {{with some of his}} colleagues and their landlord Pavel the cobbler, the young man pursues a bohemian lifestyle and is introduced to the drinking culture. The narrator sketches portraits of his friends, based on their defining abilities or moods: the old man Bodrângă, who entertains the group with flute songs; Oșlobanu, a man of the mountain, can lift and carry a cartload of logs on his back; the handsome David, whose early death is attributed by the writer to <b>excessive</b> <b>effort</b> in learning; the irreverent Mirăuță, who taunts Jewish businessmen with antisemitic poems, but spends little time on schoolwork; Trăsnea, who can only learn grammar by memorizing the entire textbook, and who is much upset by the recent replacement of Romanian Cyrillic in favor of a Latin alphabet; Zaharia [...] "Gâtlan" [...] Simionescu, a flatterer who can persuade adults to tolerate his daring gestures; Buliga, a priest given to drinking and merrymaking, who is depicted blessing the group's parties.

The writer also makes vague mention of his relationship with the daughter of a priest, who becomes his first lover.|$|E

And there was reason for it. In less than five months they had travelled twenty-five hundred miles, during the last eighteen hundred of which they had had but five days' rest.

He becomes spontaneously conscious that he has misbehaved, {{and he is not}} only ashamed of himself, but has the better prompting to try and heal any wound he has inflicted. Unhappily the habit of being offensive [...] "without meaning it" [...] leads usually to a way of making amends which the injured person cannot but regard as a being amiable without meaning it. The kindnesses, the complimentary indications or assurances, are apt to appear in the light of a penance adjusted to the foregoing lapses, and by the very contrast they offer call up a keener memory of the wrong they atone for. They are not a spontaneous prompting of goodwill, but an elaborate compensation. And, in fact, Dion's atoning friendliness has a ring of artificiality. Because he formerly disguised his good feeling towards you he now expresses more than he quite feels. It is in vain. Having made you extremely uncomfortable last week he has absolutely diminished his power of making you happy to-day: he struggles against this result by <b>excessive</b> <b>effort,</b> but he has taught you to observe his fitfulness rather than to be warmed by his episodic show of regard.|$|E

The beads possessed an average diameter of 3. 2 mm, porosity of 0. 9, specific surface are of- 100 m 21 g, average pore size of- 120 Angstroms, and specific gravity of 2. The beads exhibited a high adsorption capacity for Hg: 2, 2. 5, 3. 5 and 8 mmoVg dry at pH values of 2. 2, 4, 5,and 7, respectively. By comparison ungrafted chtosan had a capacity of- 1. 2 mmoVg dry at pH 4. Adsorption of Hg onto the beads was modeled using the Freundlich isotherm. Hg adsorption kinetics was modeled as radial diffusion into an infinite sphere.

40|$|Levels {{of fishing}} effort {{are defined as}} being {{excessive}} where they result in depletion of commercially valuable stocks and so threaten sustainable harvests. In many parts of Southeast Asia, this threat has been realized by {{the rapid expansion of}} commercial fisheries and the consequent increase in fishing effort. Southeast Asian fisheries are described as having a dualistic structure with distinct small-scale and large-scale subsectors. Competition and conflict between these subsectors is widespread and exacerbates the negative social consequences of <b>excessive</b> fishing <b>effort.</b> These include dissipation of resource rents, gear conflicts leading to broader social conflict, increased use of destructive fishing techniques, changes in the food supply and distribution channels (with disproportionate negative effects on rural populations), and increased concentration of economic power within the fisheries sector. Further, <b>excessive</b> fishing <b>effort</b> reduces incomes and standards of living for the majority of fishermen and undermines communitybased distributive and resource management mechanisms. The fundamental problems of fisheries management are inherently political, entailing issues of resource allocation and distributive equity. These problems are complicated by the role of fisheries as a social safety valve for the landless and the unemployed. As such, fisheries managment cannot be divorced from broader problems of Southeast Asian nations and are only solvdble within this larger context...|$|R

40|$|The Maine lobster {{fishery is}} one of the most {{economically}} valuable fisheries in the United States. In 2010 the fishery brought in a record 93 million pounds of lobster and was valued at nearly $ 310 million. Annual catch has risen steadily over the last seventy years as a result of both good conservation practices and increasing effort in the fishery. The fishery is an extremely valuable resource for the state of Maine and the entire Northeast region. However, current research suggests that the fishery may have reached a point of overcapacity and that catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) is not being maximized, thus resulting in lost productivity. Conflicts over <b>excessive</b> <b>effort</b> have been prevalent at the local, state, and interstate levels of management. There are environmental, social, and economic costs associated with <b>excessive</b> <b>effort,</b> but several proposals for effort management have been rejected by the industry and its managers. Effort management regulations that were established as part of the 1995 co-management law have been largely ineffective, and recent surveys have indicated that the majority of lobstermen are concerned about the number of traps fished in their areas. There is substantial anecdotal and experimental evidence supporting the need for effort reduction in the fishery, yet very little progress has been made toward achieving such a reduction. The objective of this report is to use official landings and effort data collected by Maine’s Department of Marine Resources to assess the nature and extent of the <b>excessive</b> <b>effort</b> problem in the Maine lobster fishery.
