5|$|The Croatian {{government}} attacked JNA garrisons {{and arms}} depots {{throughout the country}} on 14 September– an offensive dubbed the Battle of the Barracks. Vukovar's JNA barracks {{was one of those}} attacked that day, but the JNA managed to defend it. In retaliation, Serb paramilitaries attacked areas to the southwest of Vukovar from the direction of Negoslavci, forcing about 2,000 people to flee. There were reports of mass killings and scores of civilian deaths. Croatian forces outside the Vukovar perimeter received large quantities of arms and ammunition from depots captured elsewhere, enabling them to <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> against JNA attacks.|$|E
5|$|The Environment Agency's {{long-term}} {{policy is}} to <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> only to protect communities and infrastructure, with managed retreat as the solution to rising sea levels elsewhere, even at sites like Cley where the financial benefits from the recreational value of the reserve outweigh the cost of maintaining the sea defences. A scheme to allow tidal flooding of part of the reserve has already been implemented at Titchwell Marsh.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Artemisium, the Allies {{saw that}} they would {{probably}} {{not be able to}} <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> for another day, such were their losses. They thus debated whether they should withdraw from Artemisium, whilst they awaited news from Thermopylae. Themistocles ordered the men to slaughter and barbecue the flocks of the Euboeans, so that they would not fall into Persian hands. Abronichus arrived on the liaison ship from Thermopylae and told the Allies of the destruction of the Allied rearguard at Thermopylae. Since holding the Straits of Artemisium now no longer held any strategic purpose, and given their losses, the Allies decided to evacuate immediately.|$|E

5|$|The 2/18th {{attempted}} {{to defend the}} Tengah Airfield, but by 1:00pm in the afternoon of 9 February they {{had been reduced to}} only 330 men and were withdrawn back to the south-east of the airfield, occupying a position around Bulim along the Chu Kang Road, with the 2/29th Battalion on their left. Throughout the night of 9/10 February, minor clashes occurred as patrols were sent out to fend off Japanese probes. The battalion continued to <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> until 6:00am when, following receipt of orders to withdraw, it moved back to Keat Hong village to take up the role of brigade reserve. The carrier platoon covered the battalion's withdrawal, and amidst heavy artillery shelling, they ambushed two Japanese columns, each roughly company-sized, inflicting heavy casualties upon them with their Vickers machine-guns before breaking contact.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Mons {{took place}} {{as part of}} the Battle of the Frontiers, in which the {{advancing}} German armies clashed with the advancing Allied armies along the Franco-Belgian and Franco-German borders. The British position on the French flank meant that it stood {{in the path of the}} German 1st Army. The British reached Mons on 22 August and at the time, the French Fifth Army, located on the right of the British, was heavily engaged with the German 2nd and 3rd armies at the Battle of Charleroi. The British agreed to <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of the Condé–Mons–Charleroi Canal for twenty-four hours, to prevent the advancing German 1st Army from threatening the French left flank. The British thus spent the day digging in along the canal.|$|E
5|$|The bloody {{fighting}} obliged Paik to {{call for}} emergency reinforcements to <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> The Eighth Army responded immediately by sending the US 27th Infantry {{as well as the}} ROK 10th Regiment from the ROK 8th Division to reinforce the ROK 1st Division's three regiments. US Air Force aircraft also conducted a carpet bombing campaign against the advancing North Korean positions to undetermined effect. Around that time the KPA 15th Division, which had been supporting the KPA 13th Division, withdrew from the front to attack elsewhere, leaving the ROK 1st Division, with the US 27th Infantry, and the KPA 13th Division as principal opponents in the conflict that followed.|$|E

5|$|The {{fight at}} Masan {{remained}} a bitter stalemate {{during the entire}} six weeks of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter. Each side attempted several offensives on the other {{in an attempt to}} force a withdrawal, but the North Koreans were unable to pierce the UN perimeter, and the UN troops were unable to overwhelm the North Koreans to the point they were forced to withdraw. The battle itself was a tactical tie, since neither side could decisively defeat the other, however the UN units achieved their strategic goal of preventing the North Koreans from advancing further east and threatening Pusan. Instead, they were able to <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> against repeated attacks until the Inchon attack, and were thus successful in defeating the North Korean army in subsequent engagements.|$|E

5|$|Following {{an initial}} {{penetration}} to the north, the retreating 34th Infantry moved south to Nonsan. On July 15, the 19th Infantry moved its 2nd Battalion to fill {{some of the}} gaps left by the 34th. There, it was reinforced by troops from the Republic of Korea Army. The combined forces observed a large build-up of North Korean troops {{on the west side}} of the river. At 03:00 on July 16, the North Koreans launched a massive barrage of tank, artillery and mortar fire on the 19th Infantry positions and North Korean troops began to cross the river in boats. The North Korean forces gathered on the west bank and assaulted the positions of the 1st Battalion's C and E Companies, followed by a second landing against B Company. North Korean forces pushed against the entire battalion, threatening to overwhelm it. The regimental commander ordered all support troops and officers to the line and they were able to repulse the assault.

5|$|General Dean, the divisional commander, was {{angered by}} the poor {{performance}} of the 34th Infantry Regiment during the battle. He allegedly was upset that the regiment retreated so quickly without attempting to further delay the North Koreans. He considered ordering the regiment back north immediately but {{did not do so}} for fear of ambush. Dean replaced the commander of the 34th Infantry, Colonel Lovless, and ordered the 3rd Battalion back north, but when it encountered North Korean resistance it immediately became disorganized and was forced to withdraw. The engagement at Pyongtaek had caused a significant decline in morale among American forces fighting on the peninsula, and this would continue until victories at Inchon and the Pusan Perimeter allowed them to go on the offensive. Dean took the blame for the defeat himself, and historians consider him at least partially at fault for expecting one inexperienced battalion to <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> against a numerically superior enemy who was well-trained.|$|E
5|$|Minsk was liberated by the Soviet 1st and 3rd Belorussian Fronts on 3 July, but Model still {{hoped to}} re-establish {{the front to}} the west of the city, with the aid of {{divisions}} from Army Groups North and North Ukraine. However, German strength was unequal to the task, and he had been driven out of Vilnius and Baranovichi by 8 July. At the same time, the 1st Ukrainian Front (now commanded by Ivan Konev) and the 1st Belorussian Front's left wing (which had been uncommitted thus far) opened up a fresh offensive against Army Group North Ukraine. In this battle, the First Panzer Army managed to <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> east of Lvov using Model's defensive tactics, but was forced to retreat when the Fourth Panzer Army, weakened by the steady flow of units to Army Group Centre, was unable to stem the Soviet penetrations of its front. Model stopped the Red Army's advance just short of Warsaw by 3 August, setting up a continuous front from south of Shaulyay to the right boundary on the Vistula near Pulawy.|$|E

5|$|On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium. The 4e DI {{was ordered}} to <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of the Sambre river. De Hauteclocque was placed in charge of three {{infantry}} battalions. To his dismay, orders came to pull back to the Canal de l'Escaut. From there the 4e DI retreated northward, becoming encircled in the Lille pocket on 28 May. De Hauteclocque received permission to escape through German lines. He attempted {{to make his way}} back to the French lines by pretending to be a civilian refugee, but was apprehended by a German patrol and taken prisoner when they discovered an old military pay receipt. He was taken back to a German command post, where he secretly destroyed the receipt. He convinced a German colonel that he had been wounded in Morocco, suffered from malaria, and had six children, all of which was true, and he was thus exempted from military service, which was false. The Germans let him go. He then made his way to the Crozat Canal, swam across, and encountered a French patrol.|$|E
5|$|The Belgo-Congolese {{situation}} remained difficult {{until early}} June, when the Baro and Sobat rivers rose enough for reinforcements from the Congo to reach them. They {{then decided to}} try and sever the Italian supply line between Saïo and Mogi, another town upon the plateau. To <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> near Bortai Brook, the Belgians could only spare around 250 men for an attack. It was hoped that cutting the Italians off would allow the British, stalled in their advance at Gidami, to move south and encircle Saïo. On 9 June the Belgian force attacked Mogi, their flank covered {{by the arrival of}} a new battalion from the Congo. The Italian garrison, numbering around 300 men, held off the assault. Believing that that the town could only be taken at a heavy cost, the Belgians instead fortified their positions around Mogi and sent patrols to ambush the road by which Saïo was being supplied.|$|E
5|$|The First Anglo-Dutch War (1652–54) saw the {{development}} of the line of battle, a tactic where ships formed a continuous line to fire broadsides at an enemy. Previously, decisive action in naval engagements had been achieved through boarding and melee, but after the middle of the 17th century tactical doctrine focused more on disabling or sinking an opponent through superior firepower from a distance. This entailed major changes in military doctrines, shipbuilding, and professionalism in European navies from the 1650s onwards. The line of battle favored very large ships that could <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> in the face of heavy fire, later known as ships of the line. The new tactics also depended on the ability of strong, centralized governments to maintain large, permanent fleets led by a professional officer corps. The increased power of the state at the expense of individual landowners led to the expansion of armies and navies, and in the late 1660s Sweden embarked on an expansive shipbuilding program.|$|E

5|$|The First Anglo-Dutch War (1652–54) saw the {{development}} of the line of battle, a tactic where ships formed a continuous line to fire broadsides at an enemy. Previously, naval tactics had favored short-range firepower and boarding with intent to take prizes. After the mid-17th century, tactics shifted from close-quarter fighting to disabling or sinking opponents through superior, long-distance firepower. This entailed major changes in doctrine, shipbuilding, and professionalism in European navies from the 1650s onwards. The line of battle favored large ships that were heavily armed and robust enough to <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> in the face of enemy fire. The increased centralization and concentration of power in the emerging nation-states during the late 17th century allowed for a great expansion of armies and navies, and new government shipyards began building much much larger ships.

5|$|Meanwhile, the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry back at Chonui {{remained}} understrength. Half of {{the force}} had constituted Task Force Smith at Osan. B and C Companies were thus still refitting at Chochiwon, leaving A and D Companies to <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> {{with a handful of}} replacements to fill the extra positions. The battalion numbered around 500 men in total. The 1st Battalion emplaced on hills overlooking the south road of Chonui, northwest of Chochiwon and prepared to meet and delay the advancing North Korean forces, while the 3rd Battalion emplaced behind it in reserve. Around 0555 on July 10, the Americans began to detect North Korean movement through the morning fog. Fifteen minutes after daybreak, a whistle blew, immediately followed by small arms fire on the American positions. American forces at first fired indiscriminately into the fog until the regimental commander, Richard W. Stephens, stopped them. At 0700 the 1st Battalion then came under heavy mortar fire, and A Company on the leftmost ridge was assailed with fire from higher ground by North Korean forces of the 4th Infantry Division. The American forces began using 4.2-inch mortars on the North Korean positions in order to prevent them from advancing directly on their positions. Around 0800 the fog began to lift, and the Americans spotted four T-34 tanks in the village and subsequently called for another airstrike.|$|E
