The influence of titanium dioxide crystal and particle shape on coating solar reflectance was studied, {{and the result}} showed that the coating contains Rutile titanium dioxide has good reflective performance. The influence of non-ferrous pigment on coating reflective properties was studied. Among these pigments, the reflectivity of iron oxide red which has darker color is comparatively higher, and has good compatibility with coating system. It was selected as non-ferrous pigment of this brunet department coating. Iron oxide black and medium <b>chromium</b> <b>yellow</b> was added to mix the coating color, when the dosage of pigment is iron oxide red 3. 72 %, Iron oxide black 0. 036 %, medium <b>chromium</b> <b>yellow</b> 0. 24 %, the coating is brown, and the solar reflectance could reach 80. 22 %. The basic properties of coating were all conform to the National Standards, and it is a brunet exterior wall coating which has uniform atomization performance and good reflection insulation performance. Perface Building energy efficiency [1, 2] is the chiefly aspect to improve the efficiency of the primary social resources. The reflective insulation coating on the building exterior wall which is spread {{on the surface of the}} building can effectively reduce the temperature of the surface and internal of th...|$|R
5000|$|For centuries, {{orpiment}} was ground {{down and}} used as a pigment in painting and for sealing wax, and is even used in Ancient China as a correction fluid. [...] It {{was one of the}} few clear, bright-yellow pigments available to artists until the 19th century. However, its extreme toxicity and incompatibility with other common pigments, including lead and copper-based substances such as verdigris and azurite, meant that its use as a pigment ended when cadmium <b>yellows,</b> <b>chromium</b> <b>yellows</b> and organic dye-based colors were introduced during the 19th century.|$|R
30|$|Some {{pigments}} like <b>chromium</b> <b>yellow</b> and cadmium chromate [21] {{were only}} {{found in the}} tube colours. It is uncertain to what extent Krøyer has actually used these pigments in his paintings. Further analyses of other paintings by the artist could possibly provide information with regard to this question. In contrast the pigments vermilion, minium and chromium orange were all identified in the Drachmann portrait, whereas they were not present {{in any of the}} tube colours in the painting cabinet. This emphasises that conclusions about an artist’s painting materials cannot be drawn based on access to the materials alone without including analyses of the paintings themselves.|$|R

30|$|An {{interesting}} observation {{was made}} during LIBS measurements performed at different spots over the brown painted areas. At the 1 st laser pulse analysis, chromium (Cr) was clearly detected {{but was not}} further observed during analysis at the same spot with the 2 nd and the following pulses. This implies {{that the existence of}} Cr is only superficial. It is noted that no lead (Pb) was detected, which in correlation with Cr could suggest the superficial existence of <b>chromium</b> <b>yellow</b> used in the yellow paint. Noticing that at the brown area investigated, it is seen that {{a small part of the}} paint is missing, in a way that indicates a local intervention performed at a later time, it could be speculated that the localized and superficial presence of Cr could be correlated with the application of an adhesive during a modern restoration (e.g. a lime free casein adhesive in which commonly an oxide or salt of chromium is added to improve water resistance) [40].|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of nitrilotriacetic acid trisodium salt (NTA) on the mutagenic and clastogenic activity of several water-insoluble or poorly soluble chromium compounds {{was determined by}} means of the Salmonella/microsome assay (plate test on TA 100 strain) and the sister-chromatid exchange (SCE) test in mammalian cell cultures (CHO line). NTA in itself did not induce gene mutations nor did it increase the frequency of SCE. Cr(VI) compounds (Pb, Ba, Zn, Sr and Ca chromates) and an industrial Cr(VI) pigment, chromium orange (containing PbCrO 4 ·PbO), were inactive or scarcely active mutagens in the Salmonella/microsome test when dissolved in water, but they were increasingly mutagenic when solubilized by 0. 5 N NaOH or NTA (10 or 100 mg/ml). Also, the mutagenic activity of Cr(VI), contaminating an industrial Cr(III) pigment (chromite), was slightly enhanced by NTA. Mutagenicity of chromates was correlated with the amounts of Cr(VI) solubilized by NTA or alkali, as determined by the colorimetric reaction with diphenylcarbazide and atomic absorption spectrophotometry, and was decreased by incubation with microsomes, due to reduction of Cr(VI) to the genetically inactive Cr(III) form. In the SCE assay, the insoluble or poorly soluble Ba, Zn, Sr and Ca chromates and the insoluble Cr(VI) pigments zinc yellow (containing ZnCrO 4 ·Zn(OH 2)), <b>chromium</b> <b>yellow</b> and molybdenum orange (both containing PbCrO 4) were directly clastogenic due to cellular endocytosis taking place in prolonged treatments, and NTA significantly increased their chromosome-damaging activity...|$|R

30|$|Raman spectra {{recorded}} on brown painted areas were rather weak in intensity {{and failed to}} provide any reliable information concerning pigments. However, strong emissions from both manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) were detected by LIBS in the brown paint (Fig.  10 b), and this {{could be interpreted as}} evidence of a mixture of manganese black or brown pigment with red iron oxide. Likewise the detection of chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) in the yellow painted parts of the door frame was critical in obtaining strong evidence for the use of <b>chromium</b> <b>yellow</b> (PbCrO 4) possibly in mixture with yellow ochre (hydrous ferric oxide, Fe 2 O 3 ·nH 2 O) as it can be suggested based on the detection of Fe at the same spot. Detection of significant amounts of barium (Ba) by LIBS in the red, brown, light blue and yellow paint domains suggests the presence of barium sulphate, and this was further confirmed on the basis of Raman spectra collected in the yellow painted areas. The dominant presence of zinc (Zn) may be translated as an evidence for the presence of zinc oxide (ZnO) possibly used as an extender in the paint. However the simultaneous presence of barium and zinc might indicate the presence of lithopone, ZnS·BaSO 4. The presence of titanium (Ti), in very low concentration, in the blue and brown areas, but in higher concentration in the red and yellow paint, could be ascribed to impurities present in earth pigments and matrix minerals [39] or to titanium white (TiO 2) probably coming from later painting interventions known to have taken place at the church {{in the beginning of the}} twentieth century CE. Unfortunately, no additional documentation concerning these intervention was found. It is noted, that the presence of TiO 2 was not confirmed by Raman analysis. Aluminium (Al) and magnesium (Mg) were also detected all across the door frame, most likely originating from matrix minerals, while the presence of strontium (Sr) relates to the presence of calcium carbonate.|$|R

40|$|The {{electroplating}} industries use soluble nickel salts {{in numerous}} applications. Over {{the past few}} years this has become problematic due to the reclassification of these salts from a harmful substance to now a toxic substance. The introduction of the legislation REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation & restriction of CHemicals) has meant the electroplating industry has had to use less harmful chemicals where possible, thus meaning companies are investing in research to find an alternative to the nickel deposit. In this study, alternative deposits under investigation as a potential replacement to the nickel deposit under the decorative chromium deposit has been characterised in terms of the appearance, surface topography and corrosion resistance by using spectrophotometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), linear polarisation, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and accelerated corrosion salt spray methods. Spectrophotometry identified that a white Cu-Sn alloy gave a bluer appearance in comparison to the nickel deposit, when the chromium deposit was plated on top this modified the colour slightly giving the white Cu-Sn alloy with chromium a similar appearance to the nickel and <b>chromium</b> deposit. The <b>yellow</b> Cu-Sn alloy was yellow in colour with a visibly dull appearance, but when chromium was plated on top of the yellow Cu-Sn alloy the colour was improved but still remained dull. The SEM and AFM results identified that the white Cu-Sn alloy deposit had similar nodulated topography to the nickel deposit and when the chromium was plated on top the topography changed only slightly. While the yellow Cu-Sn alloy deposits showed a more crystalline structure and increased roughness in comparison to the nickel deposit, the chromium deposit plated on top did not change the structure of the underlying deposit but it did reduce the roughness slightly. Electrochemical corrosion tests showed the white Cu-Sn alloy to have a higher polarisation resistance compared to the nickel deposit, thus suggesting it would provide similar corrosion protection to the nickel deposit. The yellow Cu-Sn alloy proved to have a faster corrosion rate in comparison to the nickel deposit. Accelerated corrosion tests proved the white Cu-Sn alloy to be more corrosive than the nickel despite the electrochemical test results, it was concluded that the white Cu-Sn alloy deposit was porous and therefore provided less corrosion protection to the substrate in comparison to the nickel deposit. The yellow Cu-Sn alloy had a lower corrosion protection than the nickel deposit and when combined as a duplex Cu-Sn alloy with the white Cu-Sn alloy deposit there was no improvement in corrosion performance. The plated chromium deposit did improve the corrosion protection for most deposits but none of the alternatives could match the corrosion protection offered by the standard nickel with chromium deposit. This study concluded that the white Cu-Sn alloy with chromium deposit was found to be a potential alternative to the nickel with chromium deposit for applications where appearance is primary, no alternative could be found to match the corrosion protection provided by the standard nickel and chromium process.
