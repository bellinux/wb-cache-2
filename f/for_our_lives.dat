As a result, Captain Peter Barron of the brigade's anti-tank battery was given command of 10 Para. One of the official war photographers inside the perimeter wrote:"This is the fourth day of fighting and camera work is almost out of the question. All day we have been under shell, mortar and machine gun fire. We are completely surrounded and our perimeter is becoming smaller every hour, now it is a matter of fighting <b>for</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives.</b> If our land forces don't make contact with us soon then we've had it".|$|E

500|$|The {{creation}} of propaganda {{has been described}} as the collectives' core function. Among their best-known publications are the books Days of War, Nights of Love, Expect Resistance, Evasion, [...] the pamphlets To Change Everything: an anarchist appeal (available in paper, PDF and video form) and Fighting <b>For</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Lives</b> (of which, to date, they claim to have printed 600,000 copies), the hardcore punk/political zine Inside Front, and the music of hardcore punk bands. Several websites are maintained by individual cells, including Crimethinc.com, operated by the Far East Cell, which hosts propaganda, excerpts from available publications, and a blog of the activities of other cells. CrimethInc. is connected to publishing collectives/organizations with similar ideas, notably the Curious George Brigade, which has written a number of publications including Anarchy in the Age of Dinosaurs. In 2005, they began publishing a half-gloss journal, Rolling Thunder, with the byline [...] "An Anarchist Journal of Dangerous Living", which released its eighth issue in 2009. CrimethInc. texts have received wide coverage in the anarchist media and in academic publications, and have been used as reading materials for university courses on anarchism.|$|E

2500|$|Hillsong is {{affiliated}} with Australian Christian Churches (the Assemblies of God in Australia), which belongs within the Pentecostal tradition of Christianity. The church's beliefs are Evangelical and Pentecostal in that it holds the Bible as the truth and authoritative in matters of faith. They believe that Jesus Christ is God Incarnate, and the only begotten Son of the Father, who reconciled humanity to God through his death and resurrection. The church believes forgiveness for the wrong we've done and being part of God's family can only be achieved through repenting of our wrongdoing, believing in Jesus as your Lord and saviour, and submitting to his will <b>for</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives.</b> They believe {{that in order to}} live a fruitful Christian life a person should, among other things, seek the baptism in the Holy Spirit, and that the Holy Spirit enables the use of spiritual gifts, which includes, and is not limited to, speaking in tongues.|$|E

40|$|The grand {{narratives}} {{have all}} but gone – what is left are numerous narratives, each addressing a certain aspect of our lives; there is a different narrative <b>for</b> <b>our</b> professional <b>lives,</b> another <b>for</b> <b>our</b> family <b>lives,</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> social <b>lives</b> and yet another <b>for</b> <b>our</b> spiritual <b>lives.</b> We find ourselves in this ‘transit hall’, forever changing flights or trains, depending on which narrative sphere we are entering or leaving. In each narrative we take on a different character, defined and shaped by the specificities of that narrative. Thus, ‘transition’ {{in the sense of}} change can no longer be understood as only linear, but as constant and multidimensional. With the use of Lacan’s discourse theory, this fragmented existence will be unpacked and a redemptive alternative sought. This paper is an attempt to address this multi-narrative existence without imposing yet another grand narrative. Thus it focuses on offering a narrative space that is, (1) holistic, {{in the sense that it}} addresses all the different narratives, (2) pastoral, in that it addresses the person and (3) redemptive, in that it offers something new, meaningful and hopeful. Such a narrative space moves the church from its ‘ghetto mindset’, where traditions and values are maintained, to being fully open and vulnerable to the present reality, whilst yearning for the Messianic to reveal an alternative future. </p...|$|R
