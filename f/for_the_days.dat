5|$|In the 1903 Tour de France, the {{organisation}} guaranteed {{that the first}} 50 cyclists in the final general classification would earn at least 5 francs per day. In 1904, if not more than 50 cyclists would finish, also cyclists who dropped out during the race would still get 5 francs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> {{they had been in}} the race. This rule was added to attract cyclists who otherwise would not enter, because the Tour needed enough competitors to remain credible.|$|E
5|$|Sharp was re-elected to the Fourteenth Congress, {{during which}} he served as {{chairman}} of the Committee on Private Land Claims. He supported the controversial Compensation Act of 1816 sponsored by fellow Kentuckian Richard Mentor Johnson. The measure, which paid Congressmen a flat salary instead of paying them on a daily basis <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> when they were in session, was unpopular with the voters of his district. When the next congressional session opened in December 1816, Sharp reversed his position and voted to repeal the law, but the damage was already done; he lost his seat in the House in the next election.|$|E
5|$|As the {{blizzard}} progressed, Patrick Dolan began to rant deliriously, stripped off his clothes, {{and ran into}} the woods. He returned shortly afterwards and died a few hours later. Not long after, possibly because 12-year-old Lemuel Murphy was near death, some of the group began to eat flesh from Dolan's body. Lemuel's sister tried to feed some to her brother, but he died shortly afterwards. Eddy, Salvador, and Luis refused to eat. The next morning, the group stripped the muscle and organs from the bodies of Antonio, Dolan, Graves, and Murphy and dried it to store <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> ahead, taking care to ensure that nobody would have to eat his or her relatives.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{believed}} that Congressional business was too slow and tedious, {{and that the}} per diem system of compensation encouraged delays {{on the part of}} members. To remedy this, he sponsored the Compensation Act of 1816. The measure proposed paying annual salaries of $1,500 to congressmen rather than a $6 per diem <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> the body was in session. (At the time, this had the effect of increasing the total compensation from about $900 to $1500. Johnson noted that congressmen had not had a pay increase in 27 years, and that $1500 was less than the salaries of the 28 clerks employed by the government.) Johnson's bill provided that if a congressman was absent, his salary would be reduced proportionally.|$|E

25|$|In the Ashkenazi tradition, {{each night}} after the {{lighting}} of the candles, the hymn Ma'oz Tzur is sung. The song contains six stanzas. The first and last deal with general themes of divine salvation, and the middle four deal with events of persecution in Jewish history, and praises God for survival despite these tragedies (the exodus from Egypt, the Babylonian captivity, the miracle of the holiday of Purim, the Hasmonean victory), and a longing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> when Judea will finally triumph over Rome.|$|E
25|$|The church publishes two weekly {{literature}} {{types that}} are distributed to attendees {{as they enter}} the auditorium during the Sunday services. The first type serves as a programme but is verbally referred to as the 'bulletin.' It contains a message from the senior pastor, and a financial report on the tithes and offerings received from the previous week's services. Moreover, the programme includes a listing of the church activities from the various ministries for the current Sunday as well as <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> ahead. Such activities are collectively referred to as 'Kingdom Opportunities,' and their publication in the bulletin is meant to attract participants or volunteers for the corresponding events.|$|E
25|$|One, the WEEKLY frame, {{consists}} of a simple downward movement. It combines with the signs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> of the week, which then lose their inherent movement. For example, 'Monday' {{consists of}} an M/O hand made with a circling movement. 'MondayWEEKLY' (that is, 'on Mondays') is therefore signed as an M/O hand that drops downward, but without the circling movement. A similar ALL DAY frame (a sideward pan) combines with times of the day, such as 'morning' and 'afternoon', which likewise keep their handshape and location but lose their original movement. Numeral incorporation (see above) also uses frames. However, in ASL frames are most productively utilized for verbal aspect.|$|E

25|$|According to tradition, Rashi {{was first}} brought to learn Torah {{by his father}} on Shavuot day {{at the age of}} five. His father was his main Torah teacher until his death when Rashi was still a youth. At the age of 17 he married and soon after went to learn in the yeshiva of Rabbi Yaakov ben Yakar in Worms, {{returning}} to his wife three times yearly, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Days</b> of Awe, Passover and Shavuot. When Rabbi Yaakov died in 1064, Rashi continued learning in Worms for another year in the yeshiva of his relative, Rabbi Isaac ben Eliezer Halevi, who was also chief rabbi of Worms. Then he moved to Mainz, where he studied under another of his relatives, Rabbi Isaac ben Judah, the rabbinic head of Mainz and one of the leading sages of the Lorraine region straddling France and Germany.|$|E
25|$|In the Anglican tradition, Compline was {{originally}} merged with Vespers to form Evening Prayer in the Book of Common Prayer. ECUSA's Book of Offices of 1914, the Church of England's proposed Prayer Book of 1928, and the Anglican Church of Canada's Prayer Book of 1959 restored {{a form of}} Compline to Anglican worship. Several contemporary liturgical texts, including the American 1979 Book of Common Prayer, the Anglican Church of Canada's Book of Alternative Services, and the Church of England's Common Worship, provide modern forms of the service. The Common Worship service consists of the opening sentences, the confession of sins, the psalms and other Bible lessons, the canticle of Simeon, and prayers, including a benediction. There are authorised alternatives <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> {{of the week and}} the seasons of the Christian year.
