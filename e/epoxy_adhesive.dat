25|$|On July 10, 2007, after {{a lengthy}} investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board found that epoxy glue used to hold the roof in place during {{construction}} was not appropriate for long-term bonding. This {{was determined to be}} the cause of the roof collapse. The Power-Fast <b>Epoxy</b> <b>Adhesive</b> used in the installation was designed for short-term loading, such as wind or earthquake loads, not long-term loading, such as the weight of a panel.|$|E
25|$|One form of {{retrofit}} is {{to drill}} numerous holes into {{the surface of}} the wall, and secure short L-shaped sections of rebar to the surface of each hole with <b>epoxy</b> <b>adhesive.</b> Additional vertical and horizontal rebar is then secured to the new elements, a form is erected, and an additional layer of concrete is poured. This modification may be combined with additional footings in excavated trenches and additional support ledgers and tie-backs to retain the span on the bounding walls.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes viaducts {{may fail}} in the {{connections}} between components. This {{was seen in the}} failure of the Cypress Freeway in Oakland, California, during the Loma Prieta earthquake. This viaduct was a two-level structure, and the upper portions of the columns were not well connected to the lower portions that supported the lower level; this caused the upper deck to collapse upon the lower deck. Weak connections such as these require additional external jacketing – either through external steel components or by a complete jacket of reinforced concrete, often using stub connections that are glued (using <b>epoxy</b> <b>adhesive)</b> into numerous drilled holes. These stubs are then connected to additional wrappings, external forms (which may be temporary or permanent) are erected, and additional concrete is poured into the space. Large connected structures similar to the Cypress Viaduct must also be properly analyzed in their entirety using dynamic computer simulations.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Epoxy</b> <b>{{adhesives}}</b> are a {{major part}} of the class of adhesives called [...] "structural adhesives" [...] or [...] "engineering adhesives" [...] (that includes polyurethane, acrylic, cyanoacrylate, and other chemistries.) These high-performance adhesives are used in the construction of aircraft, automobiles, bicycles, boats, golf clubs, skis, snowboards, and other applications where high strength bonds are required. <b>Epoxy</b> <b>adhesives</b> can be developed to suit almost any application. They can be used as adhesives for wood, metal, glass, stone, and some plastics. They can be made flexible or rigid, transparent or opaque/colored, fast setting or slow setting. <b>Epoxy</b> <b>adhesives</b> are better in heat and chemical resistance than other common <b>adhesives.</b> In general, <b>epoxy</b> <b>adhesives</b> cured with heat will be more heat- and chemical-resistant than those cured at room temperature.

30|$|The {{effect of}} primer P was drastic because the use {{increased}} the critical fracture energies of adhesive B and C approximately three times.

2500|$|The {{restoration}} of the vase began in June 1988, and was filmed by the BBC History and Archaeology Unit. Deconstruction of the vase was achieved by wrapping it inside and out with blotting paper and letting it sit in a glass desiccator injected with solvents for three days, {{at the end of}} which it was separated into 189 pieces. After removing the remnants of the old adhesive and cleaning the fragments, an <b>epoxy</b> <b>adhesive,</b> Hxtal NYL, was used in conjunction with an acrylic resin to join the pieces. Although efforts were made to avoid [...] "trap-outs", where the placing of a fragment prevents the next from fitting in, Williams and Smith left for Christmas in 1988 [...] "not knowing whether they would be able to fit the last few shards without having to dismantle six months' work." [...] These fears proved unfounded; [...] "fter several weeks of assembling and reassembling the top half of the Vase, the final fragment of rim dropped in and fitted perfectly." [...] At the end of nine months' work, only 17 minuscule fragments remained unplaced, rather than the 34 that were omitted from the previous restoration. After filling in the cracks with coloured resin, Williams gave his verdict: [...] "It's OK... ruined my Christmas." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the experimental examination - {{by means of}} ultrasonic NDT - of adhesions constructed by polymeric materials bonded with various <b>epoxy</b> <b>adhesives.</b> The adhered specimens consist of two identical short beam-shaped pieces bonded together by <b>epoxy</b> <b>adhesives.</b> The adhesive layer during their bending loading is thus found in the neutral zone of the final beam. It is ensured that the beam failure takes place by shear stresses developing on the adhesion interphase. These adhesions are first tested by the ultrasonic NDT method {{and then by the}} short beam shear test, until their failure. Finally measurements of acoustical properties of interfacial adhesion are shown and correlated with destructive strength measurements...|$|R
40|$|The {{strength}} {{of stainless steel}} joints bonded with two <b>epoxy</b> <b>adhesives</b> was investigated. The experimental programme included tests on single-lap and butt joints, as well as thick-adherend and napkin ring shear tests. Results suggested that the tensile and shear strengths of the <b>epoxy</b> <b>adhesives</b> were quite similar. However, finite element analyses raised doubts on the true adhesive strengths, due to the complex stress state in joint tests and pressure-dependent adhesive behaviour. In spite of some uncertainties, finite element analyses showed that failure could be fairly well predicted by a maximum shear strain criterion...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{advantages}} that polymeric adhesives can offer {{compared to the}} more traditional methods of joining such as bolting, brazing, welding, mechanical fasteners, etc. and <b>epoxy</b> <b>adhesives</b> represent {{the most common type}} of structural <b>adhesive.</b> When polymerised, <b>epoxy</b> <b>adhesives</b> are amorphous and highly-crosslinked materials and this microstructure results in many useful properties for structural engineering applications, such as a high modulus and failure strength, low creep, and, by careful formulation, good performance at elevated temperatures. However, the structure of such thermosetting adhesives also generally leads to one highly undesirable property in that they are relatively brittle materials, with a poor resistance to crack initiation and growth. Nevertheless, the incorporation of a second phase of dispersed rubbery particles into the epoxy polymer can greatly increase their toughness without significantly impairing the other desirable engineering properties. Thus, such rubber-toughened <b>epoxy</b> <b>adhesives</b> can be used, for example, in applications where a very high impact resistance is required for the adhesively-bonded joint...|$|R
50|$|Die {{attachment}} is {{the step}} during which a die is mounted and {{fixed to the}} package or support structure (header). For high-powered applications, the die is usually eutectic bonded onto the package, using e.g. gold-tin or gold-silicon solder (for good heat conduction). For low-cost, low-powered applications, the die is often glued directly onto a substrate (such as a printed wiring board) using an <b>epoxy</b> <b>adhesive.</b>|$|E
