Secondary school pupils mainly attend Ysgol Botwnnog.|$|E

Offshore Palawan, Faye capsized a boat, killing {{seven of the}} 54aboard; the remaining were rescued. In Iba, the typhoon de-roofed 80% of the city's <b>homes,</b> <b>where</b> 200,000 out of 500,000residents were rendered homeless, which is 40% of the city's population.

5|$|The colonies {{are found}} in rotten wood, in the ground, under rocks or stones and in urban areas. The ants are both diurnal and nocturnal and forage on trees, in low {{vegetation}} and into human <b>homes,</b> <b>where</b> they are regarded as pests. These ants eat a variety of foods, including fruits, insects, sucrose, nectar and bird feces. They visit various flowers and attend {{to a variety of}} butterfly larvae. The thorny devil, an Australian lizard, predominantly feeds on Ochetellus workers, and other ant species also prey on them.|$|E

5|$|With Hitler's approval, Himmler {{intended}} {{that the}} new society of the Nazi regime should destigmatise illegitimate births, particularly of children fathered {{by members of the}} SS, who were vetted for racial purity. His hope was that each SS family would have between four and six children. The Lebensborn (Fountain of Life) association, founded by Himmler in 1935, created a series of maternity <b>homes</b> <b>where</b> single mothers could be accommodated during their pregnancies. Both parents were examined for racial suitability before acceptance. The resulting children were often adopted into SS families. The homes were also made available to the wives of SS and NSDAP members, who quickly filled over half the available spots.|$|E
5|$|During the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour of South Africa during 1948–49, {{the first}} under apartheid, the BBC {{commentator}} John Arlott was horrified {{when he saw}} a black man assaulted for no reason. This prompted him to visit several townships where he found black people living in very poor conditions. He contrasted this unfavourably with the luxury of the <b>homes</b> <b>where</b> he was entertained by white families. Billy Griffith, one of the touring team, accompanied him on one visit to a township, and was similarly appalled, but did not speak out against it. Arlott later condemned apartheid, during a 1950 BBC broadcast, and refused to commentate during future tours to the country. His example was followed by the England batsman and clergyman David Sheppard, who declined to tour South Africa, refused to play the team in 1960, and spoke out publicly against the policies of the South African government despite efforts by the MCC to silence him. Otherwise, there was little protest in England against South African cricket during the 1950s.|$|E

25|$|Since {{a buffet}} {{involves}} diners serving themselves, {{it has in}} the past been considered an informal form of dining, less formal than table service.

25|$|Gas pipes {{were first}} {{laid in the}} late 19th century, and gas stoves started to replace the older {{coal-fired}} stoves. Gas was more expensive than coal, though, and thus the new technology was first installed in the wealthier <b>homes.</b> <b>Where</b> workers' apartments were equipped with a gas stove, gas distribution would go through a coin meter.|$|E
25|$|On 18 January 2003, bushfires {{that had}} been burning in the remote {{wilderness}} west of Canberra broke containment lines and engulfed some of Canberra. About 500 <b>homes</b> <b>where</b> destroyed before {{a change in the}} weather brought the bushfire under control. The suburb of Duffy was hit especially hard, with some 200 homes destroyed. Four people died in the conflagration and many more were injured.|$|E
25|$|Before the First {{industrial}} revolution work was mainly done through two systems: domestic system and craft guilds. In the domestic system merchants took materials to <b>homes</b> <b>where</b> artisans performed the necessary work, craft guilds {{on the other}} hand were associations of artisans which passed work from one shop to another, for example: leather was tanned by a tanner, passed to curriers, and finally arrived at shoemakers and saddlers.|$|E

25|$|Chapati - Most common bread made {{in urban}} <b>homes,</b> <b>where</b> a tandoor is not available. Chapatis are cooked over a flat or {{slightly}} convex dark colored pan known as 'tava'. Chapatis {{are made of}} whole wheat flour and are thin and unleavened. Tortillas {{are probably the most}} common analogous to chapatis, though chapatis are slightly thick. A variant, known as 'romali roti' (lit. Handkerchief bread), is very thin and very large in size.|$|E
25|$|In {{parts of}} India, the birds {{can be a}} {{nuisance}} to agriculture as they damage crops. Its adverse effects on crops, however, seem to be offset by the beneficial role it plays by consuming prodigious quantities of pests such as grasshoppers. They {{can also be a}} problem in gardens and <b>homes</b> <b>where</b> they damage plants, attack their reflections breaking glass and mirrors, perch and scratch cars or leave their droppings. Many cities where they have been introduced and gone feral have peafowl management programmes. These include educating citizens on how to prevent the birds from causing damage while treating the birds humanely.|$|E
25|$|The {{country is}} rich and fertile, and the farms {{appear to have}} been {{advantageously}} cultivated, but it now has the marks of a country in ruins, {{a large portion of the}} proprietors having abandoned their homes. On the high road where heretofore was a continuous stream of travelers and vehicles, not a single traveler was seen from week to week, month to month. The countryside was silent. The very tracks of the carriages were grown over with grass or weeds. Travelers walked along bypaths. The villages are abandoned, the residents having fled to the north, leaving their <b>homes,</b> <b>where</b> possible, in charge of elder persons and servants.|$|E
