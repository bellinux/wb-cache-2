5|$|According to Nurkse, {{underdeveloped}} countries lack adequate {{purchasing power}}. Low purchasing power {{means that the}} real income of the people is low, although in monetary terms it may be high. If the money income were low, the problem could easily be overcome by <b>expanding</b> the money supply; however, since the meaning {{in this context is}} real income, <b>expanding</b> the supply of money will only generate inflationary pressure. Neither real output nor real investment will rise. It is to be noted that a low purchasing power means that domestic demand for commodities is low. Apart from encompassing consumer goods and services, this includes the demand for capital as well.|$|E

40|$|Motivation: The {{ultimate}} goal of abbreviation management is to disambiguate every occurrence of an abbreviation into its <b>expanded</b> form (concept or sense). To collect <b>expanded</b> forms for abbreviations, previous studies have recognized abbreviations and their <b>expanded</b> forms in parenthetical expressions of bio-medical texts. However, <b>expanded</b> forms extracted by abbreviation recognition are mixtures of concepts/senses and their term variations. Consequently, a list of <b>expanded</b> forms should be structured into a sense inventory, which provides possible concepts or senses for abbreviation disambiguation...|$|R
