40|$|Several {{significant}} {{studies have}} been made in recent decades toward understanding road traffic noise and its effects on residential balconies. These previous studies have used a variety of techniques such as theoretical models, scale models and measurements on real balconies. The studies have considered either road traffic noise levels within the balcony space or inside an adjacent <b>habitable</b> <b>room</b> or both. Previous theoretical models have used, for example, simplified specular reflection calculations, boundary element methods (BEM), adaptations of CoRTN or the use of Sabine Theory. This paper presents an alternative theoretical model to predict the effects of road traffic noise spatially within the balcony space. The model includes a specular reflection component by calculating up to 10 orders of source images. To account for diffusion effects, a two compartment radiosity component is utilised. The first radiosity compartment is the urban street, represented as a street with building facades on either side. The second radiosity compartment is the balcony space. The model is designed to calculate the predicted road traffic noise levels within the balcony space and is capable of establishing the effect of changing street and balcony geometries.

40|$|During an {{intensive}} design-led workshop multidisciplinary design teams examined options for a sustainable multi-residential tower on an inner urban site in Brisbane (Australia). The main {{aim was to}} demonstrate the key principles of daylight to every <b>habitable</b> <b>room</b> and cross-ventilation to every apartment in the subtropical climate while responding to acceptable yield and price points. The four conceptual design proposals demonstrated {{a wide range of}} outcomes, with buildings ranging from 15 to 30 storeys. Daylight Factor (DF), view to the outside, and the avoidance of direct sunlight were the only quantitative and qualitative performance metrics used to implement daylighting to the proposed buildings during the charrette. This paper further assesses the daylighting performance of the four conceptual designs by utilizing Climate-based daylight modeling (CBDM), specifically Daylight Autonomy (DA) and Useful Daylight Illuminance (UDI). Results show that UDI 100 - 2000 lux calculations provide more useful information on the daylighting design than DF. The percentage of the space with a UDI < 100 - 2000 lux larger than 50 % ranged from 77 % to 86 % of the time for active occupant behaviour (occupancy from 6 am to 6 pm). The paper also highlights the architectural features that mostly affect daylighting design in subtropical climates...|$|E

The first aim of the project is to investigate and compare the indoor air quality (IAQ) performance and energy characteristics during the heating season of ten different mechanical ventilation solutions in dwellings that meet strict air-tightness standards and comply with current building regulations. The second goal is to further improve the ventilation systems on their IAQ-performance while minimizing their energy consumption. Over a full year 62 residential dwellings were monitored with, in each <b>habitable</b> <b>room,</b> sensors for occupancy, CO 2, relative humidity and air temperature. Power consumption of the mechanical ventilation units was also continuously monitored. The ventilation solutions included traditional mechanical exhaust ventilation or MEV systems (systems with mechanical exhaust in the wet rooms), state-of-the-art MEV systems (systems with mechanical exhaust in all rooms), {{as well as local}} and central balanced systems with heat recovery (MVHR-systems), with various types of controls. Although all systems under investigation comply with building codes, the data show that huge differences occur in both the IAQ and energy performance. CO 2 excess dose (above 1200 ppm) may vary per dwelling from 10 to 850 kppmh per person per heating season, resulting in a situation in which respectively 1 to approximately 85 % of the time spent at home, the ventilation is not sufficient in the room that one occupies. Real life primary energy consumption varies from 23 MJ/m 2 for centralized ventilation systems with heat recovery to 144 MJ/m 2 for traditional MEV-systems...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{high-rise}} residential apartments (HRRA) {{are developing}} very fast in major urban areas in Malaysia. However, the layouts of these apartment units {{seem to be}} too typical and lacking certain contextual socio-environmental considerations. A residential unit accommodates more than just rooms. There are distinct spaces with various Use-Territories (UTs) inside every room created by furniture layout. During the design stage, usually less importance is given to UTs. In search of their impact, the objectives {{of this study were}} firstly to identify the most popular furniture with their approximate dimensions, secondly to find their location in terms of distance from window, and thirdly, to identify typologies of furniture layouts in terms of UTs. Based on a questionnaire survey distributed among 98 HRRA residents in the city of Johor Bahru, the conceptual furnished plans of studied rooms were drawn. That was followed by a qualitative categorization carried out to extract the typologies of mostly-used UTs.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to develop}} a new daylight assessment method for high-rise residential buildings located in high-density urban environments. The new visible sky area (VSA) method was developed based on data gathered from an extensive survey of high-rise residential building plans and layouts in Hong Kong and followed by a large number of daylight simu- lation experiments. The results of simulations showed a very small daylight quantity arriving at windowpane of lower floor level of high-rise residential buildings due to high-obstruction from nearby buildings and also self-obstruction. The new method would guarantee the availability of sky area seen from windowpane in order to provide a good vertical daylight factor (VDF), which has been adopted as a performance-based daylight indicator in Hong Kong.

The additional rooms were served by a narrow winding stairway, easier to defend. The decision may have been made because of the growing conflict in Paris between the Burgundians and the Armagnacs. To provide support for the new upper floors, a narrow chamber nine meters high was created on the second floor, which had no evident purpose other than making the tower higher. The quality of stone in the newer parts of the tower was less than that in the original work. Gradually, the stairway tower rose to become higher than the building it originally served.|$|R
