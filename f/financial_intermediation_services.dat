If we take a microeconomic approach, consider only the institutional credit of <b>Financial</b> <b>Intermediation,</b> directed to commercial agriculture, and assume that the lender’s goal (Formal Credit Institution) and the borrower’s goal (farmer) is profit maximization, we can conclude that equilibrium always exists with credit rationing, {{as a result of}} the Formal Credit Institution when defining conditions to grant loans...|$|R

2500|$|The FairTax {{would be}} tax free on {{mortgage}} interest {{up to the}} basic interest rate {{as determined by the}} Federal Reserve. The interest above the basic rate applied by the lender is a <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation</b> <b>service</b> and is subject to the FairTax (on a typical home mortgage only about one-half of one percent of interest would be subject to tax). Several economic studies have estimated that switching from an income tax system to a consumption tax system such as the FairTax would result in an interest rate drop of approximately 25%. These changes would result in a decreased cost for home buyers. [...] As a comparison to the FairTax for encouraging home ownership, the current tax system would have to allow all taxpayers to fully deduct the purchase of used property against income and payroll taxes, expand the mortgage interest deduction so that it permits a deduction against payroll taxes, fully untax interest income to lenders and institutions, and fully untax returns on savings. [...] However, since several areas would be tax free under the FairTax plan, it could decrease the social incentive to spend more on homes in favor of savings, education, or other investments.|$|R

We then empirically test the model using balance-sheet data for large European and US banks, and find {{strong support for the}} main predictions of the model. Interest revenues and costs are in fact very persistent, and they are strongly influenced by revenues from fees, and industrial and default costs. Interest margins rise with both short and long-term interest rates; however, when splitting the sample, we find that the results for the impact of interest rates are driven by the European banks. Finally, we find evidence that interest margins are anti-cyclical. ...|$|R

40|$|I {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} hybrid intermediaries: financial conglomerates that control a multiplicity of entity types active in the "assembly line" process of modern <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation,</b> {{a system that has}} become known as shadow banking. The complex bank holding companies of today are the best example of hybrid intermediaries, but I argue that financial firms from the "nonbank" space can just as easily evolve into conglomerates with similar organizational structure, thus acquiring the capability to engage in <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation.</b> I document instances of the emergence and growth of such nonbank hybrid intermediaries. Notable nonbank firms (for example, from the investment banking or specialty lending sectors) that had become significant intermediaries and that turned into bank holding companies post-Lehman are, from an organizational standpoint, indistinguishable from firms with a traditional banking origin. Similar inference can be drawn by analyzing specific activities. I focus on securities lending, a well-understood example of shadow <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation,</b> and document the emergence of a firm from the asset management sector as one of the largest providers of related <b>intermediation</b> <b>services</b> globally...|$|R

40|$|<b>Financial</b> <b>intermediation</b> and <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> {{industries}} have undergone many {{changes in the}} past two decades due to deregulation, globalization, and technological advances. The framework for regulating finance has seen many changes as well, with approaches adapting to new issues arising in specific groups of countries or globally. The objectives of this paper are twofold: to review current international thinking on what regulatory framework is needed to develop a financial sector that is stable, yet efficient, and provides proper access to households and firms; and to review the key experiences regarding international financial architecture initiatives, with a special focus on issues arising for developing countries. The paper outlines a number of areas of current debate: the special role of banks, competition policy, consumer protection, harmonization of rules-across products, within markets, and globally-and the adaptation and legitimacy of international standards to the circumstances facing developing countries. It concludes with some areas where more research would be useful.

40|$|It {{is widely}} known that Muslim society {{inherited}} an interest based <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation</b> system from others instead of {{developing their own}} banking system.

During the last four decades, Islamic <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation</b> industry became a reality that the Muslim society around the world can see and practice.

40|$|The neoclassical growth {{model is}} {{extended}} to include costly intermediated {{borrowing and lending}} between households. This is an important extension as substantial resources are used in intermediating {{the large amount of}} borrowing and lending between households. In 2007, in the United States, the amount intermediated was 1. 7 times GNP, and the resources used in this intermediation amounted to at least 3. 4 percent of GNP.

40|$|Following the Tequila period, its after-effects in Latin America {{and recent}} events in South East Asia, {{the effect of}} {{volatility}} on emerging market economies has become an important topic of research with the domestic <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation</b> process being advanced {{as one of the}} most important transmission mechanisms. At the same time there has been continued interest in issues related to imperfect information and rationing in credit markets. In this paper, we consider an economy where risk neutral banks provide <b>intermediation</b> <b>services</b> and risk neutral producers demand credit to finance their working capital needs. Our model blends costly state verification with imperfect enforcement power and, in this context of costly <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation,</b> we show that a weak legal system combined with high information verification costs leads to large, first-order effects of volatility on production, employment and welfare. A calibration illustrates that the semi-elasticity of welfare with respect to volatility is less than - 1 for reasonable parameter values (i. e., a one percent increase in the coefficient of variation of productivity shocks would reduce welfare by more than one percent). We suggest that legal and information problems in the credit market may then be at the heart of the reason why volatility has profound effects on emerging market economies. ...|$|R
