5|$|After {{four years}} at tier two, Rosenborg joined the First Division in 1967 and won the league that season. Since, Rosenborg has only played the 1978 season at the second tier. The First Division was renamed the Norwegian Premier League in 1991. The club entered the cup {{for the first time}} in 1932, {{claiming}} its first title in 1960. Rosenborg has experienced two golden eras; the first in the 1960s and early 1970s resulted in three league and three cup honors, <b>in</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> equal number of runner-up positions in both tournaments. The second golden era started with winning the league in 1985 and has resulted in nineteen league and six cup titles. Fourteen league titles were claimed under manager Nils Arne Eggen and sixteen have been won by midfielder Roar Strand.|$|E
5|$|During period Q, Tell Brak was an {{important}} trade city in the Mitanni state. A two-story palace was built c. 1500 BC in the northern section of the tell, <b>in</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> associated temple. However, {{the rest of the}} tell was not occupied, and a lower town extended to the north but is now all but destroyed through modern agriculture. Two Mitannian legal documents, bearing the names of kings Artashumara and Tushratta, were recovered from the city, which was destroyed between c.1300 and 1275 BC, in two waves, first {{at the hands of the}} Assyrian king Adad-Nirari I, then by his successor Shalmaneser I.|$|E

5|$|Gliders {{are often}} {{launched}} using a stationary ground-based winch {{mounted on a}} heavy vehicle. This method is widely used at many European clubs, often <b>in</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> aerotow service. The engine is usually powered by LPG, petrol or diesel, though hydraulic fluid engines and electrical motors are also used. The winch pulls in a 1,000 to 2,500-metre (3,000 to 7,500ft) cable, made of high-tensile steel wire or a synthetic fiber, attached to the glider. The cable is released at a height of about 35% of the cable length after a short, steep ride. A strong headwind will result in higher launches.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of its target value and vulnerability, {{aircraft}} carriers are always escorted by at least one submarine for protection. The other vessels in the Strike Group provide additional capabilities, such as long range Tomahawk missiles or the Aegis Combat System, and also protect the carrier from attack. A typical Strike Group may include, <b>in</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> aircraft carrier: up to six surface combatants, including frigates (since retired from USN service), guided missile cruisers and guided missile destroyers (used primarily for anti-aircraft warfare and anti-submarine warfare); one or two attack submarines (for seeking out and destroying hostile surface ships and submarines); and an ammunition, oiler, and supply ship of Military Sealift Command to provide logistical support. The precise structure and numbers of each type of ship can vary between groups depending on the objectives of the deployment.|$|E
5|$|Norsk Air was a Norwegian airline {{based at}} Sandefjord Airport, Torp. At its height from the mid-1980s and onwards it {{operated}} scheduled flights to Stavanger, Bergen, Trondheim and Copenhagen, and for shorter periods also other Norwegian and international destinations. The airline had 156 employees and 150,000 annual passengers in 1989. The company was {{established as a}} sole proprietorship by Øyvind Skaunfelt as Vestfoldfly in 1961, after purchasing Thor Solberg's aviation school at Tønsberg Airport, Jarlsberg. <b>In</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> aviation college, the company operated various charter services using mostly Cessna aircraft. The company split into a flying school and an airline in 1972, with the latter taking the name Norsk Flytjeneste. Three 50-passenger Douglas DC-6 were subsequently bought and were among other places flown with aid charters to Bangladesh. Both the DC-6 and later charter flights with business jets proved unprofitable and were quickly terminated.|$|E

5|$|The Han {{court upheld}} a {{socio-economic}} ranking system for commoners and nobles, {{which was based}} on the twenty-ranks system installed by the statesman Shang Yang (d. 338 BCE) of the State of Qin. All males above the age of 15 (excluding slaves) could be promoted in rank up to level eight. When a commoner was promoted in rank, he was granted a more honorable place in the seating arrangements of hamlet banquets, was given a greater portion of hunted game at the table, was punished less severely for certain crimes, and could become exempt from labor service obligations to the state. This system favored the elderly, since a longer lifespan meant more opportunities to become promoted. <b>In</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> increase in salary (see table to the right), newly promoted men were granted wine and ox-meat for a celebratory banquet. The 19th and 20th ranks were both marquess ranks, yet only a 20th rank allowed one to have a marquessate fief.|$|E
5|$|The Joint Chiefs and CINCPAC {{turned down}} the concept, believing that it would consume the efforts of too many troops and create a {{logistical}} nightmare. McNamara, however, was intrigued. Ignoring the military chiefs, he approached the Institute for Defense Analyses and requested that it fund {{a study of the}} concept. The project was then handed over to the Jason Division (also referred to as the Jason Group or Jason Committee), a group of 67 scientists who were to study and develop the technology necessary to make the physical/electronic barrier feasible. The group concentrated its efforts in three key areas: communications; data processing and display; and sensor development. On 15 September 1966, McNamara made Army General Alfred D. Starbird the head of the newly formed Defense Communications Planning Group (DCPG), which was to oversee the implementation of the program. The barrier concept was then given the designation Practice Nine. The DCPG's original mission profile, as of September 1966, was simply to implement the anti-infiltration system devised by the Jason Division. The original plan foresaw the deployment of both a physical barrier <b>in</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> air-supported barrier using various electronic sensors.|$|E
5|$|The {{angle of}} Earth's axial tilt is {{relatively}} stable {{over long periods}} of time. Its axial tilt does undergo nutation; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6years. The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, precessing around in a complete circle over each 25,800year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface. This polar motion has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed quasiperiodic motion. <b>In</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the Chandler wobble. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a variety}} of ways to {{approach}} the game's situations: players can use a violent approach and shoot their way through environments while using cover to hide from enemy fire. Alternately, Adam can take a stealthy approach, avoiding guards and security devices, again using cover to avoid enemy sight lines. Adam can move between cover elements and around corners while staying hidden. The melee takedown system offers lethal and non-lethal options, <b>in</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> assortment of lethal and non-lethal weapons. Adam can also move the bodies of enemies into hiding places, preventing them from being seen and raising an alarm. A key part of Adam's abilities are augmentations, which can be acquired and upgraded using Praxis Kits either bought from special vendors, found in the game environments, or are automatically unlocked by leveling up: higher-level augmentations require more Praxis Kits to unlock. Augmentation functions can range from passive enhancements to Adam's vision or damage resistance, to active upgrades such as allowing Adam to fall from great heights without being injured or increase his strength. Some augmentations are dependent on Adam's energy level, deactivating after an amount of energy has been drained.|$|E
5|$|Other offices {{included}} the sworn clerks, the examiners, the clerk to the barons, and the clerk to the King's Remembrancer. There were eight sworn clerks, so called {{because they were}} sworn officers of the court, who held their offices for life and worked under the Remembrancer. Each clerk acted as {{an attorney for the}} parties in court, and every party was required to employ one. The first clerk was known as the First Secondary, and administered oaths out of the Red Book of the Exchequer. The sworn clerks were assisted by 24side clerks, of whom each sworn clerk appointed three. Each side clerk studied under a sworn clerk for five years before practising himself, although under the sworn clerk's name. A side clerk had the chance of being promoted to sworn clerk, first by the Remembrancer and then by the sworn clerks themselves. The examiners were tasked with supervising depositions of witnesses, bringing the witness to a Baron, administering the oath and keeping the files of the depositions. In 1624 it was decided these examiners should be sworn officers of the court, and from then on each Baron had an examiner, who acted in the Baron's name. The office of examiner was dissolved in 1841, when the equity jurisdiction of the Exchequer came to an end. <b>In</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> examiner, each Baron had at least one clerk, who acted as their private secretary; although not paid, they were authorised to take fees for their work. The Chief Baron had two clerks, while the puisne Barons had one each. The King's Remembrancer also employed a clerk, who was also a secretary. He received no salary and was not a sworn officer of the court, meaning the Remembrancer could have him replaced at any time.|$|E
