5|$|In mathematics, {{particularly}} {{algebraic topology}} and homology theory, the Mayer–Vietoris sequence is an algebraic tool to help compute algebraic invariants of topological spaces, known as their homology and cohomology groups. The result {{is due to}} two Austrian mathematicians, Walther Mayer and Leopold Vietoris. The method consists of splitting a space into subspaces, for which the homology or cohomology groups may be easier to compute. The sequence relates the (co)homology groups of the space to the (co)homology groups of the subspaces. It is a natural long exact sequence, whose <b>entries</b> <b>are</b> the (co)homology groups of the whole space, the direct sum of the (co)homology groups of the subspaces, and the (co)homology groups of {{the intersection of the}} subspaces.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the first}} {{installment}} was released in 1995, the Tales series has grown to include the main entries and multiple spin-offs that derive multiple gameplay and narrative elements from the main entries. Except when indicated by naming, the main Tales <b>entries</b> <b>are</b> separate from each other apart from gameplay mechanics and themes. While Tales titles are often ported to new consoles after their original release, these remakes are rarely localized. The 2006 Nintendo DS game Tales of the Tempest was originally seen as a main entry in the series, but in 2007 was classified as a spin-off, possibly due to poor reception of that particular title.|$|E
5|$|Spanning 468 pages, Spin Alternative Record Guide compiles {{essays by}} 64 music critics on {{recording}} artists and bands who either predated, were involved in, or {{developed from the}} alternative music movement. In the book, each artist's entry is accompanied by their discography, with albums rated a score between one and ten. The book's editors, critic Eric Weisbard and Spin editor-in-chief Craig Marks, consulted journalists such as Simon Reynolds, Alex Ross, Charles Aaron, Michael Azerrad, Ann Powers, and Rob Sheffield, who wrote most of the complete discography reviews. The artist <b>entries</b> <b>are</b> also accompanied by song lyrics and album artwork.|$|E
5|$|Stochastic {{matrices}} are square matrices whose rows are probability vectors, that is, whose <b>entries</b> <b>are</b> non-negative and sum up to one. Stochastic matrices {{are used}} to define Markov chains with finitely many states. A row of the stochastic matrix gives the probability distribution for the next position of some particle currently in the state that corresponds to the row. Properties of the Markov chain like absorbing states, that is, states that any particle attains eventually, can be read off the eigenvectors of the transition matrices.|$|E
5000|$|As a {{more general}} notion, a matrix where every <b>entry</b> <b>is</b> either 0, 1 or -1 is called {{balanced}} if in every submatrix with two nonzero entries per row and column, {{the sum of the}} <b>entries</b> <b>is</b> a multiple of 4.|$|R
