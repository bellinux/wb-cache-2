5|$|Along crater and canyon walls, {{there are}} {{thousands}} of features that appear similar to terrestrial <b>gullies.</b> The <b>gullies</b> tend to be in the highlands of the southern hemisphere and to face the Equator; all are poleward of 30° latitude. A number of authors have suggested that their formation process involves liquid water, probably from melting ice, although others have argued for formation mechanisms involving carbon dioxide frost or the movement of dry dust. No partially degraded <b>gullies</b> have formed by weathering and no superimposed impact craters have been observed, indicating that these are young features, possibly still active. Other geological features, such as deltas and alluvial fans preserved in craters, are further evidence for warmer, wetter conditions at an interval or intervals in earlier Mars history. Such conditions necessarily require the widespread presence of crater lakes across {{a large proportion of the}} surface, for which there is independent mineralogical, sedimentological and geomorphological evidence.|$|E
5|$|Casualties {{were around}} 2,000, {{as the men}} were {{subjected}} to fire from the cliffs above. Problems clearing the beach of obstructions led to the beachmaster calling a halt to further landings of vehicles at 08:30. A group of destroyers arrived around this time to provide fire support so landings could resume. Exit from the beach was possible only via five heavily defended <b>gullies,</b> and by late morning barely 600 men had reached the higher ground. By noon, as the artillery fire took its toll and the Germans started {{to run out of}} ammunition, the Americans were able to clear some lanes on the beaches. They also started clearing the <b>gullies</b> of enemy defences so that vehicles could move off the beach. The tenuous beachhead was expanded over the following days, and the D-Day objectives for Omaha were accomplished by D+3.|$|E

50|$|The {{suburb of}} Upper Ferntree <b>Gully</b> is often {{referred}} to by residents simply as Upper <b>Gully.</b> Many years ago, Ferntree <b>Gully</b> was known as Lower Ferntree Gully—there was a Lower <b>Gully</b> and an Upper <b>Gully.</b> Upper Ferntree <b>Gully</b> {{has been part of the}} Shire of Fern Tree <b>Gully,</b> Shire of Sherbrooke, Shire of Yarra Ranges (after the realignment of municipal boundaries), but now most of it is in the City of Knox.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Although {{the number}} of {{publications}} on <b>gully</b> erosion has increased over the last decade, there are still various as-pects of <b>gully</b> erosion that deserve more research efforts. Some of these, discussed in this contribution, are <b>gully</b> erosion in historical times, measuring techniques, processes of <b>gully</b> initiation, development and infilling, the interaction between <b>gully</b> erosion with hydrological and other soil degradation processes (e. g. piping, landsliding, tillage erosion and erosion induced by land levelling), <b>gully</b> erosion models, effective and efficient <b>gully</b> prevention and control measures. A better understand-ing of these aspects would allow one to better predict the impact of environmental change, <b>gully</b> prevention and control mea-sures on <b>gully</b> erosion and <b>gully</b> infilling rates at a range of temporal and spatial scales and for various types of environments, {{and the effects of}} <b>gully</b> erosion on sediment yield, hydrological process intensities and landscape evolution...|$|R
5|$|Pitted terrain {{has been}} {{observed}} in four craters on Vesta: Marcia, Cornelia, Numisia and Licinia. The formation of the pitted terrain is proposed to be degassing of impact-heated volatile-bearing material. Along with the pitted terrain, curvilinear <b>gullies</b> are found in Marcia and Cornelia craters. The curvilinear <b>gullies</b> end in lobate deposits, which are sometimes covered by pitted terrain, and are proposed to form by the transient flow of liquid water after buried deposits of ice were melted by {{the heat of the}} impacts. Hydrated materials have also been detected, many of which are associated with areas of dark material. Consequently, dark material is thought to be largely composed of carbonaceous chondrite, which was deposited on the surface by impacts. Carbonaceous chondrites are comparatively rich in mineralogically bound OH.|$|E
5|$|Traversing a {{crossroads}} at night was considered dangerous {{because it was}} the place and time of the ala’s supper; the unfortunate person who stepped on an “ala’s table” could become blind, deaf, or lame. Ale gather at night on the eves of greater holidays, divert men from their ways into <b>gullies,</b> and torture them there by riding them like horses.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the forest}} habitat, the red-winged fairywren prefers wetter <b>gullies</b> and {{riverside}} sword sedge (Lepidosperma effusum). It borders {{the range of}} the variegated fairywren on the northern limit of its range, and the blue-breasted fairywren in the eastern limit, with the latter two species occupying dryer scrub while the red-winged fairywren is restricted to wetter forests. The lack of intermediate forms reinforces the status of all three taxa as separate species.|$|E

5|$|Ben Nevis is {{becoming}} popular with ski mountaineers and boarders. The Red Burn (Allt Coire na h-Urcaire) {{just to the}} North of the tourist path gives the easiest descent, but {{most if not all}} of the easier <b>gullies</b> on the North Face have been skied, as has the slope once adorned by the abseil poles into Coire Leis. No 4 gully is probably the most skied. Although Tower scoop makes it a no-fall zone, Tower Gully {{is becoming}} popular, especially in May and June when there is spring snow.|$|E
5|$|B.brownii occurs between Albany (35°S) and the Stirling Range (34°24'S) in the {{southwest}} of Western Australia, at the juncture of the Esperance Plains, Warren and Jarrah Forest biogeographic regions. This is the taxonomically richest area for Banksia, with 19 species, of which six are endemic, including B.brownii itself. It is cool and wet, with temperatures between four and 30°C (39–86°F) and rainfall of around 800 millimetres (31in). The species occurs there in two distinct population clusters: southern populations occur among low woodland of Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah) in shallow, nutrient-poor white or grey sand over laterite; Stirling Range populations occur at altitudes of between 500 and 1100 metres (1640–3960ft), among heath on rocky mountain slopes and tops, and in shale in <b>gullies.</b>|$|E
5|$|B.brownii usually grows as {{an upright}} bush {{between one and}} three metres (3–10ft) high, {{but it can also}} grow as an openly {{branched}} small tree to six metres (20ft) in sheltered <b>gullies,</b> or as a low, spreading shrub in exposed locations such as the peaks of the Stirling Range. The bark is a grey-brown colour, smooth and thin, with lenticels. The leaves are long and thin, from three to ten centimetres (1–5in) long, and five to ten millimetres (–in) wide. Dark green and hairless above but with a hairy white underside, they are easily recognised by their feather-like appearance, caused {{by the fact that they}} are finely divided almost back to the midrib, into as many as 70 thin tapered lobes.|$|E
40|$|Analysis of {{contemporary}} and past <b>gully</b> erosion and infilling processes allowed {{to reconstruct the}} long-term evolution of a permanent <b>gully</b> system under cropland. An active and a buried <b>gully</b> under cropland were investigated. The recent sediment deposits within the active <b>gully,</b> adjacent to the buried <b>gully,</b> showed that the recent <b>gully</b> was filling in at a mean rate of 6. 4 cm a(- 1). In the buried <b>gully,</b> several erosion and deposition phases could be identified {{and the type of}} deposited sediments revealed a complex infilling history. Charcoal, pottery and brick fragments of different sizes were found at all depths of the <b>gully</b> infilling. Their age indicates that the first <b>gully</b> incised after the midst of the 17 th century, most probably {{in the second half of}} the 18 th century or the early 19 th century. <b>Gully</b> morphology and analogy with the processes in the recent <b>gully</b> indicate that the buried <b>gully</b> filled in rapidly. Overall, five cycles of cut and fill occurred in 350 years or less and four cycles even within little less than a few decades, indicating that <b>gully</b> development and infilling under cropland can be very rapid processes.

5|$|Classic {{examples}} are {{found at the}} Banff townsite proper: Mount Rundle is a classic dip slope mountain. Just {{to the north of}} the Banff townsite, Castle Mountain is composed of numerous Cambrian age rock formations. The uppermost section of the peak consists of relatively harder dolomite from the Eldon Formation. Below that lies the less dense shales of the Stephen Formation and the lowest exposed cliffs are limestones of the Cathedral Formation. Dogtooth mountains, such as Mount Louis, exhibit sharp, jagged slopes. The Sawback Range, which consists of nearly vertical dipping sedimentary layers, has been eroded by cross <b>gullies.</b> The erosion of these almost vertical layers of rock strata in the Sawback Range has resulted in formations that appear like the teeth on a saw blade. Erosion and deposition of higher elevation rock layers has resulted in scree deposits at the lowest elevations of many of the mountains.|$|E
5|$|Formation of {{approximately}} the current {{depth of the}} Colorado River's Grand Canyon by 1.2 mya further caused its tributaries to cut down even deeper. Headward erosion {{of one of those}} tributaries, the Paria River, eroded north-northwestward toward what is now Paria Amphitheater. The river took a route roughly parallel to and east of the Paunsaugunt Fault. Erosion from snow and rain that fall directly on the east-facing rim of the Paunsaugunt Plateau forms <b>gullies</b> that widen into alcoves and amphitheaters while differential erosion and frost wedging create the hoodoos. Streams on the plateau do not contribute to the formation of alcoves or amphitheaters because they flow away from the rim. Erosion continues in this fashion today.|$|E
5|$|In August 1942 No. 3 Commando was {{involved}} in the ill-fated Operation Jubilee, an exploratory raid on Dieppe in France. The plan called for a frontal assault on the port by the Canadian 2nd Division. Before this would take place, however, Troops from No. 3 and 4 Commandos would land at beaches on the eastern and western flanks and neutralise two German artillery batteries that were covering the main anchorage. No. 3 Commando was assigned the task of attacking the Goebbels Battery, landing on the eastern flank, under Durnford-Slater's command. The battery was located near Berneval-le-Grand, about half a mile from the sea with steep cliffs in front of it. It was decided that No. 3 Commando would land on two beaches to the east and west of the battery, from which <b>gullies</b> rose towards the battery and which would provide concealment while the Commandos approached the battery.|$|E

5|$|The black currawong is {{generally}} found in wetter eucalypt forests, dominated by such species as alpine ash (Eucalyptus delegatensis), messmate (E.obliqua), and mountain gum (E.dalrympleana), sometimes with a beech (Nothofagus) understory. It also frequents cool rainforest of beech, king billy pine (Athrotaxis selaginoides). In lowlands {{it is more}} restricted to denser forests and moist <b>gullies,</b> while it also occurs in alpine scrubland and heathland at altitude. In dryer more open forest, it is replaced by the clinking currawong, although the two may co-occur {{in places such as}} the Central Highlands and Eastern Tiers. Both the Flinders and King island subspecies are found across their respective islands, but prefer more forested habitats there. The black currawong has been recorded in gardens in Hobart in Tasmania's southeast, and around Mount Wellington, on Hobart's outskirts, in winter. Some remained to breed in Hobart in 1994 after a year of severe weather.|$|E
5|$|Locally heavy {{flooding}} {{was reported}} in Tuxpan. Streets were inundated and power outages occurred, while more than 500people lost their homes. The Tuxpan River overflowed its banks at Álamo. A local Red Cross official stated {{that most of the}} town was submerged in only a few minutes. About 5,000homes were flooded by September3, forcing approximately 30,000people to flee. Additional flooding in the town resulted in about 8,000people being left homeless. In Poza Rica, downed tree trunks and trash caused water runoffs to be blocked. Mud and rocks blocked roads and dozens were rescued from house and car flooding. A number of homes built along the <b>gullies</b> were washed away. The Cazones River overflowed, rendering a highway connecting Tampico to Veracruz impassable. The Cotaxtla River exceeded its bank in Cotaxtla, rupturing nine oil and natural gas lines. Pemex works quickly closed the pipelines. In Mexico City, about 600people fled for shelter as rivers in the area began to swell. Ramón Aguirre Velázquez, the Head of Government of Mexico City, described the rainfall as the heaviest in 20years.|$|E
