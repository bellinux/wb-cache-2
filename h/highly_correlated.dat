5|$|C. c. coronoides, the {{nominate}} or eastern subspecies, {{is found}} across most of eastern Australia. Its range is also <b>highly</b> <b>correlated</b> {{with the presence}} of sheep. This is thought to be because of the frequency of dead animals, which can be an important source of food. Ornithologist Ian Rowley held that the eastern subspecies was expanding eastwards before European colonisation, and that this suggested it was of younger origin than the western subspecies, which appears static. The advent of agriculture facilitated further spread.|$|E
5|$|Fine-mapping {{requires}} all variants in {{the associated}} region {{to have been}} genotyped or imputed (dense coverage), very stringent quality control resulting in high-quality genotypes, and large sample sizes sufficient in separating out <b>highly</b> <b>correlated</b> signals. There are several different methods to perform fine-mapping, and all methods produce a posterior probability that a variant in that locus is causal. Because the requirements are often difficult to satisfy, there are still limited examples of these methods being more generally applied.|$|E
5|$|In chapter nine, Marita's Bargain, Gladwell {{advances}} {{the notion}} that the success of students of different cultures or different socio-economic backgrounds is in fact <b>highly</b> <b>correlated</b> to the time students spent in school or in educationally rich environments. He describes the Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP) which helps students from about 50 inner-city schools across the United States achieve much better results than other inner-city schools' students and explains that their success {{stems from the fact that}} they simply spent more hours at school during the school year and the summer. Gladwell also analyzes a five-year study done by Karl Alexander of Johns Hopkins University, demonstrating that summer holidays have a detrimental effect on students of disadvantaged backgrounds, who paradoxically progress more during the school year than students from the highest socio-economic group.|$|E

30|$|By their {{construction}} in psychology, the Big-Five personality traits {{are supposed to}} be uncorrelated [3]. However, as Vinciarelli notes in [4], this is not often the case as raters’ cognitive and cultural biases tend to create correlations among traits while annotating. In addition, personality traits that can be observed in group settings such as emergent leadership and dominance <b>highly</b> <b>correlate</b> with the Big-Five personality traits, in particular with extraversion. To handle such correlation when building predictive models, we explore the usage of a multi-task learning (MTL) framework to search for a combination of tasks and features that <b>highly</b> <b>correlate</b> with the leadership and extraversion traits of humans.|$|R

40|$|Non-small cell {{lung cancer}} (NSCLC) {{represents}} a genomically unstable cancer type with extensive copy number aberrations. The relationship of gene copy number alterations and subsequent mRNA levels has only fragmentarily been described. The {{aim of this}} study was to conduct a genome-wide analysis of gene copy number gains and corresponding gene expression levels in a clinically well annotated NSCLC patient cohort (n = 190) and their association with survival. While more than half of all analyzed gene copy number-gene expression pairs showed statistically significant correlations (10, 296 of 18, 756 genes), high correlations, with a correlation coefficient > 0. 7, were obtained only in a subset of 301 genes (1. 6 %), including KRAS, EGFR and MDM 2. Higher correlation coefficients were associated with higher copy number and expression levels. Strong correlations were frequently based on few tumors with high copy number gains and correspondingly increased mRNA expression. Among the <b>highly</b> <b>correlating</b> genes, GO groups associated with posttranslational protein modifications were particularly frequent, including ubiquitination and neddylation. In a meta-analysis including 1, 779 patients we found that survival associated genes were overrepresented among <b>highly</b> <b>correlating</b> genes (61 of the 301 <b>highly</b> <b>correlating</b> genes, FDR adjusted p< 0. 05). Among them are the chaperone CCT 2, the core complex protein NUP 107 and the ubiquitination and neddylation associated protein CAND 1. In conclusion, in a comprehensive analysis we described a distinct set of <b>highly</b> <b>correlating</b> genes. These genes were found to be overrepresented among survival-associated genes based on gene expression in a large collection of publicly available datasets...|$|R

Meanwhile, the resulting regressions were compared with the results {{based on the}} well-established Randic and newly reported Xu indices and, in most cases, better results were obtained by the Sh index. Moreover, multiple linear regression analysis of the alkane properties via calculated indices gives <b>highly</b> <b>correlating</b> models with low standard errors...|$|R

Information retrieval systems aim to retrieve precise and relevant information {{in response to}} a user's query. In past years entire documents which were considered to be relevant or <b>highly</b> <b>correlating</b> were returned to users.

It also gives an overview of the process of generating <b>highly</b> <b>correlating</b> elements (from a large document collection) for a set of queries. The aim of this thesis is to improve the results for the INEX 2009 and 2010 Ad Hoc Focused Tasks. The Focused Tasks require that each query return a result set of non-overlapping elements.
