5|$|In archaeology, {{the study}} of {{mortuary}} context, that is, {{the interpretation of the}} postmortem treatment of the dead, whether an <b>individual</b> <b>or</b> as pertains to patterns within a group, has {{led to the development of}} hypotheses on social status and/or hierarchy regarding many cultures, ancient and extant. In addition, the determination of whether or not delivery actually occurred prior to death has a bearing on analyses of the mother's population, as the concentration of trace elements differ markedly between the skeletons of prepartum adult women (before giving birth) and women who are lactating; the identification of coffin birth would lead to more accurate analyses of the number of lactating women in a population or the rate of maternal mortality. It is therefore necessary for investigators to be able to recognize postmortem fetal extrusion when encountered in an excavated burial.|$|E
5|$|Langdon Brown Gilkey {{explained}} religious {{language and}} experience in terms of symbolism, identifying three characteristic features of religious symbolism which distinguish it from other language use.

Finally, he argued that religious symbols provide standards by which life should be lived.|$|E
5|$|Marx's {{thoughts}} on labour {{were related to}} the primacy he gave to the economic relation in determining the society's past, present and future (see also economic determinism). Accumulation of capital shapes the social system. For Marx, social change was about conflict between opposing interests, driven in the background by economic forces. This became the inspiration for the body of works known as the conflict theory. In his evolutionary model of history, he argued that human history began with free, productive and creative work that was over time coerced and dehumanised, a trend most apparent under capitalism. Marx noted that this was not an intentional process, rather no <b>individual</b> <b>or</b> even state can go against the forces of economy.|$|E

5|$|Medical {{diagnosis}} of the onset of HD can be made following the appearance of physical symptoms specific to the disease.

Genetic counseling is available to provide advice and guidance throughout the testing procedure, and on the implications of a confirmed diagnosis. These implications include the impact on an individual's psychology, career, family planning decisions, relatives and relationships. Despite the availability of pre-symptomatic testing, only 5% of those at risk of inheriting HD choose to do so.|$|E
5|$|Most {{mutations}} within {{genes are}} neutral, having {{no effect on}} the organism's phenotype (silent mutations). Some mutations do not change the amino acid sequence because multiple codons encode the same amino acid (synonymous mutations). Other mutations can be neutral if they lead to amino acid sequence changes, but the protein still functions similarly with the new amino acid (e.g. conservative mutations). Many mutations, however, are deleterious or even lethal, and are removed from populations by natural selection. Genetic disorders are the result of deleterious mutations and can be due to spontaneous mutation in the affected <b>individual,</b> <b>or</b> can be inherited. Finally, a small fraction of mutations are beneficial, improving the organism's fitness and are extremely important for evolution, since their directional selection leads to adaptive evolution.|$|E
