40|$|Bearing setting has a {{significant}} impact on bearing life and system performance. A strain based load measurement technique that has been previously developed and patented will be used to measure preload in automotive <b>drive</b> axle <b>pinion</b> <b>bearings.</b> This technique utilizes strain gages placed in notches that have been machined into the outer diameter of a bearing cup. The performance of two gage types, semiconductor and metal foil, are compared. Preload in the <b>pinion</b> <b>bearings</b> is simulated in a machine by applying an axial load to a bearing assembly. The bearing assembly is rotated at various speeds and temperatures for each set of axial loads. Two notch geometries are compared for each set of tests conducted. An effort has been made to develop a finite element model {{that can be used to}} verify the results of the gage calibration. The results of the calibration reveal that metal foil and semiconductor gages can provide preload measurements that are accurate to within 3. 7 % and 7. 7 % of the full scale input load (73 lbs. and 155 lbs.) respectively. by Anthony H.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to present an {{inductance}} measurement method, and an electromechanical model of the pinion-engaging mechanism for the starter motors.

40|$|AbstractThe goal of {{this paper}} is to model electro-dynamically the pinion-engaging {{mechanism}} (PEM) of starter motors. The purpose of the PEM is to switch a high current by means of relatively low control current. The PEM is the system of components (solenoid switch, pinion-engaging lever, and overrunning clutch with <b>drive</b> <b>pinion)</b> that engages the <b>drive</b> <b>pinion</b> with the ring gear. The solenoid switches consist of a pull-in winding and a hold-in winding and a movable iron core. The electro-dynamic model of the solenoid switch contains the inductance and its partial derivatives which depend on the current and the position of the solenoid armature. An electromechanical measurement method is proposed to determine the inductance and its derivative for various positions of the solenoid switch. The experimental results are implemented in the electro-dynamic model using energy-based modeling applying the Euler-Lagrange formalism...|$|R

50|$|Finally, (as {{described}} {{within the}} abstract for US Patent 5257535), if the mechanical system involves {{a right angle}} gearbox, then the axial reaction force experienced by the inputting shaft/pinion {{can be related to}} the torque experienced by the output shaft(s). The axial input stress must first be calibrated against the output torque. The input stress can be easily measured via strain gauge measurement of the input <b>pinion</b> <b>bearing</b> housing.

5000|$|The {{geometry}} of the rack system has a large impact {{on the construction of}} turnouts. If the rack is elevated above the running rails, {{there is no need to}} interrupt the running rails to allow passage of the driving pinions of the engines. Strub explicitly documented this in his U.S. patent. [...] Strub used a complex set of bell-cranks and push-rods linking the throw-rod for the points to the two throw-rods for the moving rack sections. One break in the rack was required to select between the two routes, and a second break was required where the rack rails cross the running rails. Turnouts for the Morgan Rack system were similar, with the rack elevated above the running rails. Most of the Morgan turnout patents included movable rack sections to avoid breaks in the rack, but because all Morgan locomotives had two linked <b>drive</b> <b>pinions,</b> there was no need for a continuous rack. So long as the breaks in the rack were shorter than the distance between the <b>drive</b> <b>pinions</b> on the locomotive, the rack rail could be interrupted wherever there was need to cross over a running rail.|$|R
50|$|The first {{design was}} {{produced}} from 1973 to 1984. The first design remained unchanged until 1986. This design had drums that were held {{on by the}} wheel studs and had a smaller diameter <b>pinion</b> <b>bearing</b> than the second design. The second design was produced from 1986 to present. One change {{that occurred in the}} second design was that on some models the brake drum could be removed without having to remove the hub and axle shaft. Additionally, the pinion received a larger diameter <b>bearing</b> while the <b>pinion</b> stayed the same diameter, which increased the durability of the pinion. All these axle are full floating.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{stabilize}} the yaw bearing against rotation a means of braking is necessary. One of the simplest ways to realize that task is to apply a constant small counter-torque at the yaw drives in order to eliminate the backlash between gear-rim and yaw <b>drive</b> <b>pinions</b> and to prevent the nacelle from oscillating due to the rotor rotation. This operation however greatly reduces {{the reliability of the}} electric yaw drives, therefore the most common solution is the implementation of a hydraulically actuated disk brake.|$|R

While the aircraft was overflying France, the flightdeck crew noticed a {{defect in the}} no. 4 engine and decided to make an emergency landing at the nearest diversion airfield. This resulted in a crash landing at Pithiviers. Although the aircraft was damaged beyond repair, there were no fatalities among the 70 occupants (six crew and 64 passengers). The evidence at the crash site seemed to suggest that an internal failure occurred inside the no. 4 engine, which caused over-speeding and subsequent disintegration of the reduction gear <b>pinion</b> <b>bearing.</b>|$|R

50|$|Where a steam barring {{engine was}} used, {{this was a}} small {{twin-cylinder}} engine (to avoid its own dead centre problems) with a reduction gear of high ratio, usually involving a worm gear. Final drive was by a pinion gear engaging temporarily with the teeth or barring holes cut into {{the rim of the}} main flywheel. The <b>drive</b> <b>pinion</b> was arranged on a swinging link so that it was thrown out-of-mesh automatically, once the main engine started to rotate at full speed. As the ratio was perhaps 1000:1 and the main engine ran at 60 rpm, this would otherwise have been a disastrous overspeed. Some engines instead used a final pinion on a helical spline, similar to that later used for the starters of internal combustion engines: once the main engine started, the pinion would be thrown out of engagement axially along this spline as the flywheel over-speeded the pinion relative to the shaft.|$|R
