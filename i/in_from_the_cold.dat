Hymir tells him to go get some bait from his pasture, which he expects should not be a problem for Thor. Thor goes out, finds Hymir's best ox, and rips its head off.|$|E

He played the Roman orator Cicero and was hired on an eight-week contract which due to various setbacks, including cast sickness and adverse weather conditions, was extended to nine months.

The 2002 {{election of}} the AKP, described as a “moderate Islamist party”, has challenged Turkey’s secular identity. In the more than twelve years since the AKP has been in power, Turkey’s political landscape has experienced significant changes, with periods of extensive democratic reforms punctuated by regression in certain areas, notably freedom of expression {{and the right to}} protest. State repressive measures coupled with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s reluctance to exit the political stage have been the focus of much commentary and analysis. This article argues, however, that under AKP rule the Kurdish issue – critical to ensuring the normalization of politics and democratization in Turkey – has been brought <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> political <b>cold</b> and assesses <b>the</b> creation and role of the HDP (Halkların Demokratik Partisi), a Kurdish political party that is endeavoring to situate itself in the mainstream of Turkey’s political landscape.

These genes included various glycoside hydrolases, nitrate and sulfate reductases, putative bacterial microcompartment biosynthetic clusters (BMC), and F 420 H 2 dehydrogenases.

Metatranscriptomics illustrated that glycoside hydrolases are among the most highly expressed genes.

2500|$|After Hamlet {{came to a}} {{close in}} August 1964, Burton and Taylor {{continued}} making films together. The first film after their marriage, The Sandpiper, was poorly received but still became a commercially successful venture. According to Bragg, the films they made during the mid-1960s contained a lot of innuendos that referred directly to their private lives. Burton went on to star opposite Claire Bloom and Oskar Werner in The Spy Who Came <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> (1965), a Cold War espionage story about a British Intelligence agent, Alec Leamas (Burton), who is sent to East Germany on a mission to find and expose a mole working within his organisation for an East German Intelligence officer, Hans-Dieter Mundt (Peter van Eyck). Martin Ritt, the film's director and producer, wanted Burton's character to exhibit more anonymity, which meant no display of eloquent speeches or intense emotional moments. Bragg believed this decision worried Burton, as he had generated his reputation as an actor with those exact traits, and wondered how the film's would turn out. Ritt, a non-drinker, was displeased with Burton's drinking habits as he felt it [...] "lacked a certain discipline" [...] and expected the same level of commitment from him as everyone else during filming. In spite of their differences, Alpert notes that the film transpired well. Based on the 1963 novel of the same name by John le Carré, The Spy Who Came <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> garnered positive reviews, with Fernando F. Croce of Slant Magazine describing Burton's performance as more of [...] "tragic patsy than swashbuckler" [...] and believed his scenes with Werner [...] "have sharp doses of suspicion, cynicism and sadness". Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader called the film [...] "Grim, monotonous, and rather facile", he found Burton's role had [...] "some honest poignancy". Variety thought Burton fitted [...] "neatly into the role of the apparently burned out British agent". Burton also made a brief appearance the same year in Clive Donner's comedy What's New Pussycat? as a man who meets the womaniser Michael James (O'Toole) in a bar.|$|E

40|$|High {{efficiencies}} {{of active}} magnetic regenerative r frigerators (AMRR) are strongly {{dependent on the}} correct selection of the magnetic regenerator working material. The selection process involves the thermodynamic analysis of the AMRR cycle to determine the adiabatic temperature change profile (AT versus 7 ") over the temperature span of interest for an ideal material, and then the matching of real materials whose magnetocaloric effect (MCE) {{as a function of}} absolute temperature best fits this profile. This paper develops the calculation of the ideal magnetic material AT versus T profile for a real AMRR operating between 110 and 300 K and with 1 kW of cooling power. The ideal profile was a function of the constant entropy flux <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> end heat load, the irreversible regenerator entropy production, and other real effects. To accommodate he large temperature span, several magnetic materials were chosen and layered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> regenerator <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> to <b>the</b> hot end by increasing the Curie temperature. The resultant AT versus T curve of the combined material provided only a rough approximation of the calculated ideal material curve. To improve this approximation, physical mixing of magnetic refrigerants was investigated. This procedure diluted the magnetic moment, thereby reducing magnetic entropy available for the cycle. Further, under adiabatic onditions, mixing produced an intolerable amount of entropy during cycle execution. Simple segmentation f the regenerator with more magnetic materials that better match the ideal profile is an easier way to approximate he ideal AT versus T curve with real materials. Optimum segmentation will be determined by regenerator complexity. 1...|$|R
