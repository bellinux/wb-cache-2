25|$|In 1959, Cruyff's {{father died}} from a heart attack. His father's death had {{a major impact on}} his mentality. As Cruyff recalled, in celebration of his 50th birthday, “My father died when I was just 12 and he was 45. From that day the feeling crept {{stronger}} over me that I would die at the same age and, when I had serious heart problems when I reached 45, I thought: 'This is it.' Only medical science, which was not available to <b>help</b> <b>my</b> father, kept me alive.” Viewing a potential football career as a way of paying tribute to his father, the death inspired the strong-willed Cruyff, who also frequently visited the burial site at Oosterbegraafplaats. His mother began working at Ajax as a cleaner, deciding that she could no longer carry on at the grocer without her husband, and in the future, this made Cruyff near-obsessed with financial security but also gave him an appreciation for player aids. His mother soon met her second husband, Henk Angel, a field hand at Ajax who proved a key influence in Cruyff's life.|$|E

500|$|Starting at the {{beginning}} of July 1992, Gaven appeared in a new musical called The Who's Tommy at La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego. It was based on the rock opera album Tommy by The Who. Gaven starred as Mrs. Walker, the mother of the boy Tommy who is traumatized when he sees his father murder Mrs. Walker's new boyfriend. Tommy ultimately becomes non-responsive, leading people to believe that he is deaf, mute, and blind, and his parents try to find a cure for his condition. Gaven later told TheaterWeek that she initially did not want to do the musical, since she [...] "had no idea how this could be staged as a theatrical piece. I hoped my agents wouldn't call me and ask me to audition." [...] However, they did, and she was cast as Mrs. Walker after an audition in which she sang the song [...] "Heaven <b>Help</b> <b>My</b> Heart" [...] that she performed in Chess, also a rock musical. The Who's Tommy was La Jolla Playhouse's biggest success yet and as a result its run was lengthened by several weeks. Later that year, Gaven once again played Doris in Here's Love—this time in a Theatre Under The Stars production.|$|E

Additionally, “God Help the Outcasts” [...] "touches on a basic idea behind most faiths." [...] Asking [...] "was Jesus [...] not an outcast, too, as [...] sees firsthand how her people, are persecuted for their differences," [...] the first verse of the song reads, [...] "I don't know if You can hear me/Or if You're even there/I don't know if You would listen/To a gypsy's prayer." [...] Teen Ink observed, [...] "This part is about how it seems like God doesn't listen to you or help you, {{no matter how much}} you pray or talk to him." [...] Finally, asking people to be kind and unselfish, Esmeralda sings, [...] "Please <b>help</b> <b>my</b> people, the poor and downtrodden/I thought we all were the children of God.” In The Gospel According to Disney, author Mark I. Pinsky drew similarities between [...] "God Help the Outcasts" [...] and the Christian hymn [...] "His Eye Is on the Sparrow," [...] as both songs explore [...] "the love of God that knows no bounds."

500|$|Disney had {{originally}} considered casting actress Jodi Benson, who famously voiced Ariel in The Little Mermaid, as Belle, but ultimately {{felt that she}} sounded [...] "too American" [...] and young, opting for a [...] "more classical ... womanly" [...] voice instead. Describing the character as [...] "a woman that was ahead of her time," [...] the filmmakers wanted Belle to sound [...] "more like a woman than a girl." [...] However, Benson voiced Belle in a few episodes of Disney's House of Mouse. Director Kirk Wise was particularly interested in casting an actress capable of [...] "creat a character completely with her voice", envisioning a voice {{similar to that of}} American entertainer Judy Garland. American actress and singer Paige O'Hara was performing on Broadway when she first read about Disney's then-upcoming animated project Beauty and the Beast in an article in The New York Times. Upon discovering that the studio was holding auditions for the lead role of Belle and, at the behest of lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken, specifically recruiting Broadway performers, O'Hara immediately insisted that her agent get her an audition. Familiar with O'Hara's Broadway stint as Ellie May Chipley in the musical Show Boat; Ashman had already been eyeing O'Hara for the part. O'Hara auditioned for the role five times, competing against approximately 500 other actresses. First auditioning solely for casting director Albert Taveres, O'Hara's next two auditions simply required the actress to mail audio recordings of her voice to the studio in Los Angeles. Required to perform a song of her choice, O'Hara sang [...] "Heaven <b>Help</b> <b>My</b> Heart" [...] from the musical Chess. At her first legitimate audition, O'Hara spoke and sang in a higher register than her own in an effort to mimic Snow White from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, but the filmmakers insisted that she use her own voice instead. In addition to Ashman and Menken, O'Hara's last few auditions were attended by directors Wise and Gary Trousdale, and producers Katzenberg and Don Hahn. O'Hara recalled that the songwriters would first close their eyes and listen to her before finally watching her perform. An hour after her fifth and final audition, O'Hara received a telephone call from Disney on her birthday informing her that she had been cast. The actress was fairly confident that the role was hers before she was officially cast, and credits the fact that Ashman enjoyed her performance on the cast recording of the musical Show Boat. O'Hara admitted, [...] "I'm not usually confident about auditions ... but I just understood (Belle) so much." ...|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of {{training}} camp, Munnerlyn told ESPN, [...] "I want to <b>help</b> <b>my</b> team get to the playoffs," [...] he said. [...] "I haven't been to the playoffs yet, and I've been in the league for four years. That's my No. 1 goal." [...] Munnerlyn wounded up starting all 16 games {{for the first time as}} a Panther at cornerback. He collected two interceptions and led the team with a career-high 13 passes defensed. He returned both interception for touchdowns, tying his own record from the previous season and becoming the new owner of the franchise record with five interception returns for touchdowns. The five interception returns for touchdowns through his first five seasons were tied for the most for any NFL player that began his career since 1970. Munnerlyn finished third on the team with a career-high 74 tackles and posted a career-high 3.5 sacks, three quarterback pressures, one forced fumble and one fumble recovery, playing a key role as a member of a defensive unit that ranked second in the NFL in total defense and points allowed and led the league in sacks while finishing second in rushing defense and sixth in passing defense. In Week 6 at Minnesota, he ripped the ball away from Vikings running back Adrian Peterson to force a fumble. In Week 7, he set the second fastest touchdown to start a game in team history after he intercepted a pass by Rams quarterback Sam Bradford on the first offensive play of the game and returned it 45 yards for the score, coming 21 seconds into the game; later in the game, he also recovered a fumble by wide receiver Tavon Austin that set up a field goal for the Panthers. In Week 13 at the Miami Dolphins, he compiled a single-game career-high and team-leading 13 tackles as the Panthers won 20-16. On December 15, he set the franchise record with his fifth career interception return for a touchdown after he picked off Jets' quarterback Geno Smith and returned it 41 yards for the score, surpassing the previous mark of four by Mike Minter from 1997 to 2006; in that game, he also established a single-game career high with two sacks as he brought down Smith for losses of seven and eight yards. The following week against the New Orleans Saints, he was credited with 1.5 sacks, one when he blitzed quarterback Drew Brees for a five-yard loss and the half combined with defensive end Greg Hardy to sack Brees for another five-yard loss. Munnerlyn helped the Panthers win the NFC South title in 2013 and earn the No. 2 seed in the NFC for the playoffs.|$|E
