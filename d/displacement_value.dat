50|$|The study {{indicates}} that the Ius-Melas-Coprates fault zone is a left-slip transtensional system {{similar to that of}} the Dead Sea fault zone on Earth. The magnitude of displacement across the fault zone is estimated to be 150-160 km, as indicated by the offset rim of an old impact basin. If normalizing the magnitude of the slip to the surface area of the planet, the Ius-Melas-Coprates fault zone has a <b>displacement</b> <b>value</b> significantly larger than that of the Dead Sea fault, and slightly larger than that of the San Andreas fault. The lack of significant deformation on both sides of the Ius-Melas-Coprates fault zone over a distance of 500 km suggests that the regions bounded by the fault behave as rigid blocks. This evidence essentially points to a large strike-slip system at a plate boundary, in terrestrial terms known as a transform fault.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Purpose {{of current}} study was biomechanical {{comparison}} of changes wrought on motion segments after minimally invasive percutan endoscopic discectomized and intact spine. Materials and Methods: We prepared ten fresh-frozen lamb spines were used for this study. The spine of each specimen was dissected between L 4 -L 5. The biomechanical tests for both intact spine and discectomized spine were performed by using axial compression testing machine (AG-I 10 kN, Shimadzu, Japanese). The axial compression was applied to all specimens with the loading speed of 5 mm/min. 8400 N/mm moment was applied to each specimen to achieve flexion and extension motions, right and left bending by a specially designed fixture. Results: In axial compression and flexion tests, the specimens were more stable according to <b>displacement</b> <b>values.</b> The <b>displacement</b> <b>values</b> of sectioned specimens were closer to intact specimens. Only <b>displacement</b> <b>values</b> of left-bending anteroposterior test for both situations were significant (0. 05;# 8805; P). Conclusion: PTED hasn't biomechanical and cilinical disadvantages. Endoscopic discectomy hadn't any disadvantages in stability. Only anterior-posterior <b>displacement</b> <b>values</b> of left bending test were statistically significant. We consider that cause of these results were {{due to the fact}} that all specimens had percutan transforaminal endoscopic discectomy (PTED) from left side...|$|R

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of ocean tide loading (OTL) <b>displacement</b> <b>values</b> {{has long been}} assumed {{to be dominated by}} errors in the ocean tide models used, with errors due to the convolution scheme used considered very small (2 - 5 %). However, this paper shows that much larger convolution errors can arise at sites within approximately 150 km of the coastline, depending on the method used to refine the discrete regularly spaced grid cells of the ocean tide model to better fit the coastline closest to the site of interest. If the local water mass redistribution approach is implemented, as used in the OLFG/OLMPP software recommended in the IERS 2003 conventions, OTL height displacement errors of up to around 20 % can arise, depending on the ocean tide model used. Bilinear interpolation only, as used in the SPOTL and CARGA softwares for example, is shown from extensive global and regional comparisons of OTL <b>displacement</b> <b>values</b> derived from the different methods and softwares to be more appropriate.

RESULTS: Important features of brain dynamics, such as caudal displacement amplitude and the time-to-peak of the pulse wave were derived for six regions in the brain. Peak <b>displacement</b> <b>values</b> amounted to 0. 18 +/- 0. 02 mm, 0. 10 +/- 0. 01 mm, 0. 09 +/- 0. 02 mm, and 0. 04 +/- 0. 01 mm for regions in the pons, cerebellum, corpus callosum (splenium), and frontal lobe, respectively. <b>Displacement</b> <b>values</b> of the pons differed significantly from all other regions measured.
