40|$|This {{application}} note explains how to convert various reference frames for Crossbow’s Inertial Systems {{in general and}} NAV 420 CA in particular. The Crossbow’s Navigation System or NAV 420 CA uses a 3 -axis accelerometer and a 3 -axis rate sensor to make a complete measurement {{of the dynamics of}} the system. The addition of a 3 -axis magnetometer inside the Crossbow AHRS allows it to make a true measurement of magnetic heading without an external <b>flux</b> <b>valve.</b> When GPS receiver is added to the system, the combined system becomes a low-cost INS that can output location, velocity and acceleration. Inertial Coordinate Frames The NAV 420 CA has a label on one face illustrating the NAV 420 CA coordinate system as shown in Figure 1. With the connector facing you, and the mounting plate down, the axes are defined as: yaw roll Z X pitch Y X-axis – from face with connector through the NAV 420 CA Y-axis – along the face with connector from left to right Z-axis – along the face with the connector from top to bottom Figure 1 : NAV 420 CA Coordinate System The axes form an orthogonal right-handed coordinate system. Its origin is nominally located at the vehicle CG. In Figure 2, the body frame of the system is shown relative to the tangent frame or local level horizontal frame. X b-North (X tan) γ...|$|E
40|$|A {{dental unit}} water line (DUWL) {{equipped}} with a device designed to automatically and continually flush a bacteriostatic solution of hydrogen peroxide (WHE) and a discontinuous disinfecting system (BIOSTER) was evaluated. In the first instance a preliminary sensitivity test on {{a large number of}} microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) was tried with a H 2 O 2 range from 100 to 800 ppm. The bacteria frequently reported in DUWL (including Pseudomonas spp, Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., E. coli) and some periodontal pathogens showed a minimum inhibitory concentration from 100 to 300 H 2 O 2 ppm (also including M. marinum and C. albicans). However, H 2 O 2 did not show any inhibitory effects against: A. actinomycetemcomitans, C. glabrata C. parapsilos, F. nucleatum, M. micros. In a second step, the DUWL was experimentally infected with S. faecalis, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus. After disinfection steps with 3 % H 2 O 2, the inhibitory effect on planktonic forms and on sessile biofilm was measured. In a third step, the count of 16 S rRNA gene copies by real time PCR at different points of the DUWL described an accrue of bacterial slime in “hot spot” regions characterized by irregular/slow water <b>flux</b> (<b>valves,</b> elbows). However these results suggest that hydrogen peroxide is not only able to inhibit bursts of planktonic bacteria inside the DUWL, but that it could also be effective against sessile biofilm containing heterotrophic microorganisms derived from domestic water line contamination. In addition some oral pathogens could be contaminating and surviving in DUWL...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With the {{mechanics}} model, the analytic formula of the deformation for the trapezium throttle slice was established. By the vehicle parameters and valve opening velocity, the formula of {{valve opening pressure}} was built. Based on this, through the relation of pressure with deformation and <b>flux</b> at <b>valve</b> opening, the design formula of throttle slice thickness and throttle-hole area were established, the influencing factors to the design parameters were analyzed. A practical example of design of hydro-pneumatic spring was given, and the performance test was conducted. The analysis and test {{results show that the}} design method is effective and the formulas for throttle slice thickness and throttle-hole area are accurate enough, and have important meaning for the hydro-pneumatic spring design...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows the}} {{development}} of a portable multiphase flow measurement system based in cyclonic separation technology GLCC@ 1. This system is aimed for oil well measurement and was developed in three phases; the first devoted to the geometric design of a cyclonic separator by means of design software GLCC V 7. 8 and the selection of measurement instrumentation and <b>flux</b> control <b>valves.</b> In the second phase, the automatic control system was designed for the implementation of four control strategies each one related with a possible scenario of the well behavior. The third constitutes the integration of the measurement and control devices through a user interface aimed for visualization, information processing and system's operation and control. Experimental results in oil well measurements show the efficiency and workability of the integrated system...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} the design, fabrication, and {{testing of a prototype}} microvalve which makes use of a novel magnetic microactuator. The completed device consists of three layers, with the bottom two layers making up the normally closed valve. The top layer (actuator) contains the flux generator on its top surface combined with Ni/Fe plated through holes for guiding the <b>flux</b> to the <b>valve.</b> The actuator and valve components are separately fabricated and then mounted onto a glass motherboard which contains both fluid flow channels and patterned gold traces for making electrical connections. In addition to providing an easy means for testing, the motherboard will allow for the later attachment of other microfluidic components to create a complete microfluidic total analysis system (mTAS) on a single substrate. Preliminary test results show that the valve is capable of controlling gas and liquid flow in the range of submicroliters to hundreds of mL/min...|$|R
40|$|We studied time-series fluxes of diatom {{particles}} {{and their relationship}} to hydrographic variations from 4 October 2010 through 18 September 2012 using bottom-tethered sediment trap moorings deployed at Station NAP (75 ° N, 162 ° W; 1975 m water depth) in the western Arctic Ocean. We observed clear maxima of the diatom <b>valve</b> <b>flux</b> in November–December of both 2010 and 2011, and in August 2011. Diatoms in samples were categorized into 98 taxa. The diatom flux maxima were characterized by many resting spores in November–December and by the sea ice-associated diatom Fossula arctica in August 2011. These assemblages along with abundant clay minerals in the samples suggest a significant influence of shelf-origin materials transported by mesoscale eddies, which developed along the Chukchi Sea shelf break. In contrast, the fluxes of total mass and diatoms were reduced in summer 2012. We hypothesize that this suppression reflects the influx of oligotrophic water originating from the central Canada Basin. A physical oceanographic model demonstrated that oligotrophic surface water from the Beaufort Gyre was supplied to Station NAP from December 2011 to early half of 2012...|$|R
40|$|International audienceParticle fluxes were {{recorded}} over a one-year period (2001 - 02) {{in the southern}} Antarctic Zone in the Australian Sector of the Southern Ocean. Here, we present the results on the seasonal and vertical variability of biogenic particle and diatom <b>valve</b> <b>fluxes.</b> Total mass and diatom fluxes were highly seasonal, with maxima registered during the austral summer and minima during winter. Biogenic opal dominated sedimentation, followed by carbonate, and very low levels of organic carbon (annual average 1. 4 %). The strong correlation between opal and organic carbon at both depth levels suggests that a significant fraction of organic matter exported to the deep sea was associated with diatom sedimentation events. Seasonal diatom fluxes appear driven principally by changes in the flux of Fragilariopsis kerguelensis. The occurrence of the sea-ice affiliated diatoms Fragilariopsis cylindrus and Fragilariopsis curta in both sediment traps is considered to correspond to the sedimentation of a diatom bloom advected from an area {{under the influence of}} sea ice. Highest fluxes of the subsurface-dwelling species Thalassiothrix antarctica registered {{at the end of the}} summer bloom were linked to a drop of the light levels during the summer-autumn transition. This study provides the first annual observation on seasonal succession of diatom species in the Australian sector of the Antarctic Zone, and corresponds, in terms of magnitude and seasonality of diatom fluxes, to those in neighbouring sectors (Pacific and eastern Atlantic) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceUpper ocean {{plankton}} assemblages {{are known}} to influence the export of carbon and biominerals from the mixed layer. However, relationships between plankton community structure and the magnitude and stoichiometry of export remain poorly characterized. We present data on biogeochemical and diatom export fluxes from the annual deployment of a sediment trap in a High Nutrient, Low Chlorophyll (HNLC) area upstream of the Kerguelen Plateau (KERFIX station). The weak and tidal-driven circulation provided favorable conditions for a quantitative analysis of export processes. Particulate organic carbon (POC) fluxes were highest in spring and summer. Biogenic silica (BSi) fluxes displayed similar seasonal patterns, although BSi:POC ratios were elevated in winter. Fragilariopsis kerguelensis dominated the annual diatom export assemblage (59. 8 % of the total <b>valve</b> <b>flux).</b> We identified clusters of diatom species that were positively or negatively correlated to the BSi:POC ratio. Our {{results indicate that the}} differential role of certain diatom species for carbon and silicon export, previously identified from iron-fertilized productive areas, is also valid in HNLC regimes. Although annual POC export below the mixed layer of the HNLC site is twofold lower that the one previously reported in a naturally iron-fertilized area of the Kerguelen Plateau, the fraction of seasonal net community production exported is similar at both sites (~ 1. 5 %). These findings suggest that natural iron fertilization increases the strength but not the efficiency of carbon export from the mixed layer...|$|R
