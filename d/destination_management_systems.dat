40|$|This paper {{suggests}} {{that many of the}} negative effects of globalization and inadequate tourism growth can be compensate by the use of intelligent ICT solutions in the development of heritage tourism. The encounter between cultural tourism and information and communication technologies represents an opportunity to preserve national culture, create partnership and enhance destinations value in information society. To this aim, we propose a model for local <b>Destination</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Systems</b> of heritage destinations (DMS) which could help to achieve a more globally responsible paradigm for the tourism industry and facilitate the management of destinations and the coordination of the local suppliers. DMSs provide interactive demonstrations of local amenities and attractions and enable consumers to build their own itinerary based on their interests and requirements. All the stakeholders within the destination are linked with each other in order to create collaborative action and a genuine, sustained growth in heritage tourism.

40|$|The {{competitiveness}} of tourism destinations is {{a relevant issue for}} tourism studies, moreso, {{is a key}} element on the daily basis of tourism destinations. In this sense, the <b>management</b> of tourism <b>destinations</b> is essential to maintain competitive advantages. In this article tourism destination is considered as a relational network, where interaction and cooperation is needed among tourist agents, to achieve major levels of competitive advantage and a more effective <b>destination</b> <b>management</b> <b>system.</b> In addition, the perceptions of tourists are obtained from two main sources. The first one is the social construction of a tourism destination previous to the visit and the second one is obtained from the interaction between tourists and tourism destination agents during the visit. In this sense, the <b>management</b> of tourism <b>destination</b> to emit a homogenous and collective image is a factor that can reduce the gap if dissatisfaction from the previous and real tourist perception.

40|$|Tourism has {{a rather}} long {{business}} value chain and <b>Destination</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Systems</b> (DMS) have revolutionized {{the ways that}} the travel and tourist industry operates. Current web-based DMS cannot interoperate with other systems and data sources, as they are heterogeneous. In particular, DMS are based on different Information Systems (viz. hardware and software platforms), but mainly they use different data for representing tourism products and services. Data heterogeneity is a well-known problem, which is solved by providing semantic reconciliation among the different systems, with respect to shared conceptual reference schema: the domain ontology. DMS is a perfect application area for Semantic Web technologies, since information dissemination and exchange are the key-backbones of the destination management. DMS should take advantage of semantic services, interoperability, ontologies and semantic annotation. The Semantic Web could offer more flexibility to DMS {{through the use of}} new emergent Semantic Web technologies such as ‘intelligent ’ software agents and annotation tools.

40|$|The tourist {{industry}} plays an immense {{role in the}} socio-economic development of different regions. <b>Destination</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Systems</b> (DMS) are significant in developing e-tourism. DMS integrate data from Small and Medium-Sized Tourism Enterprises (SMTEs) in order for tourists to find information about e. g. accommodation, restaurants and attractions of a certain location. Although being represented in a DMS {{has proven to be}} advantageous, not all SMTEs are participating in such systems. This thesis aims to explore the possible factors that influence, motivate and inhabited regional SMTEs to participate in DMS and to create a framework from these factors. Data was collected by semi-structured interviews performed with respondents from SMTEs in Jönköping County, Sweden and Liverpool City, United Kingdom. The transcriptions from the interviews were analyzed by content analysis in order to create categories of factors. The motivating factors were categorized in technological, organizational and external factors. Technological factors were user friendliness, system quality, effectiveness, information quality, system performance, system updates and information up-dates. The organizational factors were management support, available resources {{and the size of the}} organization. The external factors competitive pressure, cost effectiveness, distribution channel, user satisfaction and to provide quality services to customers. The inhibiting factors were categorized into administration factors and communication factors, where the predominant factor was lack of know-how. The communication factors were lack of available information and lack of communication between organizations.

40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} {{use of the}} Web as {{a channel}} of distribution within the tourism industry naturally leads to a situation where its effectiveness needs to be examined and justified. While {{there is a growing}} realisation of the need to assess the effectiveness of a <b>Destination</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Systems</b> (DMS) based websites, research into this area in the tourism domain has been quite limited and narrow in focus. This situation is further {{compounded by the fact that}} currently there is little in the way of appropriate models and techniques in place to manage a DMS based websites effectively and that there is a general lack of consensus when it comes to defining and understanding its standards and concepts. This thesis describes a methodology for the development and evaluation of a comprehensive set of weighted dimensions and criteria for measuring the effectiveness of DMS based websites. Ultimately, from a DMS perspective, website effectiveness depends on how well a website performs with respect to the related business goals. The scope of the research was limited to assessing the impact of DMS effectiveness on the accommodation sector. This research began by employing a Delphi study to generate, validate and prioritise a comprehensive set of dimensions and criteria for measuring the effectiveness of a DMS. The Delphi study successfully identified a total of 12 dimensions and 105 criteria required to assess DMS based websites effectiveness. These components were incorporated into a comprehensive evaluation framework applied specifically to evaluate the effectiveness of a DMS based websites using a diverse range of approaches and perspectives. The evaluation phase of the research took place over an eight month period and concentrated on testing this framework using VisitScotland. com as a test bed. The outcomes from the evaluation phase successfully demonstrated that the framework provides DMS management with a comprehensive method to measure and manage the effectiveness of their Web presence by not only identifying areas of the website and website strategy that needed attention but also by providing advice and suggestions on how to improve these areas...|$|E

Tourist destination can be identified with the tourist supply (product) from the elements of the tourist system: the tourist supply and the tourist destination are consisting just of the same elements.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether there is a need for better tourism information on a portable media like a PDA or mobile phone. The market segment addressed in this market research was boat tourists in the Baltic Sea Region. Two parallel surveys were carried out; a quantitative survey with a sample of 665 respondents and a qualitative survey with 30 respondents. The results indicates that boat tourists have a complex information search process. The boat tourists in this region would like to see a lot of improvements on the information they retrieve, especially in relation to weather, vacancy in harbour, harbour facilities, digital 3 dimensional vizualisation of harbour entry and leisure shopping/land based activities. Almost half of the respondents would like to receive the information they need on a mobile device. To a great extend, improvements on the information and distribution side will also influence the decision process in terms of which harbours they will visit and how long they will stay in the harbours. The great desire for improved information services indicates a market potential for content providers in the tourism segment. In this respect, the author addresses the importance of the <b>Destination</b> <b>Management</b> Organisations (DMOs) in this paper.

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{the role of}} knowledge in good governance for tourist destinations. In this context, the chapter identifies the broad processes and institutions involved in governance and decision making regarding tourism. These include levels of government, promotion and marketing organizations, tourism industry sectors, residents groups and community leaders, in addition to development organizations {{with a focus on}} tourism. The key focus of this chapter is to explore the importance of knowledge in being responsive and in achieving successful (or unsuccessful) outcomes in destination governance. Numerous challenges and barriers to sustainable tourism development are described through her analysis of 100 case studies of development processes in peripheral regions internationally. By exploring knowledge provision, communication and ownership, the chapter makes a case for its importance in successful tourism governance. Once these issues and barriers have been identified, principles for the effective use of knowledge in tourist destination governance are discussed. A number of factors, such as the importance of knowledge in reference to <b>destination</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems,</b> participation mechanisms and educational approaches, are developed further in the later section of the chapter. In order to explore the importance of knowledge further, the chapter develops a concept of 'good' governance in the context of tourism development and decision making, primarily moving away from the exercise of power and towards enhanced democratic, community capacity building and participatory approaches to destination management. The importance of sustainability and public involvement in decision making and governance are acknowledged. The chapter concludes in stressing the importance of knowledge provision and the movement away from tourism as primarily an economic resource that has been the focus in regional community development, with a shift toward governance which emphasizes tourism as a community resource and social force. This chapter has introduced the reader to issues and considerations of destination governance and presents an overview of the following four chapters. Though solutions may be found for dealing with specific governance challenges, understanding the diversity of issues and considerations which impact on destination governance may provide a strong foundation for developing more integrated, sustainable and comprehensive approaches for governance within tourist destinations...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} is an {{investigation}} into <b>Destination</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Systems</b> (DMS) website effectiveness and evaluation {{in the tourism domain}} from both academic and industry (destination management) perspectives. This thesis begins with a comprehensive review of the literature about theories, concepts and methods used for DMS website effectiveness evaluation. The future direction of DMS website evaluation in tourism and a conceptual framework that defines the contemporary theory versus practice of the DMS websites evaluation is elaborated. The research employed first three rounds of Delphi study to generate an up-to-date definition and aims of DMS. The Delphi study also generated an up-to-date comprehensive set of dimensions and criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of DMS websites. The research then employed structured interviews as well as online survey sent to forty-six official destination websites to review how industry is evaluating their DMS websites. What approaches they use in addition to the criteria and dimensions when evaluating the effectiveness of their DMS websites is explored. This thesis also reviews additional aspects related to the in destination evaluation. The findings of the Delphi study indicated that there is a rising emergence of social media as a new important component related to DMS. The findings also suggested additional aims to previously identified aims of the DMS. The new additional aims of DMS found in this research are: support sustainable destination management; empower and support tourism firms; enable collaboration at the destination; increase consumer satisfaction level and capture consumer data. Further findings also indicated compared with these established by previous researchers there are new additions to the evaluation dimensions of DMS websites proposed which are: sustainability, marketing, collaboration issues, and goals of the website. The findings of this thesis indicated that there is a congruence and consensus between academic experts and industry in terms of the most dimensions that are crucial for DMS websites evaluation. The findings, however, indicated that there is limited parallel between criteria identified with the Delphi study and those found and used by destination management practitioners. This thesis calls for additional research to develop a support system to ensure a focused involvement between academia and industry in the area of DMS website evaluation. This thesis contributes to knowledge by generating an up-to-date and comprehensive set of dimensions and criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of a DMS website. This thesis also contributes to knowledge through the identification of the current dimensions, criteria, and evaluation approaches used by industry practitioners. This research adopted a strategy in presenting the literature review that enhanced the understanding of the DMS websites and their comprehensive evaluation in tourism. This research {{is one of the first}} studies in the tourism field that reviews and sheds light on and compares and contracts contemporary thinking on both academia and industry evaluation of DMS websites...|$|E
40|$|Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) have revolutionised {{the travel}} {{industry}} in the last decade. eTourism reflects the digitalisation of all processes and value chains in the tourism, travel, hospitality and catering industries. It emerges as a term describing {{the entire range of}} applications of ICTs on tourism and the implications for the tourism value chain. Major opportunities and challenges have emerged and need to be addressed by all industry players. However, the level of eTourism developments varies between regions, countries and continents. The key objective of this research has been to examine the eTourism developments in Greece as a country that is gradually embracing eCommerce. In particular the research examines the level of ICT diffusion in Small and Medium–sized Tourism Enterprises (SMTEs) as well as whether the level of online presence is sufficient to cover for the lack of <b>Destination</b> <b>Management</b> <b>System</b> (DMS). Results indicate that the Greek online travel market is at the early stages of its eCommerce deployment but it demonstrates great potential for further eTourism developments. However, the low level of co-operation between SMTEs and the serious doubts about the ability of the National Tourism Organisation to co-ordinate the destination makes the prospect of a DMS development in Greece questionable. The research concludes that ICT-enabled local co-operation can potentially assist SMTEs to enhance their competitiveness and increase their global presence. </p...|$|R

However, the problem is that first, a tourist does not know which site to access and second if she founds certain sites how to compare the results of these sites. We describe an advanced meta-search engine designed to search for available accommodation in different search portals. The engine can be accessed from different platforms such as Internet browser, public multimedia Internet terminals, or mobile devices such as PDAs or cell phones. The engine is applied in two different scenarios: a <b>destination</b> <b>management</b> <b>system</b> uses the meta-search to bundle the services of different search engines for a certain tourism destination or a service provider offers a mobile solution to its clients where dependent on the position of the mobile client or other context attributes an accommodation is searched for nearby. The solution is based on Web service interfaces to the individual search engines and the meta-search again is deployed as a Web service to enable the easy integration into other applications. This supports also the implementation for different client platforms, since only the presentation layer has to be adapted. The system solves problems of different representational concepts in different used search engines. The engine includes geographical services such as geo-coding or map representation delivered by external providers. Since the search engines use different data, different geographic concepts and different granularities of knowledge we use a domain-ontology to translate between concepts.

40|$|This study aims {{to enhance}} the {{understanding}} of <b>destination</b> <b>management</b> <b>system</b> (DMS) effectiveness and its evaluation. Upon review of the literature, it was established that DMS effectiveness and its evaluation {{has not yet been}} researched adequately. Informed by an interpretive approach, this study contributes to research particularly by investigating what constitutes effectiveness and explores the aspects (factors and relationships) that need to be considered in a holistic DMS effectiveness evaluation. Based on a qualitative case study strategy, this study adopts a comprehensive approach that considers multiple stakeholder groups� perspectives. The research evidence is collected through a case-study of the Egyptian DMS experience (the Touregypt project). The Touregypt project gives insights to the understanding of three DMS cases that have not been researched before in DMS literature: first, an actual DMS application in a developing country; second, a public and private sector partnership experience; and third, a failed DMS experience (the system has failed {{in the course of this}} research). Prompted by the interpretive approach, this study tried to explore DMS effectiveness based on the perspectives, attitudes and experiences of the multiple stakeholder groups (Hesse-Biber and Leavy 2010). Accordingly, the empirical data was collected through a multi-method approach that includes interviews, observation, archival document analysis (including Touregypt forum analysis), and website analysis. Data has been analyzed guided by discourse analysis, complemented with the general inductive approach of Miles and Huberman (1994). Following an interpretive theory-building strategy, the analyzed data has been further interpreted in the light of prior theories of DMS and information systems research, particularly the Delone and MacLean IS effectiveness theory (1992, 2003, and 2004). The main contribution of this study to knowledge is a theory based model that enhances the understanding of DMS effectiveness evaluation. The suggested model identifies the aspects (factors and relationships) that need to be considered when evaluating the effectiveness of DMS. Also, the results of this study give insights to the understanding of DMS effectiveness by shedding light on what constitutes effectiveness and the possible relationship between such constructs.

It concentrates on seeking to understand what constitutes the general concept of <b>destination</b> <b>management,</b> exploring management practices, and clarifying the overall management of the local destination. In the absence of previous literature, a conceptual framework is developed from the bodies of literature in tourism, management, inter-organizational relationships, and integrated coastal management. This framework illustrates aspects, issues, and dimensions {{that are relevant to}} <b>destination</b> <b>management</b> and provides a structure for the analysis of <b>destination</b> <b>management</b> in Pattaya, Thailand. Given the exploratory nature of the study, a multi-phase case study is used. A mix of holistic and embedded cases is used to obtain broad and in-depth data relevant to the concept and practice of <b>destination</b> <b>management.</b> Pattaya, as one of the major coastal resorts in Thailand, is selected as the case study as tourism has been developed there for several decades and its diverse problems provide a range of management challenges. Its major tourism attractions - beaches, nightlife, Pattaya Music Festival - are examined as embedded cases. In addition to secondary data, semi-structured interviews and observation are used to collect primary data. The broad concept of <b>destination</b> <b>management</b> is developed first and then used as a basis to examine {{the nature and extent of}} <b>destination</b> <b>management</b> in Pattaya. The conceptual framework provides a structure to analyze the individual embedded cases and to compare commonalities and differences between their management processes and structures and their implications for the practice of <b>destination</b> <b>management.</b> The research reveals that there is a relationship between the practitioners' perspectives on a tourism destination and on <b>destination</b> <b>management,</b> and that there is a relationship between their initial perspectives on <b>destination</b> <b>management</b> and their management practices that occur at the <b>destination.</b> <b>Destination</b> <b>management</b> is defined as "the collaboration of relevant agencies responsible for providing multiple tourism products at the destination in a way to achieve common goals or destination goals. " The research also highlights that <b>destination</b> <b>management</b> requires the integration of management agencies, of management purposes, and of management activities at the destination scale. In Pattaya, varying levels of integration occur and relevant agencies are commonly involved with managing aspects of tourism rather than the destination as a whole. The embedded cases reveal that two main forms of management occur in Pattaya: daily operations and project management. Daily management is practised by single agencies to achieve individual organizational goals and is evident in most aspects of beach management and the management of dispersed nightlife activities. Project-based management involves the pursuit of project goals and is carried out by committees, for example, Walking Street Committee and the Pattaya Music Festival Committees. A lack of common goals and low levels of integration are factors which lead to an absence of <b>destination</b> <b>management.</b> The formulation of destination goals and a scaled-up project management structure is suggested as one means of fostering <b>destination</b> <b>management...</b>|$|R

40|$|Although {{tourists}} are frequently {{cited as the}} central focus of much <b>destination</b> <b>management</b> activity {{little is known about}} how they regard <b>destination</b> <b>management.</b> Through a series of focus groups with guests at youth hostels in three locations in New Zealand, this study provides empirical evidence as to whether tourists consider destinations need to be managed; why <b>destination</b> <b>management</b> is needed; what it should involve; and what differentiates good destinations from poor ones. Their views are then compared with <b>destination</b> marketing and <b>management</b> strategies in the three locations to assess how well current practices match the tourists’ perspective. The tourists’ responses endorse the need for <b>destination</b> <b>management</b> and show a broad appreciation of why destinations should be managed. The participants see a need for destination marketing, value the provision of information and acknowledge the importance of visitor management. However, they strongly expressed the view that destinations should not be over-managed, raising the question of where the boundaries lie between effective <b>destination</b> <b>management</b> and over-management. The factors which differentiate good destinations from poor ones might be grouped under two broad themes: those associated with tourists’ motivations and expectations and those related to a range of destination attributes. Comparison of the focus group participants’ views with the strategies and plans of the three destinations reveals a degree of concordance but also emphasizes that consideration of their perspective alone is critical but insufficient for comprehensive <b>destination</b> <b>management</b> which needs to take account of the views of all stakeholders...|$|R
