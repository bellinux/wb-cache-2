40|$|To {{increase}} aerodynamic performance, the <b>geometric</b> <b>porosity</b> of a ringsail spacecraft {{parachute canopy}} is sometimes increased, beyond the "rings" and "sails" {{with hundreds of}} "ring gaps" and "sail slits. " This creates extra computational challenges for fluid [...] structure interaction (FSI) modeling of clusters of such parachutes, beyond those created by the lightness of the canopy structure, geometric complexities of hundreds of gaps and slits, and the contact between the parachutes of the cluster. In FSI computation of parachutes with such "modified geometric porosity," the flow through the "windows" created by {{the removal of the}} panels and the wider gaps created by the removal of the sails cannot be accurately modeled with the Homogenized Modeling of <b>Geometric</b> <b>Porosity</b> (HMGP), which was introduced to deal with the hundreds of gaps and slits. The flow needs to be actually resolved. All these computational challenges need to be addressed simultaneously in FSI modeling of clusters of spacecraft parachutes with modified <b>geometric</b> <b>porosity.</b> The core numerical technology is the Stabilized Space [...] Time FSI (SSTFSI) technique, and the contact between the parachutes is handled with the Surface-Edge-Node Contact Tracking (SENCT) technique. In the computations reported here, in addition to the SSTFSI and SENCT techniques and HMGP, we use the special techniques we have developed for removing the numerical spinning component of the parachute motion and for restoring the mesh integrity without a remesh.

40|$|Proton {{exchange}} membrane {{fuel cells}} have been promoted due to improved breakthrough and increased commercialization. The assembly pressure {{put on a}} single cell and a fuel cell stack has important influence on the geometric deformation of the gas diffusion layers (GDLs) resulting in a change in porosity, permeability, and the resistance for heat and charge transfer in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. In this paper, both the finite {{element method and the}} finite volume method are used, respectively, to predict the GDL deformation and associated effects on the <b>geometric</b> parameters, <b>porosity,</b> mass transport property, and the cell performance. It is found that based on the isotropic Young's modulus and the finite element method, the porosity and thickness under a certain assembly pressure are non-homogeneous across the fuel cell in the in-plane direction. The variations of the porosity change and compression ratio in the cross-section plane are localized by three zones, that is, a linear porosity zone, a constant porosity zone, and a nonlinear porosity zone. The results showed that the GDL porosity and compression ratios maintain linear and nonlinear changes in the zone above the shoulders and the zone under the channel but close to the shoulder, respectively. However, a constant value is kept above the middle of the channel. The obtained non-homogeneous porosity distribution is applied together with the deformed GDL for further computational fluid dynamics analysis, in which the finite volume method is implemented. The computational fluid dynamic results reveal that a higher assembly pressure decreases the porosity, GDL thickness, gas flow channel cross-sectional areas, oxygen diffusion coefficient, oxygen concentration, and cell performance. The maximum oxygen mole fraction occurs where the maximum porosity exists. A sufficient GDL thickness is required to ensure transfer of fresh gas to the reaction sites far away from the channel. However, the reduction of porosity is a dominating factor that decreases the cell performance compared with the decreased gas channel flow area and GDL thickness in the assembly condition. Therefore, the assembly pressure should be balanced to consider both the cell performance and gas sealing security...|$|R

For the first time, an imaging setup and the required machine vision (MV) algorithms were developed, implemented, and evaluated {{to inspect the}} part cross sectional geometry and to provide an assessment of porosity, in metal powder-bed AM, by direct visualization of porosity from in-situ visual camera images. A visual imaging setup was developed to produce images in-situ from each layer that visualize the fused objects in the layer of powder and the detailed surface quality in terms of formed porosity. Appropriate image processing algorithms were designed and implemented for detection of fused geometric objects and estimation of the geometric parameters. Geometric objects were detected with a boundary point-to-point (root-mean-square) error of 81 microns. Formed porosity was directly detected from the camera images of the layers using machine vision algorithms. In addition to detection of individual pores, an intelligent approach was proposed and implemented to identify defective regions in the part layer that provides a qualitative assessment of porosity. For this purpose, a statistical Bayesian framework was developed and trained based on texture features. The Bayesian network {{was designed to maximize}} the Figure of Merit and finally led to sensitivity of 89 % and specificity of 82 %.

In bioengineering, there is interest in replacing metal-based implants with more functional implants consisting of porous bioceramics that are bioresorbable. In the design of bioinspired ceramic structures, there is a desire to understand the coupling between <b>geometric</b> complexity and <b>porosity</b> in natural structures such as bone. However, it has been difficult to process ceramics with controlled <b>porosity</b> and <b>geometric</b> complexity. In this research program, the ceramic processing technology known as “gelcasting ” has been employed to study the fabrication of model functional alumina implants that can possess physical characteristics similar to real bone. This technology, often used to make turbine blades and reactor parts, has been used here with added carbon impurity particles that are burned out during sintering to obtain porous microstructures. Gelcast alumina was used to fill a mold generated with a new mold design algorithm and machined using a new path planning algorithm that operated on a 3 -D image of a real bone structure, permitting the creation of artificial bone structures. For this effort, the fabrication of porous microstructures was studied using two different types of carbon: activated and graphitic. The mechanical performance of the artificial bone was characterized to gain insight into the structure/property/performance relationship of these geometrically complex, lightweight structures. It was determined that the activated carbon can be used to create more closed porosity at porosity levels of up to 35 %.

The effect of initial moisture content, frying oil temperature, flour particle size distribution, and degree of starch gelatinization on the moisture loss, oil absorption, changes in <b>geometric</b> dimensions, texture, <b>porosity,</b> and pore size distribution of tortilla chips during frying was studied. Isotherm, glass transition, and pore size distribution models during frying of tortilla chips were also developed. Tortilla chips with a high initial moisture content had a high rate of water loss and oil absorption during frying. As water evaporated tortilla chips shrank (in diameter) to a large extent and the chips' thickness increased. Tortilla chips fried in a higher oil temperature showed a higher degree of shrinkage and a lower degree of expansion. Crust formation occurred faster thus creating puffiness at the chips' surface. Higher oil temperature produced chips with a higher practicability and grouchiness. Oil temperature did not affect the final oil content of tortilla chips. The chips made from fine grain flour formed small pores during frying which accounted for the large amount of oil absorption. The coarse grain chips had the highest fracturability and the least crunchiness. Tortilla chips with a high starch gelatinization prior to frying shrank (in diameter) the most and no thickness expansion occurred. These chips absorbed a very small amount of oil that was deposited on the surface. Various models were fitted to determine which one predicted the experimental data of water activity the best. The Crapiste and Rotstein model (1986) provided the best correlation at the entire range of moisture content and temperatures. The equilibrium moisture content decreased as temperature and oil content increased for the same water activity value. The glass transition temperatures were fitted using the Gordon and Taylor equation. The glass transition curve for the fried chips with total oil content is higher than the one for the chips with partial oil content. A model was developed using the Extreme Value distribution to predict the pore size distribution of tortilla chips during frying. Pore size increases during frying and becomes more uniformly distributed as frying continues...|$|R

40|$|The Crew Exploration Vehicle Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) {{is being}} {{designed}} {{to land the}} Orion Crew Module (CM) at a safe rate of descent at splashdown with a cluster of two to three Main parachutes. The instantaneous rate of descent varies based on parachute fly-out angles and geometric inlet area. Parachutes in a cluster oscillate between significant fly-out angles and colliding into each other. The former presents a sub-optimal inlet area and the latter lowers the effective drag area as the parachutes interfere with each other. The fly-out angles are also important in meeting a twist torque requirement. Understanding cluster behavior necessitates measuring the Mains with photogrammetric analysis. Imagery from upward looking cameras is analyzed to determine parachute geometry. Fly-out angles are measured from each parachute vent to an axis determined from geometry. Determining {{the scale of the}} objects requires knowledge of camera and lens calibration as well as features of known size. Several points along the skirt are tracked to compute an effective circumference, diameter, and inlet area as a function of time.

40|$|Spacecraft parachutes are {{typically}} used in multiple stages, {{starting with a}} "reefed" stage where a cable along the parachute skirt constrains the diameter {{to be less than}} the diameter in the subsequent stage. After {{a certain period of time}} during the descent, the cable is cut and the parachute "disreefs" (i. e. expands) to the next stage. Computing the parachute shape at the reefed stage and fluid–-structure interaction (FSI) modeling during the disreefing involve computational challenges beyond those we have in FSI modeling of fully-open spacecraft parachutes. These additional challenges are created by the increased geometric complexities and by the rapid changes in the parachute geometry.

Experimental and numerical results highlight significant end wall interference effects in test cases (i) to (iii). These cause a lack of pitchwise periodicity in the flow. The discharge flow from the slotted board is reasonably well modelled by the numerical method in which a thick porous wall model is used. The predicted wall pressure distribution is in good quantitative agreement with the measurements. This has given confidence in using the numerical method as a design tool to improve the slotted board geometry. Specifically, numerical simulations have shown that a 14. 3 % porosity tailboard is able to minimise the wall interference, reinstating a sufficiently periodic flow inside the cascade...|$|E
40|$|At higher altitudes, {{prior to}} the {{deployment}} of the main parachutes, the Orion spacecraft descent to Earth will rely on deceleration by drogue parachutes. These parachutes have a ribbon construction, and in fluid–structure interaction (FSI) modeling this creates geometric and flow complexities comparable to those encountered in FSI modeling of the main parachutes, which have a ringsail construction. The drogue parachutes {{to be used with}} the Orion spacecraft have 24 gores, with 52 ribbons in each gore, resulting in hundreds of gaps that the flow goes through. We address this computational challenge, as was done for the main parachutes, with the Homogenized Modeling of <b>Geometric</b> <b>Porosity</b> (HMGP). Like the main parachutes, the drogue parachutes will be used in multiple stages, starting with a "reefed" stage where a cable along the parachute skirt constrains the diameter to be less than the diameter in the subsequent stage. After {{a certain period of time}} during the descent, the cable is cut and the parachute "disreefs" (i. e. expands) to the next stage. Computing the parachute shape at the reefed stage and FSI modeling during the disreefing involve computational challenges beyond those in FSI modeling of fully-open drogue parachutes. Orion spacecraft drogue parachutes will have three stages, with FSI modeling of disreefing from Stage 1 to Stage 2 being somewhat more challenging than disreefing from Stage 2 to Stage 3. We present the special modeling techniques we devised to address the computational challenges and the results from the computations carried out. We also present the methods we devised to calculate for a parachute gore the radius of curvature in the circumferential direction. The curvature values are intended for quick and simple engineering analysis in estimating the structural stresses. The flight envelope of the Orion drogue parachutes includes regions where the Mach number is high enough to require a compressible-flow solver. We present some preliminary computations for such cases...|$|E
