25|$|In chapter 96, a myth {{explaining}} Skíðblaðnirs {{creation is}} provided. The chapter details that the god Loki once {{cut off the}} goddess's Sif's hair {{in an act of}} mischief. Sif's husband, Thor, enraged, found Loki, caught <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> and threatened to break every last bone in his body. Loki promises to have the Svartálfar make Sif a new head of hair that will grow just as any other. Loki goes to the dwarfs known as Ivaldi's sons, and they made not only Sif a new head of gold hair but also Skíðblaðnir and the spear Gungnir. As the tale continues, Loki risks his neck for the creation of the devastating hammer Mjöllnir, the multiplying ring Draupnir, and the speedy, sky-and-water traveling, bright-bristled boar Gullinbursti. In the end, Loki's wit saves him his head, but results in the stitching together of his lips. The newly created items are doled out by the dwarfs to Sif, Thor, Odin, and Freyr. Freyr is gifted both Gullinbursti and Skíðblaðnir, the latter of which is again said to receive fair wind whenever its sail was set, and that it will go wherever it needs to, and that it can be folded up much as cloth and placed in one's pocket at will.|$|E

25|$|On 15 August 2010, Van Nistelrooy scored {{his only}} {{competitive}} hat-trick with Hamburg, in a 5–1 win over Torgelower SV Greif {{in the first}} round of the 2010–11 DFB-Pokal. On 21 August 2010, he scored a brace in Hamburg's season opener against Schalke 04, which HSV won 2–1. During that match, he played against his friend and former Real Madrid teammate Raúl, who was making his Bundesliga debut. In the January transfer window, Van Nistelrooy was linked a return move back to Real Madrid and could be used for a short-term basis to cover, following injuries of Gonzalo Higuaín and Karim Benzema as manager José Mourinho would be happy for Van Nistelrooy to join the club as Mourinho left the door for him. Van Nistelrooy admitted he seriously considered moving back to the club if the bid happened. The club, however, rejected Madrid's bid for Van Nistelrooy, giving the club a warning as Hamburg wants to keep <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> until the transfer window ended. Despite being angered over his move to Real Madrid rejected, Van Nistelrooy said he would remain committed at Hamburg. During a match between Hamburg and Hannover 96 on 16 April 2011, Van Nistelrooy suffered a calf injury that kept him out until the last matchday.|$|E
500|$|Midnight Sun {{was known}} for his calm disposition; it wasn't {{uncommon}} for stablehands at his home, Harlinsdale Farm near Franklin, Tennessee, to let visiting children ride him bareback, so they could say they rode a two-time world grand champion. In 1956 he was bought by Eleanor and Geraldine Livingston at the Harlinsdale Farm dispersal sale, for $50,000. The Livingstons stipulated that Midnight Sun be kept at Harlinsdale under the same routine he had had for most of his life. He continued to stand at stud on the farm until his death, and was handled and groomed nearly all his life by Red Laws, who died within a year of the horse's death. Midnight Sun was never turned out, and Laws once said, [...] "Somebody had <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> all his life." [...] In all, he lived at Harlinsdale Farm for 21 years. Midnight Sun died of colic on November 7, 1965, and was buried at Harlinsdale Farm, where his grave is still visible today.|$|E

500|$|The Lone Gunmen come to Mulder's {{apartment}} in disguise {{and tell him}} that they cannot find Scully. They reveal that they have found e-mails between Scully and a man called Cobra, who is apparently working on a shadow project at the Department of Defense. [...] Meanwhile, Scully wakes up in a cabin in Pennsylvania in pajamas instead of her clothes, and accuses The Smoking Man of drugging her. He claims she was merely exhausted and he was trying to make her comfortable. [...] She attempts to leave but decides to continue when The Smoking Man tells her she's free to go and that the choice of whether to accept his help or not is hers. Mulder and The Lone Gunmen go to Skinner to figure out why Scully was communicating with Cobra. They find that an anonymous person has hacked into Scully's computer and has been sending Cobra messages calling for a meeting. The group believe that it is the work of The Smoking Man, but Skinner still does not know how to get a <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> At dinner, The Smoking Man tells Scully that the cure he possesses is not just the cure for cancer, but for all human disease, and that it is extraterrestrial. The Smoking Man goes outside and tells the man who has been following them that Cobra has not shown. Scully finds a note under her dessert plate saying to meet at Calico Cove at dawn. She goes alone and is stopped by Cobra, who gives her a disc before being shot and killed by a sniper. The sniper also attempts to kill Scully, but is killed by The Smoking Man.|$|E

His first {{goal of the}} season came in the club's 2–1 home win against Rushden & Diamonds, scoring {{from the edge of}} the area to give Stevenage the lead. He also provided an assist in the club's 3–2 away fixture against Mansfield Town at Field Mill, as Stevenage came from two goals down to win the match. A week later, Bostwick scored a volley away at Chester City, although due to Chester City being expelled from the league, Bostwick's goal, and subsequently Stevenage's 1–0 win, were removed from the records. Bostwick continued his goalscoring form, scoring from 25yards after a well-worked corner in injury time, in a 4–0 win against Hayes & Yeading United. He scored a similar goal against Gateshead in November 2009, his fifth of the season. His next goal came in March 2010, scoring the opener from 30yards against Crawley Town as Stevenage won 2–0, and he scored another goal two weeks later, heading in an Andy Drury corner as Stevenage came from behind to win 2–1 at Grays Athletic. Bostwick also played in the club's 2–0 win against Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough in April 2010 – the match that secured Stevenage's place in the Football League for the first time in the club's history. He played in five of the club's FA Trophy fixtures during the 2009–10 season, scoring once in a match against Dover Athletic in January 2010. He also played in the Final at Wembley Stadium, but was unable to record a third Wembley victory as Stevenage lost 2–1 to Barrow after extra-time. In total, Bostwick played 52 matches in all competitions, scoring eight times. At the end of the season, Bostwick was out of contract and Westley announced that he expected him to leave, saying it would be [...] "very difficult" [...] to keep <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> However, in June 2010, Bostwick signed a new two-year deal with Stevenage, despite attracting interest from several League One clubs.|$|E

2500|$|Nearly {{two years}} later, Carey was named referee of Super Bowl XLII. On working the NFL's {{championship}} game, Carey {{said it was}} a [...] "personal honor" [...] and understood the historical significance of being the first African American referee. On the significance of the event, he {{said it was a}} [...] "great sign of the evolution of our society that all barriers are eroding". During the fourth quarter, Carey's judgment was a factor in one of the important plays of the game. On third down, with just over a minute left in regulation, New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning received the snap in a shotgun formation and looked to pass the ball. New England Patriots defenders Richard Seymour, Jarvis Green, and Adalius Thomas grabbed and attempted to tackle Manning. Manning escaped the two defenders and threw a 32-yard pass to wide receiver David Tyree. Under NFL rules, officials are required to stop play when a player is [...] "in the grasp and control" [...] of the defense. Carey determined that [...] "grasp and control" [...] was never achieved since Manning's forward momentum did not stop. Speaking about the play, Carey said, [...] "I anticipated a sack. I didn't assume that was going to happen, but rarely do you see a quarterback escape when he's got that much weight on his back and being dragged by two or three guys who had a <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> I could see [...] head was just straight ahead.

2500|$|In 1978, the Football Association {{lifted the}} {{restriction}} on foreign {{players in the}} Football League. Avramović was scouted by Notts County manager Jimmy Sirrel, who claimed he had found [...] "a goalie who would {{keep them in the}} Second Division" [...] and persuaded his chairman Jack Dunnet to pay a club record £200,000 for his transfer. Sirrel took Avramović under his personal care, and would later regard the player as one of his best players. At the beginning of the player’s career at Notts County, there was a social function at which Avramović went around and bought all his new teammates a drink as a friendly gesture. A local reporter saw this and wrote a newspaper article about Avramović being a [...] "boozer" [...] and a [...] "big-time-Charlie". The next time that same reporter went to Meadow Lane, Sirrel physically caught <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> and had him thrown off the premises and banned from the ground. The Evening Post had to give the reporter the Nottingham Forest job whilst the City Ground reporter switched over to Notts County. On 4 August 1979, he played his first competitive game for the club against Mansfield Town in a Anglo-Scottish Cup qualifier. He made his league debut against Cardiff City on 18 August, with his side running out 4–1 winners. The Magpies finished 17th in the league in that season but gained promotion to the First Division by claiming the runners-up spot in the 1980–81 season, with Avramović contributing with 16 clean sheets. In the first season of the club's return to the top flight after 54 years, Avramović played in all 42 league games as they defeated Arsenal 2–1 in October and beat defending champions Aston Villa 1–0.
