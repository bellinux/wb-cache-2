5000|$|In {{the season}} two episode, [...] "Morality Bites", Piper travels ten {{years into the}} future from the year 1999 and inhabits her future self's body. In the episode, Piper discovers that in ten years time, her <b>freezing</b> <b>power</b> becomes ten times {{stronger}} allowing her to instantly freeze an entire city block. After returning to the present, Piper never realizes the growth of this level of power before the series comes to an end.|$|E
5000|$|As Piper {{first comes}} into her powers, the first power she {{develops}} {{is the ability}} to slow down molecular motion so that objects, people, and even energy discharges instantly freeze in place. In the Charmed series, certain magical powers are attached to emotional triggers, although all powers can be affected by the user's emotions. For Piper, the emotional trigger for her <b>freezing</b> <b>power</b> is panic induced situations which enact a fear response. At first Piper would freeze everything in the immediate area whenever startled. Gradually, Piper learned to control this ability and freeze everything in the immediate area by a conscious act of will and gesturing. She must be able to gesture to activate her <b>freezing</b> <b>power</b> and cannot do so without using her hands. Piper also learns to selectively freeze specific objects of her choosing, rather than everything in the entire area. When Piper was new to her powers, objects she froze would eventually regain their mobility on their own, usually after several seconds. She later learns to unfreeze at will, even freezing an entire object, then unfreezing only part of it. This {{can be seen in the}} season three episode, [...] "Sleuthing with the Enemy", at which point Piper freezes a Zohtar demon named Krell (Scott MacDonald) in midair, then unfreezes his head in order to interrogate him.|$|E
50|$|The mass of {{an object}} {{seems to be no}} {{restriction}} on her power. Instead, the limitation of her <b>freezing</b> <b>power</b> appears to be determined {{by the size of the}} area, and she can freeze anything (except those entities immune to her powers) in the area of effect. The exact limitation has never been determined. Indoors, however, Piper is limited by the room she is in. She can freeze objects in the same room and cannot freeze anything outside the room, unless she has an unobstructed path to those objects, such as through an open door or window. Certain entities have proven resistant or immune to her freezing ability, such as ghosts, furies, and certain demons and warlocks. However, as the series progresses, less and less enemies are immune to her power as it grows to the point that even The Triad, very powerful upper-level demons are frozen by it during the Charmed Ones final confrontation with their physical selves. Notably, unlike how one proved vulnerable to her combustion power, this was while the Triad was still at full power though they were seen to be starting to unfreeze before Piper unfroze them herself.|$|E

After finding out {{it was all a}} trick, the Makamou then attack Ibuki, who is quickly aided by Kabuki and Touki, the latter making quick work of the couple with his <b>freezing</b> <b>power.</b> But the Orochi then shows up and forces the Oni to leave the battle as the Douji and Hime threaten the villagers for their attempted defiance by giving them a month to redeem themselves or suffer the plague that they have inflicted on the girl. After Kirameki arrives too late for the fight, the group sets out to gain more partners. As the Douji and Hime discuss how to deal with their eventual meddling, the Oni group make a stop in a village, with Asumu following them until he is attacked by a group of Samurai and unknowingly being saved by Hibiki. The group then learn of Nishiki, the Oni thief who is to be executed for his crimes. The group comes to witness his public beheading, but Nishiki surprises everyone by catching the sword to be used in his beheading with his teeth. He then escapes and joins the group, who are being watched by a young girl {{that turns out to be}} a Makamou named Hitotsumi who specializes in killing Oni.|$|E
5000|$|In late season three, Piper gains {{the ability}} to cause objects or evil beings to spontaneously explode using her hands. As {{explained}} by Leo in the episode [...] "Exit Strategy", [...] "Piper's powers work by slowing down molecules, and apparently now she can speed them up as well." [...] Unlike her <b>freezing</b> <b>power,</b> this new ability is triggered by anger and frustration, but is also controllable by conscious act of will and hand gestures. She also proves able to cause magical energy discharges and even living entities to explode. However, the limitations on her explosive power are even less clear than those of her freezing ability, but appear {{to be determined by}} an object's size and durability. The largest object she ever caused to explode was a truck door entrance to a warehouse. It once took her four tries to break down a much smaller gate, although this object was magically reinforced. Over the course of the series, Piper's power grows to the point that even the most powerful demons are affected by it; she is able to vanquish Jeric, an Egyptian demon so powerful that in the past his enemies were only able to mummify him. She was also able to vanquish one of The Triad, three very powerful demons who had no known way of vanquishing them with just three hits from the power, albeit after he was weakened by the vanquish of one of his comrades. In later seasons, she also displayed {{the ability to}} deflect enemy attacks back at them in a similar way to telekinesis.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study the thermal resistances of two components of a thermoelectric ice maker installed in a no-frost refrigerator, in order to optimize the ice production. This study is conducted via a computational model developed by the Thermal and Fluids Research Group from Public University of Navarre, explained and validated in previous papers. Firstly, three dissipaters with different space between fins are simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamics Fluent to study their influence on both the ice production and the performance of the refrigerator. The computational model predicts a maximum production of 2. 82 kg/day of ice with less than 7 W of extra electric power consumption, though these values depend to a great extent on the cooling and <b>freezing</b> <b>power</b> of the refrigerator. Secondly, this work focuses on reducing the size of the components in order to save raw material and reduce the cost of the device. The computational model predicts that the last design produces 2. 42 kg/day of ice, saves 65 % of raw material and reduces to the half the expenses assigned to the thermoelectric modules...|$|E

40|$|Freezing of gait (FOG) is an incapacitating {{problem in}} Parkinson's disease that is {{difficult}} to manage therapeutically. We tested the hypothesis that impaired rhythm and amplitude control is a common mechanism of freezing which is also present during other rhythmic tasks. Therefore, we compared the occurrence and spatiotemporal profiles of freezing episodes during upper limb motion, lower limb motion, and FOG. Eleven freezers, 12 non-freezers, and 11 controls performed a rhythmic bilateral finger movement task. The triggering effect of movement speed, amplitude, and coordination pattern was evaluated. Regression slopes and spectral analysis addressed the spatial and temporal kinematic changes inherent to freezing episodes. The FOG Questionnaire score significantly predicted severity of upper limb freezing, present in 9 freezers, and of foot freezing, present in 8 freezers. Similar to gait, small-amplitude movements tended to trigger upper limb freezing, which was preceded by hastened movement and a strong amplitude breakdown. Upper limb <b>freezing</b> <b>power</b> spectra were broadband, including increased energy in the "freeze band" (3 - 8 Hz). Contrary to FOG, unilateral upper limb freezing was common and occurred mainly on the disease-dominant side. The findings emphasize that a core motor problem underlies freezing which can affect various movement effectors. This deficit may originate on the disease-dominant body side and interfere with amplitude and timing regulation during repetitive limb movements. These results may shift current thinking on the origins of freezing as being not exclusively a gait failure. ¬© 2011 Movement Disorder Society. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Studies with Doppler ultrassonography {{started at}} the end of the 90 s for the {{determination}} of physiological and pathological alterations in the reproductive tract of the mare. Uterine alterations caused by inflammation, response from seminal plasma infusion, hormonal variations during estrous and diestrus, pregnancy and action of various vasoactive factors influence on the vascular perfusion detected by Doppler ultrasound. The development of efficient methods for uterine quality evaluation is of big importance for field equine reproduction veterinarians, once uterine environment is responsible for pregnancy maintenance. Review: Nowadays, the most used methods of uterine evaluation are the mode B ultrassonography, cytology, culture and biopsy. Hemodynamic evaluation of the uterus can be done by spectral data collected from large vessels, as A. uterine and its ramifications, or from subjective or objective evaluations from endometrium, miometrium and mesometrium attachment, which provide data referent to local and specific alterations of the evaluated area. Alterations in uterine vascular perfusion has been detected during estrous cycle, during pregnancy and in cases of infusion of inflammatory substances. These alterations happen because of vasoactive substances that act in the uterus during these events, however, most of these vasoactive substances are probably not even known. Also, important hemodynamic alterations in old mares, as an increase in vascular resistance, have been described. This increase might result from fibrosis of the uterus and in women it is considered to be a cause of infertility. In mares, periglandular fibrosis of the endometrium is considered to be the major diagnosable cause of embryonic and fetal loss in older mares. For the CL, ovarian artery of the mare supplies the ovary as well as the oviduct and therefore can be used for evaluation of these areas. The CL evaluation can also be done by the percentage of luteum area with colored signals as an indicator of the extent of blood flow. The percentage of the CL area with colored signals is determined subjectively by images observations in real time and/or by a <b>freezing</b> <b>Power</b> Doppler cross-section image with the maximum number of color pixels taped and the total number of color pixels is assessed by a computer analysis system. Therefore, a high correlation between plasmatic progesterone and CL vascularization also allows the CL evalution by this technique. In a first report, CL circulation reached its maximum on D 5, the progesterone concentration in peripheral blood increased until D 7 and in a posterior report, maximum perfusion was achieved two days after the maximum progesterone concentration (D 8). Blood flow reduced between D 10 -D 14 some days before the plasma progesterone decrease and, during the luteolytic period (D 15 -D 17), the decline in CL blood-flow area was greater than blood flow decrease. Conclusion: Doppler ultrassonography add knowledge about uterine viability and CL functionality can be easily used by veterinarians in the field. It is a noninvasive method that provides real time results. However, because of the short time studies in this area have been done, many other answers still need to be found until normal and pathological patterns will be established...|$|E

25|$|The major {{disadvantage}} to the DSSC {{design is}} the use of the liquid electrolyte, which has temperature stability problems.

Another disadvantage is that costly ruthenium (dye), platinum (catalyst) and conducting glass or plastic (contact) are needed to produce a DSSC. A third major drawback is that the electrolyte solution contains volatile organic compounds (or VOC's), solvents which must be carefully sealed as they are hazardous to human health and the environment.
