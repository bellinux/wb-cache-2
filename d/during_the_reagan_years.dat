5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>years,</b> Kemp and his {{followers}} ignored budget balancing while promoting tax cuts and economic growth. These tax cuts have been credited by conservatives for the economic growth from 1983 to 1990, which by 1996 {{had become one of}} the longest expansions in American history. Kemp notes that Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's success at stemming inflation and the favorable regulatory environment were also major factors.

2500|$|Spending <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>Reagan</b> budgeted (FY 1982â€“89) {{averaged}} 21.6% GDP, roughly {{tied with}} President Obama {{for the highest}} among any recent President. Each faced a severe recession early in their administration. In addition, the public debt rose from 26% GDP in 1980 to 41% GDP by 1988. In dollar terms, the public debt rose from $712 billion in 1980 to $2.052 trillion in 1988, a roughly three-fold increase. [...] The unemployment rate rose from 7% in 1980 to 11% in 1982, then declined to 5% in 1988. The inflation rate declined from 10% in 1980 to 4% in 1988.|$|R
25|$|Computers and {{the first}} laser printer were added during the Carter administration, {{and the use of}} {{computer}} technology was expanded during the Reagan administration.

25|$|With Ronald Reagan's {{victory in}} 1980 the modern American {{conservative}} movement took power. Republicans {{took control of}} the Senate {{for the first time since}} 1954, and conservative principles dominated Reagan's economic and foreign policies, with supply side economics and strict opposition to Soviet Communism defining the Administration's philosophy. Reagan's ideas were largely espoused and supported by the conservative Heritage Foundation, which grew dramatically in its influence <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>years,</b> extended to a second term by the 1984 presidential election, as Reagan and his senior aides looked to Heritage for policy guidance.|$|E
25|$|According to a 1996 {{study by}} the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, on 8 of the 10 key {{economic}} variables examined, the American economy performed better <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>years</b> than during the pre- and post-Reagan years. Real median family income grew by $4,000 during the Reagan period after experiencing no growth in the pre-Reagan years; it experienced a loss of almost $1,500 in the post-Reagan years. Interest rates, inflation, and unemployment fell faster under Reagan than they did immediately before or after his presidency. The only economic variable that was lower during period than in both the pre- and post-Reagan years was the savings rate, which fell rapidly in the 1980s. The productivity rate was higher in the pre-Reagan years but lower in the post-Reagan years.|$|E
50|$|Fish {{is perhaps}} best known for his work revitalizing The Nation magazine, and its sister foundation, the Nation Institute. In 1977, Fish teamed up with Victor Navasky and began the work of {{recruiting}} investors to acquire the magazine, then in receivership. Together {{with the help of a}} group of limited partners that included E.L. Doctorow, Norman Lear, Alan Sagner, and Dorothy Schiff, Fish and Navasky began a decade-long partnership as Publisher and Editor of the country's oldest political weekly. During their stewardship, The Nation experienced steady growth, modernized its publishing operation, prospered in many respects <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Ronald <b>Reagan</b> <b>years,</b> and caused a measure of mayhem worthy of an independent political journal. The magazine waged an honorable if lonely battle over the history of the Cold War, lost a landmark lawsuit over the protection of copyright in the Supreme Court of the United States, and convened large scale conferences including the 1981 Writers' Congress, which examined the status of writers and their representation (and spawned the National Writers Union); as well as the Dialogo de Todas Las Americas, to establish a cultural and political discourse between north and south as a counter to the interventionist doctrine of <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>years.</b> In 1987, Fish transferred his interest in the magazine to Arthur Carter, a New York investor who had started the Litchfield County Times and who succeeded Mr. Fish as The Nation's Publisher.|$|R

500|$|Some {{hardcore}} punk bands made {{a conscious}} decision to avoid putting Reagan in their lyrics. In wanting his music to outlast the administration, [...] Washington, D.C. musician Ian MacKaye, who was in the bands Minor Threat, Embrace, Pailhead, and Fugazi <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>years,</b> has said, [...] "I remember clearly resisting the urge to put the word 'Reagan' in any of the songs". In the late 1980s U.S. skinheads spearheaded a patriotic right-wing faction within the New York hardcore scene, and although bands like Agnostic Front and Cro Mags did not reference the president directly in their lyrics, their support of Reagan fell within their interpretation of patriotic backlash that reimagined hardcore without the antiestablishment ethos of punk rock. Some groups' stances on the president were a bit more ambiguous. When the drunk-rock group Murphy's Law praised Reagan and his films in their 1986 song [...] "California Pipeline," [...] fans could take it as either actual pro-Republican patriotism, or a tongue-in-cheek take on anti-Reagan irony. By the late 1980s, reference to Reagan in hardcore music had become so commonplace that the joke was no longer on the president, but on a punk scene where bands were practically obliged to put a Reagan song on their setlist or album.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{have criticized}} {{elements}} of Reaganomics {{on the basis}} of equity. For example, economist John Kenneth Galbraith believed that the Reagan administration actively used the Laffer curve [...] "to lower taxes on the affluent". Some critics point out that tax revenues almost always rise every year, and during Reagan's two terms increases in tax revenue were more shallow than increases during presidencies where top marginal tax rates were higher. Critics also point out that since the Reagan tax cuts, income has not significantly increased {{for the rest of the}} population. [...] This assertion is supported by studies that show the income of the top 1% nearly doubling <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>years,</b> while income for other income levels increased only marginally; income actually decreased for the bottom quintile.|$|E

2500|$|In {{stating that}} his {{intention}} was to lower taxes, Reagan's approach was a departure from his immediate predecessors. Reagan enacted lower marginal tax rates as well as simplified income tax codes and continued deregulation. During Reagan's presidency, the annual deficits averaged 4.2% of GDP after inheriting an annual deficit of 2.7% of GDP in 1980 under president Carter. The real (inflation adjusted) rate of growth in federal spending fell from 4% under Jimmy Carter to 2.5% under Ronald Reagan. GDP per working-age adult had increased at only a 1.15% annual rate <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Carter administration; increased at a 1.8% rate <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> administration. <b>The</b> increase in productivity growth was even higher: output per hour in the business sector had been roughly constant in the Carter years, increased at a 1.4% rate in <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>years.</b> However, Federal net outlays as percent of Gross Domestic Product was higher under Ronald Reagan than under Jimmy Carter ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Reagan</b> {{coalition}} was <b>the</b> {{combination of}} voters that Republican Ronald Reagan assembled {{to produce a}} major political realignment with his landslide in the 1980 United States Presidential Election. In 1980 <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> coalition was possible because of Democrat Jimmy Carter's losses in most social-economic groups. In 1984 Reagan confirmed his support by winning nearly 60% {{of the popular vote}} and carried 49 of the 50 states. <b>The</b> <b>Reagan</b> Democrats were Democrats before <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>years,</b> and afterwards, but who voted for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 (and for George H. W. Bush in 1988), producing their landslide victories. They were mostly white, socially conservative blue-collar workers, who lived in the Northeast, and were attracted to Reagan's social conservatism on issues such as abortion, and to his hawkish foreign policy. They did not continue to vote Republican in 1992 or 1996, so the term fell into disuse except as a reference to the 1980s. The term is not generally used to describe the southern whites who permanently changed party affiliation from Democrat to Republican <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> administration, and they have largely remained Republican to this day.|$|R
