50|$|<b>Ioxaglic</b> <b>acid</b> (trade name Hexabrix) is an iodine {{containing}} molecule {{used as a}} low-osmolality contrast medium.|$|E
30|$|In contrast, lidocain {{hydrochloride}} and, {{even more}} <b>ioxaglic</b> <b>acid,</b> {{had a more}} marked effect on the cross-linked HA viscosity than on the linear one, most likely {{as a result of}} secondary interactions with HA due to the ionic charge and/or pH.|$|E
30|$|The {{effect of}} the iodinated {{contrast}} agent on the viscosity was clearly volume-dependent, and depended on the formulation of the viscosupplement. Up to a ratio of 1 : 1, the viscosity of the linear HA remained above the dilution effect. Beyond this ratio, <b>ioxaglic</b> <b>acid</b> had a similar effect {{to that of the}} buffer. On the cross-linked HA, the deleterious {{effect of the}} contrast agent appeared from 1 : 1 and became very significant at a 1 : 2 ratio. Visual observation shew that, regardless of the HA, there was a separation phase for the 1 : 4 ratio. At all dilution levels and regardless of the diluents, the viscosity of the cross-linked viscosupplement remained much higher than that of the linear HA.|$|E
40|$|The iodinated x-ray {{contrast}} media (ICM) are the most widely administered intravascular pharmaceuticals and are known to persist in the aquatic environment. A rapid method using direct injection liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (DI-LC-MS/MS) has been developed to measure eight ICM. These include iopamidol, iothalamic acid, diatrizoic acid, iohexol, iomeprol, iopromide, plus both <b>ioxaglic</b> <b>acid</b> and iodipamide, which have not previously reported in the literature. The LC-MS/MS fragmentation patterns obtained {{for each of the}} compounds are discussed and the fragments lost for each transition are identified. Matrix effects in post-RO water, MQ water, tap water and secondary effluent have also been investigated. The DI-LC-MS/MS method was validated on both secondary and tertiary treated wastewater, and applied to samples from an advanced activated sludge wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and a water recycling facility using microfiltration (MF) and reverse osmosis (RO) in Perth, Western Australia. As well as providing information of the efficacy for RO to remove specific ICM, these results also represent the first values of ICM published in the literature for Australia...|$|E
