In this study, we analyzed the seasonal and spatial variability of near-sea-surface chlorophyll-a concentrations and their corresponding modulation mechanisms by collocating satellite observations of eddies tracked during 1998 - 2007 in the South China Sea. We {{found that in}} winter, cyclonic eddies show significantly high chlorophyll-a in the eddy core relative to the periphery, suggesting regulation by an eddy-pumping mechanism. While in summer, chlorophyll-a values {{in the core of}} cyclonic eddies are comparable with those in the periphery, and dipole features of chlorophyll-a around cyclonic eddies are conspicuous, which is largely induced by horizontal <b>eddy</b> <b>advection.</b> For anticyclonic eddies, however, low chlorophyll-a in eddy cores compared with the periphery are consistently present over most of the year. The impact of <b>eddy</b> <b>advection</b> on chlorophyll-a distribution in anticyclonic eddies is not clear from the composite images in different seasons. Variability of chlorophyll-a {{to the west of the}} Luzon Strait and northwest of the Luzon Island demonstrate that phytoplankton biomass in these two regions is mainly controlled by an eddy-pumping mechanism. In the regions off the Vietnam coast, chlorophyll-a distributions are generally associated with horizontal <b>eddy</b> <b>advection.</b> This research highlights different mesoscale mechanisms affecting biological structures in the upper ocean, which can potentially disturb ocean biogeochemical cycling processes in the South China Sea...|$|E

Spatial structure of Chl-a anomalies to the seasonal cycle is examined in relation to altimeter eddy structure. Eddy propagation speeds and scales by the Rossby waves are also identified. Chl-a structure is evident during the spring bloom period with a scale around 460 km. Cold-core (cyclonic) rings correspond to areas of high Chl-a concentrations. Warm-core (anticyclonic) rings relate to areas of low Chl-a concentration. Chl-a anomalies and SLA have an overall modest negative correlation coefficient of r¼" 0. 45, which may imply the co-existence of both eddy pumping and <b>eddy</b> <b>advection</b> mechanisms in the KE region. Swirl currents between eddies redistribute surface chlorophyll concentrations and can spatially bias maximum and minimum concentration levels off eddy center. The correlation coefficient has seasonal fluctuations. In the western KE region, it varies from high negative correlation (r¼" 0. 70) in April and September (eddy pumping dominant) to low negative correlation (r¼" 0. 33) in February and March (<b>eddy</b> <b>advection</b> dominant). In the eastern KE region, it varies from high negative correlation (r¼" 0. 67) in February to low negative correlation (r¼" 0. 42) in December.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of the upper ocean thermal balance of an ocean-atmosphere coupled GCM to lateral ocean physics is assessed. Three 40 -year simulations are performed using horizontal mixing, isopycnal mixing, and isopycnal mixing plus <b>eddy</b> induced <b>advection.</b> The thermal adjustment of the coupled system is quite different between the simulations, confirming the major role of ocean mixing on the heat balance of climate. The initial adjustment phase of the upper ocean (SST) is used to diagnose the physical mechanisms involved in each parametrisation. When the lateral ocean physics is modified, significant changes of SST are seen, mainly in the southern ocean. A heat budget of the annual mixed layer (defined as the “bowl”) shows that these changes are due to a modified heat transfer between the bowl and the ocean interior. This modified heat intake of the ocean interior is directly due to the modified lateral ocean physics. In isopycnal diffusion, this heat exchange, especially marked at mid-latitudes, is both due to an increased effective surface of diffusion and to {{the sign of the}} isopycnal gradients of temperature {{at the base of the}} bowl. As this gradient is proportional to the isopycnal gradient of salinity, this confirms the strong role of salinity in the thermal balance of the coupled system. The <b>eddy</b> induced <b>advection</b> also leads to increased exchanges between the bowl and the ocean interior. This is both due to the shape of the bowl and again to the existence of a salinity structure. The lateral ocean physics is shown to be a significant contributor to the exchanges between the diabatic and the adiabatic parts of the ocean...|$|R

The balance between the variances and covariances of these terms is illustrated using a novel vector representation. It is shown that for most locations, {{as well as for the}} PNA pattern, the PV variability is dominantly driven by <b>advection.</b> The <b>eddy</b> forcing explains a small amount of the tendency variance.

40|$|There are two {{distinct}} {{mechanisms by which}} eddies provide systematic transport of tracer on isopycnals: the advective transport, associated with the slumping of isopycnals, and the diffusive transport, associated with down-gradient diffusion. Depending on the large-scale tracer distribution, eddy advective transport has either {{the same direction as}} or opposite direction to eddy diffusive transport. As a consequence, <b>eddy</b> <b>advection</b> and eddy diffusion can reinforce each other for some tracers but oppose each other for other tracers. Using scaling analysis, it is argued that the relative directions of eddy advective and diffusive transports can be determined simply from the relative slopes of tracers and isopycnals. An eddy-resolving (1 / 12 °) global ocean model is used to illustrate the two eddy transport mechanisms for temperature and salinity in the Southern Ocean. Applications to other tracers, such as oxygen, are discussed. The diagnosed eddy diffusivity for temperature (and salinity) is found to be considerably different from the eddy diffusivity for eddy advective transport velocity. <br/...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{importance}} of individual transport processes for the winter polar downward transport of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from the thermosphere to the mesosphere. The downward transport of NOx produced by energetic particle precipitation induces chemical alterations in the middle atmosphere and influences ozone chemistry. However, it remains unclear how much each transport process contributes to the downward transport. We use simulations of the atmospheric general circulation and chemistry model HAMMONIA (Hamburg Model of Neutral and Ionized Atmosphere) for the extended winter 2008 / 2009 with a passive tracer. The model enables us to separate the contributions of <b>advection,</b> <b>eddy</b> and molecular diffusion on the total transport by switching off processes. The results show that molecular diffusion and resolved vertical mixing due to advection effectively transport NOx to the mesosphere. While the impact of molecular diffusion on the transport rapidly decreases below 0. 001 hPa, the impact of advection increases. Around the central date of the sudden stratospheric warming in January 2009, advection is strongly enhanced in the thermosphere and mesosphere and the downward transport through the mesopause region is almost entirely driven by <b>advection.</b> <b>Eddy</b> diffusion has limited impact on the transport in the upper mesosphere and negligible impact on the transport in the thermosphere. If eddy diffusion is enhanced as suggested by observations, it can potentially have a larger impact on transport through the mesopause than was previously assumed...|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} view of equatorial dynamics {{requires that}} the zonal equatorial wind stress be balanced, in the mean, by the vertical integral of “large-scale” terms, such as the zonal pressure gradient, mesoscale eddy flux, and mean advection, over the upper few hundred meters. It is usually presumed that the surface wind stress is communicated to the interior by turbulent processes. Turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates measured at 140 °W during the TROPIC HEAT I experiment and a production rate–dissipation rate balance argument {{have been used to}} calculate the zonal turbulent stress at 30 to 90 m depth. The calculated turbulent stress at 30 m depth amounts to only 20 % of the wind stress and decreases exponentially with depth below 30 m. Typical large-scale estimates of the zonal pressure gradient, mesoscale <b>eddy</b> flux, and <b>advection</b> have a depth scale larger than the turbulent stress, and are inconsistent with the vertical divergence of the stress as estimated from the dissipation rate measurements. It is concluded that either 1) the measured estimates of dissipation rate are too small, 2) the actual large-scale zonal pressure gradient, mesoscale <b>eddy</b> flux, and <b>advection</b> during our observation period were highly atypical and had a very shallow depth scale, 3) some process other than the simple diffusion of momentum through shear instabilities is transporting the momentum, or 4) the assumption of a production-dissipation balance in the turbulent kinetic energy budget is incorrect.

It has been found that the effects of the <b>eddy</b> vertical <b>advection</b> of momentum, and the eddy dynamic pressure due to the eddy kinetic energy associated with cumulus clouds are rather small. The only important dynamic effect comes from the ability of clouds to produce a horizontal eddy flux of vertical vorticity.

In the vorticity equation, it appears in the form of generation of positive vorticity by convective elements in the lower levels, and generation of negative vorticity in the upper levels.

40|$|Interaction {{between the}} Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the {{continental}} slope/shelf in the Marguerite Bay and west Antarctic Peninsula is examined as interaction between a wind-driven channel flow and a zonally uniform slope with a bay-shaped shelf to the south. Two control mechanisms, <b>eddy</b> <b>advection</b> and propagation of topographic waves, are identified in barotropic vortex-escarpment interactions. The two mechanisms advect the potential vorticity (PV) perturbations {{in opposite directions}} in anticyclone-induced interactions {{but in the same}} direction in cyclone-induced interactions, resulting in dramatic differences in the two kinds of interactions. The topographic waves become more nonlinear near the western(eastern if in the Northern Hemisphere) boundary of the bay, where strong cross-escarpment motion occurs. In the interaction between a surface anticyclone and a slope penetrating into the upper layer in a two-layer isopycnal model, the <b>eddy</b> <b>advection</b> decays on length scales on the order of the internal deformation radius, so shoreward over a slope that is wider than the deformation radius, the wave mechanism becomes noticeably significant. It acts to spread the cross-isobath transport in a much wider range while the transport directly driven by the anticyclone is concentrated in space. A two-layer wind-driven channel flow is constructed {{to the north of the}} slope in the Southern Hemisphere, spontaneously generating eddies through baroclinic instability. A PV front forms in the first layer shoreward of the base of the topography due to the lower-layer eddy-slope interactions. (cont.) Perturbed by the jet in the center of the channel, the front interacts with the slope/shelf persistently yet episodically, driving a clockwise mean circulation within the bay as well as crossisobath transport. Both the transports across the slope edge and out of the bay are comparable with the maximum Ekman transport in the channel, indicative of the significance of the examined mechanism. The wave-boundary interaction identified in the barotropic model is found essential for the out-of-bay transport and responsible for the heterogeneity of the transport within the bay. Much more water is transported out of the bay from the west than from the east, and the southeastern area is the most isolated region. These results suggest that strong out-of-bay transport may be found near the western boundary of the Marguerite Bay while the southeastern region is a retention area where high population of Antarctic krill may be found. by Yu Zhang.

A 50 year climatological integration of an eddy-resolving numerical ocean model is {{used to assess the}} long-term persistence of striations. Automated eddy tracking algorithms are applied to the model outputs and altimetry data. Results reveal that striations coincide with both polarized eddy tracks and the offshore formation of new eddies in the subtropical front and coastal transition zone, without any significant decay over time that discards random eddies as a primary driver of the striations. Localized patches of vortex stretching and relative vorticity advection, alternating meridionally near {{the eastern edge of the}} subtropical front, are associated with topographic steering of the background flow in the presence of steep topography, and with baroclinically and barotropically unstable meridional flow.

Nutrient supply to the upper ocean by turbulent mixing is reexamined using local standard oceanographic measurements and high-resolution vertical profiles of nutrients averaged over a large region directly comparable to that investigated by Jenkins (1982). Turbulent fluxes induced by internal waves and salt fingering, respectively, are separated according to Gregg (1989) and Zhang et al. (1998). Nutrient transport into the nutrient-consuming surface layer by salt fingering is more than fivefold higher than transport due to internal-wave induced turbulence.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of an idealized bio-physical model of seasonally varying subtropical and subpolar gyres to increased horizontal resolution is presented. Switching from mesoscale-resolving (1 / 9 °) to submesoscale-resolving (1 / 54 °) allows {{the emergence of}} a denser and more energetic vortex population sustained by submesoscale physics. The experiments display a global decrease in phytoplankton abundance of ? 10 – 20 % as the resolution is refined. This result contrasts with previous studies, which suggested that eddy-driven vertical fluxes of nutrients locally boost phytoplankton growth at mid-latitudes in the open ocean. The explanation is that the long-term (50 years) modification of the large-scale, or basin-scale, circulation and distribution of nutrients by submesoscale processes (remote effects), not taken into account by previous studies because of their much shorter time integration, balance the local, small-scale effects. More precisely, dynamical remote effects (involving only the physics) affect the location of the boundary between the two gyres as well as the large-scale mixed-layer depth (MLD) and thermocline depth. Biological remote effects result from the dynamical remote effects that strongly modify the physical–biological interactions at all scales, including at large scales. These biological remote effects involve changes of the nutricline depth. In the mid-latitude subpolar gyre, phytoplankton decrease in abundance at higher resolution is due to the shallower MLD and nutricline, which promote zooplankton grazing; in the subtropical gyre, it is due to deeper MLD and nutricline, which diminishes regenerated production.

40|$|Sea surface {{salinity}} (SSS) {{from the}} Aquarius and SMOS satellite missions displays a steady increase of ~ 1 psu {{over the entire}} northwestern Atlantic shelf south of Nova Scotia during the 2011 - 2015. Put {{in the context of}} longer ocean profile data the results suggest that mixed layer salinity and temperature north of the Gulf Stream experience positively correlated shelf-wide interannual oscillations (1 psu/ 2 degC). Salty and warm events occur coincident with anomalous easterly-southeasterly winds and Ekman transport counteracting the mean southwestward shelf currents. They are coincident with the weakening of both branches of the Scotian Shelf Current (SSC), but only moderately correlate with shifts of the Gulf Stream North Wall. This suggests that salt advection by anomalous SSC acting on the mean salinity gradient is the primary driver regulating the transport of fresh/cold water from high latitudes. The advection mechanism imposes a connectedness of the larger-scale interannual variability in this region and its tie to atmospheric oscillations. In the second part, an analysis of 15 -year long numerical simulations is presented which show 8 interannual salinity oscillations (positive and negative). Six of these are driven by the horizontal advection by slow varying currents (> 2 months), while 2 events are driven by the horizontal <b>eddy</b> <b>advection</b> (< 2 months). In line with observations, salt/warm model events correspond to anomalously weak SSC, correlate with southeasterly wind anomaly, and confirm that interannual horizontal salt advection drives the interannual salinity.

It is shown that both the trapping time for particles in the mixing region and the number of times their trajectories wind around the vortex have hierarchical fractal structure as functions of the initial particle's coordinates. Scattering functions are singular on a Cantor set of initial conditions, and this property should manifest itself by strong fluctuations of quantities measured in experiments.

Here, we explore the existence of similar structures in the ocean using satellite-derived estimates of sea surface temperature (SST) from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). Applying an ocean front detection algorithm globally to microwave measurements of SST, we find that repeated ocean fronts occur along quasi-zonal bands in a multiyear (2002 – 2011) average of detections. Such a pattern is also observed in SST gradient magnitude.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{magnetic}} fields constrain motions of charged particles, impeding the diffusion of charged particles perpendicular to magnetic field direction. This modification of transport processes is of vital importance {{for a wide variety of}} astrophysical processes including cosmic ray transport, transfer of heavy elements in the interstellar medium, star formation etc. Dealing with these processes one should keep in mind that in realistic astrophysical conditions magnetized fluids are turbulent. In this review we single out a single transport process, namely, heat transfer and consider how it occurs in the presence of the magnetized turbulence. We show that the ability of magnetic field lines to constantly change topology and connectivity is at the heart of the correct description of the 3 D magnetic field stochasticity in turbulent fluids. This ability is ensured by fast magnetic reconnection in turbulent fluids and puts forward the concept of reconnection diffusion at the core of the physical picture of heat transfer in astrophysical plasmas. Appealing to reconnection diffusion we describe the ability of plasma to diffuse between different magnetized eddies explaining the advection of the heat by turbulence. Adopting the structure of magnetic field that follows from the modern understanding of MHD turbulence, we also discuss thermal conductivity that arises as electrons stream along stochastic magnetic field lines. We compare the effective heat transport that arise from the two processes and conclude that in many astrophysically-motivated cased <b>eddy</b> <b>advection</b> of heat dominates. Finally, we discuss the concepts of sub and superdiffusion and show that the subdiffusion requires rather restrictive settings. At the same time, accelerated diffusion or superdiffusion of heat is possible on the scales less than the injection scale of the turbulence.

40|$|Approximately {{thirteen}} years of {{mean sea level}} anomaly (MSLA) and chlorophyll (Chl) data in the northern South China Sea (NSCS) were analysed to investigate {{the influence of a}} nonlinear, mesoscale eddy on ecological and bio-geochemical processes. Over two thousand mesoscale eddies were identified and tracked using a new sea surface height-based method and approximately 40 % of these eddies were nonlinear. A westward co-propagation of Chl and MSLA signals at a speed of approximately 0. 07 m s(- 1) was found to correspond well with the variability of Chl within cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. The covariability relationships were different depending on the season. The results of a lagged cross correlation between MSLA and Chl, as well as Chl composite averaging within mesoscale eddies, showed that <b>eddy</b> <b>advection</b> dominates the Chl dipole structure within mesoscale eddies. This mechanism was further confirmed by the significant correlations of the west-to-east Chl difference with background Chl gradient (R = 0. 32 for cyclonic eddies and R = - 0. 20 for anticyclonic eddies) and eddy scale (R = 033 for cyclonic eddies and R = - 0. 21 for anticyclonic eddies). Moreover, the strong correlation (0. 44) between the in-to-out Chl difference and amplitude for the cyclonic eddy implied that eddy pumping contributes to the high Chl levels near the centre of cyclonic eddy.

The distribution of odorants {{is inseparable from}} and temporally linked to advective movements and eddies within the fluid itself; therefore, animals that depend upon fluid-borne chemical signals for detecting food and other critical sources of chemical signals should possess nervous system elements tuned not only to rapid changes in odorant concentration but also to hydrodynamic shear within the fluid column.

The model is able to give a highly detailed description of all the phenomena that may arise in the water system, such as: mixing, transportation of the inlet substances (through <b>advection,</b> <b>eddy</b> diffusion, molecular diffusion), volatilisation in the tanks, reactions with substances contained in the water and/or present on the pipes' internal walls. The capabilities of the proposed model in order to evaluate the concentrations, in steady-state conditions, of non conservative substances in a water system have been already illustrated (Pianese et al., 1997).

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the variability of}} the spring phytoplankton bloom in the Labrador Sea, dividing into distinct biogeographical zones, then analyzing {{the relationship between the}} bloom and physical forcings. The spring phytoplankton bloom in the north Labrador Sea varied in intensity by a factor of 4 and in timing of onset by 3 weeks over the 11 -year record from SeaWiFS satellite ocean chlorophyll, 1998 – 2008. This north bloom (north of 60 °N and west of the Labrador shelves) is earliest and most intense, owing in part to the offshore-directed freshwater stratification from the West Greenland Current. On interannual timescales, significant correlations were found between the north bloom intensity and ocean processes, namely offshore <b>advection,</b> <b>eddy</b> activity and runoff from Greenland. In contrast, the central Labrador Sea is later and weaker, and only a correlation between the bloom timing and irradiance was found. As the subpolar gyre shifts in strength and shape, freshwater outflow from the Arctic and Greenland changes, we may expect further changes in the biological response as indicated by these relationships...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we use various {{diagnostic}} {{techniques to}} investigate the synoptic evolution of the Pacific–North American teleconnection pattern (PNA). National Center for Environment Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis data are used. These data cover the years 1948 – 2008 for the months of November–March. It is found that the positive PNA is initiated by enhanced convection over the western tropical Pacific and weakened convection over the tropical Indian Ocean. The excitation of the negative PNA exhibits opposite features. For both phases, the response to tropical convection excites a small-amplitude PNA about 8 – 12 days prior to the pattern attaining its maximum amplitude. This is followed by slow, steady growth for about 5 days, after which driving by synoptic scale waves, via their eddy vorticity flux, together with stationary <b>eddy</b> <b>advection</b> lead to much more rapid growth {{and the establishment of}} the full PNA. For the positive PNA, the synoptic scale waves propagate eastward into the midlatitude northeastern Pacific, where they are observed to undergo cyclonic wave breaking. For the negative PNA, the synoptic scale waves first amplify over the midlatitude northeastern Pacific and then propagate equatorward into the Subtropics where they undergo anticyclonic wave breaking. Once established, for both phases, the PNA appears to be maintained through a positive feedback that involves a succession of wave breakings. These results suggest that preconditioning may {{play an important role in}} the formation of the PNA. For the positive PNA, in its early development, the strengthening and eastward extension of the subtropical jet result in an increase in the cyclonic shear and a decrease in the meridional potential vorticity gradient, features that are known to favour cyclonic wave breaking. For the negative PNA, opposite changes were observed for the background flow, which favour equatorward wave propagation and anticyclonic wave breaking. The role of optimal growth is also discussed. Our results also suggest that the PNA is potentially predictable 1 – 2 weeks in advance. Copyright © 2011 Royal Meteorological Societ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{previous}} study on TC Dora (2007) {{in the southwest}} Indian Ocean gave some insight on the pathway to storm intensification under upper-level trough forcing. The French operational hydrostatic limited-area model at 8 -km resolution, Aladin-Reunion, allowed diagnoses of trough impacts in the TC core. The main mechanisms identified for vortex intensification were (a) PV superposition (associated with radial convergence of angular momentum) at mid and upper levels where unusual mean radial inflow was observed, followed by (b) secondary eyewall formation induced by eddy momentum flux convergence, eddy PV (or absolute vorticity) fluxes, and vertical velocity forcing from the trough, which contributed to mean and <b>eddy</b> vertical <b>advection</b> of the tangential wind in the outer eyewall. The predicted intensity evolution {{was consistent with the}} observed eyewall replacement cycle and intensification of TC Dora. The sensitivity of the interaction to the respective positions and strengths of the TC and the trough is now assessed. A hierarchy of sensitivity experiments is run with the same model in which the initial location and/or intensity of the storm are modified (through the assimilation of pseudo-wind observations). How robust is the formerly proposed paradigm for intensification under upper-level forcing when the geometry of the interaction is modified? How much does a weaker storm intensify under upper-level forcing compared to a stronger storm? Track and intensity verifications will be used as well as diagnostics regarding the interaction of the main two cyclonic PV anomalies associated with the trough and the TC at both mid and upper levels. PV budget and Eliassen-Palm fluxes will be compared to the reference simulation to investigate the robustness of intensification with respect to the relative locations and intensities of the storm and upper-level trough...|$|R

40|$|A {{parameterization}} for {{the spatial}} {{pattern of the}} <b>eddy</b> induced thickness <b>advection</b> parameter estimated from a dynamically consistent data assimilation procedure is presented. Values of the thickness advection parameter are predominantly negative (positive) over seamounts, and positive (negative) over the deep ocean in the southern (northern) hemisphere along strong currents; its magnitude is large at high latitudes but low in the tropical regions. Those characteristics motivate a parameterization based on the Coriolis parameter, the bottom depth and an eddy length scale. As a parameterization for an eddy streamfunction, the associated bolus velocities advect density anti-cyclonically (cyclonically) around seamounts (troughs). Although the parameterization has the same form as Holloway’s streamfunction for the Neptune effect, and is also related to eddy–topography interactions, Holloway’s streamfunction is in contrast applied to the momentum equation. The parameterization is independently confirmed by the flux-mean gradient relation from the output of a high resolution model. The effect of the proposed scheme is investigated using a channel model with idealized bottom topographies and a global ocean circulation model with realistic bottom topography. In agreement with the high resolution model, our scheme generates cold (warm) domes and cyclonic circulations over seamounts (troughs), {{which is consistent with}} the eddy movement in presence of the topographic β effect. This provides a different mechanism for eddy–topography interaction than the Neptune effect, which generates circulations of opposing sign...|$|R
40|$|International audienceContext. A hot vortex {{formed in}} the {{stratosphere}} of Saturn following the 2010 - 2011 Northern Storm. Huge temperature increases have been measured in the vortex around the millibar level. Enhancements in hydrocarbon abundances have been observed at the millibar level in 2011 - 2012 inside this vortex. Aims: We model the time-dependent photochemistry inside the vortex by accounting for the temperature variability over the period from January 2011 to March 2012 to assess whether photochemistry alone can explain the enhancements seen in the hydrocarbon abundances. Methods: We used a 1 D time-dependent photochemical model of Saturn and adapted it to the perturbed conditions of the vortex after validating it in quiescent conditions. Results: Our model predicts non-variability for ethane (C 2 H 6) and acetylene (C 2 H 2) {{and an increase in}} ethylene (C 2 H 4) by a factor of 3 in the mbar region. Heavier hydrocarbons show a stronger variability than the lighter ones. We are unable to reproduce the increase seen in C 2 H 2, and we significantly underestimate the increase seen in C 2 H 4. Conclusions: Pure photochemistry does not explain the variability seen in the abundance of most hydrocarbons. This means that dynamics (<b>eddy</b> diffusion and/or <b>advection)</b> must have {{played a significant role in}} shaping the vertical profiles of the main hydrocarbons...|$|R

Both high {{salinity}} anomalies ( 35. 2) and water properties from varying source regions are investigated using Seaglider data. Observed salinity anomalies that can exceed the average profile by up to 0. 3 occur approximately once a month and exist in the upper 50 m of the water column. Anomalies coincide {{with the presence of}} a cyclonic eddy both north and south of the main Hawaiian Islands. The eddy south of the islands outcrops the 100 − 120 m isotherms lifting high salinity water (subsurface salinity maxima) to the surface. Eddy interaction and eddy-island interaction cause deformation of the cyclonic <b>eddies</b> resulting in <b>advection</b> of the high salinity water away from the eddy, along equipotential surfaces, into the study site. For two sites (PacIOOS and ALOHA), the mean regional profiles calculated by Lumpkin [1998] were compared to observed T-S relationships. A RMS calculation was used to identify regions with the most similar water properties. While the entire profile is used in the comparison, most of the variation is in the upper waters (especially at ALOHA) with a secondary STD maximum at PacIOOS at the salinity minimum. Surprisingly, variation indictive of multiple source regions was found at both sites. Of particular interest, most of the observed water properties at PacIOOS (60 %) match those found north of the islands.
