2500|$|A common way to {{test whether}} an innate jealousy {{response}} exists between sexes {{is to use a}} forced-choice questionnaire. This style of questionnaire asks participants [...] "Yes or No" [...] and [...] "Response A or Response B" [...] style questions about certain scenarios. For example, a question might ask, [...] "If you found your partner cheating on you would you be more upset by (A) the sexual involvement or (B) the emotional involvement". As the name implies, one is forced to choose between the two options. Many studies using <b>forced</b> <b>choice</b> questionnaires have found statistically significant results supporting an innate sex difference between men and women. [...] Furthermore, studies have shown that this observation holds across many cultures, although the magnitudes of the sex difference vary within sexes across cultures.|$|E
2500|$|In her meta-analysis, Harris (2003) {{raises the}} {{question}} of whether <b>forced</b> <b>choice</b> questionnaires actually measure what they purport: jealousy itself and evidence that differences in jealousy arise from innate mechanisms. Her meta-analysis reveals that sex-differences are almost exclusively found in forced-choice studies. According to Harris, a meta-analysis of multiple types of studies should indicate a convergence of evidence and multiple operationalizations. This is not the case, which {{raises the question}} as to the validity of forced-choice studies. DeSteno and Bartlett (2002) further support this argument by providing evidence which indicates that significant results of forced-choice studies may actually be an artifact of measurement; this finding would invalidate many of the claims made by those [...] "in favor" [...] of an [...] "innate" [...] sex difference. Even those [...] "in favor" [...] of sex-differences admit that certain lines of research, such as homicide studies, suggest against the possibility of sex-differences.|$|E

2500|$|Macropsia is {{generally}} diagnosed once a patient complains of the characteristic symptoms, such as disproportionally large objects in their visual field. The Amsler Grid test {{can be used}} to diagnose macropsia, along with other visual maladies depending on the subjective disturbance reported by the patient after looking at the Amsler Grid. Outward bulging of the lines on an Amsler Grid is consistent with patients experiencing macropsisa. [...] The New Aniseikonia Test (NAT) can quantify the degree of macropsia or micropsia independently in the vertical and horizontal meridians. The test consists of red and green semicircles on a black background with a white round fixation target. [...] The size of the red semicircle is held constant while the green semicircle is varied in size in 1% increments. The patient wears a pair of red/green goggles so that one eye is tested at a time, and the patient attempts to determine when the semicircles are the same size. [...] This is termed the reversal threshold and the size difference between the semicircles is reported as the degree of aniseikonia. [...] A positive value indicates that the object was perceived bigger and thus corresponds to macropsia, and conversely a negative value indicates micropsia. [...] The Aniseikonia Inspector contains an aniseikonia test based on the same principles as the NAT, but the test is run on a computer screen, it is based on a <b>forced</b> <b>choice</b> method, and it can measure the size difference {{as a function of the}} size of the objects. The functionality of being able to measure the size difference as function of the size (i.e. field dependent testing) is especially important when the macropsia (or micropsia) has a retinal origin.|$|E

40|$|Many {{psychophysics}} {{investigations have}} implemented pre-cues to direct an observer's {{attention to a}} specific location or feature. There is controversy over the mechanisms of involuntary attention and whether perceptual or decision processes can enhance target detection and identification as measured by accuracy judgments. Through four main experiments, this dissertation {{research has indicated that}} both involuntary and voluntary attention improve target identification and localization accuracy even when cues are non-predictive. The first experiment was conducted to assess the validity of the mask-dependent cueing hypothesis and to determine if involuntary attention improves target identification accuracy. A two-alternative <b>force</b> <b>choice</b> experimental procedure using the method of constant stimuli was conducted using non-predictive cues and both masked and unmasked target stimuli. The results indicated that involuntary attention improved target identification accuracy for unmasked stimuli across the entire Weibull psychometric function. The second experiment introduced multinomial modeling of observed data to assess the extent of response bias which has been shown to confound cueing experiments. In a seven-alternative <b>force</b> <b>choice</b> experiment, observers reported both the location and identification of masked stimuli presented across a range of temporal parameters spanning the time course of both voluntary and involuntary attention. The multinomial modeling removed the response bias and the results indicated a strong cueing effect for both voluntary and involuntary spatial attention. The third experiment used the same multinomial modeling technique to remove response bias, but stimuli were unmasked and 6 stimulus contrast levels were tested ranging from 19 % to 100 % contrast. Results indicated strong cueing effects across the entire psychometric function. The fourth experiment was a six-alternative <b>force</b> <b>choice</b> feature-attention task in which observers reported the identity and location of target stimuli following a feature cue. The results indicated that under both involuntary and voluntary attention, response accuracy was increased. The combined results indicate that accuracy is enhanced with voluntary and involuntary attention for both feature-based and visuo-spatial attention using non-predictive cues...|$|R

Both options can be presented concurrently or sequentially in two intervals (also known as two-interval <b>forced</b> <b>choice,</b> 2IFC). The term 2AFC is often mistakenly used for describing the more common yes-no task, where a subject is presented with one option only and is forced to choose whether it belongs to one or another category. 2AFC {{is a method}} of psychophysics developed by Gustav Theodor Fechner.|$|E

40|$|Dorsolateral and frontopolar prefrontal cortices (PFCs) {{are often}} implicated in neuroimaging studies of memory retrieval, with this {{activity}} ascribed to controlled monitoring processes indicative of difficult or demanding retrieval. Difficulty, however, is multiply determined, with success rates governed {{both by the}} available evidence and {{by the nature of}} decision rules applied to that evidence. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we isolated these factors by 1) contrasting different decision rules across matched evidence and 2) manipulating the level of evidence within a fixed decision rule. For identically constructed retrieval probes (1 old and 1 new item), same [...] different (are these different?) compared with <b>forced</b> [...] <b>choice</b> (which one is old?) decision rules yielded bilateral dorsolateral and right frontopolar PFC increases. However, these regions were unaffected when the available evidence was greatly lowered within <b>forced</b> [...] <b>choice</b> decisions.
