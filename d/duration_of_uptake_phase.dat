40|$|Few {{data are}} {{available}} on the comparative accumulation of metal(loid) s from water and food in estuarine/marine fish. Smooth toadfish (Tetractenos glaber), commonly found in estuaries in south-eastern Australia, were separately exposed to radio-labelled seawater (14 kBq L- 1 of 109 Cd and 24 kBq g- 1 75 Se) and food (ghost shrimps; Trypaea australiensis: 875 Bq g- 1 109 Cd and 1130 Bq g- 1 75 Se) for 25 days (<b>uptake</b> <b>phase),</b> followed by exposure to radionuclide-free water or food for 30 days (loss phase). Toadfish accumulated 109 Cd predominantly from water (85 %) and 75 Se predominantly from food (62 %), although the latter was lower than expected. For both the water and food exposures, 109 Cd was predominantly located in the gut lining (60 e 75 %) at the end <b>of</b> the <b>uptake</b> <b>phase,</b> suggesting that the gut may be the primary pathway <b>of</b> 109 Cd <b>uptake.</b> This may be attributed to toadfish drinking large volumes of water to maintain osmoregulation. By the end of the loss phase, 109 Cd had predominantly shifted to the excretory organs e the liver (81 %) in toadfish exposed to radio-labelled food, and in the liver, gills and kidney (82 %) of toadfish exposed to radio-labelled water. In contrast, 75 Se was predominantly located in the excretory organs (gills, kidneys and liver; 66 e 76 %) at the end <b>of</b> the <b>uptake</b> <b>phase,</b> irrespective <b>of</b> the exposure pathway, with minimal change in percentage distribution (76 - 83 %) after the loss phase.

30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{another issue}} potentially influencing {{the accuracy of}} 15 O-water PET activation studies of the auditory system is scanning duration. Shorter as well as longer acquisition durations have been proposed. Kanno et al. [50] demonstrated an increase of signal to noise (S/N) ratio with acquisition time. In the mean, they found S/N ratio to be about 1 / 3 higher at 120  s compared to 40  s scan time. On the other hand, Volkow et al. [51] showed the largest activations in the occipital cortex due to light stimulation based on acquisitions during “uptake phase” (the initial 30 – 35  s). Moreover, they demonstrated that activations depend on the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> stimulation. Continued stimulation after the peak <b>of</b> <b>uptake</b> <b>phase</b> for further 40  s during the “washout phase” resulted into lower uptake compared to stimulation restricted to the <b>uptake</b> <b>phase.</b> The authors explained this observation and also lower activation with longer acquisitions by increased clearance of radioactivity from areas of high blood flow. In our study, {{we did not observe}} a significant difference in activation height (Tmax) dependent on the acquisition duration (60 vs. 90  s). This is particularly in contrast to a study by Silbersweig et al. [52] reporting improved significance (greater signal to noise ratio and higher Z-score) of results obtained with 90  s compared to 60  s. One reason for these conflicting results might be differences in the injection procedure—particularly with respect to the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the bolus injection. Silbersweig et al. [52] described a slow bolus injection (over 20  s), which is considerably slower compared to Volkow’s and our study (3 and 7  s, respectively). A slower injection might promote improved results with longer acquisition durations. Thus, a final conclusion with respect to the most favorable scan duration is not yet possible based on the presently available data. Nevertheless, future studies employing modern PET equipment with the capability of list mode acquisition enabling flexible retrospective definition of reconstructed time frames would allow to address this issue more precisely. Furthermore, due to achievements in PET technique like time of flight measurements, an enhanced signal to noise ratio for a given acquisition duration can be expected [24]. Finally, this will help to adapt the acquisition duration rather on biological/physiological grounds than on technical limitations of the scanner for improved results of PET activation studies.|$|R

30|$|Based on our results, and {{the fact}} that all SPCCT reconstructed images have a 100 % spatial {{registration}} [13], using multiple contrast agents with different pharmacokinetics in the same biological system simultaneously can reasonably be considered. Several applications of such methods in the vascular system can be considered. For example, different contrast agents injected sequentially within a single scan could allow the imaging <b>of</b> multiple <b>uptake</b> <b>phases</b> <b>of</b> a given tissue/organ [7, 32]. It could also be possible to simultaneously visualise the vascular lumen and wall in pathologies such as atherosclerosis by using a combination of specific and non-specific contrast agents [22]. These applications would considerably enhance the diagnostic capabilities and decrease the patients’ exposure to radiation. Finally, for the past 20 years, increasing efforts have been directed toward in vivo imaging of gene expression and enzyme activity, particularly in oncology research. It would be interesting to develop new multi-atom contrast agents that could be modified or cleaved in targeted tissues to allow cellular activity imaging [41 – 43].|$|R

Nitrate, phosphate and silicate concentrations decreased along the transect from 33 to 21, 2. 2 to 1. 2 and 76 to 35 mmol m− 3, respectively. Nitrite, ammonium and biogenic-silica levels increased from 0. 04 to 0. 16, 0. 01 to 2. 5 and 0. 2 to 4 mmol m− 3, respectively from south to north. Chlorophyll a concentrations increased from ∼ 0. 1 at the most southerly station to > 4. 0 mg m- 3 in the north.

Some of them are exerted within the vessel wall, so that HDL needs to pass the endothelial barrier. To elucidate their itinerary through endothelial cells (ECs), we labelled ApoA-I and HDL either fluorescently or with 1. 4 nm nanogold and investigated their cellular localization by using immunofluorescent microscopy (IFM) and electron microscopy (EM). HDL as well as ApoA-I is taken up by ECs into the same route of intracellular trafficking. Time kinetics and pulse chase experiments revealed that HDL is trafficked through different vesicles. HDL partially co-localized with LDL, albumin, and transferrin. HDL did not co-localize with clathrin and caveolin- 1. Fluorescent HDL was recovered at small proportions in early endosomes and endosome to trans-golgi network vesicles but not at all in recycling endosomes, in late endosomes or lysosomes. EM identified HDL mainly in large filled vesicles which however upon IFM did not colocalize with markers of multivesicular bodies or autophagosomes. The uptake or cellular distribution of HDL was altered upon pharmacological interference with cytochalasine D, colchicine and dynasore. Blockage <b>of</b> fluid <b>phase</b> <b>uptake</b> with Amiloride or EIPA did not reduce the <b>uptake</b> <b>of</b> HDL.

In the first paper, biweekly white spruce foliar concentrations and ratios of N, P, K, Ca, Mg and micronutrients were analyzed for 12 trees of varying mixture proportion, throughout the 2010 growing season. Results were analyzed with repeated measures design to determine patterns in foliar nutrient concentrations, including seasonal stability {{and the effect}} of mixture proportion on the timing of these relationships.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of {{rare earth elements}} (REEs) within fossil bones is controlled by their partition coefficients between apatite and pore waters, {{and the rate of}} diffusion through the bone. Using simple theoretical models, we show that REEs are strongly fractionated from one another during diffusive transport and adsorption. Fractionation occurs due to the relative ease of substituting REE ions of differing ionic radius into the Ca sites in the apatite lattice, and the degree of fractionation is dependent on the rate of diffusion of ions within bone (and therefore the rate of recrystallisation). Variations in bone thickness, recrystallisation rate, and potentially pore water composition may all influence the relative {{distribution of}} REEs, and thus REE ratios within bones. Increases in bone thickness and reductions in either diffusion coefficients or the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> REE <b>uptake</b> lead to enhanced fractionation of REEs in our model simulations.

Abstract We compare alternative drawdown strategies in retirement to a life annuity benchmark when retirees have access to government means-tested Age Pension. By adopting Epstein-Zin utility preferences which enables disentangling relative risk aversion (RRA) from elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS), our results suggest that retirees possess RRA levels which are higher than the inverse of EIS.

The <b>uptake</b> <b>of</b> Tat-peptide between 4 and 15 °C corresponds to Q 10 = 1. 1, proceeding through a prompt (< 5 min), temperature-independent process, suggesting direct membrane translocation.

Trace metals in estuarine systems frequently exist as colloid-ion complexes and the chemical characteristics of these complexes may alter their bioavailability. The relative hydrophobicity of the colloid-ion complex could influence bio-uptake across bi-lipid membranes. Penaeid shrimp are useful bioindicators because of their close trophic linkage to trace metal sinks (detritus, benthos, and sediments), and their broad geographical distributions. Radiotracers were used to compare the bioaccumulation, sites of accumulation, and deputation of colloidally-complexed and dissolved phase (free-ionic) forms of Ag, Cd, Ba, Fe, Sn, Zn, Co, Hg, and Mn in juvenile penaeid shrimp. The <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>uptake</b> experiment was 14 days, and the deputation experiment lasted 7 days. The experiments clearly demonstrated that colloidally-complexed forms of trace metals were bioavailable to shrimp. Differences in rates and extent <b>of</b> <b>uptake</b> and deputation in the colloidal and free-ionic treatments were noted for whole body and individual tissues (abdomen, carapace, and hepatopancreas). For example, colloidally-bound trace metals generally had higher concentration factors compared to free-ionic metals in the hepatopancreas after 14 days <b>of</b> <b>uptake,</b> except for Ag, Ba, and Zn. Conversely, free-ionic trace metals tended to exhibit higher concentration factors compared to colloidal metals in the abdomen and carapace, with the exceptions of Mn in the abdomen, and Co in the carapace. Concentration factors for metals in whole shrimp were generally higher for free-ionic forms compared to colloidal forms. However, statistically significant differences in overall rates and extents <b>of</b> <b>uptake</b> were not observed in these experiments. Results indicate that mass specific accumulation within the hepatopancreas far exceeded loadings within the carapace or abdomen in both treatments for all metals tested. Depuration of metals from whole body and tissues was noted for both treatment regimes, with metals introduced as free-ionic species showing greater retention in shrimp than metals introduced as colloidally-bound species. Accumulation of metals from treatment solution into the internal tissues is linked to the intake of water for respiration {{at the site of the}} gills. Metals are then internalized by active transport mechanisms mediated by specific carriers...|$|R

Spectrophotometric quantification of LY accumulation {{was performed in}} {{the presence or absence}} of transferrin, a marker of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Internalization of LY showed a curvilinear kinetics: the high initial rate of LYuptake (575 ng LY/ mg protein /hr) decreased almost 5 -fold within 15 min, reaching plateau at 126 ng/ mg protein /hr. Transferrin induced a small increase (7. 5 %) in the fluid <b>phase</b> <b>uptake</b> rate (after 5 min) followed by a small decrease at longer incubation times. Lucifer Yellow and transferrin (visualized by streptavidin– FITC) were localized in Paramecium by 3 -D reconstruction by confocal microscopy.

Phorbol ester diminished LY accumulation by 22 % and this effect persisted up to 25 min of incubation. PKC inhibitor did not affect LY uptake.

Second stage uptake was slower, pH and temperature dependent, required living bacteria, and was abolished by either dinitrophenol or N-ethyl-maleimide.

Further {{analysis of the data}} revealed that women had a significantly higher increase in stomach counts (P = 0. 022) and background-corrected stomach counts (P = 0. 018) than men. Conclusion: Women had a greater increase in gastric ⁹⁹m Tc-tetrofosmin activity than men during the radiopharmaceutical <b>uptake</b> <b>phase,</b> but there was no causal relationship between an increase in activity and olfactory stimulation from the cooking of food. 4 page(s...|$|R
30|$|OECD TG 305 {{describes}} a procedure for characterizing the bioconcentration potential of substances in fish. The test {{consists of two}} phases: the exposure (uptake) and post-exposure (depuration) <b>phases.</b> During the <b>uptake</b> <b>phase,</b> separate groups <b>of</b> fish of one species are exposed to at least two concentrations of the test substance. They are then transferred to a medium free of the test substance for the depuration phase. The concentration of the test substance in the fish is followed through both phases of the test. Where possible, the BCF is calculated preferably both as {{the ratio of the}} concentration in the fish and in the water at apparent steady state (BCFss) and as the kinetic bioconcentration factor BCFK, which is the ratio of the rate constants <b>of</b> <b>uptake</b> (k 1) and depuration (k 2) assuming first-order kinetics [2]. OECD TG 305 does not define specific analytical techniques to determine analyte concentrations in the water phase. Commonly applied are liquid-liquid extraction [LLE] and solid-phase extraction [SPE].|$|R
40|$|Folate {{transport}} in phenylhydrazine-induced rabbit reticulocytes was {{studied with}} the non-metabolized folate-analog, methotrexate. The time-course <b>of</b> methotrexate <b>uptake</b> into a mixed population of reticulocytes and mature erythrocytes is a two-component process {{consisting of a}} small, but rapid, initial <b>uptake</b> <b>phase</b> followed by a much slower uptake component which remains essentially constant over the period of observation. The velocity <b>of</b> the latter <b>uptake</b> component is directly proportional to the per cent reticulocytes and appears to represent a unidirectional influx of methotrexate into these cells. <b>Uptake</b> <b>of</b> methotrexate into reticulocytes {{was found to have}} the following characteristics: (a) temperature sensitivity, Q 10 <b>of</b> 4; (b) <b>uptake</b> velocity {{as a function of the}} extracellular methotrexate concentration approximated Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a maximum transport velocity of 48 pmoles/min per g dry wt; the extracellular methotrexate level at which the uptake velocity was one-half maximum was 1. 4 μM; (c) 5 -formyltetrahydrofolate markedly inhibited methotrexate uptake but pteroylglutamic acid inhibition was weak; (d) uptake was stimulated in cells preincubated with 5 -formyltetrahydrofolate, indicative of hetero-exchange diffusion; (e) <b>uptake</b> was independent <b>of</b> extracellular sodium but was inhibited by anions including nitrate, phosphate, and glucose- 6 -phosphate; (f) uptake was enhanced by azide plus iodoacetate...|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to phagocytosis, macropinocytosis {{is not directly}} initiated by interactions between cell surface receptors and cargo ligands, but {{is a result of}} constitutive membrane ruffling driven by dynamic remodelling of cortical actin cytoskeleton in response to stimulation of growth factor receptors. Wang et al. (2010) [13] developed a reliable assay that allows quantitative assessment of the efficiency and kinetics of macropinosome biogenesis and/or maturation in cells where the function of a targeted protein has been perturbed by pharmacological inhibitors or by knock-down or knock-out approaches. In this manuscript we describe a modified quantitative protocol to measure the rate and volume <b>of</b> fluid <b>phase</b> <b>uptake</b> in adherent cells. This assay: • uses fluorescent dextran, microscopy and semi-automated image analysis; • allows quantitation of macropinosomes within large numbers of individual cells; • can be applied also to non-homogenous cell populations including transiently transfected cell monolayers. We present the background necessary to consider when customising this protocol for application to new cell types or experimental variations...|$|R

Methods/Design A 2010 CONSORT-compliant randomised controlled trial with a two-group parallel design will assess the efficacy of a web-based PCHMS called Healthy. me in facilitating the <b>uptake</b> <b>of</b> influenza vaccine amongst university students and staff. Eligible participants are randomised either to obtain access to Healthy. me or a 6 -month waitlist. Participants complete pre-study, post-study and monthly surveys about their health and utilisation of health services. A post-study clinical audit will be conducted to validate self-reports about influenza vaccination and visits to the university health service due to influenza-like illness (ILI) amongst a subset of participants. 600 participants older than 18 years with monthly access to the Internet and email will be recruited. Participants who (i) discontinue the online registration process; (ii) report obtaining an influenza vaccination in 2010 before the commencement of the study; or (iii) report being influenced by other participants to undertake influenza vaccination will be excluded from analysis. The primary outcome measure {{is the number of}} participants obtaining influenza vaccination during the study. Secondary outcome measures include: number of participants (i) experiencing ILI symptoms, (ii) absent from or experiencing impairment in work or study due to ILI symptoms, (iii) using health services or medications due to ILI symptoms; (iv) expressing positive or negative attitudes or experiences towards influenza vaccination, via their reasons of receiving (or not receiving) influenza vaccine; and (v) their patterns of usage of Healthy. me (e. g., frequency and timing <b>of</b> hits, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> access, <b>uptake</b> <b>of</b> specific functions).

40|$|AbstractMethylammonium uptake was {{studied in}} a {{glutamine}} auxotroph of the cyanobacterium Anabaena cycadeae lacking glutamine synthetase activity. The uptake pattern {{was found to}} be biphasic, consisting of an initial fast phase lasting up to 60 s followed by a slower second phase. When cells were preincubated with L-meth-ionine-DL-sulphoximine, an irreversible inhibitor of glutamine synthetase activity, the second <b>uptake</b> <b>phase</b> was abolished although the first phase was unaffected. Since the glutamine auxotroph did not have any glutamine synthetase activity the inhibition of the second phase by L-methionine-DL-sulphoximine could not have been due to the inhibition of glutamine synthetase activity. Thus, it is suggested that the two <b>uptake</b> <b>phases</b> may represent two different ammonium transport systems, the second one being sensitive to L-meth-ionine-DL-sulphoximine...|$|R
40|$|Isolated rat livers were perfused with proprano-lol {{and other}} drugs in a {{simplified}} recirculation system without plasma proteins or erythrocytes. The propranolol levels in the reservoir declined biphasically. The first phase was rapid and al-most flow-limited despite use of high perfusion flow rates. This rapid uptake generated liver/perfusate ratios greater than 25 and was not significantly diminished by lowering the tem-perature or removing oxygen from the system. It appeared to reflect one or more physical binding processes. Autoradiography showed high concentrations of propranolol in the pen-portal zones of the liver lobule. The second, slower <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>uptake</b> was associated with metabolism of propranolol to other compounds and was temperature, oxygen and concentra-tion dependent. A number of drugs inhibited the slow phase but {{had little effect on}} the rapid <b>uptake</b> <b>phase.</b> Several <b>of</b> these drugs were able to displace small amounts of pnopnanolol from the liver. In common with several other organic amines (Anderson et at., 1974) propranolol is extracted from the plasma and concentrated by a number of organs (Black et at., 1965; Hayes and Cooper, 1971). <b>Uptake</b> <b>of</b> propranolol by liver has been extensively studied by Shand and coworker...|$|R

Furthermore the present simulation could become a possible way for estimating muscle ox-ygen uptake without previously assuming venous blood volume.
