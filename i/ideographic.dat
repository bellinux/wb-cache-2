5|$|In {{the same}} year, he {{identified}} the hieroglyphic script on the Rosetta stone as being {{written in a}} mixture of ideograms and phonetic signs, just as Young had argued for Demotic. He reasoned that if the script was entirely <b>ideographic</b> the hieroglyphic text would require as many separate signs as there were separate words in the Greek text. But there were in fact fewer, suggesting that the script mixed <b>ideographic</b> and phonetic signs. This realization finally made it possible for him to detach himself from the idea that the different scripts had to be either fully <b>ideographic</b> or fully phonetic, and he recognized it as being much more complex mixture of sign types. This realization gave him a distinct advantage.|$|E
5|$|A {{week later}} on 27 September 1822, he {{published}} {{some of his}} findings in his Lettre à M. Dacier, addressed to Bon-Joseph Dacier, secretary of the Paris Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. Champollion read the letter before the assembled Académie. All his main rivals and supporters were present at the reading, including Young {{who happened to be}} visiting Paris. This was the first meeting between the two. The presentation did not go into details regarding the script and in fact was surprisingly cautious in its suggestions. Although he must have been already certain of this, Champollion merely suggested that the script was phonetic already from the earliest available texts, which would mean that the Egyptians had developed writing independently of the other civilizations around the Mediterranean. The paper also still contained confusions regarding the relative role of <b>ideographic</b> and phonetic signs, still arguing that also hieratic and demotic were primarily <b>ideographic.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1820, Champollion {{embarked}} {{in earnest}} {{on the project}} of decipherment of hieroglyphic script, soon overshadowing the achievements of British polymath Thomas Young {{who had made the}} first advances in decipherment before 1819. In 1822, Champollion published his first breakthrough in the decipherment of the Rosetta hieroglyphs, showing that the Egyptian writing system was a combination of phonetic and <b>ideographic</b> signs – the first such script discovered. In 1824, he published a Précis in which he detailed a decipherment of the hieroglyphic script demonstrating the values of its phonetic and <b>ideographic</b> signs. In 1829 he traveled to Egypt where he was able to read many hieroglyphic texts that had never before been studied, and brought home a large body of new drawings of hieroglyphic inscriptions. Home again he was given a professorship in egyptology, but only lectured a few times before his health, ruined by the hardships of the Egyptian journey, forced him to give up teaching. He died in Paris in 1832, 41 years old. His grammar of Ancient Egyptian was published posthumously.|$|E
5|$|Although {{dismissive of}} Young's work {{even before he}} had read it, Champollion {{obtained}} {{a copy of the}} Encyclopedia article. Even though he was suffering from a failing health, and the chicanery of the Ultras kept him struggling to maintain his job, it motivated him to return in earnest {{to the study of the}} hieroglyphs. When he was eventually removed from his professorship by the Royalist faction, he finally had the time to work on it exclusively. While he awaited trial for treason, he produced a short manuscript, De l'écriture hiératique des anciens Égyptiens, in which he argued that the hieratic script was simply a modified form of hieroglyphic writing. Young had already anonymously published an argument to the same effect several years earlier in an obscure journal, but Champollion, having been cut off from academia, had probably not read it. In addition Champollion made the fatal error of claiming that the hieratic script was entirely <b>ideographic.</b> Champollion himself was never proud of this work and reportedly actively tried to suppress it by buying the copies and destroying them.|$|E
5|$|Jean-François Champollion (Champollion le jeune; 23 December 17904 March 1832) was a French scholar, philologist and orientalist, known {{primarily}} as the decipherer of Egyptian hieroglyphs and a founding {{figure in the}} field of Egyptology. A child prodigy in philology, he gave his first public paper on the decipherment of Demotic in 1806, and already as a young man held many posts of honor in scientific circles, and spoke Coptic and Arabic fluently. During the early 19th-century French culture experienced a period of 'Egyptomania', brought on by Napoleon's discoveries in Egypt during his campaign there (1797–1801) which also brought to light the trilingual Rosetta Stone. Scholars debated the age of Egyptian civilization and the function and nature of hieroglyphic script, which language if any it recorded, {{and the degree to which}} the signs were phonetic (representing speech sounds) or <b>ideographic</b> (recording semantic concepts directly). Many thought that the script was only used for sacred and ritual functions, and that as such it was unlikely to be decipherable since it was tied to esoteric and philosophical ideas, and did not record historical information. The significance of Champollion's decipherment was that he showed these assumptions to be wrong, and made it possible to begin to retrieve many kinds of information recorded by the ancient Egyptians.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} resolve issues brought by Han unification, a Unicode Technical Standard known as Unicode <b>Ideographic</b> Variation Database {{have been created}} to resolve the problem of specifying {{specific}} glyph in plain text environment..

25|$|Codepoints in Unicode Plane 3 (the Tertiary <b>Ideographic</b> Plane) {{have been}} {{tentatively}} allocated.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{boundary}} between the classes was not precise, as some <b>ideographic</b> characters were also used for their phonetic value as parts of other words.|$|E

25|$|Using {{variation}} selectors, it {{is possible}} to specify certain variant CJK ideograms within Unicode. The Adobe-Japan1 character set proposal, which actually calls for 14,679 <b>ideographic</b> variation sequences, is an extreme example of the use of variation selectors.|$|E
25|$|The major writing systems—methods of inscription—broadly {{fall into}} five categories: logographic, syllabic, alphabetic, featural, and <b>ideographic</b> (symbols for ideas). A sixth category, pictographic, is {{insufficient}} to represent language on its own, but often forms the core of logographies.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{academic}} papers published in 1884 by the Society was Some notes {{on the stage and}} its influences on the education of the masses, players and playgoers etc., by Henry Blau. Another of these papers was The <b>ideographic</b> ornamentation of Gothic buildings written in 1902 by the artist and antiquarian Thomas Tindall Wildridge. This article was informed by his book, The Grotesque in Church Art.|$|E
25|$|A dictionary, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} a wordbook, {{is a collection of}} words in one or more specific languages, often arranged alphabetically (or by radical and stroke for <b>ideographic</b> languages), which may include information on definitions, usage, etymologies, phonetics, pronunciations, translation, etc. or a book of words in one language with their equivalents in another, sometimes {{known as a}} lexicon. It is a lexicographical product which shows inter-relationships among the data.|$|E
25|$|A second {{language}} reform required the simplification of ideographs because ideographs with fewer strokes {{are easier to}} learn. In 1964 the Committee for Reforming the Chinese Written Language released an official list of 2,238 simplified characters most basic to the language. Simplification made literacy easier, although some people (especially in Hong Kong which is still using traditional Chinese) taught only in simplified characters were {{cut off from the}} wealth of Chinese literature written in traditional characters. Any idea of replacing <b>ideographic</b> script with romanized script was soon abandoned, however by government and education leaders.|$|E
25|$|The {{mainstream}} academic {{theory is}} that writing first appeared during the Sumerian civilisation in southern Mesopotamia, around 3300–3200 BC. {{in the form of}} the Cuneiform script. This first writing system did not suddenly appear out of nowhere, but gradually developed from less stylised pictographic systems that used <b>ideographic</b> and mnemonic symbols that contained meaning, but did not have the linguistic flexibility of the natural language writing system that the Sumerians first conceived. These earlier symbolic systems have been labelled as proto-writing, examples of which have been discovered in a variety of places around the world, some dating back to the 7th millennium BC.|$|E
25|$|In {{the history}} of how systems of {{representation}} of language through graphic means have evolved in different human civilizations, more complete writing systems were preceded by proto-writing, systems of <b>ideographic</b> or early mnemonic symbols. True writing, in which the content of a linguistic utterance is encoded so that another reader can reconstruct, with a fair degree of accuracy, the exact utterance written down, is a later development. It is distinguished from proto-writing, which typically avoids encoding grammatical words and affixes, {{making it more difficult}} or impossible to reconstruct the exact meaning intended by the writer unless a great deal of context is already known in advance. One of the earliest forms of written expression is cuneiform.|$|E
500|$|Book critic Scott Esposito {{pointed out}} that Chinese {{characters}} are incorrectly described as ideograms in Carr's essay, an error that he believed undermined the essay's argument. The myth that Chinese script is <b>ideographic</b> had been effectively debunked in scholar John DeFrancis' 1984 book DeFrancis classifies Chinese as a logosyllabic writing system. Carr acknowledged {{that there was a}} debate over the terminology of 'ideogram', but in a response to Esposito he explained that he had [...] "decided to use the common term" [...] and quoted The Oxford American Dictionary to demonstrate that they likewise define Chinese characters as instances of ideograms.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the popular conception of Chinese as a primarily pictographic or <b>ideographic</b> language, {{the vast majority of}} Chinese characters (about 95 percent of the characters in the Shuowen Jiezi) are constructed as either logical aggregates or, more often, phonetic complexes. In fact, some phonetic complexes were originally simple pictographs that were later augmented by the addition of a semantic root. [...] An example is 炷 zhù [...] "candle" [...] (now archaic, meaning [...] "lampwick"), which was originally a pictograph 主, a character that is now pronounced zhǔ and means [...] "host". [...] The character 火 huǒ [...] "fire" [...] was added to indicate that the meaning is fire-related.|$|E
500|$|The Egyptian hieroglyphs {{had been}} {{well known to}} {{scholars}} {{of the ancient world}} for centuries, but few had made any attempts to understand them. Many based their speculations about the script in the writings of Horapollon who considered the symbols to be <b>ideographic,</b> not representing any specific spoken language. Athanasius Kircher for example had stated that the hieroglyphs were symbols that [...] "cannot be translated by words, but expressed only by marks, characters and figures", meaning that the script was in essence impossible to ever decipher. Others considered that the use of the hieroglyphs in Egyptian society was limited to the religious sphere and that they represented esoteric concepts within a universe of religious meaning that was now lost. But Kircher had been the first to suggest that modern Coptic was a degenerate form of the language found in the Egyptian demotic script, and he had correctly suggested the phonetic value of one hieroglyph – that of mu the Coptic word for water. With the onslaught of Egyptomania in France in the early 19th century, scholars began approaching the question of the hieroglyphs with renewed interest, but still without a basic idea about whether the script was phonetic or <b>ideographic,</b> and whether the texts represented profane topics or sacred mysticism. This early work was mostly speculative, with no methodology for how to corroborate suggested readings. The first methodological advances were Joseph de Guignes' discovery that cartouches identified the names of rulers, and George Zoëga's compilation of a catalogue of hieroglyphs, and discovery that the direction of reading depended on the direction in which the glyphs were facing.|$|E
500|$|These errors {{were finally}} {{corrected}} {{later that year}} when Champollion correctly identified the hieratic script as being based on the hieroglyphic script, but used exclusively on papyrus, whereas the hieroglyphic script was used on stone, and demotic used by the people. Previously, it had been questioned whether the three scripts even represented the same language; and hieroglyphic had been considered a purely <b>ideographic</b> script, whereas hieratic and demotic were considered alphabetic. Young, in 1815, {{had been the first}} to suggest that the demotic was not alphabetic, but rather a mixture of [...] "imitations of hieroglyphics" [...] and [...] "alphabetic" [...] signs. Champollion on the other hand correctly considered the scripts to coincide almost entirely, being in essence different formal versions of the same script.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Young {{kept working}} on the Rosetta stone, and in 1819, he {{published}} a major article on [...] "Egypt" [...] in the Encyclopædia Britannica claiming that he had discovered the principle behind the script. He had correctly identified {{only a small number}} of phonetic values for glyphs, but also made some eighty approximations of correspondences between Hieroglyphic and demotic. Young had also correctly identified several logographs, and the grammatical principle of pluralization, distinguishing correctly between the singular, dual and plural forms of nouns. Young nonetheless considered the hieroglyphic, linear. or cursive hieroglyphs (which he called hieratic) and a third script which he called epistolographic or enchorial, to belong to different historical periods and to represent different evolutionary stages of the script with increasing phoneticism. He failed to distinguish between hieratic and demotic, considering them a single script. Young was also able to identify correctly the hieroglyphic form of the name of Ptolemy V, whose name had been identified by Åkerblad in the demotic script only. Nonetheless, he only assigned the correct phonetic values to some of the signs in the name, incorrectly dismissing one glyph, the one for o, as unnecessary, and assigning partially correct values to the signs for m, l, and s. He also read the name of Berenice, but here only managed to correctly identify the letter n. Young was furthermore convinced that only in the late period had some foreign names been written entirely in phonetic signs, whereas he believed that native Egyptian names and all texts from the earlier period were written in <b>ideographic</b> signs. Several scholars have suggested that Young's true contribution to Egyptology was his decipherment of the Demotic script, in which he made the first major advances, correctly identifying it as being composed of both <b>ideographic</b> and phonetic signs. Nevertheless, for some reason Young never considered that the same might be the case with the hieroglyphs.|$|E
500|$|Young did so, {{with two}} results that {{together}} {{paved the way}} for the final decipherment. In the hieroglyphic text, he discovered the phonetic characters [...] "p t o l m e s" [...] (in today's transliteration [...] "p t w l m y s") that were used to write the Greek name [...] "Ptolemaios". He also noticed that these characters resembled the equivalent ones in the Demotic script, and went on to note as many as 80 similarities between the hieroglyphic and Demotic texts on the stone, an important discovery because the two scripts were previously thought to be entirely different from one another. This led him to deduce correctly that the Demotic script was only partly phonetic, also consisting of <b>ideographic</b> characters imitated from hieroglyphs. Young's new insights were prominent in the long article [...] "Egypt" [...] that he contributed to the Encyclopædia Britannica in 1819. He could make no further progress, however.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the stone's discovery, Swedish diplomat and scholar Johan David Åkerblad was working on a little-known script of which some {{examples}} had recently been found in Egypt, which {{came to be known as}} Demotic. He called it [...] "cursive Coptic" [...] because he was convinced that it was used to record some form of the Coptic language (the direct descendant of Ancient Egyptian), although it had few similarities with the later Coptic script. French Orientalist Antoine-Isaac Silvestre de Sacy had been discussing this work with Åkerblad when he received one of the early lithographic prints of the Rosetta Stone in 1801 from Jean-Antoine Chaptal, French minister of the interior. He realised that the middle text was in this same script. He and Åkerblad set to work, both focusing on the middle text and assuming that the script was alphabetical. They attempted to identify the points where Greek names ought to occur within this unknown text, by comparing it with the Greek. In 1802, Silvestre de Sacy reported to Chaptal that he had successfully identified five names ("Alexandros", [...] "Alexandreia", [...] "Ptolemaios", [...] "Arsinoe", and Ptolemy's title [...] "Epiphanes"), while Åkerblad published an alphabet of 29 letters (more than half of which were correct) that he had identified from the Greek names in the demotic text. They could not, however, identify the remaining characters in the Demotic text, which, as is now known, included <b>ideographic</b> and other symbols alongside the phonetic ones.|$|E
