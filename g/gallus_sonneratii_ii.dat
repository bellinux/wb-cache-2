40|$|Yellow skin is an {{abundant}} phenotype among domestic chickens and {{is caused by}} a recessive allele (W*Y) that allows deposition of yellow carotenoids in the skin.

Our data imply that carotenoids are taken up from the circulation in both genotypes but are degraded by BCDO 2 in skin from animals carrying the white skin allele (W*W). Surprisingly, our results demonstrate that yellow skin does not originate from the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus), the presumed sole wild ancestor of the domestic chicken, but most likely from the closely related grey junglefowl (<b>Gallus</b> <b>sonneratii).</b> This is the first conclusive evidence for a hybrid origin of the domestic chicken, and it ha...|$|R
40|$|Current {{knowledge}} on chicken domestication is reviewed {{on the basis}} of archaeological, historical and molecular data.

Genetic diversity is now distributed among traditional populations, standardized breeds and highly selected lines. Knowing the genome sequence has accelerated the identification of causal mutations determining major morphological differences between wild Gallus and domestic breeds. Comparative genome resequencing between Gallus and domestic chickens has identified 21 selective sweeps, one involving a non-synonymous mutation in the TSHR gene, which functional consequences remain to be explored.

The results showed that the four species of the genus Gallus had great differences among each other, the G. g. domesticus was closest to the red junglefowl in Thailand and its adjacent regions, suggesting the Chinese domestic fowl probably originated from the red junglefowl in these regions. The two subspecies of Thailand, G. g. gallus and G. g. spadiceus, should belong to one subspecies because of their resemblance. In the case of native breeds, there existed a great difference between the egg breeds and general purpose breeds, which suggested different maternal origins of the two types.

40|$|With {{the aim of}} elucidating {{in greater}} detail the genealogical origin of the present {{domestic}} fowls of the world, we have determined mtDNA sequences of the D-loop regions {{for a total of}} 21 birds, of which 12 samples belong to red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) comprising three subspecies (six Gallus gallus gallus, three Gallus gallus spadiceus, and three Gallus gallus bankiva) and nine represent diverse domestic breeds (Gallus gallus domesticus). We also sequenced four green junglefowl (Gallus varius), two Lafayette's junglefowl (Gallus lafayettei), and one grey junglefowl (<b>Gallus</b> <b>sonneratii).</b> We then constructed a phylogenetic tree for these birds by the use of nucleotide sequences, choosing the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) as an outgroup. We found that a continental population of G. g. gallus was the real matriarchic origin of all the domestic poultries examined in this study. It is also of particular interest that there were no discernible differences among G. gallus subspecies; G. g. bankiva was a notable exception. This was because G. g. spadiceus and a continental population of G. g. gallus formed a single cluster in the phylogenetic tree. G. g. bankiva, on the other hand, was a distinct entity, thus deserving its subspecies status. It implies that a continental population of G. g. gallus sufficed as the monophyletic ancestor of all domestic breeds.

40|$|Domestic {{animals have}} been {{selected}} by humans for thousands of years, which have drastically altered their genetic constitution and phenotypes. In this thesis, several {{of the most important}} genes causing pigmentation differences between the wild red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) and domestic chickens have been identified. Pigmentation phenotypes are easily scored, and the genes underlying these phenotypes are valuable models to study gene function and gene interaction. Dominant white colour is widespread among domestic chickens. The Dominant white allele specifically inhibits the expression of black (eumelanin) pigment and we identified several insertion/deletion mutations in the PMEL 17 gene causing the different phenotypes controlled by this locus. The Silver allele on the other hand inhibits the expression of red (pheomelanin) colour and is a genetic variant of the SLC 45 A 2 gene. Silver is the first pheomelanin-specific mutation(s) reported for this gene. An 8 kb deletion, including a conserved enhancer element, 14 kb upstream of the transcription factor SOX 10 is causing the Dark brown phenotype. This phenotype restricts the expression of eumelanin and enhances red pheomelanin in specific parts of the plumage. These three gene identifications have extended the knowledge about genes affecting melanocyte function. Carotenoid-based pigmentation is of utmost importance in birds and other animals. The yellow skin allele in chicken allows deposition of carotenoids in skin and explains why most domestic chickens have yellow legs. We demonstrated that the yellow skin phenotype is caused by a tissue specific regulatory mutation in the gene for the enzyme beta-caroten dioxygenase 2 (BCDO 2). This was the first identification of a specific gene underlying carotenoid-based pigmentation. Interestingly, the yellow skin haplotype was shown to originate from the grey junglefowl (<b>Gallus</b> <b>sonneratii)</b> and not the red junglefowl as expected, thus presenting the first conclusive evidence for a hybrid origin of the domestic chicken. ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{parents of}} all our domesticated animals were of course aboriginally wild in disposition; and when a domesticated species is crossed with a {{distinct}} species, {{whether this is a}} domesticated or only a tamed animal, the hybrids are often wild to such a degree, that the fact is intelligible only on the principle that the cross has caused a partial return to a primitive disposition. Thus, the Earl of Powis formerly imported some thoroughly domesticated humped cattle from India, and crossed them with English breeds, which belong to a distinct species; and his agent remarked to me, without any question having been asked, how oddly wild the cross-bred animals were. The European wild boar and the Chinese domesticated pig are almost certainly specifically distinct: Sir F. Darwin crossed a sow of the latter breed with a wild Alpine boar which had become extremely tame, but the young, though having half-domesticated blood in their veins, were [...] "extremely wild in confinement, and would not eat swill like common English pigs." [...] Captain Hutton, in India, crossed a tame goat with a wild one from the Himalaya, and he remarked to me how surprisingly wild the offspring were. Mr. Hewitt, who has had great experience in crossing tame cock-pheasants with fowls belonging to five breeds, gives as the character of all [...] "extraordinary wildness" [...] (13/42. 'The Poultry Book' by Tegetmeier 1866 pages 165, 167.); but I have myself seen one exception to this rule. Mr. S. J. Salter (13/43. 'Natural History Review' 1863 April page 277.) who raised a large number of hybrids from a bantam-hen by <b>Gallus</b> <b>sonneratii,</b> states that [...] "all were exceedingly wild." [...] Mr. Waterton (13/44. 'Essays on Natural History' page 917.) bred some wild ducks from eggs hatched under a common duck, and the young were allowed to cross freely both amongst themselves and with the tame ducks; they were [...] "half wild and half tame; they came to the windows to be fed, but still they had a wariness about them quite remarkable." ...|$|R
40|$|A major {{challenge}} in the post-genomic era is to understand how genome sequence variants (genotype) give rise to the enormous diversity observed in terms of morphology, physiology and behavior (phenotype) among living organisms. Domestic animals—with their tremendous phenotypic variation—are excellent model organisms for determining the relationships between genotype and phenotype. In this thesis, I describe the utilization of the chicken, in combination with modern genetic and genomic approaches, in developing {{our understanding of the}} genetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic variation. These studies provide novel information on the genetics behind variation in carotenoid- and melanin-based pigmentation—observed in many organisms—and also cast light on the genetic basis of chicken domestication. In paper I, we report that the yellow skin phenotype—observed in most commercial chickens—is caused by one or several tissue-specific mutations altering the expression of beta-carotene oxygenase 2 (BCO 2 or BCDO 2) in skin. In addition, we present the first conclusive evidence of a hybrid origin of the domestic chicken, since the allele causing yellow skin most likely originates from the grey jungle fowl (<b>Gallus</b> <b>sonneratii)</b> and not from the previously described sole ancestor, the red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus). In paper II, we detect a number of loci that were likely important during the domestication process of chicken and the later specialization into meat (broiler) and egg (layer) producing lines. One of the major findings was that worldwide, almost all domestic chickens carry a missense mutation in TSHR (thyroid stimulating hormone receptor) in a position that is completely conserved amongst vertebrates. We speculate that this “domestication-mutation” has {{played an important role in}} the transformation of the wild red jungle fowl ancestor into the modern domestic chicken. In paper III, we demonstrate that the dilution of red (pheomelanin) pigmentation—observed in the plumage of the Inhibitor of Gold chicken—is caused by a frame-shift mutation in the catechol-O-methyltransferase domain containing 1 (COMTD 1) gene. The production and regulation of pheomelanin is poorly understood and this discovery advances our current knowledge of this pathway...|$|R
60|$|As {{the goose}} has proved so little {{flexible}} in its organisation under long- continued domestication, {{the amount of}} variation which it has undergone may be worth giving. It has increased in size and in productiveness (8/25. L. Lloyd 'Scandinavian Adventures' 1854 volume 2 page 413, says that the wild goose lays from five to eight eggs, which is a much fewer number than that laid by our domestic goose.); and varies from white to a dusky colour. Several observers (8/26. The Rev. L. Jenyns (Blomefield) seems first to have made this observation in his 'British Animals.' See also Yarrell, and Dixon in his 'Ornamental Poultry' (page 139), and 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1857 page 45.) have stated that the gander is more frequently white than the goose, and that when old it almost invariably becomes white; {{but this is not}} the case with the parent-form, the A. ferus. Here, again, the law of analogous variation may have come into play, as the almost snow-white male of the Rock goose (Bernicla antarctica) standing on the sea-shore by his dusky partner is a sight well known to those who have traversed the sounds of Tierra del Fuego and the Falkland Islands. Some geese have top-knots; and the skull beneath, as before stated, is perforated. A sub-breed has lately been formed with the feathers reversed at the back of the head and neck. (8/27. Mr. Bartlet exhibited the head and neck of a bird thus characterised before the Zoological Soc. February 1860.) The beak varies a little in size, and is of a yellower tint than in the wild species; but its colour and that of the legs are both slightly variable. (8/28. W. Thompson 'Natural Hist. of Ireland' 1851 volume 3 page 31. The Rev. E.S. Dixon gave me some information on the varying colour of the beak and legs.) This latter fact deserves attention, because the colour of the legs and beak is highly serviceable in discriminating the several closely allied wild forms. (8/29. Mr. A. Strickland in 'Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' 3rd series volume 3 1859 page 122.) At our Shows two breeds are exhibited; viz., the Embden and Toulouse; but they differ in nothing except colour. (8/30. 'Poultry Chronicle' volume 1 1854 page 498; volume 3 page 210.) Recently a smaller and singular variety has been imported from Sebastopol (8/31. 'The Cottage Gardener' September 4, 1860 page 348.), with the scapular feathers (as I hear from Mr. Tegetmeier, who sent me specimens) greatly elongated, curled, and even spirally twisted. The margins of these feathers are rendered plumose by the divergence of the barbs and barbules, so that they resemble in some degree those on the back of the black Australian swan. These feathers are likewise remarkable from the central shaft, which is excessively thin and transparent, being split into fine filaments, which, after running for a space free, sometimes coalesce again. It is a curious fact that these filaments are regularly clothed on each side with fine down or barbules, precisely like those on the proper barbs of the feather. This structure of the feathers is transmitted to half-bred birds. In <b>Gallus</b> <b>sonneratii</b> the barbs and barbules blend together, and form thin horny plates of the same nature with the shaft: in this variety of the goose, the shaft divides into filaments which acquire barbules, and thus resemble true barbs.|$|R
