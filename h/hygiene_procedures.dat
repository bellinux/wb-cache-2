Simple <b>hygiene</b> <b>procedures</b> involving the disposal of rubbish and excrement were required, but were neglected {{in the early stages}} of the campaign. Lieutenant Colonel Edward Ford arranged for supplies of a new drug, sulphaguanidine, to be shipped from Australia. The widespread use of a scarce drug was a gamble, as it used up all the stocks in Australia, but one that paid off; it arrested the epidemic, and allowed sick men to travel, thereby saving lives. When the Australians advanced on Kokoda in October, special details constructed latrines, buried the dead, and, in extreme cases, burned villages that the Japanese had fouled beyond redemption.|$|E

In response to the need for effective codes of hygiene in home and everyday life settings the International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene has developed a risk-based approach based on Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP), which {{has come to be known}} as [...] "targeted hygiene".

A total of 14, 119 semen cultures were performed, showing an annual increase of 45 % from the start to the end of the study. The proportion of positive semen cultures was stable throughout the study period (40 to 45 %). Many bacterial species were considered as contaminants (coagulase-negative staphylococci, alpha-hemolytic streptococci). For pathogen agents (in most cases, Enterobacteriaceae), the antibiotic resistance profile revealed mostly a susceptible phenotype.

40|$|Effective {{cleaning}} and sanitizing of food preparation sites {{is important because}} pathogens are readily spread to food contact surfaces after preparation of contaminated raw products. Tolerance of Salmonella Enteritidis and Staphylococcus aureus to surface cleaning by wiping with regular, microfiber, and antibacterial-treated cloths was investigated. Wiping with cleaning cloths resulted in a considerable reduction of microorganisms from surfaces, despite the greater difficulty in removing S. aureus than Salmonella Enteritidis. Depending on the cloth type, S. aureus were reduced on surfaces from initial numbers of approximately 105 CFU/ 100 cm 2 to numbers from less than 4 CFU/ 100 cm 2 (below the detection limit) to 100 CFU/ 100 cm 2. Directly after the cloths were used to clean the contaminated surfaces, they contained high numbers of bacteria (104 to 105 CFU/ 100 cm 2), except for the disposable antibacterial-treated cloths, in which no bacteria could be detected. The tolerance of these pathogens to sodium hypochlorite was studied in the suspension test and in cloths. S. aureus showed a better tolerance for sodium hypochlorite than Salmonella Enteritidis. Inactivation of microorganisms in cloths required a higher concentration of sodium hypochlorite than was needed in the suspension test. Repeated exposure to sodium hypochlorite, however, resulted {{in an increase in}} susceptibility to this compound. This study provides essential information about the transfer of bacteria when wiping surfaces and highlights the need for a <b>hygiene</b> <b>procedure</b> with cleaning cloths that sufficiently avoids cross-contamination in the household environment...|$|R

40|$|Background: Fixed {{orthodontic}} appliances {{may interfere with}} daily oral <b>hygiene</b> <b>procedure,</b> causing more abundant plaque accumulation, therefore increasing the risk of periodontal disease. Probiotic methods represent a breakthrough approach in maintaining oral health and preventing periodontal disease. Purpose: The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the effect between probiotic lozenges containing Lactobacillus reuteri and probiotic drinks containing Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota towards periodontal status of orthodontic patients. Method: Fixed orthodontic patients (n= 30) from Faculty of Dentistry, Trisakti University Dental Hospital were included in this clinical trial. Periodontal status consisting of Plaque Index (PlI), Interdental Hygiene Index (HYG), and Papillary Bleeding Index (PBI) were then recorded from each patient. All patients received the phase one of periodontal treatment, as well as plaque control instruction. The subjects (n= 10 /gp) were randomly assigned to one of three groups; control group; probiotic lozenges group (Biogaia®); and probiotic drinks group (Yakult®). For 14 days, the probiotic groups were instructed to use the probiotic. Periodontal index improvement (PlI, HYG, and PBI) was found in all groups after 14 days research periode. These indices were then analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis analysis test. Result: It was found that L. reuteri and L. casei strain Shirota may improve periodontal status in fixed orthodontic patients. The best results were obtained from probiotic lozenges group. However, the results were not statistically significant (p> 0. 05). Conclusion: It was concluded that probiotics consumption containing L. reuteri and L. casei strain Shirota may slightly improve periodontal status in fixed orthodontic patients...|$|R
