25|$|When {{partition}} was announced, {{the newly}} created line divided the Sikh population into two halves. The Sikhs suffered organized violence and riots against them in West Pakistan, and Sikhs moved en masse to the Indian side leaving behind their property and the sacred places of Sikhism. This reprisals on Sikhs were not one sided, because as Sikhs entered the Indian side, the Muslims in East Punjab experienced reprisals and they moved to West Pakistan. Before the partition, Sikhs constituted about 15% {{of the population in}} West Punjab that became a part of Pakistan, the majority being Muslims (55%). The Sikhs were the economic elite and wealthiest in West Punjab, with them having the largest representation in West Punjab's aristocracy, nearly 700 Gurdwaras and 400 educational institutions that served the interests of the Sikhs. Prior to the partition, there were a series of disputes between the majority Muslims and minority Sikhs, such as on the matters of jhatka versus <b>halal</b> <b>meat,</b> the disputed ownership of Gurdwara Sahidganj in Lahore which Muslims sought as a mosque and Sikhs as a Gurdwara, and the insistence of the provincial Muslim government in switching from Indian Gurmukhi script to Arabic-Persian Nastaliq script in schools. During and after the Simla Conference in June 1945, headed by Lord Wavell, the Sikh leaders initially expressed their desire to be recognized as the third party, but ultimately relegated their demands and sought a United India where Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims would live together, under a Swiss style constitution. The Muslim League rejected this approach, demanding that entire Punjab should be granted to Pakistan. The Sikh leaders then sought the partition instead, and Congress Working Committee passed a resolution in support of partitioning Punjab and Bengal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this work}} was the {{comparison}} between the carcass and the meat ewes of the regional Traditional market and the Islamic religious (Halal) market. Methods Thirty and 20 {{at the end of}} career traditional market and Halal market ewes were slaughtered following the EC (European Council, 2009) animal welfare guidelines. Live weight of ewes was taken and dressing percentage of carcasses was calculated. On every carcass zoometric measurement and the evaluation trough the EU grid rules were performed. On the Musculus longissimus thoracis of 12 Traditional market carcasses and 11 Halal market carcasses the physical-chemical and nutritional analysis were performed. Consumer tests for liking meat ewe were performed in order to find consumer’s preference level for Traditional and <b>Halal</b> markets ewe <b>meat.</b> Considering as fixed factor the ewe meat market (Traditional and Halal), results were submitted to oneway Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and to Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Results The Halal market ewes have shown lower dressing percentages (42. 91 [*]±[*] 0. 82 vs 46. 42 [*]±[*] 0. 69) and lower conformation score (4. 5 [*]±[*] 0. 5 vs 7. 8 [*]±[*] 0. 4). The <b>Halal</b> market <b>meat</b> showed higher cooking loss in oven (37. 83 [*]±[*] 1. 20 vs 32. 03 [*]±[*] 1. 15  %), lesser Chroma value (18. 63 [*]±[*] 0. 70 vs 21. 84 [*]±[*] 0. 67), and lesser Hue angle value (0. 26 [*]±[*] 0. 02 vs 0. 34 [*]±[*] 0. 02). This product had also lower fat percentage (4. 2 [*]±[*] 0. 4 vs 7. 09 [*]±[*] 0. 4). The traditional market meat had higher percentage in monounsatured fatty acids (MUFA) (43. 84 [*]±[*] 1. 05 vs 38. 22 [*]±[*] 1. 10), while the <b>Halal</b> market <b>meat</b> had higher percentage in ω 3 poliunsatured fatty acids (PUFA) (5. 04 [*]±[*] 0. 42 vs 3. 60 [*]±[*] 0. 40). The consumer test showed as the ewe meat was appreciate by the consumers. Conclusions Both meat typologies have shown good nutritional characteristics. The traditional market meat had higher MUFA composition, and a better MUFA/satured fatty acids (SFA) ratio, while the <b>Halal</b> market <b>meat</b> had higher PUFA composition. These results were also supported by the PCA. The consumers preferred the traditional market meat...|$|R

This thesis examines and discusses {{the issues in}} this demanding field with respect to Indonesia and Malaysia as target markets. No previous research in this specific area has been performed. The methodology used to conduct this research is qualitative. Locally resident Indonesian and Muslim consumers of Halal food were invited to focus group meetings.

The study discovered that the South East Asian Muslim consumers are seeking animal based protein in their food rather than plant based protein. Food sourcing from Halal animals and methods are a given criteria in Indonesia and Malaysia. New Zealand has been showing good trading relationships with these markets and has gone extra miles to prove the integrity of Halal processes in the industry. The study’s results brief that there is a great demand for <b>Halal</b> sheep <b>meat</b> and beef products in Indonesia and Malaysia. New Zealand is capable of meeting this demand. However, there are areas {{that need to be addressed}} to improve the profitability to New Zealand exporters, food producers and food manufacturers.
