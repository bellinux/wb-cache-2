For example, part of President Clinton’s statement upon signing the Agricultural Risk Protection Act (ARPA) of 2000 was as follows: “I have heard many farmers say that the crop insurance program was simply not a good value for them, providing too little coverage for too much money. My FY 2001 budget proposal and this bill directly address that problem by making higher insurance coverage more affordable, which should also mitigate the need for ad hoc crop loss disaster assistance such as we have seen for the last three years. ” In 2006 testimony before the House Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies, <b>former</b> <b>USDA</b> under-secretary J.

40|$|A {{system to}} {{calculate}} genetic evaluations {{based on an}} animal model was developed for final score (single-trait model) and 15 linear type traits (multitrait model) of Ayrshires, Brown Swiss, Guernseys, Jerseys, and Milking Shorthorns. (Co) variance components were estimated from appraisals that were scored during 1988 and later and that included all linear traits. The model for (co) variance components included fixed effects for interactions of herd, appraisal date, and parity; parity and appraisal age; and parity and lactation stage. Random effects were included for permanent environment, animal, and residual. A canonical transformation was used with approximate diagonalization. Data for estimating breeding values included appraisals from 1980. Effects for appraisal age and lactation stage were defined within appraisal year group. The model for calculation of breeding values also included a random effect of interaction between herd and sire. Solutions for appraisal age from a preliminary analysis were smoothed with a quadratic curve to generate additive age adjustments by month for appraisal age, parity, and appraisal year group. Correlations of solutions from this model and from the <b>former</b> <b>USDA</b> sire model for bulls that were born during 1975 or later and that had 20 daughters were highest (generally 0. 90) for Guernseys and were lowest (generally < 0. 80) for Milking Shorthorns. The evaluation system was implemented in February 1998 and was extended to Red and Whites. Peer reviewe...|$|R

After all, an {{opportunity}} to speak to a large assembly of one’s colleagues does not come along everyday. I struggled with answering a fundamental question: what can I speak about that my peers will find interesting and useful? Previous presidential addresses have covered a variety of topics ranging from improving SAEA membership to providing insights into how our profession may address important issues of the day. Past presidents have sought to answer some difficult questions. Has our profession lost its relevance? Have we drifted too far from our agricultural roots? Is our profession {{headed in the right direction}} (Harris, 2000; Hudson, 2011; Segarra, 1998) ? Others have offered insights on issues central to our mission such as advances in teaching methods (Broder, 1994), improved curriculums (Reed, 2010), and effectiveness of Extension programs (Doye, 2006). Some have provided commentary on changes in trade and agricultural policies and their effects on agriculture and rural communities of the south (Duffy, 1997; Marchant, 1999).

40|$|Range cattle provide {{room and}} board for a large variety of flatworm and {{roundworm}} parasites. A parasite is by definition an agent that inflicts a degree of harm to a host, and the damage caused depends on the innate abilities, size of the population, duration of infection and other factors tied to the parasite. Host-related factors are also important, including breed, age, sex and condition. The damage to animals may be obvious, with clinical signs including diarrhea, loss of weight, “bottle jaw” (swelling under the jaw), rough hair coat, reproductive/breeding dysfunction and, in severe cases, feed waste due to an inability to digest protein, depressed lactation in cows and diminished immune response to viral, bacterial and mycotic opportunists. The roundworms known as trichostrongylids are widely known {{to be the most}} common and economically important group of worms in cattle in the world (ARS, NRP # 20420, <b>USDA</b> 1976). <b>Members</b> of the group inhabit the abomasum (Ostertagia species, Trichostronglus axei and Haemonchus species), small intestine (Cooperia species, Nematodirus species and Trichostrongylus colubriformis) and the lungs (Dictyocaulus species). They range from about the size of an eyelash to more than an inch in length and damage the lining of the organ they inhabit by burrowing through cell layers or feeding on blood or tissues. Although liver fluke or lungworm can be a significant problem in local areas, the magnitude of importance warrants focus on the abomasal/intestinal trichostrongylids, especially Ostertagia ostertagi the medium stomach worm...|$|R

40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). Selecting the most {{sustainable}} biomass crop type for biofuel production is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem involving various conflicting criteria. In this paper, we propose a unique stochastic analytical hierarchy process (AHP) that can handle uncertain information and identify weights of criteria in the MCDM problem. By utilizing the beta distribution and approximating its median, we convert various types of expert evaluations including imprecise values into crisp values. We ensure consistency in each evaluation matrix before aggregating expert judgments. We then demonstrate use of the model by applying it to sustainable biomass crop selection. In order to define a comprehensive list of the selection criteria, we utilize the existing literature and opinions of experts including farmers, government specialists from the U. S. Department of Agriculture (<b>USDA),</b> and faculty <b>members</b> {{in the areas of}} biomass and bioenergy. The evaluation model includes three main sustainability criteria defined as economic, environmental, and social aspects associated with a total of 16 sub-criteria. We apply the proposed model to biomass alternatives including switchgrass, Miscanthus, sugarcane, corn, and wheat in Kansas. Results show the weights of economic, environmental, and social aspects to be 0. 59, 0. 26, and 0. 15, respectively. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the score of switchgrass increases if environmental criteria are emphasized. On the other hand, wheat and corn become more favorable than other alternatives if priority is given to economic factors. The most sustainable biomass sources in different regions can be determined by applying the presented selection hierarchy. The proposed stochastic AHP methodology can also be utilized for other complex multi-criteria decision-making problems with uncertain information and multiple stakeholders.
