5|$|In P. fimbriata from Queensland and <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> species, {{contests}} {{between males}} usually last only 5 to 10seconds, and only their legs make contact. Contests between Portia females are usually long and violent, and in P. fimbriata from Queensland these often including grappling that sometimes breaks a leg. A victor may evict a loser, and then eat the loser's eggs {{and take over}} the loser's web. Unlike <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> Portia species, victorious females of P. fimbriata from Queensland do not kill and eat the losers.|$|E

5|$|Maple syrup {{has been}} {{produced}} {{on a small}} scale <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> countries, notably Japan and South Korea. However, in South Korea in particular, it is traditional to consume maple sap, called gorosoe, instead of processing it into syrup.|$|E
5|$|While the {{perianth}} may point forwards, in {{some species}} such as N. cyclamineus it is folded back (reflexed, see illustration, left), while <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> {{species such as}} N. bulbocodium (Table I), it is reduced to a few barely visible pointed segments with a prominent corona.|$|E
5|$|A version called High Five Netball is {{promoted}} by the All England Netball Association. It is aimed at 9- to 11-year-old girls and includes only five positions. The players swap positions during the game. When a player {{is not on the}} court, she is expected to help the game <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> way, such as being the timekeeper or scorekeeper. High Five Netball has four six-minute quarters.|$|E
30|$|In the literature, such {{mappings}} {{are called}} {{in two different}} ways: (c)-comparison functions <b>in</b> <b>some</b> sources (see, e.g., [11]), and Bianchini-Grandolfi gauge functions <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>others</b> (see, e.g., [12 – 14]).|$|R

5|$|Although {{the concept}} of chakra appears in the Indian mythology {{as well as in}} Buddhism and <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> belief systems, when asked in an interview, Kishimoto claimed that none of these {{influences}} were the basis for his use of the concept in Naruto. He further asserted that it was a term to apply a concrete definition to the ninjas' ability to use jutsu in the series and is comparable to the Force in Star Wars or to magic points in role-playing games.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{infestation}} by this aphid, leaves of sugar beet become swollen, roll, and cease developing. The roots grow poorly and the sugar content is reduced. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> plants the leaves do not become distorted but growth is affected and flowers abort due to {{the action of the}} toxic saliva injected by the aphid to improve the flow of sap.|$|E
5|$|As {{usual in}} oryzomyines, 12 ribs are present. The first rib articulates {{with both the}} last {{cervical}} (neck) and first thoracic (chest) vertebrae, a synapomorphy of the Sigmodontinae. The anapophyses, processes {{at the back of}} vertebrae, are absent from the fifth lumbar. Between the second and third caudal vertebrae, hemal arches (small bones) are present with a spinous back border. The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> rodents, this foramen perforates the distal end of the humerus.|$|E

5|$|Cerebral edema, if {{associated}} with coma, often necessitates admission to intensive care, artificial ventilation, and close observation. The administration of fluids is slowed. The ideal treatment of cerebral edema in DKA is not established, but intravenous mannitol and hypertonic saline (3%) are used—as <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> forms of cerebral edema—in {{an attempt to}} reduce the swelling.|$|E
5|$|Dogmeat is a {{recurring}} dog non-player character (NPC) in the Fallout series of post-apocalyptic themed role-playing video games. Dogmeat was introduced as an optional companion to the player {{character in the}} original Fallout (1997), and has made cameo appearances in the sequel Fallout 2 (1998) and <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> video games. Another, different Dogmeat is featured in the same role in Fallout 3 (2008) and Fallout 4 (2015). In both incarnations of the character, Dogmeat was well received, becoming widely {{regarded as one of}} the best remembered features in the series, as well as one of the most popular sidekick type characters in video gaming overall.|$|E
5|$|Favourable {{macroeconomic}} {{performance has}} been a necessary but not sufficient condition for the significant reduction of poverty amongst the Indian population. The rate of poverty decline has not been higher in the post-reform period (since 1991). The improvements <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> non-economic dimensions of social development have been even less favourable. The most pronounced example is an exceptionally high and persistent level of child malnutrition (46% in 2005–6).|$|E
50|$|Labour battalions {{have been}} a form of {{alternative}} service or unfree labour in various countries in lieu of or resembling regular military service. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> cases they {{were the result of}} some kind of discriminative segregation of the population, while <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>others</b> they {{have been a}} conscious choice.|$|R
2500|$|The Sanskrit term [...] as {{a common}} noun means [...] "knowledge". The term <b>in</b> <b>some</b> contexts, such as hymn 10.93.11 of the Rigveda, means [...] "obtaining or finding wealth, property", while <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>others</b> it means [...] "a bunch of grass together" [...] as in a broom or for ritual fire.|$|R

5|$|Florida State's {{traditional}} {{rivals in}} all sports include the University of Florida Gators, the University of Miami Hurricanes and the University of Virginia Cavaliers with {{a battle for}} the Jefferson-Eppes Trophy. The Jefferson-Eppes Trophy is exchanged between the University of Virginia and Florida State University after each football competition {{in recognition of the}} common roots shared by the two schools. Rivalries <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> sports also exist, including the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets in baseball and the Duke University Blue Devils in basketball.|$|E
5|$|Galveston's {{attitudes toward}} race were at times {{unique in the}} region. The strict segregationalist attitudes {{prevalent}} {{in many parts of}} the U.S. were not always as stark in Galveston's society as <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> parts of Texas. One of the most striking examples of this was the gradual establishment of biracial labor unions of waterfront workers beginning in the 19th century, although eventually this alliance fell victim to segregationist influence. Racist ideology was always an ever-present factor in the city, however, as evinced by the name of the group which ran the Mardi Gras, the Kotton Karnival Kids (KKK, the same initials as the Ku Klux Klan).|$|E
5|$|In most circumstances, {{in order}} to become law a bill must be first passed by both houses of the Diet and then {{promulgate}}d by the Emperor. This role of the Emperor is similar to the Royal Assent <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> nations; however, the Emperor cannot refuse to promulgate a law and therefore his legislative role is merely a formality.|$|E
50|$|The {{definition}} of a rural settlement depends on the country. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> countries, a rural settlement is any settlement in the areas defined as rural by a governmental office, e.g., by the national census bureau. This may include even rural towns. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>others,</b> rural settlements traditionally do not include towns.|$|R

30|$|The {{above-mentioned}} {{tools are}} used to assess environmental or social impacts of scenarios. However the different scenarios or plans {{may be difficult to}} compare to each <b>other</b> as <b>some</b> scenarios might prove to be better <b>in</b> <b>some</b> aspects but worse <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>others.</b> <b>In</b> <b>some</b> cases it may therefore be useful to further aggregate the results.|$|R
5|$|It {{is likely}} that the tonal {{lowering}} seen in this particular example is related to the low tone nasal prefix found in future tense constructions <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> Senufo languages. In fact, Supyire shows a similar phenomenon in future tense constructions with a direct object (in other future tense constructions, a low tone nasal is found).|$|E
5|$|Methods on {{objects are}} {{functions}} {{attached to the}} object's class; the syntax instance.method(argument) is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for Class.method(instance, argument). Python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, {{in contrast to the}} implicit self (or this) <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> object-oriented programming languages (e.g., C++, Java, Objective-C, or Ruby).|$|E
5|$|Other {{less common}} {{conditions}} which {{appear in the}} breed include hydroxyglutaric aciduria, which is where elevated levels of Alpha-Hydroxyglutaric acid are in the dog's urine, blood plasma, and spinal fluid. It can cause seizures, muscle stiffness, and ataxia, but is more commonly found in Staffordshire Bull Terriers. A degeneration of the hip joint, known as Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, also occurs in the breed. However, the chances of this condition occurring are much higher <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> breeds, such as the Australian Shepherd and the Miniature Pincher. The breed {{is also one of}} the least likely to be affected by a luxating patella, where the knee cap slips out of place.|$|E
