5|$|The family Bovidae {{is placed}} in the order Artiodactyla (which {{includes}} the even-toed ungulates). It includes 143 extant species, accounting for nearly 55% of the ungulates, and 300 known <b>extinct</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Mascarene grey parakeet or Thirioux’s {{grey parrot}} (Psittacula bensoni), is an <b>extinct</b> <b>species</b> of parrot which was endemic to the Mascarene islands of Mauritius and Réunion {{in the western}} Indian Ocean. It has been {{classified}} {{as a member of}} the tribe Psittaculini, along with other parrots from the islands.|$|E
5|$|There are a {{total of}} 142 species {{recorded}} from the island of Vieques. Some species, such as the Puerto Rican parrot, have been extirpated from the island but are, nonetheless, included in this list. <b>Extinct</b> <b>species</b> {{are not included in}} this list.|$|E

5|$|It {{is evident}} that the mandibles were highly specialized. Like other Cretaceous ants, Zigrasimecia {{provides}} further evidence that the extinct ant fauna exhibited a great diversity of feeding behavior. The unusual mouthparts of Zigrasimecia are consistent with other <b>extinct</b> <b>species</b> found in Burmese, French, New Jersey and Canadian deposits, which also show morphologies not seen in extant ants.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{vary greatly}} in size. They include the {{smallest}} primates {{in the world}} and, until recently, also included some of the largest. They currently {{range in size from}} about 30g (1.1oz) for Madame Berthe's mouse lemur (Microcebus berthae) up to 7–9kg (15–20lb) for the indri (Indri indri) and diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema). When recently <b>extinct</b> <b>species</b> are considered, the size range extended up to that of a gorilla at 160–200kg (350–440lb) for Archaeoindris fontoynonti.|$|E
5|$|Puerto Rico's turtle fauna {{includes}} both freshwater (5 species, including two <b>extinct</b> <b>species)</b> and marine turtles (5). Two of these species, the hawksbill turtle and the leatherback sea turtle, are critically endangered. Threats to these species include habitat destruction and illegal capture of eggs and individuals. The spectacled caiman, an introduced species, {{is the only}} representative of the order Crocodilia in Puerto Rico.|$|E

5|$|The Bovidae are the {{biological}} family of cloven-hoofed, ruminant mammals that includes bison, African buffalo, water buffalo, antelopes, sheep, goats, muskoxen, and domestic cattle. A {{member of this}} family is called a bovid. With 143 extant species and 300 known <b>extinct</b> <b>species,</b> the family Bovidae consists of eight major subfamilies apart from the disputed Peleinae and Pantholopinae. The family evolved 20 million years ago, in the early Miocene.|$|E
5|$|The Choiseul pigeon (Microgoura meeki) is an <b>extinct</b> <b>species</b> of bird in {{the pigeon}} and dove family, Columbidae. It was endemic to the island of Choiseul in the Solomon Islands, {{although}} there are unsubstantiated reports that it may once have lived on several nearby islands. The last confirmed sighting was in 1904. Other common names were Solomons crested pigeon, Solomon Islands crowned-pigeon and Kuvojo.|$|E
5|$|The Mascarene parrot or Mascarin (Mascarinus mascarin) is an <b>extinct</b> <b>species</b> of parrot {{that was}} endemic to the Mascarene island of Réunion {{in the western}} Indian Ocean. The taxonomic {{relationships}} of this species {{have been subject to}} debate; it has historically been grouped with either the Psittaculini parrots or the vasa parrots, with the latest genetic study favouring the former group.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} of bull trout and other native {{species of fish}} in Banff's lakes has also dwindled, {{with the introduction of}} non-native species including brook trout, and rainbow trout. Lake trout, westslope cutthroat trout, and Chiselmouth are rare native species, while chinook salmon, White sturgeon, Pacific lamprey, and Banff longnose dace are likely extirpated locally. The Banff longnose dace, once only found in Banff, is now an <b>extinct</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{woolly mammoth}} (Mammuthus primigenius) is an <b>extinct</b> <b>species</b> of mammoth that lived during the Pleistocene epoch, {{and was one}} of the last in a line of mammoth species, {{beginning}} with Mammuthus subplanifrons in the early Pliocene. The woolly mammoth diverged from the steppe mammoth about 400,000 years ago in East Asia. Its closest extant relative is the Asian elephant. The appearance and behaviour of this species are among the best studied of any prehistoric animal because of the discovery of frozen carcasses in Siberia and Alaska, as well as skeletons, teeth, stomach contents, dung, and depiction from life in prehistoric cave paintings. Mammoth remains had long been known in Asia before they became known to Europeans in the 17th century. The origin of these remains was long a matter of debate, and often explained as being remains of legendary creatures. The mammoth was identified as an <b>extinct</b> <b>species</b> of elephant by Georges Cuvier in 1796.|$|E
5|$|There {{are a few}} Pleistocene (2.6million to 12,000years BP) {{records from}} Europe of extant Regulus species, mostly goldcrests or unidentifiable to species. The only fossil of an extinct Regulus is a left ulna from 2.6–1.95mya in Bulgaria, which was {{identified}} as belonging to an <b>extinct</b> <b>species,</b> Regulus bulgaricus. The goldcrest lineage diverged from this apparent ancestor of the common firecrest in the Middle Pleistocene.|$|E

5|$|While {{many species}} of pigeons and doves have benefited from human {{activities}} and have increased their ranges, many other species have declined in numbers and some have become threatened or even succumbed to extinction. Among the ten species to have become extinct since 1600 (the conventional date for estimating modern extinctions) {{are two of the}} most famous <b>extinct</b> <b>species,</b> the dodo and the passenger pigeon.|$|E
5|$|Based on genome sequencing, the Tapanuli {{orangutan}} {{separated from}} other orangutans about 700,000 years ago, {{and the two}} other species diverged about 400,000 years ago. The orangutans are the only surviving species of the subfamily Ponginae, which also included several other species, such as the three <b>extinct</b> <b>species</b> of the genus Gigantopithecus, including the largest known primate Gigantopithecus blacki. The ancestors of the Ponginae subfamily split from the main ape line in Africa 16 to 19 million years ago (mya) and spread into Asia.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{molecular}} clock estimation, Trigonognathus {{is thought to}} have originated around 41 million years ago during the Middle Eocene, {{as part of a larger}} evolutionary radiation of etmopterid genera. The genus is represented in this time period by the <b>extinct</b> <b>species</b> T. virginiae, whose fossilized teeth have been recovered from Lutetian age (47.8–41.3 Mya) strata in Landes, southwestern France. Fossil teeth virtually identical to those of the modern viper dogfish are known from the Cubagua Formation in northeastern Venezuela, which dates to the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene (11.6–3.6 Mya).|$|E

5|$|In 1892, the Scottish naturalist Henry Ogg Forbes {{described}} Hawkins's rail, an <b>extinct</b> <b>species</b> of rail {{from the}} Chatham Islands, {{as a new}} species of Aphanapteryx; A. hawkinsi. He found the Chatham Islands species more similar to the red rail than the latter was to the Rodrigues rail, and proposed that the Mascarene Islands had once been connected with the Chatham Islands. These ideas were later criticised by writers such as the British palaeontologist Charles William Andrews and the German ornithologist Hans Friedrich Gadow, and the bird was moved to its own genus, Diaphorapteryx.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, another rodent {{from the}} same group was described: Noronhomys, a {{recently}} <b>extinct</b> <b>species</b> from the Brazilian island of Fernando de Noronha. Michael Carleton and Storrs Olson, who described the animal, argued that Holochilus primigenus was probably outside the clade of Noronhomys and extant Holochilus and that H.primigenus should probably be excluded from the genus. When Ulyses Pardiñas described another extinct rodent from this group, Carletonomys from the Pleistocene of Argentina, he suggested that H. primigenus should be placed in its own genus because of its mosaic of Holochilus- and Lundomys-like features.|$|E
5|$|Newton's parakeet (Psittacula exsul), {{also known}} as the Rodrigues parakeet or Rodrigues ring-necked parakeet, is an <b>extinct</b> <b>species</b> of parrot that was endemic to the Mascarene island of Rodrigues in the western Indian Ocean. Several of its {{features}} diverged from related species, indicating long-term isolation on Rodrigues and subsequent adaptation. The rose-ringed parakeet of the same genus is a close relative and probable ancestor. Newton's parakeet may itself have been ancestral to the endemic parakeets of nearby Mauritius and Réunion.|$|E
