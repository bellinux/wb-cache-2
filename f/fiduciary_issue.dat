The SVU is also cheerfully accepted in the Beyond (though some communities use other exchange media, one instance being Dar Sai). The currency is generally presented {{in the form of}} notes, with coins being used for fractional units. Bank drafts are widely used for large amounts. The paper notes are validated by means of a widely available device known as a [...] "fake-meter"; in The Killing Machine, Kirth Gersen intercepts a communication that allows him to deduce how the validation process works, and hence how to counterfeit currency. (Before printing the currency lines are lightly scored on the paper causing areas of greater density. The position and alignment of these areas is used to validate the notes.) ...|$|E

Then it changes the rules of the system so that they comply with the rules of Bitcoin&# 8217;s protocol.

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a new perspective}} on the links between British imperialism and metropolitan finance by showing how formal power reinforced ‘money power’ at a formative stage in the political development of the colony of Queensland. In 1866, despite the contraction of the bridgeheads of formal British authority in eastern Australia, local imperial representatives quickly aligned with private interests when British investments appeared to be threatened by a proposal to introduce a <b>fiduciary</b> note <b>issue.</b> Subsequently, Queensland politicians continued to contest the control of money and the scope of government intervention in the colonial economy. Ultimately, however, the inflow of British capital created new bridgeheads of British power in Queensland, re-constituting it as a ‘colonial place’ in the informal empire of investment and influence.

40|$|Re{{insurance}} is {{insurance that}} {{an insurance company}} purchases from another insurance company. The original insurance company is called the reinsured, and the insurance company that is contracted is called the reinsurer. The main purpose of reinsurance is to disperse or spread the risk of loss. The reinsurance relationship is frequently characterized as an exercise of fiduciary responsibility based upon an undertaking of utmost good faith between contracting parties. However, disputes arise; most litigation involving reinsurance has been between reinsurers and persons not party to the reinsurance agreement. This paper’s first major area of discussion {{is the relationship between}} the reinsurer and the reinsured. In particular this paper will focus on whether the duty of disclosure in the reinsurance context rises to a <b>fiduciary</b> duty, <b>issues</b> concerning reinsurers’ involvement in the defense of claims, and the liability of the reinsurer to reimburse ceding companies for losses resulting from the ceding company’s failure to perform contractual obligations. This paper’s second major area of analysis concerns reinsurance-related issues stemming from the insolvency of insurers. Finally, this paper discusses the insolvency dilemma that the insurance industry has recently encountered and examines possible options available to reinsurers and the reinsured in their efforts to stabilize practices in the reinsurance business...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} Corporate Governance is {{shifting}} from {{the role of}} directors to active ownership. Based on their fiduciary duty to other shareholders, {{it is believed that}} institutional investors have an important role to play in this regard. However, the Pension Funds and the Sovereign Wealth Organisations are not driven by the same set of objectives. In addition, Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) issues in investment decision-making are now becoming more important and they are capable of becoming the mainstream in the future. However, there are widespread variations in perception of <b>fiduciary</b> responsibilities, ESG <b>issues</b> appraisal, as well as the strategies adopted by institutional investors on shareholder engagement as responsible investors. Responsible Investment market is largely driven by institutional investors and they are expected to continue to lead the way. This research work investigates the role of the main asset owners and their advisors in responsible investment practices in the UK. It adopts a qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews, questionnaire and meetings observations. Gathered data is analysed using grounded theory and the findings highlight the perception of the various investor groups to corporate governance. The research work contributes to the body of knowledge by assessing the corporate governance perspectives of the various classes of institutional investors which may have practical implications for other countries...|$|R
40|$|Next Term, in Jones v. Harris, the Supreme Court will {{be called}} upon to resolve {{philosophical}} divergences on a massive, critical, yet academically slighted subject: the dysfunctional system through which almost one hundred million Americans attempt to save more than ten trillion dollars for their retirement. When this case was in the Seventh Circuit, two of the foremost theorists of law and economics, Chief Judge Frank Easterbrook and Judge Richard Posner, disagreed vociferously on competing analyses of the investment industry. The Supreme Court’s ruling will not only resolve the intricate <b>fiduciary</b> and doctrinal <b>issues</b> of this dispute but also have profound implications upon several major theoretical debates in contemporary American jurisprudence: the clash of classical versus behavioral economics; the judicial capacity to evaluate increasingly sophisticated econometric analyses of financial systems; and the determination of the legal constraints - if any - upon executive compensation decisions. In this Article, I advance a positive account of the economic and legal context of this dispute and then argue normatively for a behavioral approach to its resolution. Because of the unique structure and history of the personal investment industry in the United States, the architecture of this segment of the economy is singularly bereft of beneficial market forces and thus vulnerable to significant fiduciary distortions. The ultimate judicial resolution of this dispute should take full account of the behavioral constraints upon individual investors and their advisors to avoid nullifying a federal statute and to impose discipline in a vital segment of the U. S. economy...|$|R
