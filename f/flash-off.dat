40|$|The {{motor vehicle}} {{retailing}} and services industry {{is one of}} the largest service industries in the developed world. A persistent issue concerning consumers, motor vehicle insurers, and smash repairers alike is how much a smash repairer should be paid for the paint labour time. While attempts are being made to replace the old system known in the smash repairs industry as 'funny time, funny money' by fairer systems based on empirical evidence, there is lack of rigorous analysis based on observed data and sound statistical methods. This paper proposes and calibrates a statistical model for estimating paint labour times, accounting for the inherently significant uncertainties in the paint process. Fine details such as <b>flash-off</b> time, the number of paint layers, and the number of coats per layer are included in the model. A series of experiments were conducted at various paint workshops over a few years to collect data for model calibration. It was found that, excluding drying time, paint labour times obey a simple relationship to the panel areas. A case study was performed to compare the model predicted upper bounds with an empirically developed commercial system of paint labour times. 10 page(s...|$|E
40|$|A gas chromatographic method with a {{capillary}} column and a programmed temperature vaporizer injector {{has been used}} to analyze the individual free fatty acids in cheese. The lipids were extracted from an acidified cheese slurry with diethyl ether and treated with tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) to convert the free fatty acids to tetramethylammonium soaps (TMA-soaps), which were subsequently pyrolyzed to methyl esters in the injector. Carrying out injection at the initial column temperature resulted in lower dispersion of the results, but the solvent front prevented quantitative determination of butyric and caproic acids, and an injector temperature of 300 °C was therefore employed. Under the conditions tested, trimethylamine (tma) <b>flash-off</b> did not affect the determinations. The accuracy of the method improved at higher free fatty acid contents (coefficient of variation of 0. 53 % for a total free fatty acid content of 9000 mg/kg as opposed to 7. 0 % for a total free fatty acid. content of 1400 mg/kg). The recovery rate for individual free fatty acids ranged between 91 and 103 %.

40|$|The liquid {{carried by}} the {{combined}} drain system mainly contains water, heavy liquid hydrocarbons and mixed light end hydrocarbon gas (VOC) /Acid Gas (e. g. H 2 S mixture). The liquid was routed to a small horizontal pressure vessel to <b>flash-off</b> trapped gas and carryover oil is skimmed in an open sump downstream of the vessel. Increased flow rate to the close drain flash system has decreased the retention time and thus results in adequate flashing of lighter hydrocarbons and acid gas from the closed drain influent coming into the old vessel. This has created a potential environment and safety hazard for the people working around that vessel when the flashing of residual hydrocarbon and acid gas occurs in the sump, which is open to atmosphere. The mitigation of the problem involved designing a large horizontal tank with a heating coil and oil separation chamber, which can provide adequate retention time for the VOC/acid gas to flash off from the influent liquid. The oil chamber will collect hydrocarbon-oil after the de-emulsification process. Mechanical agitation, by using the desanding nozzle, prevents accumulation of sand {{at the bottom of}} the vessel. The project aims at the prevention of the carryover oil with outlet water into the biological process reactor downstream of the new tank. The accumulated oil is analyzed. The oil sample contains species similar to light crude oil. Economic analysis is performed to estimate the revenue obtained from the disposal of spent oil to a third party carrier...|$|E
40|$|Solvent-borne {{thermally}} cured coil-coating resins contain {{large amounts}} of volatile organic solvents {{in order to obtain}} suitable flow for film application. This work describes how the expensive and environmental hazardous volatile organic solvent content of a solvent-borne thermally cured polyester/melamine coil-coating system can be reduced by introduction of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) as reactive diluents and modification of the polyester binder resin. The evaluated reactive diluents, two rape seed methyl esters (RMEs), two linseed oil methyl esters (LMEs), and a tall oil methyl ester (TOME) have been evaluated both in a fully formulated clear-coat system and via model studies. Viscosity measurements of wet paint mixtures showed that formulations with hyperbranched polyester binder hold lower viscosity than conventional polyester binder resins and that FAME works as a diluent. Fully formulated clear-coats were cured under simulated industrial coil-coating cure conditions and in a convection oven at lower temperatures respectively. FAME increases the mobility of the system enhancing the film formation process. Free-standing clear-coat films were analyzed with Raman, carbon- 14 dating, extraction, dynamic mechanical analysis, and visual observation. Incorporation of FAME could not be confirmed by Raman analysis. However, carbon- 14 dating indicated the presence of FAME that could not be extracted from the films. The mechanical properties of the films were also affected by the addition of FAMEs, oven temperature, choice of co-solvent, and <b>flash-off</b> period. Conventional film characterization tests on substrate supported coatings indicated that binder resin structure and cure conditions affect the final film properties. Model studies were performed to clarify how FAME can chemically react through transesterification with the hydroxyl-groups of the polyester. The transesterification reaction between different FAMEs and primary alcohols with and without tertiary hydrogen was monitored with 1 H-NMR and real time IR. Evaporation and side reactions, e. g. alkene reactions, are competing factors to the transesterification reaction. The study showed that fatty acid structure, reaction time, and temperature affect the transesterification conversion, degree of side reactions, and choice of catalyst. A pigmented fully formulated polyester/melamine formulation with a reactive diluent was cured at full scale in an industrial coil-coating production facility. Evaluation of the final film properties showed that the coating fulfills the specification of conventional polyester/melamine coil-coating systems. QC 2010081...|$|E
40|$|This work {{describes}} how a fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) {{derived from a}} vegetable oil can be introduced as reactive diluent in a solvent-borne thermally cured coil-coating system. The evaluated reactive diluent, rape seed methyl ester (RME), has been evaluated both in a fully formulated clear coat system and via model studies. A reactive diluent {{is a compound that}} acts as a solvent in the liquid paint, lowering the viscosity, and chemically reacts into the final film during cure. Introduction of a reactive diluent derived from vegetable oil give a more environmental compliant coating since a renewable material is incorporated in the coating and the amount of traditional solvent can be decreased. These positive environmental factors have increased the industrial interest. The fully formulated clear coat studies {{describes how}} addition of reactive diluent affects rheological properties of the wet paint, film formation, incorporation, and final film properties in a hydroxyl-functional polyester/melamine coil-coating system. The coating were cured under industrial coil-coating cure conditions and analyzed with Raman, carbon- 14 dating, extraction, dynamic mechanical analysis, and visually observed. Viscosity measurement of the wet paint show that RME works as a diluent. RME increase the mobility in the system enhancing the film formation process and occurrence of defect-free films. The incorporation of RME could not be confirmed by Raman analysis. However, carbon- 14 dating did indicate the presence of RME that could not be extracted from the films. The appearance and mechanical properties of the films were also significantly affected by addition of RME. Dynamic mechanical analysis of the free standing films showed that the final film properties were affected by oven temperature, choice of co-solvent, and <b>flash-off</b> period. Model studies were performed to further clarify how RME chemically can react through transesterification with the hydroxyl-groups of the polyester. RME and its two main components methyl oleate and methyl linoleate were reacted with primary alcohols with and without tertiary hydrogen both under low temperature (110, 130, 150, 170 °C) and industrial cure conditions. The transesterification reaction was monitored with 1 H-NMR and real time IR. Evaporation and side reactions, e. g. oxidation, are competing factors with the transesterification reaction. The fatty acid structure affects the conversion as a higher amount of unsaturations triggers higher degree of oxidation. The study also showed that reaction time and temperature affects the transesterification conversion, degree of side reactions, and catalyst choice. QC 2010111...|$|E
