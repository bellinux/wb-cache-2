25|$|After the war Beith {{continued}} to write novels, {{but they did}} not achieve the great popularity of his earlier books. He became interested in the theatre, and wrote a succession of plays, several of which had notably long runs. The Times remarked that as a playwright Ian Hay was a name to conjure with. Between the First and Second World Wars, Beith had eight plays produced of which he was the sole author, and a further eleven written in collaboration with others. His co-authors were Anthony Armstrong, Guy Bolton, Seymour Hicks, Stephen King-Hall, A E W Mason, Edgar Wallace and P. G. Wodehouse. His longest running plays in the inter-war years were Tilly of Bloomsbury (1919; 414 performances), <b>Good</b> <b>Luck</b> (<b>with</b> Seymour Hicks, 1923; 262 performances), The Sport of Kings (1924; 319 performances) and Housemaster (1936; 662 performances).|$|E

2500|$|On August 23, {{the album}} was {{announced}} for release on October 8, 2013. A few days prior to the release, the band {{won the right to}} self-release the album, with the band contractually obligated to owing Victory at least two more albums. McKinnon said about Victory, [...] "The only thing [...] held above us was the right to put out this album and we won the right to put it out ourselves [...] Now it can go to a jury and good luck having a jury of random people agree that two live albums that are sold separately not count as an album, <b>good</b> <b>luck</b> <b>with</b> that." [...] The band self-released the album digitally on October 8. A physical edition with additional tracks was released on November 25, by the band's own label, ADTR Records.|$|E
2500|$|The Persian king Ardesher advised his lawyers, secretaries, officers, and husbandmen to [...] "marry near {{relatives}} for {{the sympathy}} of kinship is kept alive thereby." [...] The same motivation {{is given in}} ancient Arabic sources referring {{to the practice of}} marriage between paternal cousins prevalent in pre-Islamic Arabia. The Kitab al-Aghani similarly features the story of Qays ibn Dharih, who was not allowed by his father to marry a beautiful maiden from another tribe because, {{in the words of the}} father felt that as rich and wealthy man he did not want his son to take the side of a stranger. There is the related consideration that a man who grows up with a cousin in the intimate setting of one extended family knows her and so may develop his own liking or love for her. There is also the benefit of knowing the qualities of the spouse: a Syrian proverb reads, [...] "Ill luck which you know is better than <b>good</b> <b>luck</b> <b>with</b> which you get acquainted." [...] Keeping property in the family is a final reason for cousin marriage. One of the earliest examples of this is the five daughters of Zelophehad from ancient Israel (...) who upon inheriting from their father all married their father's brother's sons. The Quranic law dictating that daughters receive a portion of the inheritance appears to have had the effect of increasing cousin marriage rate.|$|E
