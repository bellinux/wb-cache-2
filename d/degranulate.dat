40|$|Objective: To {{detect and}} {{quantify}} mast cells in peritoneal, ovarian, and deep infiltrating endometriosis and {{to study the}} relationship between mast cells and nerves in endometriosis. Design: Prospective histological and immunohistochemical study. Setting: University of Brussels, Belgium. Patient(s) : Sixty-nine women undergoing laparoscopic excision of endometriosis for pain. Thirty-seven biopsies of normal tissue were obtained from women without endometriosis. Intervention(s) : Excision of endometriosis from different anatomical locations. Main Outcome Measure(s) : Immunohistochemistry with chymase and tryptase to confirm the presence of mast cells and activated mast cells, respectively, in endometriotic lesions. Quantification of mast cells, activated mast cells, and <b>degranulating</b> mast cells in the different locations of endometriosis. Study {{of the relationship between}} mast cells and nerves by quantifying mast cells located less than 25 μm from nerves immunohistochemically stained with S- 100 protein. Preoperative pain score evaluation by visual analogue scales. Result(s) : Patients with deeply infiltrating lesions had significantly higher preoperative pain scores than patients with peritoneal or ovarian endometriosis. Mast cells and <b>degranulating</b> mast cells are significantly more abundant in endometriotic lesions than in nonaffected tissues. Deep infiltrating lesions show a significantly higher number of mast cells, activated mast cells, and mast cells located < 25 μm from nerves than peritoneal and ovarian lesions. We found significantly more <b>degranulating</b> mast cells in deep infiltrating lesions than in peritoneal lesions. Conclusion(s) : The presence of increased activated and <b>degranulating</b> mast cells in deeply infiltrating endometriosis, which are the most painful lesions, and the close histological relationship between mast cells and nerves strongly suggest that mast cells could {{contribute to the development of}} pain and hyperalgesia in endometriosis, possibly by a direct effect on nerve structures. © 2006 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

50|$|The {{classification}} of NSAIDs can be disputed. Aspirin, for example, causes the mast cells to <b>degranulate,</b> releasing histamines and causing symptoms to flare.

40|$|<b>Degranulating</b> eosinophils {{have been}} {{described}} in most endometrial cancers. We hypothesized that endometriosis (ectopic, nonneoplastic endometrial tissue) would be an appropriate model system for determining whether eosinophil degranulation {{is part of a}} specific immune response to endometrial cancer or if it is related to the more general phenomenon of tissue remodeling (wound healing) that is common to both disorders. To test this hypothesis, we performed immunohistochemistry and Western blotting to evaluate the presence of eosinophil peroxidase (a marker of eosinophil degranulation) in normal endometrium (n = 20) and endometriosis samples (n = 24) and to define the coexpression of three eosinophil chemoattractants: interleukin- 5 (IL- 5), eotaxin, and regulated on activator-normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES). There was focally intense deposition of eosinophil peroxidase in the fibrotic connective tissue and blood vessels of 21 of 24 human endometriosis specimens; two samples showed weak staining, and only one tissue was negative for eosinophil degranulation. None of the 10 normal proliferative endometrial specimens had evidence of eosinophil degranulation, and four of 10 secretory tissues stained only weakly for eosinophil peroxidase. The presence of <b>degranulating</b> eosinophils was also associated with the presence of eotaxin and IL- 5 in some samples and with RANTES in others. We conclude that the abundant presence of <b>degranulating</b> eosinophils in the fibrous regions of endometriosis supports the interpretation that eosinophils are involved in general tissue remodeling and wound healing rather than a tissue-directed immune response...|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} pathophysiologic mechanism of mast cell and basophil histamine release is immunologic. These cells, if sensitized by IgE antibodies {{attached to their}} membranes, <b>degranulate</b> when exposed to the appropriate antigen.

Antibiotics like polymyxin are also found to stimulate histamine release.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cytotoxic {{eosinophil}} granule proteins {{are considered}} {{important in the}} pathogenesis of inflammatory airway diseases, including asthma, rhinitis, and polyposis. However, {{little is known about}} the mechanisms involved in the deposition of these tissue-damaging granular products in vivo. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the occurrence of <b>degranulating</b> eosinophils, those with morphologic evidence of cytolysis with associated clusters of free eosinophil granules (Cfegs), and to identify the frequency of apoptotic eosinophils in inflamed upper airway tissue. METHODS: Eosinophil-rich nasal polyps were processed for transmission electron microscopy and for light microscopic evaluation of whole-mount preparations subjected to deep tissue staining for eosinophil peroxidase. RESULTS: The mean proportion of eosinophil subtypes were intact and resting (6. 8 %), intact but <b>degranulating</b> (83 %), cytolytic or Cfegs (9. 9 %), and apoptotic (0. 0 %). All <b>degranulating</b> eosinophils exhibited piecemeal degranulation. The occurrence of Cfegs was confirmed in nonsectioned whole-mount preparations. Depending on the appearance of their core and matrix, the specific granules were divided into four subtypes, and a degranulation index (altered per total granules) was calculated for each eosinophil. Cytolytic eosinophils had a much lower degranulation index than intact eosinophils present in the same tissue (P <. 001). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that eosinophil cytolysis is present in human airway mucosa, that its occurrence is not an artifact of the means of tissue handling, and that cytolysis of eosinophils may occur without prior extensive degranulation. We suggest that eosinophil cytolysis is a major activation mechanism, which occurs along with, but is distinct from, other types of degranulation...|$|R

50|$|Eosinophil granulocytes {{appear in}} large numbers in {{inflammation}} sites {{and in response to}} certain parasitic infections. These cytoplasmic granulocytes contain positively charged proteins that characterize the cells. ECP is one of the four highly basic proteins that enter the surrounding tissues when activated eosinophils <b>degranulate.</b> Although circulating ECP levels can vary widely among patients, some studies show that serum ECP measurements are useful in monitoring many active inflammatory diseases. ECP concentrations in plasma and other body fluids increase during inflammatory reactions marked by activated eosinophils.|$|E
50|$|In the {{gastrointestinal}} tract, mucosal {{mast cells}} {{are located in}} close proximity to sensory nerve fibres, which communicate bidirectionally. When these mast cells initially <b>degranulate,</b> they release mediators (e.g., histamine, tryptase, and serotonin) which activate, sensitize, and upregulate membrane expression of nociceptors (i.e., TRPV1) on visceral afferent neurons via their receptors (respectively, HRH1, HRH2, HRH3, PAR2, 5-HT3); in turn, neurogenic inflammation, visceral hypersensitivity, and intestinal dysmotility (i.e., impaired peristalsis) result. Neuronal activation induces neuropeptide (substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) signaling to mast cells where they bind to their associated receptors and trigger degranulation of a distinct set of mediators (β-Hexosaminidase, cytokines, chemokines, PGD2, leukotrienes, and eoxins).|$|E
50|$|Eosinophils are {{specialized}} {{white blood}} cells of the granulocytic cell line which contain granules in their cytoplasm. These granules contain proteins that are toxic to parasites. When these granules <b>degranulate,</b> or break down, chemicals are released that combat parasites such as A. cantonensis. Eosinophils, which are located throughout the body, are guided to sites of inflammation by chemokines when the body is infested with parasites such as A. cantonensis. Once {{at the site of}} inflammation, Type 2 cytokines are released from helper T cells, which communicate with the eosinophils, signaling them to activate. Once activated, eosinophils can begin the process of degranulation, releasing their toxic proteins in the fight against the foreign parasite.|$|E

5000|$|Mast cells play a {{key role}} in the {{inflammatory}} process. When activated, a mast cell can either selectively release (piecemeal degranulation) or rapidly release (anaphylactic degranulation) [...] "mediators", or compounds that induce inflammation, from storage granules into the local microenvironment. Mast cells can be stimulated to <b>degranulate</b> by allergens through cross-linking with immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptors (e.g., FcεRI), physical injury through pattern recognition receptors for damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), microbial pathogens through pattern recognition receptors for pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and various compounds through their associated G-protein coupled receptors (e.g., morphine through opioid receptors) or ligand-gated ion channels. Complement proteins can activate membrane receptors on mast cells to exert various functions as well.|$|E
50|$|Basophils arise {{and mature}} in bone marrow. When activated, basophils <b>degranulate</b> to release histamine, {{proteoglycans}} (e.g. heparin and chondroitin), and proteolytic enzymes (e.g. elastase and lysophospholipase). They also secrete lipid mediators like leukotrienes (LTD-4), and several cytokines. Histamine and proteoglycans are pre-stored in the cell's granules {{while the other}} secreted substances are newly generated. Each of these substances contributes to inflammation. Recent evidence suggests that basophils are {{an important source of}} the cytokine, interleukin-4, perhaps more important than T cells.

50|$|An {{allergic}} reaction, formally {{known as}} type 1 hypersensitivity, {{is the result}} of an inappropriate immune response triggering inflammation, vasodilation, and nerve irritation. A common example is hay fever, which is caused by a hypersensitive response by mast cells to allergens. Pre-sensitised mast cells respond by <b>degranulating,</b> releasing vasoactive chemicals such as histamine. These chemicals propagate an excessive inflammatory response characterised by blood vessel dilation, production of pro-inflammatory molecules, cytokine release, and recruitment of leukocytes. Severe inflammatory response may mature into a systemic response known as anaphylaxis.|$|R
50|$|Eosinophils {{also have}} {{kidney-shaped}} lobed nuclei (two to four lobes). The number of granules in an eosinophil can vary {{because they have}} a tendency to <b>degranulate</b> while in the blood stream. Eosinophils play a crucial part in the killing of parasites (e.g., enteric nematodes) because their granules contain a unique, toxic basic protein and cationic protein (e.g., cathepsin); receptors that bind to IgE are used to help with this task. These cells also have a limited ability to participate in phagocytosis, they are professional antigen-presenting cells, they regulate other immune cell functions (e.g., CD4+ T cell, dendritic cell, B cell, mast cell, neutrophil, and basophil functions), they are involved in the destruction of tumor cells, and they promote the repair of damaged tissue. A polypeptide called interleukin-5 interacts with eosinophils and causes them to grow and differentiate; this polypeptide is produced by basophils.|$|E
50|$|The {{inflammation}} {{is caused}} by viruses, bacteria, irritants or allergens. The most common kind of rhinitis is allergic rhinitis, which is usually triggered by airborne allergens such as pollen and dander. Allergic rhinitis may cause additional symptoms, such as sneezing and nasal itching, coughing, headache, fatigue, malaise, and cognitive impairment. The allergens may also affect the eyes, causing watery, reddened, or itchy eyes and puffiness around the eyes. The inflammation results in the generation of large amounts of mucus, commonly producing a runny nose, {{as well as a}} stuffy nose and post-nasal drip. In the case of allergic rhinitis, the inflammation {{is caused by}} the degranulation of mast cells in the nose. When mast cells <b>degranulate,</b> they release histamine and other chemicals, starting an inflammatory process that can cause symptoms outside the nose, such as fatigue and malaise. In the case of infectious rhinitis, it may occasionally lead to pneumonia, either viral or bacterial. Sneezing also occurs in infectious rhinitis to expel bacteria and viruses from the respiratory system.|$|E
5000|$|The late {{phase of}} a Type 1 {{reaction}} (which develops 8-12 hours and is mediated by mast cells) {{should not be confused}} with delayed hypersensitivity Type IV allergic reaction (which takes 48-72 hours to develop and is mediated by T cells). [...] The products of the early phase reaction include chemokines and molecules that act on endothelial cells and cause them to express Intercellular adhesion molecule (such as vascular cell adhesion molecule and selectins), which together result in the recruitment and activation of leukocytes from the blood into the site of the allergic reaction. [...] Typically, the infiltrating cells observed in allergic reactions contain a high proportion of lymphocytes, and especially, of eosinophils. The recruited eosinophils will <b>degranulate</b> releasing a number of cytotoxic molecules (including Major Basic Protein and eosinophil peroxidase) as well as produce a number of cytokines such as IL-5. [...] The recruited T-cells are typically of the Th2 variety and the cytokines they produce lead to further recruitment of mast cells and eosinophils, and in plasma cell isotype switching to IgE which will bind to the mast cell FcεRI receptors and prime the individual for further allergic responses.|$|E
40|$|Many filarial nematodes, {{including}} Onchocerca volvulus (the {{cause of}} human 'River Blindness'), have a mutually dependent relationship with Wolbachia bacteria. There {{has been much}} interest in Wolbachia as a chemotherapeutic target, {{since there are no}} macrofilaricidal drugs (i. e., lethal to adult worms) of low toxicity. Using the bovine parasite O. ochengi, we previously demonstrated that combined intensive and intermittent (COM) oxytetracycline treatment induces a sustained depletion of Wolbachia and is macrofilaricidal, whereas a short intensive regimen (SIR) is non-macrofilaricidal. To understand how targeting Wolbachia with oxytetracycline can lead to worm death, O. ochengi nodules (onchocercomata) were sequentially excised from cattle administered COM or SIR therapy, and cell infiltrates were microscopically quantified. Pre-treatment, worms were surrounded by neutrophils, with eosinophils rare or absent. At 8 - 12 weeks after either regimen, eosinophils increased around worms and were observed <b>degranulating</b> on the cuticle. However, with the SIR treatment, neutrophils returned to predominance by 48 weeks, while in the COM group, eosinophilia persisted. These observations suggest that accumulation of <b>degranulating</b> eosinophils over a prolonged period is a cause rather than an effect of parasite death, and the macrofilaricidal mechanism of antibiotics may relate to facilitation of eosinophil infiltration around worms by ablation of Wolbachia-mediated neutrophilia.

40|$|SummaryEpithelial {{damage is}} {{commonly}} found in airways of asthma patients.

Bronchial biopsies obtained from patients with allergic asthma (n= 11), non-allergic asthma (n= 7), and healthy controls (n= 5) were studied by transmission electron microscopy. Epithelial damage was found to be extensive in both asthma groups. Both in basal and in columnar cells, relative desmosome length was reduced by 30 – 40 %. In columnar cells, half-desmosomes (i. e., desmosomes of which only one side was present) were frequently noticed.
