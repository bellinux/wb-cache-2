40|$|Focusing {{attention}} {{is a way}} for animals to search for and to obtain food efficiently. This study examines whether a sit-and-wait forager, the orb-web spider Cyclosa octotuberculata, focuses its attention on limited foraging areas. Video records of foraging activity revealed that the spiders detected prey trapped in the west and east sectors of their web less frequently than prey trapped in the north and south sectors. Comparison of photos of the web <b>hub</b> area <b>with</b> and <b>without</b> spiders present revealed that the spiders pulled radii towards the centre when waiting for prey. Radius pulling is stronger in the north and south web sectors than in the west and east sectors, possibly causing more tension in radii running vertically. Experimental manipulation indicated that the spiders responded to prey quicker when thread tension was increased. The results suggest that C. octotuberculata focus their attention on the web areas above and below the spider by adjusting the tension in web threads; and this causes higher prey detection rates in these areas...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this Master thesis is an {{in-depth}} research study {{on a specific}} type of network systems known as hub-and-spoke networks. In particular, we study q-Hub Arc Location Problems that consist, at a strategical level, of selecting q hub arcs and at most p hub nodes, and of the routing of commodities through the so called hub level network. We propose strong formulations to two variants of the problem, namely the q-hub arc location problem and the q-hub arc location problem <b>with</b> isolated <b>hub</b> nodes. We present a Lagrangian relaxation that exploits the structure of these problems by decomposing them into |K|+ 2 independent easy-to-solve subproblems and develop Lagrangian heuristics that yield high quality feasible solutions to both models. We, further, provide some insights on the structure of the optimal solutions to both models and investigate the cost benefit of incomplete <b>hub</b> networks <b>with</b> and <b>without</b> isolated <b>hub</b> nodes. Finally, computational results on a set of benchmark instances with up to 100 nodes are reported to assess the performance of the proposed MIP formulations and of our algorithmic approach...|$|R
