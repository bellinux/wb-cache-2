40|$|Introduction Modeling of <b>geologic</b> <b>structures</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} rule towards a better understanding and deciphering many problems {{in the field of}} the subsurface structures. Geological mapping of subsurface structures formed through various successive events can be conducted through logical modeling of these events in relation to the geologic units and surfaces. In the present work, we extended an algorithm for logical modeling of <b>geologic</b> <b>structures</b> formed through a sequence of sedimentation and erosion to be used in modeling of the faulted <b>geologic</b> <b>structures</b> [1]. In our approach, we defined the fault as a plane dividing a three-dimensional geologic unit and the open space into two blocks, with the <b>geologic</b> <b>structures</b> formed through sedimentation and erosion saved in each block [2]. With such an extended logical model, faulted <b>geologic</b> <b>structures</b> can be analyzed in space and time in an easy way of computer processing including estimation of surfaces and 3 -D visualization of the ge...|$|R

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{influence}} of mountain-scale thermal property model variations on predicted host-rock thermal response, a series of heat conduction calculations were run using a representative two-dimensional cross section of Yucca Mountain. The effects of modeled <b>geologic</b> <b>structure</b> were evaluated through comparisons of results from a single-material, homogeneous model with those from a uniformly layered model, a discontinuous sloping-layered model, and a geo-statistical realization of thermal properties. Comparisons indicate that assumed <b>geologic</b> <b>structure</b> can result in up to a 24 {degrees}C difference in predicted temperature response. Further, thermal simulations of the method used to analyze geostatistical realizations of thermal properties shows promise as an efficient means of capturing <b>geologic</b> <b>structure</b> without the complexities of intricate finite element meshing. The functional representation of two thermal property models were also investigated. The first examines the effect of using a weighting scheme to define properties for a single, homogenous material model. The second investigates the impact of thermal property temperature dependence on predicted response. As with the investigation of <b>geologic</b> <b>structure,</b> noticeable differences in predicted temperatures (up to 29 {degrees}C) were found to result...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this work}} is to {{interpret}} the <b>geologic</b> <b>structures</b> of the Agourai area (Paleozoic and Mesozoic structures) from processed magnetic maps. The detected magnetic anomalies from different standard methods used in aeromagnetism (Residual map, RTP map, horizontal gradient map) were compared to <b>geologic</b> <b>structures</b> and permit enhancing the mapping quality of some areas, and thus defining many geologic features. Existing geologic maps and geologic field studies allow interpreting some detected anomalies. It was thus possible to define the limits between the Paleozoic basement and the Mesozoic cover, to determine magnetic anomalies according to NE-SW trends compatible with the regional <b>geologic</b> <b>structures</b> and finally to detect a NE to SW-oriented fault system in the Mesozoic cover of the Agourai Plateau. Despite the reliability of this approach, some folded basaltic sills occurring in this region were not well detected, probably because of their reduced thickness...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Three {{dimensional}} {{seismic survey}} {{carried out in}} the western Nankai Accretionary Prism off Muroto succeeded in imaging of clear <b>geologic</b> <b>structure</b> and detailed distribution of BSR. Topography and <b>geologic</b> <b>structure</b> influence the distribution of BSR in the survey area. Especially, depths of BSRs obviously change along out-of-sequence thrusts. In large thrust zone, BSR in the hanging wall of a large thrust reaches down to the thrust, while the footwall does not have clear BSR. Heat flow values calculated from depth of BSR indicate that more intensive fluid convection occurs toward the toe of the Nankai prism. Heat flow increases seaward in each faults unit bounded by out-of-sequence thrusts, and the heat flow drops down at the out-of-sequence thrusts. The same seaward increase and the drop are duplicated at each fault block cut by minor scale thrust. These features give rise to more speculation related to an interaction between <b>geologic</b> <b>structure,</b> fluid migration, and development of BSR and gas hydrate deposits. 1...|$|R
40|$|Analytical {{modeling}} for {{static and}} dynamic foundation stability evaluations is most realistic when the three-dimensional (3 D) <b>geologic</b> <b>structure</b> {{is included in}} the model so potential sliding surfaces can be accurately analyzed.

A major synform five miles wide and more than 20 miles long has been identified in the metamorphic rocks north of Danville, Va. Structures in the metavolcanic Carolina slate belt are also identifiable near {{the confluence of the}} Dan and Staunton Rivers. Cleared land and other cultural features tend to coincide with topographic reflection of geologic units, thus enhancing the ERTS- 1 resolution of some <b>geologic</b> <b>structures.</b> In other cases pseudostructures may be identified when regular geometric configurations of culture bear little or no relation to underlying geologic units.

40|$|This report {{represents}} {{a continuation of}} gravity work in the Cascade Mountains of Washington supported by the Division of Geology and Earth Resources since 1974. The purpose of this research has been collection of baseline gravity data for use in geothermal resource evaluation. Results of the Division's gravity studies to date are given in Danes and Phillips (1983 a, 1983 b). One of the problems encountered when analyzing gravity data is distinguishing between {{those parts of the}} data that represent <b>geologic</b> <b>structures</b> of interest, and those that do not. In many cases, the features of interest are relatively small, near-surface features, such as those sought in mineral, petroleum, or geothermal exploration. Gravity anomalies caused by such structures may be distorted or masked by anomalies caused by larger, deeper <b>geologic</b> <b>structures.</b> Gravity anomalies caused by relatively shallow, small <b>geologic</b> <b>structures</b> are termed residual anomalies. Those due to broad, deep-seated features can be described as regional anomalies. The purpose of this report is to describe a Fourier analysis method for separating residual and regional gravity anomalies from a complete Bouguer gravity anomaly field. The technique has been applied to gravity data from the Southern Cascade Mountains, Washington. Residual gravity anomaly maps at a scale of 1 : 250, 000 are presented for various regional wavelength filters, and a power spectrum of the frequency components in the South Cascade gravity data is displayed.

40|$|The {{geologic}} {{architecture in}} aquifer systems affects {{the behavior of}} fluid flow and the dispersion of mass. The spatial distribution and connectivity of higher-permeability facies play an important role. Models that represent this <b>geologic</b> <b>structure</b> have reduced entropy in the spatial distribution of permeability relative to models without structure. The literature shows that the stochastic model with the greatest variance {{in the distribution of}} predictions (i. e., the most conservative model) will not simply be the model representing maximum disorder in the permeability field. This principle is further explored using the Shannon entropy as a single metric to quantify and compare model parametric spatial disorder to the temporal distribution of mass residence times in model predictions. The principle is most pronounced when <b>geologic</b> <b>structure</b> manifests as preferential-flow pathways through the system via connected high-permeability sediments. As per percolation theory, at certain volume fractions the full connectivity of the high-permeability sediments will not be represented unless the model is three-dimensional. At these volume fractions, two-dimensional models can profoundly underrepresent the entropy in the real, three-dimensional, aquifer system. Thus to be conservative, stochastic models must be three-dimensional and include <b>geologic</b> <b>structure...</b>|$|R
