500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the year, Wings {{also carried}} out overdubs at the newly built Replica Studio, located at MPL's Soho Square offices. Frustrated at the {{impending}} unavailability of Abbey Road's Studio Two – which studio owner and record company EMI needed for its other acts, besides Wings – McCartney had constructed an exact replica of Studio Two in the basement at MPL. Among the work done on Back to the Egg at Replica, the band replaced the final twenty seconds of [...] "So <b>Glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>See</b> <b>You</b> Here" [...] with what Madinger and Easter describe as [...] "a reggae-styled coda", containing the [...] "We're Open Tonight" [...] reprise.|$|E
500|$|Brig. Gen. Archer was {{captured}} in the fighting, the first general officer in Robert E. Lee's army to suffer that fate. Archer was most likely positioned around the 14th Tennessee when he {{was captured}} by Private Patrick Moloney of Company G., 2nd Wisconsin, [...] "a brave patriotic and fervent young Irishman." [...] Archer resisted capture, but Moloney overpowered him. Moloney was killed later that day, but he received the Medal of Honor for his exploit. When Archer {{was taken to the}} rear, he encountered his former Army colleague Gen. Doubleday, who greeted him good-naturedly, [...] "Good morning, Archer! How are you? I am glad to see you!" [...] Archer replied, [...] "Well, I am not <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> by a damn sight!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Dear Tom, I am <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>thee</b> {{with all}} my heart, let me die. Come, let us go take a bottle, we must not part so; pr'ythee let's go and be drunk by God." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A bit stiffer in the joints, {{and maybe}} a bit sourer," [...] was the answer. Then the man's {{wrinkled}} face relaxed. [...] "I'm main <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>thee,</b> Mr. Wallace. Master wad have come, only he'd t' gan t' Manchester suddenly." ...|$|R
500|$|In 1915, the C.L.Best Gas Traction Co. {{exhibited}} its new [...] "Tracklayer" [...] at the California state fair. Holt {{once again}} sued, {{this time for}} patent infringement. C.L.Best thought that his best defense was to prove that Holt's patents violated Lombard's patents. One of Best's lawyers, Henry Montgomery, visited Lombard and sought his assistance as a friendly witness. Lombard was more than friendly. He allegedly responded, [...] "By God, young man, I'm <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> If God Almighty could charter me to kill a man, I'd get on the train and go to California and kill old Ben Holt." [...] Best bought all rights to Lombard's 1901 and 1907 patents for $20,000, which pre-dated Holt's [...] "crawler" [...] patents also purchased from Lombard. Holt's earlier rights to the Lombard patents were annulled and Best counter-sued Holt.|$|E
500|$|... "The Broadcast" [...] {{is another}} instrumental, {{designed}} {{to give the impression}} of several radio signals interlaced, and bringing full-circle the concept established in the album's opening track, [...] "Reception". Over a musical backing of piano, mellotron and gizmotron, it features readings taken from the plays The Sport of Kings by Ian Hay and The Little Man by John Galsworthy. As a return to the proposed working-band concept, [...] "So <b>Glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>See</b> <b>You</b> Here", Rodriguez writes, [...] " [...] the anticipation of a live act guaranteed to 'knock 'em dead'" [...] and so recalls Wings' 1975–76 show-opening medley [...] "Venus and Mars/Rock Show". During the outro, the band reprise a line from [...] "We're Open Tonight". The album ends with a jazz-inflected ballad, [...] "Baby's Request", which McCartney wrote for American vocal group the Mills Brothers, after seeing them perform in the South of France during the summer of 1978.|$|E
500|$|Music critic Robert Christgau said of McCartney {{and the new}} Wings album: [...] "When he's on, Paulie's {{abundant}} tunefulness {{passes for}} generosity. Here he's just hoping something will stick." [...] In Melody Maker, Ray Coleman wrote that McCartney [...] "seems {{to be on a}} treadmill of banality". Coleman described [...] "Rockestra Theme" [...] and [...] "So <b>Glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>See</b> <b>You</b> Here" [...] as [...] "creditable, rolling, raunchy and at least efficient, with Paul's voice at its rocking best on the last named track", but concluded: [...] "This album gets Wings nowhere..." [...] Billboards reviewer gave Back to the Egg [...] "Spotlight" [...] status (meaning [...] "the most outstanding new product of the week's releases and that with the greatest potential for top of the chart placement") and commented: [...] "The music features typical McCartney fare of late with nothing here that will distinguish it as one of his classics. The arrangements, though, are interesting, encompassing a variety of styles." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I would I {{could say}} with truth that I am <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>thee,</b> cousin," [...] he said, [...] "but I fear me that thine errand to the King {{is not likely}} to end in {{pleasant}} intercourse, if all be true that is reported of the folk in Horlingdal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{are welcome}} too, M. Chapeau; {{they are very}} welcome too. I am <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> ye, safe and sound from the wars, lads. I am <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>thee,</b> Jean: I am <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>thee,</b> Peter," [...] and he gave a hand {{to each of the}} two young men, who were delighted with their {{unexpected}} kind reception. [...] "And this I will say before the neighbours here, as ye would go to the wars, and make soldiers of yourselves, I am well pleased to hear ye behaved yourselves like gallant brave men should do. I'd sooner that your friends should have had to tell me that ye were both stiff and cold, than that ye should have returned yourselves with shamed faces to own that ye had disgraced the trade ye have chosen to take up with." ...|$|R
500|$|Sessions {{moved to}} Abbey Road Studios in London on 3 October. That day, Wings joined with a {{supergroup}} of guest musicians, collectively known as [...] "Rockestra", {{to record the}} tracks [...] "Rockestra Theme" [...] and [...] "So <b>Glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>See</b> <b>You</b> Here". A camera crew led by Barry Chattington filmed the proceedings, and a 40-minute documentary, titled Rockestra, was later compiled from the footage. Equipment used for this session included 60 microphones, a pair of mixing consoles and a 16-track recording desk. James Honeyman-Scott of the Pretenders, Hank Marvin of the Shadows, the Who's Pete Townshend, Pink Floyd's David Gilmour, Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones and John Bonham, and the Attractions' Bruce Thomas all took part. Also among the line-up was the horn section from Wings' 1975–76 world tour, consisting of Howie Casey, Tony Dorsey, Thaddeus Richard and Steve Howard. Keith Moon was meant to participate, but he had died shortly before the session; Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton were also scheduled to appear.|$|E

2500|$|When the American team {{returned}} from London, President Theodore Roosevelt hosted them at his Sagamore Hill home on Long Island, and singled out Murphy for special recognition. As U.S. Olympic Committee Chairman James Sullivan introduced Murphy to the President, Roosevelt interrupted: [...] "We don't {{have to be}} introduced. I am might <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> He is an American institution; {{and we are all}} glad to meet Mike." [...] Upon their return, the American team also presented Murphy with a silver loving cup in gratitude for his efforts.|$|E

"I am <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>thee,</b> Eliza,--very," [...] said Ruth, shaking hands, as if Eliza were an {{old friend}} she had long been expecting; [...] "and this is thy dear boy,--I brought a cake for him," [...] she said, holding out a little heart to the boy, who came up, gazing through his curls, and {{accepted}} it shyly.|$|R

2500|$|Medwin {{rebelled against}} his father's wish that he become a lawyer, causing a quarrel, {{the result of}} which was Thomas' {{omission}} from his father's will, executed in 1829. There {{was a period of}} drift in Medwin's life, in which he attempted to live beyond his means as a gentleman. Considerable debts appear to have been paid by his family. These activities involved much carousing and gambling at his club in Brighton and generally spending money on collecting art. Shelley recalled Medwin as painting well and [...] "remarkable, if I do not mistake, for a particular taste in, and knowledge of the belli arti – Italy is the place for you, the very place – the Paradise of Exiles... If you will be glad to see an old friend, who will be <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you...</b> come to Italy." [...] Medwin's financial situation could not continue as it was, and by 1812 he had accepted a military commission in the 24th Light Dragoons, a regiment where he could pursue his social pretensions.|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Bonham {{appeared}} on The Family Dogg's A Way of Life, with Page and Jones. Bonham also played for Screaming Lord Sutch on Lord Sutch and Heavy Friends in 1970. He played on Lulu's 1971 single [...] "Everybody Clap (Lulu song)," [...] written by Maurice Gibb and Billy Lawrie. In 1972, he {{played on a}} Maurice Gibb-produced album by Jimmy Stevens called Don't Freak Me Out in the UK and Paid My Dues in the US, credited as [...] "Gemini" [...] (his star sign).

He was also featured on Paul McCartney & Wings [...] "Beware My Love" [...] demo version first recorded in 1976, it remained unreleased until 2014 {{with the release of}} the album Wings at the Speed of Sound boxset.
