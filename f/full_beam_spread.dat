40|$|We have {{developed}} a computer program interfaced with the ACNET environment of Fermilab accelerators to measure energy spread of the proton beam from the LINAC at an injection into the Booster. It uses a digitizing oscilloscope and provides users an ability to configure the scope settings for optimal data acquisition from a resistive wall current monitor. When the program is launched, a) a one shot timeline is generated to initiate beam injection into the Booster, b) a gap of about 40 ns is produced in the injected beam using a set of fast kickers, c) collects line charge distribution data from the wall current monitor for the first 200 μs from the injection and d) performs complete data analysis to extract <b>full</b> <b>beam</b> energy <b>spread</b> of the <b>beam.</b> The program also gives the option to store the data for offline analyses. We illustrate a case with an example. We also present results on <b>beam</b> energy <b>spread</b> {{as a function of}} beam intensity from recent measurements. Comment: 5 p...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{pulse-echo}} ultrasonic NDE {{techniques are}} useful in the evaluation for structural flaws in components manufactured from homogeneous materials (i. e. most metals). However, composite materials are often neither homogeneous nor isotropic which decreases the sensitivity of traditional techniques by making the resultant data difficult to interpret. Composite materials also tend to attenuate the ultrasonic energy {{to a greater degree}} than metals decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio needed for confident flaw detection. The attenuation is attributed to the absorption of energy by the matrix and the scattering of energy due to the inherent scatterers in the system such as fibers and small voids or porosity. For very thick composites these difficulties are amplified. In addition, a component of the attenuation due to ultrasonic <b>beam</b> <b>spreading</b> increases with thickness.
