5|$|<b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> {{that the}} figure above for Chongqing's Administrative Area {{includes}} the entire Municipality of Chongqing whereas the City Population only counts the urbanized districts making up Chongqing city.

5|$|Rapp (1933) {{compares the}} Nafaanra numerals for three (táárɛ) and hundred (lafaa) with eta and ke-lafa from Mpre, a {{hitherto}} unclassified language from Ghana. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> however that Mpre eta is Kwa-like (cf. Brong esã, Ga etɛ), whereas the Nafaanra form táárɛ is transparently {{related to the}} forms found in the other (non-Kwa) Senufo languages (e.g. Supyire tàànrè).|$|E
5|$|Several diseases, like Rat Coronavirus Infection (RCI), Sendai virus, and Murine Respiratory Mycoplasmosis (MRM, Mycoplasma pulmonis), are {{prevalent}} {{simply because}} their highly contagious natures work {{in tandem with}} the way rats are kept in laboratories, pet stores, and by breeders. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted,</b> however, that MRM is far less likely to occur in laboratory rats than in those kept as pets.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the city}} is the most {{populated}} of Extremadura, it has a relatively low population density (102.30 hab/km²), due to the extension of its municipality, {{one of the largest}} in Spain, with an area of 1,470km². <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that in addition to the metropolitan centre the population includes districts, neighborhoods and towns with small populations, the most populous of which is Guadiana del Caudillo, which had 2,524 people as of 2012, but gained independence on 17 February 2012.|$|E
5|$|As with FreeBSD and OpenBSD, the {{developers}} of DragonFly BSD are slowly replacing K style C code with more modern, ANSI equivalents.

5|$|Camuston {{no longer}} exists as a village, but for {{location}} see for example the 1794 map by Ainslie. The Camuston Cross, once thought to mark the place of Camus' death, is now {{thought to be a}} late Pictish era monument, dating from the 10th Century. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that 'Camus' is not recognisable as a Scandinavian name, and that there are earlier variants of the place name, e.g. 'Cambistown' as it is called in documents from 1425–6, which has a Celtic etymology.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> {{that in the}} {{original}} Akkadian, Ú-a-a-te is {{used to refer to}} the first names of both Yauta ibn Hazail (son of Hazael) and Uayte ben Birdadda (son of Birdadda). The latter is also sometimes referred to as Ia-u-ta- and in the inscriptions of Ashurbanipal, the two spellings were confused, with both written Ú-a-a-te. The transliteration of {{the original}} Akkadian into English is highly unstable and only some of the alternate spellings appear in this article.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> {{that the}} {{relative}} atomic mass of the electron Ar(e) is measured relative to the mass of a carbon-12 atom (divided by 12). When the Avogadro constant {{is set in the}} new SI, atomic masses might be measured in dalton (by fixing the Avogadro constant), instead of atomic mass units (by fixing the mass of carbon-12), thus resulting in a difference between the values of the {{relative atomic mass}} and the atomic mass in units of dalton.|$|E

30|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> {{that this}} {{proposed}} approach is less conservative that {{searching for a}} common Lyapunov function. In fact, in [37] the authors introduced a simple linear example without time-delay for which a common Lyapunov function does not exist. Therefore, we cannot guarantee stability under arbitrary switching.|$|R
5|$|The athletes met the {{expectations}} of UK Sport for total medals, gold medals and medal table position, finishing second behind hosts China with 42 gold and 102 total medals. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that the medals claimed were not all ones that had been targeted, the team fell short of targets in some sports whilst it exceeded them in others; out of the fifteen sports set a target eight succeeded in meeting them.|$|E
5|$|German has 13,444 {{speakers}} representing about 0.4% of the state's population, and Vietnamese {{is spoken}} by 11,330 people, or about 0.4% of the population, {{many of whom}} live in the Asia District of Oklahoma City.

In addition to Cherokee, more than 25 Native American languages are spoken in Oklahoma, second only to California (though, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> only Cherokee exhibits language vitality at present).|$|E
5|$|Individual {{contributions}} made up {{the most}} of the campaign cash that Tancredo received, making up about 97% of his total pocketbook. PAC contributions were comparably low, producing only around $75,500, of the $1,311,869. He granted himself $200 for the campaign and received no federal funding. $88,457 of his money came from interest from the campaign's bank accounts and loans from outside sources. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that the majority of Tancredo's funds were not disclosed during the campaign As of September 30, 2007 the campaign raised $3,538,244 and spent $3,458,130, leaving only $110,079 cash on hand.|$|E

5|$|King's {{was ranked}} joint 14th overall in The Sunday Times 10-year (1998–2007) average ranking of British {{universities}} based on consistent league table performance. In recent years, however, {{the university has}} performed less well in domestic league tables, being placed outside of the top 20 in all three major tables for 2016. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that the methodologies of these tables include student satisfaction scores with teaching and feedback as a significant input. In common with most other London institutions, King's performs less well on the National Student Survey (NSS), ranking 133rd for student satisfaction (out of 160 institutes) in the 2015 survey.|$|E
5|$|Many small {{communities}} obtain their drinking water from diverse sources (lakes, streams, springs and groundwater wells). Levels of treatment vary widely, from rudimentary systems with coarse screening or settling followed by disinfection (usually chlorination), to more sophisticated systems using a filtration step. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that unless {{a high quality}} source is used, such as secure groundwater, disinfection alone is unlikely to guarantee that drinking water is safe from protozoa such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium, which are relatively resistant to standard disinfectants and which require additional removal steps such as filtration.|$|E
5|$|The {{albatross}} diet {{is predominantly}} cephalopods, fish, crustaceans, and offal (organ meat), although {{they will also}} scavenge carrion and feed on other zooplankton. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that for most species a comprehensive understanding of diet is known for only the breeding season, when the albatrosses regularly return to land and study is possible. The importance {{of each of these}} food sources varies from species to species, and even from population to population; some concentrate on squid alone, others take more krill or fish. Of the two albatross species found in Hawaii, one, the black-footed albatross, takes mostly fish while the Laysan feeds on squid.|$|E
