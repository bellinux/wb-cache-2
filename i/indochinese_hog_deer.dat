50|$|The <b>Indochinese</b> <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> (Hyelaphus annamiticus; Also called Annamite deer or Thai hog deer) is {{a species}} of hog deer native to Cambodia, Laos, People's Republic of China and Vietnam. It has been extirpated from Thailand.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally {{there have}} been two {{classified}} subspecies of hog deer: Indian hog deer (Hyelaphus porcinus porcinus) and the <b>Indochinese</b> <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> (Hyelaphus porcinus annamiticus). However recent morphological studies indicate they are better off as two separate species.|$|E

50|$|There are two {{separate}} but similar island <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> species: The Bawean deer (H. kuhlii) of Bawean Island in Indonesia, and the Calamian deer (H. calamianensis) of the Calamian Islands in the Philippines that inhabit moist or dry {{tropical deciduous forest}} environments. Unlike the best known western populations of the <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> (A. porcinus), their fawns are not spotted at birth. However, the eastern populations (perhaps equalling the subspecies A. p. annamiticus) of the <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> also have unspotted fawn. The two island <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> may be remnants of a widespread population of <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> {{that at one time}} were connected to the <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> populations of mainland Southeast Asia and inhabited vast areas of the Sunda Shelf during times of lower ocean levels.|$|R
50|$|The Bawean deer (Hyelaphus kuhlii), {{also known}} as Kuhl's <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> or Bawean <b>hog</b> <b>deer,</b> is a highly {{threatened}} species of deer found only in the island of Bawean (Gresik Regency) in Indonesia.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sika deer}} is {{protected}} as a Class I endangered species by the state, {{though it is}} classified by the [...] International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as least concern. Another Class I protected deer is the Thorold's or white-lipped deer. This large deer {{with a population of}} about 15,000 that is endemic to Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, Tibet and Yunnan, is considered vulnerable by the IUCN. The Chinese population of Eld's deer, a Class I protected species that is also considered endangered by IUCN, is found only on the island of Hainan. For decades, the <b>Indochinese</b> <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> was believed to be extinct in China until a fawn was discovered in 2007 in the Yongde Daxueshan National Wildlife Reserve. The <b>Indochinese</b> <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> is also protected by the state.Perhaps the most remarkable endangered deer species in China is Père David's deer. This deer, colloquially known as the sibuxiang or the [...] "Four-Not-Look-Alike", is said to have the hooves of an ox, antlers of a deer, neck of a camel and tail of a donkey, but does not look like any one animal. According to Chinese legend, this animal helped the ancient sage Jiang Ziya overthrow the tyrant king of the Shang Dynasty 4,000 years ago and became a symbol of good fortune. Chinese emperors kept the sibuxiang also called milu in imperial hunting parks, even as the animal became extinct in the wild, perhaps as early as 2,000 years ago. By 1866, when Father Armand David identified the animal, there were only 200-300 remaining in the Nanhaizi Royal Park in Beijing. A few animals were sold to zoos in Europe before 1894, when the park was flooded and some of the animals escaped only to be hunted and eaten. The last of the animals in China died during the chaos of the Boxer Rebellion. In 1898, Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford assembled a herd of 18 animals from European zoos and bred them at his estate, Woburn Abbey in England. In 1985, 22 deer from this herd was reintroduced back to the Nanhaizi Park in Beijing and in 1986 another 39 were sent to Dafeng, in northern Jiangsu on the Yellow Sea. In 1998, eight animals in the latter herd were introduced into wilderness of the Dafeng Milu National Wildlife Reserve. By 2013, the reserve had 196 Père David's deer.|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to study population characteristics of <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> released into the wild, namely: density,age structure, sex ratio, recruitment rate, threats to <b>hog</b> <b>deer,</b> carrying capacity and inter-specific relationships, as well as toassess the population viability over time. In this study, direct observation was used to study the <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> population characteristics,and population density was estimated from the pellet-group count method. Vortex program was used to analyze thepopulation viability. Results showed that the population density of <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> at Thung Ka Mung (TKM) in Phu Khieo WildlifeSanctuary (PKWS) was 2. 03 - 2. 04 individuals/hectare (SD = 1. 25). The population structure showed that the average herd sizewas 9. 57 individuals. <b>Hog</b> <b>deer</b> in TKM preferred to stay with a group (91. 5 %), rather than being solitary (8. 5 %). The sex ratiofor males to females was 54. 64 : 100, and for females to fawns was 100 : 26. 18. The annual recruitment rate was 16. 98 %. Theirpredators were Asian wild dogs, Burmese pythons, Asiatic jackals, leopard cats and clouded leopards. The mortality rate ofthe existing <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> in TKM during the study period was 18. 1 %. The habitat sharing by camera traps revealed 4 ungulatespecies. They were sambar deer, barking deer, wild boar, and elephant, and their relative abundance were 28. 41 %, 7. 38 %, 4. 70 %, and 2. 01 % respectively. Fifty-year simulation modeling using population viability analysis indicated the sustainabilityof this population. <b>Hog</b> <b>deer</b> population in the simulations did not exhibit sensitivity to an increase or decrease in carryingcapacity. Habitat management should be carried out continuously in TKM area, which is the main habitat for <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> inPKWS...|$|R

50|$|<b>Hog</b> <b>deer</b> (Axis porcinus): <b>Hog</b> <b>deer</b> has a {{much wider}} {{distribution}} than chital and covers the area throughout the alluvial grassland of northern India, extending eastward to southern Nepal, Burma, Thailand, Indo-China, and Sri Lanka (Prater 1998). In Nepal, <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> are mainly concentrated in Chitwan, Karnali-Bardia and Sukla Phantas (Mishra 1982). Antlers consist of long bony pedicels with a short brow tine and a straight beam with a fork at the top (Prater 1998 and Mishra 1982). Fawning occurred from January to April in Chitwan (Dhungel and OGara 1991). Mishra and Wemmer (1987) found that the fawning season starts in February and increases until May. Tall grasses along the riverbanks, open phantas are favoured habitats. They are generally solitary but sometimes-small groups may graze together. During the hot {{hours of the day}} <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> shelter in tall grass and they feed {{early in the morning and}} in the evening (Dhungel and OGara 1991).|$|R

50|$|The antler of {{a mature}} <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> stag is {{typically}} three tined-brow tine with solid main beam terminating in {{inner and outer}} top tines. However, antlers with more points are not uncommon.

40|$|The <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> (Axis porcinus) {{is a small}} deer whose {{natural habitat}} is the wet or moist tall grasslands in South and Southeast Asia. Wild populations have {{dramatically}} decreased in recent decades. While wild <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> were recently acknowledged to be extinct in China, a few captive populations have been maintained. In the present study, we successfully employed the restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) technique to generate a genome-wide profile of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the captive population of <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> from Chengdu Zoo, China (N = 11). Up to 4. 7 million clean reads per sample were sequenced, and 11, 155 SNPs and 8, 247 haplotypes were simultaneously observed within more than 80 % of sequenced individuals. In this population, the mean frequency of major alleles at each polymorphism site was 0. 7903 ± 0. 0014, and the average nucleotide diversity (π) and inbreeding coefficient (FIS) were 0. 3031 ± 0. 0015 and - 0. 0302 ± 0. 0062, respectively. Additionally, the Euclidean distance-based multidimensional scaling method revealed that the pairwise genetic relatedness was evenly distributed. However, the results of homologous searching by short reads did not provide any meaningful explanation of the phylogenetic relationship of <b>hog</b> <b>deer,</b> which should be further investigated. In conclusion, our results revealed current state of genetic diversity in this captive population of <b>hog</b> <b>deer.</b> Furthermore, these genome-wide SNPs would be useful for guiding the mating schedule to avoid sharp increase of inbreeding coefficient...|$|R
