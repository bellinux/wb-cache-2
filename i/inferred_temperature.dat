40|$|The {{concentrations}} of chironomid remains in lake sediments are very variable and, therefore, chironomid stratigraphies often include samples {{with a low}} number of counts. Thus, the effect of low count sums on reconstructed temperatures {{is an important issue}} when applying chironomid‐temperature inference models. Using an existing data set, we simulated low count sums by randomly picking subsets of head capsules from surface‐sediment samples with a high number of specimens. Subsequently, a chironomid‐temperature inference model was used to assess how the <b>inferred</b> <b>temperatures</b> are affected by low counts. The simulations indicate that the variability of <b>inferred</b> <b>temperatures</b> increases progressively with decreasing count sums. At counts below 50 specimens, a further reduction in count sum can cause a disproportionate increase in the variation of <b>inferred</b> <b>temperatures,</b> whereas at higher count sums the inferences are more stable. Furthermore, low count samples may consistently infer too low or too high temperatures and, therefore, produce a systematic error in a reconstruction. Smoothing reconstructed temperatures downcore is proposed as a possible way to compensate for the high variability due to low count sums. By combining adjacent samples in a stratigraphy, to produce samples of a more reliable size, it is possible to assess if low counts cause a systematic error in <b>inferred</b> <b>temperatures...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{quantitative}} palaeoecology modern species-environmental relationships can be statistically modelled, {{and recent}} development {{has made the}} calibration models more statistically robust. These models are used to transform fossil assemblages to quantitative estimates of past environmental conditions. The aim of this thesis is to <b>infer</b> Holocene <b>temperatures</b> from fossil pollen data sampled from lakes in central and southern Sweden. This reconstruction is done by using a north-European pollen-climate calibration model, which was extended with 37 modern pollen samples from the southern deciduous vegetation zone in Sweden within this project. A statistical method is used for deriving the pollen-climate calibration model, weighted averaging partial least square (WA-PLS) method. The long term trends in pollen <b>inferred</b> <b>temperatures</b> from this study reflect low, but rapidly rising temperatures in the early-Holocene, a trend that was temporarily interrupted by a cool period about 8500 cal yr BP, but continued after 8000 cal yr BP. A Holocene thermal maximum (HTM) with temperatures roughly 2 °C higher than at present was recorded about 7000 cal yr BP and by 4000 cal yr BP pollen <b>inferred</b> <b>temperatures</b> starts to decline. In {{order to create a}} more comprehensive picture of past climate patterns in the investigated area <b>inferred</b> <b>temperatures</b> from this study are compared with independent palaeorecords, a stable oxygen isotope record for moisture variability (paper I) and chironomids for summer temperature (paper II).

Pollen <b>inferred</b> <b>temperatures</b> and the moisture record are indicating markedly dry, continental climate conditions in southern Sweden during the HTM possibly as a result of reorganisations in regional atmosphere circulations. The local observations in this study of regional climate events, such as the cold period at about 8200 cal yr BP and the dry period at about 7000 to 4000 cal yr BP are of particular interest because they suggest that vegetation in the study region has responded sensitively both to long-term climatic trends and more transient climate events...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of within-lake {{variation}} of subfossil chironomid assemblages on chironomid-inferred temperatures in five lakes in southern Norway. In each lake six replicate surface-sediment samples in the deepest part of the lake basin and two transects of seven samples each towards the littoral were analysed for subfossil chironomid assemblages. A quantitative chironomid–July air temperature inference model applied to the subfossil assemblages <b>inferred</b> <b>temperatures</b> {{with a standard deviation}} of 0. 35 – 0. 54 °C for the six mid-lake samples and of 0. 38 – 0. 59 °C for all 20 sediment samples. This variation seems high when compared with the cross-validated root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of the model of 1. 04 °C. However, we show that the variability of the replicate mid-lake samples can only account for a maximum of 15 % of the model prediction error if the RMSEP is decomposed into a component due to uncertainties associated with sampling the chironomid assemblage of a lake and into a residual error component. Thus, according to our results analysing multiple samples in the model lakes to obtain better estimates of their subfossil assemblage composition may only slightly reduce the model prediction error. It was difficult to detect a clear pattern of chironomid-inferred temperatures with respect to water depth in any single lake due to the high variability of inferred values. However, a comparison of all five study lakes revealed that, relative to the mid-lake samples, cooler <b>temperatures</b> were <b>inferred</b> at intermediate depths and warmer temperatures in the shallowest parts of the lakes, although two shallow-water samples with very low <b>inferred</b> <b>temperatures</b> were exceptions in this respect.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{increase}} in global climatic changes seen {{in recent years}} is debated to be a result from expanding anthropogenic activity. The aim for the study is to contribute to the climatic history at western Spitsbergen mainly focusing on the last 2000 years and recent climatic events. Palaeoecoloogical studies investigates the climatic history of the past, assessing the speed and direction of future climate changes, and suggest how much of the changes are man made or based on natural forces. Chironomids are a good indicator for temperature changes in the past and were in this study used for a temperature reconstruction in lake Tjørnskardet on western Spitsbergen. The sediment cores were dated back to ~ 6000 years BP. From the chironomid assembly, a temperature reconstruction was established based on reduced modern training set. A total of 26 taxa were found, with Micopsectra, Hydorbaenus and Oliviridia showing a considerable higher abundance compared {{to the rest of the}} taxa in the assemblage. The <b>inferred</b> <b>temperature</b> based on full modern training set and the reduced training set were compared to the results from the neighbouring lake, Skardtjørna together with the chironomid assemblage. The reconstructed temperature gradient shows an overall temperature decline from ~ 6000 years BP to present, in correspondence to Skardtjørna and other sites at Svalbard. Some major aberrant trends in the results indicate that there might be a strong correlation between the temperature and other environmental variables, which will influence the chironomid composition and weaken the reconstructed temperature. The comparisons of the temperature from the training sets reveal that the <b>inferred</b> <b>temperature</b> based on the full training set showed more resemblance between the lakes...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the vertical and temporal distribution of Thaumarchaeota derived core isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) lipids through sampling and analysis of both suspended particulate matter from the water column at different times in the annual cycle and a 3 year long record of settling particles in two sediment traps at different depths at an open lake location in Lake Superior. Results from these analyses suggest that Thaumarchaeota were present throughout the water column during times of overturning, but mainly resided below {{the depth of the}} thermocline (20 – 40 m) during the period of thermal stratification. Fluxes of thaumarchaeotal produced GDGTs were highly periodic and mainly occurred during two periods of the annual cycle (winter and late spring/early summer). A covariance of both branched and isoprenoid GDGT fluxes with the mass accumulation flux combined with the observation that those periods of maximum fluxes were associated with increased BIT index values, however, suggest that these two periods of elevated fluxes may be related to an influx of resuspended particles transported from shallower near shore regions of Lake Superior. During all sampling periods TEX 86 <b>inferred</b> <b>temperatures</b> from SPM were in good agreement with in situ water temperatures of the depths at which the SPM was sampled. The observed range of TEX 86 <b>inferred</b> <b>temperatures</b> in 3 years of settling particles is relatively small and does not show significantly higher <b>inferred</b> <b>temperatures</b> during the thermally stratified period, indicating that the sedimentary TEX 86 signal during the summer thermally stratified period mainly originated from depths below the relatively shallow thermocline. Additionally, TEX 86 values during the winter period of increased fluxes did not capture the decrease in water temperatures observed throughout the water column during this period, and thus may be a further indication that the thaumarchaeotal lipid flux was the result of sediment focusing. Flux-weighted TEX 86 <b>inferred</b> <b>temperatures</b> from both sediment traps were in good agreement with TEX 86 temperatures from surface sediments from the same location in Lake Superior. Both flux weighted TEX 86 temperatures from the sediment traps and average TEX 86 temperatures from surface sediments were similar to averaged measured water temperatures at below 40 m depth within the error of the lacustrine TEX 86 calibration. Based on the observed depths of Thaumarchaeota in the water column, TEX 86 values in sediments of Lake Superior likely reflect a combination of mixed-season and sub-thermocline temperatures. This is effectively the same as the annual averaged water temperature observed at depths below 40 m in Lake Superior. Thus, trends in TEX 86 <b>inferred</b> <b>temperatures</b> in sediment records of Lake Superior, and similar lakes, are likely to reflect subsurface temperature variability rather than that of surface temperature...|$|R
