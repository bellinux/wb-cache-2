5|$|The away team scans Armus' energy field, {{finding that}} when Armus engulfs {{the shuttle and}} speaks to Troi, expressing his remorse and pity, the field disrupting their {{transporter}} signals is weakened which could allow them to beam Troi and the pilot out of the shuttle. After Armus toys with Troi by completely engulfing Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Captain Picard beams down to speak to Armus directly, sending {{the rest of the}} away team to the ship. Picard engages Armus in a heated discussion to discover its motive, which <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> revenge on those that abandoned it on Vagra II. Armus is riled to a point where the energy field is dissipated enough, allowing for Picard, Troi and the pilot to be safely beamed back to the Enterprise. After destroying the shuttlecraft from orbit, Picard orders a quarantine on Vagra II.|$|E

25|$|Christianity has {{its roots}} in Judaism, and shares much of the latter faith's ontology, its central beliefs derive from the teachings of Jesus Christ, as {{presented}} in the New Testament. Life's purpose in Christianity <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> divine salvation through the grace of God and intercession of Christ. (cf. John 11:26) The New Testament speaks of God wanting to have a relationship with humans both in this life and the life to come, which can happen only if one's sins are forgiven (John 3:16–21; 2 Peter 3:9).|$|E
25|$|At {{the most}} basic level, the best defense against floods <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> higher ground for high-value uses while {{balancing}} the foreseeable risks with the benefits of occupying flood hazard zones. Critical community-safety facilities, such as hospitals, emergency-operations centers, and police, fire, and rescue services, should be built in areas least at risk of flooding. Structures, such as bridges, that must unavoidably be in flood hazard areas should be designed to withstand flooding. Areas most at risk for flooding could be put to valuable uses that could be abandoned temporarily as people retreat to safer areas when a flood is imminent.|$|E
25|$|North Korea's policy <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> reunification without what it sees as outside interference, {{through a}} federal {{structure}} retaining each side's leadership and systems. In 1973, it proposed forming a Confederal Republic of Koryo that would represent the Korean {{people in the}} UN. North Korean President Kim Il-sung elaborated on the proposed state (then called Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo) on October 10, 1980, in the Report to the Sixth Congress of the Worker's Party of Korea on the Work of the Central Committee. Kim proposed a federation between North and South Korea, in which their respective political systems would initially remain.|$|E

25|$|When {{dentures}} {{no longer}} fit well, the correct action <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> follow-up care. Using denture adhesive may improve the fit, but {{it tends to}} work better when {{only a small amount}} is used as covering the denture fitting surface in adhesive makes it stay in less well. Adhesives may compensate for gradual loosening of a denture, but it is only a temporary solution; it does not solve the problem. Fortunately, dentures can often be relined with relining materials to restore the proper fit, and this process costs less than creation of new dentures. Overall, a well-made denture should last about 5 years or more.|$|E
25|$|Part of Cruzado's {{governing}} style <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> out {{the views}} of others. In her first year in office, she held meetings across the state to solicit citizen views on the university. She also met one-on-one {{with many of the}} state's agricultural leaders. In September 2010 Cruzado began holding monthly luncheon meetings open to any who wished to attend, to solicit input on a variety of ideas. An example of this aspect of her governance style is her football stadium listening session. When she proposed spending several million dollars to expand the MSU football arena, she held a two-hour session with students to obtain their views and ensure it was what they wanted.|$|E
25|$|Self-replicating probes could exhaustively {{explore a}} galaxy {{the size of}} the Milky Way in as little as a million years. If even a single civilization in the Milky Way {{attempted}} this, such probes could spread throughout the entire galaxy. Another speculation for contact with an alien probe—one that would be trying to find human beings—is an alien Bracewell probe. Such a hypothetical device would be an autonomous space probe whose purpose <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> out and communicate with alien civilizations (as opposed to Von Neumann probes, which are usually described as purely exploratory). These were proposed as an alternative to carrying a slow speed-of-light dialogue between vastly distant neighbors. Rather than contending with the long delays a radio dialogue would suffer, a probe housing an artificial intelligence would seek out an alien civilization to carry on a close-range communication with the discovered civilization. The findings of such a probe would still have to be transmitted to the home civilization at light speed, but an information-gathering dialogue could be conducted in real time.|$|E

Grandmaster (GM) András Adorján wrote {{a series of}} books on the theme that [...] "Black is OK!", arguing that the general perception that White has an advantage is founded more in psychology than reality. GM Mihai Suba and others contend that sometimes White's initiative disappears {{for no apparent reason}} as a game progresses. The prevalent style of play for Black today <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> dynamic, unbalanced positions with active counterplay, rather than merely trying to equalize.|$|E
500|$|This myth {{was derived}} from two misconceptions: First, that tornadoes always travel in a northeasterly direction, and second, that debris from a {{structure}} will be carried away {{in the direction of}} the tornado's propagation, leaving anyone taking shelter on the side of the structure facing the tornado's approach unharmed. The seriousness of these misconceptions began to be revealed in the 1960s and 1970s, when surveys of major tornado damage in residential areas showed that the section of a house {{in the direction of the}} tornado's approach is actually the [...] safe. Additionally, many tornadoes have traveled in directions other than northeasterly, including the Jarrell Tornado (F5 on the Fujita scale), which moved south-southwesterly. Because determining a tornado's direction of approach can take time away from seeking shelter, official advice <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> shelter in an interior room on the lowest floor of a building, under a staircase, I-beam, or sturdy piece of furniture if possible.|$|E

The title of [...] "The Master Plan" [...] stemmed from the fact that real-life municipal planning documents in small American towns are often called the [...] "master plan", like the one Leslie refers to in the episode. Schur said of this, [...] "It seems so funny to call the municipal budgets and planning documents for a small city in Indiana the 'master plan'." [...] Schur said the Parks and Recreation writing staff believed the title of the episode was appropriate because the subplots of [...] "The Master Plan" [...] revolved around the various plans of the characters.
