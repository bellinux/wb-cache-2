40|$|In recent years, {{the utility}} {{industry}} {{has turned to}} baghouses as an alternative technology for particulate emission control from pulverized-coal-fired power plants. One of the more significant issues is to improve poor gas distribution that causes bag failures in baghouse operation. Bag failures during operation are almost impossible to prevent, but proper flow design can help in their prevention. This study investigated vertical velocity profiles below the bags in a baghouse (the hopper region) to determine whether flow could be improved with the installation of <b>flow</b> <b>distributors</b> in the hopper region. Three types of <b>flow</b> <b>distributors</b> were used to improve flow distribution and were compared with the original baghouse without <b>flow</b> <b>distributors.</b> Velocity profiles were measured by a hot-wire anemometer at an inlet velocity of 18 m/sec. Uniformity of flow distribution was calculated by the uniformity value U for the velocity profile of each <b>flow</b> <b>distributor.</b> Experimental {{results showed that the}} velocity profile of the empty configuration (without <b>flow</b> <b>distributors)</b> was poor because the uniformity value was 2. 048. The uniformity values of type 1 (<b>flow</b> <b>distributor</b> with three vertical vanes), type 2 (<b>flow</b> <b>distributor</b> with one vertical and one inclined vane), and type 3 (<b>flow</b> <b>distributor</b> with two inclined vanes) configurations were reduced to 1. 051, 0. 617, and 0. 526, respectively. These results indicate that the <b>flow</b> <b>distributors</b> designed in this study made significant improvements in the velocity profile of a baghouse, with the type 3 configuration having the best performance...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{we report}} our {{experimental}} {{results of the}} PEM fuel cell with metal foam as <b>flow</b> <b>distributor.</b> These experimental results show {{the characteristics of the}} PEM fuel cell with the metal foam as <b>flow</b> <b>distributor</b> and extend our understanding of the relation between cell performance and mass transport properties into a region of parameters that the conventional PEM unit cell cannot provide. The comparison in polarization curve is made between the PEM unit cell with different metal-foam properties and the PEM unit cell with graphite flow channel plate as <b>flow</b> <b>distributor.</b> The experimental results show that the PEM fuel cell with metal foam as <b>flow</b> <b>distributor</b> possesses some unique characteristics compared with the conventional PEM unit cell with flow channel plate as <b>flow</b> <b>distributor.</b> The unique characteristics are listed in this paper with our preliminary analysis. Due to the high porosity of metal-foam (as high as 95 %) plus convective flow through the metal-foam, mass transport limitation phenomenon is not as pronounced {{as in the case of}} conventional PEM unit cell with flow channel plate as <b>flow</b> <b>distributor.</b> Another interesting phenomenon is that electrical conductivity of metal-foam plays a significant role in performance, which is seldom the case in the conventional PEM unit cell with flow channel plate as <b>flow</b> <b>distributor.</b> Although there are several technical challenges to be overcome for the current form of metal-foam to replace flow channel plates, the unique mass-transport properties of metal foam plus its light weight are very attractive.

40|$|Two main {{groups of}} <b>flow</b> <b>distributors,</b> viz. "bifurcating distributors" (BF) and "radially {{interconnected}} distributors" (RI), {{as well as}} some hybrid distributors were investigated. Computational fluid dynamics was used to evaluate the performance of the distributors and to establish the design yielding the most uniform velocity field and the smallest variance for the bands emerging from the distributor. A minimum channel width of 100 mu m was considered to allow the use of micro-milling techniques for chip fabrication. The main factors that influenced the values of band variances were identified. The performance of the distributors was found to correlate most strongly with the volume of the <b>flow</b> <b>distributors.</b> The separation bed should be positioned immediately after, but not against the <b>flow</b> <b>distributor.</b> It was concluded that BF distributors perform best in terms of band variance. The values of band variances for the BF distributor decreased with increasing angle between bifurcation branches and the lowest value of about 0. 01 mm(2) was found for alpha = 175 degrees. Both BF and RI <b>flow</b> <b>distributors</b> were found to perform reasonably well when imperfections were present in the structure. However, severe blockages (exceeding 75 % of the cross-sectional area and length) of channels in, especially, BF <b>flow</b> <b>distributors</b> may jeopardize their performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.

40|$|Flow field {{design of}} fuel cells has a {{significant}} impact on the distribution of the reactants over the active surface area. In this work, the cell performance and transport characteristics of high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells with metal foams as <b>flow</b> <b>distributor</b> were numerically investigated by a three-dimensional and non-isothermal model. Compared to the fuel cell with conventional straight flow channels, the cell performance is considerably improved by the application of a metal foam as <b>flow</b> <b>distributor.</b> The current density improvements at the operating cell voltages 0. 6 V and 0. 3 V are 4. 96 % and 6. 45 %, respectively. Moreover, the species, temperature and current density are uniformly distributed because the reactants can also flow through the area covered by the ribs in the conventional design. It is concluded that a metal foam can be used as the <b>flow</b> <b>distributor</b> due to its high electrical conductivities and low weight advantages compared to the conventional graphite and metallic bipolar plates. In addition, the effects of permeability, operating pressure, operating temperature, and stoichiometry ratio on the cell performance were investigated.

40|$|Operational {{efficiency}} of multi-functional road construction machines depends on number of working bodies which are simultaneously performing technological operations. Systems for propulsion pto to the running equipment drive and active working bodies of road construction machines are developing {{in the way}} of using three-axis hydraulic drives. When designing a hydraulic system for road construction machinery dividing of power flow from propulsion to the running equipment drive and active working bodies is considered as rather essential problem. Leading companies do not pay attention to the development of flow divider designs, preferring to produce more expensive multi-flow pumps. One of the ways to increase {{efficiency of}} multi-functional road construction machinery is an implementation of running equipment hydraulic driving system based on a mono-aggregate pump unit which consists of a pump and a volumetric divider of power fluid flow. A principle of volumetric division and summing-up of power fluid flows, technical realization and methodology for calculation of key parameters of discrete <b>flow</b> <b>distributors</b> has been developed on the basis of discrete hydraulics regulations. The paper presents results of mathematical modeling of hydraulic systems equipped with the discrete <b>flow</b> <b>distributor.</b> Analysis of a dual-motor hydraulic drive operation has shown the following results: a discrete <b>flow</b> <b>distributor</b> ensures independent load mode of the current consumer circuit operation from the load mode of the second consumer circuit within a wide range of loads; rational value of working fluid flow discretization parameter is the following value interval  k  = 4 – 6, maximum value of parameter efficiency is reached when an angular velocity of a distributor rotor coincides with the angular velocity of a pump shaft; discrete <b>flow</b> <b>distributor</b> provides a possibility to change parameters of hydraulic flow feeding in consumers’ pressure lines within a wide range due to changes in geometrical parameters of the design; discrete <b>flow</b> <b>distributor</b> should be installed either close to the pump or be integrated into its design.

40|$|Various {{designs of}} chips for {{comprehensive}} two-dimensional spatial liquid chromatography were investigated. The performance of these chips was initially evaluated using {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD). A bifurcating distributor with an angle of 140 between branches was implemented {{in order to achieve}} a homogeneous velocity field. The cross-sectional area of the channels of the <b>flow</b> <b>distributor</b> was fixed at 0. 5 x 0. 5 mm, which allows a robust micromilling technique to be used for chip manufacturing. Experiments were performed with chips featuring purposely introduced imperfections {{in the structure of the}} bifurcating <b>flow</b> <b>distributor</b> to study its capacity of overcoming potential local clogging. Split peaks were observed when 75 % of one of the flow channels was obstructed, in line with the CFD predictions. The main bottlenecks for the performance of the spatial two-dimensional chips were identified, viz. sample injected in the first dimension diverging into the <b>flow</b> <b>distributor</b> and channel discretization (i. e., remixing of first-dimension separation peaks because of finite number of second-dimension channels). Solutions to the former problem were studied by applying a flow resistance in the vertical segments that formed the outlets of the <b>flow</b> <b>distributor</b> and by simulating the presence of constrictions. It was found that a flow resistance of 1. 0 x 10 (11) m(- 2) reduced the amount of sample diverging into the <b>flow</b> <b>distributor</b> by a factor of 10. The presence of a constriction of 90 % of the segment area and 50 % of the segment length decreased the diverging flow by a factor of 5. The influence of the linear velocity was significant.

The phosphorylated orange adsorption gel (POAG) is chemically modified orange waste which consisted of orange peels and pulps. Besides cotton, glass beads, and glass filter, POAG is also part of the reactor for both up-flow and <b>gravity</b> <b>flow</b> method. The wastewater treatment is run for 7 hours time of interval. The wastewater samples are taken from the automotive service and repair shop at Gambang. The concentration of heavy metals and oil and grease of the samples are measured for each hour. From the data analysis, the average percentage removals of Copper using <b>gravity</b> <b>flow</b> and up-flow method are 94. 12 % and 96. 57 % respectively. The average percentage removals of Lead using <b>gravity</b> <b>flow</b> and up-flow method are 162. 42 % and 188. 51 % respectively. The average percentage removals of Nickel using <b>gravity</b> <b>flow</b> and up-flow method are 126. 79 % and 139. 29 % respectively. The average percentage removals of Zinc using <b>gravity</b> <b>flow</b> and up-flow method are 88. 13 % and 88. 44 % respectively. The average percentage removals of oil and grease using <b>gravity</b> <b>flow</b> and up-flow method are 99. 02 % and 97. 61 % respectively.

40|$|Rugged {{bathymetry}} along slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges has {{the potential}} to impinge a strong control on <b>gravity</b> <b>flows</b> derived from oceanic fault scarps. Sedimentary lithofacies from the Macquarie Island ophiolite supports this hypothesis by displaying systematic variations that correspond with volcanic substrate differences and proximity to rift-related faults. Pillow-basalt terranes are associated with tightly confined bedrock corridors that funnel <b>gravity</b> <b>flows</b> into one direction. Vertical lithofacies variations formed from high-density to low-density turbidity currents record successive fill stages of the corridor axis. During initial stages tight confinement in the axis suppressed flow dilution and fluid turbulence. With continued corridor-axis filling, more dilute <b>gravity</b> <b>flows</b> predominated and formed lateral gradations from axial coarse-grained turbidites into thinly interbedded overbank lithofacies along corridor margins. These gravity-flow lithofacies converge into very thin muddy condensed intervals along inter-corridor highs where significant bottom-current reworking occurred. Conversely, partly confined tabular-basalt-floored basins promoted lateral expansion and dilution of <b>gravity</b> <b>flows</b> throughout the duration of basin filling. Variable paleocurrent-indicator directions record multiple reflections of single gravity-flow events off basin-bounding fault barriers. Coarsening-upward trends in these partly confined basins from thinly interbedded pelagic chert and ripple-bedded sandstones up into stacked turbidites preserves the ponding of sediment-starved submarine fans. In general, these ponded basins preserve the fine-grained distal ends of a gravity-flow continuum from coarse-grained fault-proximal en masse failures and cohesionless debris flows into medial high-density turbidity flows and distal dilute turbidity flows. 21 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This work aims {{to analyze}} the {{interaction}} between alongslope contouritic and downslope gravitational processes in the Alboran Sea. Recent results (Juan et al., 2012, 2016) demonstrated that the Pliocene and Quaternary stratigraphic architecture is mostly made up the vertical stacking of contourites interrupted by turbidite systems (TSs). The accurate analysis of all available seismic profiles has revealed several morpho-sedimentary signatures produced by {{the interaction of the}} Atlantic Water (AW) and Mediterranean waters (MWs) with the <b>gravity</b> <b>flows</b> in the Pliocene and Quaternary sedimentary record, {{as well as on the}} present-day seafloor. Different levels of interaction have been identified and they move between two-end-members: from bottom currents dominating <b>gravity</b> <b>flows,</b> to <b>gravity</b> <b>flows</b> dominating bottom currents. In between these extreme cases, a range of possibilities can occur. First, downslope and alongslope processes can alternate, with vertical and cyclic stacking of both types of deposit. Second, these processes can be balanced, allowing the simultaneous outbuilding of contourites and <b>gravity</b> <b>flow</b> deposits. Last, bottom currents can influence <b>gravity</b> <b>flows.</b> This last interaction is the most common in the Alboran Sea, resulting in the migration of the fan deposits in the direction of the dominant current, and also with effects on the architecture of the turbidite fans, and on their sedimentary composition (grain size). The different levels of interaction change in space and time. These changes have controlled the different depositional architecture displayed by the Spanish and Moroccan margins and the lateral changes along the Spanish margin as a consequence of the different architecture of the turbidite systems. Although interaction occurs in both margins, it is especially complex and varied on the Spanish margin, where the alongslope action is related to the AW, the light intermediate and the dense deep Mediterranean waters (LMw and DMw, respectively). This complex interaction has resulted in a depositional architecture that changes laterally as a consequence of the different architecture of the turbidite systems. Contrasting, on the Moroccan margin the alonsglope action is dominant, being mainly governed by the energy of the AW and the WMDW, that primarily inhibits the formation of canyons and related fan lobe deposits. This inhibition has been interpreted to be result of the topographical acceleration of the WMDW core that would favour an intense alongslope sediment transport, preventing deposition, avoiding the convergence of sediment, and thus inhibiting the formation of downslope <b>gravity</b> <b>flows...</b>|$|R
