Nevertheless, in locations with particularly good land or if it happened to have capable management, some kolkhozes accumulated substantial sums of money in their bank accounts. Subsequently, numerous kolkhozes were formally nationalized by changing their status to sovkhozes. The faint dividing lines between collective and state farms were obliterated almost totally in the late 1960s, when Khrushchev’s administration authorized a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>wage</b> to kolkhoz members, similarly to sovkhoz employees. Essentially, his administration recognized their status as hired hands rather than authentic cooperative members. The <b>guaranteed</b> <b>wage</b> provision was incorporated in the 1969 version of the Standard Charter.|$|R

5000|$|Explanation for {{the length}} of the compression's lasting have {{attributed}} to the lack of immigrant labor in the US during that time (immigrants often not being able to vote and so support their political interests) and the strength of unions, exemplified by Reuther's Treaty of Detroit—a landmark 1949 business-labor bargain struck between the United Auto Workers union and General Motors. Under that agreement, UAW members were <b>guaranteed</b> <b>wages</b> that rose with productivity, as well as health and retirement benefits. In return GM had relatively few strikes, slowdowns, etc. Unions helped limit increases in executive pay. Further, members of Congress in both political parties significantly overlapped in their voting records and relatively more politicians advocated centrist positions with a general acceptance of New Deal policies.|$|E

5000|$|Although Italian {{settlers}} and Australians had fairly harmonious relations {{through most of}} the nineteenth century, [...] "matters began to change once Italian workers and contadini (peasants) began arriving in greater numbers", as Rando observed. 1891 was the year in Queensland in which over 300 peasants from northern Italy were scheduled to arrive, as the first contingent to replace over 60,000 Kanakas brought to north Queensland since the mid-nineteenth century as exploitable labour for the sugarcane plantations. Until the early 1890s, Italians had been practically an unknown—although very modest—quantity in Queensland. As a result of the new White Australia policy, the Kanakas were now being deported. While employment was <b>guaranteed,</b> <b>wages</b> were low and fixed. The deciding factor in the whole matter was the plight of the sugar industry: docile gang labour was essential, and the 'frugal' Italian peasants were perfectly suited for such employment.|$|E

50|$|During World War II, Mexican and American governments {{developed}} an agreement {{known as the}} Bracero program, which allowed Mexican laborers {{to work in the}} United States under short-term contracts in exchange for stricter border security and the return of illegal Mexican immigrants to Mexico. Instead of providing military support to the U.S and its military allies, Mexico would provide laborers to the U.S. with the understanding that border security and illegal labor restrictions would be tightened by the United States. The United States agreed, based upon a strong need for cheap labor to support its agricultural businesses, while Mexico hoped to utilize the laborers returned from the United States to boost its efforts to industrialize, grow its economy, and eliminate labor shortages. The program began on September 27, 1942, when the first braceros were admitted into the United States under this agreement with Mexico. The program called for braceros to be <b>guaranteed</b> <b>wages,</b> housing, food, and exemption from military service, however these terms were often disregarded by American farm owners. After this agreement was reached, the Mexican government continued pressuring the United States to strengthen its border security or face the suspension of the legal stream of Mexican laborers entering the United States. Two million Mexican nationals participated in the program during its existence, but tensions between the program's stated and implicit goals, plus its ultimate ineffectiveness in limiting illegal immigration into the United States, eventually led to Operation Wetback in 1954.|$|E
40|$|Since {{the late}} 1900 s, the {{consultancy}} {{has taken a}} firm grip on the labor market. The consultants' work profile has been secured through agreements such as <b>guaranteed</b> <b>wages.</b> The collective has been shattered as well as higher demands are required of the employee. This results in higher work demands, workload, a reduced staffing resource and hopeless wages which can lead to health problems and depressions. Previous research shows that consultants find it stressful to be associated with two companies and some clients can also point out consultant through different attributes. With a qualitative approach I intend to examine the consultant’s background by structured interviews, observations and reading of secondary materials from the company. My results illustrate the requirements of the consultants work role which is supposed to be flexible, adaptable and show responsibility. With the assignment the consultant will take an emotional step away from the consultancy and will instead dissociate from creating relationships. Consultancies rapid recruitment process helps with consultants’ awareness of accessing symbols and norms at the workplace, which means that the consultant's organizational affiliation decreases. My advice is that Adecco will introduce new consultants of the company vision or have continuous workplace meetings. An improving of existing evaluation materials for consultants who are employed shorter than six months is needed. I believe that these work methods contribute to increase consultants’ organizational affiliation of the agency. Validerat; 20130701 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E

40|$|Minimum {{wages are}} {{generally}} {{thought to be}} unenforceable in developing rural economies. But there is one solution - a workfare scheme {{in which the government}} acts as the employer of last resort. Is this a cost-effective policy against poverty? Using a microeconometric model of the casual labor market in rural India, the authors find that a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>wage</b> rate sufficient for a typical poor family to reach the poverty line would bring the annual poverty rate down from 34 percent to 25 percent at a fiscal cost representing 3 - 4 percent of GDP when run for the whole year. Confining the scheme to the lean season (three months) would bring the annual poverty rate down to 31 percent at a cost of 1. 3 percent of GDP. While the gains from a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>wage</b> rate would be better targeted than a uniform (untargeted) cash transfer, the extra costs of the wage policy imply that it would have less impact on poverty.
