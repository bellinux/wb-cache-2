40|$|International audienceIn {{the context}} of global warming, {{reduction}} of carbon dioxide emissions in oil and gas processes is an environmental and financial issue for process design and comparison. Environmental impact of a system can be determined by life cycle assessment (LCA). However this method presents limitations.

The aim of this work is to build a correlation between CO 2 emissions and a thermodynamic quantity which depends on exergy. For the process under consideration, this correlation has the following asset: it enables CO 2 <b>emissions</b> <b>calculation</b> without performing an LCA, when operating conditions are modified.

The case studies are: improvement of an uncontrolled fill using Dynamic Compaction versus excavation, replacement and compaction in-place; installation of a driven pile foundation under a structural slab compared to the use of Controlled Modulus Columns under a slab-on-grade for a residential townhouse development; and the installation of a cement bentonite cut-off wall compared to a Soil-Bentonite wall. Each technology’s carbon footprint was analyzed using recognized carbon <b>emissions</b> <b>calculation</b> tools and values both for direct and indirect emissions. The authors have found that, in all cases, ground improvement technologies were not only more cost effective but also did significantly reduce the carbon footprint during the project construction phase; in two applications the reduction of carbon footprint {{was the result of the}} use of more ‘carbon-efficient ’ construction materials, such as slag/flyash mixes or even recycled materials from site; in the remaining case, engineering the exisiting fill by Dynamic Compaction simply proved to be a much better use of resources...|$|E

The model is evaluated by comparison between model predictions and traffic flow observations captured by inductive loop traffic detectors. The traffic flow outputs of LADTA are then coupled with COPERT model to calculate emissions of air pollutants(nitrogen oxides NOx for example). A sensitivity study is then carried out by varying the input parameters in the traffic emission modeling chain: the total traffic volume injected into the network, the average speed, the vehicle fleet composition, etc. The study shows that the emissions are very sensitive to these factors, especially during the transition from a free traffic network to a congested one...|$|E

40|$|Based on 15 {{production}} lines we surveyed in China, the widely accepted {{input and output}} methods were applied to compare the process emissions with CSI (Cement Sustainability Initiative), and IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) default values. We found that the output method would magnify CO 2 emissions from carbonate breakdown during clinker production. A reasonable method is to calculate carbonate content in raw meal using the CaO and MgO content in carbonate-containing material and their material ratio. Another finding is that the raw meals consumption recommended by CSI and CMBA (China Building Materials Academy) would enlarge and underestimate the calcining emissions, respectively. We applied the TC (total carbon) and LHV (lower heating value) methods for fuel <b>emissions</b> <b>calculation</b> and found {{that all of the}} samples' fuel emissions by the LHV method' were higher than those by the TC method. Indirect emissions from different cement producing stages were also estimated by using regional electricity emission factor. In raw meal preparation and cement grinding stage, there were no differences in main production technologies, but in clinker production stage a remarkable difference appears. Replacing carbonate-containing materials with non-carbonate materials and changing clinker ratio are the main ways to reduce CO 2 content in raw meal and process emissions. Lowering fossil fuel intensity, using clean energy and alternative fuel were strongly recommended for reducing cement energy emissions. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In {{developing}} countries, paratransit often meets essential mobility {{needs with}} older, inefficient vehicles that degrade air quality and emit greenhouse gases (GHGs). International climate change finance mechanisms {{such as the}} Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) or Green Climate Fund (GCF) could help fund cleaner vehicles. However, these mechanisms require generating a credible business‐as‐usual GHG baseline to compare against actual emissions. For paratransit, irregular scheduling and erratic driving behaviour add to a well‐documented list of factors that make the transaction costs prohibitively expensive for constructing robust transport baselines. This paper compares the relative accuracy and affordability of constructing five baselines for motorcycle taxis or ojeks in Bandung, Indonesia. The baselines that were constructed incorporate data that was gathered from one day and one week studies using revealed preference surveys as well as using real time global positioning systems (GPS) over one week into fuel efficiency and fuel consumption‐based <b>emissions</b> <b>calculation</b> techniques. The calculations show that the week‐long fuel consumption survey data generated the lowest fuel efficiency and highest GHG estimates. Driver survey data may therefore help construct a relatively low cost conservative baseline, especially when triangulated by GPS‐verified distance travelled data. The study concludes with several promising future research areas, including expanding the period of estimation for paratransit; examining the relationship between self‐reported distance and fuel consumption data; optimizing survey administration; and promoting climate finance mechanisms that engage stakeholders to lower the transaction costs of data gathering...|$|E
40|$|Indonesia {{is one of}} {{the highest}} {{greenhouse}} emitters in the world. As a response of this problem, Indonesia declared the national action plan to focus on national greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction by 26 % by 2020. To achieve this target, Government puts energy sector {{as one of the top}} priorities since it is the second strongest contributor to national GHG emissions. The main purpose of this paper is to apply the method of fugitive <b>emissions</b> <b>calculation</b> to the existing natural gas pipeline in Indonesia. Fugitive emissions are the major component of GHG emissions from natural gas systems and methane (CH 4), the primary component of natural gas pipeline, is a potent GHG. Tiered approaches from Interstate Natural Gas Association of America (INGAA) are implemented in this paper as the estimation guidelines. A case study of a natural gas pipeline system in Indonesia is analyzed to compare the GHG emissions level resulted from Tier 1 and Tier 2 methods. In these methods, the input data are pipeline length, the number of compressor stations, and the number of meter and pressure regulation stations. In this case, the GHG emissions level of Tier 2 is significantly different from Tier 1. The variation of pipeline length shows that for the length under 479. 2 miles, Tier 1 gives lower amount of CO 2 equivalent than Tier 2. The differences of these estimation methods and results can be furtherly developed to provide relevant information and recommendation for the Companies and Government to record the emissions level from natural gas transmission pipeline according to their needs and purposes...|$|E

Combinations of default and updated data are run through the NONROAD model in batch mode as a single scenario, rather than performing individual runs for each equipment category. The system is designed to provide great precision estimating construction equipment emissions, allowing for characterization of up to 24 construction sectors (e. g., highway, utility, etc.) Data are maintained in a MySQL 5. 0 database. MySQL queries automatically generate NONROAD 2005 input files, launches NONROAD in batch mode, and associated output files are imported back into the database for further processing. Adjustment factors are then applied, including county-level adjustments for altitude, soil and ground cover conditions, fuel parameters, as well as temperature and humidity corrections for NOx emissions.
