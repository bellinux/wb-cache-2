25|$|Scientists {{actively}} work {{to understand}} {{past and future}} climate by using observations and theoretical models. A climate record—extending deep into the Earth's past—has been assembled, {{and continues to be}} built up, based on geological evidence from borehole temperature profiles, cores removed from deep accumulations of ice, floral and faunal records, glacial and periglacial processes, stable-isotope and other analyses of sediment layers, and records of past sea levels. More recent <b>data</b> <b>are</b> <b>provided</b> by the instrumental record. General circulation models, based on the physical sciences, are often used in theoretical approaches to match past climate data, make future projections, and link causes and effects in climate change.|$|E

[...] Current and historical tax rate <b>data</b> <b>are</b> <b>provided.</b> [...] Tax rate data {{are also available}} for downloading to facilitate further study and analysis. [...] The sales tax rate data are particularly useful to taxpayers and voters in local sales tax elections. [...] Sales tax rate increases are being used more and more by local governments in California, especially cities, to fund government services, programs, infrastructure, and often high public employee salaries and benefits (including pension obligations). [...] As a result, there exists significant variation in sales tax rates in local jurisdictions throughout California with sales tax rates approaching or equal to 10% in many local jurisdictions. [...] Beginning July 1, 2017, the duties performed by the California State Board of Equalization relating to administration of the sales tax were transferred to the newly created California Department of Tax and Fee Administration.|$|E
