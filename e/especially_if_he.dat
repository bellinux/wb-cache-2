5|$|Diodorus {{says that}} the Egyptian fleet was sent to {{circumnavigate}} Salamis, and block the northern exit from the Straits. If Xerxes wanted to trap the Allies completely, this maneuver would have made sense (<b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was not expecting the Allies to fight). However, Herodotus does not mention this (and possibly alludes to the Egyptian presence in the main battle), leading some modern historians to dismiss it; though again, others accept it as a possibility. Xerxes had also positioned around 400 troops on the island known as Psyttaleia, {{in the middle of}} the exit from the straits, in order to kill or capture any Greeks who ended up there (as a result of shipwreck or grounding).|$|E
5|$|Yule {{asserts that}} the {{additional}} Fulin embassies during the Tang period arrived in 711 and 719 AD, with another in 742 AD {{that may have been}} Nestorian monks. Adshead lists four official diplomatic contacts with Fulin in the Old Book of Tang as occurring in 643, 667, 701, and 719 AD. He speculates that the absence of these missions in Western literary sources can be explained by how the Byzantines typically viewed political relations with powers of the East, as well as the possibility that they were launched on behalf of frontier officials instead of the central government. Yule and Adshead concur that a Fulin diplomatic mission occurred during the reign of Justinian II (r. 685–695 AD; 705–711 AD). Yule claims it occurred in the year of the emperor's death, 711 AD, whereas Adshead contends that it took place in 701 AD during the usurpation of Leontios and the emperor's exile in Crimea, perhaps the reason for its omission in Byzantine records and the source for confusion in Chinese histories about precisely who sent this embassy. Justinian II regained the throne with the aid of Bulgars and a marriage alliance with the Khazars. Adshead therefore believes a mission sent to Tang China would be consistent with Justinian II's behaviour, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had knowledge of the permission Empress Wu Zetian granted to Narsieh, son of Peroz III, to march against the Arabs in Central Asia {{at the end of the}} 7th century. The 719 AD Fulin embassy ostensibly came from Leo III the Isaurian (r. 717–741 AD) to the court of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (r. 712–756 AD), during a time when the Byzantine emperor was again reaching out to Eastern powers with a renewed Khazar marriage alliance. The year of this embassy coincided with Xuanzong's refusal to provide aid to the Sogdians of Bukhara and Samarkand against the Arab invasion force. An embassy from the Umayyad Caliphate was received by the Tang court in 732 AD; the Arab victory at the 751 AD Battle of Talas and the An Lushan Rebellion crippled Tang Chinese interventionist efforts in Central Asia.|$|E

25|$|When a court protects an applicant's {{substantive}} legitimate expectation, it {{is effectively}} mandating {{the outcome of}} a public body's decision-making process.

Nevertheless, it has been acknowledged that protecting substantive legitimate expectations ensures good administration.

By selling the option early in that situation, the trader can realise an immediate profit. Alternatively, he can exercise the option — for example, if there is no secondary market for the options — and then sell the stock, realising a profit. A trader would make a profit if the spot price of the shares rises by more than the premium. For example, if the exercise price is 100 and premium paid is 10, then if the spot price of 100 rises to only 110 the transaction is break-even; an increase in stock price above 110 produces a profit.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time since 1936-37 the Ashes were in dispute in the final Test of a series in Australia. Unfortunately the Fifth Test was to be played on the lifeless wicket at Sydney, though critics later pointed out that Norm O'Neill was able to play strokes, and that Neil Harvey, Ted Dexter and even Ken Barrington were able to play strokes on {{similarly}} lifeless wickets before in the series. Mindful of the Third Test three spinners were selected for the England team for {{the first time}} in an Ashes Test; Fred Titmus, Ray Illingworth and David Allen, along with Ken Barrington as a part-time leg-spinner. However, the opener Geoff Pullar was dropped due to an injured knee and Illingworth was brought in as a batsman more than a spinner and he bowled only 15 overs in the match and opened the second innings. Allen was distrusted by Dexter for all that he had been was England's first choice spinner and would take himself to the top of the England bowling averages as a result of this final Test. In any case it appeared that Dexter intended to catch Australia on a spinning wicket, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> batted first and caught them on the last day. Richie Benaud was the New South Wales captain and knew the Sydney Cricket Ground better than anyone, but his bowling options were limited. Alan Davidson had recovered from his thigh strain and Garth McKenzie was showing great promise, but the medium-fast seam bowler Neil Hawke was brought in to give them support and rest Davidson. Ken Mackay was dropped in his favour, which weakened the Australian batting, but they still had nine first-class centurions. This left Benaud as Australia's sole specialist spinner, with help from Bobby Simpson and perhaps Norm O'Neill. Peter Burge had made 163, 34 not out, 33 and 54 not out for South Australia in the Sheffield Shield and was brought back into the team at the expense of Barry Shepherd. Dexter won the toss for the second time at Sydney, which hadn't helped him in the Third Test, and decided to bat.|$|E
25|$|While {{returning}} to Spain, the Niña and Pinta encountered the roughest storm of their journey, and, {{on the night}} of 13 February, lost contact with each other. All hands on the Niña vowed, if they were spared, to make a pilgrimage to the nearest church of Our Lady wherever they first made land. On the morning of February 15, land was spotted. Columbus believed they were approaching the Azore Islands, but other members of the crew felt that they were considerably north of the islands. Columbus turned out to be right. On the night of February 17, the Niña laid anchor at Santa Maria Island, but the cable broke on sharp rocks, forcing Columbus to stay offshore until the morning, when a safer location was found to drop anchor nearby. A few sailors took a boat to the island, where they were told by several islanders of a still safer place to land, so the Niña moved once again. At this spot, Columbus took on board several islanders who had gathered onshore with food, and told them that his crew wished to come ashore to fulfill their vow. The islanders told him that a small shrine dedicated to Our Lady was nearby. Columbus sent half of the crew members to the island to fulfill their vow, but he {{and the rest of the}} crew stayed on the Niña, planning to send the other half to the island upon the return of the first crew members. While the first crew members were saying their prayers at the shrine, they were taken prisoner by the islanders, under orders from the island's captain, João de Castanheira, ostensibly out of fear that the men were pirates. The boat that the crew members had taken to the island was then commandeered by Castanheira, which he took with several armed men to the Niña, in an attempt to arrest Columbus. During a verbal battle across the bows of both craft, during which Columbus did not grant permission for him to come aboard, Castanheira announced that he did not believe or care who Columbus said that he was, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was indeed from Spain. Castanheira returned to the island. However, after another two days, Castanheira released the prisoners, having been unable to get confessions from them, and having been unable to capture his real target, Columbus. There are later claims that Columbus was also captured, but this is not backed up by Columbus's log book.|$|E

500|$|The {{stalemate}} at Thermopylae {{pointed the}} future {{direction of the}} ongoing conflict between Philip and the Athenians. Athens was a significant naval power, whilst Macedon had no real navy to speak of. Conversely, Macedon had a very powerful army, especially {{with the addition of}} the Thessalians after 352 BC, which Athens could not hope to match. The Athenians could therefore prevent Philip attacking Athens by sea, but not by land—unless they could occupy Thermopylae in time. The pass was narrow enough to make troop numbers irrelevant, and could only be bypassed with some difficulty, meaning the Athenians could hope to resist Philip there; Thermopylae therefore became the key position in the conflict. The Athenians also began to realise that they could not hope to reclaim Amphipolis, or defeat Philip, and must instead act on the defensive; as Demosthenes said: [...] "the war at the outset was concerned with taking revenge on Philip, now at its conclusion with not suffering at Philip's hands". From Philip's point of view, once he controlled Amphipolis, he could operate in the North Aegean unimpeded, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> campaigned during the Etesian winds, or in winter, when the Athenian navy could do little to stop him. However, he could not easily advance into Greece, to attack Athens for instance, if Thermopylae was held against him.|$|E

When Bradman returned at the end of the session he said he had played down on a yorker and to Ray Lindwall there was no doubt as to his sincerity. In the end the batsman was given the benefit of the doubt, but it had repercussions. Bradman recovered his form and hit 159 runs in 160 minutes before he was out for 187, which set up Australia's victory in the First Test by an innings and 332 runs. This was a morale-booster for a young team with eight debutants, but if Bradman had been out the Australian total would have been less, England would have batted on a flat wicket and the thunderstorm that wrecked the wicket would have caught Australia in their second innings.
