40|$|Macrofibers in {{steady-state}} {{growth at}} one temperature {{were subjected to}} pulses of various durations at a temperature at which the opposite helix hand would form {{and then returned to}} the initial temperature. In an upshift pulse (20 to 48 degrees C), at least 3 min of incubation was required to induce a transient inversion that occurred later after return to 20 degrees C. Longer pulses resulted in shorter delays in onset of the transient inversion. This "memory" of a brief high-temperature pulse suggests that even a small amount of material can influence the twist of the entire macrofiber. Similar results were found for temperature downshift pulses corresponding to the opposite inversion. Adding chloramphenicol during the temperature pulse blocked the establishment of memory associated with the right-to-left inversion but not that associated with left-to-right inversion. In contrast, inhibiting peptidoglycan synthesis with D-cycloserine during the temperature pulse did not prevent establishment of memory. Inhibiting protein synthesis in mutants fixed as left-handed structures over the entire temperature range induced conversion to right-handedness but did not affect mutants fixed as right-handed structures. Adding protease to either live or formaldehyde-killed macrofibers always induced rotations of right-handed orientation. Steady-state growth in the presence of protease was found to shift the <b>initial</b> macrofiber <b>twist</b> towards the right-hand end of the twist spectrum.

This paper explores the effect of <b>initial</b> <b>twist</b> on the static strength and fatigue life of studless chain. It reports test results for 16 mm studless chain (with similar proportions as the much larger chains now employed in hydrocarbon production vessels) with known levels of <b>initial</b> <b>twist</b> subject to axial tensile loading. Twist levels of up to 24 ° per link were examined. The results were generally better than had been expected. There was little scatter in the results, giving confidence in the test procedures. The effect of <b>initial</b> <b>twist</b> on static strength was modest, with a maximum strength loss of about 4 % at 18 ° twist per link. The effects of <b>initial</b> <b>twist</b> on fatigue life were also small. Indeed, some twist seemed to improve fatigue performance, perhaps because the contact between links was displaced from the region of high residual (compressive and tensile) stress resulting from proof loading during manufacture. While {{the results of these}} small scale tests suggest that twist levels up to 24 ° per link were not detrimental, other practical reasons remain for continuing to minimize twist in mooring chain.

40|$|We {{solve the}} force-free {{equation}} J x B = 0 for fields which are toroidally symmetric. The technique utilizes an expansion about a cylindrical field {{and is therefore}} valid or tori with a large aspect ratio such as long, thin, coronal loops. The calculation is performed in spatial toroidal coordinates, {{rather than in the}} flux coordinates used by previous authors; this allows direct calculation of the loci of flux surfaces and of surfaces of constant magnetic pressure. Our solutions differ significantly from toroidal fields in laboratories, which are in general not force-free. They are characterized by field lines whose projections in the poloidal planes are circles with centers displaced by varying distances from the axis of the torus. In general, flux surfaces do not correspond to surfaces of constant magnetic pressure. We have examined solutions corresponding to simple analytic zero-order cylindrical fields. For moderate twists in the zero-order (cylindrical) field, the magnetic pressure is larger on the inner toroidal radius. However, this effect diminishes with twist angle and in fact, for extreme <b>initial</b> <b>twists,</b> the magnetic pressure can be larger on the outer radius.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{algorithm}} for robotic kinematic calibration {{based on}} a minimal product of exponentials (POE) -based model for the applications where only position measurements are required. Both joint zero-offset errors and <b>initial</b> frame <b>twist</b> error can {{be involved in this}} model. Analysis of the identifiability of these errors shows that at most six elements of these parameters can be identified. It also suggests that at least three noncollinear points on the end-effector should be measured to maximize the identifiability. Compared with the traditional POE-based model with full pose (position and orientation) measurements, the minimal model with only position measurements outperforms in terms of convenience, efficiency, and accuracy. Note to Practitioners-Kinematic calibration is pivotal to improve the position accuracy of a robot. To avoid the disadvantages of measuring the orientation of the end-effector during calibration, an algorithm using only position measurements is presented, with which one needs only position measurements of several points fixed on the end-effector without orientation information during the whole calibration process. This will greatly facilitate the scheme design as well as the practical operations. The identifiability of the parameters is then analyzed with two conclusions: 1) at most six elements of the joint zero-offsets and the <b>initial</b> frame <b>twist</b> in total can be identified simultaneously and 2) at least three points on the end-effector which are not collinear should be measured so as to make the identifiability maximum.

40|$|We {{present a}} series of {{numerical}} experiments that model the evolution of magnetic flux tubes with a different amount of <b>initial</b> <b>twist.</b> As a result of calculations, tightly twisted tubes reveal a rapid two-step emergence to the atmosphere with a slight slowdown at the surface, while weakly twisted tubes show a slow two-step emergence waiting longer the secondary instability to be triggered. This picture of the two-step emergence is highly consistent with recent observations. These tubes show multiple magnetic domes above the surface, indicating that the secondary emergence is caused by interchange mode of magnetic buoyancy instability. As for the weakest twist case, the tube exhibits an elongated photospheric structure and never rises into the corona. The formation of the photospheric structure is due to inward magnetic tension force of the azimuthal field component of the rising flux tube (i. e., tube's twist). When the twist is weak, azimuthal field cannot hold the tube's coherency, and the tube extends laterally at the subadiabatic surface. In addition, we newly find that the total magnetic energy measured above the surface depends on the <b>initial</b> <b>twist.</b> Strong twist tubes follow the initial relation between the twist and the magnetic energy, while weak twist tubes deviates from this relation, because these tubes store their magnetic energy in the photospheric structures.

40|$|An {{analytic}} model {{was developed to}} study the extension-bend-twist coupling behavior of an advanced composite helicopter or tilt-rotor blade. The outer surface of the blade is defined by rotating an arbitrary cross section about an <b>initial</b> <b>twist</b> axis. The cross section can be nonhomogeneous and composed of generally anisotropic materials. The model is developed based upon a three dimensional elasticity approach that is recast as a coupled two-dimensional boundary value problem defined in a curvilinear coordinate system. Displacement solutions are written in terms of known functions that represent extension, bending, and twisting and unknown functions for local cross section deformations. The unknown local deformation functions are determined by applying the principle of minimum potential energy to the discretized two-dimensional cross section. This is an application of the Ritz method, where the trial function family is the displacement field associated with a finite element (8 -node isoparametric quadrilaterals) representation of the section. A computer program was written where the cross section is discretized into 8 -node quadrilateral subregions. Initially the program was verified using previously published results (both three-dimensional elasticity and technical beam theory) for pretwisted isotropic bars with an elliptical cross section. In addition, solid and thin-wall multi-cell NACA- 0012 airfoil sections were analyzed to illustrate the pronounced effects that pretwist, <b>initial</b> <b>twist</b> axis location, and spar location has on coupled behavior.
