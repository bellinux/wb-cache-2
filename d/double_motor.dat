50|$|Classes E 91 and E 77 {{were very}} similar. The three-axle driven bogies had an inside frame. Each had a <b>double</b> <b>motor</b> driving its axles via a {{jackshaft}} and Winterthur diagonal side-rod drive (Schrägstangenantrieb). The superstructure was in three sections. The {{front and rear}} sections each had a driver's cab and an engine room and were fixed to the bogies. The centre section was suspended between {{the front and rear}} sections and was articulated. The gangways between the individual sections of the engine room were protected by bellows; there were no dividing walls. The Bavarian locomotives could be easily told from their Silesian counterparts by the additional front door between the two cab windows (see photograph, right, of the Bavarian E 91 11, parked up in AW Frankfurt as a stationary transformer for the test shop. Unlike the E 91.9, it had air vents that can be clearly seen along {{the lower half of the}} sides).|$|E
50|$|The trams had two parallel-connected {{pantograph}}s, {{which were}} both used simultaneously. The back pantograph could be lowered by air pressure by the driver when the pantographs {{were used to}} control switches. During the 1950s, Oslo Sporveier started rebuilding the switches {{so that it was}} controlled by the tram, based on {{whether or not it was}} using power at a point. A-switches were made so the tram was to pass with power being drawn if the switch was to stay in the same place or go to the left, while B-switches would change if there was no power being drawn. Ekebergbanen's trailers were also equipped with pantographs, although these were only used to supply heating and lighting. However, both the <b>double</b> <b>motor</b> car pantographs and the trailer pantographs caused problems with the electrical switches, and were eventually discontinued in the city streets. All trailers from no. 1048 were delivered with a power cord to connect to the motor car, and some of the older trams were also rebuilt.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This study {{discussed}} {{configuration of}} driving system for improving power efficiency of {{hybrid electric vehicle}} driven by two motors connected in series with CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). In the system, the driving power was supplied by two motors in which one had large ability in power generation {{compared with that of}} another one. Algebraic simulation was executed to determine the shear ratio of the power by each motor with a simple model which referred information on the torque property curve of each motor. In the simulation, it was supposed that mechanical power was produced only by two motors but reciprocal engine in the system, in which the engine contributed to supply electric power to the motors. Nominal capabilities of motors used in this study were 10, 20, 30 kw, respectively. Two motors were selected among them in which total motor power was to be 30, 40, or 50 kw for the system in each condition. An effective parameter (Emt) was defined as the threshold of applied torque by sub-motor to determine the minimum condition where auxiliary power was supplied by the sub-motor beyond the condition. In the two motors system, the revolution speed of the sub-motor was controlled to be constant at 150 rad/s by the CVT with metal V-belt to maintain high efficiency of the sub-motor. Calculation results of current system were compared with that of traditional system driven by single motor. The difference of energy consumption was also calculated according to the difference of driven modes. In some conditions, energy consumption often decreased when double-motor system was applied. However, simply designed <b>double</b> <b>motor</b> system was not always effective to reduce the energy consumption to drive the vehicle. When the CVT was applied to <b>double</b> <b>motor</b> system, energy consumption was decreased compared with those by simply double and single motor system both for the acceleration up to low and high speed. Lowest energy consumption was observed on the <b>double</b> <b>motor</b> system controlled with CVT, when the 30 Nm of the (Emt) was set on the sub-motor. Improvement of 6 % in fuel consumption should be obtained in case of the “ 10 mode ” in which vehicles were often driven under low speed mode...|$|E

40|$|AbstractElastic {{conformational}} {{changes of}} the protein backbone are essential for catalytic activities of enzymes. To follow relative movements within the protein, Förster-type resonance energy transfer (FRET) between two specifically attached fluorophores can be applied. FRET provides a precise ruler between 3 and 8 nm with subnanometer resolution. Corresponding submillisecond time resolution is sufficient to identify conformational changes in FRET time trajectories. Analyzing single enzymes circumvents the need for synchronization of various conformations. FOF 1 -ATP synthase is a rotary <b>double</b> <b>motor</b> which catalyzes the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). A proton-driven 10 -stepped rotary FO motor in the Escherichia coli enzyme is connected to a 3 -stepped F 1 motor, where ATP is synthesized. To operate the <b>double</b> <b>motor</b> with a mismatch of step sizes smoothly, elastic deformations within the rotor parts have been proposed by W. Junge and coworkers. Here we extend a single-molecule FRET approach to observe both rotary motors simultaneously in individual FOF 1 -ATP synthases at work. We labeled this enzyme with two fluorophores specifically, that is, on the ε- and c-subunits of the two rotors. Alternating laser excitation was used to select the FRET-labeled enzymes. FRET changes indicated associated transient twisting within the rotors of single enzyme molecules during ATP hydrolysis and ATP synthesis. Supported by Monte Carlo simulations of the FRET experiments, these studies reveal that the rotor twisting is greater than 36 ° and is largely suppressed {{in the presence of}} the rotation inhibitor DCCD.

40|$|Retrograde {{transport}} of the fluorescent tracers Diamidino Yellow dihydrochloride and Fast Blue {{was used to}} determine the location of the spinal nucleus of the accessory nerve in the sheep. We also considered whether in this species the sternocephalic, brachiocephalic, omotransversarius and trapezius muscles, i. e. the muscles of the spinal accessory complex, are supplied by more than one population of motoneurons. The spinal accessory nucleus extends as a single column of neurons from C 1 to C 7 spinal cord segments and occupies a lateral position within the ventral horn. The most rostral portion of this column is located dorsolaterally, whereas the remaining portion from C 2 to C 7 occupies a ventrolateral position. At C 1 and C 4 levels the nucleus also possesses some cells with a medial location. All the muscles of the spinal accessory complex receive their motor innervation both from the spinal accessory nucleus and from motoneurons forming the cervical spinal nerves. A <b>double</b> <b>motor</b> innervation of these muscles is thus present in the sheep...|$|E
40|$|FoF 1 -ATP synthases in Escherichia coli (E. coli) {{bacteria}} are membrane-bound enzymes which use an internal proton-driven rotary <b>double</b> <b>motor</b> to catalyze {{the synthesis of}} adenosine triphosphate (ATP). According to the 'chemiosmotic hypothesis', a series of proton pumps generate the necessary pH difference plus an electric potential across the bacterial plasma membrane. These proton pumps are redox-coupled membrane enzymes which are possibly organized in supercomplexes, as shown for the related enzymes in the mitochondrial inner membrane. We report diffusion measurements of single fluorescent FoF 1 -ATP synthases in living E. coli by localization microscopy and single enzyme tracking to distinguish a monomeric enzyme from a supercomplex-associated form in the bacterial membrane. For quantitative mean square displacement (MSD) analysis, the limited size of the observation area in the membrane with a significant membrane curvature had to be considered. The E. coli cells had a diameter of about 500 nm and a length of about 2 to 3. Because the surface coordinate system yielded different localization precision, we applied a sliding observation window approach to obtain the diffusion coefficient D = 0. 072 2 /s of FoF 1 -ATP synthase in living E. coli cells.

40|$|Chronically {{implanted}} microwires {{were used}} to deliver brief trains of electrical stimuli (11 cathodal pulses at 330 Hz and intensity 5 - 35 microA) to sixty-two locations in the grey matter of the pericruciate cortex in cats. Electromyographic (e. m. g.) responses in the contralateral forelimb were recorded from a total of ten muscles (four to eight in each animal) acting about the shoulder, elbow and wrist and on the digits. The animals were relaxed with little background e. m. g. in the muscles {{and as a result}} only excitatory effects could be described. Five muscles which are flexors in the locomotor context were excited from more electrodes, distributed more widely across the motor cortex, than another five muscles which are extensors during locomotion; this difference in 'accessibility' was present both at 35 microA stimulus intensity and at 15 microA. At a stimulus intensity of 15 microA, effective cortical electrodes tended to cluster either in the most lateral part of the anterior sigmoid gyrus (rostromedial focus) or in the coronal gyrus just caudal to a line prolonged beyond the lateral end of the cruciate sulcus (caudolateral focus). This is consistent with the existence of a <b>double</b> <b>motor</b> representation within the forelimb motor cortex (Pappas & Strick, 1981). The two foci were similar in that both gave rise to more flexor than extensor responses and to fewer responses in digit or wrist muscles than in muscles acting about more proximal joints (elbow and shoulder). At stimulus intensity 35 microA the latency of the earliest e. m. g. responses ranged from 11 to 14 ms in different muscles. For some muscles and electrodes the amplitude of the e. m. g. responses was substantially altered by a quite small postural change. After pyramidectomy the cortical thresholds and the e. m. g. latencies were both greatly increased...|$|E
40|$|A <b>double</b> <b>motor</b> {{innervation}} {{has been}} shown for several muscles of marine crustaceans. The adductors of the claws of Randallia and Blepharipoda and the adductor of the dactylopodite of the walking leg of Cancer were studied physiologically. The two motor axons which innervate these muscles have a different diameter (ratio 1. 4 : 1). Stimulation of the thick fibre causes a response, which, {{though it is not}} always faster than the response of the thin fibre, must be considered as a "fast" contraction. In Randallia and in Blepharipoda the slow contraction is higher than the fast with frequencies of less than ± 50 per sec., in Cancer with frequencies less than 100 per sec. The action currents of the two kinds of contraction are different. Both show facilitation, but under the same conditions of stimulation the fast-action currents are higher. The first stimulus of the thick fibre causes an action current top which is clearly distinguishable, the action currents of the slow contraction show up only after a number of stimuli. Even when the mechanical reaction on stimulation of the thick fibre is smaller than on similar stimulation of the thin fibre, the action currents are higher in the first case. A single impulse in the thick fibre does not cause a contraction, but sets up a muscle-action current. The chronaxie of this action current in Blepharipoda and Randallia is 0. 8 sigma and is about the same as that found for the action current of the nerve. Two impulses in the thick fibre may cause a mechanical response, as is shown by summation experiments. The pseudo-chronaxie of this contraction was measured as 3. 5 sigma. The second action current shows facilitation, when it follows the first within 1 sec.; a mechanical reaction results with summation intervals of two stimuli of less than 10 sigma. The facilitation of the action current increases with decrease of the time interval between the two impulses; with the shortest intervals that give summation the resulting action current is a smooth high spike...|$|E
