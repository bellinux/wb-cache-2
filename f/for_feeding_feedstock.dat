40|$|The demand <b>for</b> food, <b>feed,</b> and <b>feedstocks</b> <b>for</b> {{bioenergy}} and biofactory {{plants will}} increase proportionally due to population growth, prosperity, and bioeconomic growth. Securing food supply and meeting demand for biomass will involve many biological and agro-ecological aspects such as genetic plant improvement, sustainable land use, water-saving irrigation, and integrated nutrient management {{as well as}} control of pests, diseases and weeds. It {{will be necessary to}} raise biomass production and economic yield per unit of land—not only under optimum growing conditions, but even more under conditions constrained by climate, water availability, and soil quality. Most of the advanced agronomic research by national and international research institutes is dedicated to the major food crops: maize, rice, wheat, and potato. However, research on crops grown as feedstock, for bio-energy and industrial use under conditions with biophysical constraints, is lagging behind. Global and regional assessments of the potential for growing crops are mostly based on model and explorative studies under optimum conditions, or with either water or nitrogen deficiencies. More investments in combined experimental and modeling research are needed to develop and evaluate new crops and cropping systems under a wide range of agro-ecological conditions. An integral assessment of the biophysical production capacity and the impact on resource use, biodiversity and socio-economic factors should be carried out before launching large-scale crop production systems in marginal environments...|$|R
40|$|The {{two-dimensional}} {{distributions of}} spectral radiation intensities in the plasma torch were observed for the pulse modulated induction thermal plasmas (PMITP) with {{continuous or intermittent}} <b>feedstock</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>for</b> TiO 2 nanopowder synthesis. For this observation, an imaging spectrophotometer with a high speed video camera were adopted. The evaporation of feedstock Ti powder, the formation of TiO and TiO transportation were investigated from the observation results of a Ti atomic spectral line and TiO molecule spectra {{as well as those}} of Ar and O atomic lines. An interpretation was suggested from the observation results for Ti feedstock evaporation and TiO formation in nanoparticle synthesis using a PMITP with intermittent <b>feedstock</b> <b>feeding...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to clarify changes in rice {{planting}} and regional features of rice <b>for</b> <b>feed</b> production in Hokkaido. The study approach employed two analyses. First, by using statistical data, the changes in crop acreage of paddy rice were determined. Second, surveys of rice farmers showed details of the planting practices <b>for</b> rice <b>for</b> <b>feed</b> production. The following conclusions were obtained: (1) There are increasing regional disparities in the “production control policy” and rice <b>for</b> <b>feed</b> production. (2) Expansion of production of rice <b>for</b> <b>feed</b> is affected by local agriculture promotion policies. It is concluded that production of rice <b>for</b> <b>feed</b> contributes to maintenance of the rice acreage...|$|R
