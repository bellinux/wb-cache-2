5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, Wye Road {{followed}} the alignment of present-day 76Avenue out of Edmonton to the east, <b>enroute</b> to North Cooking Lake. By the 1920s {{it had become}} a secondary unsurfaced thoroughfare, and was later named Highway 14. As Edmonton and the newly developed Sherwood Park grew in the late 1960s, a free-flowing road, Sherwood Park Freeway, was built to link the two on a new alignment of Highway14 several hundred meters north of Wye Road. The cloverleaf interchange at the freeway's east end was completed in 1965, and the remaining interchanges were completed in 1968. It was four lanes wide and included an additional interchange immediately east of 17Street that has since been removed. After completion of Sherwood Park Freeway, the existing Highway14 (76Avenue) was renamed to Highway14A. Further south, Whitemud Drive was constructed and eventually extended east to reach Highway14. It then assumed the designation of Highway14 to a new terminus at Calgary Trail. The Highway14A designation has since been removed from 76Avenue, and the portion of Sherwood Park Freeway within Strathcona County was eventually renumbered Highway100.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Air Canada {{encountered}} financial difficulties as {{the airline industry}} slumped {{in the aftermath of}} the Persian Gulf War. In response, the airline restructured management by hiring former Delta Air Lines executive Hollis L. Harris as its CEO. Harris restructured the airline's operations, reduced management positions, moved the corporate headquarters to Dorval Airport, and sold the <b>enRoute</b> card business to Diners Club in 1992. By 1994, Air Canada had returned to profitability. The same year also saw the carrier winning route access to fly from Canada to the new Kansai Airport in Osaka, Japan.|$|E
25|$|Phase Three was to {{take place}} very shortly after, if not during, Phase Two. It was to extort several million dollars from the United States government. This money {{would be used to}} finance a larger plan to travel north into Canada, {{stopping}} <b>enroute</b> at YMCAs and orphanages recruiting other impressionable young boys with no parents or guidance. Muhammad thought he could act as their father figure as he did with Lee Boyd Malvo. Once he recruited a large number of young boys and had arrived in Canada, he would begin their training. Malvo described how Muhammad allegedly intended to train the youths with weapons. After their training was complete, Muhammad would send them out across the United States to carry out mass shootings in many different cities, just as he had done in Washington, D.C. and Baltimore.|$|E
25|$|After the <b>enroute</b> {{navigation}} {{test flight}} was completed, the AAIB's test pilot flew several approaches to Campbeltown Airport {{with the same}} aircraft while investigators monitored its position on the radar equipment that was used {{the night of the}} accident. When the test aircraft flew the approach as indicated on the navigation chart that was found clipped to the pilot's control wheel, there was a small gap in radar coverage when the aircraft was at its most distant point from the airport, beginning at 10.1nm and ending on the return segment at 9.4nm from the MAC VOR. Other trials were conducted at lower altitudes, and in those trials the coverage gap was widened considerably. Investigators tried approaches at low and descending altitudes involving a steeper left turn to 157° (where the heading bug was set on the HSI), and then flying that heading until intercepting the correct course to the MAC VOR. When this track was flown at 1,400 feet, the last radar contact was at 7.9nm from the MAC VOR. The last radar contact with the accident flight was at 8.1nm from the MAC VOR, at an altitude of 1,340 feet. Flying this track with the accident flight's known and projected descent profile brought the test aircraft to within 0.2nm of the crash site at an altitude of 200 feet, which was within the margin of error for the differences in wind {{on the day of the}} accident and on the day of the test flight.|$|E

500|$|On July 25, 1960, Hemingway and Mary left Cuba, {{never to}} return. During {{the summer of}} 1960, {{he set up a}} small office in his New York City {{apartment}} and attempted to work. He left New York City for good soon after. He then traveled alone to Spain to be photographed for the front cover for the Life magazine piece. A few days later, he was reported in the news to be seriously ill and on the verge of dying, which panicked Mary until she received a cable from him telling her, [...] "Reports false. <b>Enroute</b> Madrid. Love Papa." [...] However, he was seriously ill and believed himself {{to be on the verge}} of a breakdown. He was lonely and took to his bed for days, retreating into silence, despite having had the first installments of The Dangerous Summer published in Life in September 1960 to good reviews. In October, he left Spain for New York, where he refused to leave Mary's apartment on the pretext that he was being watched. She quickly took him to Idaho, where George Saviers (a Sun Valley physician) met them at the train.|$|E
500|$|The {{military}} orders {{such as the}} Knights Hospitaller and the Knights Templar provided Latin Christendom's {{first professional}} armies {{in support of the}} Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem and the other Crusader states. [...] The Poor Knights of Christ (Templars) and their Temple of Solomon were founded around 1119 by a small band of knights who dedicated themselves to protecting pilgrims <b>enroute</b> to Jerusalem. The Hospitallers and the Templars became supranational organisations as Papal support led to rich donations of land and revenue across Europe. This in turn led to a steady flow of new recruits and the wealth to maintain multiple fortifications across the Outremer. In time, this developed into autonomous power in the region. After the fall of Acre the Hospitallers first relocated to Cyprus, then conquered and ruled Rhodes (1309–1522) and Malta (1530–1798), and continue in existence to the present day. Philip IV of France probably had financial and political reasons to oppose the Knights Templar, which led to him exerting pressure on Pope Clement V. The Pope responded in 1312, with a series of papal bulls including Vox in excelso and Ad providam that dissolved the order on the alleged and probably false grounds of sodomy, magic, and heresy.|$|E

2500|$|Morgan's {{intellectual}} {{experience in}} the federal WPA programs had both advantages and disadvantages {{for him as a}} historian. The independent nature of these programs encouraged his critical judgment and work ethic, forced him to work with a variety of people, and exposed him to a wide training ground on source development and research. However, it did not lead him to consider the larger meaning of the facts he gathered or to understand the philosophy and theory of history, as taught in an academic setting. In fact, during the trials of his career, he became quite antagonistic to academic requirements. In response to a negative academic review of a work by his friend DeVoto, he wrote: [...] "...the term ‘history’ had better be redefined to mean, ’a species of writing produced by or <b>enroute</b> to a Ph.D.’ I have had enough troubles trying to break a path alongside this main-traveled road to know something of the snobberies at work here, {{and the ways in which}} the academic world and even the world of learning are geared to these attitudes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Granville and James, {{along with}} nine other travelers, were <b>enroute</b> east when Granville fell seriously ill in {{southern}} Idaho. [...] Granville was {{too ill to}} travel so James stayed with him while the others went east. By the time Granville recovered, {{it was too late}} in the year to continue east over the Rocky Mountains. [...] The brothers could not winter over in southern Idaho nor could they seek refuge in Salt Lake City because of the ongoing conflict between the United States and the Mormons called the Mormon War. Instead they befriended a former fur trapper Jake Meek who wintered a small cattle herd in the Beaverhead Valley. [...] On October 10, 1857, Granville and James Stuart and Jake Meek crossed Monida Pass 200 miles north into the Beaverhead Valley and what was to become Montana Territory in 1864. [...] They established a camp along the Beaverhead River near present-day Dillon, Montana. Others were already in the valley. [...] Many former fur traders had adopted the practice trading one good cow or oxen for two trail weary animals on the Oregon Trail during the summer. [...] They overwintered the animals in the Beaverhead to get them healthy for the next summer. One of these traders was French-Canadian Richard Grant, father of Johnny Grant who established the Grant Ranch in Deer Lodge in 1862.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{failed to}} keep the {{immigrant}} subsidiaries, Sitmar decided to convert their recently acquired ships for cruise service instead. [...] The Fairwind received a year-long refit between January 1970 and January 1971, after which she joined her sister (completed some two months earlier and renamed Fairsea) on the North American cruise market, on which she proved highly popular. During the northern hemisphere winter season the Fairwind made cruises to South America from Fort Lauderdale, while during the summer season she sailed from San Francisco on cruises to Canada and Alaska. In the late 1980s Sitmar decided to change their brand identity with a new external livery and new naming policy. Following an impact with a sandbar during an Amazon cruise in 1988, the Fairwind sailed through the Panama Canal <b>enroute</b> to Los Angeles. After disembarking the passengers the ship headed for San Fransisco where it received repairs to its propeller and a facelift. The Fairwind became the first ship to be re-painted and -named, becoming the blue-funnelled Sitmar Fairwind in 1988. Her career as the Sitmar Fairwind proved short, as already on 1 September 1988 Sitmar Cruises was sold to P Group, who decided to close down the Sitmar brand in North America. Just eight days after the acquisition of Sitmar by P, Sitmar Fairwind was renamed Dawn Princess and transferred to the fleet of Princess Cruises.|$|E
