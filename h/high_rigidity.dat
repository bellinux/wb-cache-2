Because beryllium is expensive (many times more than titanium), hard to shape due to its brittleness, and toxic if mishandled, beryllium tweeters are limited to high-end home, pro audio, and public address applications.

5|$|Beryllium mirrors are of {{particular}} interest. Large-area mirrors, frequently with a honeycomb support structure, are used, for example, in meteorological satellites where low weight and long-term dimensional stability are critical. Smaller beryllium mirrors are used in optical guidance systems and in fire-control systems, e.g. in the German-made Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 main battle tanks. In these systems, very rapid movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and <b>high</b> <b>rigidity.</b> Usually the beryllium mirror is coated with hard electroless nickel plating which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium. In some applications, though, the beryllium blank is polished without any coating. This is particularly applicable to cryogenic operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the coating to buckle.|$|E
500|$|Asus {{designed}} the Zenbooks with brushed aluminium chassis and <b>high</b> <b>rigidity,</b> rather than plastic, the usual laptop construction material. A pattern of concentric circles on the lids {{is said to}} represent ripples in water and represent the [...] "zen philosophy" [...] that designers wanted to portray when creating the laptops. Zenbooks have been generally well received due to their chassis design and appearance {{as well as the}} high quality screens used in later models. However, the touchpad software was found to be erratic, particularly on the early models [...] and some of the models received criticism for their high prices. Some models (such as the UX32) suffer from lockdown when the lithium polymer battery cell gets drained or discharged below its recommended threshold, for example if the device is left on and unattended. The result is that the charger will fail to recharge the battery even when plugged in, leaving the machine in a near-complete unresponsive off-state. The machine can often be revived by pressing the power-on key for 10 seconds, whereupon it will start recharging.|$|E

2500|$|The 2004 model S2000 {{underwent}} several significant changes. Production {{moved to}} Suzuka.

The spring rates and shock absorber damping were altered and the suspension geometry modified to improve stability by reducing toe-in changes under cornering loads. The subframe also received a revision in design to achieve a <b>high</b> <b>rigidity.</b> In the gearbox the brass synchronizers were replaced with carbon fiber. In addition, cosmetic changes {{were made to the}} exterior with new front and rear bumpers, revised headlight assemblies, new LED tail-lights, and oval-tipped exhausts.

30|$|The {{predictions}} of labour market theories do not all {{point in the}} same direction regarding the degree of rigidity for natives and immigrants (see (Campbell and Kamlani 1997) {{for a discussion of the}} alternative theories on wage rigidity). According to the insider-outsider theory (Lindbeck and Snower 1988), insiders have more power to influence the wage-setting process and tend to have <b>higher</b> wage <b>rigidity.</b> As native workers tend to have more bargaining power, this suggests that they could have more rigid wages. Furthermore, in Portugal the share of immigrants with permanent contracts is much smaller than the share of natives. So, the contract theory (Taylor 1979) also suggests that native workers would have <b>higher</b> wage <b>rigidity.</b> The adverse selection model applied to quits predicts that the most productive workers are most likely to quit after a wage cut. So, firms would be less likely to cut wages of the more-skilled and/or more-tenured workers. In addition, firms are more willing to retain workers with more firm-specific human capital which also implies a <b>higher</b> <b>rigidity</b> of wages of workers with higher tenure. Given the recent nature of most immigrant flows in Portugal, these theories suggest a <b>higher</b> wage <b>rigidity</b> for natives.|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects of {{monetary}} policy on the equity premium and the cross-section of stock returns in a general equilibrium framework. Monetary policy is conducted using an interest-rate policy rule reacting to inflation and output. Product-price rigidities in the production sector generate an equity premium {{that depends on the}} policy. The model predicts that (i) industries with lower price <b>rigidities</b> earn <b>higher</b> expected returns than industries with <b>higher</b> price <b>rigidities</b> and (ii) the difference in expected returns declines with more aggressive monetary policies. We provide an explanation for these results based on countercyclical markups. Markups of industries with low price rigidities are less variable than markups of industries with <b>high</b> price <b>rigidities.</b> When the marginal utility of consumption is high, markups in industries with <b>high</b> <b>rigidities</b> increase by more than markups in industries with low rigidities. As a result, profits of industries with low rigidities are more sensitive to policy shocks, and investors require a higher compensation for holding stocks on these industries. When the response of monetary policy to inflation is more aggressive, the markup variability reduces, and the difference in expected returns between <b>high</b> and low <b>rigidity</b> industries decreases. We find empirical evidence supporting the model’s predictions...|$|R
