50|$|GSFMO {{implemented}} the official procurement program, purchasing locally produced wheat and barley at guaranteed prices for domestic sales and exports. The procurement price was steadily reduced during the 1980s because of massive overproduction and for budgetary reasons, {{but it was}} substantially higher than international prices. By the late 1980s, the procurement price for wheat, for example, was three times the international price. Although quantity restrictions were implemented to limit procurement, pressures from a growing farm lobby led to ceiling-price waivers. Moreover, the government encountered considerable fraud with imports being passed off as domestic production. To control this situation, the government has granted import monopolies for some agricultural products to the GSFMO, while procurement and <b>import</b> <b>subsidies</b> on certain crops have been shifted to encourage a more diversified production program.

The paper developed and statistically estimated an import demand function for sugar with the aim of providing quantitative estimates of the response of imports to the changing government policies. The results show that the factors which significantly affect sugar imports are: (1) the traditional non-policy variables: deflated imported price of sugar, and real income per capita. (2) the policy variables: deflated <b>import</b> <b>subsidy,</b> and year-ending stock. The estimated elasticities of deflated imported price, real income per capita, deflated <b>import</b> <b>subsidy,</b> and the ending stock are: - 0. 94, 1. 30, 0. 10, and - 0. 31 respectively. Results of the simulation assuming a 30 % increase in international price of sugar show that annual quantity of imported sugar in the 1991 - 1995 period will be 408578, 317712, 388722, 412896, 451686 ton, respectively.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of preferential trade liberalization {{over the last}} 20 years has {{raised the question of}} whether it slows down multilateral trade liberalization. Recent theoretical and empirical evidence indicates this is the case even for unilateral preferences that developed countries provide to small and poor countries but there is no estimate of the resulting welfare costs. To avoid this stumbling block effect we suggest replacing unilateral preferences by a fixed <b>import</b> <b>subsidy.</b> We argue that this scheme would reduce the drag of preferences on multilateral liberalization and generate a Pareto improvement. More importantly, we provide the first estimates of the welfare cost of preferential liberalization as a stumbling block to multilateral liberalization. By combining recent estimates of the stumbling block effect of preferences with data for 170 countries and over 5, 000 products we calculate the welfare effects of the United States, European Union and Japan switching from unilateral preferences to Least Developed Countries to the <b>import</b> <b>subsidy</b> scheme. Even in a model with no dynamic gains to trade we find that the switch produces an annual net welfare gain for the 170 countries ($ 4, 354 million) and for each group: the United States, European Union and Japan ($ 2, 934 million), Least Developed Countries ($ 520 million) {{and the rest of the}} world ($ 900 million) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} quantitative {{estimates of}} the impact of removing agricultural support (both tariffs and subsidies) in partial- and general-equilibrium frameworks. The results show that agricultural support in industrial countries is highly distortionary and tariffs have a larger distortionary impact than subsidies. Removal of agricultural support would likely raise the international prices of food, resulting in an increase in the cost of food for many net-food- importing countries, although the increase is generally small. The results also show that most of the benefits from removing agricultural support accrue to the countries that liberalize.

40|$|World Bank, This paper {{examines}} {{the problems of}} Russia’s post-communist economic transformation. Its main thesis is that the Russian attempt at radical economic reform largely failed, because of extraordinary rent-seeking by old enterprise managers through export rents, subsidized credits, <b>import</b> <b>subsidies</b> and direct government subsidies, while they gained little from privatization. The reason why the managers were so strong was that the Soviet Union left large economic distortions behind and a virtually unconstrained economic elite. The reforms could have been reinforced if democratic institutions had been developed faster, or if the West had provided financial support for the reforms in early 1992. Over time, rents have dwindled, but Russian institutions have been seriously damaged by corruption. Intense competition over rents contributed to the financial crash in August 1998, but the competition also limits the rents, and might ease the way for future reforms. 2 During the last decade, Russia’s GDP has fallen by about 40 percent, and GDP is likely to fall by several percent in 1999.

Developing and transitional country governments have a need to protect their farmers (and, often, consumers) against external shocks, particular arising from world market price swings. Typically lacking fiscal resources, their only feasible approach to do this may be through the use of border measures to moderate price transmission to the domestic market.

40|$|The {{substantial}} {{reform in}} the rules governing agricultural trade including the introduction of tariff bindings which set an upper bound on future protection, is a major step tbrward which can be credited to the Uruguay Round agreement. However, the extent of intended liberaiization was eroded because the tariff equivalents in major OECD countries were set at levels {{significantly higher than the}} border protection they replaced in the base period. Even after the tariff reductions scheduled in the Round, the ad-valorem tariff bindings in major commodities in several countries will remain higher than the rate of protection during 1982 - 93. This results in levels of protection potentially higher than historicai levels. In developing countries, the reductions in border protection will also be modest at best, since most countries chose to bind their tariffs at a maximum level or to reduce already bound rates, which nevertheless remained higher than current applied rates.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the empirical {{validity of the}} median voter theory of trade policy. Mayer’s classic framework predicts that the optimal tariff is positive for a capital-abundant country and negative for a labor-abundant country (Mayer, 1984). However, <b>import</b> <b>subsidies</b> are rare so the tariff level prediction seems unrealistic. In this paper we examine two approaches to reconcile the theory {{with the lack of}} “pro-trade” bias across countries. First, we test the variation inequality-tariff prediction proposed by Dutt and Mitra (2002). We find support for it using human capital during the 1980 s and 1990 s. Using physical capital, the prediction is validated for the 1990 s but not for the 1980 s. Second, we extend the Mayer framework to a large country. The tariff level in a large country is the sum of the median voter component and a positive terms of trade component. We provide empirical evidence for this level prediction and a positive terms of trade component in the 1990 s. Using human capital, we find that the median voter component is positive in capital-abundant countries and negative in labor-abundant countries. Consequently, positive terms of trade effects can overcome the median voter component in labor-abundant countries, reconciling theory with observed protectionism. ...|$|E
40|$|In poor countries, most governments {{implement}} policies {{aiming to}} stabilize the prices of staple foods, which often include storage and trade measures insulating their domestic market from the world market. It is of crucial importance to understand the precise motivations and efficiency of those interventions, because they can have consequences worldwide. This paper addresses those issues by analyzing {{the case of a}} small, open developing country confronted by shocks to both the crop yield and foreign price. In this model, government interventions may be justified by the lack of an insurance market for food prices. Considering this market imperfection, the authors design optimal public interventions through trade and storage policies. They show that an optimal trade policy largely consists of subsidizing imports and taxing exports, which benefits consumers at the expense of producers. <b>Import</b> <b>subsidies</b> alleviate the non-negativity of food storage. In other words, when stocks are exhausted, subsidizing imports prevents domestic price spikes. One striking result: an optimal storage policy on its own is detrimental to consumers, since its stabilizing benefits leak into the world market and it raises the average domestic price. By contrast, an optimal combination of storage and trade policies results in a powerful stabilizing effect for domestic food prices.
