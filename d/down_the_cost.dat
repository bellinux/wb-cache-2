25|$|Network {{capacity}} – According to Gerry/Gerald Butters, {{the former}} head of Lucent's Optical Networking Group at Bell Labs, there is another version, called Butters' Law of Photonics, a formulation that deliberately parallels Moore's law. Butters' law says that the amount of data coming out of an optical fiber is doubling every nine months. Thus, the cost of transmitting a bit over an optical network decreases by half every nine months. The availability of wavelength-division multiplexing (sometimes called WDM) increased the capacity that could be placed on a single fiber by as much as a factor of 100. Optical networking and dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) is rapidly bringing <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of networking, and further progress seems assured. As a result, the wholesale price of data traffic collapsed in the dot-com bubble. Nielsen's Law says that the bandwidth available to users increases by 50% annually.|$|E
25|$|Detached eddy {{simulations}} (DES) is {{a modification}} of a RANS model in which the model switches to a subgrid scale formulation in regions fine enough for LES calculations. Regions near solid boundaries and where the turbulent length scale {{is less than the}} maximum grid dimension are assigned the RANS mode of solution. As the turbulent length scale exceeds the grid dimension, the regions are solved using the LES mode. Therefore, the grid resolution for DES is not as demanding as pure LES, thereby considerably cutting <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of the computation. Though DES was initially formulated for the Spalart-Allmaras model (Spalart et al., 1997), it can be implemented with other RANS models (Strelets, 2001), by appropriately modifying the length scale which is explicitly or implicitly involved in the RANS model. So while Spalart–Allmaras model based DES acts as LES with a wall model, DES based on other models (like two equation models) behave as a hybrid RANS-LES model. Grid generation is more complicated than for a simple RANS or LES case due to the RANS-LES switch. DES is a non-zonal approach and provides a single smooth velocity field across the RANS and the LES regions of the solutions.|$|E
40|$|Crystalline silicon {{solar cells}} have {{dominated}} the photovoltaic market since the very beginning in the 1950 s. Silicon is nontoxic and abundantly available in the earth's crust, and silicon PV modules have shown their long-term stability over decades in practice. The reduction {{in the price of}} silicon modules in the last 30 years can be described very well by a learning factor of 20 %, that is, doubling the cumulated module capacity results in a reduction of module prices by 20 %. Production has exploded in the last few years, reaching a new record value of more than 20 GWp in 2010. To extend the success story of this photovoltaic working horse, it is important to further bring <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs.</b> <b>The</b> <b>cost</b> distribution of a crystalline silicon PV module is clearly dominated by material <b>costs,</b> especially by <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of <b>the</b> silicon wafer.

25|$|The García {{government}} {{reacted to}} the growing external deficit {{in exactly the same}} way as had the governments of Velasco and of Belaúnde—by postponing corrective action while the problem continued to worsen. As ever, a major fear was that devaluation would worsen inflation. Inflationary pressures were, in fact, beginning to worsen behind the façade of control. To some degree, they were growing in response to the high rate of growth of demand and output, reducing margins of previously underutilized productive capacity. But the more explosive pressures were being built up by relying on price controls that required a dramatic expansion of credit to keep the system in place. Prices of public sector services—gasoline above all, oil products in general, electricity, telephones, and postal services—were frozen at levels that soon became almost ridiculous in real terms. The restrictions on prices charged by state firms drove them ever deeper into deficits that had to be financed by borrowing. The borrowing came from wherever it could, but principally from the Central Bank. At the same time, Central Bank credit rose steadily to keep financing agricultural expansion. Still another direction of Central Bank credit creation was the financing used to handle the government's new structure of multiple exchange rates. Differential rates were used to hold <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of foreign exchange for most imports, again with the dominant goal of holding down inflation, while higher prices of foreign exchange were paid to exporters to protect their incentives to export. The Central Bank thus paid more for the foreign exchange it bought than it received for the exchange it sold.|$|E
500|$|Section 1011 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 1996 {{required}} the United States Navy to reinstate to the Naval Vessel Register {{two of the}} Iowa-class battleships that had been struck by the Navy in 1995; these ships were to be maintained in the United States Navy reserve fleets (or [...] "mothball fleet").

500|$|In April 1984, {{after the}} Congressional hearings, the USAF was {{directed}} to promote FX actively. Several potential customers were briefed during May and June 1984 on the performance and cost of both the F-20 and F-16/79. The Air Force published an internal report on FX in late June 1984. The F-20 was characterized as having outstanding performance against viable threats; and seen {{as a candidate for}} the Air Force's aggressor requirement. The report additionally stated that the F-20 had been contractor-funded, totaling over $750million, compared to $60million on the F-16/79. However, the report concluded that it had little or no market to sell to. The USAF had a vested interest to encourage F-16 sales; larger production numbers would drive <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> per unit. Gregg Easterbrook noted that F-20 may have cast the Air Force in a bad light, as an aircraft developed independent of their input, [...] authors such as Donald Pattillo shared this conclusion. In contrast, the F-16 was heavily involved in the USAF hierarchy, originating from a group of officers known as the [...] "fighter mafia". By March 1985, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of State were reconsidering the policy. Despite some calls to support Northrop, FX was abandoned.|$|E

500|$|The {{development}} of the ZX81 got under way even before the ZX80 had been launched. Sinclair's chief engineer, Jim Westwood, was given the task of improving the ZX80's hardware {{to reduce the number}} of components and thus bring <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost.</b> He also sought to fix some of the more annoying problems with the ZX80. Westwood and his colleagues found that the component count could be reduced greatly by combining eighteen of the ZX80's chips into a single uncommitted logic array (ULA), a type of general-purpose chip full of logic gates that were connected up as the customer required during chip manufacture. This short-lived technology of the day was cheaper and quicker than the design of a customised logic chip, which typically required very high volumes to recoup its development cost. Ferranti produced the new chip for Sinclair, who hailed Westwood's design as a triumph of innovation: [...] "The ZX81 had four chips when our nearest competitor in this respect, the TRS-80, had 44." [...] Only 70% of the logic gates on the ULA were supposed to be used, but Sinclair decided to obtain maximum benefit by using them all. This resulted in the machine becoming uncomfortably warm during usage. Computing folklore held that the ZX81 had to be refrigerated by balancing a carton of cold milk on top of the case.|$|E
