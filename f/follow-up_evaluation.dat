40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} the neuropsychological effects of ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP). METHOD: In a longitudinal matched cohort study, 12 CFP cases and 12 matched friend-controls received baseline neuropsychological evaluations within one month after intoxication and <b>follow-up</b> <b>evaluations</b> approximately six months after baseline. RESULTS: Only one case received intravenous mannitol treatment, which occurred 10 or more days after intoxication. At baseline and <b>follow-up</b> <b>evaluations,</b> there were no statistically significant differences between CFP cases and controls on cognitive measures. At baseline, however, CFP cases endorsed significantly greater subjective toxicity symptoms (e. g. fatigue, tingling sensations) and greater anxiety symptoms than controls. <b>Follow-up</b> <b>evaluations</b> suggested resolution of all symptoms after six months. Subsequent analyses, in which data from this study were pooled with data from an earlier pilot study, supported these results. CONCLUSION: Untreated ciguatera was associated acutely with significant subjective neurotoxicity symptoms and anxiety which were transient, but not with objectively measured cognitive changes.

50|$|As an example, the Texas Legislature {{appropriated}} US$1 {{million for}} a pilot study of statewide athlete screening in 2007. The study employed a combination of questionnaire, examination and electrocardiography for 2,506 student athletes, followed by echocardiography for 2,051 of them, including any students with abnormal findings from the first three steps. The questionnaire alone flagged 35% of the students as potentially at risk, but there were many false positive results, with actual disease being confirmed in less than 2%. Further, {{a substantial number of}} screen-positive students declined repeated recommendations for <b>follow-up</b> <b>evaluation.</b> (Individuals who are conclusively diagnosed with cardiac disease are usually told to avoid competitive sports.)

50|$|A US study, the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, {{looked at}} the general {{effectiveness}} of a screening program involving both PSA and DRE methods. This was conducted between 1993 thu 2001, in which 76,693 men at 10 U.S. study centers 38,343 subjects received screening (an annual PSA testing for 6 years and DRE for 4 years) and a control group of 38,350 subjects received usual care with subjects and health care providers receiving the results and deciding {{on the type of}} <b>follow-up</b> <b>evaluation.</b> Usual care means that some in this group would have received some screening, as some organizations have recommended. After 7 years of follow-up, the incidence of prostate cancer per 10,000 person-years was 116 (2,820 cancers) in the screening group and 95 (2,322 cancers) in the control group. The incidence of death attributed to prostate cancer per 10,000 person-years was 2.0 (50 deaths) in the screening group and 1.7 (44 deaths) in the control group (rate ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.70). The data at 10 years were 67% complete and consistent with these overall findings. The researchers concluded that after 7 to 10 years of follow-up, the rate of death from prostate cancer was very low and did not differ significantly between the two study groups.|$|E
5000|$|Previous studies {{performed}} on TFT have received {{criticism in the}} medical literature. For example, an exploratory study done by Charles Figley, a psychologist who endeavored to find more effective treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder. He examined four novel therapies with a six-month <b>follow-up</b> <b>evaluation</b> (using measures that were not used immediately post treatment) and did not conduct statistical significance testing to compare the therapies. The authors stated that [...] "In contrast to conventional psychotherapy research, the SCD methodology {{is not meant to}} compare the various treatments, and thus does not necessarily meet the criteria proposed for empirically validated treatments, although it does meet some of those criteria," [...] and also stated that [...] "Unfortunately, because of problems with client screening and data collection, the study fell short of reaching its goals. Moreover, the nature of the study precludes comparison of the approaches, and such a comparison was never planned." [...] The authors also noted that because they did not prescreen participants for PTSD, not all participants necessarily met the criteria for PTSD. The authors acknowledged that the study of TFT and the other three methods were incomplete, and noted that [...] "these treatment approaches appear to be promising in helping clients remove the most painful aspects of their traumatic memories." [...] The authors noted that all four approaches warranted further study.|$|E

40|$|Obese {{children}} have attended weight loss camps and residential programmes {{for more than}} 40 years. This paper provides the first systematic review {{of the effects of}} those programmes. Twenty-two studies met inclusion criteria (targeted and assessed change in weight status, minimal stay of 10 days and nights). Similar components across programmes included controlled diet, activities, nutrition education, and therapy and/or education regarding behaviour change. Par-ticipants lost substantial amounts of weight in all 22 studies, as measured by reductions in per cent-overweight during intervention. Eleven programmes included long-term <b>follow-up</b> <b>evaluations.</b> Compared with results highlighted in a recent meta-analysis of out-patient treatments, these immersion programmes pro-duced an average of 191 % greater reductions in per cent-overweight at post-treatment and 130 % greater reduction at follow-up. Furthermore, mean attrition rates were much lower when compared with standard out-patient treatment. Inclusion of a cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) component seemed especially promising; <b>follow-up</b> <b>evaluations</b> showed decreased per cent-overweight at follow-up by an average of 30 % for CBT immersion programmes vs. 9 % for programmes without CBT. Explanations for the potentially greater impact of immersion relative to out-patient treatments are presented, including possibly differential effects on self-efficacy for both children and their parents...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Early {{assignment}} of disease progression among patients with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) {{is critical for}} the appropriate selection of effective therapy. We evaluated the association between contrast enhancement on T 1 -weighted spin-echo MR images and disease progression. METHODS: Clinical charts of patients with X-linked ALD were reviewed for age, availability of MR images of the brain, severity of neurologic impairment, and duration and number of <b>follow-up</b> <b>evaluations.</b> Forty-three male patients with X-linked ALD had undergone multiple MR imaging examinations {{of the brain that}} consisted of at least sagittal and axial T 1 -weighted spin-echo, axial double-echo spin-echo, and contrast-enhanced axial T 1 -weighted spin-echo im-aging. The MR images were reviewed for the presence of contrast enhancement. In addition, global disease burden, as shown by the double-echo spin-echo images, was assessed using a visual scoring method (Loes score).

50|$|In 1965, a {{group of}} parents, {{concerned}} that their children were growing up as English monolinguals in a predominantly French-speaking Quebec, wanted to implement French immersion programs in their community of St. Lambert, Quebec. These parents sought help from bilingualism experts such as Lambert and Richard Tucker to implement these programs. To address the concerns of these parents, Lambert and Tucker designed an experiment in which there were two groups of English-speaking children. One group attended increasing numbers of classes (subjects) taught in French, with the remaining classes taught in English, while the other group received instruction solely in the traditional English. Lambert and Tucker’s objective {{was to determine whether}} learning French would be beneficial for English-speaking children in Quebec’s social and political context. They also sought to evaluate the consequences of learning a second language on academic performance in general. After the fourth year of instruction in their respective groups, the children were compared in terms of their attitudes toward the Francophone community, as well as their academic scores. Results showed that the French immersion group performed as well as the English control group in all academic subjects, while mastering a second language. In a <b>follow-up</b> <b>evaluation,</b> the researchers found that those who had acquired French as a second language had more favourable attitudes toward the French community compared to those in the control groups. The implications of this study led to the successful implementation of many language immersion programs in Canada and around the world.|$|E
