40|$|This {{research}} explores both {{industry and}} temporal aspects of <b>entry,</b> <b>exit</b> and industry turbulence in Austrian manufacturing {{in the period}} between 1981 to 1994. It is shown that while the net entry of both firms and establishments is quite stable over time, exit and especially the turnover and volatility of firms is influenced more by temporal effects. A regression analysis into the determinants of industry dynamics associated with <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> shows that sunk costs, scale economies and industry growth are primary determinants for different <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> <b>regimes</b> across 2 -digit sectors, while profitability {{is found to be}} significant for dynamics related to exit but not for the entry of firms. The net entry dynamics of firms and establishments are found to be different in regard to capital intensity and profitability.

The {{focus is on}} bank <b>exit</b> <b>regimes</b> applicable to commercial banks in New York, London, Frankfurt, Helsinki and Tokyo in 1998 – 2002. Bank <b>exit</b> <b>regimes</b> are studied {{from the perspective of}} bank creditors and bank shareholders. In order to apply econometric methods, the <b>exit</b> <b>regimes</b> are indexed and then evaluated by comparing them with market indicators that reflect the interests of bank creditors and shareholders. These market indicators comprise bank refinancing costs and bank growth rates. In other words, two specific questions are addressed: (1) Do differences in bank <b>exit</b> <b>regimes</b> of significance to bank creditors explain differences in bank refinancing costs? (2) Do differences in bank <b>exit</b> <b>regimes</b> significant to bank shareholders explain differences in bank growth? The study shows that in those financial centres where the probability of bailout is higher, refinancing costs for banks are lower. evaluation, bank, regulation, supervision, reorganisation, liquidation...|$|R

The advisability of applying an <b>entry</b> <b>exit</b> tariff system is discussed in this paper. Apart from this, authors propose an <b>entry</b> <b>exit</b> tariff model {{and apply it to}} compute charges for the Spanish gas transport system in 2009.

40|$|<b>Entry</b> and <b>exit</b> {{are crucial}} {{elements}} of market selection process {{which leads to}} the restructuring, adaptation and evolution of an industry. While the importance of <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> has been recognised, attention has focused almost exclusively on quantifying barriers to them, rather than on investigating the determinants of <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> and measuring the magnitude of these processes. This paper analyses the <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> dynamics of Turkish manufacturing industry defined at the 4 -digit ISIC level for the period 1981 - 1997. While, on the one hand, inflation targeting focuses on the determinants of <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> and their sectoral variation, on the other hand, inflation targeting verifies the link between <b>entry</b> and <b>exit.</b> This paper employs a dynamic panel data estimation procedure to investigate the relationship between <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> and to estimate the models of <b>entry</b> and <b>exit.</b> Our empirical findings suggest that rates of <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> are determined by profit margin, growth rate of output, concentration ratio, labor productivity, average wage rate, advertisement intensity, capital intensity and wage and productivity differentials as explanatory variables.

40|$|The {{interdependence}} between <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> {{of firms}} into manufacturing industries {{is the focus}} of this research. When both <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> equations are estimated separately the results support the existence of strong symmetry in their determinants. When, however, <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> are estimated within a simultaneous equation framework, the empirical evidence does not offer sufficient grounds to support the notion that <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> are simultaneously linked. Instead it seems that they are two contemporaneously related processes which respond in like fashion to the structural characteristics found in particular industries. Their linked response is also extended to factors unaccounted for by the individual <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> formulations, and this expresses itself in significant contemporaneous correlation between the <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> equation residuals. The change in the identities of firms operating, implied by the positive correlation between <b>entry</b> and <b>exit,</b> may then be attributed to industry turbulent conditions, which in turn appear perhaps to be conditioned in the shorter run by time-invariant inter-industry differences in technological factors and sunk costs. ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> decisions, {{considered}} as investment decisions, are investigated in the paper. Taking {{into account the}} heterogeneity of <b>entry</b> and <b>exit,</b> the analysis is based on two types of entry-exit: real (related to the establishment or closing of a firm), or entry-exit in a new sector (indicating the diversification or changing specialisation). The theoretical model is based on Marshallian trigger points with Real Option trigger points as an alternative. The estimation exploited the negative binomial model to investigate the role of trigger points (thresholds) on the observed number of <b>entry</b> or <b>exit</b> firms in Dutch glasshouse horticulture over 25 years. Firms should overcome different thresholds depending on types of <b>entry</b> and <b>exit.</b> Marshallian trigger points function {{as good as the}} ones based on Real Option theory. The estimation of the model, which takes into account expected output prices, uncertainty and the interest rate, however, provides the best explanation of <b>entry</b> and <b>exit.</b> That model can be considered of a flexible variant of Real Option theory.

By applying Bayesian simulation methods we estimate random coefficient models and study the symmetry of {{the determinants of}} <b>entry</b> and <b>exit.</b> Our empirical analysis shows that <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> rates are driven by the same determinants. The impacts of these determinants are nearly homogeneous for both, <b>entry</b> rates and <b>exits</b> rates, respectively. Moreover, we find (i) that changes in average plant size, size heterogeneity and concentration are not symmetric with respect to <b>entry</b> and <b>exit,</b> (ii) that changes {{in the growth of}} sales is weakly symmetric and (iii) that the growth rate of employment is strongly asymmetric across industries in Austrian manufacturing. Furthermore, we infer from the data that the turnover of firms influences the changes in the number of competitors. Low entry rates go hand in hand with low net entry rates and a low turnover.

We show that a heterogeneous-firm model with uncertainty and sunk entry costs can explain these results. In particular, the results are consistent with either uncertainty or sunk costs differing across industries but being similar across countries. We exploit the potential for entrants to begin exporting with small trials in high-entry cost industries to distinguish between the two explanations, and find that sunk entry costs are the main factor...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{interdependence}} between firm <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> from an industrial dynamics perspective. The paper discusses how <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> rates in industrial sectors {{are affected by}} previous <b>exit</b> and <b>entry</b> rates. Economic theory presents two different approaches to how <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> of firms are interrelated, the multiplier effect and the competition effect. This paper intends to investigate which force is the predominant one, for <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> patterns, respectively. The empirical analysis is based on data for 25 Swedish manufacturing industries at the 2 -digit SIC level, during the period 1991 – 2000. In the estimation work the study applies a dynamic panel data approach as suggested by Anderson and Hsiao [Journal of the American Statistical Association, 76 : 598 – 606, 1981] and Arellano and Bond [Review of Economic Studies, 58 (2) : 277 – 297, 1991]. With respect to entry, the empirical results support the multiplier effect such that entry stimulates future entry, but also a competition effect such that past <b>exit</b> induces additional <b>entry.</b> With regard to exit, on the other hand, the competition effect rules, implying that previous <b>entry</b> causes subsequent <b>exit</b> and previous exit reduces subsequent exit.

40|$|Firm <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> {{is a part}} of {{the market}} {{selection}} process by which resources are reallocated within or across industries. The process of <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> influences economic performance through firms' internal restructuring, reallocation of resources among firms and changes in market shares of incumbents. This paper sheds light on the magnitude, characteristics and effectiveness of this process in Tunisian manufacturing industries. To this end we start by circumventing the shortage in firm demographics data by merging, for the first time in Tunisia, administrative files based on continuous reporting of fiscal affiliation of private firms with the register of firm affiliates at the National Social Security Fund in order to compile a series on the number of entering, exiting and total firms with 10 workers or more, by year and by industry over the 1996 – 2004 period. The empirical findings of the paper establish three basic stylized facts: a relatively high firm churning in all Tunisian manufacturing sectors; firm turnover is principally driven by small- and medium-sized firms; and the creative destruction process is the predominant factor driving <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> in many manufacturing industries. Moreover, the combination of heterogeneity in productivity and easy <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> of firms is found to characterize the manufacturing sector in Tunisia. Accordingly, obstacles to free <b>entry</b> and <b>exit</b> slow the reallocation process and are likely to slow productivity growth.
