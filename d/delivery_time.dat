5|$|Prior to {{recovery}} of the Akutan Zero, technical information from three other downed Zeros was available to the Allies. One Zero (serial number 5349), piloted by Hajime Toyoshima, crashed on Melville Island in Australia following the bombing of Darwin. The Zero was heavily damaged, and Toyoshima became Australia's first Japanese prisoner of the Pacific war. Another Zero, piloted by Yoshimitsu Maeda, crashed near Cape Rodney, New Guinea. The team sent to recover the plane erred when they chopped off the wings, severing the wing spars and rendering the hulk unflyable. The third came from China, where Gerhard Neumann was able to reconstruct a working Zero. He used a partly intact Zero (serial number 3372) that had landed in Chinese territory, repaired with salvaged pieces from other downed Zeros. However, bad conditions and the long <b>delivery</b> <b>time</b> from China prevented Neumann's Zero from reaching the United States for testing until after the {{recovery of the}} Akutan Zero.|$|E

Many systems and tools exists to manage the data and transform it to valuable information, if the data is not correct these systems will not be of any help. As a result of this Solar Sverige AB has experienced deviations in their <b>delivery</b> <b>times</b> from the suppliers which is costly, time-consuming and may hurt the firm in the long term. In order to understand what the problem is and to cope with deviating <b>delivery</b> <b>times,</b> performance measurement is suggested as a good approach. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate how coping with deviating <b>delivery</b> <b>times</b> can be handled at a Swedish Electronics and HWS wholesaler. The research approach for this study is qualitative and the empirical data composes primarily of interviews and observations. The challenges with understanding and managing the deviations in the <b>delivery</b> <b>times</b> will be examined by looking at the purchasing process. The findings provide several solutions for how deviating <b>delivery</b> <b>times</b> can be managed, namely by involvement and evaluation in the form of measuring the performance.

40|$|Configure-to-Order (CTO) {{is one of}} {{the common}} market {{interaction}} strategies for suppliers. In CTO, the customer configures the product where bill of materials, drawings and working plans are elaborated automatically. Traditionally, the Order Penetration Point (OPP) is set too early which induces high costs of stock and long <b>delivery</b> <b>times.</b> For assuring short <b>delivery</b> <b>times</b> and low levels of stock, the supply chain should be triggered according to the customer demand. The paper presents an applied research project performed by a German medium-sized windows and doors production company, where a new customer oriented production system was developed and implemented. The main objective of the holistic production system is to allow a Just-in-Time (JIT) production of windows and doors with short operating costs. It is based on the CONstant Work In Progress (CONWIP) approach needed for assuring short <b>delivery</b> <b>times.</b> More in detail, it presents an approach for medium and short-term production planning needed for triggering JIT the first and second-tier supply chain.

Second, we show that a two-phase model with a polynomial algorithm in the second phase is able to produce optimal schedules in a reasonable time. close 3...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the supply of}} housing in the volume building sector {{in the context of}} housing supply shortage and lengthening construction times. It aims to reveal organisation arrangements and work practices that may contribute to delays in building completion times. The paper begins by examining housing supply and <b>delivery</b> <b>times</b> in Australian cities, with statistical analysis establishing that there is an increasing gap between supply and demand, and along side this, a significant rising trend in construction times. The paper then {{examines the}} volume building sector in more detail, considering the changing nature of the housing commodity, the contracting system for organising labour and materials supply, and the management system for housing delivery. Drawing on industry analysis and interviews, the paper argues that existing contract delivery models are experiencing growing pressure, which is in turn contributing to increasing <b>delivery</b> <b>times</b> and costs. In particular it identifies and characterises three issues that help explain increasing <b>delivery</b> <b>times</b> and costs: the increasing complexity in the commodity itself; the challenges of coordinating and scheduling delivery of increasing complex product; and the impacts of poor quality work. In light of these findings, the paper argues for the importance of examining the operations of the housing building industry, {{and the nature of the}} commodity itself, in better understanding the drivers of increasing <b>delivery</b> <b>times</b> and increasing costs in the supply of suburban housing...|$|R
