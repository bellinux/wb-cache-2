5|$|Josquin {{probably}} {{remained in}} the service of Louis XII until 1503, when Duke Ercole I of Ferrara hired him for the chapel there. One of the rare mentions of Josquin's personality survives from this time. Prior to hiring Josquin, one of Duke Ercole's assistants recommended that he hire Heinrich Isaac instead, since Isaac was <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> along with, more companionable, was more willing to compose on demand, and would cost significantly less (120 ducats vs. 200). Ercole, however, chose Josquin.|$|E
5|$|Some uses {{of heavy}} metals, {{including}} in sport, mechanical engineering, military ordnance, and nuclear science, {{take advantage of}} their relatively high densities. In underwater diving, lead is used as a ballast; in handicap horse racing each horse must carry a specified lead weight, based on factors including past performance, so as to equalize the chances of the various competitors. In golf, tungsten, brass, or copper inserts in fairway clubs and irons lower the centre of gravity of the club making it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the ball into the air; and golf balls with tungsten cores are claimed to have better flight characteristics. In fly fishing, sinking fly lines have a PVC coating embedded with tungsten powder, so that they sink at the required rate. In track and field sport, steel balls used in the hammer throw and shot put events are filled with lead in order to attain the minimum weight required under international rules. Tungsten was used in hammer throw balls at least up to 1980; the minimum size of the ball was increased in 1981 to eliminate the need for what was, at that time, an expensive metal (triple the cost of other hammers) not generally available in all countries. Tungsten hammers were so dense that they penetrated too deeply into the turf.|$|E

25|$|In essence, the {{government}} is promising to protect lenders against 80% of their potential loss, and legitimatizes the investment by first having the DOE review their applications.

25|$|As the rhabdoid {{phenotype}} may exclusively {{be associated}} with certain missense mutations in the CK-8 gene (or, possibly, the vimentin gene — see above), it may prove possible to develop specific monoclonal antibodies against certain peptides in these aberrant gene products that may target only rhabdoid cells with these specific mutations.

25|$|Many {{role-playing}} games allow {{players to}} play as an evil character. Although robbing and murdering indiscriminately may make it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> money, there are usually consequences in that other characters will become uncooperative or even hostile towards the player. Thus, these games allow players to make moral choices, but force players {{to live with the}} consequences of their actions. Games often let the player control an entire party of characters. However, if winning is contingent upon the survival of a single character, then that character effectively becomes the player's avatar. An example of this would be in Baldur's Gate, where if the character created by the player dies, the game ends and a previous save needs to be loaded.|$|E
25|$|David Miller {{has criticized}} {{this kind of}} {{criticism}} by Salmon and others because it makes inductivist assumptions. Popper does not say that corroboration is an indicator of predictive power. The predictive power is in the theory itself, not in its corroboration. The rational motivation for choosing a well-corroborated theory {{is that it is}} simply easier to falsify: Well-corroborated means that at least one kind of experiment (already conducted at least once) could have falsified (but did not actually falsify) the one theory, while the same kind of experiment, regardless of its outcome, could not have falsified the other. So it is rational to choose the well-corroborated theory: It may not be more likely to be true, but if it is actually false, it is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of when confronted with the conflicting evidence that will eventually turn up. Accordingly, it is wrong to consider corroboration as a reason, a justification for believing in a theory or as an argument in favor of a theory to convince someone who objects to it.|$|E

25|$|In 1957, {{there were}} 50 GMs (USSR: 19, Yugoslavia: 7, USA: 5, Argentina: 4, West Germany: 2, France: 2, Sweden: 1, Czechoslovakia: 1, Hungary: 1, Austria: 1, Belgium: 1, Denmark: 1, Netherlands: 1, Poland: 1). In 1972, there were 88 GMs with 33 {{representing}} the USSR. The current FIDE ratings list includes over 1000 Grandmasters. Nigel Short was rated the third {{best player in}} the world in 1989 with a rating of 2650; in the 21st century such a rating would only be good enough for a player to reach the top 100 or so, with the third {{best player in the}} world usually rated around 2800. Other minor factors come into play: there are more tournaments worldwide and cheaper air travel makes them more accessible to globe-trotting chess professionals, who include many players from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe whose movements are no longer restricted as they were before the 1990s. Additionally, players can make norms in tournaments that would have been previously considered too short for norms, making norms <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> and allowing for more norm tournaments to be held.|$|E

500|$|Comparisons of Dota 2 {{to other}} MOBA games are commonplace, with the game's {{mechanics}} and business model often being directly compared with League of Legends and Heroes of the Storm.

Comparing Dota 2 to Heroes of the Storm, Jason Parker of CNET said that while Heroes of the Storm was <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into, the complexities and depth of Dota 2 would be appreciated more by those who put in the time to master it.
