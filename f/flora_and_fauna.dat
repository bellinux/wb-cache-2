5|$|Geologically, the Zarqa River {{is about}} 30 million years old. At the river's origin is 'Ain Ghazal, a major archaeological site {{that dates back}} to the Neolithic. Archaeological finds along the course of the river {{indicate}} the area was rich in <b>flora</b> <b>and</b> <b>fauna</b> in the past. The Zarqa River is well known for its amber deposits that date back to the Hauterivian era of the Early Cretaceous (135 m.y.). A remarkable <b>flora</b> <b>and</b> <b>fauna</b> was reported from this amber reflecting tropical paleoenvironmental conditions prevailing during the time of resin deposition (Kaddumi, 2005; 2007).|$|E

The doab (including the Terai) is {{responsible}} for the city's unique <b>flora</b> <b>and</b> <b>fauna.</b> Since the arrival of humans, nearly half of city's vertebrates have become extinct. Others are endangered or have had their range severely reduced. Associated changes in habitat and the introduction of reptiles, snakes and other mammals led to the extinction of bird species, including large birds such as eagles.

5|$|A final {{decision}} was deferred {{until after the}} 1951 election. This resulted in a change of government, with the Conservative Party returning to power and Churchill replacing Attlee as Prime Minister. On 27 December 1951, the High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to Australia informed Menzies of the British government's decision to use Monte Bello. On 26 February 1952, Churchill announced in the House of Commons that the first British atomic bomb test would occur in Australia {{before the end of}} the year. When queried by a Labour Party backbencher, Emrys Hughes, about the impact on the local <b>flora</b> <b>and</b> <b>fauna,</b> Churchill joked that the survey team had only seen some birds and lizards. Among the AERE scientists was an amateur biologist, Frank Hill, who collected samples of the <b>flora</b> <b>and</b> <b>fauna</b> on the islands, teaming up with Commander G.

40|$|Aim The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} and interpret early Holocene <b>floras</b> <b>and</b> <b>faunas.</b> Location The <b>floras</b> <b>and</b> <b>faunas</b> come from various localities in North-east Greenland. Methods Sediment samples were wet sieved, and macrofossils picked out and dated by the AMS radiocarbon-dating method. Results Sediments, dated to the first centuries after the last glacial stage came to an abrupt end, contain a macroflora of bryophytes and a few herbs, and we suggest that these plant remains represent a pioneer vegetation entirely without woody plants. The named species of herbs are either confined to the northern parts of Greenland at present, or they become increasingly more important towards the north. Crowberry is the oldest woody plant recovered; it was present at 10. 4 cal. ka BP, and it appears to have been common during the early Holocene in East Greenland. Main conclusions We suggest that the majority of the extant flora of vascular plants of East Greenland arrived by long distance dispersal during the Holocene. Some species may also have arrived during the late-glacial, and a few hardy species that are adapted to low summer temperatures may have survived the last glacial stage in nonglaciated areas. Some hardy animals may also have survived, but the majority of the fauna are considered Holocene immigrants. We suggest that migrating birds and storms, perhaps in combination, are under-appreciated dispersal vectors...|$|R

5|$|Because of its {{position}} more than 2,000 {{miles from the}} nearest continental landmass, the island of Hawaii {{is one of the most}} geographically isolated landmasses on Earth; this in turn has strongly influenced its ecology.
