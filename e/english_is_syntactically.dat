40|$|Focusing on the {{examples}} of multiple degree modification, this paper argues that the class of degree expressions in <b>English</b> <b>is</b> <b>syntactically</b> and semantically diverse, subdivided both according to the semantic effects of its members {{and according to the}} extent to which they permit, and participate in, multiple layers of modification. We argue that these two factors are linked, and result in (at least) a three-way distinction between TRUE DEGREE MORPHEMES, which map gradable adjectives to properties of individuals and combine with their arguments in a Head-Specifier structure; INTENSIFIERS, which are syntactic and semantic modifiers of properties constructed out of gradable adjectives; and SCALE MODIFIERS, which are also syntactic and semantic modifiers, but which combine with ‘bare ’ gradable adjectives (relations between individuals and degrees) rather than properties formed out of gradable adjectives. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Software {{requirements}} are typically captured in natural languages (NL) such as English and then analyzed by software engineers {{to generate a}} formal software design/model (such as UML model). However, <b>English</b> <b>is</b> <b>syntactically</b> ambiguous and semantically inconsistent. Hence, the English specifications of software requirements can not only result in erroneous and absurd software designs and implementations but the informal nature of English is also a main obstacle in machine processing of English specification of the software requirements. To address this key challenge, there is need to introduce a controlled NL representation for software requirements to generate accurate and consistent software models. In this paper, we report an automated approach to generate Semantic of Business Vocabulary and Rules (SBVR) standard based controlled representation of English software requirement specification. The SBVR based controlled representation can not only result in accurate and consistent software models but also machine process able because SBVR has pure mathematical foundation. We also introduce a java based implementation of the presented approach that is a proof of concept...|$|E
40|$|Oldřich Leška {{introduced}} for {{the description}} of Russian syntax the notion of syntactic polymorphism (i. e. great variety of sentence types), which he related to the weakening of inflexionality. This connection is dubious, because such non-inflexional languages as French or <b>English</b> <b>are</b> <b>syntactically</b> highly monomorphic while the syntax of highly inflexional old Indo-European languages is polymorphic in a way similar to the Russian. The weakening of inflexionality as well as monomorphization of syntax are analogical processes supported by language mixing...|$|R
40|$|There is a dogma about metaphysical realism {{that is well}} nigh universal: "If one is {{a metaphysical}} realist about the {{external}} world, then one {{ought to be a}} semantic realist about external- world statements". I argue that this dogma should be rejected. It is possible for a metaphysical realist to be a "semantic dualist", holding that some middle- sized object statements receive a realist interpretation, but that most such statements require an antirealist interpretation. To show that a semantically dual language is at least possible, I describe a possible world whose inhabitants speak a version of <b>English</b> that <b>is</b> <b>syntactically</b> dual. Further I argue that English in the "actual world" is itself semantically dua...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{approach}} NL 2 OCL to translate English specification of constraints to formal constraints such as OCL (Object Constraint language). In the used approach, input <b>English</b> constraints <b>are</b> <b>syntactically</b> and semantically analyzed to generate a SBVR (Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules) based logical representation that is finally mapped to OCL. During the syntactic and semantic analysis we have also addressed various syntactic and semantic ambiguities that make the presented approach robust. The presented approach is implemented in Java as a proof of concept. A case study has also been solved by using our tool to evaluate {{the accuracy of the}} presented approach. The results of evaluation are also compared to the pattern based approach to highlight the significance of the used approach...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Smaro Kamboureli’s poetic diary records/reports on the {{reconstruction}} of a woman’s identity deconstructed by living as a Greek immigrant in the 1980 s Canadian society. The inner dualism implicit in her bilingualism causes the splitting of the self as mentioned in the book title and makes her live «{{on the edge of}} two languages, on the edge of two selves named and constructed by language » (p. 34). In this paper I analyse the possessive constructions occurring in the text as a structured category unified under cognitive principles (Langacker 2000; Taylor 2000; Fόnagy 2004). Following the procedure adopted in a recent study on the semantic relations encoded by N N and N Prep N instances from a parallel corpus of English and Romance languages (Girju 2009), I carried out a similar study by matching corpus-based evidence and the linguistic diagnostics (cross-linguistic syntactic and semantic mappings) adopted in previous research. In order to perform empirical investigations of the semantics of possessive constructions encoded by nominal phrases (namely N Prep N, N’s N) and compounds (NN) in English, and to test the interpretation of such instances in Italian, I collected the data by digitalizing a bilingual edition of the diary published in 2007. The <b>English</b> version <b>was</b> <b>syntactically</b> parsed using VISL applications/linguistic tools which can provide both syntactic and semantic information on a given constituent structure. Then each N N and N P N instance was manually mapped to the corresponding translations to verify the corpus 2 distribution of the semantic relations per each syntactic construction as well as the role of English and Italian prepositions in the semantic interpretation of possessive constructions. 1...|$|R

We show that detransitivizing reflexivization must involve the assignment of both roles to the same individual, {{along the lines of the}} argument-structure operation of bundling (Reinhart & Siloni 2005), which combines two semantic roles into a single complex role. This allows the bundled roles to be assigned to a single syntactic argument, without special syntactic measures and without violating the theta criterion. We will give empirical support for this analysis by recalling evidence that reflexive verbs are intransitive, and by demonstrating that both theta roles are present in reflexive predicates and <b>are</b> <b>syntactically</b> accessible...|$|R

The experts had experience in formulating MCQs and were asked to assess the MCQs generated from two domain ontologies (an ontology which captures the Arabic vocabulary (Al-Yahya et al. 2010) and a history ontology in Arabic which captures the historical concepts taught to students in the 8 th grade (Al-Yahya 2014; 2011)).

Al-Yahya stated that the difference in the evaluation results was due to the content of the domain ontologies, as the MCQs, which were classified as unacceptable in the history ontology, were dealing with common sense or general knowledge.

Advanced Computational models can be built using many technologies to provide easy communication between human and computers. Data mining has emerged to address problems of understanding ever-growing volumes of information for structured data. Data mining is a process to extract hidden knowledge from huge amount of data {{which can be used}} to build computational model. The usage of Association Rules (AR), one of the data mining techniques, to build an effective communication between human and computers is elucidated in this paper. The comparative performance of two different Association rule algorithms is illuminated in building a model to legalize semantics of sentences in linguistics domain. The sequence of operations to build the model is explored with necessary constraints at each stage. The model is to verify the meaning of <b>English</b> sentences which <b>are</b> <b>syntactically</b> correct using Apriori and Frequent-pattern tree growth algorithm in a limited domain. As a prerequisite, syntax verification of the sentence is also done and as a follow up, it also provides an interface which can be used for interaction between human and computer. The association rules, a data mining concept is employed in semantic analysis in a distinct way. Since the natural language understanding is an endless process, this work opens the door for the usage of association rules in semantic analysis of natural language sentences in a defined domain...|$|R
