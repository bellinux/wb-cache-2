50|$|Mechanical {{forced draught}} is {{provided}} {{by means of a}} fan forcing air into the combustion chamber. Air is often passed through an air heater; which, as the name suggests, heats the air going into the furnace in order to increase the overall efficiency of the boiler. Dampers are used to control the quantity of air admitted to the <b>furnace.</b> Forced <b>draught</b> <b>furnaces</b> usually have a positive pressure.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{mechanical}} induced draught. The first is through use of a steam jet. The steam jet oriented in the direction of flue gas flow induces flue gases into the stack and allows for a greater flue gas velocity increasing the overall <b>draught</b> in the <b>furnace.</b> This method was common on steam driven locomotives which could not have tall chimneys. The second method is by simply using an induced draught fan (ID fan) which removes flue gases from the furnace and forces the exhaust gas up the stack. Almost all induced <b>draught</b> <b>furnaces</b> operate with a slightly negative pressure.|$|R
5000|$|Forced draught: draught is {{obtained}} by forcing {{air into the}} furnace {{by means of a}} fan (FD fan) and duct-work. Air is often passed through an air heater; which, as the name suggests, heats the air going into the furnace in order to increase the overall efficiency of the boiler. Dampers are used to control the quantity of air admitted to the <b>furnace.</b> Forced <b>draught</b> <b>furnaces</b> usually have a positive pressure.|$|R
5000|$|Boilers: 6 {{double ended}} and 6 single ended boilers, 220 lbf/in² (1.52 MPa) steam pressure; 600 degrees Fahrenheit of super heated steam. Oil fuel, forced <b>draught</b> to <b>furnaces.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Induced draught: This is {{obtained}} {{one of three}} ways, the first being the [...] "stack effect" [...] of a heated chimney, in which the flue gas is less dense than the ambient air surrounding the boiler. The denser column of ambient air forces combustion air into and through the boiler. The second method is through use of a steam jet. The steam jet or ejector oriented {{in the direction of}} flue gas flow induces flue gases into the stack and allows for a greater flue gas velocity increasing the overall <b>draught</b> in the <b>furnace.</b> This method was common on steam driven locomotives which could not have tall chimneys. The third method is by simply using an induced draught fan (ID fan) which sucks flue gases out of the furnace and up the stack. Almost all induced <b>draught</b> <b>furnaces</b> have a negative pressure.|$|R
50|$|The {{origins of}} the water-returning engine begin with blowing engines used to provide the <b>draught</b> for blast <b>{{furnaces}}</b> and smelters. Although early furnaces may have been powered by human- or animal-powered bellows, once the Industrial Revolution began the new enlarged furnaces were blown by water wheel-powered blowing houses.|$|R
60|$|To begin, then, with heavenly fire or sunshine. If God's gift {{of vital}} air is {{neglected}} and undervalued, His gift of sunshine {{appears to be}} hated. There are many houses where not a cent has been expended on ventilation, but where hundreds of dollars have been freely lavished {{to keep out the}} sunshine. The chamber, truly, is tight as a box; it has no fireplace, not even a ventilator opening into the stove-flue; but, oh, joy and gladness! it has outside blinds and inside folding-shutters, so that in the brightest of days we may create there a darkness that may be felt. To observe the generality of New England houses, a spectator might imagine they were planned for the torrid zone, where the great object is to keep out a <b>furnace</b> <b>draught</b> of burning air.|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 16th century wind power was {{abandoned}} and the smelting blast {{was provided by}} a bellows driven first by foot, to an ore hearth, and later by water-power in a smelting mill. The mills were fuelled by “white coal”, which was in fact kiln-dried branch wood. Wood was preferred to charcoal for the main furnace, which smelted ore from the mines, as charcoal generated more heat than this furnace required. Drying the wood eliminated smoke, which {{would have made it}} difficult for the smelters to keep the necessary close observation of the process. Charcoal was used in a second furnace, which resmelted the slag from the first, and required greater heat. <b>Draught</b> for the <b>furnaces</b> came from two large bellows driven by the water wheels. Lead ore of all grades was first broken or ground again into finer particles and rewashed to produce very pure ore for the furnace. These smelters could deal with much finer particles of ore and new techniques were introduced to provide them.|$|R
40|$|Trona is {{relatively}} rare, non-metallic mineral, Na 2 CO 3 · NaHCO 3 · 2 H 2 O. The pure material contains 70. 3 % sodium carbonate and by calcination the excess CO 2 and {{water can be}} driven off, yielding natural soda ash. The terms soda ash and sodium carbonate are used interchangeably. Trona calcining is a key process step in production of soda ash (sodium carbonate anhydrate) from the relatively cheap trona ore. The calcination reaction may proceeds in a sequence of steps. Depending on the conditions, it may result in formation of either sodium carbonate monohydrate (Na 2 CO 3 · H 2 O), sodium sesquicarbonate or weigschederite (Na 2 CO 3 · 3 NaHCO 3). The Beypazarı Turkish trona deposit is the second largest deposit {{in the world with}} the content of 84 % trona. The decomposition of trona appeared to be a single stage process across the temperature range studied (150 - 200 °C) with the representative samples of different size fractions in the <b>draught</b> up metallurgical <b>furnace.</b> The optimum particle size and calcination time were − 6. 35 mm and 30 minutes, respectively, at calcination temperature of 175 °C in a metallurgical furnace. Microwave-induced dry calcination of trona was possible and 5 minutes of calcination time at a power level of 900 was sufficient for complete calcination of − 6. 35 mm feed. This includes short time calcinations with the goal of improving economics and simplifying the thermal process...|$|R
