50|$|Beside high {{mechanical}} energy, higher cleaning {{temperatures are}} one of the most effective methods of improving the cleaning results in a parts washer. In general, a 10 to 15 °F (5 to 8 °C) rise doubles the chemical reaction of the detergent. The increased chemical reaction between the <b>greases</b> <b>and</b> <b>oils</b> <b>and</b> the detergent delivers faster cleaning cycles and cleaner parts. Additionally, all <b>greases</b> <b>and</b> <b>oils</b> exhibit a lower viscosity at higher temperatures. Cleaning solution temperatures of 170 F and above softens or melts most <b>oils</b> <b>and</b> <b>greases</b> causing them to flow like water so they are easily removed resulting in faster cleaning, better results and cleaner parts. Many parts washers are not capable of maintaining this operating temperature due to the lack of amply heating systems. Additionally, careful design is required of the pumping system so it can pull in and deliver cleaning solution at temperatures that approach boiling in the parts washer. All centrifugal pumps require a net positive suction head (NPSHr) in order to be able to pump solution. As the temperature of the solution approaches the NPSHr, the pump stops pumping because the cleaning solution flashes to steam in the pump intake. Careful design of the pump is required to minimize NPSHr and allow pumping of high temperature cleaning solution.|$|R
50|$|When the outflow {{from the}} kitchen sink enters the grease trap, the solid food {{particles}} sink to the bottom, while lighter <b>grease</b> <b>and</b> <b>oil</b> floats to the top. The relatively grease-free water is then fed into the normal septic system. The food solids at the bottom <b>and</b> floating <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>grease</b> must be periodically removed {{in a manner similar}} to septic tank pumping. A traditional grease trap is not a food disposal unit. Unfinished food must be scraped into the garbage or food recycling bin. Milkshakes, gravy, sauces and food solids must be scraped off dishes before entering the sink or dishwasher.|$|R
50|$|Most of the {{alternative}} treatment technologies applied today treat wastes after they exit the septic tank; the tank retains settleable solids, <b>grease,</b> <b>and</b> <b>oils</b> <b>and</b> provides an environment for partial digestion of settled organic wastes. Post-tank treatment can include aerobic (with oxygen) or anaerobic (with no or low oxygen) biological treatment in suspended or fixed-film reactors, physical/chemical treatment, soil infiltration, fixed-media filtration, and/or disinfection. The application and sizing of treatment units based on these technologies are defined by performance requirements, wastewater characteristics, and site conditions.|$|R
50|$|The Lambertian {{reflectance}} {{arises from}} the material's surface and immediate subsurface structure. The porous network of thermoplastic produces multiple reflections {{in the first few}} tenths of a millimeter. Spectralon can partially depolarize the light it reflects, but this effect decreases at high incidence angles. Although it is extremely hydrophobic, this open structure readily absorbs non-polar solvents, <b>greases</b> <b>and</b> <b>oils.</b> Impurities are difficult to remove from Spectralon; thus, the material should be kept free from contaminants to maintain its reflectance properties.|$|R
50|$|An {{analysis}} {{of the literature on}} bisphenol A leachate low-dose effects by vom Saal and Hughes published in August 2005 seems to have found a suggestive correlation between the source of funding and the conclusion drawn. Industry-funded studies tend to find no significant effects whereas government-funded studies tend to find significant effects. Sodium hypochlorite bleach and other alkali cleaners catalyze the release of the bisphenol A from polycarbonate containers. Alcohol is one recommended organic solvent for cleaning <b>grease</b> <b>and</b> <b>oils</b> from polycarbonate.|$|R

Cofall continued to be active in the Cleveland sports scene. In 1942 he helped bring the Notre Dame-Navy football game to Cleveland and was {{a founder of the}} Cleveland Touchdown Club.

5000|$|Anti-Friction (AF) {{coatings}} are [...] "lubricating paints" [...] {{consisting of}} fine particles of lubricating pigments, such as molydisulfide, PTFE or graphite, blended with a binder. After application and proper curing, these [...] "slippery" [...] or dry lubricants bond {{to the metal}} surface and form a dark gray solid film. Many dry film lubricants also contain special rust inhibitors which offer exceptional corrosion protection. Most long-wearing films are of the bonded type but are still restricted to applications where sliding distances are not too long. AF-coatings are applied where fretting and galling is a problem (such as splines, universal joints and keyed bearings), where operating pressures exceed the load-bearing capacities of ordinary <b>oils</b> <b>and</b> <b>greases,</b> where smooth running in is desired (piston, camshaft), where clean operation is desired (AF-coatings will not collect dirt <b>and</b> debris like <b>greases</b> <b>and</b> <b>oils),</b> <b>and</b> where parts may be stored {{for long periods of}} time.|$|R
2500|$|For nearly 20 {{years the}} 700, {{along with the}} other two locomotives, sat behind chain link fences, slowly fading and rusting away.
