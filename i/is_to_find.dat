To do this, Kuros must rescue King James' three princesses who are hidden somewhere in Piedup; each of them will grant Kuros a gem and agree to marry him when rescued. The final gem is obtained by defeating a dragon in the town's underworld.|$|E
5|$|Bred {{primarily}} as hunting dogs, their goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the bird, send {{it into the}} air and then to retrieve it on command after the hunter has shot the quarry. The Russian Spaniel is suited for hunting in marshland, fields, woodland, for birds as well as rabbits and other small game. The breed is also popular in their native Russia as their small size makes them suitable to be kept in busy cities, and easily transported to hunting sites.|$|E
5|$|In {{a perfect}} scenario, this would enable every block {{to be written}} to its maximum life so they all fail at the same time. Unfortunately, the process to evenly {{distribute}} writes requires data previously written and not changing (cold data) to be moved, so that data which are changing more frequently (hot data) can be written into those blocks. Each time data are relocated without being changed by the host system, this increases the write amplification and thus reduces {{the life of the}} flash memory. The key <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> an optimum algorithm which maximizes them both.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the criticism that NPC behavior had been too simplistic in Morrowind, Bethesda developed the Radiant A.I. system for Oblivion. NPCs were designed to make choices, rather than complete scripted routines, to achieve predetermined goals. The manner in which goals such as eating, sleeping, reading, and speaking to others are fulfilled is dependent upon the environment, the choices of other NPCs, and programmed personality values. For example, an NPC whose goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> food may eventually resort to stealing from others, if they are given the opportunity {{and if it is}} in their character. These development mechanics allowed Bethesda to create NPCs who could engage in complex activities.|$|E

Random enemy encounters occasionally interrupt travel across the world map screen and hostile areas, as in other Final Fantasy related games.|$|E
5|$|The 2-satisfiability problem <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a truth {{assignment}} to these variables {{that makes the}} whole formula true. Such an assignment chooses whether to make each of the variables true or false, so {{that at least one}} literal to true in every clause becomes true. For the expression shown above, one possible satisfying assignment is the one that sets all seven of the variables to true. Every clause has at least one non-negated variable, so this assignment satisfies every clause. There are also 15 other ways of setting all the variables so that the formula becomes true. Therefore, the 2-satisfiability instance represented by this expression is satisfiable.|$|E

5|$|Hawkwing's Journey is the 9th Super Edition {{novel that}} was {{released}} on 1 November 2016. It follows Hawkwing a apprentice, warrior and eventual deputy of Skyclan. It details the introduction of Darktail, the main antagonist of both Hawkwing's Journey and of the sixth arc A Vision of Shadow. The plot revolves around Darktail's treachery and eventually Skyclan's forced exile from the Gorge territory. Leafstar, the leader of Skyclan decides that the gorge is lost and that the clan's only hope <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{the rest of the}} Warrior Clans. So Skyclan sets out searching for the Lake territories. The book ends with Skyclan still wandering with many of its cats scattered or dead. Despite all this, the cats that remain still held their faith and continued on, trusting Starclan to lead them to the Lake.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the flea}} reaches adulthood, its primary goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> blood {{and then to}} reproduce. Female fleas can lay 5000 or more eggs over their life, {{permitting}} rapid increase in numbers. Generally speaking, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host to provide a blood meal, a flea's life can be as short as a few days. Under ideal conditions of temperature, food supply, and humidity, adult fleas can live {{for up to a}} year and a half. Completely developed adult fleas can live for several months without eating, so long as they do not emerge from their puparia. Optimum temperatures for the flea's life cycle are 21°C to 30°C (70°F to 85°F) and optimum humidity is 70%.|$|E
5|$|One inefficient {{approach}} {{to finding the}} GCD of two natural numbers a and b is to calculate all their common divisors; the GCD is then the largest common divisor. The common divisors can be found by dividing both numbers by successive integers from 2 to the smaller number b. The number of steps of this approach grows linearly with b, or exponentially {{in the number of}} digits. Another inefficient approach <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the prime factors of one or both numbers. As noted above, the GCD equals the product of the prime factors shared by the two numbers a and b. Present methods for prime factorization are also inefficient; many modern cryptography systems even rely on that inefficiency.|$|E
5|$|The {{main idea}} of the {{algorithm}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> pairs of clusters to merge by following paths in the nearest neighbor graph of the clusters. Every such path will eventually terminate at a pair of clusters that are nearest neighbors of each other, and the algorithm chooses that pair of clusters as the pair to merge. In order to save work by re-using {{as much as possible}} of each path, the algorithm uses a stack data structure to keep track of each path that it follows. By following paths in this way, the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm merges its clusters in a different order than methods that always find and merge the closest pair of clusters. However, despite that difference, it always generates the same hierarchy of clusters.|$|E
