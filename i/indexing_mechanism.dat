50|$|With the {{development}} of the revolver in the 19th century, gunsmiths had finally achieved the goal of a practical capability for delivering multiple loads to one handgun barrel in quick succession. Revolvers feed ammunition via the rotation of a cartridge-filled cylinder, in which each cartridge is contained in its own ignition chamber, and is sequentially brought into alignment with the weapon's barrel by an <b>indexing</b> <b>mechanism</b> linked to the weapon's trigger (double-action) or its hammer (single-action). These nominally cylindrical chambers, usually numbering between five and eight {{depending on the size of}} the revolver and the size of the cartridge being fired, are bored through the cylinder so that their axes are parallel to the cylinder's axis of rotation; thus, as the cylinder rotates, the chambers revolve about the cylinder's axis.|$|E
5000|$|Saliency of {{a feature}} {{facilitates}} {{the ease with}} which it can be indexed. For example, the greater the difference between a specific feature and surrounding ones, the more easily it can be indexed. The indexed features, or anchor points, can serve as a [...] "spotlight" [...] that directs focal attention to certain objects, which can then channel visual information to specialized systems for space and shape analysis. Deficits in the spatial <b>indexing</b> <b>mechanism</b> would result in symptoms of simultanagnosia because interpretation of a complex scene requires rapid shifting of attention to various elements, and impairments in spatial indexing lead to the inability to index multiple visual features rapidly. In addition, perception is slowed, and low-level visual processing is disrupted since the patient {{would not be able to}} extract and index salient features.|$|E
5000|$|One {{application}} of the Geneva drive is in movie projectors: the film does not run continuously through the projector. Instead, the film is advanced frame by frame, each frame standing still {{in front of the}} lens for 1/24 of a second (and being exposed twice in that time, resulting in a frequency of 48 Hz). This intermittent motion is achieved using a Geneva drive. (Modern film projectors may also use an electronically controlled <b>indexing</b> <b>mechanism</b> or stepper motor, which allows for fast-forwarding the film.) The first uses of the Geneva drive in film projectors go back to 1896 to the projectors of Oskar Messter and Max Gliewe and the Teatrograph of Robert William Paul. Previous projectors, including Thomas Armat's projector, marketed by Edison as the Vitascope, had used a [...] "beater mechanism", invented by Georges Demenÿ in 1893, to achieve intermittent film transport.|$|E

In {{comparison}} with the conventional <b>indexing</b> cam <b>mechanism,</b> the double crank <b>indexing</b> cam <b>mechanism</b> has a more compact structure due to the coaxial input/output arrangement, and enables more stops to be produced at the same input speed. This paper introduces a dynamic model of the cam system by taking this mechanism as research object, and makes systematic analysis about the constrained forces of the new mechanism. On that basis, {{the effectiveness of the}} approach is validated by the examples. The results of the study provide important theoretical foundation for the working of this new mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Geographic {{visualisation}} {{and other}} real-time applications require efficient data access. An <b>indexing</b> <b>mechanism,</b> {{adapted to the}} characteristics of geographic data, {{can be used to}} improve retrieval of geographic data. This paper describes an <b>indexing</b> <b>mechanism</b> based on a method called Ellipsoidal Quadtree, EQT. EQT adapts the indexing structure of a database to the shape of the earth. EQT fulfils the so-called equal-area criterion, which means that all index cells can be constructed having equal area. Quadtree sub-division makes retrieval faster, because the EQT adjusts to the varying number of objects, which occurs in different areas. The mechanism is tested using a road database containing all national roads in Sweden. The achieved performance is good. The mechanism has a potential to work on parallel-connected computers. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis studies query {{processing}} in {{a mobile}} environment. The main {{objective is to}} investigate the performance improvement of mobile query processing, focusing on the server and client sides. In server side query processing, we consider single-cell and multi-cell queries, whereby a cell is a service area for a single stationary host to communicate with a static network. A quick response in answer to a mobile query is important, because mobile users invariably move to another location while awaiting the query result. To handle such a dynamic situation, we proposed solutions to answer single-cell and multi-cell queries. The proposed solutions for processing single-cell queries are divided into static and dynamic query scopes, and angle of movement. The static and dynamic query scopes are extended to process multi-cell queries. Furthermore, another solution is added {{in order to deal}} with a situation where the areas of several base stations are either disjoint or overlapping. Finally, our algorithms also handle disconnections which occur during query result transmission from a base station to the mobile users. <b>Indexing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are important to speed up query processing, especially for handling multi-cell queries. We propose two <b>indexing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> called Local <b>Index</b> and Global <b>Index</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The local <b>index</b> stores indexes of any requested objects with limited slots, whereas the global index builds the index while a base ii station is starting up. For both mechanisms, we developed algorithms to deal with the existence and non-existence of replicated objects at the requested cell. Frequent disconnections is a common problem occurring in a mobile environment. Providing a cache in a mobile device is an important consideration. A cache is useful if the repeat of many queries can be retrieved from the cache. Due to the limitation of storage space in the mobile device, we have developed three cach...|$|R
