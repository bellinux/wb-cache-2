However, no SDM studies have directly tested the performance of <b>disturbance</b> <b>variables.</b> In this study, we developed two disturbance variables: a geomorphic index (GEO) and an index of snow redistribution by wind (SNOW). These were developed {{in order to assess}} how they improved both the fit and predictive power of presenceabsence SDM based on commonly used topoclimatic (TC) variables for 91 plants in the Western Swiss Alps. The individual contribution of the <b>disturbance</b> <b>variables</b> was compared to TC variables. Maps of models were prepared to spatially test the effect of <b>disturbance</b> <b>variables.</b> On average, <b>disturbance</b> <b>variables</b> significantly improved the fit but not the predictive power of the TC models and their individual contribution was weak (5. 6 % for GEO and 3. 3 % for SNOW). However their maximum individual contribution was important (24. 7 % and 20. 7 %). Finally, maps including <b>disturbance</b> <b>variables</b> (i) were significantly divergent from TC models in terms of predicted suitable surfaces and connectivity between potential habitats, and (ii) were interpreted as more ecologically relevant. <b>Disturbance</b> <b>variables</b> did not improve the transferability of models at the local scale in a complex mountain system, and the performance and contribution of these variables were highly species-specific. However, improved spatial projections and change in connectivity are important issues when preparing projections under climate change because the future range size of the species will determine the sensitivity to changing conditions...|$|R

30|$|A {{different}} kind of problem emerged after preliminary classification tree analyses. The <b>disturbance</b> <b>variables</b> (distance to nearest previous burn in the 1960 s, 1970 s, and 1980 s) gave results that did not make sense ecologically: at some regression splits, greater distances to burned areas were modeled to have higher likelihood of high cheatgrass cover (≥ 10 %), not lower cover, {{as would be expected}} if the previously burned areas were functioning as seed sources. The reason for these results are not obvious, but probably reflect the non-random spatial pattern of previous fires in DINO, and the fact that at least some cheatgrass is present almost everywhere in DINO. We determined that inclusion of these <b>disturbance</b> <b>variables</b> in the final BRT models would obscure rather than enhance the actual patterns of postfire cheatgrass dynamics, and so they were deleted before the final BRT runs.|$|R

However, many studies have limited value for conservation because they fail to account for habitat associations at multiple spatial scales, anthropogenic variables, and imperfect detection. We addressed these three limitations by developing models for an endangered wetland bird, Yuma Ridgway's rail (Rallus obsoletus yumanensis), that examined how the spatial scale of environmental variables, inclusion of anthropogenic <b>disturbance</b> <b>variables,</b> and accounting for imperfect detection in validation data influenced model performance. These models identified associations between environmental variables and occupancy. We used bird survey and spatial environmental data at 2473 locations throughout the species' U. S. range to create and validate occupancy models and produce predictive maps of occupancy. We compared habitat-based models at three spatial scales (100, 224, and 500 m radii buffers) with and without anthropogenic <b>disturbance</b> <b>variables</b> using validation data adjusted for imperfect detection and an unadjusted validation dataset that ignored imperfect detection. The inclusion of anthropogenic <b>disturbance</b> <b>variables</b> improved the performance of habitat models at all three spatial scales, and the 224 -m-scale model performed best. All models exhibited greater predictive ability when imperfect detection was incorporated into validation data. Yuma Ridgway's rail occupancy was negatively associated with ephemeral and slow-moving riverine features and high-intensity anthropogenic development, and positively associated with emergent vegetation, agriculture, and low-intensity development. Our modeling approach accounts for common limitations in modeling species-habitat relationships and creating predictive maps of occupancy probability and, therefore, provides a useful framework for other species...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Digital {{components}} play {{a central}} role in the design of complex embedded systems. These components are interconnected with other, possibly analog, devices and the physical environment. This environment cannot be entirely captured and can provide inaccurate input data to the component. It is thus important for digital components to have a robust behavior, i. e. the presence of a small change in the input sequences should not result in a drastic change in the output sequences. In this paper, we study a notion of robustness for sequential circuits. However, since sequential circuits may have parts that are naturally discontinuous (e. g., digital controllers with switching behavior), we need a flexible framework that accommodates this fact and leaves discontinuous parts of the circuit out from the robustness analysis. As a consequence, we consider sequential circuits that have their input variables partitioned into two disjoint sets: control and <b>disturbance</b> <b>variables.</b> Our contributions are (1) a definition of robustness for sequential circuits as a form of continuity with respect to <b>disturbance</b> <b>variables,</b> (2) the characterization of the exact class of sequential circuits that are robust according to our definition, (3) an algorithm to decide whether a sequential circuit is robust or not.
