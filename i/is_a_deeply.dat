Giving of one's competence, sharing one's time, material or intellectual ability with those among whom one lives, for {{the relief of}} hardship, pain or ignorance <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeply</b> ingrained tradition which shapes the social conscience of the Ismā'īlī Muslim community.|$|E

25|$|I have no {{difficulty}} accepting the appellants' contention that {{whether or not}} sexual orientation is based on biological or physiological factors, which may {{be a matter of}} some controversy, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeply</b> personal characteristic that is either unchangeable or changeable only at unacceptable personal costs, and so falls within the ambit of s. 15 protection as being analogous to the enumerated grounds.|$|E
25|$|Radiography <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeply</b> diverse {{profession}} {{with many}} different modalities and specialities. It {{is not uncommon}} for radiographers to be specialised in more than one modality and even have expertise of interventional procedures themselves; however this depends on the country in which they operate. As a result of this the typical career pathway for a radiographer is hard to summarise. Upon qualifying it is common for radiographers to focus solely on plain film radiography before specialising in any one chosen modality. After a number of years in the profession, non-imaging based roles often become open and radiographers may then move into these positions.|$|E
25|$|A' Bhuidheanach Bheag’s best {{geographical}} {{feature is the}} remote Cama Choire {{on the eastern side}} of the mountain. This is a steep sided valley which cuts deeply into the hill and is drained by the Allt a’ Chama Choire. The coire is well seen from the hill of An Dun above the Gaick Pass. From a geological point of view the most interesting characteristic of the mountain is Coire Mhic-sith on its south-western flank. The coire <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeply</b> incised, fault-guided valley which has received the attention of geologists, especially the School of Geoscience at the University of Edinburgh who have concluded that the presence of glacial silt and sand in the valley along with a glacial spillway to the adjacent valley of the Edendon Water means that the coire had a large ice dammed lake during the last Ice age. This Proglacial lake drained away when the ice melted but has left evidence similar, but on a lesser scale, to the “parallel roads” in Glen Roy.|$|E

500|$|Wollstonecraft's Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeply</b> {{personal}} travel narrative. The twenty-five letters cover {{a wide range}} of topics, from sociological reflections on Scandinavia and its peoples to philosophical questions regarding identity to musings on her relationship with Imlay (although he is not referred to by name in the text). Using the rhetoric of the sublime, Wollstonecraft explores the relationship between the self and society. Reflecting the strong influence of Rousseau, Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark shares the themes of the French philosopher's Reveries of a Solitary Walker (1782): [...] "the search for the source of human happiness, the stoic rejection of material goods, the ecstatic embrace of nature, and the essential role of sentiment in understanding". While Rousseau ultimately rejects society, however, Wollstonecraft celebrates domestic scenes and industrial progress in her text.|$|E
500|$|The reader's {{experience}} of Lucy is {{filtered through the}} narrator's perception. Her death suggests that nature can bring pain to all, even to those who loved her. According to the British classical and literary scholar H. W. Garrod (1878–1960), [...] "The truth is, as I believe, that between Lucy's perfection in Nature and her death there is, for Wordsworth, really no tragic antithesis at all." [...] Hartman expands on this view to extend the view of death and nature to art in general: [...] "Lucy, living, is clearly a guardian spirit, not of one place but of all English places... while Lucy, dead, has all nature for her monument. The series <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeply</b> humanized version {{of the death of}} Pan, a lament on the decay of English natural feeling. Wordsworth fears that the very spirit presiding over his poetry is ephemeral, and I think he refuses to distinguish between its death in him and its historical decline." ...|$|E
500|$|As mankind {{comes in}} contact with this terrifying beauty {{represented}} by these angels, Rilke {{is concerned with the}} experience of existential angst in trying {{to come to terms with}} the coexistence of the spiritual and earthly. [...] He portrays human beings as alone in a universe where God is abstract and possibly non-existent, [...] "where memory and patterns of intuition raise the sensitive consciousness to a realization of solitude." [...] Rilke depicts the alternative, a spiritually fulfilling possibility beyond human limitations in the form of angels. Beginning with the first line of the collection, Rilke's despairing speaker calls upon the angels to notice human suffering and to intervene. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeply</b> felt despair and unresolvable tension in that no matter man's striving, the limitation of human and earthly existence renders humanity unable to reach out to the angels. [...] The narrative voice Rilke employs in the Duino Elegies strives [...] "to achieve in human consciousness the angel's presumed plenitude of being" [...] (i.e. being, or existence, in German: Dasein).|$|E

500|$|In 2012, New York artist Sophia Wallace {{started work}} on a {{multimedia}} project to challenge misconceptions about the clitoris. Based on O'Connell's 1998 research, Wallace's work emphasizes the sheer scope {{and size of the}} human clitoris. She says that ignorance of this still seems to be pervasive in modern society. [...] "It is a curious dilemma to observe the paradox that on the one hand the female body is the primary metaphor for sexuality, its use saturates advertising, art and the mainstream erotic imaginary," [...] she said. [...] "Yet, the clitoris, the true female sexual organ, is virtually invisible." [...] The project is called Cliteracy and it includes a [...] "clit rodeo", which is an interactive, climb-on model of a giant golden clitoris, including its inner parts, produced with the help of sculptor Kenneth Thomas. [...] "It's been a showstopper wherever it's been shown. People are hungry {{to be able to talk}} about this," [...] Wallace said. [...] "I love seeing men standing up for the clit [...] Not having access to the pleasure that is your birthright <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeply</b> political act." ...|$|E
500|$|Otis Phillips Lord, {{an elderly}} {{judge on the}} Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court from Salem, in 1872 or 1873 became an {{acquaintance}} of Dickinson's. After the death of Lord's wife in 1877, his friendship with Dickinson probably became a late-life romance, though as their letters were destroyed, this is surmised. Dickinson found a kindred soul in Lord, {{especially in terms of}} shared literary interests; the few letters which survived contain multiple quotations of Shakespeare's work, including the plays Othello, Antony and Cleopatra, Hamlet and King Lear. In 1880 he gave her Cowden Clarke's Complete Concordance to Shakespeare (1877). Dickinson wrote that [...] "While others go to Church, I go to mine, for are you not my Church, and have we not a Hymn that no one knows but us?" [...] She referred to him as [...] "My lovely Salem" [...] and they wrote to each other religiously every Sunday. Dickinson looked forward to this day greatly; a surviving fragment of a letter written by her states that [...] "Tuesday <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeply</b> depressed Day".|$|E
500|$|Stephanie Zacharek of Salon felt {{positively}} {{about the}} episode itself but ambivalent {{about the lack}} of resolution, stating, [...] "I'm not sure if Tuesday night's finale <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeply</b> unsatisfying way to close out a series that's ending before its time or the only way to end such a series." [...] However, she blamed the network for this ending. She also commented on the tone and themes of the episode, arguing that one of the series's main takeaways was that the rich would always be in charge. However, she did not view the finale as being spiteful and pessimistic: [...] "'Veronica Mars' has always been a clear-eyed show, never a bitter one." [...] Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly felt unsatisfied with the episode's conclusion, partially because Veronica and Logan did not resume dating. However, he praised the sex-tape mystery and the plot involving the Castle because of their similarities to earlier seasons. He also praised Keith's actions, stating, [...] "Okay, maybe I'm a sap, but this tugged at my heartstrings a bit and left me relieved there wasn't a dreaded Veronica–Keith battle at the end." [...] Stransky concluded by saying that [...] "the end is fine". Sydney Bucksbaum of Zap2it felt disappointed because of the ambiguous endings of Keith's arc and Veronica's love triangle. Although she was positive towards [...] "The Bitch Is Back" [...] as a standalone episode, she found herself hoping that there were another episode to the season: [...] "Watching Veronica walk out into the pouring rain all alone after casting a probably insignificant vote for her dad was depressing, symbolic (rain in SoCal?), and just downright unsatisfying." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pro-choice and civil-liberties groups {{criticized the}} ruling. Cecile Richards, {{president}} of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said, [...] "Today, the Supreme Court ruled against American women and families, giving bosses the right to discriminate against women and deny their employees access to birth control coverage. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeply</b> disappointing and troubling ruling that will prevent some women, especially those working hourly-wage jobs and struggling to make ends meet, from getting birth control." [...] Deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union Louise Melling said, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeply</b> troubling decision. For the first time, the highest court in the country has said that business owners can use their religious beliefs to deny their employees a benefit that they are guaranteed by law." ...|$|E
