5|$|The Rjukan Line {{was built}} {{with a maximum}} {{gradient}} of 1.5%. In addition to the line to the plant, a branch line went to the hydroelectric power station at Vemork; completed in 1908 <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> used for service technicians to the power station and had a gradient of 5.7%. Construction in Vestfjorddalen was led by Sigurd Kloumann.|$|E
5|$|Milner and British {{official}} Lionel George Curtis {{were the}} architects of the Round Table movement, a network of organizations promoting closer union between Britain and its self-governing colonies. To this end, Curtis founded the Royal Institute of International Affairs in June 1919 and, with his 1938 book The Commonwealth of God, began advocating for the creation of an imperial federation that eventually reannexes the U.S., which would be presented to Protestant churches as being the work of the Christian God to elicit their support. The Commonwealth of Nations was created in 1949 but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> a free association of independent states rather than the powerful imperial federation imagined by Rhodes, Milner and Curtis.|$|E

5|$|There {{was little}} support for {{compulsory}} military service amongst the public, however, and combined with the financial pressure that the government felt {{at that time to}} reduce defence spending, the 1920 recommendations were not fully implemented. Although the compulsory training scheme was retained, it was decided that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> focused on the more populated areas, essentially ending the scheme in rural areas. The result of this was that the course of only a year the strength of the Citizens Forces fell from 127,000 to only 37,000 in 1922. Throughout the 1920s, numbers decreased even further and although the divisional structure was maintained, it {{was little more than a}} skeleton force as units found their numbers dropping drastically.|$|E
5|$|A list of {{necessary}} equipment was compiled by 1 August and included, among other things, massive cables, capstans, pulleys, and 40 pounds of tallow for lubrication. The proposed salvage team comprised 30 Venetian mariners and a Venetian carpenter with 60 English sailors to serve them. The two ships {{to be used}} as hulks were Jesus of Lübeck and Samson, each of 700tons burthen and similar in size to the Mary Rose. Brandon was so confident of success that he reassured the king that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> a matter of days before they could raise the Mary Rose. The optimism proved unfounded. Since the ship had settled at a 60-degree angle to starboard much of it was stuck deep into the clay of the seabed. This made it virtually impossible to pass cables under the hull and required far more lifting power than if the ship had settled on a hard seabed. An attempt to secure cables to the main mast appears only to have resulted in its being snapped off.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the great}} French naval superiority, the French had {{conducted}} insufficient pre-war planning for {{an assault on}} the Prussian naval installations, and concluded that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> possible with Danish assistance, which was not forthcoming. The four ships, under the command of Vice Admiral Jachmann, made an offensive sortie in early August 1870 out to the Dogger Bank, though they encountered no French warships. Friedrich Carl and the other two broadside ironclads thereafter suffered from chronic engine trouble, which left Arminius alone to conduct operations. Friedrich Carl, Kronprinz, and König Wilhelm stood off the island of Wangerooge {{for the majority of the}} conflict, while Arminius was stationed in the mouth of the Elbe river. On 11 September, the three broadside ironclads were again ready for action; they joined Arminius for another major operation into the North Sea. It too did not encounter French opposition, as the French Navy had by this time returned to France.|$|E

5|$|Mitchell and Galle sent an {{anonymous}} complaint to the TMB detailing their concerns with Arafiles's care of nine patients in 2008 and 2009. The letter {{said that the}} nurses feared losing their jobs if their identities were revealed {{in connection with the}} complaint. Arafiles became aware of the complaint and spoke to Winkler County Sheriff Robert Roberts, alleging that the complaint amounted to harassment. The TMB issued a copy of the complaint to Roberts with the understanding that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> used to investigate criminal activity by Arafiles. Roberts sent the complaint to Arafiles and to WCMH administrator Stan Wiley. As WCMH was a small hospital, details from the letter identified Mitchell and Galle as the sources of the complaint.|$|E
5|$|The AGM-129 was fielded in 1987 as a {{stealthy}} {{cruise missile}} platform {{to deliver the}} W80-1 variable yield nuclear warhead. Although originally designed to equip the B-1B Lancer bomber, the AGM-129 was redesignated so that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> carried by the B-52H, mounted on external pylons on the wings or internally in the bomb bay. In March 2007, the USAF decided to retire its AGM-129 complement {{in order to help}} comply with international arms-control treaties and to replace them with AGM-86 missiles. In order to do so, the USAF began to transport its AGM-129s stored at Minot to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana by B-52s for ultimate disposal. According to The Washington Post, by 29 August 2007, more than 200 AGM-129s had been shipped from Minot to Barksdale in this manner.|$|E

It too did not encounter French opposition, as the French Navy had by this time returned to France. After the war, the Prussian Navy became the Imperial Navy, and resumed its peacetime training routines. General Albrecht von Stosch became the chief of the Imperial Navy, and organized the fleet for coastal defense.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the late Republic, {{formerly}} authoritative institutions lost their credibility and authority. For example, the Sullan reforms to the Senate strongly split the aristocratic class between those who stayed in the city and those who rose to high office abroad, further increasing class divides between Romans, even at the highest levels. Furthermore, the dominance of the military in the late Republic, along with stronger ties between a general and his troops, caused by their longer terms of service together and the troops' reliance on that general to provide for their retirements, along with an obstructionist central government, meant a huge number of malcontent soldiers willing to take up arms against the state. Adding in the institutionalisation of violence as a means to obstruct or force political change (e.g. the deaths of the Gracchi and Sulla's dictatorship, respectively), the Republic was caught in an ever more violent and anarchic struggle between the Senate, assemblies at Rome, and the promagistrates. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> resolved by civil war, a war which the promagistrate governors and their troops would win, and in doing so, collapse the Republic.|$|E
5|$|The mall {{also added}} new burdens to city services, with {{building}} inspectors {{having to work}} overtime to inspect each store area as it was completed. While mall security was issued citation books so they could issue parking tickets directly, the city police still had to work double shifts to cover the traffic during the mall's opening weekend. Overall, the mall increased traffic on the Earl Rudder Freeway, and city traffic engineers noted it would cause more traffic backup. Traffic signals {{were added to the}} mall's main entrance, while long-term plans were made to both expand the freeway and add additional interchanges along Harvey. Traffic studies were implemented to study the traffic after the mall's opening to developed additional plans to mitigate issues. There were concerns that the mall would be the final blow to the downtown area of neighboring city Bryan, Texas, which was already suffering reduced business after the opening of smaller Manor East Mall and the Townshire shopping center, both within Bryan. Bryan city officials noted an immediate decrease in revenue due to Sears moving from Bryan to College Station, taking $50–100,000 of sales taxes with it. However, as a whole the city was hopeful that the mall would have benefits to the city in the form of increased city growth as a whole. The city planners felt <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> a passing fad for local rural and lower-income families, who would still return to downtown Bryan due to its proximity.|$|E

25|$|Robertson told ministers (30 May) that “Haig {{had no idea}} of {{any attempt}} to break through the German lines. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> a move to (rescue) the French”, {{although}} he was probably not aware of Haig’s insistence, overruling Rawlinson’s earlier plan, on bombarding deeper into the German defences in the hope of breaking through and “fighting the enemy in the open”. Maurice later wrote (29 June) Haig “does not mean to knock his head against a brick wall, and if he finds he is only making a bulge and meeting with heavy opposition he means to stop and consolidate and try somewhere else”.|$|E
50|$|The name Handsworth {{originates}} {{from its}} Saxon owner Hondes and the Old English word weorthing, meaning farm or estate. It {{was recorded in}} the Domesday Survey of 1086, as a holding of William Fitz-Ansculf, the Lord of Dudley, although at that time <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> have <b>been</b> a very small village surrounded by farmland and extensive woodland.|$|R

25|$|Unlike its rival, the Supermarine Attacker, {{which had}} been the first jet {{aircraft}} to enter service with the FAA, the Sea Hawk had a tricycle undercarriage rather than a tail-wheel, making it easier to land on carriers, it was also Hawker's first aircraft to incorporate a nose-wheel undercarriage. The Sea Hawk had adopted a fairly conventional design, being built with straight wings while a number of other contemporary aircraft, such as the F-86 Sabre, had adopted swept wings. The Sea Hawk was a reliable and elegant aeroplane, though its cautious design meant <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> attractive on the export market, and thus be in production, for only a short period before being superseded by more advanced aircraft.|$|E
25|$|King Alexander {{tried to}} keep a policy of neutral governments {{but he did not}} have much success. Therefore, on 9 May 1894 he {{conducted}} another coup, abolished the Constitution from 1888 and put into force the old one from 1869. Milan's return to Serbia did not last long because he quickly got into a conflict with his son. A week after his departure, Queen Natalija was allowed to return to Serbia. Natalija invited Alexander to come to Biarritz. When he visited his mother, he met Draga - who was 12 years older than him - and immediately fell in love with her. Natalija knew about this affair but did not pay much attention to it believing that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> a short-lived adventure.|$|E
25|$|On 12 November 1970, the {{municipal}} council voted {{to establish a}} limited company to finance the bridge.

During the council meeting, representatives for the municipal administration commented that 85 {{percent of the people}} from Askøy who worked outside the municipality worked in the city center of Bergen; they were transported quickly with ferries which were not hampered by congestion. Should a bridge be built, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> able to be financed if people traveled using the bridge, and therefor terminating the ferry, even though it provided a superior service, was proposed.|$|E
