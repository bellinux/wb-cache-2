25|$|Brown et al. (1983) {{noted that}} time series studies {{to that point}} had found that for a 10 percent <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wage,</b> there was a {{decrease}} in teenage employment of 1–3 percent. However, the studies found wider variation, from 0 to over 3 percent, in their estimates for the effect on teenage unemployment (teenagers without a job and looking for one). In contrast to the simple supply and demand diagram, it was commonly found that teenagers withdrew from the labor force {{in response to the}} minimum wage, which produced the possibility of equal reductions in the supply as well as the demand for labor at a higher minimum wage and hence no impact on the unemployment rate. Using a variety of specifications of the employment and unemployment equations (using ordinary least squares vs. generalized least squares regression procedures, and linear vs. logarithmic specifications), they found that a 10 percent <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> caused a 1 percent decrease in teenage employment, and no change in the teenage unemployment rate. The study also found a small, but statistically significant, increase in unemployment for adults aged 20–24.|$|E
25|$|As {{governor}} of Massachusetts {{and as a}} candidate for president, Romney has called for tying raises in the national minimum wage to indicators of growth in the economy, such as increases in the inflation rate. He has said that increases in the minimum wage should be moderate and predictable. Commenting in March 2012 on a proposal put forward by some Democratic legislators to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10 per hour, Romney said that an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> was probably not necessary at that time.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, {{the minimum}} wage in New Jersey {{increased}} from $4.25 to $5.05 per hour (an 18.8% increase), while in the adjacent state of Pennsylvania it remained at $4.25. David Card and Alan Krueger gathered information on fast food restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania {{in an attempt to}} see what effect this increase had on employment within New Jersey. A basic supply and demand model predicts that relative employment should have decreased in New Jersey. Card and Krueger surveyed employers before the April 1992 New Jersey increase, and again in November–December 1992, asking managers for data on the full-time equivalent staff level of their restaurants both times. Based on data from the employers' responses, the authors concluded that the <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>wage</b> slightly increased employment in the New Jersey restaurants.|$|E

40|$|The {{employment}} {{effect of}} <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> wage {{is one of}} the most studied topics in all of economics. This report examines the most recent wave of this research [...] roughly since 2000 [...] to determine the best current estimates of <b>the</b> impact of <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> wage on <b>the</b> employment prospects of low-wage workers. The weight of that evidence points to little or no employment response to modest <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> wage. <b>The</b> report reviews evidence on eleven possible adjustments to minimum-wage increases that may help to explain why the measured employment effects are so consistently small. The strongest evidence suggests that the most important channels of adjustment are: reductions in labor turnover; improvements in organizational efficiency; reductions in wages of higher earners ("wage compression"); and small price increases. Given the relatively small cost to employers of modest <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> wage, these adjustment mechanisms appear to be more than sufficient to avoid employment losses, even for employers with a large share of low-wage workers...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impacts of}} trade liberalization in a non-integrated industry where a marketing agency controls the supply of a necessary input <b>in</b> <b>the</b> production of a processed commodity. Trade of the processed good is restricted through a Tariff-Rate Quota (TRQ) and domestic processors operate in an imperfectly competitive industry. Under a fixed proportions technology, an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> access commitment of the TRQ will generally lower the domestic retail price to consumers if the marketing agency is a profit-maximizing monopolist. Conversely, if the marketing agency pursues some specific non-economic objectives, it is shown that <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> access commitment holding the tariff rates constant can lead to higher retail prices and thus negate the benefits of trade liberalization for consumers. ...|$|R

Unemployed workers ineligible for jobless benefits were given back the right to claim sickness insurance that they had lost in 1979 while the reimbursal of the costs of dental fees, hearing aids, and glasses was improved. An 80-franc-per-month charge that had been imposed on certain long-term illnesses was abrogated, and certain individuals who had retired before 1973 had the base upon which their pensions were calculated adjusted upward. Between 1981 and 1983, the minimum vieillesse (the basic pension benefit for the elderly poor) was raised by 62%.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Balanced {{steady-state}} free precession (SSFP) is a rapid, short TR {{imaging technique}} {{well suited for}} cardiac imaging because of its high SNR and excellent blood-myocardial contrast (1, 2). However, SSFP {{is limited by the}} fact that water and fat both appear bright and are difficult to distinguish, possibly obscuring underlying pathology. A recently described three-point “Dixon ” water-fat separation technique has been applied to multi-coil cardiac SSFP CINE imaging to generate separate water and fat CINE images (3). Unfortunately, the decomposition of water from fat requires a three-fold <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> scan time, compared to conventional SSFP CINE imaging.

Kennedy worked with Republican Senator Nancy Kassebaum to create and pass the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in 1996, which set new marks for portability of insurance and confidentiality of records. The same year, Kennedy's Mental Health Parity Act forced insurance companies to treat mental health payments the same as others with respect to limits reached. In 1997, Kennedy was the prime mover behind the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which used increased tobacco taxes to fund the largest expansion of taxpayer-funded health insurance coverage for children in the U.S. since Medicaid began in the 1960s.
