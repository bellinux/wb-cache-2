5|$|The {{chemical}} bond between atoms occurs {{as a result}} of electromagnetic interactions, as described by the laws of quantum mechanics. The strongest bonds are formed by the sharing or transfer of electrons between atoms, allowing the formation of molecules. Within a molecule, electrons move under the influence of several nuclei, and occupy molecular orbitals; much as they can occupy atomic orbitals in isolated atoms. A <b>fundamental</b> <b>factor</b> in these molecular structures is the existence of electron pairs. These are electrons with opposed spins, allowing them to occupy the same molecular orbital without violating the Pauli exclusion principle (much like in atoms). Different molecular orbitals have different spatial distribution of the electron density. For instance, in bonded pairs (i.e. in the pairs that actually bind atoms together) electrons can be found with the maximal probability in a relatively small volume between the nuclei. By contrast, in non-bonded pairs electrons are distributed in a large volume around nuclei.|$|E

40|$|Asymmetric Correlation is an {{empirical}} observation that correlations between security returns are significantly higher during market downturns compared to upturns. Previous literature {{has focused on}} examining this asymmetry {{by way of a}} rigorous statistical analysis. However, the sources of this phenomenon had not been explored yet. In this paper, I propose a simply hypothesis: asymmetric correlations can be explained in terms of the securities 2 ̆ 7 underlying <b>fundamental</b> <b>factors.</b> Using the recently proposed Dynamic Conditional Correlations (DCC) class of GARCH models, I estimate the covariance of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>factors</b> and model securities 2 ̆ 7 returns. I find that <b>fundamental</b> <b>factors</b> can only partially explain the asymmetric correlation. In my final model, I show that despite taking <b>fundamental</b> <b>factors</b> into account, the correlations still exhibit asymmetry. Therefore behavioral factors also {{play a significant role in}} causing this phenomenon. Modeling behavioral causes will be the next important step towards understanding asymmetric correlation...|$|R

The idea is derived from study of Rokhim (2006); which stated that banks with higher related lending will be more fragility. In that study, she identifies several <b>fundamental</b> <b>factors</b> such as Cost of Fund; Size and Net Open Position. Different with Rokhim (2006), we focus {{to the effect of}} ownership type toward bank performance. We argue that related lending couki be caused by ownership type. As we know from agency, theory, the more concentrated ownership the higher related lending. Three important findings of our research are as follow: 1) Ownership Type and <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Factors</b> have significant effect toward bank performance. It implies to support indirectly study of Rokhim (2006). 2) From eight variables of ownership type only family; foreign, Soeharto, Listed and Cross and three variables of <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Factors,</b> only cost respectively have a significant effect in level 5 % toward bank performance unless family. 3) Robustness test with GLS fixed effect has consistent result with OLS non data panel...|$|R

In a discussion on oligopoly research, Paul Joskow pointed out in 1975 that in practice, serious students of actual economies tended to use [...] "informal models" [...] based upon qualitative factors specific to particular industries. Joskow had a strong feeling that the important work in oligopoly was done through informal observations while formal models were [...] "trotted out ex post". He argued that formal models were largely not important in the empirical work, either, and that the <b>fundamental</b> <b>factor</b> behind {{the theory of the}} firm, behaviour, was neglected.|$|E

30|$|Most of {{the studies}} are {{featured}} with f_t given by the so-called <b>fundamental</b> <b>factors,</b> i.e., historic time series {{of a set of}} macroeconomic or fundamental indexes. With the hidden factors chosen, the problem becomes a typical multivariate linear regression problem: r_t = a + Af_t + e_t. However, choosing these <b>fundamental</b> <b>factors</b> is not an easy task. Chen et al. (1986) chose five macroeconomic factors, including surprises in GDP, inflation, investor confidence, and yield curve. Also, others consider index or spot or future market price, e.g., short-term interest rate, a diversified stock index, oil price, gold or precious metal prices, and currency exchange rate in place of macroeconomic factors. With efforts over decades, little progress has been achieved on identifying the number and nature of these <b>fundamental</b> <b>factors.</b> Many researchers believe that this issue is essentially empirical in nature, because the factors change over time and between economies.|$|R
