25|$|If <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to define}} {{terms such as}} '{{psychology}}' with such precision, why bother? Why not just agree {{that we all have}} at least a rough idea of what psychology is, and take {{the rest of the afternoon}} off? After all, if theoretical or empirical work improves our understanding of some aspect of the world or our fellow people, or improves our ability to help people enhance their physical or emotional well being, what difference does it make whether this work is considered a part of psychology, of cognitive science, of behavioral neuroscience, of public health, or what have you? This raises the question of what definitions in general are good for.|$|E
25|$|Much {{less common}} than colorless zircon is colorless scheelite. Its {{dispersion}} (0.026) is also {{high enough to}} mimic diamond, but although it is highly lustrous its hardness is much too low (4.5–5.5) to maintain a good polish. It is also anisotropic and fairly dense (SG 5.9–6.1). Synthetic scheelite produced via the Czochralski process is available, but {{it has never been}} widely used as a diamond simulant. Due to the scarcity of natural gem-quality scheelite, synthetic scheelite is much more likely to simulate it than diamond. A similar case is the orthorhombic carbonate cerussite, which is so fragile (very brittle with four directions of good cleavage) and soft (hardness 3.5) that it is never seen set in jewelry, and only occasionally seen in gem collections because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> to cut. Cerussite gems have an adamantine luster, high RI (1.804–2.078), and high dispersion (0.051), making them attractive and valued collector's pieces. Aside from softness, they are easily distinguished by cerussite's high density (SG 6.51) and anisotropy with extreme birefringence (0.271).|$|E
500|$|After the UK release, Dickon Stainer, head of Universal Classics and Jazz, {{spoke of}} plans to {{publicise}} Faryl in the US, saying [...] "America {{is going to}} be key. Because of her history on the talent show there's already a great deal of interest in her. The demand is intense." [...] In April 2009, Smith travelled to Los Angeles to begin her promotion of Faryl in the US. She appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in early May as part of her promotional tour. Faryl was released in the US on 5 May. Smith said before the release that she did not expect it to sell as well {{as it did in the}} UK. She said that [...] "in the US it's a lot harder because I'm not as well-known. In the UK, a lot of people obviously watched 'Britain's Got Talent' and stuff, and that was like fresh in everyone's minds." [...] After the release, she was more optimistic, saying [...] "hen I performed in New York, it reminded me of the HMV signing in Kettering and there was quite a big queue so I think my album was well received." [...] Smith returned from the US in early May. Despite the contrary being said when she performed on the third series of Britain's Got Talent, Smith had no plans for a concert tour in 2009; she was quoted as saying that [...] "I'm too young and don't think I would be able to do a tour on my own". However, she did plan to return to the US during her summer holidays to again promote Faryl. She said that [...] "everyone in America was really nice and they do like classical music, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> to make it over there ... They seem to like their own singers, but I will just keep trying my best". However, she instead took a short break from her music career in summer, before returning to the recording studio later in the year for Wonderland, her second album, which was released in November.|$|E

2500|$|A {{good that}} is rivalrous but non-excludable is {{sometimes}} called a common-pool resource. Such goods raise similar issues to public goods: the mirror to the public goods problem for this case {{is sometimes called}} the [...] "tragedy of the commons". For example, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> to enforce restrictions on deep sea fishing that the world's fish stocks {{can be seen as}} a non-excludable resource, but one which is finite and diminishing.|$|E
2500|$|One reason veins are {{preferred}} over arteries for intravascular {{administration is}} because the flow will pass through the lungs before passing through the body. [...] Air bubbles can leave the blood through the lungs. [...] A patient with a right-to-left shunt is vulnerable to embolism from smaller amounts of air. Fatality by air embolism is rare, although this may be in part because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> to determine when this {{is the cause of}} death.|$|E
2500|$|Testing by the Norwegian {{military}} {{revealed the}} Krag–Petersson was a robust, accurate and quick-firing weapon, and the Royal Norwegian Navy adopted the rifle in 1876. The rifle was extensively tested by other nations, but none adopted it. After being phased out around 1900, the remaining rifles {{were sold to}} civilians and often were extensively rebuilt. Today, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> to find one in original condition that the Krag–Petersson {{has been described as}} [...] "the rifle everybody has heard about, but hardly anybody has ever seen". It was the first rifle designed by Ole H. J. Krag to be adopted by an armed force.|$|E

2500|$|In 1995 {{economist}} Robert Whaples {{stated that}} measuring {{the effect of}} the New Deal remains a thorny issue for economists because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> to measure the effects it had on the country. A survey of academic specialists by Whaples showed that 49% of those economists surveyed felt that the New Deal lengthened and deepened the depression, while 51% disagreed. The same survey also showed that only 5% of professional historians and 27% of professional economists felt the same way. However, economist Eric Rauchway of the University of California stated [...] "very few people disapprove of most of the New Deal reforms", which include Social Security, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., and Fannie Mae. Regardless, unemployment peaked in 1932 at 25% and was reduced to 13.9% by 1940.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the trial}} he {{presented}} {{the case for}} Kantor as follows, [...] "My Lord, {{it is difficult to}} reply in a restrained fashion. My learned friend must not use words such as 'Communist' lightly, when he refers to Kantor. Kantor is not a Communist. My learned friend has used the tactics of McCarthyism in an endeavour to smear him. I think, with respect, my learned friend is allowing himself to run away with facts that are not there. His complaint in count one is not that they found files with evidence. Oh not, he says that 'we found files with nothing in them', not in Kantor's office, but in the office of Wolpe. Then my learned friend [...] that the practice had been ruined and liquidated Kantor's practice. My lord, it is not Kantor. It is not Kantor! Why I say <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> to be restrained, is that my learned friend has thrown in everything that concerns every accused in this case, and says 'that is why I don't want Kantor to get bail.|$|E
2500|$|It {{could be}} that it is {{extremely}} difficult to start life. It might be that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> to start life that it has happened only once among all the planets... Let us consider, just as a conjecture, that the chance life starting when we have got suitable physical conditions is 10−100. I don't have any logical reason for proposing this figure, I just want you to consider it as a possibility. Under those conditions ... it is almost certain that life would not have started. And I feel that under those conditions {{it will be necessary to}} assume the existence of a god to start off life. I would like, therefore, to set up this connexion between the existence of a god and the physical laws: if physical laws are such that to start off life involves an excessively small chance, so that it will not be reasonable to suppose that life would have started just by blind chance, then there must be a god, and such a god would probably be showing his influence in the quantum jumps which are taking place later on. On the other hand, if life can start very easily and does not need any divine influence, then I will say that there is no god.|$|E

2500|$|German {{critics were}} positive. Julia Evers of Oberösterreichische Nachrichten called the film [...] "an oppressive and {{impressive}} moral painting, in which neither the audience nor {{the people in}} the village find an escape valve from the web of authority, hierarchy and violence. [...] Everything in The White Ribbon is true. And that is why <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> to bear." [...] Markus Keuschnigg of Die Presse praised the [...] "sober cinematography" [...] along with the pacing of the narrative. Challenging accusations of Haneke's cinematic approach being cold and cynical, Keuschnigg instead hailed the director as uncompromising and sincerely humanistic. Die Welts Peter Zander compared the film to Haneke's previous works Benny's Video and Funny Games, concluding that while the violence in the previous films had seemed distant and constructed, The White Ribbon demonstrates how it is a part of human society. Zander also applauded the [...] "perfectly cast children", whom he held as [...] "the real stars of this film". In Der Spiegel, Christian Buß opined that the work is [...] "a horror drama, free from horror images", and praised its deviations from conventions of contemporary German cinema, writing that [...] "Haneke forces us to learn how to see again".|$|E
