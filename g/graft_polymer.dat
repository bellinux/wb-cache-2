40|$|Graft {{polymerization}} of glycidyl methacrylate {{onto the}} pore surface of polyacrylamide macroporous gel was implemented in DMSO-aqueous solution using diperiodatocuprate(III) complexes as an initiator.

The <b>graft</b> polymerization of <b>polymer</b> inside the pores of the macroporous gel resulted in increased flow resistance through the gel matrix. The distribution of <b>grafted</b> <b>polymer</b> on the gel pore surface material was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). CLSM is an alternative method for studying morphology of gel surface with <b>grafted</b> <b>polymer</b> having the advantages over the SEM allowing to investigate the distribution of <b>grafted</b> <b>polymer</b> inside the hydrogel in a native hydrated state.

5000|$|Graft Polymers are {{segmented}} copolymers with {{a linear}} backbone of one composite and randomly distributed branches of another composite. The picture labeled [...] "graft polymer" [...] shows how grafted chains of species B are covalently bonded to polymer species A. Although the side chains are structurally {{distinct from the}} main chain, the individual grafted chains may be homopolymers or copolymers.Graft polymers have been synthesized for many decades and are especially used as impact resistant materials, thermoplastic elastomers, compatibilizers, or emulsifiers for the preparation of stable blends or alloys. One of the more well known examples of a <b>graft</b> <b>polymer</b> is high impact polystyrene, which consists of a polystyrene backbone with poly butadiene grafted chains.|$|E
5000|$|High impact {{polystyrene}} (HIPS) {{was discovered}} by Charles F. Fryling in 1961. HIPS is a low cost, plastic material that is easy to fabricate and often used for low strength structural applications when impact resistance, machinability, and low cost are required. Its major applications include machined prototypes, low-strength structural components, housings, and covers. In order to produce the <b>graft</b> <b>polymer,</b> polybutadiene (rubber) or any similar elastomeric polymer is dissolved in styrene and polymerized. This reaction allows for two simultaneous polymerizations, that of styrene to polystyrene {{and that of the}} graft polymerization of styrene-rubber. During commercial use, it can be prepared by graft copolymerization with additional polymer to give the product specific characteristics.The advantages of HIPS includes: ...|$|E

50|$|Graft {{copolymers}} are a branched copolymer {{where the}} components of the side chain are structurally different than that of the main chain. Graft copolymers containing a larger quantity of side chains are capable of wormlike conformation, compact molecular dimension, and notable chain end effects due to their confined and tight fit structures.The preparation of graft copolymers has been around for decades. All synthesis methods can be employed to create general physical properties of graft copolymers. They can be used for materials that are impact resistant, and are often used as thermoplastics elastomers, compatibilizers or emulsifiers for the preparation of stable blends or alloys. Generally, grafting methods for copolymer synthesis results in materials that are more thermostable than their homopolymer counterparts.There are three methods of synthesis, grafting onto, grafting from, and grafting through that are used to construct a <b>graft</b> <b>polymer.</b>|$|E
50|$|The grafting-through {{also known}} as the macromonomer method {{is one of the more}} simpler ways of synthesizing a <b>graft</b> <b>polymer</b> with well defined side chains. Typically a monomer of a lower {{molecular}} weight is copolymerized with free radicals with an acrylate functionalized macromonomer. The ratio of monomer to macromonomer molar concentrations as well as their copolymerization behavior determines the number of chains that are grafted. As the reaction proceeds, the concentrations of monomer to macromonomer change causing random placement of branches and formation of graft copolymers with different number of branches. This method allows for branches to be added heterogeously or homogenously based on the reactivity ratio of the terminal functional group on the macromolecular to the monomer. The difference in distribution of grafts has significant effects on the physical properties of the grafted copolymer. Polyethylene, polysiloxanes and poly(ethylene oxide) are all macromonomers that have been incorporated in a polystyrene or poly(methyl acrylate) backbone.|$|E

30|$|In {{this paper}} the {{suitability}} of a <b>graft</b> <b>polymer</b> nanocomposite hydrogel system for enhanced oil recovery was examined using polyacrylamide graft starch/clay nanocomposite (a laboratory synthesized product) and chromium (III) acetate (crosslinker). X-ray diffraction analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry analysis, field-emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were carried out to reveal the laboratory synthesized product as a nanocomposite. The effects of various parameters like salt concentration, pH, temperature, polymer concentration and crosslinker concentration on {{the properties of the}} developed gel system were systematically evaluated. The thermal stability of the nanocomposite gel and the conventional gel system were also determined by thermogravimetric analysis. The <b>graft</b> <b>polymer</b> nanocomposite gel system exhibited acceptable gel strength, gelation time and gel stability compared with the conventional gel system. The nanocomposite gels prepared using a low crosslinker concentration showed higher gel strength and required longer gelation time than the conventional gel which is more desirable properties for the effective placement of gel during enhanced oil recovery operations. In addition, sand pack flooding experiments show that the <b>graft</b> <b>polymer</b> nanocomposite gels had better plugging capacity than the conventional gel systems under reservoir conditions. Hence, this gel system may be suitable in the water shutoff treatments required for enhanced oil recovery from oilfields.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Environmentally {{responsive}} poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) brushes were grafted {{from the}} surface of polymer particles or flat surfaces in order to generate reversible hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces. The use of atom transfer radical polymerization was demonstrated for the <b>grafting</b> of <b>polymer</b> brushes as it allows efficient control on the amount of <b>grafted</b> <b>polymer.</b> The polymer particles were generated with or without surfactant in the emulsion polymerization and their surface could be modified with the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) initiator. The uniform functionalization of the surface with ATRP initiator was responsible for the uniform <b>grafting</b> of <b>polymer</b> brushes. The <b>grafted</b> brushes responded reversibly with changes in temperature indicating that the reversible responsive behavior could be translated to the particle surfaces. The particles were observed to adsorb and desorb protein and virus molecules by changing the temperatures below or higher than 32 °C. The initiator functionalized particles could also be adsorbed on the flat surfaces. The adsorption process also required optimization of the heat treatment conditions to form a uniform layer of the particles on the substrate.
