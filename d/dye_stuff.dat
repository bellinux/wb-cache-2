In Mexico, the big merchant families continued to dominate trade, with the main merchant house in Mexico City and smaller outlets staffed by junior members of the family in provincial cities. For merchants in Guatemala City dealing in indigo, they had direct contact with merchants in Cádiz, the main port in Spain, indicating the level of importance of this <b>dye</b> <b>stuff</b> in trade as well as the strengthening of previously remote areas with larger trade networks, in this case by passing Mexico City merchant houses.

However, there were some examples of indigo and ultramarine being used alone, for example indigo was mixed with lead white in the sky while ultramarine was used for dark blue areas in Safavid folios from Shiraz (Table  1, # 32). Unusually, indigo is the only blue used on one folio from Cairo, 1354, (Table  1, # 12) despite the use of ultramarine in a companion folio from the same manuscript, (Table  1, # 11), indicating deliberate artistic choice rather than lack of availability of the more commonly used ultramarine.|$|E

ABSTRACT: Azo dyes constitute the largest family of synthetic dyes. They are widely used in the textile, <b>dye</b> <b>stuff</b> and pharmaceutical industries. The uncontrolled and undesirable discharge of the azo dyes into the environment may represent a serious ecological problems and health effects. The oxidation of azo dyes (e. g., Photo-oxidation, Oxidation by ozone) leads to its degradation. To determine the reactivity and the active sites of azo dye reactive Orange 16 (RO 16), we calculated its electronic and optical properties by using DFT and TD-DFT methods at B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 +G(,p) level in solvent (IEF-PCM model). The results showed that RO 16 is polar and high soluble compounds in water. The Fukui indices showed that the N 11 is the favoured site of nucleophilic attack (e. g, ozone).

Cadmium {{is one of the most}} toxic, non-biodegradable heavy metals and accumulated by absorption into living organisms (Victor et al. 2007). Cadmium toxicity effects include renal dysfunction, hypertension, hepatic injury, lung damage, anemia and teratogenic effects (Yu et al. 1999; Lodeiro et al. 2006; Kaewsarn and Yu 2001; Cheung et al. 2001). Cadmium pollution is due to metal plating, metallurgic alloying, ceramics, textile printing industry, photograph development, electroplating, alkaline battery manufacturing industries (Kadirvelu et al. 2001; Zhu et al. 2007). Therefore, cadmium level in wastewater, drinking water and water used for agriculture should be limited to the maximum permissible concentration (0.01  mg/L) (WPCRT 2004). The usual methods for the removal of heavy metal ions including cadmium from aqueous solutions can be stated as chemical precipitation, ion exchange, solvent extraction, phytoextraction, ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, electrodialysis and adsorption (Patterson 1985; Bhattacharya and Mandal 2006). However, technical or economic constraints limit sometimes the feasibility of such processes.|$|E
