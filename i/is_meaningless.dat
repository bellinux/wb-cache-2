5|$|Ignosticism is {{the view}} that a {{coherent}} definition of a deity must be put forward before {{the question of the}} existence of a deity can be meaningfully discussed. If the chosen definition is not coherent, the ignostic holds the noncognitivist view that the existence of a deity <b>is</b> <b>meaningless</b> or empirically untestable.|$|E
5|$|The play is a {{statement}} {{on the idea that}} a man is valued by his position in life. Loman never matures enough to realize that being popular without any substance or skill <b>is</b> <b>meaningless</b> in the end and Miller uses Loman to make his point against the anti-intellectualists. In the end, Loman gives way to the belief that his inability to be a successful man and father is condemning.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{argument in}} favor of dualism is that the mental and the physical seem to have quite different, and perhaps irreconcilable, properties. Mental events have a subjective quality, whereas physical events do not. So, for example, one can reasonably ask what a burnt finger feels like, or what a blue sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like to a person. But it <b>is</b> <b>meaningless,</b> or at least odd, to ask what a surge in the uptake of glutamate in the dorsolateral portion of the hippocampus feels like.|$|E

It had only to be forsaken to <b>be</b> inane, <b>meaningless.</b> And she knew it <b>was</b> <b>meaningless.</b> But it needed a great, passionate effort of will on her part, seeing the colliery, still to maintain her knowledge that it <b>was</b> <b>meaningless.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{biological}} classification humans are animals, a basic point {{which has been}} known for more than 2,000 years. The creationist J. Rendle-Short asserted in Creation magazine that if people are taught evolution they can be expected to behave like animals: since animals behave in all sorts of different ways, this <b>is</b> <b>meaningless.</b> In evolutionary terms, humans are able to acquire knowledge and change their behaviour to meet social standards, so humans behave in the manner of other humans.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, Ayer wrote Language, Truth and Logic, {{in which}} he claimed that {{religious}} language <b>is</b> <b>meaningless.</b> He put forward a strong empirical position, arguing that all knowledge must either come from observations of the world or be necessarily true, like mathematical statements. In doing so, he rejected metaphysics, which considers {{the reality of a}} world beyond the natural world and science. Because it is based on metaphysics and is therefore unverifiable, Ayer denounced religious language, as well as statements about ethics or aesthetics, as meaningless. Ayer challenged the meaningfulness of all statements about God– theistic, atheistic and agnostic– arguing that they are all equally meaningless because they all discuss the existence of a metaphysical, unverifiable being.|$|E
5|$|Many {{critics have}} {{challenged}} the second premise of this argument, {{by offering a}} biological and sociological account {{of the development of}} human morality which suggests that it is neither objective nor absolute. This account, supported by biologist E. O. Wilson and philosopher Michael Ruse, proposes that the human experience of morality is a by-product of natural selection, a theory philosopher Mark D. Linville calls evolutionary naturalism. According to the theory, the human experience of moral obligations was the result of evolutionary pressures, which attached a sense of morality to human psychology because it was useful for moral development; this entails that moral values do not exist independently of the human mind. Morality might be better understood as an evolutionary imperative in order to propagate genes and ultimately reproduce. No human society today advocates immorality, such as theft or murder, because it would undoubtedly lead to the end of that particular society and any chance for future survival of offspring. Scottish empiricist David Hume made a similar argument, that belief in objective moral truths is unwarranted and to discuss them <b>is</b> <b>meaningless.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{properties}} of the system are subject to a principle of incompatibility. Certain properties cannot be jointly defined for the same system at the same time. The incompatibility is expressed quantitatively by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

However, good acts are rewarded by increases in the character's spiritual barometer, which affect the chances of the player destroying AM in the final adventure.

25|$|Binary operations: The {{notion of}} {{addition}} (+) is abstracted {{to give a}} binary operation, ∗ say. The notion of binary operation <b>is</b> <b>meaningless</b> without the set on which the operation is defined. For two elements a and b in a set S, a ∗ b is another element in the set; this condition is called closure. Addition (+), subtraction (−), multiplication (×), and division (÷) can be binary operations when defined on different sets, as are addition and multiplication of matrices, vectors, and polynomials.|$|E

25|$|The Pepsi and Coca-Cola example <b>is</b> <b>meaningless</b> in {{the context}} of Indian {{beverage}} market. More competition is lacking because of limited demand. Indian consumer has limited interest in soft drinks. Soft drinks represent less than 5% of Indian beverage market. Indian consumers prefer milk-based, tea and coffee and these account for 90% of Indian beverage market, with plenty of competing domestic brands and even European brands like Nestlé. The next most important market in India is bottled water, which outsells the combined soft drink sales of the Pepsi and Coca-Cola. Organised retail too will have numerous brands and strong competition.|$|E
25|$|In Judaism, Ecclesiastes is read {{either on}} Shemini Atzeret (by Yemenites, Italians, some Sepharadim, and the mediaeval French Jewish rite) {{or on the}} Shabbat of the Intermediate Days of Sukkot (by Ashkenazim). If there is no Intermediate Sabbath of Sukkot, even the Ashkenazim read it on Shemini Atzeret (or, for Ashkenazim in the Land of Israel, on the first Shabbat of Sukkot). It is read on Sukkot as a {{reminder}} to not get too {{caught up in the}} festivities of the holiday, as well as to carry over the happiness of Sukkot {{to the rest of the}} year by telling the listeners that, without God, life <b>is</b> <b>meaningless.</b> When the listeners take this to heart, then true happiness can be achieved throughout the year.|$|E
25|$|The {{guaranteed}} {{cycle count}} may {{apply only to}} block zero (as {{is the case with}} TSOPNAND devices), or to all blocks (as in NOR). This effect is mitigated in some chip firmware or file system drivers by counting the writes and dynamically remapping blocks in order to spread write operations between sectors; this technique is called wear leveling. Another approach is to perform write verification and remapping to spare sectors in case of write failure, a technique called bad block management (BBM). For portable consumer devices, these wearout management techniques typically extend the life of the flash memory beyond the life of the device itself, and some data loss may be acceptable in these applications. For high reliability data storage, however, it is not advisable to use flash memory that would {{have to go through a}} large number of programming cycles. This limitation <b>is</b> <b>meaningless</b> for 'read-only' applications such as thin clients and routers, which are programmed only once or at most a few times during their lifetimes.|$|E

25|$|However, as {{knowledge}} of physiology has {{increased over the}} past two hundred years, so has the understanding of the physical process of singing and vocal production. As a result, many vocal pedagogists, such as Ralph Appelman at Indiana University and William Vennard at the University of Southern California, have redefined or even abandoned the use of the terms chest voice and head voice. In particular, the use of the terms chest register and head register have become controversial since vocal registration is more commonly seen today as a product of laryngeal function that is unrelated to the physiology of the chest, lungs, and head. For this reason, many vocal pedagogists argue that it <b>is</b> <b>meaningless</b> to speak of registers being produced in the chest or head. They argue that the vibratory sensations which are felt in these areas are resonance phenomena and should be described in terms related to vocal resonance, not to registers. These vocal pedagogists prefer the terms chest voice and head voice over the term register. This view believes that the problems which people identify as register problems are really problems of resonance adjustment. This view is also in alignment with the views of other academic fields that study vocal registration including speech pathology, phonetics, and linguistics. Although both methods are still in use, current vocal pedagogical practice tends to adopt the newer more scientific view. Also, some vocal pedagogists take ideas from both viewpoints.|$|E
