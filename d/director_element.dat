50|$|The {{fact that}} the {{parasitic}} element involved is not exactly resonant but is somewhat shorter (or longer) than λ/2 modifies the phase of the element's current with respect to its excitation from the driven element. The so-called reflector element, being longer than λ/2, has an inductive reactance which means the phase of its current lags the phase of the open-circuit voltage that would be induced by the received field. The <b>director</b> <b>element,</b> on the other hand, being shorter than λ/2, has a capacitive reactance with the voltage phase lagging that of the current.|$|E
50|$|The {{elements}} {{are given the}} correct lengths and spacings so that the radio waves radiated by the driven element and those reradiated by the parasitic elements all arrive {{at the front of}} the antenna in phase, so they superpose and add, increasing signal strength in the forward direction. In other words, the crest of the forward wave from the reflector element reaches the driven element just as the crest of the wave is emitted from that element. These waves reach the first <b>director</b> <b>element</b> just as the crest of the wave is emitted from that element, and so on. The waves in the reverse direction interfere destructively, cancelling out, so the signal strength radiated in the reverse direction is small. Thus the antenna radiates a unidirectional beam of radio waves from the front (director end) of the antenna.|$|E

This antenna, called the microstrip Yagi array, has been developed for the mobile satellite (MSAT) system as a low-profile, low-cost, and mechanically steered medium-gain land-vehicle antenna. With the antenna's active patches (driven elements) and parasitic patches (reflector and <b>director</b> <b>elements)</b> located on the same horizontal plane, the main beam of the array can be tilted, by the effect of mutual coupling, in the elevation direction providing optimal coverage for users in the continental United States.

With the complete monopulse beamforming and power distributing circuits etched on a single thin stripline board underneath the microstrip Yagi array, the overall L-band antenna system has achieved a very low profile for vehicle's rooftop mounting, as well as a low manufacturing cost. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of this antenna...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The Yagi-Uda arrays {{are widely}} used in {{communications}} and radar for high-gain applications. A typical three element Yagi array with optimized dimensions can achieve a gain as high as about 10 dBi.

In addition, a mast is required to structurally support the array elements in air. We recently proposed a new class of multi-layer printed antenna structures as a low-profile alternative to the conventional Yagi-Uda array of wire dipoles [1].
