40|$|Introduction: Timely {{diagnosis}} of the gastroduodenal perforation usually allows primary repair or resection. Treatment of a large gastric perforation is more difficult than the common duodenal ulcer perforation by plugging and usually requires agastric resection. On the other hand, gastric resection fora hemodynamically compromised patient in sepsis hasa high rate of anastomotic failure and mortality. Here, we described a practical surgical technique that can avoid emergency gastric resection in such situations. Presentation of case: A 83 year-old female admitted with peritonitis, severe sepsis and hemodynamic instability. After the {{diagnosis of}} hollow organ perforation and supportive therapy, laparotomy revealed a delayed and large (7  cm) gastric perforation. Instead of gastrectomy, we downsized the large defect {{by means of a}} purse-string suture around the perforation and made it suitable for the application of omental plugging. Discussion: The patients with poor performance status who are not suitable for the gastric resection, a <b>free</b> omental <b>plug</b> fixation to the narrowed perforation area by a purse-string suture can overcome the problem. Conclusion: This method can be keep in mind as a damage control surgery technique in the non-traumatic abdominal emergencies due to large gastric perforations...|$|R
5000|$|TV Buffet. TV Buffet opened as {{a general}} Southern-style buffet-style {{restaurant}} with miniature televisions mounted along the buffet line so that customers could keep track of favorite shows while they loaded their plates. However, the proprietor of the establishment did not reckon with the high cable bill and so shut down the televisions. Having no ambient sound to drown out the sounds of people chewing and more led to increased stress and anger among the patrons, and so the owner began offering <b>free</b> ear <b>plugs</b> to teach guest. Jackie reported later that the owner had again changed the concept and name, with the restaurant now called Piano Bar Buffet and featuring local pianists Drauncey Piddleton (who is quite flashy) and Ripley Combo. Eventually, the buffet was removed, and the Piano Bar Buffet featured two shows each evening. This continued until a fight between the two performers led to them quitting; Piddleton was reportedly envious of {{the growing popularity of}} Combo, who was known for his ability to catch Combos in his mouth while performing. All that remains now is a solitary television, some chairs, and a vending machine in the back.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This work {{investigates the}} use of the {{underwater}} explosion (UNDEX) for the <b>free</b> and <b>plug</b> assisted cup forming processes. Design/methodology/approach: A 3 D finite element model is built to simulate the process of the UNDEX cup forming using ABAQUS finite element code. Johnson-Cook (JC) material plasticity model is used to represent strain rate sensitivity of the used materials. Johnson- Cook damage criterion is employed to detect the onset of damage in the cup forming process. Findings: Both relatively hard and soft plugs are considered and the effects of using different plug materials on cup profile, strains and the limiting drawing ratios are given. The onset of damage in this process is also indicated. The results suggest that a relatively hard plug can enhance the control of the cup shape and the uniformity of strain distribution leading to increased limiting drawing ratio. Research limitations/implications: This work suggests a methodology for the prediction of shape, different strain distribution, the limiting drawing ratio and the energy required for UNDEX cup forming process. Practical implications: This study could be useful in non-conventional high energy rate forming industry. Originality/value: The study reveals the possibility of producing flat-bottomed cup by the relatively hard plug assisted UNDEX forming technique...|$|R

40|$|A four-helix bundle is a well-characterized motif {{often used}} as a target for {{designed}} pharmaceutical therapeutics and nutritional supplements. Recently, we discovered a new structural complexity within this motif created by a disulphide bridge in the long-chain helical bundle cytokine epileptic When oxidized, leptin contains a disulphide bridge creating a covalent-loop through which part of the polypeptide chain is threaded (as seen in knotted proteins). We explored whether other proteins contain a similar intriguing knot-like structure as in leptin and discovered 11 structurally homologous proteins in the PDB. We call this new helical family class the Pierced Lasso Bundle (PLB) and the knot-like threaded structural motif a Pierced Lasso (PL). In the current study, we use structure-based simulation to investigate the threading/folding mechanisms for all the PLBs along with three unthreaded homologs as the covalent loop (or lasso) in leptin is important in folding dynamics and activity. We find {{that the presence of}} a small covalent loop leads to a mechanism where structural elements slipknot to thread through the covalent loop. Larger loops use a piercing mechanism where the <b>free</b> terminal <b>plugs</b> through the covalent loop. Remarkably, the position of the loop as well as its size influences the native state dynamics, which can impact receptor binding and biological activity. This previously unrecognized complexity of knot-like proteins within the helical bundle family comprises a completely new class within the knot family, and the hidden complexity we unraveled in the PLBs is expected to be found in other protein structures outside the four-helix bundles. The insights gained here provide critical new elements for future investigation of this emerging class of proteins, where function and the energetic landscape can be controlled by hidden topology, and should be take into account in ab initio predictions of newly identified protein targets...|$|R
40|$|Hernia repair {{is among}} the oldest and the most common {{operation}} in a surgeon’s technical armamentarium. Unfortunately, it is widely acknowledged that primary inguinal hernia repair {{will result in a}} 10 % to 15 % recurrence rate with an even higher percentage following the repair of a recurrent inguinal hernia. Numerous surgical techniques to repair inguinal hernia have been described in the literature. This includes an important advancement in the reduction of tissue tension, which was the pioneering work of Usher and associates who first reported the use of Marlex (monofilament knitted polypropylene) mesh in the repair of inguinal and incisional hernias in 1958. These surgeons utilized the mesh prosthesis to buttress and reinforce a previously sutured repair. The term “tension free” hernioplasty was first used in the literature by Liechtenstein and colleagues in 1986. The authors described a surgical technique that consisted of a suture on lay mesh patch as the primary repair. 1 This series consisted of 1000 consecutive patients followed for as long as 5 years without significant recurrence and with rapid return to full activities. The significance of this report is that the mesh prosthesis is not utilized to buttress or support a primary sutured herniorrhaphy but is the actual repair. 1 Gilbert was the first to describe the sutureless repair of inguinal hernia. 2 Rutkow presented a follow-up of 2403 patients from 1989 to 1994 for almost 6 years of tension <b>free</b> mesh <b>plug</b> herniorrhaphy with less than 1 % recurrence rate of the primary and 2 % recurrent herniorrhaphy. This procedure was associated with a minimum of postoperative complications such as urinary retention, infection involving the mesh, ischemic orchitis, vascular and embolic, long-term pain and a draining sinus tract. 4 However, though several complications have been related to the tissue tension free technique, rare complications that are secondary to the mesh migration have been reported...|$|R

For example, if you have four down lights in a room and you wish to control each light individually, then each light will be wired back using electrical cabling back to the electrical switchboard. This means you will have four electrical cables installed from the electrical switchboard to the location where the light fittings will be installed. Each cable will be a three core active, neutral and earth cable.If in that room you also have a <b>free</b> standing lamp <b>plugged</b> into a power point and you also want to control this from your automation system, you will need to have that power point individually wired back to the electrical switchboard.So if you want to individually control every light fitting and every power point or power outlets then each one of these devices must be individually wired back to the electrical switchboard. As you can see this start to become quite a lot of electrical cabling so planning is essential.|$|R

40|$|As {{requested}} by the Technical Task Request (1), a full-scale test was carried out on several different liquid-level measurement bubblers as recommended from previous testing (2). This final report incorporates photographic evidence (Appendix B) of the bubblers {{at different stages of}} testing, along with the preliminary results (Appendix C) which were previously reported (3), and instrument calibration data (Appendix D); while this report contains more detailed information than previously reported (3) the conclusions remain the same. The test was performed under highly prototypic conditions from November 26, 1996 to January 23, 1997 using the full-scale SRAT/SME tank test facilities located in the 672 -T building at TNX. Two different types of advanced bubblers were subjected to approximately 58 days of slurry operation; 14 days of which the slurry was brought to boiling temperatures. The test showed that the large diameter tube bubbler (2. 64 inches inside diameter) operated successfully throughout the 2 -month test by not plugging with the glass-frit ladened slurry which was maintained at a minimum temperature of 50 deg Cand several days of boiling temperatures. However, a weekly blow-down with air or water is recommended to minimize the slurry which builds up. The small diameter porous tube bubbler (0. 62 inch inside diameter; water flow {gt} 4 milliliters/hour = 1. 5 gallons/day) operated successfully on a daily basis in the glass-frit ladened slurry which was maintained at a minimum temperature of 50 degrees C and several days of boiling temperatures. However, a daily blow-down with air, or air and water, is necessary to maintain accurate readings. For the small diameter porous tube bubbler (0. 62 inch inside diameter; water flow {gt} 4 milliliters/hour = 1. 5 gallons/day) there were varying levels of success with the lower water-flow tubes and these tubes would have to be cleaned by blowing with air, or air and water, several times a day to maintain them <b>plug</b> <b>free.</b> This may be too labor intensive for practical use. All of the large diameter bubbler tubes tested could be readily cleaned in place by either blowing them down with justhigh pressure air or water (approx. 90 psig). While the use of both air and water produced the cleanest bubbler, using justair removed most of the slurry build-up, and the use of water resulted in basically a slurry free surface. For the smalldiameter bubbler tubes it was necessary to use high pressure air and water (approx. 90 psig) to effectively clean them. The water was only sent through the porous jacket and not introduced down the air line. However, even under these conditions there was one case where a plug was not removed when both air and water were used. Primary recommendation: The large diameter probe is the best choice since none of the three tested plugged during the 2 -mouth test period to the point which compromised liquid-level measure. However, after a week`s operation at boilingtemperatures several inches of a soft sludge builds up within the tubes. This sludge can be easily removed in place witheither high pressure air or water (approx. 90 psig). A full-scale verifi-cation test should be carried out in S-area to confirm the conclusion. Secondary recommendation: The small-diameter porous tube bubbler is recommended when an access port cannot accommodate thelarger diameter probe. Bubbler {number_sign} 1 operated accurately during most of the test period. This probe had the highest water flowrate (approx. 1. 6 gallons/day) and had the least distance from the slurry upper surface (37 inches). This probe can be made to accurately operate at lower depths if the 8 -inch-long porous tube is made longer and the water flow rate made higher. Substituting the current level and density probes (Holledge) with bubbler probes will result in a significant cost savings (inexpensive materials, less labor to manufacture, less labor to maintain, less down time due to less frequent instrument replacement) ...|$|R
40|$|Historically, {{means of}} sand control have been {{utilized}} in hydrocarbon recovery since before 1930. Guide lines for establishing a successful design and installation have been developing {{as a function}} of experience and better understanding of the properties and requirements of the reservoirs to be drained. Sand control technology has developed to meet demands for draining increasingly more difficult reservoirs, e. g. at grater depths, unstable formations and with stacked contacts. New approaches have developed and with new technology, new experiences have been gained and the key elements for success in operation and production have been updated. Gravel packing sand screens is the most demandings and control technique with regards to planning, cost and time. When other methods are found in adequate or risk and consequence of failure to prevent sanding is found unacceptable, the choice in most cases will be gravel packed sand screens. Planning well design and deducting operational parameters for open hole gravelpack (OHGP) requires involvement of experienced specialists from several disciplines. Successfully installed and producing gravel packed screens depends on all elements in the previous and following sections to be successful. Every operation contains insecurities and hence, potential for deviation from established plans. Therefore, operational phase requires close follow up. Engineering software has been developed to support the most common calculations in planning and operation. Having one application containing the most essential well data can simplify and enhance engineering support. The software can support drilling operations, but it has been specialized for horizontal gravel packing. Seamless functions - all calculations use the same source for each section: well data and work string data – enabling calculations with minimal user effort: Torque and drag Hydraulic Gravel pack calculations Gravel pack simulations combining all operational parameters Kick tolerance Well Schematic Other functions The quality and nature of the application can save time for engineering during planning and operation, especially for wells with open hole gravel pack. Planning wells that require gravel packing have some key elements that must be incorporated in the planning to ensure best chances for success. These key elements come from operational experience – what can practically done, what works and what fails. Hence, the industry use operational parameters often empirically deducted. The key elements are related to: the wellpath (trajectory), exposed formations properties, sizing of screens and gravel, gravel pack tool design, design of wash pipe (inner string), gravel pack design parameters (gravel feed, OH size, type of gravel, etc) and the properties of the drill-in fluid. The most central issue in horizontal gravel packing is the fluid velocity in the screen annulus. Most of the listed properties are there because of their influence on the fluid velocity. A robust well design must be made in the planning phase. Determining what is acceptable and not for the key elements and parameters must be acceptable for the drilling operation, production of the well and any well intervention. A well design for a typical subsea well has been discussed according to the industries practice for planning wells with OHGP. The operational parameters have been developed with the programmed application. The programmed application has been found suitable for planning and operational follow up through comparison with simulated and experienced data from 3 wells. However, several functions can be added to further develop time efficient planning and engineering support in the execution phase: Further develop intelligent routines for hydraulic calculations. Better plotting of T&D. Hydraulic: automatically incorporate gathered pressure loss data for motors and other components. Add more functions: Kick / well control calculations. Cement calculations. P&A calculations (<b>free</b> point, cement <b>plugs,</b> etc). Surge and swab. And other functions </ul...|$|R
40|$|Resin luting {{agents are}} used to lute {{indirect}} restorations to hard tooth tissues. The luting procedure consists mostly of several tooth pretreatment steps as etching, priming and application of adhesive and only {{at the very end}} applying of a resin luting agent. Such a multi-step luting procedure with separate adhesive system is quite time-consuming and technique sensitive. Therefore, constant inquiry from the practitioners for the resin luting agents with simplified application procedure, have moved the manufacturers to develop self-adhesive resin cements which require no tooth tissue pretreatment anymore. Numerous in vitro and few in vivo studies of the first self adhesive resin cement RelyX Unicem showed adequate bond strengths to hard tooth tissues and acceptable short-term clinical performance. The complex chemistry and relatively high viscosity of self-adhesive resin cements challenges the ability of them to interact with hard tooth tissues. Moreover, they interact directly with a smear layer. So, it was the question whether self-adhesive resin cements are able to create similar micromorphological adhesion pattern to resin luting agents with separate adhesive systems. We tried to answer this question with the present SEM morphological investigation. It was the aim to analyze and compare the adhesive interfaces of a control resin luting agent with self-etching primer (Panavia F and ED Primer) and adhesive interfaces of self-adhesive resin cements (RelyX Unicem, RelyX Unicem 2 and Clearfil SA Cement). The task was to find out which morphological characteristics (tags, lateral tags, hybrid layer or interdiffusion zone, pores and other) could be found in the specimens of self-adhesive resin cements, compare them on native polished, demineralized/deproteinized and fractured specimens in low vacuum mode. It was the aim to find out whether the polymerization mode has the influence on the morphological findings. At least, to clear if the present LV SEM method can be considered as appropriate method for adhesive interface examinations. It was hypothesized that the self-adhesive resin cements would have only superficial interaction with smear layer without ability to form resinous tags. This could not be confirmed because a few specimens of RelyX Unicem 2 and Clearfil SA Cement revealed the presence of tags in dentinal tubules. However, the interdiffusion zone was thin and appeared irregularly even within one SARC’s specimen. This SEM morphological study confirmed quite a weak interaction of all three SARC’s with hard tooth tissues. The weak adhesion to enamel led to microgap formation along the adhesive interface. There were more failed specimens in SARC’s experimental group than in Panavia control group. In this aspect, RelyX Unicem 2 and Clearfil SA Cement performed worse than RelyX Unicem. The micromorphology of the adhesive interface of the control luting agent Panavia and its ED Primer appeared similar to that reported in the literature for resin luting agents with self-etching adhesive systems. A good material adhesion – low number of failed specimens, no microgap formation at enamel-Panavia adhesive interface, a distinct hybrid layer, tags and lateral tags were characteristic for a dentin-Panavia adhesive interface. The demineralization/deproteinization and fracturing of specimens revealed some characteristics extra like lateral tags and complemented the information obtained from polished specimens. It was hypothesized that auto-polymerization would enhance the deeper diffusion of the luting agents and thicker interdiffusion zone could be detected. Specimen examinations showed insignificant differences of morphological findings. Although, tags were found mostly in auto-curing mode, the supposed thicker interdiffusion zone in auto-polymerized self-adhesive resin cement specimens was not present. Possibly the tags in Clearfil SA Cement and RelyX Unicem 2 specimens could be formed there, where the dentinal tubules were <b>free</b> of smear <b>plugs.</b> By contrast, ED Primer of Panavia has modified the smear plugs allowing resin to infiltrate into dentinal tubules in both curing modes, however, without influence on the thickness of the hybrid layer. Using low vacuum SEM method it was possible to depict the characteristic adhesive interface of native, minimally prepared specimens. In particular, material contrast in LV SEM allowed features to be revealed such as the interdiffusion zone (hybrid layer) or tags. Self-adhesive resin cements have shown less typical micromophological characteristics at adhesive interface when compared to a control resin luting agent in the present study. It can be concluded that self-adhesive resin cements have predominantly chemical interaction with smear layer. Although, the bond strength of self-adhesive resin cements in vitro studies is acceptable, for lasting clinical performance a combination of chemical and micromechanical adhesion with a formation of tags and sufficient interdiffusion zone would be more trustworthy. ...|$|R
