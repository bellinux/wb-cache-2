5|$|Two calamities in {{the autumn}} of 1906 shocked African Americans, and they contributed to {{strengthening}} support for Du Bois's struggle for civil rights to prevail over Booker T. Washington's accommodationism. First, President Teddy Roosevelt dishonorably discharged 167 black soldiers because they were accused of crimes {{as a result of the}} Brownsville Affair. Many of the discharged soldiers had served for 20 years and were near retirement. Second, in September, riots broke out in Atlanta, precipitated by unfounded allegations of black men assaulting white women. This was a catalyst for racial tensions based on a job shortage and employers playing black workers against white workers. Ten thousand whites rampaged through Atlanta, beating <b>every</b> <b>black</b> person they could find, resulting in over 25 deaths. In the aftermath of the 1906 violence, Du Bois urged blacks to withdraw their support from the Republican Party, because Republicans Roosevelt and William Howard Taft did not sufficiently support blacks. Most African Americans had been loyal to the Republican Party since the time of Abraham Lincoln.|$|E
25|$|When an 8-year-old {{girl was}} raped in March 1998, the police {{initially}} described two black males as the culprits. Lee {{was criticized for}} declaring <b>every</b> <b>black</b> man in the subdivision a suspect. He apologized for any offense but insisted the practice was not racist. In fact, friends said the sheriff was so personally shaken by the vicious attack on the girl, who was also black, that he pulled {{out all the stops}} to solve the case.|$|E
25|$|Both {{black and}} white women were {{involved}} in creating the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909 and were often involved {{in much of the}} organization's local work. By 1900, almost <b>every</b> <b>black</b> community had a women's club. By 1910, in proportion to population size, African-American women's clubs outpaced white women's clubs in the number of clubs created. By 1914, the NACW had fifty-thousand members and over a thousand clubs participating in the umbrella organization. Black women wanted to be visible and NACW helped them organize to improve conditions in their communities. There were also many African-American versions of the WCTU and the YWCA.|$|E

500|$|Angelou {{uses her}} {{autobiography}} to explore {{subjects such as}} identity, rape, racism, and literacy. She also writes in new ways about women's lives in a male-dominated society. Maya, the younger version of Angelou and the book's central character, has been called [...] "a symbolic character for <b>every</b> <b>black</b> girl growing up in America". Angelou's description of being raped as an eight-year-old child overwhelms the book, although it is presented briefly in the text. Another metaphor, that of a bird struggling to escape its cage, is a central image throughout the work, which consists of [...] "a sequence of lessons about resisting racist oppression". Angelou's treatment of racism provides a thematic unity to the book. Literacy {{and the power of}} words help young Maya cope with her bewildering world; books become her refuge as she works through her trauma.|$|E
500|$|In {{the course}} of Caged Bird, Maya, who has been {{described}} as [...] "a symbolic character for <b>every</b> <b>black</b> girl growing up in America", goes from being a victim of racism with an inferiority complex to a self-aware individual who responds to racism with dignity and a strong sense of her own identity. Feminist scholar Maria Lauret states that the [...] "formation of female cultural identity" [...] is woven into the book's narrative, setting Maya up as [...] "a role model for Black women". [...] Scholar Liliane Arensberg calls this presentation Angelou's [...] "identity theme" [...] and a major motif in Angelou's narrative. [...] Maya's unsettled life in Caged Bird suggests her sense of self [...] "as perpetually in the process of becoming, of dying and being reborn, in all its ramifications". African-American literature scholar Dolly McPherson agrees, stating that Angelou creatively uses Christian mythology and theology to present the Biblical themes of death, regeneration, and rebirth.|$|E
500|$|The {{persistence}} of such attitudes {{was fueled by}} resentment {{over the fact that}} Presley, whose musical and visual performance idiom owed much to African American sources, achieved the cultural acknowledgement and commercial success largely denied his black peers. Into the 21st century, the notion that Presley had [...] "stolen" [...] black music still found adherents. Notable among African American entertainers expressly rejecting this view was Jackie Wilson, who argued, [...] "A lot of people have accused Elvis of stealing the black man's music, when in fact, almost <b>every</b> <b>black</b> solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from Elvis." [...] And throughout his career, Presley plainly acknowledged his debt. Addressing his '68 Comeback Special audience, he said, [...] "Rock 'n' roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues, or it sprang from that. People have been adding to it, adding instruments to it, experimenting with it, but it all boils down to [...]" [...] Nine years earlier, he had said, [...] "Rock 'n' roll has been around for many years.

[...] In late January 2015, Butters and Fazekas revealed that Underwood is a product of the precursor to the Black Widow program. Regan did not know the character was a Black Widow when auditioning, but quickly learned after being cast, as the showrunners wanted her to change her then current red hair, in order to avoid being [...] "a tip to the audience, because of Natasha [...] They didn’t want to imply that <b>every</b> <b>Black</b> Widow had red hair and they didn’t want the audience to see it coming." [...] Regan trained with a Tae Kwan Do expert and studied Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow choreography from the films in preparation for the character's fight scenes, while Ottobre-Melton referenced her Black Widow status by using the colors red and black. Underwood's initial [...] "small-town girl from Iowa" [...] persona was based on Judy Garland's Dorothy Gale from The Wizard of Oz.|$|E
500|$|When Jam and Lewis {{agreed to}} produce Jackson's third studio album, {{they wanted to}} appeal {{primarily}} to the African American community, in addition to achieving crossover success on the pop music charts. Jam commented {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone magazine, [...] "We wanted to do an album that would be in <b>every</b> <b>black</b> home in America... we were going for the black album of all time." [...] Before their association with Jackson, Jam and Lewis had originally planned to record an album with tracks they wrote for Sharon Bryant, but she found their lyrics and sound to be too [...] "rambunctious". The duo presented the same set of recordings to Jackson, who gave her input and took co-writing and co-production credits for the album's content. Jam and Lewis recalled that in order to collaborate with Jackson on the material, they spent the first week simply getting to know their new client. Lewis explained, [...] "We got into her head. We saw what she was capable of, what she wanted to say, where she wanted to be, what she wanted to be. We put together some songs to fit her as we saw her, as she revealed herself to us. It was as simple as that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Above {{the grid}} is a {{distance}} bar scale, notched with sub-units. There are {{two sets of}} numbers on the scale, one for measuring each grid square by 20 miles, another for measuring each grid square by 100 miles (see diagram). [...] The top bar is the 20m-per-square scale, with <b>every</b> <b>black</b> dot denoting one mile. [...] The bottom bar is the 100m-per-square scale, where {{the length of a}} unit square is divided into two equal 50m sub-squares, and a set of dots and red lines break it down further into lengths of 10 miles. [...] So depending on which scale one chooses, the length of the side of the entire grid (eight squares) could be measured up to 160 miles (using the 20m-per-square scale) or up to 800 miles (using the 100m-per-square scale).|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, {{the actual}} targets were chosen from a far broader group than {{the titles of}} the {{programs}} would imply. The CPUSA program targeted not only Communist Party members but also sponsors of the National Committee to Abolish the House Un-American Activities Committee and civil rights leaders allegedly under Communist influence or deemed to be not sufficiently [...] "anti-Communist". The Socialist Workers Party program included non-SWP sponsors of anti-war demonstrations which were cosponsored by the SWP or the Young Socialist Alliance, its youth group. The Black Nationalist program targeted a range of organizations from the Panthers to SNCC to the peaceful Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and included <b>every</b> <b>Black</b> Student Union and many other black student groups. New Left targets ranged from the SDS to the InterUniversity Committee for Debate on Foreign Policy, from Antioch College ("vanguard of the New Left") to the New Mexico Free University and other [...] "alternate" [...] schools, and from underground newspapers to students' protesting university censorship of a student publication by carrying signs with four-letter words on them.|$|E

Harry Belafonte, a folk singer who recently had introduced Calypso music to a mainstream audience, {{had only one}} film to his credit, but he had just won the Tony Award and Theatre World Award for his performance in John Murray Anderson's Almanac, and Preminger cast him as Joe. Pearl Bailey's sole screen credit was the 1948 film Isn't It Romantic?, but she had achieved success as a band singer and was familiar to television audiences from her appearances on Your Show of Shows, so she was assigned the role of Frankie. Joe Adams was a Los Angeles disc jockey with no acting experience, but Preminger felt {{he had the right}} look for Husky. Diahann Carroll auditioned for the title role, but she was so terrified of the director she could barely focus on the scene, and Preminger cast her in the small supporting role of Myrt instead. Finally, <b>every</b> <b>black</b> actress from Eartha Kitt to Joyce Bryant was tested for the role of Carmen.|$|E
2500|$|His real {{problems}} {{came from the}} Democratic efforts to undo Reconstruction and gain control. Democrats in Vicksburg launched a coup in December 1874; when the sheriff called on his supporters to restore him to office, there was a battle that ended in a massacre of black Republicans. Ames had no forces to send, and depended on the national government for troops to reinstate the ousted officials. In the months that followed, he failed to mobilize a state militia to cope with renewed troubles. By that August, the Democratic Party had united to carry the legislative elections that fall, and carried out {{what came to be}} called the [...] "Mississippi Plan." [...] A riot in Yazoo county drove out the Republican sheriff and resulted in some black people and party officers being lynched. Another at Clinton on September 4 ended with white Democratic paramilitaries riding over the county shooting any and <b>every</b> <b>black</b> person they chanced upon. With no other means of protection, Governor Ames appealed to the federal government for assistance. It was not refused, but authorities urged him to exhaust state resources first.|$|E

They encounter a con man named Simple Savior, a phony revolutionary leader who claims to be the cousin of [...] "Black Jesus", and that he gives his followers [...] "the strength to kill whites". In a flashy stage performance in his [...] "church", Savior acts out being brutalized by symbols of black oppression—represented by images of John Wayne, Elvis Presley, and Richard Nixon, before asking his parishioners for [...] "donations". Rabbit and his friends quickly realize Savior's [...] "revolution" [...] is merely a money making scam. Rabbit openly steals {{a large portion of the}} donation money, prompting Savior to try to have him killed. After Rabbit tricks his would-be murderers (in a paraphrasing of the story of Br'er Rabbit and the briar patch), he and Bear kill Savior. This allows Rabbit to take over Savior's racket, putting him in line to become the head of all organized crime in Harlem. Rabbit lays out his plan to keep all organized crime money in Harlem. But first, he has to get rid of a few other opponents. Savior's former partners tell Rabbit they will join him but only if he can kill his opponents, otherwise they will kill him instead.|$|E

2500|$|The film further {{reinforced}} the popular picture held by whites, {{especially in the}} South, of Reconstruction as a disaster. In his 1929 book The Tragic Era: The Revolution After Lincoln, the respected historian Claude Bowers treated The Birth of a Nation as a factually accurate account of Reconstruction. In The Tragic Era, Bowers presented <b>every</b> <b>black</b> politician in the South as corrupt, portrayed Republican Representative Thaddeus Stevens as a vicious [...] "race traitor" [...] intent upon making blacks the equal of whites, and praised the Klan for [...] "saving civilization" [...] in the South. Bowers wrote about black empowerment that the worse sort of [...] "scum" [...] from the North like Stevens [...] "inflamed the Negro's egoism and soon the lustful assaults began. Rape was the foul daughter of Reconstruction!". The American historian John Hope Franklin wrote {{that not only did}} Bowers treat The Birth of a Nation as accurate history, but his version of history seemed to be drawn from The Birth of a Nation. Some historians, such as E. Merton Coulter in his The South Under Reconstruction (1947), maintained the Dunning School view after World War II. Today, the Dunning School position is largely seen as a product of anti-black racism of the early 20th century, by which many Americans held that black Americans were unequal as citizens. Coulter in The South During Reconstruction, which again treated The Birth of a Nation as historically correct, and painted a vivid picture of [...] "black beasts" [...] running amok, encouraged by alcohol-sodden, corrupt and vengeful black Republican politicians. Franklin wrote that as recently as the 1970s that the popular journalist Alistair Cooke in his books and TV shows was still essentially following the version of history set out by The Birth of a Nation, noting that Cooke had much sympathy with the suffering of whites in Reconstruction while having almost nothing to say about the suffering of blacks or about how African-Americans were stripped of almost all their rights after 1877.|$|E
