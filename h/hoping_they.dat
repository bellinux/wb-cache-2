5|$|The loss of Gibraltar {{led to the}} {{deposition}} of the Nasrid sultan of Granada by his brother Nasr, who quickly reversed policy, abandoned the rebels in Ceuta and gave Algeciras (and thus the claim on Gibraltar) to the Marinids in 1310, {{as part of a}} new treaty, <b>hoping</b> <b>they</b> might recover it. But too busy elsewhere for any entanglements in Spain, the Marinids gave Algeciras back to Granada almost immediately after. The Granadans launched an attempt to recover Gibraltar by themselves in 1315, but without Marinid support, the Second Siege of Gibraltar faltered and failed.|$|E

5|$|Alan Grant, {{a writer}} from Scotland, {{got his start}} on 2000 AD as an {{assistant}} writer for John Wagner. Grant rose to prominence as an equal of Wagner's {{in the creation of}} Judge Dredd comic strips. These stories were noted favorably for their use of socio-political commentary and satire. Together, the duo acquired employment with DC Comics. Dennis O'Neil assigned them to Detective Comics in 1988, <b>hoping</b> <b>they</b> would bring their gritty, violent take on Judge Dredd to Batman storylines. Soon after, Wagner left the company, leaving Grant to continue the run on his own. Drawing on his work for Judge Dredd, Grant began injecting social commentary into the comic book, and avoided using common Batman rogues in favor of his own creations. Some of these villains were influenced by characters from the Judge Dredd universe. Anarky was conceived singularly by Grant {{as a result of these}} circumstances, and Grant's own intellectual and philosophical meditations influenced the portrayal of the character over the following years.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, NSB {{announced}} {{that they wanted to}} discontinue their operations in Narvik, <b>hoping</b> <b>they</b> could leave operation of passenger trains on the Ofot Line to Ofotbanen. In May, NSB signed an agreement with Ofotbanen, where the latter would take over NSB's responsibilities to operate trains from Narvik to Riksgränsen along the Ofot Line. The initial contract would last until 2006, and NSB paid NOK 13 million for the service. From 15 June, Ofotbanen took over all passenger transport on the line, including employing all former NSB employees in Narvik. On the same day, Connex Tåg took over the operations on the Swedish side of the border after winning a public service obligation contract with the Swedish government, and dismissing SJ of the right to offer the service.

5|$|Originally, {{the story}} of a woman {{separated}} from her husband when the plane crashes was going to be used for Kate, but when Kate's role in the series changed the producers kept that story for Rose. Much of the couple's story prior to the plane crash was based on the events of Caldwell's life; she married her husband even though he was dying. Due to Caldwell and Anderson having other acting commitments, the writers found it difficult finding time when both actors could appear together in the show, resulting in neither character featuring in most of season three. Critics reacted positively to the couple, often <b>hoping</b> <b>they</b> would appear more frequently, and both actors were praised for their work.|$|E
