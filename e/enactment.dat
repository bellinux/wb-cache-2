Mere brandishing of a weapon against a state official was to be punished by life imprisonment. Wounding a state official would be punished by decapitation, killing of state official by cutting of hand followed by decapitation. Another 1754 <b>enactment</b> limited possibility of shooting within limits of certain cities to licensed shooting ranges, showing early development of sport shooting in the country.|$|E

5|$|Canon law {{concerns}} the Catholic Church's life and organisation and {{is distinct from}} civil law. In its own field it gives force to civil law only by specific <b>enactment</b> in matters such as the guardianship of minors. Similarly, civil law may give force in its field to canon law, but only by specific <b>enactment,</b> as with regard to canonical marriages. Currently, the 1983 Code of Canon Law is in effect primarily for the Latin Church. The distinct 1990 Code of Canons for the Eastern Churches (CCEO, after the Latin initials) applies to the autonomous Eastern Catholic Churches.|$|E
5|$|Hebden was a {{township}} in {{the parish}} of Linton, part of the east division of the wapentake of Staincliffe and Ewcross in the historic county of the West Riding of Yorkshire. It became a separate civil parish in Skipton Rural District in 1866 {{as a result of}} the <b>enactment</b> of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1866. In 1974 it was transferred to Craven District in North Yorkshire as the result of the <b>enactment</b> of the Local Government Act 1972.|$|E

5000|$|Upon {{returning}} to Sana’a, the Chief Rabbis, led by R. Shelomo Manzeli and Yiḥya Halevi (called Alsheikh), {{came together in}} the newly built Alsheikh synagogue and decided {{to put in place}} a series of <b>enactments</b> meant at bettering the spiritual condition of the community, and which they hoped would prevent the recurrence of such harsh decrees against the Jewish community in the future. [...] These <b>enactments</b> were transcribed in a document entitled Iggereth Ha-Besoroth (Letter of Tidings), and which was believed to have been disseminated amongst the community at large. Only excerpts of the letter have survived. The <b>enactments</b> called out for a more strict observance of certain laws which, heretofore, had been observed with leniency. Such strictures were to be incumbent upon the entire community and which, in the Rabbis’ estimation, would have given to the community some merit in the face of oppression or persecution. Not all of these <b>enactments,</b> however, were upheld by the community, since some <b>enactments</b> were seen as breaking-away from tradition.|$|R

5|$|The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher {{grades were}} based on four {{separate}} enactments. The first <b>enactment</b> Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 1573 of 1 September 1939 instituted the Iron Cross (Eisernes Kreuz) and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. As the war progressed, some of the recipients distinguished themselves further and a higher grade, the Oak Leaves to Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, was instituted. The Oak Leaves, as they were commonly referred to, {{were based on}} the <b>enactment</b> Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 849 of 3 June 1940. In 1941, two higher grades of the Knight's Cross were instituted. The <b>enactment</b> Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 613 of 28 September 1941 introduced the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds. At the end of 1944 the final grade, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit goldenem Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten), based on the <b>enactment</b> Reichsgesetzblatt 1945 I S. 11 of 29 December 1944, concluded the variants of the Knight's Cross.|$|E

40|$|Khalwat {{is one of}} Syariah {{criminal}} offences that is prescribed under Syariah criminal offence <b>enactments</b> in Malaysia. The issue before hand {{is that there are}} distintive definitions given by the Islamic jurist as well as definitons laid down in Syariah legislations of Malaysia. This article aims to discuss the definition of khalwat according to Islamic perspective in which it is not in pari materia with the interpretations from the state <b>enactments</b> in Malaysia. Furthermore, the discussion will be based on the category of khalwat that profounded from the Al Quran and Al-Hadith. This discussion also will be focusing more on the various interpretation of khalwat according to state <b>enactments</b> of Malaysia.

The study found that there are differences in khalwat interpretation in the legal provision of the Syariah criminal <b>enactments</b> of Malaysia. Despite the differences in the interpretation, khalwat could still be regarded as a bona fide Shariah criminal offence in Malaysia...|$|R
