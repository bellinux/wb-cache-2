50|$|I {{went for}} the crux, the motion startling me like a car {{unexpectedly}} in gear in a crowded parking lot. I swarm through the roundness of the bulge to a crank on a brittle spike for a cluster of three crystals on the right; each finger crucial and separate like the keys for a piano chord. I change feet three times to rest my lower legs, each time having to jump my foot out to put the other in. The finger-holds are too poor to hang on should the toes catch on each other. All those foot-changing mistakes on easy moves by runners come to mind. There is no resting. I must go and climb for the top. I swarm up towards the sunlight, gasping for air. A brittle <b>hold</b> <b>stays</b> under mistreatment and then I really blow it. Fearful of a smear on now-non-sticky boots I use an edge and move up, a fall fatal, but the automaton stabs back through, wobbling, but giving its all and I grasp a large sidepull and tube upward. The ropes dangle uselessly from my waist. Arthur Birtwhistle on Diagonal, I grasp incuts and the tight movement swerves to a glide as gravity swings skyward.|$|R

After Nadal's relentless onslaught on Federer's backhand {{for the better part}} of four hours, it finally broke down as the clock struck midnight in Melbourne. Serving at 3-1, Nadal raced ahead to a 40-0 lead. Federer fought back to 40-30 but Nadal got the <b>hold</b> to <b>stay</b> ahead 4-1. Federer then held at love to get back to 4-2.

5000|$|The {{status of}} the Bishopric of Poznań of Bishop Unger, whose diocese had also {{comprised}} Gniezno before and who had not supported {{the creation of a}} separate archdiocese in Gniezno, is also subject to historical debate.

However, generally, the congress is seen as having established complete ecclasiastical independence of the Polish church from Magdeburg.|$|R

50|$|When play resumed, Nadal quickly {{fell behind}} {{again in his}} service game 15-40. Federer hit a {{forehand}} long at 30-40 to keep Nadal {{in the game and}} reach deuce. The ball was clearly out but Federer used a strategic Hawkeye challenge on the call in an attempt to rattle Nadal. Nadal then lost the next point at 40-40, which he too strategically challenged to no avail. Federer then gained another break point after the ruling, his sixth break chance in the set. Nadal saved it with a forehand winner and went on to <b>hold</b> and <b>stay</b> ahead 6-5. Nadal fought hard in the next game to break. Federer saved a set point and needed three deuces to finally hold for 6-6. The tiebreak went to 3-3 where Federer shanked a forehand to give Nadal a mini-break. Nadal then hit two winners to go ahead 6-3 and found himself with three set points. Federer double faulted to end the 78-minute set and Nadal went ahead two-sets-to-one.|$|R

There are several possibilities as to exactly which city this was, including Hebron, south of Jerusalem, and Ein Karem.

[...] Mary stayed three months, and most scholars <b>hold</b> she <b>stayed</b> {{for the birth of}} John. Given the prevailing cultural traditions and needs for security etc., it is probable that Joseph accompanied Mary to Judah then returned to Nazareth, and came again after three months to take his wife home. The apparition of the angel, mentioned in Matthew 1:19-25, may have taken place then to end the tormenting doubts of Joseph regarding Mary's maternity.|$|R

50|$|For {{over four}} decades, Biddle shot films of dinghy races, Tall Ships events and {{everything}} in between.
