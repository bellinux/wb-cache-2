40|$|Pregnant female mice, after intravaginal {{inoculation}} with Herpesvirus hominis (HVH) type 2, developed vaginitis on days 5 to 7 after virus challenge, {{followed by}} hunching and hind limb paralysis on days 7 to 9 and death from encephalitis on days 9 to 11. After initial replication in the mucous membranes of the genital tract, virus {{spread to the}} spinal cord and ascended to involve the brain. Viremia or replication of H. hominis type 2 in the liver or spleen was not detected. Virus was cleared from vaginal secretions by days 8 to 10 after infection. Pregnant mice were more susceptible to the infection than nonpregnant mice. This experimental infection in female mice provides a model for genital herpesvirus infection and for herpesvirus infection and for <b>herpesvirus</b> <b>encephalitis</b> in which one can evaluate potentially promising antiviral chemotherapeutic agents...|$|E
40|$|Primary {{herpesvirus}} infection usually {{occurs during}} childhood and may cause several benign self-limited clinical manifestations, {{followed by a}} life-long persistence in a latent state with possible reactivation in case of immunodeficiency. Serious health problems, including CNS lesions can occur {{as a result of}} HVs reactivation. <b>Herpesvirus</b> <b>encephalitis</b> (HVE) accounts for up to 40 % of all viral encephalitis, and are major causes of mortality and long-term neurological sequelae throughout the world even when using antiviral drugs. Since surveillance and recording of herpesvirus infections (HVI) are not common practice, it is difficult to establish exact figures for the prevalence of both HVI and HVE. Despite being an important public health problem, very few population-based studies have been carried out so far in the world and none in Ukraine. We present the clinical and etiological data obtained in prospective single center population study with 107 enrolled adult patients in Ukraine...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Herpesvirus</b> <b>encephalitis</b> (HVE) is {{a serious}} threat to people's health and life. The most common cause of these is herpes simplex virus. On the contrary, only {{isolated}} cases of encephalitis associated with herpesvirus type 7 are described. Objective: To describe a case of acute encephalitis in a young adult caused by uncommon Human herpesvirus 7 (HHV- 7), underlying with Herpes simplex virus 1 / 2 (HSV- 1 / 2) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) coinfection. Results: A 20 -years-old woman presented to The Center of Infectious Disorders of the Nervous System (Kyiv, Ukraine) after developing acute fever followed by a left side partial loss of hearing. Her physical examination showed slow mentation and generalized weakness. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed pleocytosis of 15 cell/µl (45 % lymphocytes, 55 % granulocytes), and HHV- 7 DNA (3. 35 log genome copies per ml). CSF also contained IgG antibodies against HSV- 1 / 2 and EBV capsid antigen (CA). No HHVs DNA nor antibodies to viral proteins were detected in the blood. Areas of mild increased signal in parietal lobes were detected on an MRI brain scan. After treating with Ganciclovir the patient was discharged in good condition. Conclusion: The author presents a case of primary HHV- 7 infection followed acute encephalitis with typical MRI findings and HHV- 7 DNA in CSF PCR. Ganciclovir therapy results in complete virology and neurological recovery. This case may be useful for clinicians in the differential diagnosis of CNS infection, taking into account that HHV- 7 may be an etiological factor, and a timely diagnosis is the most important imperative for successful treatment...|$|E

40|$|A {{reproducible}} microbiologic assay of microgram {{quantities of}} idoxuridine (IDU) in serum, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid is presented. The antiviral assay is not interfered with by type-specific antibody or interferon. During slow intravenous infusions of idox-uridine (4 mg/min) {{in patients with}} suspected diagnoses of <b>Herpesvirus</b> hominis <b>encephalitis,</b> the rate of inactivation and/or removal of drug exceeded its administration. During several rapid infusions of idoxuridine (50 mg/min) significant quantities of the drug were found in serum, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid. Idoxuridine is not significantly bound to serum proteins and is not deiodinated in fresh serum or urine in vitro to inactive products (iodouracil, uracil, iodide). It is rapidly excreted into the urine. Inactivation of IDU occurs in tissues. This antiviral assay of IDU in body fluids should be applicable to other viruses and potential antiviral agents...|$|R

40|$|Components of {{herpes simplex}} virus {{remained}} bound to the diploid cell membrane after nucleocapsid penetration into the cytosol. These components enabled the infected cells to induce interferon-alpha (IFN-~) in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} even when the infected cells were fixed by glutaraldehyde. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the major viral glycoprotein D could neutralize their IFN-~-indueing capacity. Thus, the process of IFN induction does not require uptake and penetration of the inducer into the effector cells. The process was, however, sensitive to lysosomotropic drugs. These data suggest that a membrane receptor is involved in the IFN- ~ induction mechanism. In vivo, interferon-alpha (IFN-c 0 is produced early during systemic or localized {{herpes simplex virus}} types 1 and 2 (HSV- 1 or HSV- 2) infections. It is synthesized in the cerebrospinal fluid and brain of patients at the onset of <b>herpesvirus</b> <b>encephalitis</b> (Lebon et al., 1979; Legapsi et al., 1980; Hilfenhaus & Ackerman, 1981; Vezinet et al., 1981; Hamano et al., 1983), in the blood of newborn infants (Catalano et al., 1971; Dussaix et al., 1985) and in the fluid of cutaneous vesicles (Overall et al., 1981). In vivo and in vitro I F N-c ~ is mainly released from leukocytes independently of their immune status. The population of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) involved in the synthesis of pH 2 -resistant IFN- ~ induced by herpesvirus was identified as being non-T, non-B lymphocytes (Kirchner et al., 1979). They carry the antigenic markers, D 44 and Ia, but not OKMI (Lebon et aL, 1982 a; Abb et al., 1983), and represent probably less than 1 ~ of the PBMC. The protein components of this DNA virus have been thought to be responsible for IFN-~ induction. Indeed, IFN- ~ has been obtained after interaction of PBMC with non-infectious virus preparations, such as heat-inactivated virus (Haahr et al., 1976), u. v. -inactivated viru...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} therapeutic {{effects of}} vidarabine (9 -beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine), cyclaradine (the adenosine deaminase-resistant carbocyclic analog of vidarabine), and cyclaradine- 5 '-methoxyacetate in the parenteral treatment of systemic {{herpes simplex virus}} type 1 infections in Swiss mice were determined. Among control mice inoculated intraperitoneally with virus, a mortality rate of 95 % was observed. The intraperitoneal administration of nontoxic doses of vidarabine (125 to 250 mg/kg per day) or cyclaradine (113 to 450 mg/kg per day), by daily injections for 7 days beginning 4 h after virus inoculation, reduced mortality to 0 to 10 %. Among control animals inoculated intracerebrally with 32 50 % lethal doses of virus, 100 % mortality was observed, with a mean survival time of 4. 6 days. Treatment with either drug at equimolar dose levels ranging from ca. 32 to 750 mg/kg per day produced significant (P less than 0. 0005), dose-dependent increases in the mean survival time of animals dying of <b>herpesvirus</b> <b>encephalitis.</b> Mice inoculated intracerebrally with 10 50 % lethal doses of virus exhibited 97 % mortality and a mean survival time of 5. 5 to 6. 4 days. Treatment with vidarabine, cyclaradine, or cyclaradine- 5 '-methoxyacetate significantly increased the mean survival time of dying animals and, at doses ranging from 250 to 750 mg/kg per day, produced significant increases in survival. The three drugs displayed equivalent antiviral efficacy in vivo. Drug toxicity (measured by weight loss) was not detected in mice treated with cyclaradine or cyclaradine- 5 '-methoxyacetate at 750 mg/kg per day, whereas severe toxicity (weight loss of {{greater than or equal}} to 3 g) was observed in mice treated with vidarabine at an equivalent dose level. Thus, cyclaradine or its 5 '-methoxyacetic acid ester may possess some advantage over vidarabine in the treatment of severe herpesvirus infections and should therefore be considered for clinical trials in humans...|$|E
40|$|Humoral {{immunity}} {{is maintained}} by long-lived plasma cells, constitutively secreting antibodies, and nonsecreting resting memory B {{cells that are}} rapidly reactivated upon antigen encounter. The activation requirements for resting memory B cells, particularly the role of T helper cells, are unclear. To analyze the activation of memory B cells, mice were immunized with human cytomegalovirus, a complex human <b>herpesvirus,</b> and tick-born <b>encephalitis</b> virus, and a simple flavivirus. B cell populations devoid of Ig-secreting plasma cells were adoptively transferred into T and B cell–deficient RAG- 1 �/ � mice. Antigenic stimulation 4 – 6 d after transfer of B cells resulted in rapid IgG production. The response was long lasting and strictly antigen specific, excluding polyclonal B cell activation. CD 4 � T cells were not involved since (a) further depletion of CD 4 � T cells in the recipient mice did not alter the antibody response and (b) recipient mice contained no detectable CD 4 � T cells 90 d posttransfer. Memory B cells could not be activated by a soluble viral protein without T cell help. Transfer of memory B cells into immunocompetent animals indicated that presence of helper T cells did not enhance the memory B cell response. Therefore, our results indicate that activation of virus-specific memory B cells to secrete IgG is independent of cognate or bystander T cell help.
