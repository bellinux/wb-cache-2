25|$|X-15 Flight 3-65-97, a NASA {{test flight}} piloted by Michael J. Adams, on 15 November 1967. Adams {{was killed when}} an <b>electrical</b> <b>disturbance</b> caused the {{degradation}} of flight controls in his North American X-15 upon ascent. At 230,000 feet, the X-15 entered a Mach 5 spin. Adams used the minimal manual controls he had along with backup controls to attempt an emergency landing at Rogers Dry Lake, but only served to throw the aircraft into a pilot induced oscillation and a Mach 3.93 inverted dive. The plane began to break up 10 minutes and 35 seconds after takeoff, destroying the X-15 and killing Adams instantly.|$|E

60|$|The storm {{which was}} coming was already making itself manifest, {{not only in}} the wide scope of nature, but in the hearts and natures of human beings. <b>Electrical</b> <b>disturbance</b> in the sky and the air is {{reproduced}} in animals of all kinds, and particularly in the highest type of them all--the most receptive--the most electrical. So it was with Edgar Caswall, despite his selfish nature and coldness of blood. So it was with Mimi Salton, despite her unselfish, unchanging devotion for those she loved. So it was even with Lady Arabella, who, under the instincts of a primeval serpent, carried the ever-varying wishes and customs of womanhood, which is always old--and always new.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{we come to}} the conclusion, strange {{at first}} sight, that the MATTER constituting the living world is {{identical}} with that which forms the inorganic world. And not less true is it that, remarkable as are the powers or, in other words, as are the FORCES which are exerted by living beings, yet all these forces are either identical with those which exist in the inorganic world, or they are convertible into them; I mean in just the same sense as the researches of physical philosophers have shown that heat is convertible into electricity, that electricity is convertible into magnetism, magnetism into mechanical force or chemical force, and any one of them with the other, each being measurable in terms of the other,--even so, I say, that great law is applicable to the living world. Consider why is the skeleton of this horse capable of supporting the masses of flesh and the various organs forming the living body, unless it is because of the action of the same forces of cohesion which combines together the particles of matter composing this piece of chalk? What is there in the muscular contractile power of the animal but the force which is expressible, and which is in a certain sense convertible, into the force of gravity which it overcomes? Or, if you go to more hidden processes, in what does the process of digestion differ from those processes which are carried on in the laboratory of the chemist? Even if we take the most recondite and most complex operations of animal life--those of the nervous system, these of late years have been shown to be--I do not say identical in any sense with the electrical processes--but this has been shown, that they are in some way or other associated with them; that is to say, that every amount of nervous action is accompanied by a certain amount of <b>electrical</b> <b>disturbance</b> in the particles of the nerves in which that nervous action is carried on. In this way the nervous action is related to electricity {{in the same way that}} heat is related to electricity; and the same sort of argument which demonstrates the two latter to be related to one another shows that the nervous forces are correlated to electricity; for the experiments of M. Dubois Reymond and others have shown that whenever a nerve is in a state of excitement, sending a message to the muscles or conveying an impression to the brain, there is a disturbance of the electrical condition of that nerve which does not exist at other times; and there are a number of other facts and phenomena of that sort; so that {{we come to the}} broad conclusion that not only as to living matter itself, but as to the forces that matter exerts, there is a close relationship between the organic and the inorganic world--the difference between them arising from the diverse combination and disposition of identical forces, and not from any primary diversity, so far as we can see.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{improved}} detection scheme for a two-wave mixing interferometer with a Bi 12 SiO 20 crystal. The proposed detection scheme allows quasi-balanced detection of ultrasonic signals whereby <b>electrical</b> <b>disturbances</b> are suppressed. Quasi-balancing {{is achieved by}} changing the polarity of the high voltage at the photorefractive crystal, leading to an inversion of the optical interference signal, in combination with inversion of the detector signal using a signal inverter before the data acquisition device. The polarity of the high voltage is changed by utilizing an H-bridge consisting of five high-voltage relays. Microcontrollers are used to synchronize the reversion of the high voltage at the photorefractive crystal and the inversion of the measured signals. We demonstrate remote measurement of ultrasonic waves and shown that <b>electrical</b> <b>disturbances</b> are suppressed using the quasi-balanced mode...|$|R
40|$|An {{approach}} {{to predict the}} susceptibility of digital systems to signal <b>disturbances</b> is described. <b>Electrical</b> <b>disturbances</b> on a digital system's input and output lines can be induced by activities and conditions including static electricity, lightning discharge, electromagnetic interference (EMI), and electromagnetic pulsation (EMP). The <b>electrical</b> signal <b>disturbances</b> employed for the susceptibility study were limited to nondestructive levels, i. e., the system does not sustain partial or total physical damage and reset and/or reload brings the system to an operational status. The front-end transition from the <b>electrical</b> <b>disturbances</b> to the equivalent digital signals was accomplished by computer-aided circuit analysis. The super-sceptre (system for circuit evaluation of transient radiation effects) programs was used. Gate models were developed according to manufacturers' performance specifications and parameters resulting from construction processes characteristic of the technology.

40|$|Abstract- Power {{generation}} {{in a nuclear}} plant {{is dependent on the}} Nuclear steam supply system (thermal energy source), the turbine generator (energy conversion), the circulating water system (heat rejection) and condensate/feed water system (regenerative heat and recycle of working fluid) and the plant electric system supporting these. These power generation processes must be operated so as to maintain energy and mass balance under changing conditions of load and environment. Grid <b>electrical</b> <b>disturbances</b> cause significant deviations in grid supply voltage and frequency. The abnormal conditions that accompany the imposition of grid <b>electrical</b> <b>disturbances</b> on a nuclear plant can disrupt the dynamic state of process systems equilibrium. The impact of grid <b>electrical</b> <b>disturbances</b> are in two different ways viz. (i) process degradation and (ii) impact on electrical components. Analysis of both these aspects are required to be carried out to design efficient reactor system high plant availability. In this project, effect of change in grid frequency and supply voltage on performance of motors and generator of a nuclear power plant has been analysed. The study is performed basically based on steady state conservative equations. Transient effects are not considered. It has been found that the impact on the performance of motors and generators are benign. An investigation on the process dynamics shows that due to provision of variable frequency drive systems for the important motors and other control measures, there is negligible impact on the heat transfer process. There is need for more detailed studies to be performed on the turbine control system, variable frequency drives and transient response for complete understanding and improvement. Keywords...|$|R

50|$|The {{method used}} by such systems {{includes}} the stationing {{of at least}} three receivers at known locations in order to triangulate their data. When any of the receivers detects a strong <b>electrical</b> <b>disturbance,</b> the location is shared with other receivers in the area for corroboration, and then (presuming the data has passed the filters), encoded and transmitted to a central facility and thereafter processed for deriving the position of the lightning strike.

50|$|Ground parties {{scoured the}} {{countryside}} looking for wreckage; {{critical to the}} investigation was the film from the cockpit camera. The weekend after the accident, an unofficial FRC search party found the camera; disappointingly, the film cartridge was nowhere in sight. Engineers theorized that the film cassette, being lighter than the camera, might be further away, blown north by winds at altitude. FRC engineer Victor Horton organized a search and on 29 November, during the first pass over the area, Willard E. Dives found the cassette. Most puzzling was Adams' complete lack of awareness of major heading deviations in spite of accurately functioning cockpit instrumentation. The accident board concluded that he had allowed the aircraft to deviate {{as the result of}} a combination of distraction, misinterpretation of his instrumentation display, and possible vertigo.

50|$|The {{electrical}} fault described above also affected unit 2 by causing breakers in the 230kv switchyard to trip cutting off power to RAT 2-B and vital bus B on unit 2. EDG 2-B subsequently started and restored {{power to the}} vital bus. At the same time, the <b>electrical</b> <b>disturbance</b> from the falling line striking the ground was detected by protective safeties on unit 2's main step-up transformer and a protective relay actuated and opened the transformer's output breaker causing a full load rejection to unit 2 {{which led to a}} turbine trip and reactor scram. After the unit tripped, the B non-vital electrical train lost power as it attempted to transfer from UAT 2-B (which is powered by the turbine generator) to the failed RAT 2-B causing two of the reactor coolant pumps and one of the main feedwater pumps to trip, though the plant cool down proceeded safely. At 9:03 p.m., the RAT 2-B breakers in the switchyard were reset and offsite power was restored to the vital and non-vital B electrical trains allowing reactor coolant pumps 2 and 4 to be restarted. EDG 2-B was shutdown. It was later determined that the fault disturbance caused by the line falling was not of significant magnitude to trip the protective relay per design and should not have caused unit 2 to shut down. Further investigation found that current transformers on the main transformer were improperly set. The controls were adjusted to the proper setting. Had the CTs been properly set initially, the unit would have remained online.|$|E
