5|$|Quentin Tarantino {{had been}} working at Video Archives, a video store in Manhattan Beach, California, and {{originally}} planned to shoot the film with his friends on a budget of $30,000 in a 16mm black-and-white format, with producer Lawrence Bender playing a police officer chasing Mr. Pink. Bender gave the script to his acting teacher, whose wife gave the script to Harvey Keitel. Keitel liked it enough to sign as a co-producer so Tarantino and Bender would <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> job finding funding; with his assistance, they raised $1.5 million. Keitel also paid for Tarantino and Bender to host casting sessions in New York, where the duo found Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, and Tim Roth.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 2012, The Weather Channel began to assign names to major winter storm systems. The channel's {{management}} stated the decision to start naming notable winter storms came {{as a way to}} more easily spread knowledge and raise awareness. By naming winter storms, TWC stated that the public would find it easier to follow storm information, social media will be able to refer to and discuss the storm, and people will <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> time referring to the storm after it occurs. Most independent sources identify the use of winter storm names by The Weather Channel as a form of SEO-friendly branding.|$|E

25|$|Fish tend {{to prefer}} shoals {{made up of}} {{individuals}} that match their own size. This makes sense as predators <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> time catching individuals that stand out in a shoal. Some fish may even prefer shoals of another species if this means a better match in current body size. As for shoal size however, hunger can affect the preference for similarly-sized fish; large fish, for example, might prefer to associate with smaller ones because of the competitive advantage they will gain over these shoalmates. In golden shiner, large satiated fish prefer to associate with other large individuals, but hungry ones prefer smaller shoalmates.|$|E
25|$|Alternate: Events {{which are}} {{played in the}} same week as a higher status tournament and {{therefore}} have weakened fields and reduced prize money. They are often considered an opportunity for players who would not qualify for certain events due to their world rankings, positions on the FedEx Cup points list, or position on the Tour's priority list to move up more easily or <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> attempt at a two-year exemption for winning a tournament. Because of their weaker fields, these events usually receive the minimum amount of world ranking points reserved for PGA Tour events (24 points) and fewer FedEx Cup points than most tournaments (300 points instead of 500). Alternate events also do not earn Masters invitations. Fields for alternate events have 132 players. These events have 12 unrestricted sponsor exemptions, four more than the regular events.|$|E
25|$|The {{failure of}} the {{conspiracy}} in Rome was a massive blow to Catiline. Upon hearing {{of the death of}} Publius Cornelius Lentulus Sura and the others, many men deserted his army, reducing the size from about 10,000 to a mere 3,000. He and his ill-equipped army began to march towards Gaul and then back towards Rome several times in vain attempts to avoid a battle. However, Catiline was forced to fight when Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer blocked him from the north with three legions. So, he chose to engage Antonius Hybrida's army near Pistoia, hoping that he could defeat Antonius in the ensuing battle and dishearten the other Republican armies. Catiline also hoped that he might <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> battle against Antonius who, he assumed, would fight less determinedly, as he had once been allied with Catiline. In fact, Catiline may have still believed that Antonius Hybrida was conspiring with him—which may have been true, as Antonius Hybrida claimed to be ill {{on the day of the}} battle.|$|E

Ruth's failed attempt to steal second base ended {{the game and the}} 1926 World Series; it is, as of 2016, the only time a World Series has ended with a runner being caught stealing. Ruth explained later that he attempted to steal second base because he thought no one would expect it.

500|$|Gameplay in the Super Smash Bros. series {{differs from}} many {{fighting}} games. Instead of winning by depleting an opponent's life bar, players seek to launch their opponents {{off the stage}} {{and out of the}} map. Characters have a damage total which rises as they take damage, represented by a percentage value that measures up to 999%. As a character's percentage rises, the character can be knocked progressively farther by an opponent's attacks. To knock out an opponent, the player must knock that character outside the arena's boundaries in any direction. When a character is launched off the stage, the character can attempt to [...] "recover" [...] by using jumping moves and abilities to return to the stage. Some characters <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> time recovering onto the stage than others due to their moves and abilities. Additionally, some characters vary in weight, with lighter characters being easier to launch than heavy characters.|$|E
500|$|The Super Smash Bros. {{series is}} a {{departure}} from many fighting games; instead of winning by depleting an opponent's life bar, Smash Bros. players seek to knock opposing characters off a stage. Each player has a damage total, represented by a percentage, which rises as damage is taken and can exceed 100%, with a maximum damage of 999%. As this percentage rises, the character can be knocked progressively farther by an opponent's attacks. To KO an opponent, the player must send that character flying {{off the edge of}} the stage, which is not an enclosed arena but rather an area with open boundaries, many suspended in an otherwise empty space. When knocked off the stage, a character may use jumping moves in an attempt to return; some characters have longer-ranged jumps and may <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> time [...] "recovering" [...] than others. Additionally, characters have different weights, making it harder for heavier opponents to be knocked off the edge, but reciprocally harder for them to recover once sent flying.|$|E

500|$|The biggest {{point of}} {{contention}} among the developers was including options allowing for the revival of fallen units in [...] "Casual Mode", a recurring discussion stretching back {{to the development of}} [...] (1996). The dispute between Intelligent Systems and Nintendo staff was fierce, but positive comments from playtests with the feature included helped those opposed come round to its inclusion. The four difficulty levels were made separate from the two modes of play, so players could adjust the experience to suit their needs. Another new element was the Avatar character, who was created so players would <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> introduction, as the developers realized that they might end up creating the game assuming players would know about main protagonist Marth when that might not be the case. Alongside the Avatar was a new tutorial, which the developers needed to balance so it was enjoyable for series veterans while easing new players into the experience. Also new was the element of time passing when the system was turned off and the cartridge still in place. The content grew {{to the point that the}} developers contemplated dividing New Mystery of the Emblem itself into two releases.|$|E
500|$|After leaving Central, mushers head west, {{paralleling}} the Steese Highway, which connects Central and Circle with Fairbanks. The trail {{travels through}} frozen swamps, mining areas, and firebreaks for about [...] Mushers then encounter the Steese Highway {{for a second}} time before crossing several creeks to begin the ascent of Eagle Summit. They eventually climb above the tree line and are exposed to the wind as they continue upward. The weather atop Eagle Summit is harsh as this is a convergence zone between the Yukon Flats to the north and the low ground of the Tanana Valley to the south. A differential in the weather within the two valleys causes high winds and precipitation when there is moisture in the atmosphere. The final few hundred yards of the climb consists of a 30-degree slope often scoured to bare rock and tundra by the fierce wind. The crossing point itself is a symmetrical saddle, with two peaks of similar height separated by [...] The south side of Eagle Summit is not as steep, and mushers generally <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> time reaching the checkpoint at Mile 101. When descending the steep northern slope of Eagle Summit on the Fairbanks–Whitehorse route, many mushers wrap their sled runners in chains to increase friction and slow the plunge.|$|E

2500|$|Freamon {{receives}} {{word from}} Daniels and assigns Leander Sydnor and Kenneth Dozerman {{to introduce the}} specifics of the search to the patrol division. Greggs asks what she can do and Freamon asks her to raise Sergeant Thomas [...] "Herc" [...] Hauk, who is currently suspended from duty pending the results of an internal investigation. Greggs finds Herc drinking in the morning and reluctant to become involved while suspended. She goads him into accompanying her by questioning whether he is police or not. She takes him to the site of his recent traffic stop of Chris Partlow and Felicia [...] "Snoop" [...] Pearson, as he told Freamon that he fired a nail from their nail gun into the road. They find the mark but are unable to locate the nail. Herc spends the whole time questioning why IID is investigating him when Marimow has been transferred away and Daniels had already given him a mild punishment for the incident with the minister. Tired of Herc's complaints, Greggs asks what he did in order to reassure him that he will <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> hearing. When Herc admits the falsified paperwork and stolen camera, Greggs and her partner Bunk Moreland shake their heads in disbelief. Herc experiences further dismay, concerned that he may lose more than just his sergeant's rank.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{question}} of whether every P set <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> (i. e., polynomialtime computable) census function. We characterize this question in terms of unlikely collapses of language and function classes such as #P 1 ` FP, where #P 1 is the class of functions that count the witnesses for tally NP sets. We prove that every #P PH 1 function can be computed in FP #P #P 1 1. Consequently, every P set <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> census function if and only if every set in the polynomial hierarchy does. We show that the assumption #P 1 ` FP implies P = BPP and PH ` MOD k P for each k 2, which provides further evidence that not all sets in P <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> census function. We also relate a set's property of <b>having</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> census function to other well-studied properties of sets, such as rankability and scalability (the closure of the rankable sets under P-isomorphisms).
