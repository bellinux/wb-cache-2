5|$|In 1965, {{historian}} Joseph Wulf {{proposed that}} the Wannsee House should {{be made into a}} Holocaust memorial and document centre, but the West German government was not interested at that time. The building was in use as a school, and <b>funding</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> available. Despondent at the failure of the project and the West German government's failure to pursue and convict Nazi war criminals, Wulf committed suicide in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Previously, {{there had}} been plans to extend the {{monorail}} system which connects many of the major area hotels and the Las Vegas Convention Center to the airport. In December 2006, Clark County approved plans for the extension, although <b>funding</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> specified. In its presentation to the Southern Nevada Tourism Infrastructure Committee in early 2016, Las Vegas Monorail expressed its continued interest in the extension. However, the project is largely no longer under consideration due to its high cost.|$|E

5|$|The ZBGM-75 Advanced Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, {{also known}} as Weapons System 120A (WS-120A), was a program to develop an {{intercontinental}} ballistic missile (ICBM), proposed by the United States Air Force in the 1960s {{as a replacement for}} the LGM-30 Minuteman as the Air Force's standard ICBM. <b>Funding</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> allocated for the program and the project was cancelled in 1967.|$|E
5|$|From January 1995, the {{frequency}} between Steinkjer and Melhus was increased slightly. On 26 September 1995, {{the train station}} in Trondheim reopened as a renovated station that serves both buses, coaches and trains. The investment cost NOK50 million. In 1997, NSB stated that the Trøndelag Commuter Rail was unprofitable and threatened to terminate it, along {{with an array of}} other services, if <b>funding</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> increased. The same year, 750,000 people traveled with the commuter rail. The 20% increase that year was in part due to the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1997 being held in Trondheim, and was the service in the country with the largest growth.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, the Yakovlev Yak-38, {{then the}} Soviet Navy's only {{operational}} carrier-based fixed-wing combat aircraft, {{was found to}} be unable to undertake its role due to limited range and payload, which severely hampered the capability of the Soviet Navy's Project 1143 carriers. It was decided to develop a bigger and more potent carrier capable of operating STOL aircraft. During the assessment period, a number of carriers were studied; the Project 1160 carrier {{would have been able to}} operate the MiG-23s and Su-24s, but was abandoned due to budget constraints. Design efforts were then concentrated on the Project 1153 carrier, which would have accommodated the Su-25s and the proposed MiG-23Ks and Su-27Ks. Sufficient <b>funding</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> secured, and the Navy looked at the possibility of a fifth, and larger, Project 1143 carrier, modified to allow for Yak-141, MiG-29K and Su-27K operations.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, Shamrock Rovers {{were granted}} {{land in the}} Dublin suburb of Tallaght {{to build a new}} stadium. On 30 March 2000, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern turned the sod at the site. However, work on the stadium ceased in 2001 and in March 2005, South Dublin County Council {{announced}} that they were taking back the land that they had granted to the club, as the conditions of the planning permission had not been met. A public consultation process was initiated in July 2005 and a resolution was passed in December 2005 to alter the stadium to accommodate senior GAA games while still having Shamrock Rovers as the preferred tenants. This decision was subject to additional government funding. This <b>funding</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> made available and on 13 January 2006 the council voted to proceed with the original plan.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial War Museum North {{was opened}} in Trafford, Greater Manchester in 2002. It {{was the first}} branch of the museum outside {{southeast}} England, {{and the first to}} be purpose-built as a museum. Designed by architect Daniel Libeskind, Imperial War Museum North was his first building in Britain. Libeskind’s building, overlooking the Manchester Ship Canal at Salford Quays, was based on the concept of a globe shattered by conflict into shards and reassembled. These shards, representing earth, air and water, give the building its shape. Originally budgeted at £40 million, the museum was eventually completed for £28.5 million after anticipated <b>funding</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> forthcoming. The museum was funded by local, national and European development agencies, by private donations and by Peel Holdings, a local transport and property company which contributed £12.5 million.|$|E
5|$|A revised {{environmental}} impact study {{to account for the}} butterfly's habitat was approved in 2004. The study compared the original proposal for this extension that involved connecting directly to I-196 at I-94 with a pair of alternate routines that involved connecting US31 directly to BL I-94 at I-94 near Benton Harbor with auxiliary lanes to I-196. The recommendation was to use the PA-2 version of the alternative connection to avoid the Blue Creek Fen. At the time the last freeway segment was opened in 2003, MDOT expected the remaining segment would not take much longer to complete, but <b>funding</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> available for many years. Construction of the extension was not included for this reason in subsequent MDOT five-year highway projects plans, although most of the design work and land acquisition was identified in 2013 as having been finished. Funding for the project was listed in the 2017–21 plan draft released in July 2016, which split the remaining work into three phases. Until the freeway is complete, US31 follows a stretch of Napier Avenue, which was upgraded in conjunction with the St. Joseph Valley Parkway opening to that point, westward to I-94. The US31/I-94/BL I-94 interchange will be converted to a cloverleaf interchange if a connection is completed in the future, and the St. Joseph Valley Parkway name has already been applied to this unbuilt section.|$|E

25|$|JSF Program Executive Officer, Air Force Major General Charles Davis, said in 2008 that discussions {{had been}} held with Spain, which could {{eventually}} lead to the F-35B replacing the Spanish Navy's EAV-8B Harrier fleet. In 2014 Spain decided to extend the lifespan of the Harriers to beyond 2025 as <b>funding</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> available to replace the type.

25|$|The funding request {{fared better}} in 1966. Once again, the House Appropriations Committee cut the administration's $45.7 million funding request in May. But {{with the land}} for the {{structure}} almost completely cleared, GSA would be left holding an empty lot if <b>funding</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> forthcoming. This prompted Congress to act. In October, a House-Senate budget conference committee recommended spending $11.3 million to excavate and build the foundation and to pour the first floor's concrete slab. Both chambers of Congress approved this expenditure late in the month.|$|E

SRF units were supposed to be authorized at 100% strength, receive priority training funds and modern equipment as well as having more training and doing 58 hours of drills of four hours each a year rather than the standard 48 hours of drills.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to military-issue religious vestments {{to be worn}} by chaplains during worship services or religious rites, United States Army Chief of Chaplains Charles Brown had a lapel pin created during the 1960s showing the Army Chaplain Corps seal (then with symbols of Christian and Jewish chaplains) for chaplains to wear with civilian clothing, {{in the same way}} some civilians wore lapel pins with their college seals.

25|$|Oslo's first {{airport was}} {{located on the}} {{neighboring}} island of Lindøya, but the authorities preferred Gressholmen as a location.

Deutsche Luft Hansa commenced the first service on 18 July 1927, flying from Oslo via Gothenburg and Copenhagen to Szczecin. The following year the terminus was moved to Travemünde outside Lübeck. The airport was also used by Halle & Peterson's Norway Post flights during the early 1930s and by Widerøe in 1934.|$|E

25|$|While {{work on the}} {{monument}} initially progressed on schedule, delays began to occur. <b>Funding</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> the issue: By November 1913, the ACMA had paid $20,000 to Ezekiel to secure raw bronze, and almost $22,725 remained in the organization's coffers to complete the memorial, ship it to America, and assemble and erect it. The first delay was small but significant, and occurred in early 1913 when Ezekiel could not obtain copies of the Confederate state shields in a timely fashion. This forced the ACMA and UDC {{to give up on}} a June 1913 dedication, and November 5 was informally set as the new date for the event.|$|E

The ACA already banned federal subsidies from being used to cover abortions, but did allow health insurance plans covering abortions to receive federal subsidies, so long as such <b>funding</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> directly used for abortion coverage. The Protect Life Act would have also allowed hospitals to refuse life-saving abortions to women in emergency situations.|$|E
25|$|George Washington, {{the first}} President of the United States, {{advocated}} {{the establishment of}} a centrally located national university in his first State of the Union address in 1790 and continued to promote this idea throughout his career and until his death. In his will, Washington left his 50 shares in the Potomac Company to help endow the university. However, due to the company's financial difficulties, the expected <b>funding</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> available. Instead funds were raised independently and on February 9, 1821, the university was chartered by an act of Congress.
