Numerous authentication techniques based on security printing, graphical codes, hashing or local hashing have been suggested earlier. In this paper, we propose a novel printed document authentication system based on sensitivity of a new two level QR (2 LQR) code to copying process. This 2 LQR code contains specific textured patterns, which are sensitive to printing and copying processes. Therefore, {{it can be used to}} detect unauthorized <b>document</b> <b>duplication.</b> Experimental results show the efficiency of this 2 LQR code for copy detection...|$|E
40|$|Federated {{information}} retrieval {{is a technique}} for searching multiple text collections simultaneously. Queries are submitted to a subset of collections that {{are most likely to}} return relevant answers. The results returned by selected collections are integrated and merged into a single list. Federated search is preferred over centralized search alternatives in many environments. For example, commercial search engines such as Google cannot index uncrawlable hidden web collections; federated {{information retrieval}} systems can search the contents of hidden web collections without crawling. In enterprise environments, where each organization maintains an independent search engine, federated search techniques can provide parallel search over multiple collections. There are three major challenges in federated search. For each query, a subset of collections that are most likely to return relevant documents are selected. This creates the collection selection problem. To be able to select suitable collections, federated information retrieval systems acquire some knowledge about the contents of each collection, creating the collection representation problem. The results returned from the selected collections are merged before the final presentation to the user. This final step is the result merging problem. In this thesis, we propose new approaches for each of these problems. Our suggested methods, for collection representation, collection selection, and result merging, outperform state-of-the-art techniques in most cases. We also propose novel methods for estimating the number of documents in collections, and for pruning unnecessary information from collection representations sets. Although management of <b>document</b> <b>duplication</b> has been cited as one of the major problems in federated search, prior research in this area often assumes that collections are free of overlap. We investigate the effectiveness of federated search on overlapped collections, and propose new methods for maximizing the number of distinct relevant documents in the final merged results. In summary, this thesis introduces several new contributions to the field of federated information retrieval, including practical solutions to some historically unsolved problems in federated search, such as <b>document</b> <b>duplication</b> management. We test our techniques on multiple testbeds that simulate both hidden web and enterprise search environments...|$|E

We also develop some methods to re-rank the subtopics and remove reduplicate ones with query log and search result snippets in search engines. In the document ranking task, methods applied to diversify English documents are used to validate their effectiveness on Chinese pages, such as HITS, Novelty-Result Selection and <b>Documents</b> <b>Duplication</b> Elimination.

Many organisations are convinced of the value in implementing process improvement standards and frameworks, evidencing an increasing global adoption of IT process improvement frameworks by organisations.

If those standards are operated as independent systems. Cost is a major consideration, as is prioritizing and scheduling of the implementations with ‘real work’. The phenomenon of organizations concurrently implementing multiple process frameworks supports the needs of model and methodologies to reduce inefficiencies and redundancy {{in the management of}} different standards and frameworks in a single organization. In this paper, we present a methodological approach to adopt a multiple approach in the management of standards and frameworks in the business management.

40|$|Effective peer {{selection}} for intelligent query routing {{is a challenge}} in collaborative peer-based Web search systems, especially unstructured networks {{that do not have}} any centralized control of peer document collections. In particular, routing a query to multiple peers that provide the same results is a waste of resources. To deal with overlapping document collections we propose a diverse peer selection approach for adaptive query routing. This approach takes into account not only which neighbors are the best resource providers for a given query, but also which combinations of neighbors can provide the least redundant results. We validate the feasibility of our proposed algorithm by presenting several simulation experiments conducted with different configurations of peer network environments. Two novel evaluation measures, distributed precision and distributed recall, are also introduced to provide an effective comparison of different peer network systems. These two performance measures extend the well known IR measures of precision and recall by integrating network costs, namely bandwidth and latency. Our algorithm finds results of equivalent quality using less time and generating less traffic in the presence of varying amounts of <b>document</b> <b>duplication...</b>|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that topics can be automatically discovered in a software project’s source code. Topics are collections of words that co-occur frequently in a text collection and are discovered using topic models such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Tracking how topics evolve, i. e., grow and spread, over time is useful for supporting software maintenance, comprehension, and re-engineering activities. The evolution of topics is typically recovered by applying LDA to all versions of a project’s source code at once, followed by post processing to map topics across versions. Although this technique works well in applications where each version of the data is completely different, for example in the analysis of conference proceedings, the technique does not work well with source code, which typically changes only incrementally and contains significant duplication across versions. In this paper, we present a new approach, called DiffLDA, for automatically mining topic evolution in source code. The approach addresses LDA’s sensitivity to <b>document</b> <b>duplication</b> by operating on the differences between versions of a source code document, resulting in a more accurate, finer-grained representation of topic evolution. We validate our approach through case studies on simulated data and two open source projects. 1...|$|E
40|$|Cooperative caching is {{a popular}} {{mechanism}} to allow an array of distributed caches to cooperate and serve each others’ Web requests. Controlling duplication of documents across cooperating caches is a challenging problem faced by cache managers. In this paper, we study the economics of <b>document</b> <b>duplication</b> in strategic and nonstrategic settings. We have three primary findings. First, {{we find that the}} optimum level of duplication at a cache is nondecreasing in intercache latency, cache size, and extent of request locality. Second, in situations in which cache peering spans organizations, we find that the interaction between caches is a game of strategic substitutes wherein a cache employs lesser resources towards eliminating duplicate documents when the other caches employs more resources towards eliminating duplicate documents at that cache. Thus, a significant challenge will be to simultaneously induce multiple caches to contribute more resources towards reducing duplicate documents in the system. Finally, centralized decision making, which as expected provides improvements in average latency over a decentralized setup, can entail highly asymmetric duplication levels at the caches. This in turn can benefit one set of users {{at the expense of the}} other, and thus will be challenging to implement...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSystematic process {{planning}} {{is a key}} enabler for robust product realization from design through manufacturing. Every process and operation must be designed {{in the best possible}} way to ensure that the overall process chain leads to the right product quality. During the last two decades a shift from inspection of manufactured products to a more holistic approach with quality assurance as an integrated activity throughout the product realization process has emerged in manufacturing industry. The importance of the principles addressed in the methods and tools used in automotive industry for quality management is indisputable. However, the tasks of creating and managing documents for Process Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (PFMEA), Control plans, Initial process studies and Measurement System Analysis (MSA) results in high workload. Also, lack of interoperability between different computer applications used in {{process planning}} and quality assurance results in information fragmentation, data duplication and potential data inconsistency. This paper proposes a novel, model driven approach for process planning integrating quality assurance which emphasizes the application of digital models to create, represent and use information of products, processes and resources.

This report seeks to quantify what proportion of that resource can be considered recoverable under today's technological and economic conditions and discusses factors controlling recovery. The ultimate goal of this project is to encourage development of tight gas reserves by industry through reducing the technical and economic risks of locating, drilling and completing commercial tight gas wells. This report is the fourth in a series and focuses on the Wind River Basin located in west central Wyoming. The first three reports presented analyses of the tight gas reserves and resources in the Greater Green River Basin (Scotia, 1993), Piceance Basin (Scotia, 1995) and the Uinta Basin (Scotia, 1995). Since each report is a stand-alone <b>document,</b> <b>duplication</b> of language will exist where common aspects are discussed. This study, and the previous three, describe basin-centered gas deposits (Masters, 1979) which contain vast {{quantities of}} natural gas entrapped in low permeability (tight), overpressured sandstones occupying a central basin location. Such deposits are generally continuous and are not conventionally trapped by a structural or stratigraphic seal. Rather, the tight character of the reservoirs prevents rapid migration of the gas, and where rates of gas generation exceed rates of escape, an overpressured basin-centered gas deposit results (Spencer, 1987). Since the temperature is a primary controlling factor for the onset and rate of gas generation, these deposits exist in the deeper, central parts of a basin where temperatures generally exceed 200 F and drill depths exceed 8, 000 feet. The abbreviation OPT (overpressured tight) is used when referring to sandstone reservoirs that comprise the basin-centered gas deposit. Because the gas resources trapped in this setting are so large, they represent {{an important source of}} future gas supply, prompting studies to understand and quantify the resource itself and to develop technologies that will permit commercial exploitation.

Our {{aim is to}} rationalize the molecular basis of their function by studying their evolution using computational biology techniques. Phylogenetic analysis is of primary importance for classifying cognate orthologs; profile hidden Markov models (HMM) of individual subfamilies discern functionally relevant sites by conservation probability analysis; and 3 -dimensional structures display the integral protein in context. The major classifications of calcium-binding proteins, viz. EF-hand, C 2 and ANX, exhibit structural diversity in their HMM fingerprints at the subfamily level, with functional consequences for protein conformation, exposure of receptor interaction sites and/or binding to membrane phospholipids.

This type of shading test is particularly useful to evaluate the impact of different power conversion setups, including microinverters, DC power optimizers and string inverters, on overall system performance. The performance results are weighted based on annual estimates of shade to predict annual performance improvement. A trial run of the test procedure was conducted with a side by side comparison of a string inverter with a microinverter, both operating on identical 8 kW solar arrays.

We developed a birth–death model to identify evidence for genome duplication in EST data, and applied a mixture model to estimate the age distribution of paralogous pairs identified in EST sets for species representing the basal-most extant flowering plant lineages. We found evidence for episodes of ancient genome-wide duplications in the basal angiosperm lineages including Nuphar advena (yellow water lily: Nymphaeaceae) and the magnoliids Persea americana (avocado: Lauraceae), Liriodendron tulipifera (tulip poplar: Magnoliaceae), and Saruma henryi (Aristolochiaceae). In addition, we detected independent genome duplications in the basal eudicot Eschscholzia californica (California poppy: Papaveraceae) and the basal monocot Acorus americanus (Acoraceae), {{both of which were}} distinct from <b>duplications</b> <b>documented</b> for ancestral grass (Poaceae) and core eudicot lineages. Among gymnosperms, we found equivocal evidence for ancient polyploidy in Welwitschia mirabilis (Gnetales) and no evidence for polyploidy in pine, although gymnosperms generally have much larger genomes than the angiosperms investigated. Cross-species sequence divergence estimates suggest that synonymous substitution rates in the basal angiosperms are less than half those previously reported for core eudicots and members of Poaceae. These lower substitution rates permit inference of older duplication events. We hypothesize that evidence of an ancient duplication observed in the Nuphar data may represent a genome duplication in the common ancestor of all or most extant angiosperms, except Amborella...|$|R

Mammals express a specialized version of NulOs called sialic acids, which are displayed in prominent terminal positions of cell surface and secreted glycoconjugates. Within bacteria, the ability to synthesize NulOs has been demonstrated in a number of human pathogens and is phylogenetically widespread. Here we examine the distribution, diversity, evolution, and function of NulO biosynthesis pathways in members of the family Vibrionaceae. Among 27 species of Vibrionaceae examined at the genomic level, 12 species contained nab gene clusters. We <b>document</b> examples of <b>duplication,</b> divergence, horizontal transfer, and recombination of nab gene clusters in different Vibrionaceae lineages. Biochemical analyses, including mass spectrometry, confirmed that many species do, in fact, produce di-N-acetylated NulOs.

The data show that lineage I isolates produce about 20 -fold higher levels of NulOs than lineage II isolates. Moreover, nab gene alleles found in a subset of V. vulnificus clinical isolates express 40 -fold higher levels of NulOs than nab alleles associated with environmental isolates. Taken together, the data implicate the family Vibrionaceae as a “hot spot” of NulO evolution and suggest that these molecules may have diverse roles in environmental persistence and/or animal virulence...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Miscanthus (subtribe Saccharinae, tribe Andropogoneae, family Poaceae) is a genus of {{temperate}} perennial C 4 grasses whose high biomass production makes it, {{along with}} its close relatives sugarcane and sorghum, attractive as a biofuel feedstock. The base chromosome number of Miscanthus (x = 19) {{is different from that}} of other Saccharinae and approximately twice that of the related Sorghum bicolor (x = 10), suggesting large-scale duplications may have occurred in recent ancestors of Miscanthus. Owing to the complexity of the Miscanthus genome and the complications of self-incompatibility, a complete genetic map with a high density of markers has not yet been developed. Results We used deep transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) from two M. sinensis accessions to define 1536 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) for a GoldenGate&# 8482; genotyping array, and found that simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers defined in sugarcane are often informative in M. sinensis. A total of 658 SNP and 210 SSR markers were validated via segregation in a full sibling F 1 mapping population. Using 221 progeny from this mapping population, we constructed a genetic map for M. sinensis that resolves into 19 linkage groups, the haploid chromosome number expected from cytological evidence. Comparative genomic analysis <b>documents</b> a genome-wide <b>duplication</b> in Miscanthus relative to Sorghum bicolor, with subsequent insertional fusion of a pair of chromosomes. The utility of the map is confirmed by the identification of two paralogous C 4 -pyruvate, phosphate dikinase (C 4 -PPDK) loci in Miscanthus, at positions syntenic to the single orthologous gene in Sorghum. Conclusions The genus Miscanthus experienced an ancestral tetraploidy and chromosome fusion prior to its diversification, but after its divergence from the closely related sugarcane clade. The recent timing of this tetraploidy complicates discovery and mapping of genetic markers for Miscanthus species, since alleles and fixed differences between paralogs are comparable. These difficulties can be overcome by careful analysis of segregation patterns in a mapping population and genotyping of doubled haploids. The genetic map for Miscanthus will be useful in biological discovery and breeding efforts to improve this emerging biofuel crop, and also provide a valuable resource for understanding genomic responses to tetraploidy and chromosome fusion...|$|R
