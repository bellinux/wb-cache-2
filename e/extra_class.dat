40|$|Although {{primary school}} {{enrolment}} in Vietnam is high (91 per cent), most primary school students receive {{little more than}} half the annual teaching time defined by international norms. The Vietnamese school year is very short by international standards, covering only 33 weeks. In addition, only around 20 per cent of children in Vietnam receive a full-day of schooling, 5 or 6 hours according to international standards. <b>Extra</b> <b>classes,</b> outside of the normal school system, have proliferated in all regions of Vietnam. These classes fall into two categories. Legal classes, organised by schools themselves, include those provided for low-score performers or for outstandingly talented children. Illegal classes are taught by teachers who deliberately reduce the duration and content of their school-based classes to encourage students to take private tuition. The Vietnamese government is committed to providing full shifts of primary education by 2015 and has banned <b>extra</b> <b>classes</b> provided outside the normal school system. Nonetheless, the availability of and enrolment in illegal <b>extra</b> <b>classes</b> continue to increase. Young Lives research examined the extent and effects of <b>extra</b> <b>classes</b> for eight-year-old children in Vietnam. It tested for association between <b>extra</b> <b>classes</b> and numeracy, reading and writing skills. The paper presents statistical data on the amount of time and money spent on <b>extra</b> <b>classes.</b> The authors argue that such classes should be restricted because of the financial pressure that they place on poor households –without improving the attainment of children who take them...|$|R

5|$|The {{prototype}} and series trains have various differences. The {{number of}} seats was increased from 264 to 309 by changing the seat configuration in second class from 2+1 to 2+2.

There are also differences with the light switch logic, which often leads to the trains running with both front and tail lights on at the same end. The prototypes differed also originally by their restaurant car and <b>Extra</b> <b>class</b> features. They were modified in the mid-2000s to be similar to the series trains.|$|E
40|$|Background. Aggressive {{behaviors}} must {{be addressed}} in elementary schools. Massage and storytelling can be strategies to deal with aggression because both involve experience exchange and social interaction. Both can decrease stress and anxiety and increase self-esteem. Objective. To evaluate the effect of two interventions (massage and storytelling) on aggressive behaviors and academic performance of elementary school children. Method. Three groups (n= 35 children in each group) of the second grade participated (aged 6. 5 – 8. 1 years). One group received ten <b>extra</b> <b>classes</b> of massage (MG), another group received <b>extra</b> <b>classes</b> of storytelling (SG), and the control group received <b>extra</b> <b>classes</b> of random subjects (CG). <b>Extra</b> <b>classes</b> lasted for 50 minutes, once a week. Aggressive behaviors were recorded on diaries, by the teachers and the coordinator. The frequency of aggressive behaviors and {{the academic performance of}} MG, SG, and CG were observed for six months and the groups were compared. Findings. ANOVAs evidenced that MG and SG, but not CG, showed a reduction in aggressive behaviors registered by the teachers and coordinator, after the intervention.

40|$|Abstract. A new {{segmentation}} algorithm for multifont Farsi/Arabic texts {{based on}} conditional labeling of {{up and down}} contours was presented in [1]. A preprocessing technique was used to adjust the local base line for each subword. Adaptive base line, up and down contours and their curvatures were used to improve the segmentation results. The algorithm segments 97 % of 22236 characters in 18 fonts correctly. However, finding {{the best way to}} receive high performance in the multifont case is challengeable. Different characteristics of each font are the reason. Here we propose an idea to consider some <b>extra</b> <b>classes</b> in the recognition stage. The <b>extra</b> <b>classes</b> will be some parts of characters or the combination of 2 or more characters causing most of errors in segmentation stage. These <b>extra</b> <b>classes</b> will be determined statistically. We have used a learn document of 4820 characters for 4 fonts. Segmentation result improves from 96. 7 % to 99. 64 %...|$|R

40|$|Do {{children}} {{with access to}} private tutoring feel happier than those without? In answering this question, this paper offers a novel way to understand the potential merit of providing private tutoring for children. Using a unique data set on Vietnamese children from Round 2 of the Young Lives 2006 Survey, this paper explores the link between taking <b>extra</b> <b>classes</b> and a child's subjective well-being, measured by degree of satisfaction regarding their current and future life. Estimation results from Ordinary Least-Square regressions indicate such a link to be positive and significant, which is further confirmed by Ordered Probit regressions aiming to control for the discontinuous nature of the dependent variable. To control for potential endogeneity of households' choice to purchase <b>extra</b> <b>classes,</b> the method of Propensity Score Matching is applied. Results from different versions of nearest-neighbour matching and Kernel matching indicate that {{children with}} private tutoring tend to feel happier about their current life, although the long-run effect of taking <b>extra</b> <b>classes</b> on a child's subjective well-being is {{more sensitive to the}} matching methods used...|$|R

25|$|Amateur radio {{licensing}} in the United States {{exemplifies the}} way in which some countries award different levels of amateur radio licenses based on technical knowledge: three sequential levels of licensing exams (Technician Class, General Class, and Amateur <b>Extra</b> <b>Class)</b> are currently offered, which allow operators who pass them access to larger portions of the Amateur Radio spectrum and more desirable (shorter) call signs. An exam, authorized by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), is required for all levels of the Amateur Radio license. These exams are administered by Volunteer Examiners, accredited by the FCC-recognized Volunteer Examiner Coordinator (VEC) system. The Technician Class and General Class exams consist of 35 multiple-choice questions, drawn randomly from a pool of at least 350. To pass, 26 of the 35 questions must be answered correctly. The <b>Extra</b> <b>Class</b> exam has 50 multiple choice questions (drawn randomly from a pool of at least 500), 37 of which must be answered correctly. The tests cover regulations, customs, and technical knowledge, such as FCC provisions, operating practices, advanced electronics theory, radio equipment design, and safety. Morse Code is no longer tested in the U.S. Once the exam is passed, the FCC issues an Amateur Radio license which is valid for ten years. Studying for the exam is made easier because the entire question pools for all license classes are posted in advance. The question pools are updated every four years by the National Conference of VECs.|$|E
25|$|Until 1991, a {{demonstration}} of the ability to send and receive Morse code at a minimum of five words per minute (wpm) was required to receive an amateur radio license for use in the United States from the Federal Communications Commission. Demonstration of this ability was still required for the privilege to use the HF bands. Until 2000, proficiency at the 20 wpm level was required to receive the highest level of amateur license (Amateur Extra Class); effective April 15, 2000, the FCC reduced the <b>Extra</b> <b>Class</b> requirement to five wpm. Finally, effective on February 23, 2007, the FCC eliminated the Morse code proficiency requirements from all amateur radio licenses.|$|E

500|$|According to Theron Martin, the OVA series School Rumble: <b>Extra</b> <b>Class</b> {{was made}} mostly for devoted fans; {{claiming}} that {{familiarity with the}} series is almost a necessity before watching it, although he later came {{to the view that}} it may also be useful as a sampler of the series. Chris Beveridge gives the OVA series an overall negative review. He did not highlight a single specific reason, instead observing that although all elements that [...] "make the TV series enjoyable are certainly present here, they just feel weaker". However, it did make him want to watch more of the television series, thus serving its intended purpose in keeping interest in the series alive. Katherine Luther endorsed the view that viewers need to be familiar with the story, but reviewed the OVA positively. While she noted lulls in the action, she believes fans will be able to overlook this. Unlike Martin, Luther did not believe the OVA is a good introduction to School Rumble, due to its short sequences and seemingly random nature.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of {{incentive}} licensing, {{only a small percentage}} of General Class operators progressed to the Amateur <b>Extra</b> <b>Class.</b> [...] After incentive licensing, a large number of amateurs attained Advanced and Amateur <b>Extra</b> <b>Class</b> licenses.
