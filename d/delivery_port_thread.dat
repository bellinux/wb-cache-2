40|$|A {{hand-held}} apparatus {{designed for}} the purpose of administering dry powder inhalations to rodents by “Nose-only ” exposure was standardized. An aerosol of microparticles containing the anti-tuberculosis drugs isoniazid and rifabutin was generated and the dose available for inhalation by rodents was determined by collecting microparticles emitted at the <b>delivery</b> <b>port.</b> Separate groups of mice received inhalations of microparticles, free rifabutin orally, or free rifabutin intravenously. Rifabutin was estimated in serum and tissues by HPLC. When ~ 20 mg of microparticles were loaded in the apparatus, ~ 2. 5 mg were collected at the <b>delivery</b> <b>port</b> in 30 seconds of operation. Mice inhaled ~ 300 μg of the 2. 5 mg emitted at the <b>delivery</b> <b>port.</b> Alveolar macrophages of mice receiving inhalations for 30 sec accumulated 0. 38 μg of rifabutin, while the amount in blood serum of these mice was 0. 62 μg. In mice receiving 83 μg rifabutin intravenously or orally, the intracellular amounts were 0. 06 and 0. 07 μg respectively, while the amounts in serum were 1. 02 and 0. 80 μg. These observations confirmed that inhalation of microparticles targeted lung macrophages. The dose available for inhalation was consistent with the duration of exposure (10. 5 - 13. 5 CV%) and its dependence on the amount of microparticles loaded (r 2 = 0. 982), and on duration of exposure (r 2 = 0. 992), was satisfactory...|$|R

50|$|With {{a service}} brake relay valve installed, the hose that {{connects to the}} primary delivery-port output of the foot-valve becomes a control-line (i.e., The air from the foot-valve “dead ends” at the relay valve's control-port.). Only low-volume air-signals are {{required}} to travel {{back and forth between}} the foot-valve's <b>delivery</b> <b>port</b> and the relay valve's control port; therefore, the air-volume supplied by the <b>delivery</b> <b>port</b> is now only a tiny-fraction of what otherwise would have been required had the relay valve not been installed. This reduces the delay between the application of the front and rear brakes to only a fraction of a second. When the driver depresses the brake pedal, a small amount of air momentarily opens the relay valve's supply port, which then directs air from the remote air-supply directly to the rear service brake chambers, and quickly applies the rear service brakes. The pressure delivered to the service brake chambers in this manner will equal the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve to the relay valve. When the driver partially or fully releases the brake pedal, the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve decreases; this causes the relay valve's supply port to close, and its exhaust port to momentarily open, thus preventing a pneumatic short-circuit from occurring while the air exhausts from all rear service brake chambers.|$|R

40|$|Background and Objectives: Explanations for laparoscopic-induced {{hypothermia}} fail {{to explain}} clinical observations. It {{is possible that}} water evaporation occurs from the jet stream of gas inflation resulting in tissue surface super-cooling leading to tissue damage and drying. Methods: Theoretical calculations based on thermal conductivity, mass transfer effects and heat flux considerations correlated closely with synthetic and tissue experiments. Thermocouple measurements {{at a rate of}} 15 data points per second were performed. Results: Cooling rates of 10 to 25 degrees centigrade per second for high flow rates were found based on gas flow rate and effective size of gas delivery site. These rapid temperature drops extended beyond a 2 cm 2 diameter. Conclusions: Evaporative cooling accounts for significant hypothermia. The cooling is dependent on the lack of water vapor in the gases currently used during laparoscopy. Cooling rates are independent of height from tissue and geometry of <b>delivery</b> <b>port.</b> Heating and hydrating the gas to a physiologic condition eliminates hypothermia and tissue dessication...|$|R

50|$|Known as the Papa pump, this utilises the low {{pressure}} generated by high velocity water flow around a curve-shaped elastomeric valve (with {{low pressure}} loss) {{to allow a}} valve design that enables rapid closure and with a relatively small cross sectional area and low weight. The venturi valve is configured as a ring section positioned around the supply inlet of the pump with the delivery outlet of the pump being directly in line. The design allowed the pump structure to be concentric and therefore inherently strong and upon closure of the valve, permits efficient water delivery by acting {{in line with the}} supply via a second smaller venturi effect delivery non return valve. The elastomeric material and operation of these valves also allows them to self-return without weight or spring assistance. A pressure vessel installed on a tee connected to the <b>delivery</b> <b>port</b> of the pump provides the pulsed flow accumulation means.

From 1951 to 1989 Fernald converted uranium ore into metal, and then fabricated this metal into target elements for nuclear reactors.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the effects of the dissolution time – time for the liquid to absorb the gas till the saturation state - on the behaviour of positivedisplacement vane pumps, in terms of pressure peaks within internal chambers and forces applied to the stator ring. The chamber pressurization depends on the volume variation and fluid Bulk modulus in the pre-compression phase during which the volume is trapped between the suction and the <b>delivery</b> <b>port</b> rims. If the dissolution time is short, then the entrained air is quickly absorbed and the fluid Bulk modulus sharply increases just before opening the connection to the outlet; as a consequence, pressure peaks may appear thus degrading the NVH characteristics of the pump. Moreover the pressure within internal chambers generate i) a torque demand to the driver (the combustion engine or an electrical motor) and ii) a total force applied to the stator ring. In case of fixed displacement designs, the resultant pressure force simply represents a load for support bearings; while in case of variable designs, it contributes to the displacement regulation. Simulation results show that the pump behaviour is very sensitive to the dissolution time when it is quite close to the duration of the trapped period...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A plastic micro drug {{delivery}} system has been suc-cessfully demonstrated by utilizing the principle of osmosis without any electrical power consumption. The system has an osmotic mi-croactuator (see Su, Lin, and Pisano, J. Microelectromech., vol. 11, pp. 736 – 7462, Dec. 2002) and a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mi-crofluidic cover compartment consisting of a reservoir, a microflu-idic channel and a <b>delivery</b> <b>port.</b> The typical dimension of the mi-crofluidic channel is 1 cm in length with a cross-sectional area of 30 100 m 2 to minimize the diffusive drug flow while pressure drop remains moderate. Using oxygen plasma to activate the sur-faces of polymers for bonding, the osmotic actuator is bonded with the PDMS cover while liquid drug can be encapsulated during the bonding process. Employing the net water flow induced by osmosis, the prototype {{drug delivery}} system has a measured con-stant delivery rate at 0. 2 L h for 10 h with an accumulated de-livery volume of 2 L.

40|$|We have {{developed}} {{simple and fun}} “fishing games” which can be played easily and quickly with cheap supplies—and which demonstrate important economic characteristics of fisheries. Players “fish” by scooping beads from a common bowl into individual cups placed near the bowl. The beads are the fish stock; the scoops are the fishing gear, and the cups are the player’s <b>delivery</b> <b>ports.</b> Players pay a rental cost for their gear (scoop), which depends upon the scoop size they choose. They are paid a price for their fish, which depends upon {{the distance of the}} cup from the bowl. If not allowed to communicate, most players compete aggressively to maximize their harvests from the limited total stock of beads by scooping as fast as they can. We describe three games which compellingly illustrate three important mechanisms by which rent dissipation may occur in competitive fisheries. The “gear-choice game” illustrates cost-driven rent dissipation as players choose larger, higher-cost scoops rather than the smallest and lowest-cost scoops. The “port-choice game” illustrates value-driven rent dissipation as players deliver beads to a closer but lower-priced cup. The “harvest choice game”—in which the volume left un-harvested each period determines {{the extent to which the}} bead stock is replenished for the next period—illustrates resource-driven rent dissipation as players over-harvest in earlier periods. In all of these games, replacing competitive fishing with individual quotas immediately and dramatically changes player behavior and increases rents.

Saline-pretreated rats responded more to the CS+ than the CS− (core n= 8; shell n= 9), and inactivating the core but not shell attenuated this effect. These data highlight an important role for the core in cue-induced ethanol-seeking, and suggest that the shell is required to mediate the influence of contexts on conditioned ethanol-seeking...|$|R
