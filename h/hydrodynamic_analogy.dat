SYSTEMS WITH VISCOUS FRICTION The energy dissipation in the dynamics of a viscous uid gives rise to many characteristic phenomena, for example, to the diusion of vortices (see [1]). In the dynamics of systems with a nite number of degrees of freedom at low velocities of motion, the viscous-friction forces are usually modeled by the Rayleigh dissipation function [2].

On large scale, the quantum stochastic <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>analogy</b> (QSHA) shows dynamics that under some circumstances may acquire the classical evolution. The QSHA puts in evidence that in presence of spatially distributed noise the quantum pseudo-potential restores the quantum behavior on a distance shorter than the correlation length of fluctuations (named here lc) of the quantum wave function modulus. The quantum mechanics is achieved in the deterministic limit when lc tends to infinity {{with respect to the}} scale of the problem. When the physical length of the problem is of order or larger than lc, the quantum potential may have a finite range of efficacy maintaining the non-local behavior on a distance lL (named here "quantum non-locality length") depending both by the noise amplitude and by the inter-particle strength of interaction. In the deterministic limit (quantum mechanics) the model shows that the "quantum non-locality length" lLalso becomes infinite. The QSHA unveils that in linear systems fluctuations are not sufficient to break the quantum non-locality showing that lL is infinite even if lc is finite.

40|$|This work {{explores the}} impact of {{nanoscale}} surface heterogeneity, small relative to the effective contact area between two surfaces, on pairwise colloid-scale interactions. Polycation-based positive patches, of order 10 nm in diameter, arranged randomly and lying flat on otherwise negative substrates, were used to create surfaces whose competing attractive and repulsive features determined the net interactions with opposing surfaces. Lab experiments and simulations of the adhesion of gently flowing dilute negative microparticles varied particle size (0. 5 – 2 μm), ionic strength (κ− 1 = 1 – 12 nm) and the density of heterogeneity on the collectors. Limiting behaviors from heterogeneity-controlled at high ionic strength to mean-field-like interactions at low ionic strength are reported. When heterogeneities are important, pairwise interactions are more attractive than predicted by average surface properties (e. g. per DLVO), and an adhesion threshold, describing the minimum average density of cationic features needed for single particle capture (adhesion), depends strongly on Debye length. In the opposite limit, the threshold becomes insensitive to the Debye length, and the average surface character approximates the interactions. An analytical treatment, reduced to a simple scaling argument predicts a − 1 / 2 power-law dependence of the adhesion threshold on Debye length and particle size. A slightly stronger particle size dependence in experiments and simulations results from hydrodynamic contributions along with slight scaling differences in electrostatic, van der Waals, and <b>hydrodynamic</b> forces. An <b>analogy</b> to biological ligands is made for the heterogeneity-dominated limit: it is discovered, for this particular system, that engagement of as few as 20 – 100 cationic patches dictates particle adhesion (with details depending on flow, particle size, and ionic strength), similar to reports for selectin-mediated rolling of white blood cells during the inflammatory pathway. Also discovered is a heterogeneity-dependent crossover in the effect of ionic strength on particle capture, where added salt promotes particle adhesion in most cases but stabilizes the particles when the heterogeneity becomes relatively dense...|$|R

40|$|The quantum <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>analogy</b> (QHA), {{equivalent}} to the Schrödinger equation, is investigated and extended to the stochastic case. The investigation shows {{that in addition to}} reproducing the standard quantum mechanics the QHA model is able to generally describe the quantum stochastic dynamics leading to the dissipative Schrödinger equation given by Kostin [55] as a particular case. The inspection shows that the QHA is well suited for the treatment of problems where local noise (spatially distributed one) is introduced. In this case the analysis shows that the bi-univocal correspondence between the QHA and the Schrödinger approach breaks down and that the states described by the QHA do not have their corresponding ones into the Schrödinger description.

The product of the minimum measuring time multiplied by the variance of energy fluctuation due to presence of stochastic noise shows to lead to the minimum uncertainty principle.

40|$|Nanomedicine holds great {{promises}} in {{the treatment}} {{of a wide range of}} diseases, such as cancer, pain, infections and inflammatory disorders. In fact, the primary aim of nanomedicine is the improvement of human health delivering drug molecules within the body to their final biological target with minimal toxicit and in a controlled manner. For this purpose, the use of nano- and micro-particulate Drug Delivery Systems (DDSs) has emerged as a valuable potential tool for performing the main goals of nanomedicine (i. e. targeted delivery, stability of the drug, high permeability, controlled release-kinetic and reduced side-effects). To evaluate the delivery efficiency of drug carriers, it is crucial to study their transport, adhesion and distribution in blood flow. In particular, for particle transport and distribution in microcirculation (i. e. capillaries, arterioles and venules, where most of the exchange with tissues takes place), the particulate nature of blood and the deformability of Red Blood Cells (RBCs) needs to be considered. A key step in particle-based drug delivery through microcirculation is particle migration from blood flow to vessel walls, also known as “margination”, which promotes particle contact and adhesion to the vessel wall. In physiology, the term refers to the flow behaviour of white blood cells (WBCs) and platelets, that concentrate in the RBC-free-layer (RBC-FL), a near-wall region depleted of RBCs, which originates from the migration of RBCs toward the vessel centerline due to a <b>hydrodynamic</b> lift. In <b>analogy</b> with platelets and WBCs, drug carriers within the bloodstream are also expected to migrate in the RBC-FL near the vessel wall. Margination and adhesion should be independently addressed as two distinct phenomena, considering that the former is a fundamental prerequisite to achieve particle adhesion and subsequent extravasation. Although margination has been modeled by numerical simulations and investigated in model systems in vitro, experimental studies including RBCs and environmental conditions mimicking human microcirculation are currently lacking. Here, we evaluate the effect of several parameters on margination through microfluidic studies in vitro and by intravital microscopy in vivo. In particular, the dependence of micro-particles (μ-Ps) distribution and delivery efficacy on the presence of RBCs, shear rate, particle size, shape, surface charge and stiffness is examined. We show that margination, which is almost absent when particles are suspended in a cell-free medium, is drastically enhanced by RBCs, in a pressure drop-dependent manner. In particular, as the shear rate increases, the μ-P concentration near the wall increases. The margination is also affected by μ-P size and shape, larger spherical/discoid particles being more effectively marginated both in vitro and in vivo. μ-Ps with different surface charge, instead, show a comparable margination propensity, suggesting that the presence of RBCs governs suspension flow behavior independently on μ-P surface properties. Finally, margination of carriers decreases when their stiffness decreases. Our findings can be explained by the collision of particles with RBCs that induces the drifting of the particles towards the vessel walls where they become trapped in the cell-free layer. These results are relevant for the design of drug delivery strategies based on systemically administered carriers, providing a quantitative analysis on how the particulate nature of blood, particle properties and physiological conditions influence μ-P delivery and distribution...|$|R

If in absence of fluctuation each QHA solution can be tracked back to the equivalent one of the Schrödinger problem, in presence of fluctuations the work shows that the ensemble of solution of the QHA equations is wider than the Schrödinger one and the tracking-back procedure from the QHA problem to the original Schrödinger equation is not generally possible. The break-down of the mathematical correspondence is inspected and correlated to {{the characteristics of the}} states. Finally, the paper shows that if the form of Schrödinger equation is generalized, the QHA stochastic case as well as its classical limit can be translated into a Schrödinger-like representation.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the deformation of superplastic materials shows that the structure tends to evolve towards an equiaxed state and to undergo grain growth. This behaviour influences the constitutive equations : apparent strain-hardening, sigmoidal variation of the Log stress- Log strain rate curve, low apparent activation energy values at intermediate strain rates. This deformation behaviour can be explained when the structural change is taken into account.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper the gas, liquid and solid phases made of structureless particles, are visited to {{the light of the}} quantum {{stochastic}} <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>analogy</b> (SQHA). The SQHA shows that the open quantum mechanical behavior is maintained on a distance shorter than the theory-defined quantum correlation length (lc). When, the physical length of the problem is larger than lc, the model shows that the quantum (potential) interactions may have a finite range of interaction maintaining the non-local behavior on a finite distance quantum non-locality length lq. The present work shows that when the mean molecular distance is larger than the quantum non-locality length we have a classical phases (gas and van der Waals liquids) while when the mean molecular distance becomes smaller than lq or than lc we have phases such as the solid crystal or the superfluid one, respectively, that show quantum characteristics.

It is shown that an infinite set of deflection functions, resulting from a product solution to the double Laplacian, may be generated, but practical utility is impeded because the functions are non-orthogonal. It is believed that should the importance of the solution warrant, the deflection of a sector under normal loading may be found by using a combination of the deflection functions, the Trefftz variational method, and high speed computing machinery. Another section of the report is devoted to a study of the stress along the clamped edge {{in the vicinity of the}} corner, and it is shown that the stress varies from zero to a mathematical infinity as the opening angle of the sector increases from zero through ninety degrees with the stress singularity becoming progressivev stronger as the opening angle is increased.

40|$|Elements of a "deeper level" {{explanation}} of the deBroglie-Bohm (dBB) version of quantum mechanics are presented. Our explanation {{is based on an}} analogy of quantum wave-particle duality with bouncing droplets in an oscillating medium, the latter being identified as the vacuum's zero-point field. A <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>analogy</b> of a similar type has recently come under criticism by Richardson et al., because despite striking similarities at a phenomenological level the governing equations related to the force on the particle are evidently different for the hydrodynamic and the quantum descriptions, respectively. However, said differences are not relevant if a radically different use of said analogy is being made, thereby essentially referring to emergent processes in our model. If the latter are taken into account, one can show that the forces on the particles are identical in both the dBB and our model. In particular, this identity results from an exact matching of our emergent velocity field with the Bohmian "guiding equation". One thus arrives at an explanation involving a deeper, i. e. subquantum, level of the dBB version of quantum mechanics. We show in particular how the classically-local approach of the usual hydrodynamical modeling can be overcome and how, as a consequence, the configuration-space version of dBB theory for $N$ particles can be completely substituted by a "superclassical" emergent dynamics of $N$ particles in real 3 -dimensional space.

In this case, the model shows that the transition to stationary states with higher free energy can happen and that, in incompressible fluids, the increase of free energy is almost given by a decrease of entropy leading to the appearance of self-ordered structures. The output of the theory showing that the generation of order, via energy dissipation, is more efficient in fluids than in gasses, because of their incompressibility, leads to the re-conciliation between physics and biology furnishing the eplanation why the life was born in water. The theoretical output also suggests that the search for life out of the earth must consider the possibility to find it in presence of liquid phases different from water.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{particle}} method in quantum mechanics which provides an exact scheme {{to calculate the}} time-dependent wavefunction from a single-valued continuum of trajectories where two spacetime points are linked by at most a single orbit. A natural language for the theory is offered by the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>analogy,</b> in which wave mechanics corresponds to the Eulerian picture and the particle theory to the Lagrangian picture. The Lagrangian model for the quantum fluid may be developed from a variational principle. The Euler-Lagrange equations imply a fourth-order nonlinear partial differential equation to calculate the trajectories of the fluid particles as functions of their initial coordinates using as input the initial wavefunction. The admissible solutions are those consistent with quasi-potential flow. The effect of the superposition principle is represented via a nonclassical force on each particle. The wavefunction is computed via the standard map between the Lagrangian coordinates and the Eulerian fields, which provides the analogue in this model of Huygens principle in wave mechanics. The method is illustrated by calculating the time-dependence of a free Gaussian wavefunction. The Eulerian and Lagrangian pictures are complementary descriptions of a quantum process in that they have associated Hamiltonian formulations that are connected by a canonical transformation. The de Broglie-Bohm interpretation, which employs {{the same set of}} trajectories, should not be conflated with the Lagrangian version of the hydrodynamic interpretation. The theory implies that the mathematical results of the de Broglie-Bohm model may be regarded as statements about quantum mechanics itself rather than about its interpretation.

40|$|In {{this work}} an extremal {{principle}} driving the far from equilibrium {{evolution of a}} system of structureless particles is derived by using the stochastic quantum <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>analogy.</b> For a classical phase (i. e., the quantum correlations decay on a distance smaller than the mean inter-molecular distance) the far from equilibrium kinetic equation can be cast {{in the form of a}} Fokker-Plank equation whose phase space velocity vector maximizes the dissipation of the energy-type function, named here, stochastic free energy. Near equilibrium the maximum stochastic free energy dissipation is shown to be compatible with the Prigogine s principle of minimum entropy production. Moreover, in the case of elastic molecular collisions and in absence of chemical reactions, in quasi-isothermal far from equilibrium states, the theory shows that the maximum stochastic free energy dissipation reduces to the maximum free energy dissipation. Following the tendency to reach the highest rate of stochastic free energy dissipation, the system transition to states with higher free energy can happen. Given that in incompressible ordinary fluids such an increase of free energy is almost given by a decrease of entropy, the matter self-organization becomes possible. When chemical reactions or relevant thermal gradients are present, the theory highlights that the Sawada enunciation of maximum free energy dissipation can be violated. The proposed model depicts the Prigogine s principle of minimum entropy production near-equilibrium and the far from equilibrium Sawada s principle of maximum energy dissipation as two complementary principia of a unique theory where the latter one is a particular case of the more general one of maximum stochastic free energy dissipation.

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} non-local {{property}} {{of quantum mechanics}} in the quantum <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>analogy</b> (QHA) given by Madelung. The role of the quantum potential in generating the non-local dynamics of quantum mechanics is analyzed. The work shows how in presence of noise the non-local properties {{as well as the}} quantization of the action are perturbed. The resulting stochastic QHA dynamics much depend by the strength of the interaction: Strongly bounded systems (such as linear ones) lead to quantum entangled stochastic behavior, while weakly bounded ones may be not able to maintain the quantum superposition of states on large distances and may loose their macro-scale quantum coherence acquiring the classical stochastic evolution. The work shows that in the frame of the stochastic approach it is possible to have freedom between quantum weakly bounded systems. The stochastic QHA model shows that the wave-function collapse to an eigenstates (deriving by interaction of a quantum microscopic system with a classical (macroscopic) one) can be described by the model itself as a kinetic quantum (relaxation) process to a stationary state. Since the time of the wave function decay to the eigenstate represents the minimum duration time of a measurement, the minimum uncertainty principle is shown to be compatible with the relativistic postulate about the light speed as the maximum velocity of transmission of interaction. About this topic, the paper shows that the Lorenz invariance of the relativistic quantum potential (coming from the Dirac equation) enforces the hypothesis that the superluminal transmission of information are not present in measurements on quantum entangled state.
