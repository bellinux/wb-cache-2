Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants. Crop residues (such as corn stalks, wheat straw and rice straw), wood waste, and municipal solid waste are potential sources of cellulosic biomass. Dedicated energy crops, such as switchgrass, are also promising cellulose sources that can be sustainably produced in many regions.|$|E

25|$|Another {{explanation}} is that longer maturities entail greater risks for the investor (i.e. the lender). A risk premium is needed by the market, since at longer durations there is more uncertainty and a greater chance of catastrophic events that impact the investment. This explanation depends {{on the notion that}} the economy faces more uncertainties in the distant <b>future</b> <b>than</b> in the near term. This effect {{is referred to as the}} liquidity spread. If the market expects more volatility in the future, even if interest rates are anticipated to decline, the increase in the risk premium can influence the spread and cause an increasing yield.|$|E

25|$|In psychology, {{capitalization}} {{refers to}} the process of drawing additional benefits (e.g., increases in good mood) from a positive event by sharing it with other people. Research shows that individuals who share news of a positive event (such as, for example, acceptance to graduate school or a promotion at work) with a close other and receive a supportive response from that person, show increases in positive emotions and personal well-being above and beyond the boost given by the positive event itself. Furthermore, support for positive event sharing has positive implications for relationship well-being. Specifically, receipt of such support increases feelings of trust and the endorsement of a more prosocial orientation (i.e., the willingness to respond positively in an unpleasant or conflict situation involving one's relationship partner). Additionally, support for positive event sharing is more strongly linked to higher levels of relationship quality and lower likelihood of break-ups in the <b>future</b> <b>than</b> support extended during discussion of negative events.|$|E
500|$|The {{output of}} {{forecast}} models based on atmospheric dynamics {{is unable to}} resolve some details of the weather near the Earth's surface. As such, a statistical relationship between the output of a numerical weather model and the ensuing conditions at the ground {{was developed in the}} 1970s and 1980s, known as model output statistics (MOS). [...] Starting in the 1990s, model ensemble forecasts have been used to help define the forecast uncertainty and to extend the window in which numerical weather forecasting is viable farther into the <b>future</b> <b>than</b> otherwise possible.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{opinions}} of the Millennium Group's role within the series have generally been negative, tending to focus on their inconsistent presentation. Writing in the collection Back to Frank Black: A Return to Chris Carter's Millennium, author Joseph Maddrey found that {{the changing nature of}} the Group's aims and methods seemed contradictory, writing that [...] "over the course of Seasons Two and Three, the Millennium Group appears to become more dedicated to promoting fear of the <b>future</b> <b>than</b> to fighting it". In another essay in this collection, Gordon Roberts described the Group as [...] "endlessly fascinating", and compared the Group to an organized crime syndicate, likening its requirement of continued devotion to the family unit.|$|E

30|$|One can {{conclude}} that while {{the circumstances in which}} welfare models operate have changed significantly, little is known about which welfare models are best suited to succeed in this altered environment. Driving factors of welfare policy have changed, which means that the fundamental premises of scenarios have to be changed.

500|$|Because {{the output}} of {{forecast}} models based on atmospheric dynamics requires corrections near ground level, model output statistics (MOS) were developed in the 1970s and 1980s for individual forecast points (locations). The MOS apply statistical techniques to post-process {{the output of}} dynamical models with the most recent surface observations and the forecast point's climatology. [...] This technique can correct for model resolution as well as model biases. [...] Even with the increasing power of supercomputers, the forecast skill of numerical weather models only extends to about two weeks into the future, since the density and quality of observationstogether with the chaotic nature of the partial differential equations {{used to calculate the}} forecastintroduce errors which double every five days. The use of model ensemble forecasts since the 1990s helps to define the forecast uncertainty and extend weather forecasting farther into the <b>future</b> <b>than</b> otherwise possible.|$|E
500|$|A more {{fundamental}} {{problem lies in}} the chaotic nature of the partial differential equations that govern the atmosphere. It is impossible to solve these equations exactly, and small errors grow with time (doubling about every five days). Present understanding is that this chaotic behavior limits accurate forecasts to about 14 days even with perfectly accurate input data and a flawless model. [...] In addition, the partial differential equations used in the model need to be supplemented with parameterizations for solar radiation, moist processes (clouds and precipitation), heat exchange, soil, vegetation, surface water, {{and the effects of}} terrain. [...] In an effort to quantify the large amount of inherent uncertainty remaining in numerical predictions, ensemble forecasts have been used since the 1990s to help gauge the confidence in the forecast, and to obtain useful results farther into the <b>future</b> <b>than</b> otherwise possible. This approach analyzes multiple forecasts created with an individual forecast model or multiple models.|$|E
500|$|Since the 1990s, {{ensemble}} forecasts {{have been}} used operationally (as routine forecasts) {{to account for the}} stochastic nature of weather processes ndash& that is, to resolve their inherent uncertainty. [...] This method involves analyzing multiple forecasts created with an individual forecast model by using different physical parametrizations or varying initial conditions. Starting in 1992 with ensemble forecasts prepared by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction, model ensemble forecasts {{have been used}} to help define the forecast uncertainty and to extend the window in which numerical weather forecasting is viable farther into the <b>future</b> <b>than</b> otherwise possible. The ECMWF model, the Ensemble Prediction System, uses singular vectors to simulate the initial probability density, while the NCEP ensemble, the Global Ensemble Forecasting System, uses a technique known as vector breeding. The UK Met Office runs global and regional ensemble forecasts where perturbations to initial conditions are produced using a Kalman filter. There are 24 ensemble members in the Met Office Global and Regional Ensemble Prediction System (MOGREPS).|$|E

500|$|... "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd" [...] {{was written}} {{ten years after}} {{publishing}} {{the first edition of}} Leaves of Grass (1855) and it reflects a maturing of Whitman's poetic vision from a drama of identity and romantic exuberance that has been tempered by his emotional experience of the American Civil War. Whitman included the poem as part of a quickly-written sequel to a collection of poems addressing the war that was being printed at the time of Lincoln's death. [...] These poems, collected under the title Drum-Taps and Sequel to Drum-Taps, range in emotional context from [...] "excitement to woe, from distant observation to engagement, from belief to resignation" [...] and [...] "more concerned with history than the self, more aware of the precariousness of America's present and <b>future</b> <b>than</b> of its expansive promise." [...] First published in autumn 1865, [...] "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd"—along with 42 other poems from Drum-Taps and Sequel to Drum-Taps—was absorbed into Leaves of Grass beginning with the fourth edition, published in 1867.|$|E
500|$|Neutral Milk Hotel {{formed in}} 1989 as an {{offshoot}} of Milk, a high school musical project of singer-songwriter Jeff Mangum, and the band was largely a Mangum solo project in the group's earlier days. The group {{was a part of}} The Elephant 6 Recording Company, a collective of musicians that includes, among others, notable indie rock bands The Apples in Stereo, The Olivia Tremor Control, and Of Montreal. The 1993 single [...] "Everything Is" [...] was the band's first release, and it would later be reissued as an EP with additional tracks. The band's first studio album, On Avery Island, was released on the independent label Merge, and has sold a relatively high 5,000 copies. Afterwards, the band began to tour for the first time, and grew to include horns player Scott Spillane, multi-instrumentalist Julian Koster, and drummer Jeremy Barnes. In 1998 the band released In the Aeroplane over the Sea on Merge, an album which has since {{become one of the most}} popular and acclaimed indie rock albums of the 1990s. Up until 2011's Ferris Wheel on Fire EP, the band had had no new releases since In the Aeroplane over the Sea, though Mangum has said [...] "I don't know what's going to happen, but I certainly want to make music a bigger part of my life in the <b>future</b> <b>than</b> it has been for the last couple of years." ...|$|E
500|$|Conceiving {{the initial}} script for Carnivàle between 1990 and 1992, Daniel Knauff set its plot in a {{carnival}} {{environment in the}} 1930s Dust Bowl, which he felt had not been dramatized as a series yet. He {{had grown up with}} a disabled father who was not commonly accepted as a normal human being. Freaks of the 1930s, however, who might not have found another place offering a <b>future</b> <b>than</b> a carnival, tended to be celebrities in the period. Daniel Knauf expanded the plot with a complex fictional universe based on a good versus evil theme, led by carnival healer Ben Hawkins and Brother Justin Crowe, a California preacher. In his story pitch to HBO, Knauf presented Carnivàle as a collection of media samples {{from the perspective of a}} fictional author trying to uncover Ben's mysterious story. These fictional samples consisted of interviews, diary entries, and various newspaper clippings, photos and book references forming the character biographies of all major Carnivàle characters. The character backgrounds were further developed before the filming of Carnivàle began, but were not made part of the show's visible structure. The audience would therefore only get to know the characters as a natural aspect in the story. The characters themselves are confronted with [...] "self-realization and becoming aware of these [...] powers and learning to harness them, and the implications of this battle between good and evil." [...] Seventeen actors received star billing in the first season; fifteen of whom were part of the carnival storyline. The second season amounted to thirteen main cast members, supplemented by several actors in recurring roles. Although such large casts make shows more expensive to produce, the writers have more flexibility in story decisions.|$|E
