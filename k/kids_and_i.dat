500|$|Matt Pryor {{continued}} {{as part of}} The New Amsterdams, an acoustic alt-country group he had formed in 2000, expanding its sound and solidifying its previously revolving-door lineup. In 2007 he formed The Terrible Twos, a children's band that has released two albums on Vagrant Records. Regarding the decision to make a children's album directly after the split, Pryor said [...] "I {{wanted to do it}} anyway because I have <b>kids</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> want to write songs for them, but nobody {{is going to be like}} 'this isn't as good as the old stuff.' It's immune to punk criticism." [...] In July 2008, he refocused his efforts on a solo career with the release of Confidence Man, an alt-country release similar in sound to The New Amsterdams. After his second album, May Day, Pryor announced that he would be formally disbanding The New Amsterdams in favor of his solo career, concluding the band's tenure with the release of Outroduction, a B-sides recording.|$|E

2500|$|The antagonists Grendel and Grendel's {{mother are}} portrayed by Crispin Glover and Angelina Jolie, respectively. Glover had {{previously}} worked with Zemeckis in Back to the Future, when he portrayed George McFly. Zemeckis had found Glover tiresome on set, {{because of his}} {{lack of understanding of}} shooting a film, but realized this would not be a problem as on a motion capture film he could choose his angles later. Glover's dialogue was entirely in Old English. Jolie had wanted to work with Zemeckis, and had read the poem years before but could not remember it well until she read the script and was able to recall basic themes. The actress recounted her first impression of her character's appearance by saying [...] "...I was told I {{was going to be a}} lizard. Then I was brought into a room with Bob, and a bunch of pictures and examples, and he showed me this picture of a woman half painted gold, and then a lizard.

2500|$|The show's {{most famous}} remark {{supposedly}} occurred as Groucho was interviewing Charlotte Story, who had borne 20 children. When Marx {{asked why she}} had chosen to raise such a large family, Mrs. Story {{is said to have}} replied, [...] "I love my husband"; to which Marx responded, [...] "I love my cigar, but I take it out of my mouth once in awhile." [...] The remark was judged too risqué to be aired, according to the anecdote, and was edited out before broadcast. [...] Charlotte Story and her husband Marion, indeed parents of 20 children, were real people who appeared on the program in 1950. Audio recordings of the interview exist, and a reference to cigars is made ("With each new kid, do you go around passing out cigars?"), but {{there is no evidence of}} the famous line. Marx and Fenneman both denied that the incident took place. [...] "I get credit all the time for things I never said," [...] Marx told Roger Ebert, in 1972. [...] "You know that line in You Bet Your Life? The guy says he has seventeen <b>kids</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> say, 'I smoke a cigar, but I take it out of my mouth occasionally'? [...] I never said that." [...] Marx's 1976 memoir recounts the episode as fact, but co-writer Hector Arce relied mostly on sources other than Groucho himself—who was by then in his mid eighties, in ill health [...] and [...] mentally compromised—and was probably unaware that Groucho had specifically denied making the legendary observation.|$|E
