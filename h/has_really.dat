5|$|It's a {{very passionate}} song. It's really, I think maybe, the most passionate {{one on the}} record. I mean, I'm really proud of it because that's really one that goes {{over-the-top}} {{in the sense that}} it's got images - it has religious imagery of resurrection, it's got images of fertility and rebirth, it <b>has</b> <b>really</b> very good sexual images, images of cars - which I always like.|$|E
5|$|Many fans of {{the show}} were outraged when Mercedes was {{supposedly}} murdered by Freddie Roscoe in November 2014, just a week after her sister Carmel died in a train crash. However, Jennifer Metcalfe stated that: 'Mercedes's departure is totally shrouded in mystery. Running up to the week where she exits, she <b>has</b> <b>really</b> annoyed pretty much everyone in the village, so it's 'who's done it?'. The story line was billed as a complete mystery, as the viewers don't completely know what happened between Mercedes and her killer on {{the night at the}} McQueen house, or whether or not she was actually dead.|$|E

When Shakuni discovers what <b>has</b> <b>really</b> happened, he blames Krishna. Satyaki, Arjuna's disciple, asks Shakuni to speak {{standing}} on a magical box. He proceeds {{to stand on the}} box, which makes him involuntarily explain the Kauravas' real intentions behind the marriage proposal. Ghatotkacha then reveals his identity.

They thank Ghatotkacha, who credits Krishna as the mastermind behind everything, including Abhimanyu and Sasirekha's marriage.|$|E

We <b>have</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> but {{a short period of}} service, for we wasted a week at Genoa, and ten days on our journey back here, so that we <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>really</b> no more than a month's active service." ...|$|R
5|$|Zelda now {{claims to}} be {{in direct contact with}} Christ, William the Conqueror, Mary Stuart, Apollo and all the stock {{paraphernalia}} of insane-asylum jokes... For what she <b>has</b> <b>really</b> suffered, there is never a sober night that I do not pay a stark tribute of an hour to in the darkness. In an odd way, perhaps incredible to you, she was always my child (it was not reciprocal as it often is in marriages)... I was her great reality, often the only liaison agent who could make the world tangible to her.|$|E

25|$|What {{it really}} {{highlights}} though is that nothing <b>has</b> <b>really</b> changed in our strategy, {{and that is}} that we need to re-equip, we need to grow our capacity, we need to have new products, so I think it just brings these objectives into focus more and more by having a high profile about what's happened.|$|E
25|$|The rivalry {{takes place}} in the Metropolitan Division. The two have been rivals since the Capitals joined the Patrick Division in 1979. The rivalry got really heated during the 1990s with these teams meeting three times in five seasons. However, the rivalry <b>has</b> <b>really</b> heated as of 2015 with five series within the last seven years.|$|E
25|$|But {{from the}} fact that capital posits every such limit as a barrier and hence gets ideally beyond it, it does not by any means follow that it <b>has</b> <b>really</b> {{overcome}} it, and, since every such barrier contradicts its character, its production moves in contradictions which are constantly overcome but just as constantly posited. Furthermore. The universality towards which it irresistibly strives encounters barriers in its own nature, which will, at a certain stage of its development, allow it to be recognized as being itself the greatest barrier to this tendency, and hence will drive towards its own suspension.|$|E

25|$|His {{technique}} is awesome! Even today, nobody <b>has</b> <b>really</b> {{come to the}} state that he was playing at. As good as players are, they haven’t gotten to where he is. There's {{a lot of guys}} that play fast and a lot of guys that play clean, and the guitar {{has come a long way}} as far as speed and clarity go, but nobody plays with the whole fullness of expression that Django has. I mean, the combination of incredible speed – all the speed you could possibly want – but also the thing of every note have a specific personality. You don’t hear it. I really haven’t heard it anywhere but with Django.|$|E

He tells Greenlee {{that he knows}} Zach and Reese have been sleeping together and {{that he does not}} want to be married next to them, but promises her that he will give her the wedding of her dreams.

However, Plucknett notes the distinction that in Cessavit 42, [...] "the statute is not held void; it is just ignored.

500|$|Despite {{the efforts}} of his supporters, Haywood was unable to {{overturn}} the conviction. In 1921, Haywood skipped bail while out on appeal and fled to Russia.

500|$|Since the book's {{original}} publication several {{scientists and}} publishers {{have written about}} Rhinogradentia as though Steiner's account were true, though {{it is unclear how}} many of those who continued and popularized the joke did so intentionally. Wulf Ankle wrote that the order [...] "is not a poetic invention, but <b>has</b> <b>really</b> lived". Erich von Holst celebrated the discovery of [...] "a completely new animal world". Timothy E. Lawlor's widely read textbook Handbook to the Orders and Families of Living Mammals, includes an entry for Rhinogradentia that does not acknowledge its fictional nature.|$|E

In a 1995 BBC Radio Merseyside interview, Kirchherr explained: [...] "My boyfriend, Klaus Voormann, had this hairstyle, and Stuart [...] liked it very, very much. He was the first one who really got the nerve to get the Brylcreem out of his hair, and asking me to cut his hair for him. Pete Best <b>has</b> <b>really</b> curly hair, and it wouldn't work".|$|E

[...] General Manager Daniels noted: [...] "Feldman <b>has</b> <b>really</b> saved our pen this year, and he wasn't a guy we were counting on in the beginning of the season." [...] The Rangers wanted to limit his use {{towards the end}} of the seaton, but had to keep him in the rotation because of injuries to the other pitchers.|$|E
