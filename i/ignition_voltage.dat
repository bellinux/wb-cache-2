50|$|HMI lamps {{can reach}} <b>ignition</b> <b>voltages</b> {{of up to}} 70,000 V when {{striking}} hot, and are considered very dangerous if miswired. It is good practice to strike {{the light from the}} ballast and not the head, in the event that there is a short circuit in the lamp head. Proper striking procedures should be followed as well, such as calling out a vocal warning whenever a light is turned on to warn persons in the area. Also, the header cable should be properly and securely connected. Nearly all present-day header cables are equipped with 'twist-lock' fittings at either end to ensure a safe and precise connection, both at the ballast and the lamp housing.|$|R

40|$|The testing {{procedures}} of the U. S. Mine Safety and Health Administration specify that intrinsic safety acceptance tests be conducted using a standard tungsten-cadmium electrode configuration in the break- flash apparatus. However, in realistic mining environments, other materials {{may be more likely}} sources of sparking. Information defining the probability of spark ignition between common materials such as aluminum, brass, copper, lead, tin, cold-rolled steel, and stainless steel is of more practical value in determining ignition hazards. The U. S. Bureau of Mines has completed an investigation of the influence of material on the ignition probability using the breakflash apparatus.

After warming up, when the volatile compound used for light emission is vaporized and the pressure increases, reignition of the discharge requires either significantly higher voltage or reducing the internal pressure by cooling down the lamp. For example, many sodium vapor lamps cannot be re-lit immediately after being shut off; they must cool down {{before they can be}} lit up again.|$|E
50|$|A simpler device, the {{low tension}} coil, {{was already in}} use for {{stationary}} engines and spark-ignition gas engines. This was a simple iron-core inductor, used with a battery and a switch called a contact breaker. It had a single winding and so was not a transformer like the trembler coil. When the piston was at the right point, the contact breaker opened, breaking the battery current. Self-induction due to the collapsing magnetic field generated a high voltage pulse in the coil, which {{was applied to the}} spark plug. The drawback of the low tension coil was that the high <b>ignition</b> <b>voltage</b> was generated in the same circuit as the low voltage battery current flowed in.|$|E

Used in fluorescent tubes with high power and short length, e.g. industrial lighting tubes. Has higher voltage drop {{in comparison with}} argon and krypton.

50|$|A typical CDI module {{consists}} of a small transformer, a charging circuit, a triggering circuit and a main capacitor. First, the system voltage is raised up to 250 to 600 volts by a power supply inside the CDI module. Then, the electric current flows to the charging circuit and charges the capacitor. The rectifier inside the charging circuit prevents capacitor discharge before the moment of ignition. When the triggering circuit receives the triggering signal, the triggering circuit stops {{the operation of the}} charging circuit, allowing the capacitor to discharge its output rapidly to the low inductance ignition coil. In a CD ignition, the ignition coil acts as a pulse transformer rather than an energy storage medium as it does in an inductive system. The voltage output to the spark plugs is highly dependent on the design of the CD <b>ignition.</b> <b>Voltages</b> exceeding the insulation capabilities of existing ignition components can lead to early failure of those components. Most CD ignitions are made to give very high output voltages, but this is not always beneficial. When there's no triggering signal, the charging circuit is re-connected to charge the capacitor.|$|R

40|$|Investigations of the arc {{splitting}} {{process in}} low-voltage arc chutes {{have shown that}} an <b>ignition</b> <b>voltage</b> has to be exceeded before new arc roots form on the splitter plates. When an arc spot has been formed, the electrode fall voltages are nearly constant and rather independent of the current. In simulations this behaviour can be modelled by {{a thin layer of}} elements with a nonlinear current density-voltage characteristic surrounding the splitter plate. An appropriate characteristic has al-ready been presented in earlier publications. It includes an <b>ignition</b> <b>voltage</b> at low current densities and a constant final voltage at higher current densities. In this paper, the influence of the magnitude of the <b>ignition</b> <b>voltage</b> is evaluated. A lower voltage peak yields a shorter arc loop around the lower edge of the splitter plate and an earlier subdivision of the arc. A too high voltage hump makes arc splitting impossible. To show that special treatment of the arc roots is absolutely necessary, a com-paring simulation without an arc root model was performed. The results are compared and verified on the basis of experimental results. Hence, the arc splitting process is analyzed concerning arc voltage and current through the plate as well as the location of arc roots. 1...|$|E
