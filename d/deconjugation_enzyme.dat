40|$|Serum {{concentrations}} of valproic acid (VPA) are markedly de-creased by coadministration of carbapenem antibiotics (CBPMs). Although inhibition of deconjugation of VPA-glucuronide (VPA-G) to VPA by CBPMs {{has been proposed}} {{as one of the}} mechanisms to account for this drug-drug interaction, little information is available on the mode of inhibition. In the present study, we characterized the enzyme involved in the deconjugation of VPA-G by using hu-man and rat liver cytosol. It is suggested that 1) deconjugation activity inhibited by CBPMs may be selective for VPA-G, 2) decon-jugation of VPA-G may be mediated by enzyme(s) other than -glu-curonidase, and 3) the irreversible inactivation may be responsible for the inhibition of deconjugation of VPA-G by CBPMs. Finally, the kinetic parameters for inactivation (Kapp and kinact) were deter-mined for four CBPMs of diverse structure from in vitro experi-ments. Based on the results of simulation analyses with these parameters and the degradation rate constant of the putative VPA-G <b>deconjugation</b> <b>enzyme</b> obtained from experiments using rats, it is probable that the <b>deconjugation</b> <b>enzyme</b> for VPA-G in the liver is rapidly and mostly inactivated by these CBPMs under clin-ical situations...|$|E
40|$|SummaryAutophagy {{involves}} de novo {{formation of}} double membrane-bound structures called autophagosomes, which engulf material to be degraded in lytic compartments. Atg 8 is a ubiquitin-like protein required for this process in Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{that can be}} conjugated to the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine by a ubiquitin-like system. Here, we show using an in vitro system that Atg 8 mediates the tethering and hemifusion of membranes, which are evoked by the lipidation of the protein and reversibly modulated by the <b>deconjugation</b> <b>enzyme</b> Atg 4. Mutational analyses suggest that membrane tethering and hemifusion observed in vitro represent an authentic function of Atg 8 in autophagosome formation in vivo. In addition, electron microscopic analyses indicate that these functions of Atg 8 {{are involved in the}} expansion of autophagosomal membranes. Our results provide further insights into the mechanisms underlying the unique membrane dynamics of autophagy and also indicate the functional versatility of ubiquitin-like proteins...|$|E
40|$|Nucleolus is {{a dynamic}} {{structure}} that controls biogenesis of ribosomal RNA and senses cellular stresses. Nucleolus contains a number of proteins including ribosomal proteins that conduct cellular stresses to downstream signaling such as p 53 pathway. Recently, {{it has been reported}} that modification by a ubiquitin-like molecule, Nedd 8, regulates subnuclear localization of ribosomal protein L 11. Most of L 11 is normally localized and neddylated in nucleolus. However, cellular stress triggers deneddylation and redistribution of L 11, and subsequent activation of p 53. Although Nedd 8 modification is thought to be important for L 11 localization, the mechanism of how neddylation of L 11 is regulated remains largely unknown. Here, we show that Myeloma overexpressed 2 (Myeov 2) controls L 11 localization through down-regulation of Nedd 8 modification. Expression of Myeov 2 reduced neddylation of proteins including L 11. We also found that Myeov 2 associates with L 11 and withholds L 11 in nucleoplasm. Although Myeov 2 interacted with a Nedd 8 <b>deconjugation</b> <b>enzyme</b> COP 9 signalosome, L 11 deneddylation was mediated by another deneddylase Nedp 1, independently of Myeov 2. Finally, p 53 transcriptional activity is upregulated by Myeov 2 expression. These data demonstrate that Myeov 2 hampers L 11 neddylation through their interactions and confines L 11 to nucleoplasm to modulate nucleolar integrity. Our findings provide a novel link between oncogenic stress and p 53 pathway and may shed light on the protective mechanism against cancer...|$|E

In addition, urinary metabolite formation in treated rats was partially assessed, as was microsomal enzyme induction {{as determined by}} hexobarbital sleep time assays. All test materials {{were found to be}} rapidly absorbed following gavage dosing with a biphasic diminution of blood radiolabel in the rat. As an apparent result of higher dosage levels, rhesiis monkeys exhibited both a delayed attainment of peak blood levels and a lower rate of elimination of blood “C. A minor portion (57 %) of urinary radioactivity from treated rats was not extractable with chloroform until incubation with <b>deconjugation</b> <b>enzymes</b> was conducted, releasing up to 50 %. The values for rhesus monkeys were 1542 % and SO%, respectively; the former valuesareapparentty elevated (relative to rat) due to saturation of conjugate-formation pathways. Decreases were observed for hexobarbital sleep times following 3 -day treatment with 50 mg/kg of each of the test compounds and, consistent with hepatomegaly observed in subchronic studies, suggest induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes. The study supports evidence that these chemicals are cleared primarily via the urine in a dose-dependent manner, and are conjugated to water-soluble metabolites in both rats and rhesus monkeys...|$|R
40|$|In unstimulated cells, the {{transcription}} factor NF-κB {{is held in}} the cytoplasm in an inactive state by IκB inhibitor proteins. Activation of NF [...] KB is mediated by signal induced degradation of IκBα via the ubiquitin proteasome-dependent pathway. Targeting the proteins for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis is an irrevocable decision, and as such, the process needs to be highly specific and tightly regulated. This task is achieved by conjugation and <b>deconjugation</b> <b>enzymes</b> that act in a dynamic and coordinated mechanism. In a yeast two hybrid screen designed to identify proteins involved in IκBα signalling Ubch 9 was found {{to interact with the}} N-terminal regulatory region of IκBα. Although Ubch 9 is an enzyme homologous to E 2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes we have shown that is unable to form a thioester with ubiquitin but it is capable to form a thioester with the small ubiquitin-like protein SUMO- 1. To fully characterise the SUMO- 1 modification reaction we have purified the proteins and cloned the genes encoding the SUMO- 1 activating enzyme (SAEl/SAE 2) and shown that it is homologous to enzymes involved in the activation of ubiquitin, Smt 3 p, the yeast SUMO- 1 homologue, and Rublp/Nedd 8, another ubiquitin-like protein. SUMO- 1 is conjugated to target proteins by a pathway that is distinct from, but analogous to, ubiquitin conjugation. SUMO- 1 was efficiently conjugated, both in vivo and in vitro, to IκBα on lysine 21, which is also utilised for ubiquitin modification. Thus, by blocking ubiquitination SUMO- 1 modification acts antagonistically to generate a pool of IκBα resistant to proteasome-mediated degradation which consequently inhibits NF-κB dependent transcription activation. In view of several lines of similarity between NF-kB and p 53, the involvement of SUMO- 1 modification in the metabolism of the tumour supressor p 53 was investigated. We have shown that p 53 is modified by SUMO- 1 at a single site, lysine 386 in the C-terminus of p 53. Although p 53 is regulated by ubiquitination, SUMO- 1 and ubiquitin modification do not compete for the same lysine in p 53. However, overexpression of SUMO- 1 activates {{the transcription}}al activity of wild type p 53, but not K 386 R p 53 where the SUMO- 1 acceptor site has been mutated. A consensus sequence was obtained by comparison of the sequences surrounding the SUMO- 1 acceptor lysine in proteins that {{have been shown to be}} modified by SUMO- 1 and revealed a possible recognition site for SUMO- 1 conjugation machinery. Tagging of proteins with SUMO- 1 regulates transcriptional activation, either by interfering with subcellular location or with the ubiquitination pathway. The pathway may represent a novel target for drug development...|$|R
40|$|Giardiasis, {{currently}} {{considered a}} neglected disease, {{is caused by}} the intestinal protozoan parasite Giardia duodenalis and is widely spread in human as well as domestic and wild animals. The lack of appropriate medications and the spread of resistant parasite strains urgently call for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Host microbiota or certain probiotic strains have the capacity to provide some protection against giardiasis. By combining biological and biochemical approaches, {{we have been able to}} decipher a molecular mechanism used by the probiotic strain Lactobacillus johnsonii La 1 to prevent Giardia growth in vitro. We provide evidence that the supernatant of this strain contains active principle(s) not directly toxic to Giardia but able to convert non-toxic components of bile into components highly toxic to Giardia. By using bile acid profiling, these components were identified as deconjugated bile-salts. A bacterial bile-salt-hydrolase of commercial origin was able to mimic the properties of the supernatant. Mass spectrometric analysis of the bacterial supernatant identified two of the three bile-salt-hydrolases encoded in the genome of this probiotic strain. These observations document a possible mechanism by which L. johnsonii La 1, by secreting or releasing BSH-like activity(ies) in the vicinity of replicating Giardia in an environment where bile is present and abundant, can fight this parasite. This discovery has both fundamental and applied outcomes to fight giardiasis, based on local delivery of deconjugated bile salts, <b>enzyme</b> <b>deconjugation</b> of bile components, or natural or recombinant probiotic strains that secrete or release such deconjugating activities in a compartment where both bile salts and Giardia are present...|$|R
40|$|A Novel cardiac {{function}} of SUMO 2 / 3 and SENP 5 dependent pathway and its physiologic impact on congestive cardiomyopathy Publication No. ___________ Eun Young Kim, M. S. Supervisory professor: Robert J. Schwartz, Ph. D. SUMOylation regulates diverse cellular processes including transcription, cell cycle, protein stability, and apoptosis. Although SUMO 1 {{has been extensively}} studied so far, relevance of SUMO 2 / 3 is unclear, especially in heart. Here we show that failing heart induces SUMO 2 / 3 conjugation. Increased SUMO 2 / 3 -dependent modification leads to congestive heart disease such as cardiac hypertrophy by promoting cardiac cell death. Calpain 2 and Calpastatin as a novel SUMO 2 targets {{have been known to}} be involved in mitochondrial-independent cell death pathway in heart. These SUMOylations of Calpain 2 and Calpastatin facilitate activation of Calpain 2 by reducing inhibitory role of Calpastatin. These findings identify a SUMO 2 / 3 -dependent modification as a novel posttranslational modification that controls Calpain 2 -Calpastatin system resulting in cardiac protein degradation. On the other hand, transgenic mice overexpressing SENP 5, SUMO 2 / 3 -specific <b>deconjugation</b> <b>enzyme</b> in the heart, developed dilated cardiomyopathy. This unexpected phenotype mimics human heart failure, which has elevated SENP 5 protein levels. Dilated hearts of SENP 5 transgenic mice showed markedly reduced functions of mitochondrial complexes due to almost complete loss of mitochondrial cristae, and compromised cardiac energy metabolism. These hearts also showed increased deSUMOylation of mitochondrial proteins including dynamin related protein (Drp 1), which leads to nuclear translocation of mitochondrial apoptosis inducing factor (AIF). This induces massive loss of cardiomyocytes via caspase-independent apoptotic pathway. These findings identify a novel SENP 5 -mediated deSUMOylation pathway that controls mitochondrial structure and pathological remodeling of the heart. Thus, inhibiting SENP 5 might be beneficial to dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure...|$|E
40|$|Drought {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{environmental}} stresses that produces adverse effects on plants. Vast areas of agricultural land is susceptible to drought. Drought induced yield loss of crops has negative effects on the economy of a country. Among phytohormones, Abscisic Acid (ABA) induces abiotic stress tolerance in plants, and directs a complex regulatory network involving multiple transporters, up-regulation of ABA biosynthesis genes and various signalling pathways that enable plants to withstand low water availability. The current study was designed to understand ABA synthesis, its transport across the plant during stress and its mechanism to induce stomatal closure by using different in silico tools, because the complete ABA mediated drought tolerance has not yet been reported. In the current study, seven transporters, four ABA biosynthesis enzymes, <b>deconjugation</b> <b>enzyme</b> and a core complex of ABA signalling was verified through Modeller 9. 10 and Molecular Operating Environment (MOE). The Intel [R] Xenon [R] CPU-E 5420 @ 2. 50 GHz system with 4 GB of RAM and the 11. 4 (X 86 _ 64) operating system was used for molecular docking. Protein-ligand interactions were analysed by the LigPolt feature of MOE. Docking studies helped to understand the behaviour of ABA biosynthesis enzymes, ABA transporters and ABA core complex, which in turn helps to comprehend the whole mechanism of ABA synthesis in plants during drought stress. Computational models of AtABCG 11, AtBG 1, AtABCG 12,AtABCB 14,AtABCG 22,AtABCG 25,AtABCG 32, AtABCG 40, NCED, ABA 2 and AAO were used for docking. Docking analysis has shown promising results for all the models, except AtABCG 11 and AtABCG 12. Residues of AtABCG 11 and AtABCG 12 did not show binding with the ABA, as these transporters are involved in cuticle formation. Findings of this study will strengthen the work on ABA drought tolerance in plants and help to produce drought resistant crops globally...|$|E
40|$|In October 2012, a {{group of}} {{scientists}} met at the 10 th Meeting of the International Scientific Association of Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) in Cork, Ireland to discuss issues surrounding prebiotics and their development. This article summarises outputs from the meeting. Various prebiotic definitions were discussed and how the concept has evolved from targeting the colonic microbiome, through to the entire gastrointestinal tract and finally the ISAPP definition, which specifies fermentation as a key criterion. Structure and function relationships are becoming clearer with effects upon microbial diversity, determinations of selectivity and enhanced biological activity being major outcomes. Immune modulation and metal chelation were further facets. Biomass can be a useful, and economic, means of generating new prebiotics. Pectic oligomers from citrus are model examples. Testing aspects range from in vitro batch culture fermenters to multiple stage models, immobilized systems, animal, cellular studies and human trials. Analytical processes around microbiota characterization and functionality were compared. Human studies were seen as the definitive outcome, including 13 C labeling of key interventions. For extra intestinal effects, atopic disease, respiratory infections, vaginal issues, oral disease, adiposity, liver damage and skin infections are all feasible. The general outcome was that microbiota modulation was the key mechanism that linked these interactions. In pet food applications, the market potential for prebiotics is huge. Health targets {{are similar to those of}} humans. Issues include monomeric composition, chain length, linkages, branching, microbiota beyond bifidobacteria, metabolic function, mechanisms of health effects. Molecular biology has unraveled some of the explanations for prebiotic influences e. g. gene clusters to show transporters, regulators, permeases, hydrolases, lacS. In Lactobacillus ruminis, fermentation studies have been aligned to genome annotations, showing an energy efficient and rapid transport of GOS. In bifidobacteria, functional genome analyses have demonstrated uptake of trisaccharides. Questions relating to patients were then raised. For example, are prebiotics related to disease treatment or health maintenance? If a prebiotic does not change the microbiota, then how does it operate? Case study trials in Inflammatory Bowel Disease were presented on patient access to prebiotics and information. These showed that their knowledge of prebiotics was poor, compared to probiotics. The group then discussed the next generation of prebiotics (e. g. anti-adhesive activities). The comparator was Human Milk Oligosaccharides, which both reduce adherence of pathogens and act as prebiotics. Studies with galactooligosacchardes (GOS) have used pyrosequencing to demonstrate varying species level effects. This has relevance for infant formulae. Prebiotic aspects of whole foods and their complexity was covered. Trials were described where cross feeding and co-metabolism had been investigated. Suggestions on other prebiotic influences, aside from bifidobacteria, were made and included metagenomics, metabonomics, gene expression, mRNA global sequencing, bile <b>deconjugation,</b> <b>enzyme</b> profiles, lipids, phenolics. The discussion suggested how prebiotics could move forward with a wider expansion of the concept, target populations, expanded microorganisms, health benefits, application of new technologies and improved consumer understanding being the main goals.

40|$|Gut lumen {{serotonin}} (5 -hydroxytryptamine: 5 -HT) {{contributes to}} several gastrointestinal {{functions such as}} peristaltic reflexes. 5 -HT is released from enterochromaffin (EC) cells {{in response to a}} number of stimuli, including signals from the gut microbiota. However, the specific mechanism by which the gut microbiota regulates 5 -HT levels in the gut lumen has not yet been clarified. Our previous work with gnotobiotic mice showed that free catecholamines can be produced by the deconjugation of conjugated catecholamines; hence, we speculated that <b>deconjugation</b> by bacterial <b>enzymes</b> {{may be one of the}} mechanisms whereby gut microbes can produce free 5 -HT in the gut lumen. In this study, we tested this hypothesis using germ-free (GF) mice and gnotobiotic mice recolonized with specific pathogen-free (SPF) fecal flora (EX-GF). The 5 -HT levels in the lumens of the cecum and colon were significantly lower in the GF mice than in the EX-GF mice. Moreover, these levels were rapidly increased, within only 3 days after exposure to SPF microbiota. The majority of 5 -HT was in an unconjugated, free form in the EX-GF mice, whereas approximately 50 % of the 5 -HT was found in the conjugated form in the GF mice. These results further support the current view that the gut microbiota plays a crucial role in promoting the production of biologically active, free 5 -HT. The deconjugation of glucuronide-conjugated 5 -HT by bacterial enzymes is likely one of the mechanisms contributing to free 5 -HT production in the gut lumen...|$|R
40|$|Some {{intervention}} {{studies have}} shown that quercetin supplementation can regulate certain biomarkers, {{but it is not clear}} how the doses given relate to dietary quercetin (e. g. from onion). We conducted a two-period, two-sequence crossover study to compare the bioavailability of quercetin when administered in the form of a fresh red onion meal (naturally glycosylated quercetin) or dietary supplement (aglycone quercetin) under fasting conditions. Six healthy, non-smoking, adult males with BMI 22. 7 ± 4. 0 kg m(- 2) and age 35. 3 ± 12. 3 y were grouped to take the two study meals in random order. In each of the 2 study periods, one serving of onion soup (made from 100 g fresh red onion, providing 156. 3 ± 3. 4 μmol (47 mg) quercetin) or a single dose of a quercetin dihydrate tablet (1800 ± 150 μmol (544 mg) of quercetin) were administered following 3 d washout. Urine samples were collected up to 24 h, and after <b>enzyme</b> <b>deconjugation,</b> quercetin was quantified by LC-MS. The 24 h urinary excretion of quercetin (1. 69 ± 0. 79 μmol) from red onion in soup was not significantly different to that (1. 17 ± 0. 44 μmol) for the quercetin supplement tablet (P = 0. 065, paired t-test). This means that, in practice, 166 mg of quercetin supplement would be comparable to about 10 mg of quercetin aglycone equivalents from onion. These data allow intervention studies on quercetin giving either food or supplements to be more effectively compared...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the physicochemical/biological properties and the effects of acute administration of N-ethyl-tauroursodeoxycholic acid in bile-fistula rats. In vitro determination of high-performance liquid chromatography mobility, octanol/ water partitioning, cholesterol solubilizing capacity, and sensitivity to <b>enzyme</b> <b>deconjugation</b> by bacteria and cholylglycine-hydroxylase were performed. In vivo determination of the following was also performed: (1) maximum secretory rate (SRmax) and choleretic/secretory properties during intravenous (IV) administration; (2) site/ extent of absorption, effects on bile flow, lipid secretion, and biotransformations after intraduodenal infusion. N-ethyl-tauroursodeoxycholate has a lipophilicity slightly higher than tauroursodeoxycholate, close to taurocholate, and similar cholesterol solubilizing capacity. Deconjugation of N-ethyl-tauroursodeoxycholate was 3. 4 +/- 2. 1 % after 72 hours, that of tauroursodeoxycholate was 100 % after 24 hours. During IV infusion of 300 nmol/min/ 100 g, biliary secretion of N-ethyl-tauroursodeoxycholic and tauroursodeoxycholic acids averaged 185 +/- 76 (standard deviation) nmol/min/ 100 g and 221 +/- 77 nmol/min/ 100 g (not significant). Increasing infusion rates caused progressive enhancement of bile flow and bile salt secretion until the SRmax was reached (1, 305 +/- 240 nmol/min/ 100 g for N-ethyl-tauroursodeoxycholic acid and 3, 240 nmol/min/ 100 g for tauroursodeoxycholate). The two bile salts were similarly choleretic. IV feeding of N-ethyl-tauroursodeoxycholic promoted a greater lipid secretion than tauroursodeoxycholate.

40|$|Primary human hepatocytes are a scarce {{resource}} with variable function, which diminishes {{with time}} in culture. As a consequence {{their use in}} tissue modelling and therapy is restricted. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) could provide a stable source of human tissue due to their properties of self-renewal {{and their ability to}} give rise to all three germ layers. hESCs have the potential to provide an unlimited supply of hepatic endoderm (HE) which could offer efficient tools for drug discovery, disease modelling and therapeutic applications. In order to create a suitable environment to enhance HE formation, hESC culture needed to be standardised. As such, a media trail was carried out to define serum free media capable of maintaining hESC in a pluripotent undifferentiated state. We also ensured hESC cultured in the various media could be directly differentiated to HE in a reproducible and efficient manner. The project then focused on the effect of post-translational modifications (PTMs), specifically SUMOylation, in hepatocyte differentiation and its subsequent manipulation to enhance HE viability. SUMOylation is a PTM known to modify a large number of proteins that play a role in various cellular processes including: cell cycle regulation, gene transcription, differentiation and cellular localisation. We hypothesised that SUMO modification may not only regulate hESC self renewal, but also maybe required for efficient hESC differentiation. We therefore interrogated the role of SUMOylation in hESC differentiation to hepatic endoderm (HE). hESC were differentiated and the cellular lysates were analysed by Western blotting for key proteins which modulate the conjugation and de conjugation of SUMO. We demonstrate that peak levels of SUMOylation were detectable in hESC populations and during cellular differentiation to definitive endoderm (DE), day 5. Following commitment to DE we observed a decrease in the level of SUMO modified proteins during cellular specialisation to a hepatic fate, corresponding with an increase in SENP 1, a SUMO <b>deconjugation</b> <b>enzyme.</b> We also detected reduced levels of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 α (HNF 4 α), a critical regulator of hepatic status and metabolic function, as SUMOylation decreased. As a result, we investigated if HNF 4 α was SUMOylated and if this process was involved in modulating HNF 4 α’s critical role in HE. HNF 4 α is an important transcription factor involved in liver organogenesis during development and is a key regulator for efficient adult liver metabolic functions. We observed a decreasing pattern of HNF 4 α expression at day 17 of our differentiation protocol in conjunction with a decrease in SUMO modified proteins. In order to further investigate and validate a role of SUMOylation on HNF 4 α stability Immunoprecipitation (IP) was employed. HNF 4 α protein was pulled down and probed for SUMO 2. Results show an increase in the levels of SUMO 2 modification as the levels of HNF 4 α decrease. Through deletion and mutation analysis we demonstrated that SUMO modification of HNF 4 α was restricted to the C-terminus on lysine 365. Protein degradation via the proteasome was responsible for the decrease in HNF 4 α, demonstrated by the use of a proteasome 26 S inhibitor MG 132. Additionally, a group at the University of Dundee has shown that polySUMOylation of promyelocytic leukaemia protein (PML) leads to its subsequent ubiquitination via RNF 4, an ubiquitin E 3 ligase, driving its degradation. Using an in vitro ubiquitination assay, we show that polySUMOylated HNF 4 α is preferentially ubiquitinated in the presence of RNF 4. Overall polySUMOylation of HNF 4 α may reduce its stability by driving its degradation, hence regulating protein activity. In conclusion, polySUMOylation of HNF 4 α is associated with its stability. HNF 4 α is subsequently important for HE differentiation both driving the formation of the hepatocytes and in maintaining a mature phenotype, in agreement with a number of different laboratories. Creating the ideal environment for sustaining mature functional hepatocytes, primary and those derived from hESCs and iPSCs, is essential for further use in applications such as drug screening, disease modelling and extracorporeal devices.

40|$|A {{systematic}} analysis of prokaryotic ubiquitin-related beta-grasp fold proteins provides {{new insights into}} the Ubiquitin family functional history. BACKGROUND. Ubiquitin (Ub) -mediated signaling is one of the hallmarks of all eukaryotes. Prokaryotic homologs of Ub (ThiS and MoaD) and E 1 ligases have been studied in relation to sulfur incorporation reactions in thiamine and molybdenum/tungsten cofactor biosynthesis. However, there is no evidence for entire protein modification systems with Ub-like proteins and <b>deconjugation</b> by deubiquitinating <b>enzymes</b> in prokaryotes. Hence, the evolutionary assembly of the eukaryotic Ub-signaling apparatus remains unclear. RESULTS. We systematically analyzed prokaryotic Ub-related β-grasp fold proteins using sensitive sequence profile searches and structural analysis. Consequently, we identified novel Ub-related proteins beyond the characterized ThiS, MoaD, TGS, and YukD domains. To understand their functional associations, we sought and recovered several conserved gene neighborhoods and domain architectures. These included novel associations involving diverse sulfur metabolism proteins, siderophore biosynthesis and the gene encoding the transfer mRNA binding protein SmpB, as well as domain fusions between Ub-like domains and PIN-domain related RNAses. Most strikingly, we found conserved gene neighborhoods in phylogenetically diverse bacteria combining genes for JAB domains (the primary de-ubiquitinating isopeptidases of the proteasomal complex), along with E 1 -like adenylating enzymes and different Ub-related proteins. Further sequence analysis of other conserved genes in these neighborhoods revealed several Ub-conjugating enzyme/E 2 -ligase related proteins. Genes for an Ub-like protein and a JAB domain peptidase were also found in the tail assembly gene cluster of certain caudate bacteriophages. CONCLUSION. These observations imply that members of the Ub family had already formed strong functional associations with E 1 -like proteins, UBC/E 2 -related proteins, and JAB peptidases in the bacteria. Several of these Ub-like proteins and the associated protein families are likely to function together in signaling systems just as in eukaryotes.
