40|$|Modifying {{substrate}} specificity of β-glucuronidase (GUS) {{would be helpful}} in various enzyme prodrug systems in delivering drug dose {{to the site of}} action in the cancer treatment. Due to the presence of endogenous enzyme in human tissues, GUS-based Antibody-Directed Enzyme Prodrug Therapy (ADEPT) requires a novel substrate to avoid undesirable systemic activation. GUS is a glycosyl hydrolase, highly specific towards the glucuronide derivatives. It catalyzes the glycosidic cleavage of β-D-glucuronides to β-D-glucuronic acid and aglycone moiety. In order to gain insight on the {{substrate specificity}} of GUS, C 6 carboxyl group of glucuronic acid was modified to C 6 carboxamide (amide derivative). We have examined amide derivatized substrates with a variety of different aglycone groups including p-nitrophenyl, phenyl and 4 -methylumbelliferone to further probe the activity profile of GUS. In an effort to optimize GUS activity, docking studies have been performed which indicated that amino acid point mutations near C 6 carboxyl group of glucuronic acid could improve binding of the derivatized substrates. As a result point mutations to Arg- 562 and Lys- 568 which make the active site less positively charged either by glutamine or glutamate lead to an enzyme with much lower native substrate activity but abolished activity for the amide-derivatized substrate. This research study showed that there is still a further need of finding appropriate mutations required to make <b>glucuronamide</b> a better substrate for the mutated version of GUS...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{synthesis}} and solid state analysis of carbohydrate derivatives, including many novel compounds. Although the synthetic chemistry surrounding carbohydrates is well established in the literature, the crystal chemistry of carbohydrates is less well studied. Therefore this research aims to improve understanding of the solid state properties of carbohydrate derivatives through gaining more information on their supramolecular bonding. Chapter One focuses on an introduction to the solid state of organic compounds, with a background to crystallisation, including issues that can arise during crystal growth. Chapter Two is based on glucopyranuronate derivatives which are understudied in terms of their solid state forms. This chapter reports on the formation of novel <b>glucuronamides</b> and utilising the functionality of the amide bond for crystallisation. TEMPO oxidation was completed to form glucopyranuronates by oxidation of the primary alcohol groups of glucosides to the carboxylic acid derivatives, to increase functionality for enhanced crystal growth. Chapter Three reports on the synthesis of glucopyranoside derivatives by O-glycosylation reactions and displays crystal structures, including a number of previously unsolved acetate protected and deprotected crystal structures. More complex glycoside derivatives were also researched in an aim to study the resultant supramolecular motifs. Chapter Four contains the synthesis of aryl cellobioside derivatives including the novel crystal structures that were solved for the acetate protected and deprotected compounds. Research was carried out to determine if 1 -deoxycellodextrins could act as putative isostructures for cellulose. Our research displays the presence of isostructural references with 1 -deoxycellotriose shown to be similar to cellulose III 11, 1 -deoxycellotetraose correlates with cellulose IV 11 and 1 -deoxycellopentose shows isostructurality similar to that of cellulose II. Chapter Five contains the full experimental details and spectral characterisation of all novel compounds synthesised in this project and relevant crystallographic information...|$|R
40|$|Background: Corn stover is {{lignocellulosic}} biomass {{that has}} {{potential to be}} used as raw material for bioethanol production. In the current research, dilute ammonia pretreatment was used to improve the accessibility of corn stover carbohydrates to subsequently added hydrolytic enzymes. Some carbohydrates, however, were still present after enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation. Hence, this research was aimed to characterise the recalcitrant carbohydrates, especially the oligosaccharides that remained after hydrolysis and fermentation of dilute ammonia-pretreated corn stover (DACS). Results: About 35 % (w/w) of DACS carbohydrates remained after enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation of the released monosaccharides. One-third of these recalcitrant carbohydrates were water soluble and composed of diverse oligosaccharides. By using UHPLC-MS n, more than 50 oligosaccharides were detected. Glucurono-xylooligosaccharides (UAXOS) with a degree of polymerisation (DP) less than 5 were the most abundant oligosaccharides. The (4 -O-methyl) glucuronosyl substituent was mostly attached onto the terminal xylosyl residue. It was shown that the glucuronosyl substituent in some UAXOS was modified into a hexenuronosyl, a <b>glucuronamide</b> or a hexenuronamide residue due to the dilute ammonia pretreatment. Another group of abundant oligosaccharides comprised various xyloglucan oligosaccharides (XGOS), with a DP 5 annotated as XXG as the most pronounced. In addition, disaccharides annotated as xylosyl-glucose with different β linkages as well as larger carbohydrates were present in the fermentation slurry. Conclusions: Around one-third of the 35 % (w/w) recalcitrant DACS carbohydrates remained as water-soluble saccharides. In this study, more than 50 recalcitrant oligosaccharides were detected, which mostly composed of xylosyl and/or glucosyl residues. The most pronounced oligosaccharides were UAXOS and XGOS. Hence, α-glucuronidase and α-xylosidase were suggested {{to be added to the}} enzyme mixture to degrade these oligosaccharides further, and hence the fermentation yield is potentially increased. </p...|$|E
