All of the {{mistakes}} were allowed to be there, which was the same for the song. The way that the song was recorded was very live. We played everything live, we didn't stop to edit ourselves, it was very intuitive and I wanted the video to have that energy, as well.|$|E

Using Fort Saskatchewan as a staging point, they batched natural gas liquids through Interprovincial’s oil pipeline to Sarnia. In 1980, the partnership added fractionation facilities at Fort Saskatchewan.|$|E

Schoolchildren are not afraid of “Foma”, as the P. E.

By his arts, he calls a herd of deer to come and graze around him.|$|E
