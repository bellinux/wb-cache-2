5|$|Watts {{has stated}} that the WWF {{intended}} to have Tekno Team 2000 win the WWF Tag Team Championship after two months in the promotion. After Watts' father, Bill Watts, began booking matches, the team was later sent to developmental territories to improve their skills. They returned to USWA in Tennessee, where they had wrestled a tag team match together in April 1995 under their real names. Competing as Tekno Team 2000, they defeated PG-13 on September 18. They began losing matches, however, while facing PG-13, The Heavenly Bodies, and The Bushwhackers. On October 30, Troy and Travis reversed their fortunes and defeated <b>King</b> <b>Cobra</b> and Spellbinder.|$|E

5|$|Kerala's fauna are {{notable for}} their {{diversity}} and {{high rates of}} endemism: it includes 118 species of mammals (1 endemic), 500 species of birds, 189 species of freshwater fish, 173 species of reptiles (10 of them endemic), and 151 species of amphibians (36 endemic). These are threatened by extensive habitat destruction, including soil erosion, landslides, salinisation, and resource extraction. In the forests, sonokeling, Dalbergia latifolia, anjili, mullumurikku, Erythrina, and Cassia number {{among the more than}} 1,000 species of trees in Kerala. Other plants include bamboo, wild black pepper, wild cardamom, the calamus rattan palm, and aromatic vetiver grass, Vetiveria zizanioides. Indian elephant, Bengal tiger, Indian leopard, Nilgiri tahr, common palm civet, and grizzled giant squirrels are also found in the forests. Reptiles include the <b>king</b> <b>cobra,</b> viper, python, and mugger crocodile. Kerala's birds include the Malabar trogon, the great hornbill, Kerala laughingthrush, darter and southern hill myna.

5000|$|The <b>king</b> <b>cobra's</b> generic name, Ophiophagus is a Greek-derived {{word that}} means [...] "snake-eater", and its diet {{consists}} primarily of other snakes, including rat snakes, small pythons, and even other venomous snakes such as {{various members of}} the true cobras (of the genus Naja), and the krait. When food is scarce, they may also feed on other small vertebrates, such as lizards, birds, and rodents. In some cases, the cobra may [...] "constrict" [...] its prey, such as birds and larger rodents, using its muscular body, though this is uncommon. After a large meal, the snake may live for many months without another one because of its slow metabolic rate. The <b>king</b> <b>cobra's</b> most common meal is the rat snake; pursuit of this species often brings <b>king</b> <b>cobras</b> close to human settlements.|$|R
50|$|Large Indian pythons and <b>king</b> <b>cobras</b> {{are found}} here. An endemic frog Bufo koyanansis has its only habitat in this {{protected}} area.|$|R

5000|$|Some {{scientists}} believe that the temperament of this species has been grossly exaggerated. In most of the local encounters with live, wild <b>king</b> <b>cobras,</b> the snakes appear to be of rather placid disposition, and they usually end up being killed or subdued with hardly any hysterics. These {{support the view that}} wild <b>king</b> <b>cobras</b> generally have a mild temperament, and despite their frequent occurrence in disturbed and built-up areas, are adept at avoiding humans. Naturalist Michael Wilmer Forbes Tweedie felt that [...] "this notion is based on the general tendency to dramatise all attributes of snakes with little regard for the truth about them. A moment’s reflection shows that this must be so, for the species is not uncommon, even in populated areas, and consciously or unconsciously, people must encounter <b>king</b> <b>cobras</b> quite frequently. If the snake were really habitually aggressive, records of its bite would be frequent; as it is they are extremely rare." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{species is}} {{classified}} as Vulnerable by the IUCN due to pressure from harvesting for meat, skin and use in traditional medicine, and because of increasing loss of habitat to deforestation.

25|$|The fangs, {{which are}} {{enlarged}} and hollow, {{are the first}} two teeth on each maxillary bone. Usually only one fang is in place on each side at any time. The maxilla is intermediate in both length and mobility between typical colubrids (long, less mobile) and viperids (very short, highly mobile). When the mouth is closed, the fangs fit into grooved slots in the buccal floor and usually below {{the front edge of}} the eye and are angled backwards; some elapids (Acanthophis, taipan, mamba, and <b>king</b> <b>cobra)</b> have long fangs on quite mobile maxillae and can make fast strikes.|$|E
