The methane gas and deionized water are injected into the pressure vessel to synthesize methane hydrate. The grain sizes of the quartz sand in the vessel are between 300 and 450 mu m.

40|$|A {{pilot scale}} {{simulation}} is performed for enhanced oil recovery by CO 2 injection to M field in Indonesia. CO 2 stimulation (<b>Huff</b> <b>and</b> <b>Puff)</b> method is {{considered as one}} of the most successful processes to increase oil recovery. Prior to the CO 2 injection, water is injected to support an additional reservoir pressure. 1, 000 tons of CO 2 are injected into M- 19 well for 50 days. After 30 days of soaking, production is resumed and continued for 10 years. Cumulative oil recovery from <b>Huff</b> <b>and</b> <b>Puff</b> process is increased by 2 % compared with primary production, mainly due to viscosity reduction observed near the well. The oil viscosity near the wellbore is reduced by 26 % due to the dissolved CO 2 gas. To maximize the oil recovery from CO 2 <b>Huff</b> <b>and</b> <b>Puff</b> process, the operating conditions are optimized. The design parameters include water injection rate, CO 2 injection rate, water injection time, and soaking time. Through optimization based on DECE, the oil recovery is increased by 12 % and 9. 8 % compared with primary production and stimulated case without optimization, respectively. The oil viscosity decreases by 70 % though CO 2 soaking area is smaller than that of non-optimized case. This study shows that CO 2 <b>Huff</b> <b>and</b> <b>Puff</b> method has a potential to improve oil recovery and optimized operating design is needed to produce more oil...|$|R

The descending order of the sensitivity injection parameters during steam <b>huff</b> <b>and</b> <b>puff</b> of herringbone well is concluded. Cycle steam injection volume is the most important parameter which affects the productivity of herringbone well, and the sequence of other parameters is steam dryness, steam injection rate and soak time. As a result, the steam in-jection parameters are optimized. Optimization results are as follows: cycle steam injection volume is 7000 t, steam dry-ness is greater than 50 %, steam injection rate is 600 t/d, and soak time is 4 to 7 days...|$|R

The simulation results indicate that desirable gas-to-water ratio and energy efficiency can be obtained under suitable injection and production conditions in the <b>huff</b> <b>and</b> <b>puff</b> process. However, the absolute gas production rate remains low during the whole production process. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the gas production performance is strongly dependent on the intrinsic permeability of the hydrate deposits, the sediment porosity, the injection and production rates, the temperature of the injected water, the irreducible water saturation and P- 01. The relative permeability exponents appear to have limited effect on the gas production behavior using the <b>huff</b> <b>and</b> <b>puff</b> method. The sensitivity analysis also indicates that the production potential of the natural gas hydrate deposit will be better than that of pure methane hydrate in this simulation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

During the experiment, the <b>huff</b> <b>and</b> <b>puff</b> stages, including the injection, the soaking and the production, are carried out for hydrate dissociation.

The initial hydrate saturation before dissociation is 33. 66 % in volume, and the percentage of the hydrate dissociated could be approximately 94 % after 15 <b>huff</b> <b>and</b> <b>puff</b> cycles. The experimental results indicate that with the constant hot water injection rate, the range of the thermal diffusion is restricted around the well, and depressurization rather than thermal stimulation is dominant for gas production. The decline of the cumulative gas produced during each cycle and the diminishing uptrend of the percentage of the hydrate dissociated indicate that the hydrate dissociation rate decreases over time. The gas production efficiency is improved by prolonging the hot water injection time, while this enhancement is limited by the stronger pressurization effect. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
