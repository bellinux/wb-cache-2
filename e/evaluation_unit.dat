5|$|The RN's {{final order}} was for 44 ASW aircraft, {{originally}} designated Merlin HAS.1 but soon changed to Merlin HM1. The first fully operational Merlin was delivered on 17 May 1997, entering service on 2 June 2000. All aircraft were {{delivered by the}} end of 2002, and are operated by four Fleet Air Arm squadrons: 814 NAS, 820 NAS, 824 NAS and 829 NAS, all based at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall. 700 NAS was the Merlin Operational <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Unit</b> from 2000 to 2008. In March 2004, Navy Merlins were temporarily grounded following an incident at RNAS Culdrose in which a tail rotor failed due to a manufacturing defect. An improved tail rotor was designed and adopted on most AW101s; according to AgustaWestland, the redesigned rotor also significantly reduced associated maintenance.|$|E
5|$|The Tornado was {{developed}} and built by Panavia Aircraft GmbH, a tri-national consortium consisting of British Aerospace (previously British Aircraft Corporation), MBB of West Germany, and Aeritalia of Italy. It first flew on 14 August 1974 and was introduced into service in 1979–1980. Due to its multirole design, {{it was able to}} replace several different fleets of aircraft in the adopting air forces. The Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) became the only export operator of the Tornado in addition to the three original partner nations. A tri-nation training and <b>evaluation</b> <b>unit</b> operating from RAF Cottesmore, the Tri-National Tornado Training Establishment, maintained a level of international co-operation beyond the production stage.|$|E
5|$|By late 1961, Hawker {{had been}} able to {{demonstrate}} the validity of its design concept, despite a lack of support from the RAF and little from the Her Majesty's Civil Service. In early 1962, official support emerged {{in the form of the}} Operational Requirements branch of the Ministry of Aviation, which approached the Treasury seeking its sanction of a batch of nine production-standard aircraft to be operated by an <b>evaluation</b> <b>unit</b> to be administered by the Central Fighter Establishment at RAF West Raynham. In light of open interest expressed by figures within the U.S. and West Germany, the British government approached these nations with an offer to collaborate on the project and to seek contributions towards the cost involved. Following the acceptance of all three nations, on 22 May 1962, Hawker received a formal Instruction to Proceed with the procurement of materials for the construction of the nine aircraft.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} trachoma in all suspected endemic districts in Malawi. Methods: A population-based survey conducted in 16 <b>evaluation</b> <b>units</b> from 12 suspected endemic districts in Malawi (population 6, 390, 517), using the standardized Global Trachoma Mapping Project (GTMP) protocol. A 2 -stage cluster-random sampling design selected 30 households from each of 30 clusters per evaluation unit; all residents aged 1 year and older in selected households were examined for evidence of follicular trachoma (TF), intense trachomatous inflammation (TI), and trachomatous trichiasis (TT). Results: Four of the 16 <b>evaluation</b> <b>units</b> {{were found to be}} endemic for trachoma, with a prevalence range of 10. 0 – 13. 5 % for TF and 0. 2 – 0. 6 % for TT. Nine <b>evaluation</b> <b>units</b> had a TF prevalence between 5. 0 % and 9. 9 % while three <b>evaluation</b> <b>units</b> had a TF prevalence 55. 0 %. Conclusion: The prevalence rates of active trachoma in Malawi were not uniform among suspected endemic <b>evaluation</b> <b>units,</b> with rates higher than the World Health Organization (WHO) threshold for implementation of community-based control measures (TF 10. 0 %) in only 4 of the 16 <b>evaluation</b> <b>units.</b> Trachoma remains a disease of public health importance in some parts of Malawi and adjoining (unmapped) districts should be prioritized for mapping.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the main events regarding the making of a national university evaluation system during the Nineties and the main results achieved so far.

Recent national laws assign to the internal <b>evaluation</b> <b>units</b> a difficult task: the external evaluation of their universities, with a clear problem of clashing interests. Therefore, we propose a reform of the national evaluation system in order to assign the task of university self-evaluation to the internal <b>evaluation</b> <b>units,</b> while strengthening the powers of the National University Evaluation Council that should perform a true external evaluation of universities...|$|R

500|$|The {{division}} was first activated in December 1917 in World War I, and based at Fort Ord, California {{for most of}} its history. Although elements of the division saw brief active service in World War I, it is best known for its participation in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II where it took heavy casualties engaging the Imperial Japanese Army in the Aleutian Islands, Leyte, and Okinawa. Following the Japanese surrender in 1945, the {{division was}} stationed in Japan and South Korea, and with the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 {{was one of the first}} units in action. It took part in the Inchon Landings and the advance north until Chinese forces counter-attacked and almost overwhelmed the scattered division. The 7th later would fight in the Battle of Pork Chop Hill and the Battle of Old Baldy. From 1953 to 1971, the 7th Infantry Division defended the Korean Demilitarized Zone. Its main garrison was Camp Casey, South Korea. During these occupation duties, the division saw a complete reorganization in compliance with the Reorganization Objective Army Divisions plan. The division's former headquarters company grew into the 1st Brigade, 7th Infantry Division while the 13th Infantry Brigade was reactivated as the 2nd Brigade, 7th Infantry Division. The 14th Infantry Brigade was reactivated as the 3rd Brigade, 7th Infantry Division. In 1965 the division received its distinctive unit insignia, which alluded to its history during the Korean War. On 2 April 1971, the division returned to the United States and was inactivated at Fort Lewis, Washington. In October 1974 the 7th reactivated at its former garrison, Fort Ord. [...] In the late 1980s, it briefly saw action overseas in Operation Golden Pheasant in Honduras and Operation Just Cause in Panama. In the early 1990s, it provided domestic support to the civil authorities in Operation Green Sweep and during the 1992 Los Angeles Riots. In 1994, the division was inactivated at Ft. Ord and Ft Ord was closed, as per BRAC rulings. Reactivated in 1999 at Ft Carson, Colorado, where the division's final role was as a training and <b>evaluation</b> <b>unit</b> for Army National Guard brigades, which it undertook until its inactivation in 2006.|$|E

A major criticism of this study was that each of the participating hospitals was only asked to submit datasets from 30 patients: arguably, the study was heavily biased by the ability to [...] "cherry-pick" [...] the most favourable datasets, and the lack of availability of all data for independent scrutiny and objective assessment.|$|E

40|$|A moving region whose {{location}} and extend {{change over time}} can imply topological changes such as region split and hole formation. To study this phenomenon is useful in many applications, e. g. the topology control of wireless sensor networks and emergency handling. It is challenging to detect the topological changes of a moving region since we lack the ability to capture its continuous change of shapes all the time. Moreover, for a complex moving region containing multiple components, {{it is hard to}} determine which component before the change corresponds to which component after the change. In this paper, we propose a model to determine topological changes of a complex moving region through snapshots called observations. We introduce a twophase strategy that the first phase partitions the observations into several <b>evaluation</b> <b>units</b> and uniquely maps a unit before the change to exactly one unit after the change; the second phase interprets the topological change by integrating all basic topological changes from <b>evaluation</b> <b>units...</b>|$|R
