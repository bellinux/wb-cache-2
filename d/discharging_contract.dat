40|$|The {{topic of}} {{discharge}} by {{breach of contract}} constitutes one of the thorniest areas of the common law of contract. This paper is a wide-ranging one and adopts a comparative approach. It first explores {{the nature of a}} breach of contract (as contrasted, for example, to <b>discharge</b> of a <b>contract</b> by frustration) before proceeding to consider the relevant historical origins which might provide some clues as to why we now have different approaches in ascertaining whether or not the innocent party can elect to treat itself as <b>discharged</b> from a <b>contract</b> {{as a result of a}} breach by the other party of one or more of the terms of that contract (focusing on the “condition-warranty approach” and “Hongkong Fir approach”). The paper then proceeds to analyse the aforementioned approaches on doctrinal, theoretical as well as practical levels. Finally, it explores more specific aspects of the topic (including the legal effect of a breach of contract committed by both parties; whether termination of a contract of employment is “elective” or “automatic” (focusing on the UK Supreme Court decision of Geys v Société Générale, London Branch); as well as the breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence) ...|$|R

Two anophthalmic cases that underwent enucleation and multiple orbital surgeries to enhance the anophthalmic socket volume developed pain, intense <b>discharge</b> and <b>contracted</b> cavities with chronic inflammation in the socket which was nonresponsive to medical therapy. Computed tomography indicated a hypodense foreign body in both cases causing an intense inflammatory reaction. The implants were removed by excisional surgery and a room temperature vulcanized silicone implant was retrieved in both cases. Socket inflammation resolved in both cases after implant removal. An intraorbital inflammatory reaction against an intraorbital implant can cause chronic socket inflammation in patients {{with a history of}} multiple surgeries.

5000|$|Accord and {{satisfaction}} is a contract law concept about {{the purchase of}} the release from a debt obligation. It is one of the methods by which parties to a contract may terminate their agreement. The release is completed by the transfer of valuable consideration that must not be the actual performance of the obligation itself. The accord is the agreement to discharge the obligation and the satisfaction is the legal [...] "consideration" [...] which binds the parties to the agreement. A valid accord does not discharge the prior contract; instead it suspends the right to enforce it in accordance with the terms of the accord contract, in which satisfaction, or performance of the <b>contract</b> will <b>discharge</b> both <b>contracts</b> (the original and the accord). If the creditor breaches the accord, then the debtor will be able to bring up the existence of the accord in order to enjoin any action against him.|$|R

40|$|S u m m a r y The goal of {{this thesis}} is to analyse the legal {{consequences}} of the breach of contract, especially under civil law, although, some essential comparison with legal regulation of commercial law is given, too. The text is divided into ten chapters. In the introduction, i. e. {{in the first two}} chapters the term of contract is defined and then the basic legal principles of the contractual law are enumerated and described in respect of the topic. The third chapter deals with the subject of the paper globally and shortly characterises each consequence of the breach of contract. The account of them is also given. The following chapters provide complete information how every consequence works and which part it plays in the Czech legal system. Specifically, Chapter Four is focused on debtor's delay and Chapter Five on creditor's delay. Chapter Six investigates liability for damage and damages a bit, as well. Chapter Seven deals with liability for defects and Chapter Eight is about contractual fine. In Chapter Nine is mentioned <b>discharge</b> of <b>contract</b> and its consequences.

In the last chapter, i. e. in the Conclusion is the whole topic shortly summarized with [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} industry has {{in recent years}} witnessed a paradigm shift towards the use of more collaborative contracting relationships and integrated processes {{in an attempt to}} improve construction project delivery. Trust is central to the success of these contracting approaches and although efforts are usually aimed at improving trust relations in client-contractor relationships, there has so far been mixed findings on how trust is influenced by formal control mechanisms <b>discharged</b> via formal <b>contracts.</b> In construction contracting, there is therefore the need to investigate how different governance modes and control mechanisms deployed on construction projects are perceived by those being controlled and how this in turn influences trust. Through a critique of the extant literature on trust and control in construction, this study reveals that the trust-control relationship which can be both complimentary and supplementary has far reaching implications on the measurement/assessment of trust in the construction project context. The orientation of governance and control mechanisms selected by clients and the behavioural consequences of these from contractors can thus be used as a measure of the degree of trust that exists in the dyad...|$|R
40|$|Quasi-stable glow {{discharge}} phase {{is known to}} be characteristic for the pulse breakdown of gases by the uniform initiation of initial electrons. The papers [1 - 3] show that the contraction of the {{glow discharge}} can be schematized as follows. At first the cathode spot is formed on account of the cathode instability and of the explosive emission. Then the current density increases in the discharge column against the cathode spot and one can observe a diffuse channel bound to the spot against a background of the glow <b>discharge.</b> The high-conductive <b>contracted</b> spark channe 1 germinates along the diffuse channel on the cathode and the anode sides at the third stage. The investigations carried out in noble gases (Ar, Kr, Xe) and in noble gases with small additions of haloid-contained compounds (SF 6, CCl 4) showed a great number of the cathode spots and diffuse channels to be ignited in the interelectrode volume [4, 5]. These channels form a column of a homogenous plasma when mixing. The discharge involved was called as a high-current diffuse discharge (H-C. D. D.).

40|$|V 6 O 13 is a {{promising}} Li-ion battery cathode material {{for use in}} the high temperature oil field environment. The material exhibits a high capacity, and the voltage profile contains several plateaus associated with a series of complex structural transformations, which are not fully understood. The underlying mechanisms are central to understanding and improving the performance of V 6 O 13 -based rechargeable batteries. In this study, we present in situ X-ray diffraction data that highlight an asymmetric six-step discharge and five step charge process, due to a phase that is only formed on discharge. The LixV 6 O 13 unit cell expands sequentially in c, b, and a directions during <b>discharge</b> and reversibly <b>contracts</b> back during charge. The process is associated with change of Li ion positions as well as charge ordering in LixV 6 O 13. Density functional theory calculations give further insight into the electronic structures and preferred Li positions in the different structures formed upon cycling, particularly at high lithium contents, where no prior structural data are available. The results shed light into the high specific capacity of V 6 O 13 and are likely to aid in the development of this material for use as a cathode for secondary lithium batteries...|$|R
40|$|Electronegative RF {{discharges}} are extensively {{used in the}} semi-conductor {{industry for}} material processing. Despite this the subject of electronegative RF discharges has been largely neglected. The aim of this thesis is to investigate a RF oxygen discharge by mass/energy spectrometry, a retarding field analyser and an actively compensated Langmuir probe. Measurements are also obtained in argon for comparison. In this thesis pure oxygen {{will be used as}} this has relatively simple discharge chemistry with most of the rate constants well known. Ion energy analysis (Chapter 3) show the <b>discharge</b> to <b>contract</b> into the centre of the chamber at low pressures in both gases. The expected thinner peak of the oxygen ion energy distribution was not observed, this is shown to be due to RF modulation of the positive ions with collisions playing a role. The dominant positive ion in the discharge bulk and colliding in the sheath in oxygen was found to be O_ 2 "+ with less than 10 % O"+ over the range of pressure investigated (Chapter 4). Various minor ions such as O_ 3 "+ and O_ 4 "+ were also observed. By actively compensating a Langmuir probe for the first three plasma harmonics it is shown that it is unnecessary to compensate when the amplitude of a given harmonic is comparable to the electron temperature (Chapter 5). A study of Langmuir probe measurements in argon (Chapter 7) has shown that the use of the collisionless Alien, Boyd and Reynolds theory leads to discrepancies in the measured electron densities. The correct density can be obtained by using the perturbation method of Shih and Levi, this corrects for ion-neutral collisions in electropositive plasmas only. This theory is extended to electronegative plasmas (Chapter 6) so that measurements of the negative ion density obtained from the collisionless theory of Arnemiya, Annaratone and Alien can be corrected. Langmuir probe measurements in oxygen indicate a peak in the negative ion density at around 3 Pa and are found to be in good agreement with independent measurements (Chapter 8).

That none or only a very contemptible part, {{of the value of}} this produce could be remitted to France, the author will see, perhaps with unwillingness, but with the clearest conviction, if he considers, that in the year 1763, after we had ceased to export to the isles of Guadaloupe and Martinico, and to the Havannah, and after the colonies were free to send all their produce to Old France and Spain, if they had any remittance to make; he will see, that we imported from those places, in that year, to the amount of 1,395,300l. So far was the whole annual produce of these islands from being adequate to the payments of their annual call upon us, that this mighty additional importation was necessary, though not quite sufficient, to <b>discharge</b> the debts <b>contracted</b> in the few years we held them.

40|$|The {{constriction}} of {{the positive}} column of a glow discharge in argon was studied both experimentally and theoretically. In experiments the direct current discharge was maintained in a cylindrical glass tube of 3 cm internal diameter and 75 cm length. The voltage–current U(I) characteristics of the discharge were measured at a gas pressure P from 1 to 120 Torr {{in a wide range}} of discharge currents. At P 2 ̆ 6 gt; 20 Torr the measured U(I) characteristics display the classical hysteresis effect: the transition from the diffuse to the <b>contracted</b> <b>discharge</b> form (with increasing current) occurs at a current higher than that for reverse transition (with decreasing current). It was also found that in some cases the so-called partially contracted form of the discharge is realized, when the diffuse and contracted forms coexist in the discharge tube. To calculate the plasma parameters under experimental conditions a 1 D axial-symmetric discharge model for pure argon was developed. The details of the model are described and the results of simulations are presented. In particular, the electric field strength E in the positive column was calculated as a function of the discharge current. Theoretical E(I) characteristics are compared with those derived from the experiment. For the first time, the detailed kinetic model without the usage of fit parameters predicts the hysteresis effect in pure Ar with parameters of diffuse and constricted forms of the discharge in good agreement with the experiment...|$|R
