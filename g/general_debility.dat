500|$|According to Princeton {{historian}} J.E. Seigel, in {{his late}} teens Marx may have had pneumonia or pleurisy, the effects of which led to his being exempted from Prussian military service. In later life whilst working on Capital (which he never completed), Marx suffered from a trio of afflictions. A liver ailment, probably hereditary, was aggravated by overwork, bad diet and lack of sleep. Inflammation of the eyes was induced by too much work at night. A third affliction, eruption of carbuncles or boils, [...] "was probably brought on by <b>general</b> physical <b>debility</b> to which the various features of Marx's style of life — alcohol, tobacco, poor diet, and failure to sleep — all contributed. Engels often exhorted Marx to alter this dangerous regime". In Professor Siegel's thesis, what lay behind this punishing sacrifice of his health may have been guilt about self-involvement and egoism, originally induced in Karl Marx by his father.|$|R
50|$|In 1916, as art-student Roi Livingstone de Mestre, {{he joined}} the First Australian Imperial Force. He was {{accepted}} three times after initially being rejected because his chest measurement was allegedly undersized. It appears to be indicative of the great desire {{of the armed forces}} to procure men for the World War I war effort that they would have considered accepting De Maistre once, let alone three times in short succession - and indicative of his great desire to serve in the war effort that he continually rejoined even after he had found himself too weak to cope with the workload. In May 1916 he was accepted for the first time but discharged a month later in June as medically unfit. He joined again one month later in July, but unable to cope physically at his own request he was discharged two months later in September. He joined yet once more one month later in October and was sent to the Field Hospital at Liverpool to train as a medical orderly. Then three months later in January 1917 he again requested a discharge as he felt that the work was beyond him. Due to his <b>general</b> weakness and <b>debility</b> his request for discharge was easily accepted. His <b>general</b> weakness and <b>debility</b> was due to tuberculosis that {{he had been able to}} keep hidden from the army doctors, one of whom even described his illness as congenital. Each time he joined up his illness had beaten him, and he had been unable to continue. Tuberculosis was the reason why he had earlier given up any idea of pursuing a music career, and had turned solely to painting.|$|R

But the time of bitter grief, which had been appointed, though they knew it not, came inexorably, even {{while they were still}} lightly jesting at all medical authority round the painter's fireside. Lavinia caught a severe cold.

6000|$|If any one doubts the {{importance}} of an acquaintance {{with the principles of}} physiology, as a means to complete living, let him look around and see how many men and women he can find in middle or later life who are thoroughly well. Only occasionally do we meet with an example of vigorous health continued to old age; hourly do we meet with examples of acute disorder, chronic ailment, <b>general</b> <b>debility,</b> premature decrepitude. Scarcely is there one to whom you put the question, who has not, {{in the course of his}} life, brought upon himself illnesses which a little information would have saved him from. Here is a case of heart-disease consequent on a rheumatic fever that followed reckless exposure. There is a case of eyes spoiled for life by over-study. Yesterday the account was of one whose long-enduring lameness was brought on by continuing, spite of the pain, to use a knee after it had been slightly injured. And to-day we are told of another who has had to lie by for years, because he did not know that the palpitation he suffered under resulted from overtaxed brain. Now we hear of an irremediable injury which followed some silly feat of strength; and, again, of a constitution that has never recovered from the effects of excessive work needlessly undertaken. While on every side we see the perpetual minor ailments which accompany feebleness. Not to dwell on the pain, the weariness, the gloom, the waste of time and money thus entailed, only consider how greatly ill-health hinders the discharge of all duties--makes business often impossible, and always more difficult; produces an irritability fatal to the right management of children; puts the functions of citizenship out of the question; and makes amusement a bore. Is it not clear that the physical sins--partly our forefathers' and partly our own--which produce this ill-health, deduct more from complete living than anything else? and to a great extent make life a failure and a burden instead of a benefaction and a pleasure? ...|$|E
60|$|Then there arose {{a debate}} upon the whole {{principle}} of the measure, which was carried on with great warmth. I, as President, of course took no part in it; but, in accordance with our constitution, I heard it all from the chair which I usually occupied at the Speaker's right hand. The arguments on which the greatest stress was laid tended {{to show that the}} Fixed Period had been carried chiefly with a view to relieving the miseries of the old. And it was conclusively shown that, in a very great majority of cases, life beyond sixty-eight was all vanity and vexation of spirit. That other argument as to the costliness of old men to the state was for the present dropped. Had you listened to young Grundle, insisting with all the vehemence of youth on the absolute wretchedness to which the aged had been condemned by the absence of any such law,--had you heard the miseries of rheumatism, gout, stone, and <b>general</b> <b>debility</b> pictured in the eloquent words of five-and-twenty,--you would have felt that all who could lend themselves to perpetuate such a state of things must be guilty of fiendish cruelty. He really rose to a great height of parliamentary excellence, and altogether carried with him the younger, and luckily the greater, part of the House. There was really nothing to be said on the other side, except a repetition of the prejudices of the Old World. But, alas! so strong are the weaknesses of the world, that prejudice can always vanquish truth by the mere strength of its battalions. Not till it had been proved and re-proved ten times over, was it understood that the sun could not have stood still upon Gideon. Crasweller, who was a member, and who took his seat during these debates without venturing to speak, merely whispered to his neighbour that the heartless greedy fellow was unwilling to wait for the wools of Little Christchurch.|$|E

5000|$|Acedia is {{indicated}} by a range of signs. These signs (or symptoms) are typically divided into two basic categories: somatic and psychological. Acedia frequently presents signs somatically. Such bodily symptoms range from mere sleepiness to <b>general</b> sickness or <b>debility,</b> along {{with a host of}} more specific symptoms: weakness in the knees, pain in the limbs, and fever. An anecdote attributed to the Desert Mother Amma Theodora also connects somatic pain and illness with the onset of acedia. A host of psychological symptoms can also signify the presence of acedia, which affects the mental state and behavior of the afflicted. Some commonly reported psychological signs revolve around a lack of attention to daily tasks and an overall dissatisfaction with life. The best-known of the psychological signs of acedia is tedium, boredom or general laziness. Author Kathleen Norris in her book Acedia and Me asserts that dictionary definitions such as torpor and sloth fail to do justice to this [...] "temptation"; she believes a state of restlessness, of not living in the present and seeing the future as overwhelming is more accurate a definition than straight laziness: it is especially present in monasteries, due to the cutting off of distractions, but can invade any vocation where the labor is long, the rewards slow to appear, such as scientific research, long term marriages etc. Another sign is a lack of caring, of being unfeeling about things, whether that be your appearance, hygiene, your relationships, your community's welfare, the world's welfare etc.; all of this, Norris relates, is connected to the hopelessness and vague unease that arises from having too many choices, lacking true commitment, of being [...] "a slave from within". She relates this to forgetfulness about [...] "the one thing needful": remembrance of God. Anthony Robbins, the well known life coach, also believes a lack of commitment to spiritual growth will lead to negative states of mind.|$|R

40|$|Background : Children {{suffering}} from beta-thalassemia major require repeated blood transfusions {{which may be}} associated with dangers like iron overload and contraction of infections such as HIV, HCV, and HBsAg which ultimately curtail their life span. On the other hand, inadequate transfusions lead to severe anemia and <b>general</b> fatigue and <b>debility.</b> Materials and Methods: Data were obtained from 142 beta-thalassemia major patients aged 3 years or more receiving regular blood transfusions at a transfusion centre in Western India from 1 April 2009 to 30 June 2009. The clinical data and laboratory results were subsequently analyzed. Results: Of the 142 patients, 76 (53. 5 &#x 0025;) were undertransfused (mean Hb < 10 gm&#x 0025;). 96 (67 &#x 0025;) of the patients were taking some form of chelation therapy but out of them only 2 (2 &#x 0025;) were adequately chelated (S. ferritin < 1000 ng/ml). 5 (3. 5 &#x 0025;) of the patients were known diabetics on insulin therapy. 103 (72 &#x 0025;) of the patients were retarded in terms of growth. The prevalence of transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs) such as HCV, HIV, and HBsAg was respectively 45 &#x 0025;, 2 &#x 0025;, and 2 &#x 0025;, with the prevalence of HCV being significantly more than the general population. The HCV prevalence showed positive correlation with the age of the patients and with the total no of blood transfusions received. As many as 15 &#x 0025; (6 out of 40) children who were born on or after 2002 were HCV positive despite the blood they received being subjected to screening for HCV. Conclusions: The study suggests the need to step up the transfusions to achieve hemoglobin goal of 10 gm&#x 0025; (as per the moderate transfusion regimen) and also to institute urgent and effective chelation measures with the aim of keeping serum ferritin levels below 1000 ng/ml to avoid the systemic effects of iron overload. In addition, strict monitoring of the children for endocrinopathy and other systemic effects of iron overload should be done. Rigid implementation of quality control measures for the ELISA kits used to detect HCV in donor blood needs to be done urgently. Alternately, more sensitive and specific measures (like NAT testing) should be employed for detection of HCV. In the absence of a definitive cure accessible and available to all patients, strict implementation of the above suggested measures {{will go a long way}} in improving the quality (and quantity) of life in patients of beta-thalassemia major...|$|R

5000|$|Private Miguel Guerrero {{was born}} in Minorca ca. 1805. From there he moved to New Orleans. In 1848 he moved to Palmetto, Florida. He was a fisherman.

[...] After his discharge, he {{returned}} to Terra Ceia and commercial fishing. Shortly after his discharge from state service, he met and then married Fredrica Kramer who was from Bavaria. Her aunt, Julia Atzeroth, owned a store in Palmetto. Family lore has it that he didnt speak German and she didnt speak Spanish, and neither spoke English. Miguel and Frederica moved from his modest fisherman shack shed to a small home on the long shell mound facing what is now [...] "Miguel Bay" [...] Their family grew at a rapid pace. Michael {{was born in}} 1857, and Frederick in 1859. [...] He was mustered into Confederate service on April 25, 1862, when he was enlisted as a private in Captain Smiths Company (Key West Avengers), 7th Regiment Florida Infantry by Major R. B. Thomas at Tampa, Florida, for a period of 3 years or the war. He was present on all rolls until November 8, 1862, when he was reported as absent sick in hospital at Knoxville, Tennessee. On March 1, 1863, he was reported as being discharged under Surgeons Certificate due to diagnosis of chronic rheumatism and <b>general</b> <b>debility</b> the result of age. On this certificate, he is described as being 58 years of age, 5 feet 6 inches tall, dark complexion, gray eyes, light hair, and by occupation a fisherman when enlisted. He was discharged from service on March 9, 1863, while his company was stationed at Watauga Bridge, Tennessee. Returning to Terra Ceia, Manuel resumed his livelihood of fishing. Frederica bore three more children; Christopher on June 1, 1864, Robert in 1866, and Mary in 1868. Shortly following Marys birth, yellow fever struck the family, killing Michael and Fredrick. Miguel and Frederica buried their small bodies in the shell mound. Following the solemn service, Miguel had to leave on an extended fishing trip. When he returned, he found his wife dead; she was lying in bed next to her new baby. Miguel was not well himself. He too had been stricken with the fever. The two young boys were running around outside disoriented and hungry. They were confused; they didnt understand why their mother wasnt responding to them or where the two oldest children had gone. Miguel couldnt communicate with them. The extended fishing trip had left him weak. He was too faint to bury Frederica, or take a rowboat to the mainland and get help. He laid down next to his beloved wife, waiting to join her in the afterlife. Asa Bishop, of Bishops Point in Palma Sola, eventually came sailing by. He was in a neighborly mood when he stopped in to discover the dire situation. He helped Miguel bury Frederica in the shell mound. According to an interview conducted by the Manatee County Historic Society, his son claimed he eventually caught the two boys in a castnet. He then loaded Miguel and the three children in his boat and carried them to his home. Miguel and the baby eventually died. Reverend Edmund Lee and his wife Electa of the Village of Manatee adopted Christopher, changing his name to Edmund Miguel Guerro Lee, or E.M. Lee as he was called.

Aim: The {{present study was}} carried out to analyze mortality pattern in Murrah buffalo males in National Dairy Research Institute herd. Materials and Methods: Records of 1029 Murrah buffalo males born during the period 1997 - 2012, at NDRI, Karnal, were analyzed to study mortality pattern in different age groups. The percent of animal disposed from the herd due to different reasons was calculated by proportion using descriptive statistics. Results: The overall percent mortality in 0 - 1 m, 1 - 2 m, 2 - 3 m, 3 - 6 m, 6 - 18 m, 18 m- 3 yr and> 3 year age groups were 17. 49, 5. 99, 3. 34, 5. 42, 6. 35, 2. 59 and 3. 93, respectively. The main cause of mortality in 0 - 1, 1 - 2, 2 - 3 and 6 - 18 m of age groups was respiratory problems (6. 61 %, 1. 79 %, 1. 06 % and 1. 97 % respectively). Main causes of mortality in age group 3 - 6 months were <b>general</b> <b>debility</b> (1. 57 %) followed by respiratory and digestive problems (1. 22 %), miscellaneous (0. 87 %), liver and urinary problems (0. 17 %). Mortality could not reveal any consistent trend across different seasons and period of birth. <b>General</b> <b>debility</b> (1. 29 %) followed by toxemia, liver problems and miscellaneous reasons were main causes of mortality in age group 18 m – 3 yr of age. In males above three years of age, <b>general</b> <b>debility</b> (2. 81 %) followed by respiratory problems (1. 12 %) were the main causes of mortality...|$|E
