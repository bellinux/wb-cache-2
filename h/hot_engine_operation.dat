40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{detailed}} analysis focused on lumped parameters numerical modeling of high speed direct injected internal combustion engine cooling systems is presented and discussed. More in details, the cooling systems here studied are characterized by extreme performance, {{both in terms of}} circulating flow rates and thermal loads. First of all, a comprehensive description of the simulation environment properly tailored for cooling systems modeling is introduced and all its geometric, fluid-dynamic and thermodynamic characteristics are described in depth. Then, the model has been validated through an exhaustive numerical vs. experimental comparison, involving both cold and <b>hot</b> <b>engine</b> <b>operation,</b> {{for a wide range of}} rotational speeds. The general good accordance obtained between calculated and measured results clearly demonstrate the reliability of the numerical model. Finally, the main capabilities of the lumped parameters model as a useful design tool have been evidently showed by investigating different cooling circuit configurations and comparing the results here obtained with the baseline solution...|$|E

Coating systems consisting of a plasma-sprayed layer of zirconia stabilized with either yttria, magnesia or calcia over a thin alloy bond coat have been developed, their potential analyzed and their durability and benefits evaluated in a turbojet engine. The coatings on air-cooled rotating blades were in good condition after completing as many as 500 two-minute cycles of <b>engine</b> <b>operation</b> between full power at a gas temperature of 1644 K and flameout, or as much as 150 hours of steady-state operation on cooled vanes and blades at gas temperatures as high as 1644 K witn 35 start and stop cycles. On the basis of durability and processing cost, the yttria-stabilized zirconia was considered the best of the three coatings investigated...|$|R

5000|$|The {{development}} of small-capacity, high-speed diesel engines in the 1930s and 1940s, led to <b>hot</b> bulb <b>engines</b> falling dramatically out of favour. The last large-scale manufacturer of <b>hot</b> bulb <b>engines</b> stopped producing {{them in the}} 1950s and they are now virtually extinct in commercial use, except in very remote areas of the developing world. An exception to this is marine use; <b>hot</b> bulb <b>engines</b> were widely fitted to inland barges and narrowboats in Europe. The United Kingdom's first two self-powered [...] "motor" [...] narrowboats—Cadbury's Bournville I and Bournville II in 1911—were powered by 15 horsepower Bolinder single-cylinder <b>hot</b> bulb <b>engines,</b> and this type became common between the 1920s and the 1950s.

Fabrication of the 2070 F-configuration ceramic parts continued, along with burner rig development testing of the 2070 F-configuration metal combustor in preparation for 1132 C (2070 F) qualification test conditions.

Cold spin testing of the critical 2070 F-configuration blade continued in the spin test rig to qualify a set of ceramic blades at 117 % engine speed for the gasifier turbine rotor.

5000|$|The <b>hot</b> tube <b>engine</b> [...] is a {{relative}} of the <b>hot</b> bulb <b>engine</b> with better timing control. The <b>hot</b> bulb <b>engine</b> only ran well at one speed- and a low one at that, typically 100 RPM. The timing of a <b>hot</b> tube <b>engine</b> is controlled by means of varying {{the length of the}} Hot-tube ignitor, which is longer and thinner than the hot bulb on a <b>hot</b> bulb <b>engine.</b> Length of the tube controls when the charge ignites, and allows different operating speeds to be selected. If made variable, this makes for adjustable engine speed, but also induces a mechanical weakness in the engine which tends to lead to failure. Both engine types are now replaced by diesels, which can be made to operate over varying loads and speeds in any size with modern methods. Hot bulbs are still used in remote areas where the extreme fuel flexibility is a major advantage. <b>Hot</b> tube <b>engines</b> may also be found there, if their difficulties with the adjustable tube can be overcome, or accepted and lived with.|$|R

Parametric functions of engine work were determined on the basis of algebraic analysis scheme designed by S. Drobot. This scheme makes possible to control the correctness of conclusion rules regarding mathematics in digital functions describing operation of ship propulsion engine. Additionally the parametric form of function makes possible to investigate the influence of function parameters on correctness of <b>engine</b> <b>operation.</b> It makes possible to forecast the <b>engine</b> <b>operation</b> i given sailing conditions and to estimate steerability of ship during the voyage.
