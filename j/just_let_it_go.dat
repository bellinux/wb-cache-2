500|$|In 2017, Holt {{talked about}} {{recording}} the guitar solos, [...] "That's {{one of my}} favorites on the album. I'm never blown away by anything I've done musically. I always want to redo it five minutes after I'm done with it. That goes down to songwriting too - it's never going to be perfect. Nothing's perfect. So yeah, I went in and did all the solos for that album in a day. I just sat down with a six pack of beer with Kerry and Terry Date. They just let me do my own thing. Tom came in after I had been messing around with a solo for a half an hour and he told me the first take was perfect. I told him they've got to let me know because I'll keep going over it and sometimes you lose a good thing when that happens. You've got to know when to <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> and keep it whether it's raw or rough or perfect or maybe there a little bit of magic in there." ...|$|E

So we had to start to soften {{it up a little bit}} and break the ice somewhat [...] I’m glad he gave us that heads up." [...] Lead actress Kristen Bell expressed surprise over the initial decision by saying, [...] "I love working with Jason and he's such a great actor to work opposite, but sometimes, I feel it's really just weird luck. Somehow people get magic dust sprinkled on them and you don't know why. You look like you have boatloads of chemistry with someone else." [...] On the kiss itself, Dohring noted, [...] "It was so funny, as an actor, to kiss this girl. I was all nervous beforehand. But you have to <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> for the scene. It was so fun to watch ," [...] adding that [...] "a lot of that emotion was real for me."

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Party" [...] {{features}} Beyoncé as {{the female}} protagonist [...] "in {{the mood for}} some loving" [...] as she references to a get-together for two persons. West rhymes about [...] "swag sauce" [...] and [...] "swagu" [...] in the introductory lines, [...] "You a bad girl, your friends bad too / You got the swag sauce, you're drippin' Swagu", before passing the torch to Beyoncé, who begins to sing the first verse slowly and steadily, [...] "I may be young but I'm ready / To give you all my love / I told my girls {{you can get it}} / Don't slow it down, <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> / So in love / I'll give it all away / Just don't tell nobody tomorrow". In the chorus lines, she harmonizes over the sample from [...] "La Di Da Di", [...] "Cause tonight's the night that I give you everything / Music knocking until the morning light / 'Cause we like to party". In the second verse, Beyoncé belts out [...] "in a thick stack of smooth, layered vocals". After chanting the chorus for a second time, André 3000 surfaces around the 2:15 mark with [...] "some very naughty references" [...] to milk on the verses he raps, [...] "... another homeboy, that nigga named Cheese / Fuck wit' me baby, I make it milk 'til it drip down yo' knees", before switching gears altogether and getting philosophical about his own career, [...] "Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old / Never thought that we could become someone else's hero / Man, we were just in the food court eating our gyros", and finally adopting a [...] "multi-syllabic tongue twister" [...] to rap some of the finishing lines. The song runs out with Beyoncé reiterating the lines, [...] "Cause we like to party, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey", and West then [...] reprises the opening lines.|$|E

5000|$|The band got {{together}} at Saturation Acres for this cause {{that they believed}} in and recorded four songs for an EP {{to be released in}} conjunction with the live event. At first, they were unsure if some of their recent differences would be an impediment to this goal, but within fifteen minutes of playing, they all felt at home with each other. As vocalist Pete Palladino put it at the time; [...] "I think everybody at that point had <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> all <b>go.</b> All of those hang-ups and baggage that we carried around from all of those years were let go, and we just accepted each other -.and it was a great feeling." ...|$|R

It was released after its premiere to streaming services and digital download. In {{an interview with}} Matt Wilkinson of Beats 1, the band described the song as [...] "the most synth-heavy tune" [...] they've made. Lead vocalist Ellie Rowsell also said: [...] "I kind of wanted to make one of those {{head out the window}} on a long drive tunes. And I wanted to try my hand at like a hold-nothing-back love song. That was my thoughts. But other than that I <b>just</b> kinda <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> where <b>it</b> wanted to go… I just think if you hold back it will sound worse won't it?". Regarding the sound of the album, they added: [...] "I think hopefully when people hear the whole thing it won't be so all over the place. There are things that tie the 'Yuk Foos' and 'Don't Delete The Kisses' together if you know what I mean. There's hopefully something for everyone. I too struggle to define it" ...|$|R

Because of Dion's unwillingness to leave her seven-month-old baby, the album's collaborators traveled to Montreal. [...] "I didn't feel the pressure to try and outdo anything," [...] Dion said of her time in the studio. [...] "I proved myself before, so now I can enjoy. I was relaxed, I <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>go.</b> <b>It</b> was such a pleasure." [...] The album was scheduled for release internationally on 25 March 2002 and in North America on 26 March 2002.

5000|$|Cale {{described}} his mood while making Music for a New Society as [...] "grotesque." [...] In {{an interview with}} Melody Maker shortly after the album's release, Cale {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "That album was agony. It was like method acting. Madness. Excruciating. I <b>just</b> <b>let</b> myself <b>go.</b> <b>It</b> became a kind of therapy, a personal exorcism. The songs are mostly about regret and misplaced faith." [...] In What's Welsh for Zen?, Cale further commented that [...] "There were some examples where songs ended up so emaciated they weren't songs any more. What I was most interested in was the terror of the moment... It was a bleak record all right, but it wasn't made to make people jump out of windows." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{interviews}} in October 2004 and February 2006, Schilling said about Gomez:There {{are a lot}} of people in that industry, Pedro Gomez, Joel Heyman, to name a few. People with so little skill in their profession that they need to speculate, make up, fabricate, to write something interesting enough to be printed. What makes them bad people? I am sure I cannot nail the exact reason, but I know some. Jealousy, bitterness, the need to be 'different,' I am sure there are others, but those are the ones I know off hand ... You just kind of have to realize that there are people that don't like you and, unfortunately, sometimes those people have a voice, disliking me probably matches my dislike for him (Gomez), but I have a problem with people who don't have integrity and principle, so that stuff happens. You just kind of <b>just</b> have to <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go.</b>|$|R
6000|$|I {{set down}} one time {{back in the}} woods, and had a long think about it. I says to myself, if a body can get {{anything}} they pray for, why don't Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork? Why can't the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole? Why can't Miss Watson fat up? No, says I to my self, there ain't nothing in it. I went and told the widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was [...] "spiritual gifts." [...] This was too many for me, but she told me what she meant--I must help other people, and do everything I could for other people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about myself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took it. I {{went out in the}} woods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn't see no advantage about it--except for the other people; so at last I reckoned I wouldn't worry about it any more, but <b>just</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>go.</b> Sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about Providence in {{a way to make a}} body's mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold and knock it all down again. I judged I could see that there was two Providences, and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widow's Providence, but if Miss Watson's got him there warn't no help for him any more. I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong to the widow's if he wanted me, though I couldn't make out how he was a-going to be any better off then than what he was before, seeing I was so ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery.|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{opening scene}} of the Revel was rather effective," [...] {{continued}} Cornelian; [...] "all the Shadow people reclined in the dimly-lit centre of the ballroom in an indistinguishable mass, and the human characters marched round the illuminated sides {{of the room to}} solemn processional music. Every now and then a shadow would detach itself from the mass, hail its partner by name, and glide out to join him or her in the procession. Then, when the last shadows had found their mates and every one was partnered, the lights were turned up in a blaze, the orchestra crashed out a whirl of nondescript dance music, and people <b>just</b> <b>let</b> themselves <b>go.</b> <b>It</b> was Pandemonium. Afterwards every one strutted about for half an hour or so, showing themselves off, and then the legitimate programme of dances began. There were some rather amusing incidents throughout the evening. One set of lancers was danced entirely by the Seven Deadly Sins and their human exemplars; of course seven couples were not sufficient to make up the set, so they had to bring in an eighth sin, I forget what it was." ...|$|R
5000|$|I felt very, {{very upset}} with the way people treated each other last year, when we were writing, {{and a lot of}} that came out as anger. It made me feel a lot better to sing about it, and a lot of what was said really needed to be said by someone, even if I didn't. Even if my main message that people get is 'I don't know what's going on but I think you're all dicks... does anyone else feel like this?', that's {{important}} as no one was saying even that. Everyone was <b>just</b> <b>letting</b> <b>it</b> all <b>go</b> on, only saying 'ooh, isn't it terrible?', but not engaging or trying to understand why these things were happening, or not even having an opinion about our role in all of it. I just felt like I needed to say something, even if that is on a poppy-indie type record. Perhaps that's not the best way to do it, but I have that platform, so it's the one I used. Jonathan Higgs on the album's lyrics, in an interview with The Line of Best Fit The album's themes revolve around the current affairs of 2015, such as the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and the British media's handling of the United Kingdom general election, as well as on the state of humanity. Lead writer Higgs spent a year writing the album, time he spent [...] "watching rolling news" [...] and enveloping himself in current events. Pritchard told the London Evening Standard that [...] "we're in an age where we're more conscious of and violence, you've got rolling news and you're constantly bombarded by information". Speaking to Chris Parkin of Red Bull, Higgs explained the songwriting process provided a kind of catharsis following the year's events: [...] "It wasn't until after we finished that I looked back and thought, bloody hell, I was feeling that very heavily and I didn't realise until it was out of me." ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{month after}} her win at Ascot, Hibaayeb {{was sent to}} Ireland to contest the Irish Oaks at the Curragh. She was {{reported}} as being [...] "in the form of her life" [...] in the build-up to the race and started the 100/30 favourite but made no impact and finished last of the fifteen runners behind Snow Fairy. Her next two races saw little improvement as she finished fourth when favourite for the Preis der Diana in Germany and seventh of eight behind Midday in the Yorkshire Oaks on 19 August. The filly was then sent to the United States to contest the Grade I Yellow Ribbon Stakes over one and a quarter miles at Hollywood Park Racetrack on 2 October {{in which she was}} ridden by Rafael Bejarano. Her opponents included the South African mare Gypsy's Warning, the Beverly Hills Handicap winner Turning Top and the Osunitas Stakes winner Lilly Fa Pootz. Hibaayed recovered from a slow start to move up into third place behind Gypsy's Warning but was forced to the wide outside approaching the final turn. She finished strongly to take the lead 150 yards from the finish and won by a length from Turning Top. Bejarano commented [...] "At the three-eighths I knew I had a lot of horse and I <b>just</b> <b>let</b> her <b>go.</b> <b>It</b> was a perfect trip and I had a lot of confidence". On her final appearance of the year, Hibaayeb started a 25/1 outsider for the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf at Churchill Downs and finished eighth of the eleven runners behind Shared Account.|$|R
