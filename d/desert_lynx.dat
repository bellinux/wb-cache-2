2500|$|Tal Chhapar Sanctuary is a {{very small}} {{sanctuary}} in Sujangarh, Churu District, [...] from Jaipur in the Shekhawati region. This sanctuary is home to a large population of blackbuck. Desert foxes and the caracal, an apex predator, also known as the <b>desert</b> <b>lynx,</b> can also be spotted, along with birds such as the partridge and sand grouse. The great Indian bustard, known locally as the godavan, and which is a state bird, has been classed as critically endangered since 2011.|$|E
5000|$|The Highland Lynx breed {{development}} {{began in}} 1993 as {{a variant of}} the <b>Desert</b> <b>Lynx</b> breed, crossed with the Jungle Curl to add the latter's curled ears. Although given a name that included [...] "lynx", it is without any actual wild lynx (including bobcat) ancestry. Recognized by the Rare and Exotic Feline Registry under the name Highland Lynxes, the nascent breed is classified by REFR as part of the <b>Desert</b> <b>Lynx</b> breeding group, which also includes the <b>Desert</b> <b>Lynx,</b> Alpine Lynx, and Mojave Bob.|$|E
5000|$|In 1996, {{police in}} Fintona, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland shot a cat. It was {{reportedly}} a caracal, a medium-sized wildcat species found in Africa and Asia, although {{a police report}} {{described it as a}} lynx. (Caracals are sometimes called <b>desert</b> <b>lynxes,</b> but are not true members of the Lynx genus.) ...|$|R
50|$|Neither the caracal, {{sometimes}} called the <b>desert</b> <b>lynx,</b> nor the jungle cat, called the jungle lynx, {{is a member of}} the Lynx genus.|$|E
5000|$|Almach was the {{traditional}} name (also spelt as Almaach, Almaack, Almak, Almaak, or Alamak), {{derived from the}} Arabic العناق الأرض (al-‘anāq al-’arđ̧), [...] "the caracal" [...] (<b>desert</b> <b>lynx).</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Rare and Exotic Feline Registry (REFR) is a cat {{registry}} {{founded in}} 1984. The organization specializes in cats [...] "derived from (or alleged to derive from) hybrids with wildcat species". It has recognized unique breeds including the <b>Desert</b> <b>Lynx,</b> Highland Lynx, Alpine Lynx, American Lynx, Mojave Spotted, and Bramble.|$|E
50|$|The Highlander (also {{known as}} the Highlander Shorthair, and {{originally}} as the Highland Lynx), is an experimental breed of cat. The unique appearance of the Highlander comes from the deliberate cross between the <b>Desert</b> <b>Lynx</b> and the Jungle Curl breeds, also recently developed. The latter of these has some non-domestic ancestry from two Asian small cat species, the leopard cat and jungle cat, making the Highlander nominally a feline hybrid, though its foundation stock is mostly domestic cat.|$|E
50|$|Tal Chhapar Sanctuary is a {{very small}} {{sanctuary}} in Sujangarh, Churu District, 210 km from Jaipur in the Shekhawati region. This sanctuary is home to a large population of blackbuck. Desert foxes and the caracal, an apex predator, also known as the <b>desert</b> <b>lynx,</b> can also be spotted, along with birds such as the partridge and sand grouse. The great Indian bustard, known locally as the godavan, and which is a state bird, has been classed as critically endangered since 2011.|$|E
50|$|The Hīt {{offensive}} (2016), {{also known}} as Operation <b>Desert</b> <b>Lynx,</b> was an offensive launched by the Iraqi Government during the Anbar offensive, {{with the goal of}} recapturing the town of Hīt and the Hīt District from ISIL. After the Iraqi forces recaptured the city of Ramadi, Hīt and Fallujah were the only cities still under the control of ISIL in the Al Anbar Governorate. Iraqi Forces fully recaptured of Hīt {{and the rest of the}} Hīt District on 14 April 2016.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Desert</b> <b>Lynx</b> and American Lynx {{experimental}} breeds {{were originally}} {{claimed to be}} bobcat hybrids with around 12.5% wild genes. In spite of their slightly bobcat-like appearance, DNA testing failed to detect bobcat marker genes, and these cats are now considered wholly domestic {{for the purposes of}} ownership, cat fancy registration, and import and export laws. This parallels the case of the Pixie-bob, in that foundation cats in the breed were speculated to be bobcat-domestic hybrids, but were proven all-domestic. The [...] "Lynx" [...] breed group has expanded with the derivative Alpine lynx and Highlander (formerly Highland Lynx) varieties. [...] Few of these ongoing crossbreeding programs are recognized by breed registries as standardized breeds yet.|$|E
5000|$|The Highlander cat is a curl-eared {{variant of}} the <b>Desert</b> <b>Lynx</b> breed, crossed with the Jungle Curl to add the latter's curled ears. As Desert Lynxes, they are bobtailed or short-tailed, have spotted or marbled markings, and {{resemble}} the bobcat. The Highlander has a long sloping forehead and blunt muzzle with a very wide nose. The eyes are wide-set and the ears are upright with a slight curl and a slight turn in the backward direction. Some have polydactyl paws. Highlanders have no known health problems, and are fond of water. The body is substantial and very muscular. Females can grow to between 10 and 14 pounds, and the males between 15 and 20. Despite the [...] "big-cat look", the Highlander is a human-oriented, friendly and playful cat, and very active and confident. The Highlander displays tabby/lynx point or solid point coloration in various colors.|$|E
