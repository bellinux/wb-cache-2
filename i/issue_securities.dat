25|$|Like many South Korean {{companies}} with construction interests, Tongyang Group companies were often highly leveraged; Tongyang Inc., for instance, had a debt-to-equity ratio of 12-to-1 in June 2013. The group faced a cash shortage in September 2013, leading to doubts about {{its ability to}} repay debts maturing {{at the end of}} the month; NICE Investors Service estimated that it needed to raise ₩800 billion to survive. It was reported that the group would <b>issue</b> <b>securities</b> backed by the assets of key subsidiaries, and then liquidate them. On 30 September 2013, Tongyang Group failed to pay back more than ₩100 billion in debt, and officially filed for court receivership for three of its subsidiaries: Tongyang Corp., Tongyang International, and Tongyang Leisure. The list of subsidiaries in receivership soon expanded to five with the addition of Tongyang Networks and Tongyang Cement.|$|E
25|$|The bank charter had various clauses to {{help prevent}} {{possible}} insolvency and reduce risks. Bank officers were not permitted to receive loans at a rate different from that offered to the public. The bank could not <b>issue</b> <b>securities</b> on its own stock, and any loan over $500 had {{to be approved by}} five-sevenths of banks board members. Any losses were to be paid by the individual shareholders up to an amount equal to their stock value. At it highest point, in 1851, the bank had $4 million of bank notes in circulation and $2 million in specie reserves. The bank was an early success. Many who had purchased the stock on credit found that the dividends paid out exceeded the interest they were charged, {{and by the time the}} bank's charter expired almost all of the public stock had been paid for with investors receiving as much a 650% return on investment when the bank closed.|$|E

2500|$|In 2000, Citibank {{introduced}} a new structure for credit card-backed securities, called an issuance trust, which does not have limitations that master trusts sometimes do, that requires each <b>issued</b> series of <b>securities</b> to have both a senior and subordinate tranche.

Instead, private lending institutions approved by Ginnie Mae originate eligible loans, pool them into securities, and issue the Ginnie Mae MBS instruments. These institutions include geographically diverse mortgage companies, commercial banks, and thrifts of all sizes, as well as state housing finance agencies.|$|E
50|$|Securities are the {{traditional}} way that commercial enterprises raise new capital. These may be an attractive alternative to bank loans depending on their pricing and market demand for particular characteristics. Another disadvantage of bank loans {{as a source of}} financing is that the bank may seek a measure of protection against default by the borrower via extensive financial covenants. Through securities, capital is provided by investors who purchase the securities upon their initial issuance. In a similar way, a government may <b>issue</b> <b>securities</b> too when it needs to increase government debt.|$|E

50|$|Securities {{markets can}} be split into below two levels. Primary markets, where new {{securities}} are issued and secondary markets where existing securities {{can be bought}} and sold. Secondary markets can further be split into organised exchanges, such stock exchanges and over-the-counter where individual parties come together and buy or sell securities directly. For securities holders knowing that a secondary market exists in which their securities may be sold and converted into cash increases the willingness of people to hold stocks and bonds and thus increases the ability of firms to <b>issue</b> <b>securities.</b>|$|E
50|$|REMICs are {{investment}} {{vehicles that}} hold {{commercial and residential}} mortgages in trust and <b>issue</b> <b>securities</b> representing an undivided interest in these mortgages. A REMIC assembles mortgages into pools and issues pass-through certificates, multiclass bonds similar to a collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO), or other securities to investors in the secondary mortgage market. Mortgage-backed securities issued through a REMIC can be debt financings of the issuer or a sale of assets. Legal form is irrelevant to REMICs: trusts, corporations, and partnerships may all elect to have REMIC status, and even pools of assets that are not legal entities may qualify as REMICs.|$|E
50|$|If a {{firm has}} to <b>issue</b> <b>securities</b> to finance an investment, the {{existence}} of floatation costs needs a larger amount of securities to be issued. Therefore, the pay out of dividends depend on whether any profits are left after the financing of proposed investments as floatation costs increases the amount of profits used. Deciding how much dividends to be paid is not the concern here, in fact the firm has to decide how much profits to be retained and the rest can then be distributed as dividends. This is the theory of Residuals, where dividends are residuals from the profits after serving proposed investments.|$|E
