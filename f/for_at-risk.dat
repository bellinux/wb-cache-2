5|$|After {{graduate}} school Ahn moved to Seattle {{and worked as}} a psychotherapist. In late 2002 he was dismissed from his job as the supervisor of a group home <b>for</b> <b>at-risk</b> youth in Seattle, after one of the residents accused him of hugging her and holding her hand. In a 2013 retrospective he penned for news portal Rappler, Ahn contended that her allegations were false; made in retaliation for his sanctioning her with loss of privileges for illegal possession of a controlled substance. Thereafter he left the social services and found work in retail management.|$|E
5|$|Prevention options <b>for</b> <b>at-risk</b> {{individuals}} include {{early and}} frequent walking, calf exercises, anticoagulants, aspirin, graduated compression stockings, and intermittent pneumatic compression. Anticoagulation {{is the standard}} treatment; typical medications include low-molecular-weight heparin or a vitamin K antagonist. Wearing graduated compression stockings appears {{to reduce the risk}} of post-thrombotic syndrome. The rate of DVTs increases from childhood to old age; in adulthood, about one in 1000 adults is affected per year.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} and other executive function skills {{are crucial to}} success both in classroom settings and life. A study examining the impact of cognitive intervention <b>for</b> <b>at-risk</b> children in preschool classrooms found that children who received such intervention for {{one to two years}} significantly outperformed their peers. Compared to same-age children who were randomly assigned to the control condition (a literacy unit developed by the school district), preschoolers who received intervention achieved accuracy scores of 85% on tests of inhibitory control (self-discipline), cognitive flexibility, and working memory. Their peers in the control (no intervention) condition, on the other hand, demonstrated only 65% accuracy. Educators involved in this study ultimately opted to implement the cognitive skills training techniques instead of the district-developed curriculum.|$|E
40|$|This report {{explores the}} impact of managed care on {{providing}} preventative mental health services to young children at risk for serious emotional disturbances (SED). The study included a sample of kindergarten and 1 st grade children (n= 121) <b>at-risk</b> <b>for</b> SED that were identified in two public schools. Results of the study indicated that the move to managed care in provision {{of mental health services}} under Medicaid facilitated the provision of services in two ways <b>for</b> children <b>at-risk</b> <b>for</b> SED: (1) by emphasizing a community-based service provider network and provision of services in community-based facilities; and (2) by requiring the development of individualized service plans. Other than this, however, application of managed care to Medicaid acted as a barrier to the provision of mental health services <b>for</b> children <b>at-risk</b> <b>for</b> SED through eligibility requirements. Children eligible for targeted care management were required to have a SED as indicated by a defined mental disorder, be in, or <b>at-risk</b> <b>for,</b> residentia...|$|R

40|$|Five-year driving habit trajectories {{among older}} adults (n = 645) <b>at-risk</b> <b>for</b> crashes were examined. Performance {{measures}} included Useful Field of View (UFOV). Motor-Free Visual Perception Test, Rapid Walk, and Foot Tap. Self-report measures included demographics and the Driving Habits Questionnaire. Longitudinal random-effects models revealed that drivers <b>at-risk</b> <b>for</b> subsequent crashes, based upon UFOV, regulated their driving {{more than the}} lower-risk participants. Restricted driving was present at baseline <b>for</b> the <b>at-risk</b> group and was observed in longitudinal trajectories that controlled for baseline differences. Results indicate that persons <b>at-risk</b> <b>for</b> subsequent crashes increasingly limit their driving over time. Despite this self-regulation, a larger sample of such older drivers was {{twice as likely to}} incur subsequent at-fault crashes. Results suggest that self-regulation among older drivers <b>at-risk</b> <b>for</b> crashes is an insufficient compensatory approach to eliminating increased crash risk.

40|$|Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (fMRI) research indicates that as an individual 2 ̆ 7 s age increases, the task-related spatial extent of neural activation increases. This decrease in neural specificity, or dedifferentiation, is often demonstrated by older adults during challenging cognitive tasks. Cognitively intact individuals <b>at-risk</b> <b>for</b> Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD), as deemed by having an apolipoprotein-E ε 4 allele or {{a family history of}} AD, demonstrate increased fMRI activation as compared to individuals at lower risk. Using a low effort, high accuracy event-related semantic memory task involving the presentation of famous and non-famous names, we examined spatial neural specificity through a measure of dedifferentiation using fMRI. In particular, the goal was to look at degree of dedifferentiation between older healthy subjects with or without risk factors for AD. Our results indicated that while there was not {{a significant difference between the}} two groups on the total amount of neural dedifferentiation, there was a significant interaction between stimulus type and risk group. Individuals <b>at-risk</b> <b>for</b> AD displayed greater dedifferentiation for non-famous names yet greater differentiation (i. e., less dedifferentiation) for famous names as compared to the low-risk group. These findings may reflect disturbances in memory formation <b>for</b> individuals <b>at-risk</b> <b>for</b> AD...|$|R
40|$|Background: Improving access <b>for</b> {{relatives}} <b>at-risk</b> {{of genetic}} conditions by building referral systems from primary care to genetic services is well recognised. Objectives: This study {{aimed to explore}} Primary Care Professionals’ (PCPs) views about using a short, seven-item family history questionnaire (S-FHQ) as an intervention <b>for</b> identifying <b>at-risk</b> relatives of patients with a genetic condition in routine primary care for referral to genetic services. Method: This qualitative {{study was conducted in}} the UK in 2013 - 14. Focus groups were held with 21 PCPs. The Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) was used during analysis as the theoretical lens for exploring potential implementation and sustainability of the intervention. Results: In principle, participants were supportive of the S-FHQ. They initially expressed enthusiasm for the S-FHQ and identified benefits of its use. However, in discussions about its use in practice, they raised concerns about their expertise to deliver the intervention, implications for their workload, potential duplication with existing roles and services in secondary care, the ethical implications of its use in routine care, and its acceptability to patients. Conclusion: This study shows why even a short family history questionnaire, as an intervention <b>for</b> identifying <b>at-risk</b> relatives, is unlikely to be implemented by primary care professionals...|$|R

He proposed to increase spending by $15 million to give incentives for SRI International and Bank of America to keep offices in Virginia. To boost revenue, McDonnell proposed raising $7.2 million by increasing the fines on motorists who exceed the speed limit. He proposed to cut an additional $9.9 million from state funded programs <b>for</b> <b>at-risk</b> and troubled children and proposed cutting $600,000 from state grants to public radio and television stations. McDonnell also issued amendatory vetoes on non-budget legislation. For example, although Virginia has provided free electronic filing of tax returns for years, his veto outsourced electronic filing to firms that charge a fee for that service. McDonnell also amended a bill to prohibit Planned Parenthood from spending funds raised from its affinity license plates on abortions. The Legislature met {{to vote on the}} Governor's amendments on April 21.
