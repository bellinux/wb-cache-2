[...] Cornell, as a real estate developer, presented a convincing case to city developers that a parks system would increase the value of land surrounding it. [...] Cornell based his arguments on New York City's Central Park, which had substantially raised surrounding real estate values. [...] Repeated attempts eventually <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> through the Illinois General Assembly. [...] As a civic leader he along with his peer William Le Baron Jenney, the West Parks commissioner, commissioned urban landscape designers such as Frederick Law Olmsted, Calvert Vaux, Ossian Simonds, H. W. S. Cleveland, and Jens Jensen to create landscaped cemeteries, to implement a coordinated parks and boulevard system and to design the railroad-served suburbs to complement urban civilization.|$|E
500|$|Tarwater {{was devastated}} by the trial results, later saying, [...] "It was the most empty feeling in the world." [...] He went home to Knoxville to reflect on {{swimming}} and life in general. He told his parents {{that he could not}} stand hearing coverage of the Olympics, so his father quickly organized a vacation to Costa Rica. After returning home, Tarwater's uncle, Richmond Flowers Jr., was able to help him through the experience. [...] In 1968, Flowers had been a gold medal favorite in the hurdles before suffering a hamstring injury two months before the Olympic Trials. [...] "I think he knew the pain I was feeling and the disappointment I was feeling, because he felt same thing," [...] Tarwater recalled. Flowers offered perspective, instead of comfort: [...] "I believe there is a God who created this, and it ain't no accident. [...] He's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan...</b> maybe it just wasn't the right thing for you." [...] Soon after, Tarwater met pastor Doug Banister of All Souls Church in Knoxville. After several [...] "really tough conversions" [...] with Banister, Tarwater decided to [...] " [...] life to Christ and basically relinquished control." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1080, {{the castle}} was first {{mentioned}} in a Saxon chronicle. Eisenach itself followed in a document dating to 1150 {{where it was}} referred to as [...] "Isinacha". During the 1180s, the town was established by the construction of three independent market settlements around the Saturday's market (today's Karlsplatz), the Wednesday's market (today's Frauenplan) and the Monday's market (today's Marktplatz). Due to its convenient location at a bottleneck between the Thuringian Forest in the south and the Hainich mountains in the north, Eisenach benefitted from substantial west-east trade along Via Regia from Frankfurt to Erfurt and Leipzig and became a rich merchant town. During {{the second half of the}} 12th century, the town walls were erected (the Nikolaitor is an important relict of this wall) and Eisenach <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>planned</b> grid of streets and alleys. In the late 12th century, the Wartburg became the main residence of the Ludowingians, making Eisenach a leading place in today's western Thuringia and northern Hesse, which also belonged to the Ludowingian landgraviate. In 1207, the legendary Sängerkrieg supposedly took place at Wartburg castle.|$|R

50|$|Carmagnola Castle is {{situated}} {{on a little}} hill in the historic centre of the village.

Now the castle is private but it’s possible to visit it by appointment. It has <b>got</b> <b>a</b> square <b>plan</b> with <b>a</b> central court, and in the past there was a deep defensive ditch with a drawbridge.|$|R
50|$|However one {{obstacle}} {{stands in}} Rimmers way: Enlightenment {{already has a}} full crew and new members can only join on a dead-mans-boots basis. If Rimmer succeeds in an intelligence contest {{it will be at}} the expense of a fellow holograms existence. Rimmer might not be excessively bright but he is shrewd and furthermore hes <b>got</b> <b>a</b> perfect <b>plan</b> — hell cheat. With the assistance of a reluctant Kryten, Rimmer uses a mind-patching operation to significantly increase his IQ. But during the contest the mind-patch fails, as his mind rejects it. Despite this, he is assigned to the Enlightenment when his opponent suddenly withdraws from the challenge. Rimmer bids farewell to his acquaintances on Red Dwarf.|$|R
