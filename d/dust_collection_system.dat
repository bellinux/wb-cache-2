25|$|PTFE {{membrane}} {{filters are}} among the most efficient industrial air filters. PTFE-coated filters are often used in <b>dust</b> <b>collection</b> <b>systems</b> to collect particulate matter from air streams in applications involving high temperatures and high particulate loads such as coal-fired power plants, cement production and steel foundries.|$|R
50|$|Smaller <b>dust</b> <b>collection</b> <b>systems</b> use a {{single-stage}} {{vacuum unit}} to create suction and perform air filtration, where the waste material is drawn into an impeller and deposited into a container {{such as a}} bag, barrel, or canister.

5000|$|Backward-blade fans - Backward-blade fans {{operate at}} higher tip speeds {{and thus are}} more efficient. Since {{material}} may build up on the blades, these fans should be used after a dust collector. Although they are noisier than radial-blade fans, backward-blade fans are commonly used for large-volume <b>dust</b> <b>collection</b> <b>systems</b> because of their higher efficiency.|$|R
50|$|Note that {{in larger}} <b>dust</b> <b>collection</b> <b>system</b> {{installations}} with more available power, multiple blast gates may be {{opened at the}} same time without detriment to collection abilities at individual locations.

Smaller versions, for use in garages or small workshops, are usually electrically powered.

50|$|Important {{parameters}} in specifying {{dust collectors}} include airflow {{the velocity of}} the air stream created by the vacuum producer; system power, {{the power of the}} system motor, usually specified in horsepower; storage capacity for dust and particles, and minimum particle size filtered by the unit.

The weight of collected material above the valve forces the sleeve open to allow a steady discharge. Duckbill sleeve trickle valves have no moving parts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{modeling}} of two alternative <b>dust</b> <b>collection</b> <b>systems</b> in an underground mine-crushing plant was carried out.

In the existing conventional approach, the outgoing dust laden air is collected through an exit in the ceiling. The <b>dust</b> <b>collection</b> performances of both systems were summarized. Detail results are presented in the form of velocity vectors and dust concentration iso-surface contours. Dust was found to be well contained within the crusher bin for the proposed system and stands out as a viable option. However, the velocity magnitudes were found to be high in and around the hole exits, which has the potential to lead to undesirable pressure drop and generation of noise...|$|R
5000|$|Respiratory {{equipment}} and <b>dust</b> <b>collection</b> <b>systems</b> {{are also important}} when woodturning or doing any type of woodworking that creates dust. This can range from a simple disposable dust mask, to a full face helmet with built in respirator. Most stand alone respiratory equipment will interfere with dust shields and visors, so devices that incorporate both are available. Many woods create dust that is actually a health hazard. For example, cocobolo (granadillo) dust {{is known to be}} toxic (toxic shock). Many people are sensitive to oils carried in walnut, locust, and oak sawdust. Long term exposure to fine wood dust has also been linked with an increased risk of developing cancer.|$|R

50|$|Cocobolo {{heartwood}} contains oil. This oil lends a strong, unmistakable floral odor even to well {{seasoned wood}} and occasionally stains the hands with prolonged exposure. The high natural oil {{content of the}} wood {{makes it difficult to}} achieve a strong glue joint and can inhibit the curing of some varnishes, particularly oil-based finishes. Acetone may be used to remove surface oils before gluing. The oil can induce allergic reactions if inhaled or exposed to unprotected skin and eyes.

50|$|Although many scene {{shops are}} located in general purpose building, most are in purpose built spaces because scenic {{fabrication}} has some fairly specific needs. Often they are in very large, open rooms, to accommodate big elements that a show may call for.

If they are attached to a performance venue, it is also common to have large doors providing access to the stage. Typically, compressed air and <b>dust</b> <b>collection</b> <b>systems</b> are distributed around the shop. Many processes in a scene shop such as spray painting, welding, or hot-wire foam cutting produce dangerous gasses, so often extra ventilation is installed. Ideally, fume <b>collection</b> <b>systems</b> are available to use near the actual workpiece.

40|$|Recently the United States Bureau of Mines dust {{research}} program studied small surface mine drills {{to assess their}} dust generation hazards {{and the effect of}} dust control technologies implemented. Most of the drills were truck mounted and used Rotoclone dry <b>dust</b> <b>collection</b> <b>systems.</b> Initial <b>dust</b> source surveys and the assessment of dust control enhancements for small mobile rock drills were presented in this report. A significant amount of airborne respirable dust was emitted from the Rotoclone type dust collector. Respirable dust concentrations measured around the drill deck ranged from 8. 658 to 95. 15 mg/m 3 with concentrations ranging from 1. 37 to 2. 69 mg/m 3 at distances of 12. 2 to 30. 5 meters downwind. Wind direction and speed were factors in the dust concentrations measured on the bench. Dust collector improvements were made on several drills to control dust from the emission sources. The results showed that adding a low flow of water to the collector exhaust may reduce the dust emitted by 92 %, increasing drill deck shroud containment and increasing the Rotoclone speed may reduce respirable dust levels by 63 %, vertically extending the Rotoclone exhaust may reduce downwind respirable dust levels by 62 %, and enclosing the Rotoclone hopper discharge may reduce levels by 80 %. Wet drilling, by injecting small amounts of water into the bailing air, appeared to be more effective than an improved Rotoclone drill deck shroud by 29 %. Repositioning the operator away from the drill during most of its operation can keep him or her out of the dust cloud and reduce dust levels by 69 %. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 NIOSHTIC no. 0023393...|$|R
