25|$|Everyone {{can imagine}} how terrified the peasant must have been when he saw Thor making his brows sink <b>down</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> eyes; as for what could be seen of the eyes themselves, {{he thought he would}} {{collapse}} at just the very sight. Thor clenched his hands on the shaft of the hammer so that the knuckles went white, and the peasant did as one might expect, and all his household, they cried out fervently, begged for grace, offered to atone with all their possessions.|$|E

Sikh clergy and its representative body, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) demanded an apology from Singh and demanded that Pernod Ricard India withdraw the ad, which the SGPC termed, an [...] "offensive representation which has hurt the feelings of Sikhs."

500|$|Although Woodfull led Australia to a {{dramatic}} victory by 111 runs, his form {{was a problem}} as he managed only 10 and 26; he was also hit by the bowling. The bodyline controversy reached its peak during {{the second day of}} the third Test. An all-time record Adelaide Oval crowd of 50,962 watched Australia finish off England's first innings for 341. Then, Woodfull opened Australia's batting with Jack Fingleton, who was dismissed straight away for a duck. Minutes later Larwood, bowling to a conventional field setting, struck Woodfull an agonising blow under his heart with a short, lifting delivery. As Woodfull bent <b>down</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> bat in pain for several minutes, an image that became one of the defining symbols of the series, the huge crowd began jeering, hooting and verbally abusing the English team, something that was almost unheard of for the social standards of the era. Jardine reacted by saying [...] "Well bowled, Harold".|$|E
500|$|The Great Dining Room is {{situated}} in the east wing extension {{of the house and}} was added in 1877 under J. MacVicar Anderson {{during the time of the}} Red Earl. The room was inspired by the ballroom of Buckingham Palace, with walls hung with faded, red damask silk. The Spencers ate their regular meals in the Tapestry Dining Room, an inner room of the east side to the east of the Wooton Hall. Aside from the two fine vividly constructed tapestries, one of gypsies and one of farming, the room is fairly bleak in design compared to other rooms in the house; the dining table is relatively small, with a drab grey floor and open brick fireplace dated in large letters to 1683. The [...] "sombre" [...] oak panelling originally came from the family's other property of Wormleighton Manor in Warwickshire. [...] Charles Spencer recalled that three generations of Spencers would eat their lunch together and that dining conditions were [...] "silent, apart from the noises of my grandfather eating with great gusto, a napkin tucked in around his neck, hanging <b>down</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> popping-out tummy, and it was all very sad and tense".|$|E
500|$|The feud between The Undertaker and Randy Orton and [...] "Cowboy" [...] Bob Orton {{began at}} SummerSlam. At the event, Randy faced off against Undertaker. During the match, [...] "Cowboy" [...] Bob (disguised as a fan) {{came into the}} ring and {{interrupted}} the match. Following this, Randy pinned Undertaker after he jumped and pulled Undertaker's head <b>down</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulders, a move dubbed the RKO, to win. After the match, Randy peeled off the latex mask of the fan and revealed him to be his father, [...] "Cowboy" [...] Bob. On the September 16 episode of SmackDown!, Undertaker defeated Randy. During the match, [...] "Cowboy" [...] Bob drove a U-Haul truck down to the ring and unloaded a casket. As Undertaker went to put Randy inside the casket, he opened it and found a mannequin of himself inside. Despite this distraction, Undertaker pinned Randy after he drove Randy's head into the mat in an upside down position, a move called the Tombstone Piledriver. The following week, druids wheeled out a casket. Undertaker appeared on the TitonTron and urged The Ortons to look inside. The Ortons opened the casket and found mannequins of themselves inside. Undertaker then proclaimed {{that this would be}} their fate at No Mercy.|$|E

2500|$|A {{reference}} to Julian Eltinge {{is found in}} Buster Keaton's comedy Seven Chances (1925). In the film, Keaton's character must marry before 7:00 PM {{in order to receive}} a large inheritance. [...] After many failed attempts to find an instant bride, he sees a poster with a woman's photo outside a performance hall and, in an act of desperation, enters to ask for her hand in marriage. [...] While Keaton is inside, a stagehand removes some boxes to reveal the woman's name on the poster: Julian Eltinge. [...] Keaton then emerges from the theater with a black eye and his boater hat smashed <b>down</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> head.|$|E

He wears waraji straw sandals, a casual black eboshi cap, and a two-piece kamishimo under a black haori coat. The handles of his two swords peak out behind him on the left, the customary position. His red kumadori makeup is typical of main characters, signifying [...] "bravado and a forceful personality." [...] Hanging <b>down</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> right knee is a handful of wheat or rice stalks, which are presumably an element of the drama.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his eye injury {{less than}} 6 months before, {{he made his}} Test debut playing against England in Delhi in December 1961. [...] He found it easiest to play with his cap pulled <b>down</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> damaged right eye. [...] He scored 103 in the Third Test in Madras, helping India to its first series win against England. [...] He was {{appointed}} vice-captain for the tour to the West Indies in 1962. [...] In March 1962, Mansoor became captain of the Indian cricket team after the sitting captain Nari Contractor was ruled out of the Fourth Test in Barbados due to an injury sustained by Contractor batting against Charlie Griffith in a tour match against Barbados. [...] At 21 years and 77 days, he held the world record for the youngest Test captain until he was surpassed by Tatenda Taibu in May 2004.

2500|$|Clancy {{had long}} been a strong {{supporter}} of the Irish leader Charles Stewart Parnell. [...] When a majority of the Irish Parliamentary Party turned against Parnell in November 1890, following what amounted to a demand by the Liberal leader, Gladstone, that Parnell should stand <b>down</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> involvement with Katharine O'Shea, Clancy rapidly emerged as one of Parnell's key defenders. [...] On the third day of the Irish Party's week-long debate on Parnell's leadership in Committee Room 15 of the House of Commons, Clancy proposed an amendment that attempted to compromise by seeking further views from Gladstone and the other British Liberal Party leaders. [...] Although this move held off a decision for another three days, it was ultimately unsuccessful. [...] Clancy was among the minority who stayed with Parnell when the party split on 6 December 1890 into the pro-Parnellite Irish National League (INL) and the anti-Parnellite Irish National Federation (INF). [...] He later joined the editorial staff of the Irish Daily Independent, which was founded to support the Parnellite cause.|$|E

A guerrilla learns how to derail and wreck trains, blow up tanks, destroy planes on the ground, dynamite bridges. In taking sentries, advises Mr. Levy, the back is the best approach. If that is not possible, the guerrilla covers the sentry with his revolver, steps on his foot, unbuttons his tunic and jerks it <b>down</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> arms to lock them. [...] "You may slap his ears with the revolver barrel, to intimidate him[...] [...] [...] You should also drop his trousers to lock his feet." [...] [...] [...] Invisible weapons might include: a [...] [...] [...] lady's hatpin, or a wrist knife strapped to the wrist with the hilt downwards; a knife hung around the neck; a small revolver held up the sleeve by rubber bands; a stiletto with a nine-inch blade[...] [...] [...] a hammer, cheese-cutters (wires with wooden handles, handy for garroting); a handkerchief with a fistful of sand in it.

2500|$|Kobolds {{who live}} in human homes are {{generally}} depicted as humanlike, dressed as peasants, and standing about as tall as a four-year-old child. A legend recorded by folklorist Joseph Snowe from a place called Alte Burg in 1839 tells of a creature [...] "in {{the shape of a}} short, thick-set being, neither boy nor man, but akin to the condition of both, garbed in a party-coloured loose surcoat, and wearing a high-crowned hat with a broad brim on his diminutive head." [...] The kobold Hödekin (also known as Hüdekin and Hütchen) of Hildesheim wore a little hat <b>down</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> face (Hödekin means [...] "little hat"). Another type of kobold known as the Hütchen is said to be [...] tall, with red hair and beard, and clad in red or green clothing and a red hat and may even be blind. [...] Yet other tales describe kobolds appearing as herdsmen looking for work and little, wrinkled old men in pointed hoods. [...] Some kobolds resemble small children. According to dramatist and novelist X. B. Saintine, kobolds are the spirits of dead children and often appear with a knife that represents the means by which they were put to death. Heinzelmann, a kobold from the folklore of Hudermühlen Castle in the region of Lüneburg, appeared as a beautiful boy with blond, curly hair to his shoulders and dressed in a red silk coat. His voice was [...] "soft and tender like that of a boy or maiden." ...|$|E
