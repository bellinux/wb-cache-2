40|$|In Africa, highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} H 5 N 1 virus was first detected in northern Nigeria and later also {{in other regions}} of the country. Since then, seven other African countries have reported H 5 N 1 infections. This study reports a comparison of full-length genomic sequences of H 5 N 1 isolates from seven chicken farms in Nigeria and chicken and <b>hooded</b> <b>vultures</b> in Burkina Faso with earlier H 5 N 1 outbreaks worldwide. In addition, the antigenicity of Nigerian H 5 N 1 isolates was compared with earlier strains. All African strains clustered within three sublineages denominated A (south-west Nigeria, Niger), B (south-west Nigeria, Egypt, Djibouti) and C (northern Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Sudan, Côte d'Ivoire), with distinct nucleotide and amino acid signatures and distinct geographical distributions within Africa. Probable non-African ancestors within the west Asian/Russian/European lineage distinct from the south-east Asian lineages were identified for each sublineage. All reported human cases in Africa were caused by sublineage B. Substitution rates were calculated on the basis of sequences from 11 strains from a single farm in south-west Nigeria. As H 5 N 1 emerged essentially {{at the same time in}} the north and south-west of Nigeria, the substitution rates confirmed that the virus probably did not spread from the north to the south, given the observed sequence diversity, but that it entered the country via three independent introductions. The strains from Burkina Faso seemed to originate from northern Nigeria. At least two of the sublineages also circulated in Europe in 2006 as seen in Germany, further suggesting that the sublineages had already emerged outside of Africa and seemed to have followed the east African/west Asian and Black Sea/Mediterranean flyways of migratory birds...|$|R
50|$|The {{martial eagle}} is {{to some degree}} {{adaptable}} to varied habitats but shows an overall preference for open woods and woodland edges, wooded savannah and thornbush habitats. The martial eagle has been recorded at elevations of up to 3000 m but is not a true mountain dwelling species and resident eagles do not usually exceed an elevation of 1500 m. These eagles also avoid closed-canopy forests and hyper-arid desert. As such it is mostly absent from Guinean and Congolian forests, despite the species’ requirement for large trees for nesting purposes. It is shown that martial eagles can inhabit forests locally in areas where openings occur. For example, in a bird atlas for the country of Kenya, perhaps surprisingly, 88% of martial eagles were found to reside in well-wooded areas and they occurred in areas where annual rainfall exceeded 250 mm. In southern Africa, they have adapted to seemingly more open habitats than elsewhere in their range, such as semi-desert and open savanna with scattered trees, wooded hillocks and, as a recent adaptation, around pylons. In the desert areas of Namibia, they utilize ephemeral rivers that flow occasionally and allow large trees to grow. They usually seem to prefer desolate or protected areas. In the Karoo of South Africa, they consistently avoid areas with moderate to heavy cultivation or with heavier or more consistent winter rainfall. One study on the occurrence of diurnal raptors in protected areas versus outside unprotected areas, found that martial eagle detection was nearly twice as frequent in protected areas {{during the dry season}} and more than three times as frequent during the wet season. Some assorted diurnal raptors were even relatively rarer outside of protected areas such as <b>hooded</b> <b>vultures</b> (Necrosyrtes monachus).|$|R
5000|$|The [...] <b>hooded</b> <b>vulture</b> (Necrosyrtes monachus) is an Old World vulture in {{the order}} Accipitriformes, which also {{includes}} eagles, kites, buzzards and hawks. It is {{the only member of}} the genus Necrosyrtes and is native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is a scruffy-looking, small vulture with dark brown plumage, a long thin bill, bare crown, face and fore-neck, and a downy nape and hind-neck. It typically scavenges on carcasses. Although this is a common species, numbers of these birds are decreasing rapidly. Threats include poisoning, hunting and loss of habitat, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as [...] "critically endangered".|$|E

A single endemic bird species, the northern bald ibis (Geronticus eremita) occurs here, and there are about 12 globally endangered species; the white-headed duck (Oxyura leucocephala), the Balearic shearwater (Puffinus mauretanicus), the northern bald ibis, the Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), the lappet-faced vulture (Torgos tracheliotos), the <b>hooded</b> <b>vulture</b> (Necrosyrtes monachus), the white-backed vulture (Gyps africanus), the Rüppell's vulture (Gyps rueppelli), the sociable lapwing (Vanellus gregarius), the slender-billed curlew (Numenius tenuirostris), the great knot (Calidris tenuirostris) and the saker falcon (Falco cherrug). Other birds with restricted ranges in north Africa include the Levaillant's woodpecker (Picus vaillantii), the Moussier's redstart (Phoenicurus moussieri) and the Tristram's warbler (Sylvia deserticola).|$|E
50|$|There {{are reports}} of Verreaux's eagle-owls attacking even larger {{raptorial}} birds. A case of the Verreaux's eagle-owl killing an adult Pel's fishing owl in Botswana was verified. At roughly 2000 g in body mass, the fishing owl is of nearly {{the same size as}} the eagle-owl. Cases where they’ve attacked the nests of particularly large diurnal birds of prey have sometimes involved only nestlings being victimized, such as attacks on the <b>hooded</b> <b>vulture</b> (Necrosyrtes monachus) and the bateleur (Terathopius ecaudatus), none of the adults, which are about the same average adult body mass as the Verreaux's eagle-owls, have been reported as prey. However, in some even larger birds of prey, adults as well as nestlings and fledglings have been killed. Successful nighttime attacks have been reported on adults of the 2810 g African fish eagle (Haliaeetus vocifer) and the 4017 g secretarybird (Sagittarius serpentarius). In the Matobo Hills of Zimbabwe, the Verreaux's eagle-owl has been considered as one of the inferred predators of 4195 g Verreaux's eagle (Aquila verreauxii), although whether adults or only nestlings are vulnerable is not definitely clear.|$|E
50|$|Overall, the {{lappet-faced vulture}} is blackish above with a {{strongly}} contrasting white thigh feathers. The black feathers {{on the back}} of African vultures are lined with brown, while Arabian birds are dark brown rather than black above. The underside can range from pure white to buff-brown. Like many vultures, it has a bald head. The head coloration can range from reddish in southern Africa to dull pink in more northern Africa to pink {{on the back of}} the head and gray on the front in the Arabian Peninsula. The combination of the colorful head and fleshy folds on the side of it are distinctive. The bald head of the lappet-faced vulture is advantageous, because a feathered head would become spattered with blood and other fluids, and thus be difficult to keep clean. While flying, lappet-faced vultures have large, broad wings held with the front edges held parallel and slightly pointed, serrated-looking wingtips. Compared to the somewhat similarly marked <b>hooded</b> <b>vulture,</b> it is considerably larger with a more massive bill and can only be confused at a great distance. The Gyps vultures are generally much paler, with less white lining the wings and more bulging secondaries. The cinereous vulture (which may overlap in range in the Arabian area) has a similar body shape but is all dark, with no contrasting plumage.|$|E
50|$|The {{range of}} lizard buzzards is {{extremely}} large {{and does not}} approach the threshold for vulnerable under range distribution.The population trend appears to be stable and does not approach thresholds for vulnerable.The population size is extremely large and for these reasons is evaluated as least concern.However, in Africa particularly West and Southern Africa there have been recorded dramatic declines in some raptors. The reasons for raptor decline in Africa are rapid human population growth driving overexploitation of the land causing biodiveristy loss and a decreased species richness. The raptor population declines in West Africa {{have been linked to}} loss of woodland and nest sites,increased pesticide use,intensive cultivation especially cotton and disturbance of nests. In Southern Africa raptor decline has been linked to use of poisons,powerline electrocutions, habitat destruction and raptor drowning in farm reservoirs. Despite high human population and activity in Africa, not all raptor species have declined sharply.Some raptors, especially opportunistic generalists and migrants have increased. In West Africa the grasshopper buzzard, black kite and <b>hooded</b> <b>vulture</b> have increased in number and range. Similarly in the Western Cape of South Africa, the steppe buzzard, lesser kestrel and yellow-billed kite have increased range and number. Currently there is insufficient data on the Lizard Buzzard to determine its adaptation to human land usage.It is unclear how it has adapted to loss of Woodland its preferred habitat and nesting site.Its preferred prey insects, lizards and rodents remain common in most human altered landscapes which could account for its current survival.|$|E
50|$|The {{martial eagle}} {{infrequently}} hunts other birds of prey, perhaps doing so {{only slightly more}} often than do crowned eagles and Verreaux's eagles. In comparison, the temperate-zone-dwelling golden eagle is a fairly prolific predator of other birds of prey. This {{may be due to}} more scarce prey resources in colder regions forcing eagles to pursue difficult prey such as this more frequently, whereas booted eagles in rich Africa biospheres may not need to do so as much. Nonetheless, a somewhat diverse range of raptorial birds have been identified as prey for martial eagles: the 0.61 kg lanner falcon (Falco biarmicus), the 0.65 kg spotted eagle owl (Bubo africanus) (with a surprisingly large number of 6 found at one nest in Tsavo East), the 0.67 kg pale chanting goshawk (Melierax canorus), the 2.04 kg <b>hooded</b> <b>vulture</b> (Necrosyrtes monachus) (in one case after a protracted aerial battle), the 4.17 kg white-headed vulture (Trigonoceps occipitalis) and even Africa’s largest bird of prey, the 9.28 kg Cape vulture (Gyps coprotheres). As apex predators, martial eagles are themselves largely invulnerable to predation. A video exists that purportedly depicts a leopard killing a martial eagle but this eagle was misidentified as it actually features a leopard preying on an immature African fish eagle (Haliaeetus vociferus) (and, at that, one that was possibly grounded for unknown reasons). There are, however, verified (if rare) cases of caracals preying on sleeping martial eagles at night, by climbing trees and pouncing in an ambush. It is possible that leopards may too ambush sleeping eagles but post-fledgling martial eagles are known to be highly wary and healthy individuals a great majority of the time will successfully evade potential dangers by day. Predation on nests of martial eagles, beyond those by humans, are little-known, with no verified depredations known in the literature, but are likely to occur.|$|E

40|$|So far {{overlooked}} as a pigment {{involved in}} visual communication, the haemoglobin {{contained in the}} blood of all birds is responsible for the red flushing colours in bare skin areas of some species. Our aim has been twofold: (1) to study sub-epidermical adaptations for blood circulation in two flushing species: the crested caracara (Polyborus plancus) and the <b>hooded</b> <b>vulture</b> (Necrosyrtes monachus), and (2) to provide the first compilation of avian species with flushing skin. The bare facial skin of both the caracara and the <b>hooded</b> <b>vulture</b> contains a highly vascularised tissue under the epidermis that may be filled with blood and would thus produce red skin colours. In contrast, feathered areas of the head show very few vessels immersed in connective tissue and have no potential for colour changes. Species with flushing colours are few but phylogenetically diverse, as they belong to 12 different avian orders and at least 20 families. The majority are dark-coloured, large-sized species living in hot environments that may have originally evolved highly vascularised skin patches for thermoregulation. Bird behaviour as well as sex and age differences within species suggest that a signalling system for condition or status based on haemoglobin may have been super-imposed to the physiological process of heat dissipation. “Blushing is the most peculiar and the most human of all expressions.

The <b>Hooded</b> <b>Vulture</b> Necrosyrtes monachus {{is known as a}} rare breeding resident in north-eastern South Africa. This study set out to monitor the nests of Hooded Vultures and, secondarily, White-backed Vultures Gyps africanus in the Olifants River Private Nature Reserve over two breeding seasons in 2013 and 2014. A total of 12 <b>Hooded</b> <b>Vulture</b> nests, placed mostly in the tree Diospyros mespiliformis, were found along the Olifants River, with an average internest distance of 0. 76 km. Nest success was estimated to be between 0. 44 – 0. 89 offspring pair− 1 y− 1 in 2013 and 0. 50 – 0. 67 offspring pair− 1 y− 1 in 2014, which are the first estimates for Hooded Vultures in South Africa.

40|$|Despite major {{declines in}} the {{population}} of vultures around the world, noticeable increases were reported in the populations of Hooded Vultures Necrosyrtes monachus {{over the past decade}} in Accra—an important vulture habitat in Ghana. In recent times, however, there is a growing concern that the vulture numbers are decreasing even though scientific data to support this is nonexisting. As a vital zoogeographical and conservation tool, {{it is important to keep}} an up-to-date knowledge about urban bird populations amidst rapid urbanization and associated changes. Using a combination of field data, literature review, and stakeholder consultations, it was indicative that severe decline might have indeed occurred in the populations of Hooded Vultures in Accra. Evidence suggests the killing of vultures for consumption, traditional medicine, and black magic in an undercover trade with possible transboundary connections as important underlying factor. Additional factors suspected to underlie the declines include changes in management of urban facilities and destruction of roosting and nesting trees. The implications of interspecific competition with Pied Crows Corvus albus on Hooded Vultures however remain unclear.

40|$|West African flood-plains have {{undergone}} major land-use transformations {{in the second}} half of the 20 th century. To obtain insight in the effect of flood-plain development for irrigated rice cultivation on the abundance, richness, and diversity of Palearctic and Afrotropical raptors, we conducted monthly transect surveys covering dry and wet seasons in four major habitats on the Waza-Logone flood-plain of Cameroon: dry grasslands, cultivated grasslands, rice fields, and seasonally flooded grasslands resembling natural flood-plain vegetation. We recorded 36 raptor species among 2, 533 individuals, dominated by Black Kite Milvus migrans, which comprised 42 % of counts. Although richness and diversity were not related to land-use for Palearctic raptors, Afrotropical raptor diversity was higher on the flooded grasslands compared to the newly created cultivated habitats and dry grasslands. The abundance of Afrotropical raptors did not significantly differ across habitats but was lower in rice-fields when Black Kite and <b>Hooded</b> <b>Vulture</b> Necrosyrtes monachus were excluded. Conversely, Palearctic raptor abundance was highest in post-harvest rice fields, demonstrating the importance of the rice fields as foraging habitat for Palearctic raptors. Further transformation of West Africa’s flood-plains is expected, reducing their capacity for Afrotropical raptors, while Palearctic raptors may benefit from expansion of rice-fields, but more research is needed on their vulnerability to pesticide use...|$|E
40|$|Diurnal raptors have {{declined}} significantly in western Africa since the 1960 s. To evaluate {{the impact of}} traditional medicine and bushmeat trade on raptors, we examined carcasses offered at markets at 67 sites (1 – 80 stands per site) in 12 countries in western Africa during 1990 – 2013. Black kiteMilvus migransand <b>hooded</b> <b>vulture</b> Necrosyrtes monachus together accounted for 41 % of 2, 646 carcasses comprising 52 species. Twenty-seven percent of carcasses were of species categorized as Near Threatened, Vulnerable or Endangered on the IUCN Red List. Common species were traded more frequently than rarer species, as were species with frequent scavenging behaviour (vs non-scavenging), generalist or savannah habitat use (vs forest), and an Afrotropical (vs Palearctic) breeding range. Large Afrotropical vultures were recorded in the highest absolute and relative numbers in Nigeria, whereas in Central Africa, palm-nut vultures Gypohierax angolensis were the most abundant vulture species. Estimates based on data extrapolation indicated that within West Africa 73 % of carcasses were traded in Nigeria, 21 % in Benin and 5 % elsewhere. Offtake per annum in West Africa {{was estimated to be}} 975 – 1, 462 hooded vultures, 356 – 534 palm-nut vultures, 188 – 282 Rüppell's griffons Gyps rueppellii, 154 – 231 African white-backed vultures Gyps africanus, 143 – 214 lappet-faced vultures Torgos tracheliotos, and 40 – 60 crowned eagles Stephanoaetus coronatus. This represents a sizeable proportion of regional populations, suggesting that trade is likely to be contributing significantly to declines.

Species were included in the model on the basis of internationally recognized vulnerability to these interactions at the family level. The collision model performed poorly when tested against the actual reported mortalities for species contained in the Eskom-EWT Strategic Partnership Central Incident Register CIR) (chi-square of goodness of fit) at the individual species, family and within family levels. The electrocution model performed slightly better at the family, and within family level. Both collision and electrocution models performed better for the physically larger species (and families) and for those species with higher modelled probability of collision or electrocution. As the product of random carcass detection and reporting, the CIR data are biased in various ways. Testing the models against the CIR is therefore equally important for highlighting inadequacies in the CIR, as in the model. A number of new species have emerged as being of high collision (including most importantly African Pygmy Goose, Southern Ground Hornbill, Black-bellied Bustard, Yellow-throated Sandgrouse, Caspian Tern, <b>Hooded</b> <b>Vulture,</b> Bateleur, African Marsh Harrier, Black Harrier, Pink-backed Pelican and Yellow-billed Stork) or electrocution (Southern Bald Ibis) probability in theoretical terms, and will require further investigation to determine their actual probability of interaction.

40|$|Strong raptor {{population}} declines {{have recently}} been reported in sub-Saharan West Africa, where the pressure on wildlife and their supporting habitats is particularly high. This makes it imperative to understand the role of land-use on landscape-scale patterns of raptors and to define priority areas for conservation. We examine landscape-scale community patterns of raptors in biogeographical zones with different degrees of anthropogenic land-use and assess the role of protected areas in maintaining such patterns. We recorded raptors along road transects in Cameroon’s savannas, covering four years and 7, 340 – 7, 700 km in wet and dry seasons, in three biogeographical zones: the relatively well-preserved Inundation and Guinea zones {{to the north and}} south of the heavily exploited Sudan zone. The Inundation zone had the largest species pool and Palearctic raptor richness and abundance. The Guinea zone had the largest Afrotropical raptor species pool, while raptor diversity and richness were higher there than in the Sudan zone. The abundance of only one species (Fox Kestrel) peaked in the Sudan zone and only one large-bodied raptor (<b>Hooded</b> <b>Vulture)</b> with a Sudan-centered distribution was more common there than in the other zones. Our results suggest that land-use as determined by protected areas and human exploitation may override the role of biogeographical zonation in shaping raptor assemblages. Comparable patterns of raptor richness and diversity inside and outside protected areas suggest that both protected areas and partly cultivated peripheral zones act as important foraging and source areas, ensuring the preservation of diverse raptor assemblages at the landscape scale. Finally, our data illustrate the comparatively high richness of Cameroon’s and West Africa’s savanna raptor communities on a continental and global scale, underlining their importance for raptor conservation. ...|$|E
