25|$|The aim of <b>image</b> <b>restoration</b> is {{the removal}} of noise (sensor noise, motion blur, etc.) from images. The {{simplest}} possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as low-pass filters or median filters. More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look like, a model which distinguishes them from the noise. By first analysing the image data {{in terms of the}} local image structures, such as lines or edges, and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step, a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches.|$|E
40|$|X-ray cone-beam {{computed}} tomography (CT) has the notable {{features such as}} high efficiency and precision, and is widely used {{in the fields of}} medical imaging and industrial non-destructive testing, but the inherent imaging degradation reduces the quality of CT images. Aimed at the problems of projection <b>images</b> degradation and <b>restoration</b> in cone-beam CT, a point spread function (PSF) modeling method is proposed firstly. The general PSF model of cone-beam CT is established, and based on it, the PSF under arbitrary scanning conditions can be calculated directly for projection <b>images</b> <b>restoration</b> without the additional measurement, which greatly improved the application convenience of cone-beam CT. Secondly, a projection <b>images</b> <b>restoration</b> algorithm based on pre-filtering and pre-segmentation is proposed, which can make the edge contours in projection images and slice <b>images</b> clearer after <b>restoration,</b> and control the noise in the equivalent level to the original images. Finally, the experiments verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methods. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|This report {{relates to}} the field of <b>image</b> <b>restorations</b> and {{features}} extracting from noisy and blurred images. Since their introduction in a classical paper by Rudin, Osher and Fatemi, Total Variation (TV) minimising models have {{become one of the most}} popular and successful tools for <b>image</b> <b>restorations.</b> Whilst invariance under affine transformations is very important for many image processing tasks, the total variation functional is not invariant under general affine transformation. In the current report we introduce for the first time a new affine invariant regularization functional which has many properties similar to total variation and can be used for affine invariant denoising and restoration tasks. The explicit formula for calculation of this regularization functional is given...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we want to}} {{implement}} {{a new approach to}} the nonlinear degraded <b>images</b> <b>restoration</b> problem which is useful for neutron radiography gray images enhancement. We attempt to reconstruct or recover an image that has been degraded, using some a priori knowledge of the degradation phenomenon. Our approach is based on using swarm intelligence optimization algorithms such as particles swarm (PSO) to solve a least squares minimization ill-posed problem. Many works have been done using intelligence techniques, ranging from neural networks, fuzzy logic and evolutionary algorithms, to swarm intelligence that we will try to use to minimize the Total Variation (TV). Instead of the standard Tikhonov regularization method which is most often used and to get smoothed images in presence of noise, a Laplacian constraint is introduced for regularization purposes. Using some image quality metrics such as Mean Square Error (MSE) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), we can judge that PSO algorithm yields excellent results and good efficiency in noisy <b>images</b> <b>restoration.</b> These results indicate that the use of particle swarm optimization algorithm enables us to perform neutron radiography <b>images</b> <b>restoration</b> properly...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we review}} an {{implementation}} of the Ridgelet transform: The Discrete Analytical Ridgelet Transform (DART). This transform uses the Fourier strategy for the computation of the associated 2 -D and 3 -D discrete Radon transforms. The innovative step {{is the definition of}} a discrete 3 -D transform and the construction of discrete analytical lines in the Fourier domain. These discrete analytical lines have a parameter called arithmetical thickness, allowing us to define a DART adapted to a specific application. Indeed, the DART representation is not orthogonal, it is associated with a flexible redundancy factor. The DART has a very simple forward/inverse algorithm that provides an exact reconstruction without any iterative method. We had proved in different publications that the 2 D and 3 D DART are performant for the level of greys <b>images</b> <b>restorations.</b> Therefore we have interesting to 2 D/ 3 D color <b>image</b> <b>restorations.</b> We have compared the restoration results in function of different color space definition and importance of the white Gaussian noise. We criticize our results with two different measures : the Signal Noise Ratio calculation and perceptual measures to evaluate the perceptual colour difference between original and denoised images. These experimental results show that the simple thresholding of the DART coefficients is competitive than classical denoising techniques...|$|R
