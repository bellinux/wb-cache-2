5|$|A weak wave in the ITCZ {{organized}} into Tropical Depression Ten-E on August 30. It headed west-northwest and quickly intensified into {{a tropical storm}} and eventually, a hurricane. Hernan then began rapidly <b>deepening,</b> <b>reaching</b> Category5 intensity on September 1. It maintained that intensity for 12hours before tracking over cooler waters. The storm weakened steadily, with wind shear contributing to its deterioration. Hernan then degenerated into a remnant low on September 6. The low turned to the southwest and dissipated three days later.|$|R

Since the 1960 s {{there has been}} a continued development and diversification of digital technologies used across societal sectors (Bijker, Hughes, Pinch, & Douglas, 2012), enabling applications not solely within business and commerce, but significantly within educational and social settings (such as those discussed by The Metiri Group, 2006, for example), supporting communication and learning (for example, shown by Richardson, 2012), providing opportunities to widen and <b>deepen</b> <b>reach</b> and interactions (as indicated, for example, by Kim, Hagashi, Carillo, Gonzales, Makany, Lee, & Gàrate, 2011). It can be argued that such developments have created many divisions and challenges too (Resta, & Laferrière, 2008); individuals as well as nations may not have the same access or facilities as others (ITU, 2015); and issues such as exploitation and exclusion are regularly highlighted (Dutta, Geiger, & Lanvin, 2015).
