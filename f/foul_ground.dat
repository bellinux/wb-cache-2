5|$|Similarly, {{there are}} no {{regulations}} at all concerning the dimensions of foul territory. Thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the stands, but a foulout in a park with more expansive <b>foul</b> <b>ground.</b> A fence in foul territory that {{is close to the}} outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders, while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions, as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner. These variations can make the difference between a double and a triple or inside-the-park home run. The surface of the field is also unregulated. While the adjacent image shows a traditional field surfacing arrangement (and the one used by virtually all MLB teams with naturally surfaced fields), teams are free to decide what areas will be grassed or bare. Some fields—including several in MLB—use an artificial surface, such as AstroTurf. Surface variations can {{have a significant effect on}} how ground balls behave and are fielded as well as on baserunning. Similarly, the presence of a roof (seven major league teams play in stadiums with permanent or retractable roofs) can greatly affect how fly balls are played. While football and soccer players deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering, the size and shape of their fields are much more standardized. The area out-of-bounds on a football or soccer field does not affect play the way foul territory in baseball does, so variations in that regard are largely insignificant.|$|E
25|$|Because it {{was unusually}} {{low to the}} playing field, the air-inflated dome {{occasionally}} figured into game action. Major League Baseball had specific ground rules for the Metrodome. Any ball which struck the Dome roof, or objects hanging from it, remained in play; if it landed in foul territory it became a foul ball, if it landed in fair territory it became a fair ball. Any ball which became caught in the roof over fair ground was a ground rule double. That has only happened three times in its history – Dave Kingman for the Oakland Athletics on May 4, 1984, University of Minnesota Gophers player George Behr and Corey Koskie in 2004. The speakers, being closer to the playing surface, were hit more frequently, especially the speakers in <b>foul</b> <b>ground</b> near the infield, which were typically hit several times a season, which posed an extra challenge to infielders trying to catch them. However, beginning with the 2005 season, the ground rules for Twins games were changed such that any batted ball that struck a speaker in foul territory would automatically be called a foul ball, {{regardless of whether or}} not it was caught. The dome's roof color made it close to impossible to catch balls without taking the eye off the ball. As a result, fielders frequently lost balls in the roof. An example of this is seen in a home run derby put on by a softball entertainment crew prior to a Twins game. Taken at field level, the balls generally tended to be lost in the roof. The roof was high enough that it has never been a concern for events other than baseball.|$|E
2500|$|For various reasons, Dodger Stadium {{has long}} enjoyed a {{reputation}} as a pitchers' park. At first, the relatively deep outfield dimensions were a factor, with the power alleys being about 380 feet. Home plate was moved 10 feet toward center field in 1969, but that move also expanded <b>foul</b> <b>ground</b> by 10 feet, a tradeoff which helped to offset the increased likelihood of home runs caused by the decreased field dimensions. [...] Also, during evening games, as the sun sets, the surrounding air cools quickly due to the ocean climate, becoming more dense. [...] As a result, deep fly balls that might otherwise be home runs during the day instead often remain in play becoming outs. The park has been home to 12 no-hitters, while players have hit for the cycle just twice in Dodger Stadium.|$|E

50|$|When {{designing}} a bilge keel {{there are important}} decisions to consider. To minimize hydrodynamic drag the bilge keel should be placed in way of a flowline where it does not oppose crossflow. For such a usage {{the ends of the}} bilge keel should be tapered and properly faired into the hull. Also, a bilge keel should not protrude from the hull so far that the device could be damaged when the vessel is alongside a pier, even with a few degrees of adverse heel. Bilge keels on commercial vessels should not protrude below the baseline either, where they could be damaged or <b>fouled</b> by <b>grounding.</b> Note that small bilge keels are often fitted to smaller fishing boats precisely to protect the hull on drying moorings and to help keep the vessel upright.|$|R

60|$|The usual {{track of}} the Sofala both going and {{returning}} on every trip led her for a few miles along this reefinfested region. She followed a broad lane of water, dropping astern, one after another, these crumbs of the earth's crust resembling a squadron of dismasted hulks run in disorder upon a <b>foul</b> <b>ground</b> of rocks and shoals. Some of these fragments of land appeared, indeed, {{no bigger than a}} stranded ship; others, quite flat, lay awash like anchored rafts, like ponderous, black rafts of stone; several, heavily timbered and round at the base, emerged in squat domes of deep green foliage that shuddered darkly all over to the flying touch of cloud shadows driven by the sudden gusts of the squally season. The thunderstorms of the coast broke frequently over that cluster; it turned then shadowy in its whole extent; it turned more dark, and as if more still in the play of fire; as if more impenetrably silent in the peals of thunder; its blurred shapes vanished--dissolving utterly at times in the thick rain--to reappear clear-cut and black in the stormy light against the gray sheet of the cloud--scattered on the slaty round table of the sea.

50|$|Foul {{territory}} also currently varies, {{because there}} is a small amount of <b>foul</b> <b>ground</b> behind home plate.

This was expected to change when the main grandstands are renovated in the 2009-2010 off-season. The bullpens were also located out in the foul territory by the outfield walls.

40|$|Abstract. Railroad ballast is the uniformly-graded {{aggregate}} {{between and}} underneath railroad ties. The purpose of ballast {{is to provide}} support for the heavy loading applied by trains. New ballast contains significant void space between the aggregate. As ballast ages it is progressively fouled by fine-grained material that fills the void space. The structural integrity of seriously fouled ballast can be compromised leading to track instability and ultimately, train derailments. For this reason {{it is very important}} to be able to detect <b>fouled</b> ballast. <b>Ground</b> penetrating radar (GPR) has been used over the past 25 years for ballast evaluation and has yielded mixed results. Traditionally, GPR data have been interpreted with strategies focusing on reflections from layer interfaces. This can be a severe handicap when obtaining data on a ballast structure which contains gradational fouling. GSSI developed a 2 GHz horn antenna in 2003 which was initially tested on ballast at the Transportation Technology Center, Inc. in Pueblo, CO in 2005 and subsequently on Amtrak Rails near Boston, MA in 2006. It was noted that the antenna is much more focused compared to the commonly used 1 GHz horn antenna and provides data that contain significant scattering energy from the void space in clean ballast. The data from fouled ballast contained minimal scattering from the remaining void space. Comparison of the data obtained using the 2 GHz antenna with available ground truth supports this interpretation. This GPR methodology shows potential for routine inspection of working railroads and is especially suited to assess the ballast fouling condition near the bottom of railroad ties...|$|R

A pre-season game in 2006 between Houston and Kansas City had the first half end automatically due to an intentional <b>grounding</b> <b>foul</b> with less than 10 seconds left.

40|$|Ballast fouling {{is created}} by the {{breakdown}} of aggregates or outside contamination by coal dust from coal trains, or from soil intrusion beneath rail track. Due to ballast fouling, the conditions of rail track can be deteriorated considerably {{depending on the type}} of fouling material and the degree of fouling. So far there is no comprehensive guideline available to identify the critical degree of fouling for different types of fouling materials. This paper presents the identification of degree of fouling and types of fouling using non-destructive testing, namely seismic surface-wave and ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey. To understand this, a model rail track with different degree of fouling has been constructed in Civil engineering laboratory, University of Wollongong, Australia. Shear wave velocity obtained from seismic survey has been employed to identify the degree of fouling and types of fouling material. It is found that shear wave velocity of fouled ballast increases initially, reaches optimum fouling point (OFP), and decreases when the fouling increases. The degree of fouling corresponding after which the shear wave velocity of fouled ballast will be smaller than that of clean ballast is called the critical <b>fouling</b> point (CFP). <b>Ground</b> penetrating radar with four different ground coupled antennas (500 MHz, 800 MHz, 1. 6 GHz and 2. 3 GHz) was also used to identify the ballast fouling condition. It is found that the 800 MHz ground coupled antenna gives a better signal in assessing the ballast fouling condition. Seismic survey is relatively slow when compared to GPR survey however it gives quantifiable results. In contrast, GPR survey is faster and better in estimating the depth of fouling.

40|$|GPR {{is widely}} used for ballast fouling identification, however, there are no robust {{guidelines}} to find the degree and type of fouling quantitatively. In this study, GPR {{studies were carried out}} on model and actual railway tracks using three ground coupled antennas and considering three <b>fouling</b> materials. Three <b>ground</b> coupled antennas viz., 100 MHz, 500 MHz and 800 MHz antennas were used for the initial survey and {{it was found that the}} 800 MHz ground coupled antenna is an optimum one to get quality results. Three major fouling materials viz., screened/broken ballast, coal and iron ore were used to construct prototype model sections, which were 1 / 2 of the actual Indian broad-gauge railway track. A separate model section has been created for each degree and type of fouling and GPR surveys were carried out. GPR study shows that increasing the fouling content results in a decrease in the Electromagnetic Wave (EMW) velocity and an increase in the dielectric constant. EMW velocity of ballast fouled with screened ballast was found to be more than coal fouled ballast and iron ore fouled ballast at any degree of fouling and EMW velocity of iron ore fouled ballast was found to be less than coal and screen ballast fouled ballast. Dielectric constant of iron ore fouled ballast was found to be higher than coal and screen ballast fouled ballast for all degrees of fouling. Average slope of the trend line of screen ballast fouled section is low (25. 6 degrees), coal fouled ballast is medium (27. 8 degrees) and iron ore fouled ballast is high (47. 6 degrees).

50|$|With {{the series}} tied at three games apiece, the Cubs sent regular season ERA leader Kyle Hendricks to the mound. The Indians countered with Corey Kluber, winner of Games 1 and 4. Things started {{well for the}} Cubs as Dexter Fowler led off {{the game with a}} home run to {{straight}} away center to give the Cubs an early 1-0 lead. Hendricks held the Indians scoreless until the third when Coco Crisp doubled, was moved to third on a sacrifice bunt by Roberto Pérez, and scored on a single by Carlos Santana. The Cubs jumped back out in front in the fourth when Kris Bryant singled, Anthony Rizzo was hit by a pitch, and Ben Zobrist forced Rizzo at second. Addison Russell hit a shallow fly ball to left field which allowed Bryant to tag and score to put the Cubs up 2-1. Willson Contreras followed the sacrifice fly with a double to right-center field to score Zobrist and the Cubs were up 3-1. The lead increased in the fifth when Javier Báez homered on the first pitch of the inning to drive Kluber from the game. Andrew Miller, who had dominated the postseason, entered the game. Following a single by Fowler, Kyle Schwarber grounded in to a double play and Miller looked to have escaped the inning. But, Bryant coaxed a walk on a nine-pitch at bat and scored from first on a single to right by Rizzo to make the lead 5-1. Hendricks, who had seemingly settled down, got the first two outs {{in the bottom of the}} fifth, but walked Santana. Cub manager Joe Maddon pulled Hendricks to be replaced by Games 1 and 5 starter, Jon Lester. Lester allowed a dribbler in front of the plate by Jason Kipnis, but David Ross, who had entered the game with Lester and was playing in his final major league game, threw wildly to first allowing runners to advance to second and third. Lester uncorked a wild pitch that bounced off Ross's mask and scored both runners, tightening the lead to 5-3. Ross partially atoned for the error in the sixth with a homer to center field to bring the lead to 6-3. Lester allowed runners in the sixth and the seventh, but held the Indians without a run. In the eighth, after retiring the first two batters, Lester allowed a single up the middle to José Ramírez. Maddon had seen enough and brought Aroldis Chapman, pitching in his third straight game, into the contest. Brandon Guyer promptly doubled to score Ramirez and reduce the lead to two. Rajai Davis then stunned the Cubs by homering to left to tie the game at six. In the ninth, Ross walked and was pinch run for by Chris Coghlan. Jason Heyward grounded into a force play, but then stole second and advanced on a bad throw by Yan Gomes. With two strikes, Báez attempted to bunt, but <b>fouled</b> out. Fowler <b>grounded</b> out to end the threat. Surprisingly, Chapman returned to the mound in the ninth and retired the Indians in order to force extra innings.|$|R

60|$|December 6th.--All these days, {{since my}} last date, have {{been marked by}} nothing very well worthy of detail and description. I have walked the streets {{a great deal in}} the dull November days, and always take a certain {{pleasure}} in being in the midst of human life,--as closely encompassed by it as it is possible to be anywhere in this world; and in that way of viewing it there is a dull and sombre enjoyment always to be had in Holborn, Fleet Street, Cheapside, and the other busiest parts of London. It is human life; it is this material world; it is a grim and heavy reality. I have never had the same sense of being surrounded by materialisms and hemmed in with the grossness of this earthly existence anywhere else; these broad, crowded streets are so evidently the veins and arteries of an enormous city. London is evidenced in every one of them, just as a megatherium is in each of its separate bones, even if they be small ones. Thus I never fail of a sort of self-congratulation in finding myself, for instance, passing along Ludgate Hill; but, in spite of this, it is really an ungladdened life to wander through these huge, thronged ways, over a pavement <b>foul</b> with mud, <b>ground</b> into it by a million of footsteps; jostling against people who {{do not seem to be}} individuals, but all one mass, so homogeneous is the street-walking aspect of them; the roar of vehicles pervading me,--wearisome cabs and omnibuses; everywhere the dingy brick edifices heaving themselves up, and shutting out all but a strip of sullen cloud, that serves London for a sky,--in short, a general impression of grime and sordidness; and at this season always a fog scattered along the vista of streets, sometimes so densely as almost to spiritualize the materialism and make the scene resemble the other world of worldly people, gross even in ghostliness. It is strange how little splendor and brilliancy one sees in London,--in the city almost none, though some in the shops of Regent Street. My wife has had a season of indisposition within the last few weeks, so that my rambles have generally been solitary, or with J----- only for a companion. I think my only excursion with my wife was a week ago, when we went to Lincoln's Inn Fields, which truly are almost fields right in the heart of London, and as retired and secluded as if the surrounding city were a forest, and its heavy roar were the wind among the branches. We gained admission into the noble Hall, which is modern, but built in antique style, and stately and beautiful exceedingly. I have forgotten all but the general effect, with its lofty oaken roof, its panelled walls, with the windows high above, and the great arched window at one end full of painted coats of arms, which the light glorifies in passing through them, as if each were the escutcheon of some illustrious personage. Thence we went to the chapel of Lincoln's Inn, where, on entering, we found a class of young choristers receiving instruction from their music-master, while the organ accompanied their strains. These young, clear, fresh, elastic voices are wonderfully beautiful; they are like those of women, yet have something more birdlike and aspiring, more like what one conceives of the singing of angels. As for the singing of saints and blessed spirits that have once been human, it never can resemble that of these young voices; for no duration of heavenly enjoyments will ever quite take the mortal sadness out of it.|$|R

50|$|The {{general layout}} of Memorial Stadium resembled a {{somewhat}} scaled-down version of Cleveland Stadium (then {{home of the}} MLB Indians and NFL Browns). Due {{to the need to}} fit a football field on the premises, the playing area was initially quite large, especially in center field and foul territory. The construction of inner fences after 1958, however, reduced the size of the outfield. The addition of several rows of box seats also reduced the <b>foul</b> <b>ground,</b> ultimately making the stadium much more of a hitters' park than it was originally. It did host the Major League Baseball All-Star Game that year. Memorial Stadium was one of the nation's few venues to host a World Series, an MLB All-Star Game, and an NFL Championship game.|$|E
