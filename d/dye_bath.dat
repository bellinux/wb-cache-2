40|$|Textile {{effluents}} usually contain {{high concentrations}} of inorganics as well as organics, and are therefore difficult to treat. Membrane processes {{can be used for}} many of these wastewaters in the textile industry. Two typical examples are discussed: (1) the use of nanofiltration for the treatment of exhausted <b>dye</b> <b>baths,</b> in view of water recycling, and (2) the use of ultrafiltration for the removal of spin finish from waste water resulting from rinsing of textile fibres. Both applications are in principle feasible, but in practice the process is negatively influenced by membrane fouling. In the first application, fouling is assumed to be caused by (ad) sorption of organic compounds, which has a large influence because of the high concentrations used in textile dyeing. Furthermore, the high salt concentrations result in a decrease of the effective driving force because of the high osmotic pressures obtained for typical <b>dye</b> <b>baths.</b> Experimental results are discussed, and the applicability of nanofiltration is related to the characteristics of the <b>dye</b> <b>baths</b> for different <b>dyeing</b> methods. In the second application, the concentration of organic compounds is relatively low, but because of the hydrophobic nature of the spin finish compounds, a significant effect of membrane fouling is expected. An improvement is suggested by using nanofiltration membranes instead of ultrafiltration membranes. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The biosorption {{potential}} of three fungal waste-biomasses (Acremonium strictum, Acremonium sp. and Penicillium sp.) from pharmaceutical companies was {{compared with that}} of a selected biomass (Cunninghamella elegans), already proven to be very effective in dye biosorption. Among the waste-biomasses, A. strictum was the most efficient (decolorization percentage up to 90 % within 30 min) with regard to three simulated dye baths; nevertheless it was less active than C. elegans which was able to produce a quick and substantial decolorization of all the simulated <b>dye</b> <b>baths</b> (up to 97 % within 30 min). The biomasses of A. strictum and C. elegans were then tested for the treatment of nine real exhausted <b>dye</b> <b>baths.</b> A. strictum was effective at acidic or neutral pH, whereas C. elegans confirmed its high efficiency and versatility towards exhausted <b>dye</b> <b>baths</b> characterised by different classes of dyes (acid, disperse, vat, reactive) and variation in pH and ionic strength.

30|$|The high color {{content of}} dye process {{wastewater}} makes {{the presence of}} these dyes obvious and inhibits photosynthetic aquatic plants and algae by absorption of light, and as a result dye decolorization has been a primary goal of dye wastewater treatment processes (Banat et al. 1996). However, beyond color, {{the presence of these}} dyes in aqueous ecosystems presents serious environmental and health concerns {{as a result of the}} toxicity of the free dyes themselves and their transformation into toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic amines, primarily as result of anaerobic microbial reductive cleavage of the azo bond (Chung and Cerniglia 1992; Weisburger 2002; Asad et al. 2007). In addition to toxicity, textile dye wastewaters have high TOC, high salt content and extremes in pH, with reactive <b>dye</b> <b>baths</b> having high pH and acid <b>dye</b> <b>baths</b> have low pH (Golob et al. 2005).|$|R

50|$|Although {{almost all}} dyeing {{can be done}} in a vat, the term vat dye is used to {{describe}} a chemical class of dyes that are applied to cellulosic fibre (i.e.. cotton) using a redox reaction as described below. Because of the use of caustic soda, and the very high pH of the <b>dye</b> <b>bath</b> in the dyeing process, wool cannot be dyed using vat dyestuffs. Wool is soluble in caustic soda solutions.It is possible to dye wool at room temperatures with indigo (vat blue 1) and other low substantive vat dyes using soda ash as the alkali source with very little strength loss. Vat red 10, vat violet 13 and vat orange 1 can be applied in this manner as well.|$|E

5000|$|The dyeing (a [...] "strange and {{cumbersome}} technique", {{according to}} the opinion of J.B. Donne in 1973) begins with a step invisible in the finished product: The cloth is soaked in a <b>dye</b> <b>bath</b> made from mashed and boiled, or soaked, leaves of the n'gallama tree (Anogeissus leiocarpa). Now yellow, the cloth is sun-dried and then painted with designs using a piece of metal or wood. The paint, carefully and repeatedly applied to outline the intricate motifs, is a special mud, collected from riverbeds and fermented {{for up to a}} year in a clay jar. Thanks to a chemical reaction between the mud and the dyed cloth, the brown color remains after the mud is washed off. Finally, the yellow n'gallama dye is removed from the unpainted parts of the cloth by applying soap or bleach, rendering them white.|$|E
50|$|Firstly, {{the cloth}} must be washed, soaked and beaten {{with a large}} mallet. The hot and liquid wax is scooped from small wajan (wok) heated upon small stove. The batik craftperson {{sometimes}} blow the spout tip of canting to allow the liquid wax to flow smoothly and to avoid clogging, then they draw the line or dot upon the cloth, applying the liquid wax, following the patterns and images that previously had been drawn using pencil. A pattern is then drawn with hot wax called malam using canting. The wax functions as a dye-resist. After this, the cloth is dipped in a <b>dye</b> <b>bath</b> containing the first colour. After the cloth is dry, the wax is removed by scraping or boiling the cloth. This process is repeated {{as many times as}} the number of colours desired. For larger areas of cloth which need to be covered, the wax is applied using a tool called tonyok nemboki/mopoki.|$|E
50|$|Protein-based fibers such as silk, wool, and feathers, {{as well as}} the {{synthetic}} polyamide fiber, nylon, can be dyed with acid dyes. As may be expected from the name, acid dyes are effective at acidic (low) pH, where they form ionic bonds with the fiber. Acid dyes are also relatively safe (some are used as food dyes) and simple to use. Vat dyes, including indigo, are a third class of dyes that are effective on cellulosic fibers and silk. Vat dyes are insoluble in water in their unreduced form, and the vat dye must be chemically reduced before they can be used to color fabric. This is accomplished by heating the dye in a strongly basic solution of sodium hydroxide (lye) or sodium carbonate (caustic potash) containing a reducing agent such as sodium hydrosulfite or thiourea dioxide. The fabric is immersed in the <b>dye</b> <b>bath,</b> and after removal the vat dye oxidizes to its insoluble form, binding with high wash-fastness to the fiber. However, vat dyes, and especially indigo, must be treated after dyeing by 'soaping' to prevent the dye from rubbing (crocking) off. Vat dyes can be used to simultaneously dye the fabric and to remove underlying fiber-reactive dye (i.e., can dye a black cotton fabric yellow) because of the bleaching action of the reducing bath (see below). The extra complexity and safety issues (particularly when using strong bases such as lye) restrict use of vat dyes in tie-dye to experts.|$|E

The results demonstrated that reactive dyes can be easily degraded by reductive processes mediated by zero-valent iron, a fact that induces decolorizations of about 80 %. Sequential photo-Fenton processes permit almost total removal of the residual color with elimination of 90 % of the COD content. The reuse of treated residues permits the achievement of materials that attend practically all textile specifications, with exception of the color difference parameter (&# 916;E), which is unsatisfactory toward the importation standards, but adequate for the national market...|$|R
