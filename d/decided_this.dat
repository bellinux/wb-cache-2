5|$|Russell T Davies {{scrapped}} a {{glass bowl}} storyline for the Partners in Crime slot in Series 4, as he <b>decided</b> <b>this</b> {{would make the}} story too contained, and that wasn't the tone he wanted. In his book The Writer's Tale, Davies remarked that he was glad he abandoned the idea, because The Simpsons Movie had a similar premise.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after leaving}} TSR, Gygax was {{approached}} by a wargaming acquaintance, Forrest Baker, who had done some consulting work for TSR in 1983 and 1984. Gygax, who was tired of company management, was simply looking for some way to market more of his Gord the Rogue novels, but Baker had a vision for a new gaming company. He promised that he would handle the business end, while Gygax would handle the creative projects. Baker also guaranteed that, using Gygax's name, {{he would be able}} to bring in one to two million dollars of investment. Gygax <b>decided</b> <b>this</b> was a good opportunity, and in October 1986, New Infinities Productions, Inc. (NIPI) was publicly announced. To help him with the creative work, Gygax poached Frank Mentzer and Dragon magazine editor Kim Mohan from TSR. But before a single product was released, Forrest Baker left NIPI when his promised outside investment of one to two million dollars failed to materialize.|$|E
5|$|The European Championship was Razer's next—and final—televised tournament, {{for which}} it {{qualified}} as reigning World Champion. It defeated Dutch champions Pulveriser {{to set up a}} semi-final against Tornado. Razer's adversaries attached the anti-crusher frame used in their previous meeting in the series six grand final; the Razer team installed a revised version of the lifting hook. Tornado was the early aggressor, until Razer picked it up with the hook and dragged it towards the pit. The size of Tornado's framework made it difficult for Razer to drop it in, and the strain of lifting Tornado burnt out Razer's drive motors. Razer was immobile {{at the end of the}} match, but the result went to a judges' decision. They awarded victory to Razer for being in control of the fight, but in a split decision the team <b>decided</b> <b>this</b> was unfair and conceded to Tornado, who beat Philliper 2 in the final to claim the European title.|$|E

25|$|In 1812, Guthrie found {{employment}} on a flatboat transporting goods {{down the}} Ohio and Mississippi Rivers to New Orleans, Louisiana. After three such trips, he <b>decided</b> <b>this</b> work was unfulfilling, and, along with Ben Hardin and Charles A. Wickliffe, {{began to study}} law under Judge John Rowan. He {{was admitted to the}} bar in 1817, and commenced practice in Bardstown.|$|E
25|$|While {{the launch}} was successful, ground {{controllers}} lost {{control over the}} USA-193 satellite shortly after it was established on its orbit, and were unable to regain control. The satellite itself posed minimal risk of falling and causing damage. However, the satellite carried hydrazine fuel which is very toxic. In 2008, President George W. Bush <b>decided</b> <b>this</b> risk would be too great and tasked United States Strategic Command to destroy the satellite to preserve human life.|$|E
25|$|The {{flagship}} became {{separated from}} the two junks. The junks arrived in Cambodia {{only to find that}} the Cambodians had already driven out the Siamese. One of the anti-Siamese leaders, Anacaparan, had declared himself king. The Spanish <b>decided</b> <b>this</b> was a favorable opportunity, but they would await the arrival of their flagship before taking action. Nevertheless, an altercation occurred with Chinese traders in port, and the Spanish took up arms against them, killing some. This led to a confrontation with the new king, whom the Spaniards also defeated, burning much of his capital in the process.|$|E

25|$|The impasse {{continued}} {{late into}} the evening. Pakistan captain Inzamam ul-Haq claimed that Darrell Hair did not inform him or {{the rest of his}} side of the reasons why the ball was replaced, and that Hair had implied that Pakistan were cheating. At 19:50 UTC it was finally announced at a press conference that the Test was called off. The ECB's statement said that England were awarded the match by the umpires as Pakistan refused to take the field after being warned that under law 21.3, failure to do so would result in them forfeiting the game. This is the first time a Test match has been <b>decided</b> <b>this</b> way.|$|E
25|$|A second Blenheim, V6000, became {{available}} for additional testing. The team {{began to use}} this aircraft as a testbed for alternate scanning solutions, leaving the original N3522 with the spiral-scan system. One of the first tests was to use a manual scanning system {{in place of the}} spiral or helical systems, allowing the operator to scan the sky using controls on his receiver sets. Once a target was found, they could flip a switch and the system would track that target automatically from that point. After considerable effort, they <b>decided</b> <b>this</b> concept simply didn't work, and that the mechanical scanning systems were a better solution.|$|E
25|$|Teacher {{dissatisfaction with}} {{representation}} {{by the three}} Trinidad unions had grown in the 1970s. There was the view that adversarial relations between the three units had severely hampered Industrial Relations in the Teaching Service. As early as 1966 there was a struggle {{between two of the}} three unions to be the sole representative for any class of, or classes of teachers. The Special Tribunal No. 10 of 1974, which stated that any one of the three unions could represent any class or classes of teachers <b>decided</b> <b>this</b> issue. This resulted in rapid changes of membership among teachers. However, not one of these unions emerged as the majority union.|$|E

25|$|War {{had already}} been unofficially {{declared}} by Philip II of Spain after the Treaty of Nonsuch in which Elizabeth I had offered her support to the rebellious Protestant Dutch rebels. The Queen through Francis Walsingham ordered Sir Francis Drake to lead an expedition to attack the Spanish New World {{in a kind of}} preemptive strike. Sailing from Plymouth, England, he struck first at Santiago in November 1585 then sailed across the Atlantic on New Years Day 1586 to the Spanish New world city of Santo Domingo in the Caribbean, which was captured, plundered, and a 25,000-ducat ransom extorted. Drake, having raided Cartagena harbor a decade before, <b>decided</b> <b>this</b> important place was the next target.|$|E
25|$|Browne was captaining Barbados {{when he got}} {{his first}} call up to the West Indies side in April 1995. He {{struggled}} to hold his place in the side and after 13 Tests he was dropped and didn't return until 3 years later for the ICC Knockout tournament in Kenya. He was soon dropped again, replaced by Ridley Jacobs. His career seemed over but he got a surprise recall for the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy in England. He was the hero in the final, his partnership with Ian Bradshaw saw them home at The Oval. After a year as first choice keeper he <b>decided</b> <b>this</b> time to leave on his own terms, retiring for 'personal reasons'.|$|E
25|$|In September of that year, war again {{broke out}} (the Third War). Catherine and Charles <b>decided</b> <b>this</b> time to ally {{themselves}} with the House of Guise. The Huguenot army was {{under the command of}} Louis I de Bourbon, prince de Condé, and aided by forces from south-eastern France and a contingent of Protestant militias from Germany—including 14,000 mercenary reiters led by the Calvinist Duke of Zweibrücken. After the Duke was killed in action, he was succeeded by the Count of Mansfeld and the Dutch William of Orange and his brothers Louis and Henry. Much of the Huguenots' financing came from Queen Elizabeth I of England. The Catholics were commanded by the Duke d'Anjou (later King Henry III) and assisted by troops from Spain, the Papal States and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.|$|E

25|$|Shakespeare's {{contemporary}} Michael Drayton features fairies in his Nimphidia; {{from these}} stem Alexander Pope's sylphs of The Rape of the Lock, {{and in the}} mid-17th century, précieuses took up the oral tradition of such tales to write fairy tales; Madame d'Aulnoy invented the term contes de fée ("fairy tale"). While the tales told by the précieuses included many fairies, they were less common in other countries' tales; indeed, the Brothers Grimm included fairies in their first edition but <b>decided</b> <b>this</b> was not authentically German and altered the language in later editions, changing each Fee ("fairy") to an enchantress or wise woman. J. R. R. Tolkien described these tales as {{taking place in the}} land of Faerie. Additionally, not all folktales that feature fairies are generally categorized as fairy tales.|$|E

A few weeks before the release of the film, the U.S. and Soviet governments had agreed not to put any nuclear weapons into outer space.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the lack}} of time in filming, no tracks were filmed that were unreleased, but several {{alternative}} shots and outtakes were held in the Archives du Film du Bois D'Arcy near Paris. At some point, an employee of the owners, MHF Productions, <b>decided</b> <b>this</b> footage was of no value and incinerated all 548 cans of the original 35mm negatives. Maben was particularly frustrated about the lack of additional shots for [...] "One of These Days," [...] which is primarily a Mason solo-piece in the released version.

However, the crew <b>decided</b> <b>this</b> was a bad idea, and it was changed to Rainicorn telling Jake that she is pregnant. It was originally planned for the pregnancy reveal to be in Korean, but the crew felt that the meaning of the ending would be lost on most of the audience.|$|E
