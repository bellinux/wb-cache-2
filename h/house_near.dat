Both the UK Inland Revenue and the US Internal Revenue Service sought to tax him as a resident.

5|$|On {{the night}} of May 18–19, a platoon {{departed}} from Ein Gev by sea to Samra and raided the Syrian contingent in Tel al-Qasr.

A second raid, by a Yiftach company, crossed the Jordan and struck the Syrian camp at the Customs <b>House,</b> <b>near</b> the main Bnot Yaakov Bridge. After a short battle, the Syrian defenders (one or two companies) fled. The Palmachniks destroyed the camp and several vehicles, including two armored cars, without losses.|$|E
