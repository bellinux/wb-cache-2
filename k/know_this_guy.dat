500|$|In any case, Biden {{would not}} run {{again for the}} {{presidency}} until his 2008 campaign, twenty years later. This time {{he made it to}} the Iowa caucuses, but withdrew after a poor showing. [...] Meanwhile, Biden and Kinnock had become close friends after the plagiarism incident. Meeting in August 2008, after Biden had been chosen by Democratic nominee Barack Obama as his running mate, Biden introduced Kinnock to his Senate staff by saying: “Hey, you people! Do you <b>know</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy?</b> He used to be my greatest speechwriter.” [...] Obama and Biden proceeded to win the general election against the Republican ticket of John McCain and Sarah Palin; Biden's 1988 campaign lapses were never a significant issue in the race, and Biden invited Kinnock to the inauguration. Additionally, Biden also won the Delaware Senate election the same year, and would've been the longest serving Senator in Delaware history, had the McCain/Palin ticket been elected. In 2015, Biden considered a possible 2016 presidential bid, but declined it on October 21, 2015, the same year his son Beau died of brain cancer. As his term expired in 2017, he is currently considering a possible presidential bid for the 2020 election.|$|E

Just as the film was about to open, Cimino gave an interview to The New York Times in which he claimed that he had been [...] "attached to a Green Beret medical unit" [...] {{at the time of the}} Tet Offensive of 1968.

Cimino's active service - six months while a student at Yale in 1962 - had been as a reservist who was never deployed to Vietnam.

His family moved back to Sri Lanka when Maya was six months old. M.I.A. named her debut album Arular in 2005 after this name, partly for him to get in contact with her. [...] "Arular" [...] was his nom de guerre during the civil war. M.I.A. said of her upbringing: [...] "I only had my mum. I never grew up with my dad so I don’t know what he’s like. I think I’m a mixture of both. My mum’s really passive, quiet and she’s not feisty. She cared about bringing in food and getting us to school and stuff but that’s as far as it went. Growing up without a dad, I was going to school and turning up at parents’ meetings on my own. At the time everyone was like, “Oh if you had a dad he’d pay for your school and you’d have a better future.” At the time, my mom was bringing us up and she was like, “The only thing your father gave you was a name.” So that’s why I used name “Arular” on my album {{to turn it into a}} statement that my mom always made. If the only thing he’s going to give me is a name, then that’s what I’m going to use." [...] In 2005, M.I.A. told EGO Magazine that despite her father's involvement in the conflict, she felt no affiliation to either armed party in the war, noting her work to be the voice of [...] "civilians and refugees that get caught up in the cross fire of politics" [...] and shocking enough to invoke discussion in young people that felt they had no right to talk. Following the end of the armed conflict in 2009, M.I.A. condemned the Government of Sri Lanka for engaging in systematic genocide against Tamils. In a 2010 feature for The Fader, she stated of the US and Sri Lankan government's behaviour towards her following her rise in prominence: [...] "He negotiated peace processes, brought in the new army, and when he goes to Sri Lanka, it’s the government who gives him security against the Tigers,” she explains. “They used it the other way and told the world my dad’s a Tiger which got me to this point. It’s like, ‘Wow I didn’t <b>know</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy,</b> and this guy has been working for you for 20 fucking years, and when you feel like it you want to use my own dad against me to discredit what I do.’” ...|$|E

Eventually, Cuse and Lindelof decided to combine their original idea for the character with Akinnuoye-Agbaje's character on Oz. Originally, the character was named [...] "Emeka", and later [...] "Omecca", but after Akinnuoye-Agbaje was cast, the name was changed to [...] "Eko", in order to be consistent with Akinnuoye-Agbaje's own Nigerian tribal lineage. Eko refers to the City of Legos (Lagos) in Nigeria, coming from Eleko, Lord of Lagos. Adding [...] "Mr." [...] in front of the character's name was also a suggestion made by Akinnuoye-Agbaje. While at first Cuse and Lindelof thought this was [...] "the silliest thing in the world", they changed their minds after repeating the name a few times, realizing there [...] "was something really cool about it". The character first appeared in [...] "Adrift", where he was only shown briefly, knocking down three of the show's main characters with a stick. Akinnuoye-Agbaje was given the stick and told to [...] "knock those three guys out". Akinnuoye-Agbaje felt [...] "there's no better way to make an entrance". The religious scripture on the stick was a suggestion of Akinnuoye-Agbaje.|$|R

And the hardest kind of time is when you really are in tune with the world that you are excluded from. Every minute, every hour, every day. And that’s also a form of-that is the reality. And <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> was escaping it not at all. And that was very poignant, and that became the idea for the character Stiles by Richard Lawson, who gets killed part of the way through, that he didn’t have Playboy centerfolds in his cell. He had real pictures of the real life that he wasn’t part of. And Murphy was an authentic character who starts to have expectations. And if you have expectations, now you’re approaching, your head’s approaching where Lawson is, as his expectations are destroyed, because he can’t race outside. The ending of the film is really kind of a counterpoint. He runs and wins the fastest time, so there’s a triumph, and at one and the same time, he’s lost his soul.Strauss says he [...] "was so impressed" [...] by Mann's script [...] "I asked if he could direct it."

2500|$|In 2002, CSI {{executive}} producer Anthony Zuiker began casting for the then-unnamed Miami based spin-off. First cast was Emily Procter, as Calleigh Duquesne. Regarding {{her decision to}} leave The West Wing and join Miami, Procter stated that [...] "It was like choosing between a boyfriend that {{wants to be with}} you casually or a man that says I love you." [...] She described her character as [...] "a weird girl [...] bright and very nerdy. She wears a lot of boot-cut corduroy pants and turquoise necklaces and looks like a hippie. I just like to pretend I'm Velma in Scooby-Doo." [...] Adam Rodriguez, Rory Cochrane, and Khandi Alexander were cast alongside Procter, completing the supporting ensemble. For the lead, CBS suggested David Caruso. Zuiker, who stated that he had [...] "heard about the NYPD Blue thing," [...] was initially hesitant. Elaborating, Zuiker stated that he [...] "sort of jumped in and said, 'Naw, I don't <b>know</b> about <b>this</b> <b>guy.</b> The show's tough enough to get off the ground and I don't want to walk into any problems." [...] CBS president Les Moonves had announced in January that a Miami spin-off was imminent, yet [...] "It wasn't until we sort of, like, at the eleventh hour, really started to look at our options as to who was going to play Horatio, [...] revisited Caruso. And [...] said, 'Yeah, we'll have him come out for dinner, see what he's about.'" [...] Caruso was later cast as Caine. He was the last pilot cast member to be contracted to series.|$|R
