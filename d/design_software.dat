5|$|Wilsonville {{has often}} had more {{jobs in the}} city than {{residents}} due to its location along Interstate 5. This location {{has led to the}} city becoming headquarters for several major local and national companies, as well as home to facilities of several national companies. Companies with their headquarters in the city include <b>design</b> <b>software</b> maker Mentor Graphics; imaging systems manufacturer FLIR Systems; and shoe retailer Solestruck. G.I. Joe's, a sporting goods and automotive parts retailer was based in Wilsonville until bankruptcy in 2009, as was drugstore chain Thrifty PayLess until it was bought by Rite Aid in 1996, and video rental retailer Movie Gallery and its subsidiary Hollywood Video were as well until bankruptcy in 2010.|$|E

They are used by companies in the machinery, medical, consumer, tool and die, electrical and power sectors, and by suppliers to the aerospace and automotive industries.|$|E
25|$|Dassault Systèmes was {{incorporated}} in 1981 {{but in fact}} started in 1977 with 15 engineers from Avions Marcel Dassault - led by Francis Bernard, aircraft design engineer - who {{were in charge of}} providing support for the aircraft building process. While they were initially supposed to develop a 3D Computer-aided <b>Design</b> <b>software</b> (CATIA, then called CATI) just to help create designs, the engineers broadened the mission's scope to providing help to other industrial sectors.|$|E

The Australian Capital Territory's government invited five specialist balloon manufacturers to submit proposals to construct The Skywhale, but the Bristol-based company Cameron Balloons was the only one to provide a bid.|$|E

25|$|A {{key issue}} in CCBT use is low uptake and {{completion}} rates, {{even when it}} has been clearly made available and explained. CCBT completion rates and treatment efficacy {{have been found in}} some studies to be higher when use of CCBT is supported personally, with supporters not limited only to therapists, than when use is in a self-help form alone. Another approach to improving uptake and completion rate, as well as treatment outcome, is to <b>design</b> <b>software</b> that supports the formation of a strong therapeutic alliance between the user and the technology.|$|E

The first batch of Klimov RD-93 turbofan engines that would power the prototypes was also delivered in 2002. According to a China National Aero-Technology Import & Export Corporation (CATIC) official, the JF-17's low cost is due {{to some of the}} on-board systems having been adapted from those of the Chengdu J-10. The official said, [...] "This transfer of technologytransposing the aircraft systems from the J-10 to the JF-17is what makes the JF-17 so cost-effective". The use of computer-aided <b>design</b> <b>software</b> shortened the design phase of the JF-17.|$|E
