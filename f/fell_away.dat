5|$|Chappell had {{a direct}} {{influence}} on Hughes' successor, Allan Border. Early in his captaincy tenure, Border was struggling with the burdens of the position so the ACB appointed Bob Simpson as team coach to assist. This led to animosity between Chappell and Simpson as Chappell derided {{the need for a}} coach. Simpson responded by writing that the peer influence of older players helping younger players <b>fell</b> <b>away</b> during the era when the Chappell brothers led the team, and he was redressing the problem.|$|E
5|$|During the Enlightenment, {{intellectual}} {{sympathy for}} astrology <b>fell</b> <b>away,</b> {{leaving only a}} popular following supported by cheap almanacs. One English almanac compiler, Richard Saunders, followed {{the spirit of the}} age by printing a derisive Discourse on the Invalidity of Astrology, while in France Pierre Bayle's Dictionnaire of 1697 stated that the subject was puerile. The Anglo-Irish satirist Jonathan Swift ridiculed the Whig political astrologer John Partridge.|$|E
5|$|He {{started his}} {{professional}} football career at Lumezzane and {{played for the}} first team twice before having an unsuccessful trial at Barcelona, and subsequently joining Internazionale in 2007. Inter manager Roberto Mancini brought Balotelli into the first team, but when Mancini left, Balotelli's disciplinary record <b>fell</b> <b>away.</b> He had a strained relationship with new manager José Mourinho and was suspended from Inter's first team in January 2009 {{after a number of}} disciplinary problems.|$|E

60|$|It {{may have}} been the bathing-machines, or the {{gasometer}} beyond the railway station, or the flag above the Royal Hotel. The curtains of the night <b>fell</b> suddenly <b>away</b> from him. The workaday world came knocking at the door.|$|R
5|$|The {{adhesive}} {{surface was}} protected by a light metal case which was released by pulling a safety pin: the case <b>fell</b> <b>away</b> as two hemispheres connected by a sprung hinge. The inside of the case was fitted {{with a number of}} rubber spikes that kept it clear of the glued surface of the grenade. Early models also had a strip of adhesive tape round the neck of the casing.|$|E
5|$|Johnson sought {{nomination}} by the 1868 Democratic National Convention in New York in July 1868. He remained {{very popular}} among Southern whites, and boosted that popularity by issuing, {{just before the}} convention, a pardon ending the possibility of criminal proceedings against any Confederate not already indicted, meaning that only Davis {{and a few others}} still might face trial. On the first ballot, Johnson was second to former Ohio representative George H. Pendleton, who had been his Democratic opponent for vice president in 1864. Johnson's support was mostly from the South, and <b>fell</b> <b>away</b> as the ballots passed. On the 22nd ballot, former New York governor Horatio Seymour was nominated, and the President received only four votes, all from Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|Kartik {{played in}} ten {{first-class}} matches for Middlesex, taking 33 wickets at 22.87. He took his season's innings best of 5/65 and then 2/26 {{in the season}} opener against cross-London rivals Surrey, and then took 3/32 and 4/53 in a hard-fought 47-run win over Kent, {{and a total of}} 6/139 in the next match against Essex, but his season <b>fell</b> <b>away</b> at the end, managing only six wickets in the last three matches. With the bat, he made 336 runs at 24.00, the most prolific season of his career with the willow, including 62 against Essex and 57 not out against Gloucestershire. He played in a solitary one-dayer, taking 2/19 against Northamptonshire.|$|E

50|$|The {{edges of}} the wood were {{gradually}} cleared and <b>felled</b> <b>away</b> in the 16th century and 17th century by farmers. In 1678 Wentwood {{was the scene of}} riots led by Nathan Rogers and Edward Kemys against the actions of the Marquis of Worcester, Henry Somerset, who, as Lord Lieutenant of Monmouthshire and Governor of Chepstow Castle, enclosed some 3000 acres of the forest for his own use, and began to fell trees for use in his ironworks at Tintern. The tenants of the area, including Rogers, claimed that the ancient rights to the forest belonged to them, and rioted when 50 armed men of Worcester's arrived to carry <b>away</b> the <b>felled</b> wood.|$|R
60|$|It {{was amazing}} what effect the monosyllable had upon him. The mask which he carried always with him <b>fell</b> {{suddenly}} <b>away.</b> He turned upon {{her with an}} abruptness almost disconcerting. His eyes were lit with fire, {{and there was a}} strange flush upon his cheeks.|$|R
5|$|The castle {{began to}} decline in importance, however, and in 1369 passed to the Despensers and then the Beauchamps, neither of whom used the castle. It was {{temporarily}} refortified by Henry IV {{in response to the}} Owain Glyndŵr uprising in North Wales in 1403. The Nevilles acquired the property in the 15th century and it remained in the control of the Lords of Abergavenny until the 1970s. After the Black Death the town's population <b>fell</b> <b>away</b> sharply as well, the protected area north of the castle was abandoned, and by the 16th century it was no longer a functioning trading centre.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{was formed}} around a court, later called the inner court, {{enclosed}} by a curtain {{wall with a}} circular tower on each corner and a gatehouse at the front; the north-east tower was larger than the others, perhaps to provide additional defences. Over time the towers acquired their own names: the north-west tower was called the Hazelwell Tower; the north-east the Redcap Tower and the south-west the Lady Tower. The ground <b>fell</b> <b>away</b> sharply on most sides of the castle, but its south and west sides were protected with a wet moat, using a dam fed from a nearby spring using a pipe. The gatehouse had twin towers and a drawbridge.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorial}} {{was unveiled}} on 6 June 1904. This date was significant both as {{the birthday of}} the then Prince of Wales, George V, and the third anniversary of the Battle of Graspan, (in which South Australian soldiers had served). A large crowd gathered to view the unveiling, and the speakers included {{the chair of the}} memorial committee, George Brookman, and George Le Hunte, the Governor of South Australia. The memorial itself was shrouded by canvas and the Union Jack, which <b>fell</b> <b>away</b> to reveal the statue underneath.|$|E

60|$|The {{girl had}} gained {{something}} {{by the change}} from her outdoor attire to the clinging evening dress, but it was with characteristic unconcern that she disregarded {{the fact that the}} thin skirt <b>fell</b> well <b>away</b> from one shapely ankle effectively displayed by a stocking of the finest texture.|$|R
60|$|THE gray stallion, {{finding the}} rein loose on his neck, trotted forward and overtook the dog, and {{thereafter}} followed at his heels. With {{the setting of}} the sun a slight breeze stirred, and freshened as twilight <b>fell,</b> rolling <b>away</b> the sultry atmosphere. Then the black desert night mantled the plain.|$|R
5|$|While they <b>fell</b> <b>away</b> seriously shot about, and {{the rest}} of 60 Squadron exited the scene, Voss was engaged by B Flight, 56 Squadron, in their SE.5as. Captain James McCudden and his wingmen {{attacked}} in pairs from 300meters (1,000feet) above Voss. In a pincer movement, McCudden hooked into an assault from the right while his wingman, Lieutenant Arthur Rhys Davids, swooped in from the left. Muspratt trailed them down, while Cronyn brought up the rear. Jeffs and Young held high as top cover in case Voss climbed. He was now boxed in from above and below, with assailants pouncing from either side. To further worsen Voss's situation, there was a British fighter patrol beneath him.|$|E
5|$|After new {{investment}} at board level Revie {{was able to}} spend £25,000 on Everton's Scotland international Bobby Collins, who he installed as captain. Other arrivals included former Manchester City teammate Billy McAdams, forward Ian Lawson and left-back Cliff Mason. He spent £53,000 to bring John Charles back from Juventus, and though he proved not to {{be as effective as}} during his first spell at Leeds, Revie was able to sell him on to Roma for a £17,000 profit within just a few months. Leeds pushed for promotion in 1962–63, but the harsh winter caused many postponements and a backlog of games {{at the end of the}} season proved too much for Leeds, who <b>fell</b> <b>away</b> to finish in fifth place.|$|E
5|$|John Hick {{published}} Evil and the God of Love in 1966, {{in which}} he developed a theodicy {{based on the work}} of Irenaeus. Hick distinguished between the Augustinian theodicy, based on free will, and the Irenaean theodicy, based on human development. Hick framed his theodicy as an attempt to respond to the problem of evil in light of scientific development, such as Darwin's theory of evolution, and as an alternative to the traditionally accepted Augustinian theodicy. Rejecting the idea that humans were created perfectly and then <b>fell</b> <b>away</b> from perfection, Hick instead argued that humans are still in the process of creation. He interpreted the fall of man, described in the book of Genesis, as a mythological description of the current state of humans.|$|E
60|$|Nasmyth {{admitted}} {{that it was}} pretty indeed, and his concurrence was justified. Sombre pinewoods and rocky heights walled in the wooden dwelling, but {{in front of it}} the ground <b>fell</b> sharply <b>away,</b> and beyond the shadow of the tall crags a blaze of moonlight stretched eastwards athwart the sparkling sea.|$|R
60|$|Their {{favourite}} {{place was}} {{the back of}} the Rock; where the cliff, in many places, <b>fell</b> sheer <b>away</b> for hundreds of feet down into the sea. They had many discussions as to the possibility of climbing up on that side, though both agreed that {{it would be impossible to}} climb down.|$|R

5|$|Kartik {{returned}} to India and took 16 wickets at 32.75 in six matches for Railways in the Ranji Trophy. After taking 5/85 {{in the first}} innings of the season opener against Karnataka, his performances <b>fell</b> <b>away</b> and he managed only four wickets in his last three matches. Nevertheless, he was selected for Central Zone in the Duleep Trophy and took a total of 2/98 as they lost on first innings to South and were eliminated after one match. Kartik made some contributions with the bat, scoring 197 runs at 24.62 for the season, including a score of 56 against Maharashtra and two other efforts of 30. Playing for both Railways and Central, Kartik took 12 wickets at 23.50 in the one-day matches for the season. He also scored 65 runs at 13.00.|$|E
5|$|Maintaining the castles proved challenging, {{and they}} rapidly fell into disrepair. The money {{given to the}} castle constables {{to enable them to}} {{maintain}} and garrison the castles had not been generous to start with, but the sums provided declined considerably during the 14th century. The constable of Conwy Castle had been provided with £190 a year in 1284, but this <b>fell</b> <b>away</b> to £40 a year by the 1390s; Harlech's funding fell similarly from £100 a year to only £20 by 1391. By 1321 a survey reported that Conwy was poorly equipped, with limited stores and suffering from leaking roofs and rotten timbers, and in the 1330s, Edward III was advised that none of the castles were in fit state to host the royal court should he visit the region. A 1343 survey showed that Beaumaris needed extensive work, with several of the towers in a ruinous conditions.|$|E
5|$|Revie had {{improved}} his goal tally to 13 in the 1953–54 season, but only once the Revie Plan was {{implemented in the}} 1954–55 campaign were Manchester City able to fully make use of his abilities. The new tactic opened with a 5–0 defeat to Preston North End, but then Ken Barnes replaced John McTavish at inside-forward and the team clicked. Though the tactic was named after Revie, it had initially been introduced at reserve team level by Johnny Williamson, though Revie's superior passing talents meant Williamson was overlooked for the position at first team level. City's league title campaign <b>fell</b> <b>away</b> but {{they went on to}} reach the 1955 FA Cup Final at Wembley, where they were beaten 3–1 by Newcastle United; a first-half injury to Jimmy Meadows left City down to ten men and unable to compete effectively. At {{the end of the season}} Revie was named as FWA Footballer of the Year.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{the hills}} <b>fell</b> sharply <b>away,</b> {{and they were}} at the {{entrance}} of the valley of the Rivière de Noir, which is the principal arm of the Big Wind River at this point. The firing had very much died out during the last few minutes, and only an occasional shot was heard.|$|R
2500|$|Washington was not hit {{during the}} battle; the nearest shells <b>fell</b> [...] <b>away.</b> She fired {{a total of}} 117 16-inch and 522 five-inch shells. South Dakota steamed for the Brooklyn, New York Navy Yard for two months of repairs and refitting. Kirishima capsized and sank at 3:53 AM; the {{destroyer}} [...] was scuttled around 3:25.|$|R
25|$|Steel <b>Fell</b> stands <b>away</b> {{from the}} main spine of the Central Fells, forming {{the end of one}} of the many east ridges of High Raise. Intermediate between the two are Codale Head and Calf Crag. Steel Fell is bordered by Wythburndale to the north and the valley of Green Burn to the south-west. The eastern face looks down on Dunmail Raise.|$|R
5|$|Temeraires one {{brush with}} the French {{during this period}} came on 13 August 1811. Having {{received}} orders to sail to Menorca, Spear attempted to tack out of Hyères Bay. As {{he tried to do}} so, the wind <b>fell</b> <b>away,</b> leaving Temeraire becalmed and caught in a current which caused her to drift towards land. She came under fire from a shore battery on Pointe des Medes, which wounded several of her crew. Her boats were quickly manned, and together with boats sent from the squadron, Temeraire was towed out of range of the French guns. She then sailed to Menorca and underwent repairs. During this period an epidemic of yellow fever broke out, infecting nearly the entire crew and killing around a hundred crewmen. Pellew ordered her back to Britain, and health gradually improved as she sailed through the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{chose to}} bat first, and Brown top scored with 140, his first 50 taking three hours. He shared century stands with Bradman, who made 62, and Miller (57). Loxton later made 51 as the Australians <b>fell</b> <b>away</b> {{late in the}} innings, losing 7/142. Derbyshire made 240 in their first innings with the future Test umpire Charlie Elliott top-scoring with 57, while Miller, Johnston and Ring taking three wicket apiece. The county {{followed}} on 216 behind after losing their last six wickets for 64 runs. In their second innings they made 182, with Denis Smith making 88, the highest individual score ever made by a Derbyshire player against the Australians. However, only one other player reached double figures, as McCool precipitated a collapse of 9/72, taking 6/77, while Loxton took 3/16. There was a Derbyshire record attendance of 17,000 on the first day.|$|E
5|$|The hot {{and humid}} {{conditions}} in Nanning slowed the runners' pace and twelve of them remained within the main pack by the 10km point. The following five kilometres was decisive for the race, as Samuel Tsegay, Titus Masai and Mosop were all left trailing. The leading four runners were soon reduced to three, as Kipruto <b>fell</b> <b>away</b> to leave Zersenay Tadese, Wilson Kiprop and Sammy Kitwara to battle for the medal positions. Zersenay and Kiprop were neck and neck in the lead from the last kilometre and it was Kiprop who pulled away in the final 100metres to break the Eritrean's four-year undefeated streak. Zersenay faded badly {{at the end and}} appeared injured after taking second place. Kitwara and Kipruto were third and fourth, sealing the Kenyan team victory, while Samuel Tsegay's fifth place helped Eritrea to the team silver.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look out, Frank! rein up!" [...] Dick {{suddenly}} shouted.

5000|$|In June 2008, Sutil {{moved to}} SD Eibar in Segunda División. His debut as a {{professional}} took place on 3 September, starting in a 0-1 defeat at CD Castellón for {{the second round of}} the Copa del Rey; ten days later he played his first league game, coming on as a half-time substitute for Josu Etxaniz as the team <b>fell</b> 0-2 <b>away</b> to SD Huesca.|$|R
60|$|The {{third of}} October had broken auspiciously {{with a bright}} sun and a {{cloudless}} sky.
