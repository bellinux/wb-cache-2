5|$|The family Bovidae {{is placed}} in the order Artiodactyla (which {{includes}} the <b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulates).</b> It includes 143 extant species, accounting for nearly 55% of the ungulates, and 300 known extinct species.|$|E
5|$|River {{dolphins}} {{are members}} of the infraorder Cetacea, which are descendants of land-dwelling mammals of the order Artiodactyla (<b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulates).</b> They are related to the Indohyus, an extinct chevrotain-like ungulate, from which they split approximately 48 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The <b>even-toed</b> <b>{{ungulates}}</b> are ungulates whose {{weight is}} borne about equally {{by the third}} and fourth toes, rather than mostly or entirely by the third as in perissodactyls. There are about 220 artiodactyl species worldwide, including many that are of great economic importance.|$|E

5|$|Bats are placental mammals. They were {{formerly}} grouped in the superorder Archonta, {{along with}} the treeshrews (Scandentia), colugos (Dermoptera), and the primates, because of the apparent similarities between Megachiroptera and such mammals. Genetic evidence places bats in the superorder Laurasiatheria, with its sister taxon as Fereuungulata, which includes carnivorans, pangolins, odd-toed ungulates, <b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulates,</b> and cetaceans. One study places Chiroptera as a sister taxon to odd-toed ungulates (Perissodactyla).|$|E
5|$|Current {{research}} indicates that mammals did not explosively diversify across the K–Pg boundary, despite the environment niches made available by the extinction of dinosaurs. Several mammalian orders have been interpreted as diversifying immediately after the K–Pg boundary, including Chiroptera (bats) and Cetartiodactyla (a diverse group that today includes whales and dolphins and <b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulates),</b> although recent research concludes that only marsupial orders diversified after the K–Pg boundary.|$|E
5|$|The {{hippopotamus}} is {{the type}} genus of the family Hippopotamidae. The pygmy hippopotamus belongs to a different genus in Hippopotamidae, either Choeropsis or Hexaprotodon. Hippopotamidae are sometimes known as hippopotamids. Sometimes, the subfamily Hippopotaminae is used. Further, some taxonomists group hippopotamuses and anthracotheres in the superfamily Anthracotheroidea. Hippopotamidae are classified along with other <b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulates</b> in the order Artiodactyla. Other artiodactyls include camels, cattle, deer and pigs, although hippopotamuses are not closely related to these groups.|$|E

5|$|Baleen whales (systematic name Mysticeti), known earlier as {{whalebone}} whales, form a parvorder of the infraorder Cetacea (whales, dolphins and porpoises). They are {{a widely}} distributed and diverse parvorder of carnivorous marine mammals. Mysticeti comprise the families Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (the gray whale). There are currently 15 species of baleen whale. While cetaceans were historically {{thought to have}} descended from mesonychids, molecular evidence supports them as relatives of <b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulates</b> (Artiodactyla). Baleen whales split from toothed whales (Odontoceti) around 34 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Horses are {{odd-toed}} ungulates, {{or members}} of the order Perissodactyla. This order also includes the extant species of rhinos and tapirs, and many extinct families and species. Members of this order walk on either one toe (like horses) or three toes (like rhinos and tapirs). This {{is in contrast to}} <b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulates,</b> members of the order Artiodactyla, which walk on cloven hooves, or two toes. This order includes many species associated with livestock, such as sheep, goats, pigs, cows and camels, as well as species of giraffes, antelopes and deer.|$|E
5|$|River {{dolphins}} {{are a very}} widespread {{group of}} fully aquatic mammals that reside exclusively in freshwater or brackish water. They are an informal grouping of dolphins, which is a paraphyletic group within the infraorder Cetacea. The river dolphins comprise the extant families Platanistidae (the Indian dolphins), Iniidae (the Amazonian dolphins), and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins). There are five extant species of river dolphins, and two subspecies. River dolphins, alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla, with <b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulates,</b> and their closest living relatives the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago.|$|E

50|$|The black {{musk deer}} or dusky musk deer (Moschus fuscus) is {{a species of}} <b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulate</b> in the family Moschidae. It is found in Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, and Nepal.|$|R
5|$|Porpoises are a {{group of}} fully aquatic marine mammals that are {{sometimes}} referred to as mereswine, all of which are classified under the family Phocoenidae, parvorder Odontoceti (toothed whales). There are six extant species of porpoise. They are small toothed whales that are very closely related to oceanic dolphins. The most obvious visible {{difference between the two groups}} is that porpoises have shorter beaks and flattened, spade-shaped teeth distinct from the conical teeth of dolphins. Porpoises, and other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with <b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulates,</b> and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged from them about 40 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{sperm whale}} {{belongs to the}} order Cetartiodactyla, the order {{containing}} all cetaceans and <b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulates.</b> It {{is a member of}} the unranked clade Cetacea, with all the whales, dolphins, and porpoises, and further classified into Odontoceti, containing all the toothed whales and dolphins. It is the sole extant species of its genus, Physeter, in the family Physeteridae. Two species of the related extant genus Kogia, the pygmy sperm whale Kogia breviceps and the dwarf sperm whale K. simus, are placed either in this family or in the family Kogiidae. In some taxonomic schemes the families Kogiidae and Physeteridae are combined as the superfamily Physeteroidea (see the separate entry on the sperm whale family).|$|E
5|$|Whales are {{a widely}} {{distributed}} and {{diverse group of}} fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla with <b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulates</b> and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), {{are thought to have}} split apart around 34 million years ago. The whales comprise eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales).|$|E
50|$|The red {{hartebeest}} (Alcelaphus buselaphus caama or A. caama) is {{a species}} of <b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulate</b> in the family Bovidae found in Southern Africa. More than 130,000 individuals live in the wild. The red hartebeest {{is closely related to}} the tsessebe and the topi.|$|R
50|$|The Japanese serow (Capricornis crispus) is a Japanese goat-antelope, an <b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulate</b> mammal. It {{is found}} in dense {{woodland}} in Japan, primarily in northern and central Honshu. The animal {{is seen as a}} national symbol of Japan and is subject to protection in conservation areas.|$|R
5000|$|The word [...] "tahr" [...] {{comes from}} the Nepali {{language}} and was first used in English writing in 1835. Tahrs belong to the order Artiodactyla, which denotes an <b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulate</b> mammal. Close relatives to the Himalayan tahr also associated to the Caprinae subfamily include sheep and goats.|$|R
5|$|Whales are {{descendants}} of land-dwelling mammals of the artiodactyl order (<b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulates).</b> They {{are related to}} the Indohyus, an extinct chevrotain-like ungulate, from which they split approximately 48 million years ago. Primitive cetaceans, or archaeocetes, first took to the sea approximately 49 million years ago and became fully aquatic 5–10 million years later. What defines an archaeocete is the presence of anatomical features exclusive to cetaceans, alongside other primitive features not found in modern cetaceans, such as visible legs or asymmetrical teeth. Their features became adapted for living in the marine environment. Major anatomical changes included their hearing set-up that channeled vibrations from the jaw to the earbone (Ambulocetus 49 mya), a streamlined body and the growth of flukes on the tail (Protocetus 43 mya), the migration of the nostrils toward the top of the cranium (blowholes), and the modification of the forelimbs into flippers (Basilosaurus 35 mya), and the shrinking and eventual disappearance of the hind limbs (the first odontocetes and mysticetes 34 mya).|$|E
25|$|Perissodactyla (odd-toed ungulates) {{are closer}} to Carnivora and bats than to Artiodactyla (<b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulates).</b>|$|E
25|$|Dolphins are {{descendants}} of land-dwelling mammals of the artiodactyl order (<b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulates).</b> They {{are related to}} the Indohyus, an extinct chevrotain-like ungulate, from which they split approximately 48 million years ago.|$|E
50|$|The {{red goral}} (Naemorhedus baileyi) is {{a species of}} <b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulate</b> in the {{subfamily}} Caprinae in the family Bovidae. It is found in India, Tibet and Myanmar.

50|$|The Java mouse-deer (Tragulus javanicus) is {{a species}} of <b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulate</b> in the family Tragulidae. When it reaches {{maturity}} {{it is about the}} size of a rabbit, making it one of the smallest ungulates. It is found in forests in Java and perhaps Bali, although sightings there have not been verified.|$|R
50|$|The greater mouse-deer, greater Malay chevrotain or napu (Tragulus napu) is {{a species}} of <b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulate</b> in the family Tragulidae. It is found in Sumatra, Borneo and smaller Malaysian and Indonesian islands, and in {{southern}} Myanmar, southern Thailand and peninsular Malaysia. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest.|$|R
25|$|Toothed whales, {{as well as}} baleen whales, are {{descendants}} of land-dwelling mammals of the artiodactyl order (<b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulates).</b> They {{are closely related to}} the hippopotamus, sharing a common ancestor that lived around 54 million years ago (mya).|$|E
25|$|Dolphins are {{a widely}} {{distributed}} and {{diverse group of}} aquatic mammals. They are an informal grouping within the order Cetacea, excluding whales and porpoises, so to zoologists the grouping is paraphyletic. The dolphins comprise the extant families Delphinidae (the oceanic dolphins), Platanistidae (the Indian river dolphins), Iniidae (the new world river dolphins), and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins), and the extinct Lipotidae (baiji or Chinese river dolphin). There are 40 extant species of dolphins. Dolphins, alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with <b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulates.</b> Cetaceans' closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|Rinderpest (also cattle plague or steppe murrain) was an {{infectious}} viral disease of cattle, domestic buffalo, {{and some other}} species of <b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulates,</b> including buffaloes, large antelope and deer, giraffes, wildebeests, and warthogs. The disease was characterized by fever, oral erosions, diarrhea, lymphoid necrosis, and high mortality. Death rates during outbreaks were usually extremely high, approaching 100% in immunologically naïve populations. Rinderpest was mainly transmitted by direct contact and by drinking contaminated water, although {{it could also be}} transmitted by air. After a global eradication campaign, the last confirmed case of rinderpest was diagnosed in 2001.|$|E
50|$|The Javan warty pig or Javan pig (Sus verrucosus) is {{a species}} of <b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulate</b> in the family Suidae. It was {{originally}} endemic to the Indonesian islands Java, Bawean, and Madura, but has recently been found extinct in Madura. Sus verrucosus lives in fragmented teak forest regions ranging in altitudes from sea level to 800 m above sea level.|$|R
50|$|The semiaquatic {{hippopotamus}} (Hippopotamus amphibius) is {{the heaviest}} living <b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulate,</b> mean adult weight is around 1,500 kg (3,300 lb) and 1,300 kg (2,900 lb) {{for males and}} females respectively. It and the critically endangered pygmy hippo (Choeropsis liberiensis) are believed to be the closest extant relatives of cetaceans. Hippos are among the megafaunal species most dangerous to humans.|$|R
5000|$|An {{antelope}} is {{a member}} of a number of <b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulate</b> species indigenous to various regions in Africa and Eurasia. Antelopes comprise a wastebasket taxon (miscellaneous group) within the family Bovidae, encompassing those Old World species that are not cattle, sheep, buffalo, bison, or goats; even so, antelope are generally more deer-like than other bovids. A group of antelope is called a herd.|$|R
