40|$|Final <b>focus</b> <b>magnet</b> {{stabilisation}} is {{an important}} issue when working with nanometre size beams. The present study focuses on mechanical stabilisation. As a first step, the case of a 1 m free-fixed aluminium beam placed on a table with active stabilisation has been studied. This work describes three aspects, namely, sensors and actuators to measure and compensate ground motion, mechanical simulations and a feedback loop. Measurements done with low frequency velocity sensors (down to 0. 1 Hz) in our Annecy lab during office hours show that the displacement RMS on the active table is 1 nm at 4 Hz compared to 10 nm without active stabilisation. Simulations of the dynamic response of the beam have been compared to measurements done with accelerometers placed on the clamping and on the free end of the aluminium beam. The results are in good agreement. We are therefore able to predict by simulation the response of a structure subjected to an external excitation. A first sketch of a feedback loop to compensate specific vibrations has also been developed and allows the simultaneous elimination of several resonance peaks on a reduced-size mock-up.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the HERA Luminosity Upgrade Project it is foreseen to move the final focus quadrupole magnets of the proton machine 16 m closer to the interac-tion region. As the electrons must not be affected by these magnets, the beam pipes for electrons and protons have to be well separated at these magnets. This implies rather sharp bends with bending radii down to 360 m for the elec-tron orbit in the interaction region. At an electron energy of 30 GeV and a beam current of 58 mA these bends cause a high level of synchrotron radiation. The synchrotron radia-tion will be guided through the interaction region and will be absorbed far downstream at low power densities. How-ever, it is unavoidable to stop parts of the synchrotron radi-ation beam at high linear power densities of up to 2 kW/cm rather close to the interaction point where the electron and proton vacuum systems are separated. In order to protect the proton final <b>focus</b> <b>magnet</b> and the septum beam pipe from this synchrotron radiation, a high power synchrotron radiation absorber was designed.

Drift compression and beam combining prior to focusing result in {approx} 100 individual ion beams with line-charge densities of order 10 {sup - 5 } C/m. A focusing {{force is applied}} to the individual ion beams outside of the chamber. For neutralized ballistic chamber transport (NBT), these beams enter the chamber with a large radius (relative to the target spot size) and must overlap inside the chamber at small radius (roughly 3 -mm radius) prior to striking the target. The physics of NBT, in particular the feasibility of achieving the required small spot size, is being examined in the Neutralized Transport Experiment (NTX) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Interpreted by detailed particle-in-cell simulations of beam neutralization, experimental results are being used to validate theoretical and simulation models for driver scale beam transport.
