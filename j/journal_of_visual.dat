2500|$|Throughout his career, Grossman has {{employed}} an airbrush (he favors {{compressed air}} over piston) {{in order to}} render the sculptural forms which are his paintings' most readily identified characteristic. Since with an airbrush a skilled user may lay in areas of shadow and light with either crisp or soft edges, the shapes possess {{a high degree of}} visual verisimilitude. Grossman is sometimes credited with spearheading a resurgence of the tool in illustration; for decades it had been used primarily for photo retouching. Pete Hamill writing in the international <b>journal</b> <b>of</b> <b>visual</b> communication Graphis and Steven Heller in Innovators of American Illustration note that Grossman's approach to the airbrush has been widely imitated. His [...] "mordant wit" [...] is never duplicated, adds Heller.|$|E
