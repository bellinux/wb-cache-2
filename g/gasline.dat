Most of this gas is exported to Japan through a liquefied natural gas terminal located on the Cook Inlet. The Cook Inlet basin contains large oil and gas deposits including several offshore fields. [...] As of 2005 there were 16 platforms in Cook Inlet, the oldest of which is the XTO A platform first installed by Shell in 1964, and newest of which is the Kitchen Lights Unit platform installed by Crowley and supported by the German engineering and project management companies Heavylift@Sea,Overdick and Projektbox installed in 2015. Most of the platforms are operated by Union Oil which was acquired by Chevron in 2005. There are also numerous oil and gas pipelines running around and under the Cook Inlet. The main destinations of the gas pipelines are to Kenai where the gas is primarily used to fuel commercial fertilizer production and a liquified natural gas (LNG) plant and to Anchorage where the gas is consumed largely for domestic uses.ConocoPhillips and Marathon operate the LNG terminal under a series of two-year-long licenses issued by the U.S. Department of Energy under Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act. When these companies applied for another two-year extension of the license, various Alaskan entities, including the local fertizer plant opposed the application on the grounds that there was not sufficient gas to meet local requirements as well as the proposed exports. The Agrium fertilizer plant claimed it closed because it could not obtain a gas supply. On June 3, 2008, the Department of Energy granted the extension having found that there were sufficient supplies for Alaska's needs.On 22 July 2014, the Alaska LNG project submitted an application to export LNG to the US Department of Energy (DOE). ExxonMobil has confirmed that the Alaska LNG project will seek to export up to 20 million tpa of LNG. The project will export LNG for a period of 30 years to countries that have existing free trade agreements (FTA) with the US, as well as to non-FTA countries. The project is anticipated to create up to 15,000 jobs during construction and approximately 1000 jobs for operation of the project.

A small survey trench was opened, that allowed to document a complex stratigraphic sequence. Subsequently an area excavation was developed, ranging 200 sq. meters.

An Early Neolithic context follows, consisting of a bonfire and a second structure with firing remains.

40|$|Analysis {{of a large}} {{data set}} of {{pediatric}} blood lead levels collected in New York City (1970 - 1976) shows a highly significant association between geometric mean blood lead levels {{and the amount of}} lead present in <b>gasline</b> sold during the same period. This association was observed for all age and ethnic groups studied, and it suggests that possible exposure pathways other than ambient air should be considered. Even without detailed knowledge of the exact exposure pathways, suffcient information now exists for policy analysis and dedsions relevant to controls and standards related to lead in gasoline and its effect on subsets of the population. Blood lead levels provide a measure of human lead exposure resulting from all environmental sources. The quantification of relations between environmental exposure and blood lead levels, especially in children, is of considerable importance for assessing the relative contributions of various sources of environmental lead and for judging the adequacy of control measures (1 - 3). The present report is part of a research program exploring several large data sets of pediatric blood lead levels collected by local lead poisoning screening programs. We have previously reported (4) on the analysis of venous blood lead levels of 178, 533 New York City children screened for the first time during 1970 - 1976. This investigation revealed a significant relationship between geometric mean (GM) blood lead levels and ambient air lead measurements obtained from a single sampling station in Manhattan. We now expand upon and refine these findings by considering another possible indicator of lead exposure: lead in gasoline. The protocol for analysis of the New York City data base was to study relatively homogeneous subpopulations defined according to ethnic group, age, and quarterly sampling date.
