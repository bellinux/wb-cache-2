5|$|Soon after D-Day in 1944, Rainbow {{transferred}} to the Foreign Office to head {{a section of the}} secretariat of the European Advisory Commission (EAC) at Norfolk House, making arrangements for the post-war administration of Germany. In June 1945, she moved to Berlin as part of the Allied Control Council. For a time, she slept with a revolver under <b>her</b> <b>pillow</b> during the turbulent times just after the Battle of Berlin. After the Second World War, Allied-occupied Germany was divided into four zones, managed by the British, American, French and Russians. Berlin was also divided into four zones, and Rainbow worked as the UK secretary in the Economic Directorate alongside counterparts from France, America and Russia to co-ordinate administering the districts and supplying food to the population.|$|E
5|$|Back at Kiamo Ko, Elphaba {{has already}} {{captured}} Dorothy, refusing to release {{her until she}} relinquishes Nessarose's slippers â€“ the only things left of her dead sister. Glinda travels to Elphaba's castle to warn her of the danger and persuade her to let Dorothy go. Elphaba refuses until she suddenly receives a letter saying that Fiyero has died. The two women forgive each other for all grievances, acknowledging they have both made mistakes. To help her in her future, Elphaba gives the Grimmerie to Glinda. The two friends embrace {{for the last time}} before saying goodbye forever, and acknowledge that they are who they are because of each other ("For Good"). As the mob arrives at the castle, Elphaba tells Glinda to hide, and she watches from the shadows as Dorothy throws a bucket of water on Elphaba, who appears to melt away. Grief-stricken, Glinda sees that all that remains of her friend is her black hat and the small bottle of green elixir which she had slept with under <b>her</b> <b>pillow.</b>|$|E
25|$|When her lodgings {{had been}} searched, a potion, {{believed}} to be magical, was discovered under <b>her</b> <b>pillow.</b>|$|E
60|$|Anne cowered {{deeper into}} <b>her</b> <b>pillows</b> as if desirous of hiding herself forever from mortal eyes.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Small told Aunt Ann at once, who, {{smiling as}} she lay back on <b>her</b> <b>pillows,</b> said in <b>her</b> distinct, {{trembling}} old voice: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A most {{appropriate}} day for three lone women {{to start off}} on a wild-goose chase after health and pleasure,' groaned Lavinia from among <b>her</b> <b>pillows.</b>|$|R
25|$|In Sweden {{the novel}} was only printed once, {{which makes it}} rather rare. In the Swedish translation, by Lena Torndahl, the whole {{sequence}} involving Christine finding a gigantic spider on <b>her</b> <b>pillow</b> and begs Erik to kill it (Whom during the whole novel compared himself with a spider) has been cut.|$|E
25|$|Annie {{slept with}} a small {{revolver}} under <b>her</b> <b>pillow</b> and a watchdog outside. Three months after landing in Karachi, in August 1910, Annie was stabbed to death in her bed while her two youngest children lay alongside. Two nephews and a third person were charged with murder but were acquitted {{because of lack of}} identification.|$|E
500|$|As the Erskines' {{marriage}} trouble increased, Lady Grange's behaviour {{became increasingly}} unpredictable. In 1730, the factorship of the Preston estate {{was removed from}} her, further increasing her angst. Her discovery of an affair her husband was conducting with coffeehouse owner Fanny Lindsay can only have made matters worse. In April of that year, she threatened suicide and to run naked {{through the streets of}} Edinburgh. She may have kept a razor under <b>her</b> <b>pillow</b> and attempted to intimidate her husband by reminding him whose daughter she was. On 27 July, she signed a formal letter of separation from James Erskine but things did not improve. For example, she [...] her husband in the street and in church and he and one of their children were forced to hide from her in a tavern for two hours or more on one occasion. She intercepted one of his letters and took it to the authorities alleging it was evidence of treason. She is also said to have stood outside the house in Niddry's Wynd, waving the letter and shouting obscenities on at least two occasions. In January 1732 she booked a stagecoach to London and James Erskine and his friends, afraid her presence there would cause them further trouble, {{decided it was time to}} take decisive action.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know how}} to trust you to your own silly devices,' said he, laying her down, and {{lingering}} to settle <b>her</b> <b>pillows</b> and shawls.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is she gone?" [...] said George, in a whisper, {{which he}} meant should be unheard by his wife, who had sunk {{her face in}} <b>her</b> <b>pillows</b> again.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Ercott {{fell back}} on <b>her</b> <b>pillows.</b> In <b>her</b> heart there was just that little soreness natural to a woman over fifty, whose husband has a niece.|$|R
2500|$|Foxie - Lola's stuffed fox, {{it is her}} favourite. In {{a longing}} search for her dear lost toy, she later comes {{to find out that}} she left it under <b>her</b> <b>pillow</b> in the episode [...] "But Where Completely Are We".|$|E
2500|$|Byington spoke some Spanish, {{which she}} learned {{during the time}} spent {{with her husband in}} Buenos Aires; and she studied Brazilian Portuguese in her golden years. In July 1958, she confided to {{reporter}} Hazel Johnson that she had acquired a [...] "small coffee plantation" [...] in Brazil the month before and was learning Portuguese. [...] "Miss Byington explained that she first listens to a 'conditioning record' before she goes to sleep. An hour later, her Portuguese lessons automatically begin feeding into <b>her</b> <b>pillow</b> by means of a small speaker." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meitner's {{earliest}} research {{began at}} age 8, when {{she kept a}} notebook of her records underneath <b>her</b> <b>pillow.</b> She was particularly drawn to math and science, and first studied colors of an oil slick, thin films, and reflected light. Women {{were not allowed to}} attend public institutions of higher education in Vienna around 1900, but Meitner was able to achieve a private education in physics in part because of her supportive parents, and she completed in 1901 with an [...] "externe Matura" [...] examination at the Akademisches Gymnasium.|$|E
60|$|At length I {{could bear}} myself no longer, and {{standing}} beside her bed, asked if I might read it. Until that moment we had {{neither of us}} even referred to the subject. Propped up on <b>her</b> <b>pillows,</b> <b>her</b> long face looking a strange colour against their whiteness, she considered my request.|$|R
60|$|And that {{afternoon}} Sue {{came to the}} bed where Johnsy lay, contentedly knitting a very blue and very useless woolen shoulder scarf, and put one arm around <b>her,</b> <b>pillows</b> and all.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Linley laid {{herself back}} on <b>her</b> <b>pillows</b> and burst out laughing. [...] "Black as thunder? Poor little Sydney, what a ridiculous {{description}} of her! I beg your pardon, mamma; don't be offended." ...|$|R
60|$|Somewhat reassured, Emmeline settled {{herself back}} on <b>her</b> <b>pillow.</b>|$|E
60|$|And {{the poor}} young Queen {{turned her face}} in to <b>her</b> <b>pillow,</b> and wept.|$|E
60|$|Jane made a {{movement}} {{as if she}} were tossing her head on <b>her</b> <b>pillow.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The woman, never {{prepared}} for a climax, rose from <b>her</b> <b>pillows.</b> [...] "Take rooms at the Archangel! leave you unchaperoned!" [...] she cried in blunt dismay. [...] "Why, Isabel Doan, {{what are you thinking}} of?" ...|$|R
60|$|Ruby {{sank back}} on <b>her</b> <b>pillows</b> and sobbed convulsively. Anne pressed {{her hand in}} an agony of sympathy--silent sympathy, which perhaps helped Ruby more than broken, {{imperfect}} words could have done; for presently she grew calmer and her sobs ceased.|$|R
60|$|Miss Corona {{turned over}} on <b>her</b> <b>pillows,</b> lifted {{one corner of}} the white window-blind and peeped out. Below her a river of early {{sunshine}} was flowing through the garden, and the far-away slopes were translucent green in their splendour of young day, with gauzy, uncertain mists lingering, spiritlike, in their intervales. A bird, his sleek plumage iridescent in the sunlight, was perched on the big chestnut bough that ran squarely across the window, singing as if his heart would burst with melody and the joy of his tiny life. No bride could have wished anything fairer for her day of days, and Miss Corona dropped back on <b>her</b> <b>pillows</b> with another gentle sigh.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Mavering {{dropped back}} on <b>her</b> <b>pillow,</b> {{and her husband}} smiled patiently at their daughter.|$|E
60|$|Ellen's {{face looked}} almost ugly in its {{lowering}} resolution. Upstairs Rosemary was crying into <b>her</b> <b>pillow.</b>|$|E
60|$|When {{the woman}} {{came in with}} the breakfast she found Fan lying sobbing on <b>her</b> <b>pillow.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "A husband!" [...] Anne {{had been}} sitting up in bed, the better to wrestle {{with the problem of}} her exact opinion of Billy Andrews. Now she fell flatly back on <b>her</b> <b>pillows,</b> the very breath gone out of her. [...] "Whose husband?" ...|$|R
60|$|John entered. Propped {{very high}} on <b>her</b> <b>pillows,</b> in perfect regularity, his mother lay. Her carved face was surmounted by {{a piece of}} fine lace, her thin, white fingers on the {{turnover}} of the sheet moved in continual interlocking, her lips smiled.|$|R
50|$|The next day, the ogress set him {{to spread}} the {{feathers}} from <b>her</b> <b>pillows</b> to dry them and put them all back. He spread them out, a breeze carried them off, and he called on Tritill, Litill, and the birds. They put the feathers back.|$|R
60|$|Thereupon Mrs. Dalloway {{turned to}} the cool side of <b>her</b> <b>pillow,</b> terribly {{flattened}} but still invincible.|$|E
60|$|At four oâ€™clock in the {{afternoon}} Patsy rubbed her eyes, yawned and raised her head from <b>her</b> <b>pillow.</b>|$|E
60|$|With {{these words}} {{the queen and}} the marchioness separated, each to find <b>her</b> <b>pillow,</b> if not her repose.|$|E
6000|$|The {{following}} morning the ogress told {{the young man}} that he must take all the feathers out of <b>her</b> <b>pillows</b> and spread them to dry in the sun. But if one feather was missing {{when she came back}} at night his head should pay for it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, dear! oh, dear!" [...] {{she sobbed}} softly into <b>her</b> <b>pillows.</b> It seemed {{a terrible thing}} to her that one of her race and kin was to be married and she could not be present at the ceremony, she who had never seen a Gordon bride.|$|R
60|$|She {{was soon}} better, and leaning back on <b>her</b> <b>pillows</b> exhausted, {{looked up at}} the fine tall boy before her, the glow of youth and health on his face, spirit and {{enterprise}} in every feature,--but those large blue eyes, bright as they were, for ever darkened and useless.|$|R
