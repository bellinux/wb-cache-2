5|$|During the Act's early history, Section 3(c) {{was little}} used; no jurisdictions were bailed <b>in</b> <b>until</b> 1975. Between 1975 and 2013, 18 jurisdictions were bailed in, {{including}} 16 {{local governments and}} the states of Arkansas and New Mexico. Although the Supreme Court held the Section 4(b) coverage formula unconstitutional in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), it did not hold Section 3(c) unconstitutional. Therefore, jurisdictions may continue to be bailed-in and subjected to Section 3(c) preclearance. In the months following Shelby County, courts began to consider requests by the Attorney General and other plaintiffs to bail in the states of Texas and North Carolina, and in January 2014 a federal court bailed in Evergreen, Alabama.|$|E

Kennedy brought with him Wahl, Lindsay Helmholz, David Lipkin, Herbert Potratz, and Samuel Weissman, who all served on the faculty at Washington University. Up to this time, Washington University was primarily concerned with undergraduate teaching.

5|$|In Southeast Asia and Indonesia, male {{long hair}} was valued <b>in</b> <b>until</b> the seventeenth century, when the area adopted outside {{influences}} including Islam and Christianity. Invading cultures enforced shorter hairstyles on men {{as a sign}} of servitude, as well. They were also confused at the short hairstyles among women in certain areas, such as Thailand, and struggled to explain why women in the area had such short hair. They came up with several mythical stories, one of which involved a king who found a long hair in his rice and, in a rage, demanded that all women keep their hair short.|$|E

5|$|Passenger service {{began on}} September 11, 1972, {{initially}} just between MacArthur and Fremont. The {{rest of the}} system opened in stages, with the entire system opening in 1974 when the transbay service though the Transbay Tube began. The new BART system was hailed as {{a major step forward}} in subway technology, although questions were asked concerning the safety of the system and the huge expenditures necessary for the construction of the network. Ridership remained well below projected levels throughout the 1970s, and direct service from Daly City to Richmond and Fremont was not phased <b>in</b> <b>until</b> several years after the system opened.|$|E
5|$|Stamp {{booklets}} {{were first}} put on sale on 21 August 1931. Booklet construction was a lightweight cardboard cover stitched on the left-hand side with panes of stamps (usually four panes), advertising panes and interleaving bound <b>in.</b> <b>Until</b> 1956 most booklets had {{half of the}} front cover devoted to advertising, and until 1963 booklets also had serial numbers on the front cover: two numbers indicated the year of issue and serial number (in that order on the early issues but with the order reversed for later issues), until 1963 when the serial numbers ceased.|$|E

5|$|After a long chase, the Flying Monkeys {{succeed in}} {{capturing}} their targets {{and bring them}} back to Evillene. Vengeful for Dorothy having killed her sister, she dismembers the Scarecrow, flattens the Tin Man, and tortures the Lion in hopes of making Dorothy give her the silver shoes. When she threatens to throw Toto into a fiery cauldron, Dorothy nearly gives <b>in</b> <b>until</b> the Scarecrow hints to her to activate a fire sprinkler switch, which she does. The sprinklers put out the fire but also melt Evillene. She is flushed down into her throne, the lid of which slams shut like a toilet. With Evillene finally gone, her spells lose their power: the Winkies are freed from their permanent costumes (revealing attractive humans underneath) and their sweatshop tools disappear. They rejoice in dance and praise Dorothy as their emancipator. The Flying Monkeys give her and her friends a triumphant ride back to the Emerald City.|$|E

5|$|After its reconstruction, the Mezhyhirya Monastery {{became a}} {{regional}} {{center of the}} Zaporozhian Host, serving the host as a military monastery. In 1610, the monastery received {{the status of a}} stauropegic monastery (orthodox church autonomy), under the Patriarch of Constantinople. The universal (act) of Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky issued on May 21, 1656 transferred the neighboring settlements of Vyshhorod, Novi Petrivtsi, and Moshchany under control of the Mezhyhirya Monastery. In effect, the universal made Khmelnytsky the monastery's ktitor. After the destruction of the Trakhtemyrivskyi Monastery by a Polish szlachta army, the Mezhyhirya Monastery replaced it as the main cossack military monastery. As a military monastery, retired and elderly cossacks from the Zaporozhian Host would now come to the monastery to retire and live <b>in</b> <b>until</b> the end of their lives.

5|$|By 1949 Swift was 35 years old, but {{was still}} {{performing}} well enough to maintain {{his place in the}} England team. However, he decided that he wanted to retire while still capable of playing at the top level, rather than fading away. To this end he announced that he would retire {{at the end of the}} 1948–49 season. He made what he intended to be his last Manchester City appearance against Huddersfield Town on 7 May, which was followed by a parade in his honour organised by the Supporters' Club. However, just before the next season started, Swift's replacement Alec Thurlow fell ill with tuberculosis, and Swift agreed to step <b>in</b> <b>until</b> City found a new goalkeeper. Four further appearances took his career total to 338. Aware of attempts by other clubs to tempt Swift out of retirement, most notably by Manchester United, the Manchester City board continued to hold Swift's playing registration for several years.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with one}} last push over {{mountains}} that {{were described as}} much worse than the Wasatch, the ragtag company had {{to decide whether to}} forge ahead or rest their cattle. It was October 20 and they had been told that the pass would not be snowed <b>in</b> <b>until</b> the middle of November. William Pike was killed when a gun being loaded by William Foster was discharged negligently, an event that seemed to make the decision for them; family by family, they resumed their journey, first the Breens, then Kesebergs, Stanton with the Reeds, Graveses, and Murphys. The Donners waited and traveled last. After a few miles of rough terrain, an axle broke on one of the Donners' wagons. Jacob and George went into the woods to fashion a replacement. George Donner sliced his hand open while chiseling the wood, but it seemed a superficial wound.|$|E

F.C. United hosted a test event at Broadhurst Park on 16 May 2015, staging a short match between their first team and an Invitational XI made up of past players. The official opening game was a friendly against Benfica B on 29 May, the anniversary of Manchester United's victory over Benfica in the 1968 European Cup Final.

5|$|In late 1832, the Democratic Party {{convention}} nominated Pierce {{for one of}} New Hampshire's five {{seats in}} the U.S. House of Representatives. This was tantamount to election for the young Democrat, as the National Republicans had faded as a political force, while the Whigs had not yet begun to attract a large following. Democratic strength in New Hampshire was also bolstered by Jackson's landslide re-election that year. New Hampshire had been a marginal state politically, but from 1832 through the mid-1850s became the most reliably Democratic state in the North, boosting Pierce's political career. Pierce's term began in March 1833, {{but he would not}} be sworn <b>in</b> <b>until</b> Congress met in December, and his attention was elsewhere.

Joe is still against the idea but when the trio witness an infuriated Jeff severely attack Brenda for simply changing the channel on Quagmire's TV, he renounces his hesitance and agrees to murder him. The three decide to talk Jeff into a hunting trip {{in an attempt to}} kill him, and make it look like an accident. Having expected it, however, Jeff reveals his own gun, and knocks Peter and Joe out so that he can kill Quagmire in a deeper part of the woods. Once there, Quagmire talks Jeff into fighting him instead, during which Quagmire is seemingly strangled to death. Jeff then goes to dig a grave to put Quagmire's body <b>in,</b> <b>until</b> he sees an angry Quagmire, alive and well, behind the wheel of Peter's car. Quagmire reveals that he chokes himself everyday and kills Jeff by running him over, smashing his head into a tree with the car. Peter, Joe and Quagmire return home the next day, and present Brenda with a forged note from Jeff stating that he has decided to leave her. As Brenda breaks down in tears over Jeff, Peter notes that he wishes he could kill someone else and gets an idea about Mort before the episode ends.|$|E
