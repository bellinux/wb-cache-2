Producers prefer forage made with these {{machines}} because {{they are able to}} deliver a feed value that enables improved productivity of their animals in terms of milk production for dairy animals and weight gain for beef animals. Self-propelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> are able to make a variety of feed from different crops, including whole-plant corn silage, earlage, and haylage, among others. The self-propelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvester</b> is a complex and expensive piece of machinery for a producer to own. The self-propelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvester</b> market in the United States is a growing market, but small when compared to other equipment such as combines. In today’s environment, productivity is crucial {{to the success of the}} agricultural producer. Self-propelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> are no exception. Growth of the self-propelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvester</b> market is reflected in increased unit sales, total horsepower sold, and average horsepower of the selfpropelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> sold in the United States. This study looks at changes in the number and size of self-propelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> being purchased and what factors might be driving those changes. This study found that the amount of milk produced, the type of customer purchasing the equipment, and the average price of milk a producer received explained 81. 2 % of the variation in the number of self-propelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> sold from 2000 - 2014. Study results also show that the size of dairy operation, the type of customer purchasing the equipment, and the average price of milk explained 88 % of the variability in total horsepower of self-propelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> sold from 2000 - 2014. Finally, the size of dairy operation that a typical cow comes from, the type of customer purchasing the equipment, and the average price of corn were able to explain 98 % of the variation of average horsepower of self-propelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> over that same time period. The model and analysis will be shared with product planners from John Deere as they develop new machine specifications for self-propelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> in the future...|$|R

40|$|Many field {{experiments}} {{require the}} collection of forage yields in addition to grain yield (small grains). ln smal! plot research, mechanized grain harvest is common. However, forage harvest is often accomplished by hand which is time consuming and labor intensive. Sample heterogeneity increases when forage harvest is obtained by hand. The objectives {{of this study were}} to construct a mechanized <b>forage</b> <b>harvester</b> that would simplify the harvesting process while providing a homogenous sample and to determine forage yield reduction associated with using the harvester compared to hand clipping at the soil surface. A John Deere GT 262 <b>self</b> <b>propelled</b> rotary mower was modified to be used for small plot wheat forage harvesting. Field trials were established at two locations to determine the yield reduction associated with using the <b>forage</b> <b>harvester</b> versus hand clipping at the soil surface. Significant differences in yield were found at both locations. The mean dry matter yield averaged over two years and two Iocations obtained using the harvester was 63. 1 % of that obtained by hand clipping at the soil surface during growth stages Feekes 6 and Feekes 10. Total N in wheat forage collected was significantly different using the harvester versus hand clipping. This is partially explained by decreased N in the lower stems at later stages of reproductive growth. The design of the harvester makes it possible to harvest several plots in {{a short amount of time}} while also allowing a larger area to be harvested which increases experimental accuracy and sample homogeneity. When the efficiency of the <b>forage</b> <b>harvester</b> (0. 631) is used as a correction factor, the difference between the estimated and actual amounts of forage present is S 4 o/" of the total forage present (Feekes 6 through Feekes 10) ...|$|R
