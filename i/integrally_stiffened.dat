40|$|<b>Integrally</b> <b>Stiffened</b> Panels (ISP) {{structures}} {{are composed of}} a base plate and one (or several) longitudinal stiffness sections of simple or complex shape. When compared to conventional reinforced structures, they present an integral profile, as the stiffened panel is obtained as a whole {{by means of an}} extrusion process. The choice of a ISP profile can lead to a more robust and defects-free solution, simultaneously maintaining the possibility to adopt complex reinforcement shapes. In the present work, three algorithms are studied and compared in the cross-section optimization of <b>Integrally</b> <b>Stiffened</b> Panels for aeronautical applications: (i) the classical Levenberg-Marquardt, (ii) the Simulated Annealing methodology, and a recently proposed approach involving (iii) a differential/nature-based algorithm called Hybrid Differential Evolution Particle Swarm Optimization (HDEPSO).

Additionally, the presence of a Friction Stir Weld (FSW) zone is also taken into account, from the joining between distinct ISP's.

40|$|State-of-the-art <b>integrally</b> <b>stiffened</b> {{composite}} materials, manufactured {{for use in}} {{the next}} generation of commercial and military aircraft, are being increasingly used for structural components such as wings and fuselages. However, due to the complexity of the manufacturing process, small variations in the shape of <b>integrally</b> <b>stiffened</b> composite structures often occur. Thus, a prioriknowledge of the part shape often does not provide sufficient tolerance to allow an automated conventional ultrasonic inspection. Many of the advantages of laser-based ultrasonics, including its noncontacting nature and applicability to rapid scanning of contoured and <b>integrally</b> <b>stiffened</b> structures, have been described previously [1 – 5]. To further extend the utility of laser-based ultrasonics, enable limited access inspections and also provide an upgrade/retrofit path for existing ultrasonic scanning systems, it is desirable {{to reduce the size of}} current laser-based ultrasound (LBU) system scan heads and provide both generation and detection laser beam delivery via optical fibers. A promising approach is the use of a scanning head based on a Cassegrain optical collection system. This approach minimizes the load carrying requirements of the scanning assembly and is also well-suited for integration with fiber optics to allow the delivery and reception of the ultrasonic generation and detection laser beams via long lengths of optical fiber. This provides increased mobility of the LBU scan head and allows the ultrasonic generation and detection lasers and other sensitive equipment to be housed in a clean environment which potentially can be located hundreds of meters from the inspection area. The use of a pulsed CO 2 laser has been reported previously for generation of ultrasonic waves in composite materials [4]. However, the CO 2 laser wavelength (λ = 10. 6 μm) and the high peak power laser pulses precludes the use of fiber-optic beam delivery over all but very short lengths (3 ̆c 1. 5 m) of specialized optical fiber. Consequently an alternative generating laser has been sought that can be transmitted efficiently over standard quartz optical fiber. An alexandrite laser, which is tunable over the 720 – 800 nm wavelength range, is being investigated for this application. Progress towards the implementation of a fiber-based LBU system for rapid NDE of large-area composites, and the use of an alexandrite laser for ultrasonic generation in composite materials are described below...|$|E

40|$|In {{launch vehicle}} {{structures}} design, importance {{is given to}} lightweight with high load bearing capacity design, so the factor of safety is kept low compared with ground-based structures {{and at the same}} time maintaining high reliability. This demands very accurate analysis of structural elements for launch vehicle. The main criteria are lightweight, ease of fabrication, lower cost {{and at the same time}} meeting the strength and stiffness requirements. The commonly used launch vehicle structure is the closely stiffened structure in which the structure consists of 90 or 120 no’s of stringers riveted onto a 1. 2 mm thick skin and a few number of bulkheads. In this type of structures, thin shell can buckle or cripple at a load much lower than the buckling strength of stringers. In order to overcome this, <b>integrally</b> <b>stiffened</b> structures such as isogrid structures is chosen. Isogrid is the name given to integrally, grid stiffened shell and structures in which the grids form an equilateral triangle pattern. The isogrid structure can withstand both compressive and bending loads and also offers lower weight and higher structural efficiency. A typical inter tank structure that was preliminary designed using closely stiffened shell structure has been identified for study. This is a cylindrical structure having a diameter of 4. 0 m and a height of 2. 75 m which should safely withstand the loads expected on it during different phases of flight. It should safely carry the accessories needed for the next stage separation.

This paper proposes a framework to perform a cost-benefit analysis of a technology in the R&D phase. This framework was developed and used to assess the Advanced Near Net Shape Technology (ANNST) manufacturing process for fabricating <b>integrally</b> <b>stiffened</b> cylinders. The ANNST method was compared with the conventional multi-piece metallic construction and composite processes for fabricating <b>integrally</b> <b>stiffened</b> cylinders. Following the definition of a case study for a cryogenic tank cylinder of specified geometry, data was gathered through interviews with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), with particular focus placed on production costs and process complexity. This data served as the basis to produce process flowcharts and timelines, mass estimates, and rough order-of-magnitude cost and schedule estimates. The scalability of the results was subsequently investigated to understand the variability of the results based on tank size. Lastly, once costs and benefits were identified, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to assess the relative value of these achieved benefits for potential stakeholders.

The current study evaluated Al-Cu-Mg-Ag alloy RX 226 -T 8 in plate gages and compared performance with sheet gage alloys of similar composition. Uniaxial tensile properties, plane strain initiation fracture toughness, and plane stress tearing resistance of RX 226 -T 8 were examined at ambient temperature as a function of orientation and thickness location in the plate. Properties were measured near the surface and at the mid-plane of the plate. Tensile strengths were essentially isotropic, with variations in yield and ultimate tensile strengths of less than 2 % as a function of orientation and through-thickness location. However, ductility varied by more than 15 % with orientation. Fracture toughness was generally higher at the mid-plane and greater for the L-T orientation, although the differences were small near the surface of the plate. Metallurgical analysis indicated that the microstructure was primarily recrystallized with weak texture and was uniform through the plate {{with the exception of a}} fine-grained layer near the surface of the plate. Scanning electron microscope analysis revealed Al-Cu-Mg second phase particles which varied in composition and were primarily located on grain boundaries parallel to the rolling direction. Fractography of toughness specimens for both plate locations and orientations revealed that fracture occurred predominantly by transgranular microvoid coalescence. Introduction High-strength, low-density Al-Cu-Mg-Ag alloys were initially developed to replace conventional 2000 (Al-Cu-Mg) and 7000 (Al-Zn-Cu-Mg) series aluminum alloys for aircraft structural applications [1]. During the High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) program, improvements in thermal stability were demonstrated for candidate aircraft wing and fuselage skin materials through the addition of silver to Al-Cu-Mg alloys based on Al 2519 chemistry [2]. Thermal stability of the resulting Al-Cu-Mg-Ag alloys, C 415 -T 8 and C 416 -T 8, was due to co-precipitation of the thermally stable. (AlCu) and ' (Al 2 Cu) strengthening phases [1 - 4]. The strength and toughness behavior was investigated for these alloys produced as 0. 090 -inch thick rolled sheet in the T 8 condition and after various thermal exposures. The mechanical properties were shown to be competitive with conventional aircraft alloys, 2519 -T 8 and 2618 -T 8 [2]. During the Integral Airframe Structure (IAS) program, advanced aluminum alloys were examined for use in an <b>integrally</b> <b>stiffened</b> airframe structure where the skin and stiffeners would be machined from plate and extruded frames would be mechanically attached (see Figure 1) [5]. Advantages of <b>integrally</b> <b>stiffened</b> structure include reduced part count, and reduced assembly times compared to conventional built-up airframe structure. The near-surface properties of a thick plate are of significance for a machined <b>integrally</b> <b>stiffened</b> airframe structure since this represents the skin location. Properties measured at the mid-plane of the plate are more representative of the stiffener web. RX 226 was developed to exploit strength-toughness improvements and thermal stability benefits of Al-Cu-Mg-Ag alloys in plate gages. This study evaluated the microstructure and properties of three gages of plate produced in the T 8 condition...|$|E
