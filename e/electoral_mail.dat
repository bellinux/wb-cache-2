50|$|A {{by-election}} {{was held}} for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Penrith on 19 June 2010. The by-election was triggered by the resignation of sitting Labor member and former Parliamentary Secretary for Education and Training Karyn Paluzzano, who had lied to an Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) inquiry over her actions, such as signing false staff payslips and rorting her <b>electoral</b> <b>mail</b> allowance. Paluzzano resigned from Cabinet after she admitted lying to ICAC. Paluzzano resigned from Parliament on 7 May 2010, hours after being suspended from the Labor Party.|$|E
5000|$|In December 2009, Timothy Horan, an Electorate Officer {{working for}} Paluzzano, alleged to the clerk of the Legislative Assembly that Paluzzano had {{illegally}} used public {{money to fund}} her re-election campaign. At first she denied the accusation at a preliminary Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) hearing on 16 April 2010. At a subsequent ICAC hearing on 5 May, Paluzzano admitted to falsely signing employee pay forms and using her <b>electoral</b> <b>mail</b> allowance for political purposes. The Commission, after completing its inquiry in July 2010, recommended that criminal changes be laid against Paluzzano. ICAC asked the Director of Public Prosecutions to consider charging Paluzzano over a range of offences, including misconduct in public office, obtaining money {{for one of her}} staff members, obtaining a [...] "valuable thing" [...] for herself and misleading corruption investigators.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} that socioeconomically disadvantaged Australians have poorer self-rated dental health (SRDH), {{are less likely to}} be insured for dental services and are less likely to have regular dental visits than their more advantaged counterparts. However, less is known about the associations between dental insurance and SRDH. The aim of this study was to examine the associations between SRDH and dental insurance status and to test if the relationship was modified by household income. METHODS: A random sample of 3, 000 adults aged 30 - 61 years was drawn from the Australian <b>Electoral</b> Roll and <b>mailed</b> a self-complete questionnaire. Analysis included dentate participants. Bivariate associations were assessed between SRDH and insurance stratified by household income group. A multiple variable model adjusting for covariates estimated prevalence ratios (PR) of having good to excellent SRDH and included an interaction term for insurance and household income group. RESULTS: The response rate was 39. 1 % (n[*]=[*] 1, 093). More than half (53. 9 %) of the participants were insured and 72. 5 % had good to excellent SRDH. SRDH was associated with age group, brushing frequency, insurance status and income group. Amongst participants in the $ 40, 000 -[*]<[*]$ 80, 000 income group, the insured had a higher proportion reporting good to excellent SRDH (80. 8 %) than the uninsured (66. 5 %); however, there was little difference in SRDH by insurance status for those in the $ 120, 000 + income group. After adjusting for covariates, there was a significant interaction (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) between having insurance and income; there was an association between insurance and SRDH for adults in the $ 40, 000 -[*]<[*]$ 80, 000 income group, but not for adults in higher income groups. CONCLUSIONS: For lower socio-economic groups being insured was associated with better SRDH, but there was no association for those in the highest income group. Insurance coverage may have the potential to improve dental health for low income groups. Dana N Teusner, Olga Anikeeva and David S Brenna...|$|R
