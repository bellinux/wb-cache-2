25|$|At the {{proposal}} of Thundop and Gompo Tashi in early 1960, a Tibetan guerrilla base {{was established in}} Mustang, Nepal, where some 2,000 mostly ethnic Khampa amassed in such a disorderly fashion that the first year was a challenge for survival given that the US could not get food supplies to them due to a suspension of overflights stemming from the U-2 incident. By spring 1961, Mustang guerrilla units had begun raids along a 250-mile stretch inside Tibet. In addition, some 12,000 Tibetans eventually joined the Special Frontier Force that manned the Sino-Indian border. But {{as the years passed}} without any bases established inside Tibet, US enthusiasm over the Mustang fighters dwindled and already sparse and insufficient arms drops ceased in 1965, leaving an aging and barely armed guerrilla force in dire straits. The 25 small teams of Colorado-trained Tibetans who were sent into Tibet from 1964 to 1967 on <b>fact-finding</b> <b>missions</b> had no better luck. Only two were able to operate in-country for more than two months, finding no support from compatriots.|$|E
500|$|Early in the Roosevelt administration, Hickok is {{credited}} with pushing Eleanor to write her own newspaper column, [...] "My Day", and to hold weekly press conferences specifically for female journalists. Hickok {{found it difficult to}} objectively cover the Roosevelts herself, however, and once suppressed a story at Eleanor's request. The declining quality of her reporting soon caused her to receive a pay cut. Despite her worries about leaving the career on which she had built her identity, Hickok quit the AP at Eleanor's urging in mid-1933. Eleanor then helped Hickok obtain the position as a Chief Investigator for Harry Hopkins' Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA), where she conducted <b>fact-finding</b> <b>missions.</b> In 1933, Hickok went on a two-month tour of the American South, where she was horrified by the poverty, malnutrition, and lack of education that she encountered. She urged Eleanor to visit a tent city of homeless ex-miners in Morgantown, West Virginia, an experience that led Eleanor to found the federal housing project of Arthurdale, West Virginia. In March 1934, Hickok accompanied Eleanor on a fact-finding trip to the US territory of Puerto Rico, reporting afterward to Hopkins that the island's poverty was too severe for FERA to usefully intervene.|$|E

2500|$|Members of Congress make <b>fact-finding</b> <b>missions</b> {{to learn}} about other {{countries}} and stay informed, but these outings can cause controversy if the trip is deemed excessive or unconnected {{with the task of}} governing. For example, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2009 that lawmaker trips abroad at taxpayer expense had included spas, $300-per-night extra unused rooms, and shopping excursions. Lawmakers respond that [...] "traveling with spouses compensates for being away from them a lot in Washington" [...] and justify the trips as a way to meet officials in other nations.|$|E

2500|$|Lindsay {{served on}} the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, known as the Kerner Commission. This body was {{established}} in 1967 by President Johnson after riots in urban centers of the US, including Newark and Detroit. Lindsay maximized publicity and coverage of his activities on the commission, and while other commissioners made inconspicuous visits to riot-damaged sites, Lindsay would alert the press before his <b>fact-finding</b> <b>missions.</b> Nonetheless, he was especially influential in producing the Kerner Report; its dramatic language of the nation [...] "moving toward two societies, one black, one white—separate and unequal" [...] was his rhetoric.|$|E
2500|$|The inquiry {{members said}} that the mission {{investigated}} whether Israel, Hamas or the Palestinian Authority had unnecessarily harmed innocent civilians, stating [...] "On those issues the letter co-signed by Chinkin expressed no view at all." [...] The members wrote that the fact-finding mission was not a judicial or even a quasi-judicial proceeding. Hillel Neuer, director of UN Watch, {{said that the}} basic standards for international <b>fact-finding</b> <b>missions</b> had been ignored. Goldstone agreed that the letter {{could have been the}} grounds for disqualification if the mission had been a judicial inquiry. Two groups, a group of UK lawyers and academics, and a group of Canadian lawyers, said they supported the UN Watch request that Chinkin be disqualified and expressed disappointment that it was rejected.|$|E
2500|$|The report condemns Israel's actions {{during the}} {{conflict}} for [...] "the application of disproportionate {{force and the}} causing of great damage and destruction to civilian property and infrastructure, and suffering to civilian populations". It {{came to the conclusion}} [...] "that there was strong evidence to establish that numerous serious violations of international law, both humanitarian law and human rights law, were committed by Israel during the military operations in Gaza". The report claims that Israel made disproportionate or excessive use of white phosphorus. Israel has also come under fire from other <b>fact-finding</b> <b>missions</b> over the use of white phosphorus – an incendiary weapon which is deemed illegal to use against civilians (forbidden by the Geneva Conventions) or in civilian areas by Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons – and depleted uranium during the conflict.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2009, Goldstone, Travers and Jilani {{signed an}} open letter to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the United Nations Security Council, calling for those who perpetrated [...] "gross {{violations}} of the laws of war", [...] "gross violations of international humanitarian law" [...] and [...] "targeting of civilians" [...] to be brought to account. The letter concluded: [...] "The events in Gaza have shocked us to the core. Relief and reconstruction are desperately needed but, for the real wounds to heal, we must also establish the truth about crimes perpetuated against civilians on both sides." [...] The chief rabbi of South Africa Warren Goldstein and Melanie Phillips asserted that this statement, made before the work of the mission has begun, violated provisions for impartiality of the <b>fact-finding</b> <b>missions.</b> Mary Robinson called Goldstone [...] "a dedicated and unimpeachable human rights lawyer and advocate" [...] who [...] "was able to work with the [...] Council's president to secure an agreement that he felt confident would permit the mandate to be interpreted {{in such a way as}} to allow his team to address the actions taken by both parties to the conflict".|$|E
2500|$|Professor Colin Mackerras states, [...] "There {{was a major}} {{rebellion}} against Chinese rule in Tibet in March 1959, which was put down {{with the cost of}} much bloodshed and lasting bitterness {{on the part of the}} Tibetans." [...] The Tibetan government-in-exile reports variously, 85,000, 86,000, and 87,000 deaths for Tibetans during the rebellion, attributed to [...] "secret Chinese documents captured by guerrillas". Tibetologist Tom Grunfeld said [...] "the veracity of such a claim is difficult to verify." [...] Warren W. Smith, a writer with Radio Free Asia, writes that the [...] "secret documents" [...] came from a 1960 PLA report captured by guerrillas in 1966, with the figures first published by the TGIE in India in 1990. Smith states that the documents said that 87,000 [...] "enemies were eliminated", but he does not take [...] "eliminated" [...] to mean [...] "killed", as the TGIE does. A Tibetan Government in Exile (TGIE) official surnamed Samdup released a report for Asia Watch after three <b>fact-finding</b> <b>missions</b> from 1979 to 1981, stating that a speech by premier Zhou Enlai, published in Beijing Review in 1980, confirmed the 87,000 figure. Demographer Yan Hao could find no reference to any such figure in the published speech, and concluded, [...] "If these TGIE sources are not reluctant to fabricate Chinese sources in open publications, how can they expect people to believe in their citations of so-called Chinese secret internal documents and speeches that are never available in originals to independent researchers?" ...|$|E
