The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide said [...] "A deliberately mawkish Christmas episode that is low on good jokes (although the Simpsons watching their own fire on television is a good start) and a retread of any number of episodes where Bart does wrong, feels guilty and eventually has to <b>fess</b> <b>up.</b> The only real ray of sunshine is the closing moments when the neighbours get their revenge but the Simpsons find the family spirit after all." ...|$|E

40|$|To {{be asked}} to speak of oneself is more a burden than opportunity. If {{thinking}} is immersed in one’s life and situation it can no more be objectified than one’s loves or disgusts. The tone is impossible to stipulate. It wavers. It can’t help but be retrospective like Minerva’s owl. But it may attempt to speak primarily not {{to what has been}} done but what remains undone. Its speaking, <b>fessing</b> <b>up,</b> then becomes an aspiration. In this, one may hope not to be alone. Thought in any case belongs to nobody. One seeks only to belong to thought...|$|R

The latest news release from this sunny-Jim industry group finally <b>fesses</b> <b>up</b> to its past fiction, {{but even when}} it admits the bubble's going to pop, it can't muster the courage to just {{come out and say}} it. … the NAR is full of it and will spin the numbers any way it can to keep up the pleasant fiction that all is well. … The cracks began to show in subsequent remarks from NAR 'Chief Economist' David Lereah. The head outfit that ridiculed the idea of a housing bubble for years is now crying for Ben Bernanke to bring it back. … It should have been completely obvious to anyone with a loan calculator and a glance at wage increases that those months of industry bubble denials were just wishful thinking." ...|$|R
5000|$|After the {{publication}} of Infinite Crisis #5, Johns said at the Wizard World LA convention: [...] "That {{took me a long}} time to break, because I thought Superboy-Prime needed to view the world so narrow. You can see how his world view is so narrow and so black and white and realistically that is not going to work anymore". Originally, Superboy-Prime started out coming into Crisis as corrupted and evil, but the take on the character did not work for Johns. [...] "I said to Dan I think Prime does it by accident and is horrified. That panel where's he is looking at his hands and goes 'I didn't mean to do it', that for me is the entire story for Superboy-Prime. He didn't mean to do this stuff. What is worse... making a mistake and <b>fessing</b> <b>up</b> to it or doing something bad and saying 'You made me do it?'. Superboy-Prime is a very simplistic character who has become very complex".|$|R

The message is a simple one: it's your life, take responsibility for it, say you're sorry and <b>fess</b> <b>up</b> when you do something wrong. That has to be delivered in an entertaining way and, fortunately, I don't have to act. I don't have a script. It is what it is." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Model UN {{challenge}} starts; as {{the study}} group gets into their roles, Abed postulates how there can be two UNs, to which Cligoris claims that each UN represents a parallel world. The two teams are given random conflicts, {{and their ability to}} work together to resolve the conflict with the best results is used to determine their score. Annie E. and {{the study group}} appear ready to win when one of them farts; no one <b>fesses</b> <b>up</b> and the group laughs at it, breaking their attention. Annie gets upset at the group, but Jeff tells her she's acting like a school girl, causing her to run away. Jeff follows her to the study room and apologizes. Annie worries that she is acting like a school girl, but Jeff asserts that he sees her as more mature than that. They realize they have romantic feelings for each other but decide to stay at a comfortable distance, and then return to the competition. Now close to losing, Abed comes up with a plan; as a group, they appear at Annie K.'s UN as representatives from their parallel world, offering to make peace with this UN. Annie K. refuses to do so, but Professor Cligoris sees Annie E.'s actions as appropriate [...] "empty promises" [...] that the UN was built on, and asserts Annie E.'s team the winner.|$|R
50|$|While {{inspecting}} the elevators {{of a newly}} built residential high rise an elevator inspector almost dies. The problem is {{brought to the attention}} of the heads of the construction corporation. One of the executive <b>fesses</b> <b>up</b> that the problem is not the elevator but the building itself because the foundations are not straight and the problem is the same with other buildings they have constructed. ICAC is asked to investigate, they tail the workers of the construction company. ICAC finds out that the building supervisor Leung Dik Wai (Raymond Wong) is never at the construction site but his signature on documents claimed he was. Lai Chi Kit (Edmond Leung) is another building supervisors, unlike Dik Wai, Chi Kit is hardworking. Their boss Chan Lik Tou (Law Lok Lam) tells Dik Wai he will promote him to head building supervisor but a loyal worker tells Lik Tou that he is making a mistake and Lik Tou promotes Chi Kit instead. Chi Kit has a hard time handling his new responsibility since he is dealt with a limited budget and time for completing constructions of the building. Dik Wai who resents Chi Kit uses this as an opportunity for Chi Kit downfall by suggesting to their boss on using a not compliance material to complete the building. Lik Tou who only cares about the budget agrees to Dik Wai's plan but they don't have enough budget to buy the material. Dik Wai steals Chi Kit's girlfriend in the process so Chi Kit hatches a revenge plan by suggesting the building foundation columns be filled with water which is dangerous and illegal, but Lik Tou agrees to it. Chi Kit guilt eventually gets the better of him and he quits his job, but ICAC arrest all of them.|$|R
5000|$|It's {{hard to see}} {{anything}} but politics as the motivation for Fitzgerald's handling of the Plame affair. The facts indicate that Fitzgerald knew early on that the original leaker was State Department official Richard Armitage. So why did Fitzgerald let a cloud hang over White House adviser Karl Rove's head for so long? And why is Fitzgerald continuing to hound Libby, the former vice presidential chief of staff?The answer {{seems to be that}} Armitage, who is charged with nothing and brags that he hasn't even consulted a lawyer, was former Secretary of State Colin Powell's right-hand man and a critic of pre-emptive war in Iraq. Libby, on the other hand, was an architect of that war strategy. Do doves get a pass in Fitzgerald's book, while hawks get an indictment?..."Armitage himself was aggressively investigated" [...] by Fitzgerald. So Armitage <b>fessed</b> <b>up</b> at the outset. Fitzgerald long ago knew whom Armitage talked to and when. And he knew it was Armitage, not Libby, who was responsible for outing Plame (whose status as a secret CIA operative was dubious at best).Fitzgerald's contention in October that Libby was [...] "the first official known to have told a reporter ... about Valerie Wilson" [...] may therefore have been a lie. Fitzgerald knew {{in the early days of}} his politicized witch hunt that no crime was committed.No one intentionally revealed the identity of a truly covert agent. Yet he made a reporter, Miller, spend nearly 90 days in jail for refusing to reveal her source.Meanwhile, Fitzgerald refused to reveal to the public the true source. From top to bottom, this has been one of the most disgraceful abuses of prosecutorial power in this country's history. That it's taking place at a time of war only magnifies its sordidness.... The Plame case proves Fitzgerald can bend the truth with the proficiency of the slickest of pols.|$|R
5000|$|The {{release of}} their self-titled debut album (2004) {{introduced}} the band {{to a whole}} new audience in the United States. When it came time for recording the follow-up to the critically acclaimed record, Starfield teamed up with Bronleewe (Michael W. Smith, dc Talk, Plumb) for a second time while also enlisting the talents of GMA Award-winning producer Ed Cash (Chris Tomlin, David Crowder Band, Steven Curtis Chapman). The end result was, Beauty in the Broken (2006). [...] "When we began writing songs for Beauty in the Broken, our goal was to make a corporate worship record an album for the church", explains Tim Neufeld, the groups primary lyricist. [...] "However, as we got deeper into the process of music and lyric, we couldn't get away from our need to first address the often nagging disconnect between us and God its tough to march right into a song like Great is the Lord without first acknowledging the distance that exists between us and God. At {{the end of the day}} we felt like Beauty in the Broken was an incomplete worship record without songs like [...] "My Generation," [...] "Captivate," [...] and [...] "Shipwreck" [...] that <b>fess</b> <b>up</b> to the pain, condemnation, and doubt that often get in the way of true intimacy with Jesus." ...|$|E
40|$|As academics, {{we often}} worry about making {{ourselves}} look foolish, about giving {{critics of the}} academy more excuses to attack universities as a waste of taxpayers’ money {{in an age of}} austerity. So even where we <b>fess</b> <b>up</b> to the organic and serendipitous nature of the research process, there is a temptation to pull our punches, to make us look more professional (and less half arsed) than perhaps we really are. Social scientists are increasingly becoming project managers, setting the framework for other people to carry out the research and trying to make sure the findings create ‘impact’. Project management can, however, be highly creative and just as likely to be organic and serendipitous (and occasionally half-arsed) as the research process itself. This paper considers the practice of project management by two people running their first large grant, taking an often unflattering look about how we did things. Here we {{tell the story of the}} grant, and the impact of management decisions we made on the kind of project we ended up delivering. So this is a form of autoethnography, but we’re not so interested in the research, rathe...|$|E
40|$|The Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans (FCA), whose leaders govern {{well over}} half of the 80 million Anglicans worldwide, have put forward ‘a {{contemporary}} rule,’ called The Jerusalem Declaration, to guide the Anglican realignment movement. The FCA and its affiliates, e. g. the newly-formed Anglican Church in North America, require assent to the Declaration. To date, there has been little serious appraisal of the Declaration and the status accorded to it. I aim to correct that omission. Unlike ap-praisals in the social media, however, mine grants the FCA’s conservative stand on same-sex unions and homosexual practice. Nevertheless, I argue, the Declaration mischaracterizes the traditional Christian teaching on marriage, binds Anglicans to falsehoods and dubieties in the Thirty-Nine Articles, and adds to the gospel. Two things follow. First, no one—especially no Anglican who identifies herself as con-servative, traditional, orthodox, evangelical, Anglo-catholic or simply concerned with the truth—should assent to the Jerusalem Declaration. Second, since the FCA and its affiliates know that these defects ex-ist in the Declaration, they should <b>fess</b> <b>up</b> to these shortcomings and retract the Declaration’s status as ‘a contemporary rule’ and they should stop requiring assent to it. Anything less constitutes intellectual dis-honesty of a most egregious sort...|$|E
5000|$|... 22. Monday Night War - Eric Bischoff {{claims that}} despite what Paul Heyman {{would have you}} think (that ECW was the first victim of the Monday Night War by having top and irreplaceable talent leave ECW for WCW), WCW never 'raided' ECW. He claims Paul's wrestlers left because they weren't getting paid, and that the athletes knew WCW was a much larger place to {{showcase}} their talent. He does though make a fairly interesting point by asking {{if it was a}} [...] "raid" [...] on Vince McMahon's part when he took top talent from the local NWA territories in the 1980s because he was starting up a national expansion, and {{that it was not a}} [...] "raid" [...] in Vince McMahon's mind or in the minds of anyone employed with World Wrestling Federation at the time. He concludes by saying that the people who left WWF and ECW to come and work for WCW were personal and moral decisions made by the wrestlers themselves, not a raid. Paul Heyman responded by saying [...] "Eric Bischoff is full of shit and like many, never gave ECW the credit that ECW deserved." [...] And that stealing his ideas and his innovations and pawning them off as his own ideas was what put WCW on the map. Curiously, he [...] "praised" [...] Eric for doing so because he was in a ratings war against a rival company and needed the talent and ideas to compete with them. Paul then shrugs and wonders aloud as to why Eric never <b>fessed</b> <b>up</b> and said, [...] "I stole that from ECW." [...] He then added with what appears to be a small smile that they sued WCW over blatant plagiarism [...] "tons of times." [...] Seconds later, Vince McMahon admits that he raided ECW directly contradicting Bischoff's earlier comment, and that WCW did too. He goes on, however, to state that he compensated Paul for hiring his talent, something Eric Bishoff did not do.|$|R
5000|$|During [...] "The Silence of E. Lamb", Sydney {{walks out}} of a stall in the girls' {{bathroom}} as Alison and Emily are talking. She introduces herself to Alison and compliments her scarf. Sydney later discloses to Emily that someone left a rat in Paige's locker after practice. When Emily asks who did it, Sydney tells her no one has <b>fessed</b> <b>up,</b> and the coach wants a team meeting, but Sydney doesn't think it was someone on the Sharks as everyone loves Paige. Emily comments that she hasn't seen Paige yet, and Sydney deduces she skipped school. As Emily walks up to Mona and asks what she knows about Paige's incident, Mona greets Sydney, and Sydney greets her back. At the Brew, Driscoll is standing behind Hanna in the line where she introduces herself and mentions that she’s having a hot date with her homework. After asking if Hanna’s on her way out, Hanna replies she just had dinner at Emily’s. Sydney senses a whiff of alcohol coming from Hanna’s breath and asks if {{she would like to}} sit for a minute. When Hanna tells her she’s just going to head home, Sydney suggests Hanna to wait for her so they can split a Panini. During their meal, Sydney lifts a newspaper that has the Cavanaugh house explosion on the front, and mentions to Hanna that she was just reading about what happened. Hanna says that they were at Emily’s house when it happened, and when Driscoll asks if she knew who lived in the house, Hanna tells her that their friend Toby grew up there with his stepsister Jenna. Sydney states that Jenna’s name keeps popping up, and that people seem {{to have a lot of}} beef with her and asks Hanna if she’s ever wanted to make peace with Hanna. Hanna informs her that there was always the possibility that they could have done so and almost slips about the events that took place in New York with Shana. Having grabbed some more coffee, Sydney suggests dropping off Hanna off at home, but Hanna tells her she'll walk home instead. After asking if she’s sure, Driscoll picks up her books and tells Hanna that she’ll see her at school before walking out.|$|R
