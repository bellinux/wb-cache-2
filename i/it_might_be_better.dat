5|$|Jerry {{is unable}} {{to decide whether or}} not to tell George he is dating Marlene, but Jerry's ex-girlfriend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) {{eventually}} convinces him that he should. After being informed, George informs Jerry he has no problem with him dating Marlene. The following night, Jerry asks Marlene to come to his apartment, but she tells him that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> not to date him anymore. Jerry asks her why, to which she replies that she did not think his stand-up comedy act was funny, and that she could not date someone if she did not respect what they did.|$|E
25|$|Debriefing {{is another}} useful strategy. Healthcare {{providers}} meet {{to discuss a}} situation, record what they learned and discuss how <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> handled. Closed loop communication is another important technique used {{to ensure that the}} message that was sent is received and interpreted by the receiver. SBAR is a structured system designed to help team members communicate about the patient in the most convenient form possible. Communication between healthcare professionals not only helps achieve the best results for the patient but also prevents any unseen incidents.|$|E
25|$|The settlement's {{location}} {{above the}} point where the Esopus came out of the Catskills made it an ideal trading post for Indians responding to the European demand for beaver pelts to make the beaver hats then in vogue. In the later 17th century, with European settlement well established around the eastern Catskills, land replaced fur as the Indian-held commodity most desired by the new arrivals. The English government in London charged local officials with granting large chunks of land on the colonial frontier so that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> protected from the French to the north and west, but those officials dallied, only making such grants when they could enrich themselves and their friends in the process. The Catskills and the Esopus Valley, with little land that could be cleared for farming, were not suitable to that end.|$|E

500|$|In mid-June General Howe marched most of {{his army}} into central New Jersey {{in an attempt to}} lure George Washington's Continental Army to a place where <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> {{attacked}} than its defensive position in the Watchung Mountains. [...] When Washington refused to abandon his position Howe returned to Amboy on June22. [...] Washington's forward divisions, including that of Lord Stirling, shadowed this British movement, and Washington moved his main army out of the hills. [...] Howe seized this opportunity, and on June26 marched two columns of troops out in an attempt to cut Washington off from the high ground. [...] These troops skirmished with Lord Stirling's troops, and eventually engaged in a pitched battle in Scotch Plains. [...] Stirling's outnumbered force retreated, but Washington, alerted to the British movement, had by then retreated back into the hills.|$|E
2500|$|Yet, Gelman {{notes that}} {{so-called}} mystical {{experience is not}} a transitional event, as William James claimed, but an [...] "abiding consciousness, accompanying a person throughout the day, or parts of it. For that reason, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> to speak of mystical consciousness, which can be either fleeting or abiding." ...|$|E
2500|$|Aristotle {{suggested}} {{that the reason for}} anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors.

2500|$|Writers for The Hamilton Spectator and St. Louis Post-Dispatch said Caligula {{was one of}} {{the worst}} films they'd seen. Writing for The A.V. Club, Keith Phipps said, [...] "As a one-of-a-kind {{marriage}} of the historical epic and the porn film...Caligula deserves a look. But <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> to let Guccione's savagely unpleasant folly fade into the century that spawned it".|$|E

2500|$|During the Special Period, {{after the}} {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union, the Cuban government then took steps to improve the economy. Tourism was mildly encouraged, and Havana's music venues started to cater for visitors as well as locals. Before then, tourists were quite a rarity. When hip-hop emerged, the Cuban government opposed the vulgar image that rappers portrayed, but later accepted (1999) that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> to have hip-hop under the influence of the Ministry of Culture as an [...] "authentic expression of Cuban Culture".|$|E

2500|$|In January 2009, Käßmann {{expressed}} {{the opinion that}} <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> to tear down former and unused churches than {{to allow them to}} be used for purposes that could damage their image. As examples of such purposes, she mentioned conversion into restaurants, discothèques, or mosques. A reassignment to a synagogue, however, she found positive. After protests from Muslims, she slightly qualified her statement, saying: [...] "If a Christian congregation is convinced that the use as a mosque can happen in deepest peace, I concur, but at the moment I do not see that possibility." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Aristotle, spontaneity {{and chance}} are causes of some things, {{distinguishable}} from {{other types of}} cause. Chance as an incidental cause lies {{in the realm of}} accidental things. It is [...] "from what is spontaneous" [...] (but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance). For a better understanding of Aristotle's conception of [...] "chance" [...] <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> to think of [...] "coincidence": Something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place, but with the result of another thing (not intended) taking place.|$|E
2500|$|Robinson was {{successful}} despite the obstacle of racism. A favorite Robinson anecdote {{is that he}} seated himself in a restaurant and a customer objected to his presence. When the manager suggested that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> if Robinson leave, he smiled and asked, [...] "Have you got a ten-dollar bill?" [...] Politely asking to borrow the manager's note for a moment, Robinson added six $10 bills from his own wallet and mixed them up, then extended the seven bills together, adding, [...] "Here, let's see you pick out the colored one". The restaurant manager served Robinson without further delay.|$|E

60|$|Troublesome! no, indeed! I <b>was</b> only thinking--if <b>it</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>better</b> managed,' he answered, {{rather by}} way of giving himself time to debate whether the {{utterance}} of the one thought in his heart would lead to his being driven away.|$|R
30|$|Recently, the {{efficacy}} of preoperative HAI chemotherapy {{has been shown in}} patients with HCC and PVTT [27, 28].

2500|$|Gallinger {{had been}} offered {{contracts}} to play baseball by both the Boston Red Sox and Philadelphia Phillies while {{he was with the}} Bruins. In April 1946, Gallinger had a tryout with the Red Sox. Boston sportswriter Bill Grimes said Gallinger [...] "may {{turn out to be a}} great shortstop. He can run, he can throw, and he's got good power at the plate. he takes a level cut and hits the ball very sharply." [...] A sportswriter suggested to Gallinger <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> for him to try for an outfield position since the Red Sox's current shortstop Johnny Pesky was considered the league's best. Gallinger confidently replied that Pesky [...] "beat out somebody else for the job, didn't he?" [...] However, Gallinger turned down the baseball opportunities, because the money offered was too small.|$|E
2500|$|At a Cabinet {{meeting on}} 3 May 1939, the First Lord of Admiralty, Lord Stanhope, stated that [...] "at {{the present time}} Germany was {{building}} ships {{as fast as she}} could but that she {{would not be able to}} exceed the 35 per cent ratio before 1942 or 1943". Chatfield, now Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence, commented that Hitler had [...] "persuaded himself" [...] that Britain had provided the Reich with a [...] "free hand" [...] in Eastern Europe in exchange for the agreement. Chamberlain stated that Britain had never given such an understanding to Germany, and he commented that he first learned of Hitler's belief in such an implied bargain during his meeting with the Führer at the Berchtesgaden summit in September 1938. In a later paper to the Cabinet, Chatfield stated [...] "that we might say that we now understood Herr Hitler had in 1935 thought that we had given him a free hand in Eastern and Central Europe in return for his acceptance of the 100:35 ratio, but that as we could not accept the correctness of this view <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> that the 1935 arrangements should be abrogated".|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{his great}} wealth and high position, Thomas {{could not come}} to terms with his brother's {{appointment}} as Protector; and in his struggle with Somerset, he tried to ingratiate himself with the king, who was just a little boy. He sought the 9-year-old Edward to write a letter on his behalf in support of his marriage to the dowager queen, Catherine Parr. The letter was obviously dictated by Thomas for Edward's signature and only enraged Somerset. He began to visit Edward frequently, secretly giving him an extravagant allowance of coins, so that Edward might be satisfied in feeling more grown-up and more king-like, giving gifts to his servants, teachers, and friends. Even though he lived in sumptuous splendor, and wanting for nothing, no provisions had been made for Edward's pocket money and he became accustomed to these regular payments and began to ask Thomas freely for his allowance. Thomas continued his manipulation of the king. [...] In trying to get a bill through Parliament making him Edward's personal Governor, Thomas requested Edward's royal signature on the bill. [...] But Edward was uncertain, and reluctant to go behind the back of the Protector, Somerset, and of the regency council, and he would not sign it. [...] Thomas persistently pressured Edward, until Edward felt threatened. But Thomas did not give up. He tried to persuade Edward that he did not need a Protector, getting Edward to admit that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> for Somerset to die. [...] It is not known what the king meant by this, but it was probably uttered innocently. Thomas intended that the king's royal signature and personal support would destabilize Somerset's position as Protector, and {{as a member of the}} regency council. In his frustration and inability to gain any significant influence over the king, Thomas began to think in terms of open rebellion. [...] Although he was a boy, King Edward did not seem completely naïve regarding any of this. [...] For, it is recorded that Edward referred to William Parr, his step-mother's brother, as [...] "mine honest uncle," [...] indicating unspoken scorn for both of his Seymour uncles..|$|E
