40|$|Defining {{the risks}} present to both crewed and robotic spacecrafts {{is part of}} NASA s mission, and is {{critical}} to keep these resources out of <b>harm</b> <b>s</b> <b>way.</b> Characterizing orbital debris {{is an essential part}} of this mission. We present a proof-of-concept study that employs multiple techniques to demonstrate the efficacy of each approach. The targets of this study are IDCSPs (Initial Defense Communications Satellite Program). 35 of these satellites were launched by the US in the mid- 1960 s and were the first US military communications satellites in the GEO regime. They were emplaced in slightly sub-synchronous orbits. These targets were chosen for this proof-of-concept study for the simplicity of their observable exterior surfaces. The satellites are 26 -sided polygons (86 cm in diameter), initially spin-stabilized, and covered on all sides in solar panels. Data presented here include: (a) visible broadband photometry (Johnson/Kron-Cousins BVRI) taken with the 0. 9 m SMARTs telescope (Small and Medium Aperture Telescopes) at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in Chile in April, 2012, (b) laboratory broadband photometry (Johnson/ Bessell BVRI) of solar cells, obtained using the Optical Measurements Center (OMC) at NASA/JSC [1], (c) visible-band spectra taken using the Magellan 6. 5 m Baade Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile in May, 2012 [2], and (d) visible-band laboratory spectra of solar cells using an ASD Field Spectrometer. Color-color plots using broadband photometry (e. g. B-R vs. B-V) demonstrate that different material types fall into distinct areas on the plots [1]. Spectra of the same material types as those plotted in the color-color plots each display their own signature as well. Here, we compare lab data with telescopic data, and photometric results with spectroscopic results. The spectral response of solar cells in the visible wavelength regime varies from relatively flat to somewhat older solar cells whose reflectivity can be gently or sharply peaked in the blue. With a target like IDCSPs, the material type is known a priori, aiding in understanding how material type affects one s observations...|$|E
40|$|This {{story is}} about an {{unlikely}} NASA mission to the Moon. It was unlikely because it was started with far too little time and too-little money to complete. It was unlikely because {{it was able to}} take chances to accept risk of failure. It was unlikely because it was searching for the unthinkable: water-ice on the moon [...] . Figure 1 - 1 : LCROSS Mission. The mission of the Lunar CRater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) was to investigate the possibility of water ice in craters on the Moon s poles. This is certainly an interesting scientific topic in itself, but I intend to focus on the compelling experience of managing the LCROSS Project {{in the context of this}} storied Agency. Perhaps most interesting are the implications this story has for managing any development effort, lunar or not, and working a balance to achieve success. NASA is by design a risk-taking agency within the US Government. It could be argued that NASA s purpose in the aerospace community is to take on the really big challenges that either the corporate world can t afford, are not yet profitable endeavors, or are just too risky for private corporations to entertain. However, expectations of the Agency have evolved. A combination of grim human tragedies and some very public cost and schedule overruns have challenged the public s and Congress s tolerance for risk-taking within the Agency. NASA, which is supposed to be in the business of taking risks to do bold, difficult things, has become less and less able to do so within its cost framework. Yet effectively replacing prudent risk management with attempts to "risk-eliminate" is completely unaffordable. So where does risk-taking fit within the Agency, or within private/corporate organizations for that matter? Where astronauts play there is clearly concern about risk. When an organization puts humans in <b>harm</b> <b>s</b> <b>way,</b> it is understandably going to take extra effort to assure nobody gets hurt. Doing so, of course, costs money - a lot of money to pay for labor and hardware which is attempting to assure nothing will go wrong. Sophisticated designs, with doubly- or triply-redundant systems, extensive testing to verify those systems, and numerous engineering test units built to learn and evolve a hardware design, all drive the cost and time required to implement. Human spaceflight is an expensive business because of the exceptional system complexity and levels of assurance required for human space travel. What about missions that do not involve human spaceflight? What about missions whose potential failure will not take a human life, whose costs are small and whose urgency and importance are limited by design? A portfolio consisting of this type of mission can be designed to be risk tolerant, not requiring large expenditures to guarantee against failure. With the money saved, the number of missions that can be executed within the portfolio grows, or the total cost of the portfolio can be reduced. The NASA LCROSS mission is a pathfinder example of a low-cost, quick turn-around mission which struck a balance on mission risk, while accomplishing big objectives, like defining how we understand the Moon...|$|E
