40|$|The rapid {{increase}} {{and the need}} for more sustainable buildings has led researchers and engineers to find a new way to construct buildings which can be offered more cheaply and sustainably. However, the adoption of new technology in the construction of buildings requires intense study of the influential factors that can affect the demand for new buildings. This research investigates the factors which have significant impact on demand for fibre cement technology. On the basis of questionnaire data analysis, this research process developed a model of system dynamics which showed the relationships between influential factors and demand, as well as finding new relationships between these factors. After modelling the factors of cost, advertising, education and awareness, the availability of classic buildings and specifications of <b>fibre</b> cement <b>buildings</b> are shown to be important factors in affecting demand for <b>fibre</b> cement <b>buildings</b> and vice versa. On the other hand, factors such as population, number of couples in households, availability of building land and standard of living have an important effect on demand, while demand has no impact on these factors. Therefore, these influential factors can help construction companies and contractors to enhance the demand for their newly developed <b>buildings.</b> <b>Fibre</b> cement <b>buildings</b> are cheap, attractive and resistant to fire and humidity, can be assembled, disassembled and then reassembled. These features can {{play an important role in}} attracting and satisfying customers for such buildings...|$|R
