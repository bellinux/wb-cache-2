He cites the LaMacchia case, which dealt with charges of copyright infringement of software subsequently dismissed.

5|$|Once a queen has {{excavated}} a chamber, {{she will}} lay around 20 eggs that develop into larvae {{in less than}} a month. These eggs take 44 to 61 days to fully develop and emerge as adults. Mature nests range in size, from a few hundred to over 300,000 workers. Most colonies are monogyne, meaning it only has a single queen, but some colonies can have as many as four. Oligogynous colonies also exist, in which multiple queens are present, but they are tolerated equally by workers birthed from different mothers and antagonism exists among queens. Brood <b>discrimination</b> <b>is</b> known based on recognition of kin, and queens will look after their own brood and neglect other brood laid by different queens. Queens display intolerance to each other when the first generation of workers is present, and the queens will separate from each other once the colony grows to a certain size.|$|E

In Experiments 1 and 2, these <b>discriminations</b> <b>were</b> preceded by training in which A and B were continuously reinforced and X and Y were partially reinforced. Consistent with the Pearce and Hall (1980) model, the results showed that the AY/AX <b>discrimination</b> <b>was</b> solved more readily than the AY/BY discrimination. In Experiments 3 and 4, the <b>discriminations</b> <b>were</b> preceded by feature-positive training in which trials with AX and BY signaled food but trials with X and Y did not.

Two 3 D shape <b>discrimination</b> tasks <b>were</b> used to distinguish between these possibilities: a within-shape task and a between-shape task. Disparity thresholds were larger when discriminating within the same shape than when discriminating between shapes. More importantly, within-shape <b>discriminations</b> <b>were</b> dependent on the pedestal disparity (distance from fixation) whereas between-shape <b>discriminations</b> <b>were</b> not. The results suggest that a mechanism sensitive to higher-order disparity derivatives can achieve discrimination between different 3 D shapes...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} investigated successive discrimination {{learning in}} rats. Of central interest was {{the influence of}} the interval between the reinforced stimulus (S+) and the reinforcer (shock) on discriminative performance. Experiment 1 demonstrated that when shock immediately followed the S+ the <b>discrimination</b> <b>was</b> formed rapidly—subjects quickly came to show conditioned responding exclusively during the S+. However, when there was a 30 -s trace interval between the S+ and shock the <b>discrimination</b> <b>was</b> only poorly formed, and conditioned responding occurred on both S+ and nonreinforced (S−) trials. In Experiment 2 subjects received concurrent training on a visual and an auditory discrimination. For one <b>discrimination</b> the S+ <b>was</b> immediately followed by shock and for the second <b>discrimination</b> there <b>was</b> a trace interval between the reinforced cue and shock. The former <b>discrimination</b> <b>was</b> acquired more readily than the latter.

40|$|Background: Emerging {{evidence}} suggests that exposure to <b>discrimination</b> may <b>be</b> associated with atherosclerosis in African-American women, although {{research in this area}} focused on short-term rather than chronic exposure to discriminatory events. Methods: We examined the relationship between chronic exposure to multiple types of discrimination (self-reported and averaged over 5 years) and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in a sample of 181 middle-aged African-American women. <b>Discrimination</b> <b>was</b> assessed at each time point, and the presence/absence of CAC was assessed at the fifth annual follow-up examination by electron beam tomography. We hypothesized that chronic <b>discrimination</b> would <b>be</b> more strongly associated with CAC than recent discrimination and that racial/ethnic <b>discrimination</b> would <b>be</b> more strongly associated with CAC than other types of discrimination. Results: Chronic exposure to <b>discrimination</b> <b>was</b> significantly associated with the presence of CAC in unadjusted logistic regression analyses (p. 007) and after adjustment for demographics (p. 01), standard cardiovascular risk factors (p. 02), and Body Mass Index (BMI) (p. 05). In contrast, recent <b>discrimination</b> <b>was</b> only marginally associated with the presence of CAC in both unadjusted (p. 06) and fully adjusted logistic regression models (p. 08). Persistent exposure to racial/ethnic <b>discrimination</b> <b>was</b> not more strongly associated with CAC compared with other types of discrimination in either unadjusted or adjusted models. Conclusion: Chronic exposure to <b>discrimination</b> may <b>be</b> an important risk factor for early coronary calcification in African-American women. This association appears to be driven by exposure to discrimination from multiple sources, rather than exposure to racial/ethnic discrimination alone.
