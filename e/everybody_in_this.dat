500|$|... "Illuminati" [...] is a dance-pop {{song with}} brittle hits, blips and a buzz-saw break as its main instrumentation. Its sound was {{compared}} to that of [...] West's album Yeezus (2013). The song's lyrics discuss Illuminati conspiracy theories; it names celebrities who had also been accused of being part of the group, and religious imagery. Madonna sings, [...] "It's like <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> party's, shining like Illuminati". The song received favorable reviews from music critics, who commended West involvement with the track, and its ambitious sound and lyrics, while some chose it as one of the album's highlights. It charted in some European territories and on the Billboard Dance/Electronic Digital Songs. [...] Madonna performed the song with dancers strapped to tall, flexible poles as part of her Rebel Heart Tour (2015–16); it was considered one of the show's main highlights.|$|E
500|$|During another {{scene at}} the Snakehole Lounge, a drunken Leslie angrily yells to Ben, [...] "I just talked to <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> bar and nobody wants you here." [...] That line was written by Harris Wittels, who wrote past screenplays for other Parks and Recreation episodes. During the end credits, Andy sings a song he wrote for April called [...] "November," [...] which {{includes}} the lyrics, [...] "Let's spread our wings and fly on a date." [...] This is also a reference to [...] "Woman of the Year," [...] in which Andy explained every song he writes includes either the lyrics, [...] "Spread your wings and fly" [...] or [...] "You deserve to be a champion." [...] Schur, who wrote the words to [...] "November", said it was especially challenging working one of those phrases into a love song.|$|E
500|$|The fifth song, [...] "Illuminati", was {{inspired}} after Madonna learnt {{that she was}} considered {{as one of the}} Illuminati's members. She decided to research about the real Illuminati and then wrote the song. Lyrically it refers to the Illuminati conspiracy theory, the Egyptian pyramids, the Phoenix, the Age of Enlightenment, and the Eye of Providence among others, with the chorus lyrics: [...] "It's like <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> party is shining like Illuminati". According to Madonna, Kanye West, who produced the track, loved the melody and changed the composition adding his own spin to it. Minaj appears on the sixth track, [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna", where she raps, asking everybody to [...] "go hard or go home", while Madonna shouts lyrics like: [...] "I just want to have fun tonight, I wanna blow up this house tonight". Produced by Diplo and Sophie, the track has a tearing sound alongside the [...] "bleepy electro" [...] and [...] "churning dubstep" [...] composition. During the writing sessions, Minaj had to rewrite the lyrics until she could get the correct sentiment Madonna wanted. [...] "Hold Tight" [...] consists of an [...] "arresting" [...] chorus and a drum beat sound, described by Sam C. Mac of Slant Magazine as: [...] "innocuous, lyrically platitudinous pop that briefly works itself up into something exciting when it threatens to become a gospelized stomp". Track eight, [...] "Joan of Arc", is a ballad in which Madonna sings about the media scrutiny of her life, singing: [...] "Each time they take a photograph, I lose a part of me I can't get back". It also references the Roman Catholic saint of the same name. Madonna's hushed, vibrato-tinged vocals, and confessional lyrics in [...] "Joan of Arc", are enhanced by a new beat instrumentation that utilizes strings and acoustic guitars in the bridge.|$|E

60|$|They {{suggested}} {{the idea to}} the critics, and the critics thought it an excellent one, and said they would undertake the job with pleasure. One must say for the critics that they never shirk work. They will sit and criticise for eighteen hours a day, if necessary, or even, if quite unnecessary, for the matter of that. You can't give them too much to criticise. They will criticise everything and <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world. They will criticise everything in the next world, too, when they get there.

60|$|One wishes our friends, the critics, would grasp {{this simple}} truth, and leave off clamoring for the impossible, and being shocked {{because they do}} not get it. When a new book is written, the high-class critic opens it with {{feelings}} of faint hope, tempered by strong conviction of coming disappointment. As he pores over the pages, his brow darkens with virtuous indignation, and his lip curls with the Godlike contempt that the exceptionally great critic ever feels for <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world, who is not yet dead. Buoyed up by a touching, but totally fallacious, belief that he is performing a public duty, and {{that the rest of the}} community is waiting in breathless suspense to learn his opinion of the work in question, before forming any judgment concerning it themselves, he, nevertheless, wearily struggles through about a third of it. Then his long-suffering soul revolts, and he flings it aside with a cry of despair.|$|E

60|$|This natural {{solution}} of doubts and difficulties arrested all further inquiry. Generally speaking, {{the position of}} Endymion in his new life was satisfactory. He was regular and assiduous in his attendance at office, was popular with his comrades, and was cherished by his chief, who had even invited him to dinner. His duties were certainly at present mechanical, but they were associated with an interesting profession; and humble as was his lot, {{he began to feel}} the pride of public life. He continued to be a regular guest at Joe's, and was careful not to seem to avoid the society of his fellow-clerks in the evenings, for he had an instinctive feeling that it was as well they should not become acquainted with his circle in Warwick Street. And yet to him the attractions of that circle became daily more difficult to resist. And often when he was enduring the purgatory of the Divan, listening to the snarls of St. Barbe over the shameful prosperity of <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world except the snarler, or perhaps went half-price to the pit of Drury Lane with the critical Trenchard, he was, in truth, restless and absent, and his mind was in another place, indulging in visions which he did not care to analyse, but which were very agreeable.|$|E

To begin with, I shall never {{undertake}} any work that I do not think will pay--that is, without an adequate guarantee, or in the capacity of a simple agent; and my own ten per cent will be the first charge on the profits; then the author's ten. Of course, if I speculate in a book, and buy it out and out, subject to the risks, the case will be different. But with a net ten per cent certain, I am, like people in any other line of business, quite prepared to be satisfied; and, upon those terms, I expect to become the publisher of all the best writers in England, and I also expect that any good writer will in future {{be able to make a}} handsome income out of his work.

6000|$|<b>Everybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> {{room has}} {{been taught to}} pray daily, 'Thy kingdom come.' Now, if we hear a man swear in the streets, we think it very wrong, and say he 'takes God's name in vain.' But there's a twenty times worse way of taking His name in vain, than that. It is to ask God for what we don't want. He doesn't like that sort of prayer. If you don't want a thing, don't ask for it: such asking is the worst mockery of your King you can mock Him with; the {{soldiers}} striking Him {{on the head with}} the reed was nothing to that. If you do not wish for His kingdom, don't pray for it. But if you do, you must do more than pray for it; you must work for it. And, to work for it, you must know what it is: we have all prayed for it many a day without thinking. Observe, it is a kingdom that is to come to us; we are not to go to it. Also, it is not to be a kingdom of the dead, but of the living. Also, it is not to come all at once, but quietly; nobody knows how. 'The kingdom of God cometh not with observation.' Also, it is not to come outside of us, but in the hearts of us: 'the kingdom of God is within you.' And, being within us, it is not a thing to be seen, but to be felt; and though it brings all substance of good with it, it does not consist in that: 'the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost:' joy, that is to say, in the holy, healthful, and helpful Spirit. Now, if we want to work for this kingdom, and to bring it, and enter into it, there's just one condition to be first accepted. You must enter it as children, or not at all; 'Whosoever will not receive it as a little child shall not enter therein.' And again, 'Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of heaven.' ...|$|E
60|$|The Babylonian, Assyrian, Median, and Persian monarchies {{must have}} poured out seas {{of blood in}} their formation, and in their destruction. The armies and fleets of Xerxes, their numbers, the glorious stand made against them, and the unfortunate event of all his mighty preparations, are known to <b>everybody.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> expedition, {{draining}} half Asia of its inhabitants, he led an army of about two millions to be slaughtered, and wasted by a thousand fatal accidents, {{in the same place}} where his predecessors had before by a similar madness consumed the flower of so many kingdoms, and wasted the force of so extensive an empire. It is a cheap calculation to say, that the Persian empire, in its wars against the Greeks and Scythians, threw away at least four millions of its subjects; to say nothing of its other wars, and the losses sustained in them. These were their losses abroad; but the war was brought home to them, first by Agesilaus, and afterwards by Alexander. I have not, in this retreat, the books necessary to make very exact calculations; nor is it necessary to give more than hints to one of your lordship's erudition. You will recollect his uninterrupted series of success. You will run over his battles. You will call to mind the carnage which was made. You will give a glance at the whole, and you will agree with me, that to form this hero no less than twelve hundred thousand lives must have been sacrificed; but no sooner had he fallen himself a sacrifice to his vices, than a thousand breaches were made for ruin to enter, and give the last hand to this scene of misery and destruction. His kingdom was rent and divided; which served to employ the more distinct parts to tear each other to pieces, and bury the whole in blood and slaughter. The kings of Syria and of Egypt, the kings of Pergamus and Macedon, without intermission worried each other for above two hundred years; until at last a strong power, arising in the west, rushed in upon them and silenced their tumults, by involving all the contending parties in the same destruction. It is little to say, that the contentions between the successors of Alexander depopulated {{that part of the world}} of at least two millions.|$|E
