5|$|Eight centimeters {{wide and}} five tall, the Gevninge {{eyepiece}} was molded from bronze and then gilded. An oval eye opening is overlain by a sculpted eyebrow with grooves forming individual hairs, while grooves around the oval may represent eyelashes. The {{top and the}} bottom of the fragment each have three holes, presumably used to attach it to the helmet; the top three may have attached it to the helmet cap, the bottom three to some form of <b>face</b> <b>protection</b> such as a facemask or camail.|$|E
25|$|<b>Face</b> <b>protection</b> is {{mentioned}} {{at least three}} times in the literature of the Komnenian period, and probably indicates face-covering mail, leaving only the eyes visible. This would accord with accounts of such protection in earlier military writings, which describe double-layered mail covering the face, and later illustrations. Such a complete camail could be raised off the face by hooking up the mail to studs on the brow of the helmet. However, the remains of metal ‘face-mask’ anthropomorphic visors were discovered {{at the site of the}} Great Palace of Constantinople in association with a coin of Manuel I Komnenos. Such masks were found on some ancient Roman helmets and on contemporary helmets found in grave sites associated with Kipchak Turks from the North Pontic Steppe. The existence of these masks could indicate that the references to face-protection in Byzantine literature describe the use of this type of solid visor.|$|E
25|$|Bascinets, {{other than}} great bascinets, could be worn beneath a great helm. However, only those without <b>face</b> <b>protection,</b> {{or those with}} the close fitting bretache, could be worn in this manner. The great helm afforded {{a high degree of}} protection, but at the cost of very {{restricted}} vision and agility. The lighter types of bascinet gave less protection but allowed greater freedom of movement and better vision. The practicality of a man-at-arms being able to take off a great helm during a battle, if he wanted to continue fighting wearing just a bascinet, is unclear. By the mid 14th century the great helm was probably largely relegated to tournament use. However, Henry V of England is reputed to have worn a great helm over a bascinet at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. He was recorded as receiving a blow to the head during the battle, which damaged his helmet; the double protection afforded by wearing two helmets may have saved his life.|$|E

One part of the text refers to the implementation of integrated conservation in Greece, with the program for conservation of the historic Athenian quarter of Plaka as an example. Finally an effort is made to develop a general approach to the problems <b>facing</b> <b>protection</b> and conservation of monuments, especially the problem of air pollution...|$|R

2500|$|Meanwhile, in a November 15, 1953 {{game against}} the 49ers, Otto Graham took an elbow from linebacker Art Michalik that put a gash on his face {{requiring}} 15 stitches. Graham's helmet was fitted with a clear plastic mask and he was sent back on the field. While the use of face masks was not unheard-of – Y.A. Tittle was using one that season as he nursed a fractured cheekbone – the injury contributed to their development. Brown is often credited with inventing and patenting the single-bar face mask. Riddell, a sports equipment manufacturer, claims the [...] "bar tubular" [...] mask was invented by G.E.

2500|$|Such boar-shapes {{may have}} been like those on the Sutton Hoo helmet, {{terminating}} {{at the ends of}} the eyebrows and looking out over the cheek guards.

(The two helmets would not have been identical, however; Beowulf's was further described as [...] "encircled in lordly links"——a possible reference to the type of chain mail on the Valsgärde 6 and 8 helmets that provided neck and <b>face</b> <b>protection.)</b> The other style of boar adornment, mentioned three times in the poem, appears to refer to helmets with a freestanding boar atop the crest. When Hrothgar laments the death of his close friend Æschere, he recalls how Æschere was [...] "my right hand man when the ranks clashed and our boar-crests had to take a battering in the line of action." [...] These crests were probably more similar to those on the Benty Grange and Wollaston helmets, a detached boar found in Guilden Morden, and those seen in contemporary imagery on the Vendel 1 and Valsgärde 7 helmets and on the Torslunda plates (...)

30|$|These {{factors have}} {{motivated}} {{the development of}} new protection concepts that are supported by WAM. The varied nature of the challenges <b>facing</b> <b>protection</b> has meant that these new concepts cover a broad range of complexity and ambition. Examples include novel system integrity protection schemes (SIPS) that can deploy a wide range of far reaching actions to prevent a cascading failure, adaptive system protection (e.g. adaptive under frequency load shedding), supervisory schemes that improve the security of existing backup protection, and methods that do not change the behavior of system protection but do enhance our understanding of it (e.g. alarming system operators to the risk of false penetration of relay characteristics). Recent work has begun to focus not only on developing new concepts but also on the practical realization of these concepts, e.g. work has addressed the use of the IEEE 1588 std for substation synchronization as part of the Guizhou-Duyun WAP project in Guizhou province China [14].|$|R
