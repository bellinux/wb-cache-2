5|$|In August 2016, Microsoft {{released}} a refreshed Xbox One model, Xbox One S, {{which has a}} streamlined design, native support for 4K video playback and upscaling, and HDR10 high-dynamic-range color. It was praised for its smaller size, its on-screen visual improvements, and its lack of an <b>external</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> but its regressions such as {{the lack of a}} native Kinect port were noted. A high-end model, Xbox One X, was unveiled in June 2017 for release in November, which features major hardware upgrades focused on enabling games to be rendered at 4K resolution.|$|E
5|$|In June 2009, {{many of the}} world's largest {{mobile phone}} {{manufacturers}} signed an EC-sponsored Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), agreeing to make most data-enabled mobile phones marketed in the European Union compatible with a common <b>External</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Supply</b> (common EPS). The EU's common EPS specification (EN 62684:2010) references the USB Battery Charging Specification and {{is similar to the}} GSMA/OMTP and Chinese charging solutions. In January 2011, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) released its version of the (EU's) common EPS standard as IEC 62684:2011.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the guns}} seen in the film and on the film's poster was an AMT Longslide pistol {{modified}} by Ed Reynolds from SureFire to include a laser sight. Both non-functioning and functioning versions of the prop were created. At the time the movie was made, diode lasers were not available; {{because of the high}} power requirement, the helium–neon laser in the sight used an <b>external</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> that Schwarzenegger had to activate manually. Reynolds states that his only compensation for the project was promotional material for the film.|$|E
5|$|Some USB devices {{require more}} power than is {{permitted}} by the specifications for a single port. This is common for external hard and optical disc drives, and generally for devices with motors or lamps. Such devices can use an <b>external</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> which is allowed by the standard, or use a dual-input USB cable, one input of which is used for power and data transfer, the other solely for power, which makes the device a non-standard USB device. Some USB ports and external hubs can, in practice, supply more power to USB devices than required by the specification but a standard-compliant device may not depend on this.|$|E

An {{estimated}} 2W of power are used while the older versions of console are {{in standby mode}} giving a yearly usage of approximately 17.5kWh. The new version uses around 0.5W while in standby.

25|$|Chromecast {{devices are}} dongles that are powered by {{connecting}} the device's micro-USB port to an <b>external</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> or a USB port. Video-capable Chromecasts plug into the HDMI port of a high-definition television or monitor, while the audio-only model outputs sound through its integrated 3.5 millimeter audio jack/mini-TOSLINK socket. By default, Chromecasts {{connect to the}} Internet through a Wi-Fi connection to the user's local network; a standalone USB power supply with an Ethernet port, introduced in July 2015 for US$15, allows for a wired connection.|$|E
25|$|The {{power plant}} is {{connected}} to the 330kV and 750kV electrical grid. The block has two electrical generators connected to the 750kV grid by a single generator transformer. The generators are connected to their common transformer by two switches in series. Between them, the unit transformers are connected to supply power to the power plant's own systems; each generator can therefore be connected to the unit transformer to power the plant, or to the unit transformer and the generator transformer to also feed power to the grid. The 330kV line is normally not used, and serves as an <b>external</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> connected by a station transformer to the power plant's electrical systems. The plant can be powered by its own generators, or get power from the 750kV grid through the generator transformer, or from the 330kV grid via the station transformer, or from the other power plant block via two reserve busbars. In case of total external power loss, the essential systems can be powered by diesel generators. Each unit transformer {{is connected to}} two 6kV main power boards, A and B (e.g. 7A, 7B, 8A, 8B for generators 7 and 8), powering principal non-essential drivers and connected to transformers for the 4kV main power and the 4kV reserve busbar. The 7A, 7B, and 8B boards are also connected to the three essential power lines (namely for the coolant pumps), each also having its own diesel generator. In case of a coolant circuit failure with simultaneous loss of external power, the essential power can be supplied by the spinning down turbogenerators for about 45–50 seconds, during which time the diesel generators should start up. The generators are started automatically within 15 seconds at loss of off-site power.|$|E
500|$|Between 1983 and 2007, Naim {{had only}} one {{integrated}} amplifier available, although the product has seen several guises.

5000|$|Ease of {{replacement}} - <b>Power</b> <b>supplies</b> {{are more prone}} to failure than other circuitry due to their exposure to power spikes and their internal generation of waste heat. <b>External</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> can be replaced quickly by a user without the need to have the powered device repaired.|$|R
50|$|<b>External</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> {{were also}} used in later Apple {{computers}} such as the Power Mac G4 Cube and Mac Mini. Joint efforts with speaker manufacturers (originally Bose, but later Harman Kardon) have become common for several Apple computers.|$|R
500|$|Confirming Naim's upgrade {{philosophy}} – {{the belief}} and objective that incremental improvements to their equipment can be gained with {{improving the quality}} of the power source, Martin Colloms of Hi-fi Critic concluded about adding an <b>external</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> to the top-of-the-range Supernait: ... simply transformed the sound quality, immediately bringing a substantial and obvious improvement.

500|$|The Rhodes piano {{features}} a keyboard {{with a similar}} layout to a traditional acoustic piano, but some models contain 73 keys instead of 88. The touch and action of the keyboard {{is designed to be}} as close to a piano as possible. Pressing a key results in a hammer striking a thin metal rod called a tine connected to a larger [...] "tone bar". The whole [...] "tone generator assembly" [...] acts as a tuning fork, the tone bar reinforcing and extending the vibrations of the tine. A pickup sits opposite the tine, picking up its vibrations and inducing an electric current in a similar manner to an electric guitar. The basic mechanical act of hitting tines does not need an <b>external</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> and a Rhodes will make sound even when not plugged into an amplifier, though like an unplugged electric guitar the sound will be weak.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{highlights}} the key {{findings of the}} EuP Preparatory Study on <b>external</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> and battery chargers. This study, being one of currently 14 such product group specific studies, serves as the technical, economical and environmental analysis {{which will be the}} basis to draft implementing measures. Results of this study are due in December 06. The analysis comprises in detail the definition of the product category, a market analysis, aspects of user behaviour and related barriers for ecodesign, a systems analysis, an environmental assessment of the current market for <b>external</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> and battery chargers, and an in-depth technical analysis on improvement potentials. The improvement options have to consider life cycle costs and especially the point of least life cycle costs for the consumer, whereas "best available technology" might serve as a promotional target under EuP. The analysis is based on key applications, such as <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> for mobile phones, DECT phones, and laptops and takes into account all major technical parameters relevant for this whole product spectrum. The approach used throughout this study is the MEEuP methodology, which also prescribes the way, how the life cycle oriented environmental assessment has to be carried out. The results will name technical options, which are feasible and available in the market already today to improve the environmental performance of <b>external</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> and battery chargers, taking into account a thorough balancing of life cycle impacts. As this EuP preparatory study and the study on street lighting {{are going to be the}} first ones, which come up with results, it is expected, that the outcomes give a good orientation what matters under EuP in general...|$|R
