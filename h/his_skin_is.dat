5|$|Krishna is {{represented}} in the Indian traditions in many ways, but with some common features. His iconography typically depicts him with black, dark, or blue skin, like Vishnu. However, ancient and medieval reliefs and stone-based arts depict him in the natural color of the material out {{of which he is}} formed, both in India and in southeast Asia. In some texts, <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> poetically described as the color of Jambul (Jamun, a purple-colored fruit).|$|E
5|$|His {{eyes are}} open, and <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> unblemished. The cross is painted with deep blue paint, perhaps evoking an eternal or {{timeless}} sky. This evocation, {{not present in}} the main crucified figure, {{was known as the}} Christus triumphans ("Triumphant Christ"), and for contemporary– especially Franciscan– taste lacked verisimilitude, as it bore little relation to the actual suffering likely endured during a crucifixion, and overly distanced the divine from the human aspect of Christ. From about 1240, painters favoured the Christus patiens ("Suffering Christ") style: a saviour who shared the burden and pain of humanity. The Santa Croce Crucifix is one of the earliest and best known examples of the type.|$|E
25|$|President {{and co-founder}} of Oop!. Primarily business-minded, {{he has been a}} millionaire three times over with various (eventually failed) projects. He devotes his time to seeking venture capital for the startup company. Ethan's {{personality}} is diametrically opposed to the other characters, in part because of his relative lack of technical knowledge. He suffers from bad dandruff and <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> pocked by scars from procedures to remove cancerous growths.|$|E
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> gold, <b>his</b> real {{mood was}} intense. She revered {{him for a}} moment.|$|R
60|$|Barbara {{lifted her}} head and studied him. His face <b>was</b> pinched, <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> very white and wet. Her eyes filled and she was moved by tender pity.|$|R
60|$|He got up, but {{his clothes}} {{gathered}} some slime {{from the rock}} and <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> stained by soil and moss. Barbara {{looked at him with}} a twinkle.|$|R
25|$|There, Bilbo becomes {{friends with}} Bard (André Sogliuzzo), {{captain of the}} town guard, and {{performs}} several tasks for him, including finding his Black Arrow, which {{is said to have}} special powers. The party then head towards the nearby Lonely Mountain. They find the secret entrance, but Bilbo is dismayed to learn the dwarves have no idea how to kill Smaug. As such, he sneaks into Smaug's lair {{to try to find a}} weak spot. Bilbo tricks Smaug (James Horan) into showing him his stomach, which is coated in diamonds, except for one small spot, where <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> exposed. Bilbo leaves, telling the dwarves of Smaug's vulnerability, and is overheard by a nearby thrush, who heads towards Lake-town. Furious that he has been outwitted by Bilbo, Smaug bursts from the mountain and attacks Lake-town. However, the thrush tells Bard of the exposed skin, and Bard fires the Black Arrow into Smaug's chest, killing him.|$|E
25|$|In Ikari Warriors, Ralf's attire {{was based}} on Rambo. He wore green pants, a red {{headband}} and a belt full of bullets. In the first game from The King of Fighters series, he wore jeans and a T-shirt, along with a military vest and a red bandanna. In The King of Fighters '99 is sightly changed with green jeans, red gloves {{and he did not}} wear the belt. In The King of Fighters 2000, his outfit is once again modified but with darker colors from all his clothes. His attire from Ikari appears as alternate outfit for the character in the first Maximum Impact game. In , Ralf retains his 2003 outfit but with a red jacket. His Armored Ralf version from the same game {{is very different from the}} original Ralf, as <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> darker and his hair is lighter. He additionally sports a green jacket, military pants, a white T-shirt and a green headband instead of his red bandana. He was also given green protectors in his hands which have spikes. The additional outfits from the common Ralf are cosplays from Marco Rossi from the Metal Slug series and Jack Turner from the Art of Fighting series.In The King of Fighters XII, Ralf becomes bulkier and wears a dark olive military vest over a pair of dark olive cargo pants. His attire in The King of Fighters XIV is a mix of his 99 and XII outfits, with a white tank top and green camouflage cargo pants. His body also sports light green war paint in this.|$|E
25|$|Freddy Krueger's {{physical}} appearance has remained largely consistent throughout the film series, although minor {{changes were made}} in subsequent films. He wears a striped red-and-green sweater (solid red sleeves in the original film), a dark brown fedora, his bladed glove, loose black trousers (brown in the original film), and worn work boots, {{in keeping with his}} blue collar background. <b>His</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> scarred and burned as a result of being burned alive by the parents of Springwood, and he has no hair at all on his head as it presumably all burned off. In the original film, only Freddy's face was burned, while the scars have spread to the rest of his body from the second film onwards. His blood is occasionally a dark, oily color, or greenish in hue when he is in the Dreamworld. In the original film, Freddy remains in the shadows and under lower light much longer than he does in the later pictures. In the second film, there are some scenes where Freddy is shown without his bladed glove, and instead with the blades protruding from the tips of his fingers. As the films began to emphasize the comedic, wise-cracking aspect of the character, he began to don various costumes and take on other forms, such as dressing as a waiter or wearing a Superman inspired version of his sweater with a cape (The Dream Child), appearing as a video game sprite (Freddy's Dead), a giant snake-like creature (Dream Warriors), and a hookah smoking caterpillar (Freddy vs. Jason).|$|E

5000|$|... "In ‘Nenjam Marappadillai,’ {{he plays}} a really old man...the makeup would take hours together, but he would <b>be</b> {{extremely}} patient. <b>His</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> flawless and almost pink...he took great care of his health." ...|$|R
500|$|New York {{plastic surgeon}} Dr. Pamela Lipkin, {{who has never}} treated Jackson or {{reviewed}} his medical records, said, [...] "when {{you look at the}} other features, the skin bleaching sort of goes along with what I think was his quest for beauty, so I have to wonder what came first? Vitiligo or lighter skin?" [...] Noting that Jackson had even skin tone when he was younger, Lipkin's interpretation was that [...] "probably he's trying to look Caucasian: <b>His</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> whiter. His nose is getting thinner every six months. His lips are getting thinner. His eyebrows are getting higher. His eyes are getting wider every time. His cheekbones are getting bigger." ...|$|E
500|$|Conway {{described}} the panel as indicating [...] "an astonishing depth of psychological insight" [...] {{for an artist}} not yet 20 years old. In its simple design and detail it shares many of the characteristics of, and is a key precursor to, Dürer's mature work. He [...] portrayed his father again in 1497, when the older man would have been around 70. He has aged noticeably in the intervening seven years: <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> saggier, the wrinkles deeper and more pronounced. In this later portrait Dürer seems at pains to convey these effects of ageing, which are all too evident on his father's face. According to Brion, his eyes have lost their [...] "distant, mystic" [...] appearance and now seem less contented. Conway agrees, seeing traces of haggardly agitation, but holds that the two paintings convey a similar overall highly favourable and compassionate impression of the man.|$|E
500|$|Dürer's father wears a dark shirt, russet {{coat and}} a black hat lined with fur. <b>His</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> slack at the mouth and chin, and he has small, {{intelligent}} eyes, which Von Fircks describes as [...] "dark and serious". Their curves echo those of the heavy lids beneath. His eyes are lined with crow's feet and shadowed with brown hatched paint. His facial features are built from brush strokes more typical of drawing than painting—at this young age Dürer was a far more skilled draughtsman than painter. Technical analysis carried out in 2013 by Dagmar Hirschfelder revealed a detailed background which was over-painted by the artist. The abandoned interior space consisted of a corner of a room with an arched window looking out to a countryside view. This type of interior {{can be traced to}} the Netherlandish tradition, and is rare in German portraiture of the period.|$|E
6000|$|The old man kindly {{answered}} them: [...] 'it {{might be}} Japhet, {{it might be}} Shem, [...] Or it might <b>be</b> Ham (though <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> dark), [...] Whereas it is Noah, commanding the Ark.|$|R
60|$|As {{the fellow}} drew closer, Carthoris halted to await his coming. He {{knew that the}} man was unarmed, and that he was {{apparently}} a Lotharian, for <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> white and <b>his</b> hair auburn.|$|R
50|$|In Golem form, Jacob was hulky {{humanoid}} of 3 meters height. <b>His</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> hard as stone, {{giving him}} a good degree of invulnerability. His strength was greater than Captain America's but less than Namor's.|$|R
500|$|In {{the video}} games, the Master Chief is rarely seen without his armor. In-game cutscenes tease the character's face, but never reveal it; for example, {{at the end}} of Halo: Combat Evolved, the Chief removes his helmet, but camera {{movement}} hides his head. Bungie says this helps the gamer fully assume his character. At the end of Halo 4, Master Chief's eyes are briefly shown when he removes his armor and helmet. One physical description of the adult Master Chief comes from the novels. During a briefing scene in Halo: The Flood, the Chief is described as tall with short hair, serious eyes, and strong features. <b>His</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> [...] "too white", a consequence of spending {{most of his time in}} his armor. The Master Chief stands about sevenfeet (2.13m) tall and weighs 1,000 pounds (450kg) in armor; without it, he stands sixfeet, seveninches (2m) tall and weighs 287pounds (130kg).|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Somebody That I Used to Know" [...] was {{directed}} and produced by Australian artist Natasha Pincus. It shows Gotye and Kimbra naked throughout the clip, {{and as they}} sing, <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> gradually painted into the backdrop via stop motion animation. In the director's cut, it features concealed nudity. The director's cut was never posted. The painting used in the video's background, painted by Howard Clark, {{is based on a}} 1980s artwork created by Gotye's father, Frank de Backer, who also designed the cover art for the related album, Making Mirrors. Emma Hack, an Australian artist and skin illustrator based in Adelaide, was hired by Pincus to work on the body paintings for Gotye and Kimbra. Melbourne Scenic Artist Howard Clark painted the backdrop. According to Hack, it took more than 23 hours to paint both Gotye and Kimbra to fit with Howard's background. Their painting symbolises their combined relationship.|$|E
500|$|Even as Macunaíma {{changed the}} nature of Brazilian {{literature}} in an instant—Albuquerque calls it [...] "the cornerstone text of Brazilian Modernism"—the inner conflict in the novel was a strong part of its influence. [...] Modernismo, as Andrade depicted it, was formally tied to the innovations of recent European literature and based on the productive meeting of cultural forces in Brazil's diverse population; but it was fiercely nationalistic, based in large part on distinguishing Brazil's culture from the world and on documenting the damage caused by the lingering effects of colonial rule. [...] At the same time, the complex inner life of its hero suggests themes little explored in earlier Brazilian literature, which critics have taken to refer back to Andrade himself. [...] While Macunaíma is not autobiographical in the strict sense, it clearly reflects and refracts Andrade's own life. [...] Andrade was a mulatto; his parents were landowners but were in no sense a part of Brazil's Portuguese pseudo-aristocracy. [...] Some critics have paralleled Andrade's race and family background to the interaction between categories of his character Macunaíma. [...] Macunaíma's body itself is a composite: <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> darker than that of his fellow tribesmen, and {{at one point in the}} novel, he has an adult's body and a child's head. [...] He himself is a wanderer, never belonging to any one place.|$|E
50|$|<b>His</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> not broken, a black mark {{about the}} size of a small plate was the only visible injury. His watch was found flattened, with its hands {{pointing}} to the very second at which he received the fatal blow.|$|R
60|$|All day Carol watched Olaf's {{strength}} oozing. He was emaciated. His ribs were grim clear lines, <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> clammy, <b>his</b> pulse was feeble but terrifyingly rapid. It beat--beat--beat in a drum-roll of death. Late {{that afternoon}} he sobbed, and died.|$|R
50|$|Pimple (George Pie) is {{the muscle}} of the 'Toads and prefers to fight instead of talk. Pimple {{is the largest}} 'Toad. He wears spiked black kneepads and spiked black arm braces. Early artwork {{depicted}} him wearing a spiked black belt, {{but he was never}} seen wearing this belt in any of the games and later artwork eliminated the belt. According to his profile in the arcade Battletoads, he stands at a height of 7'4". Pimple's skin has changed in appearance a few times {{over the course of the}} series. He began with a medium shade of green, just like the other two 'Toads, and appears that way on the original box art. In the first game itself <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> a darker shade of green, matching Rash but not Zitz. <b>His</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> later changed to a light tan before finally being presented with a brown color for <b>his</b> <b>skin,</b> which <b>is</b> now considered <b>his</b> official <b>skin</b> color. He appears with his current color in Battletoads & Double Dragon and the arcade Battletoads arcade game.|$|R
2500|$|Like all {{the vampires}} in the Twilight series, Edward is {{described}} as being impossibly beautiful. At various points in the series, Bella compares him to the mythical Greek god Adonis. <b>His</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> [...] "like marble"—very pale, ice cold, and sparkles in the sunlight. She describes his facial features as being perfect and angular—high cheekbones, strong jawline, a straight nose, and full lips. His hair, which is always messy, retains the unusual bronze shade that he inherited in his human life from his biological mother. His eyes, once green, are now described as topaz. His appearance changes if he goes too long without feeding: his eyes darken, becoming almost black, and purple bruises appear beneath his eyes. Edward is 6'2", and has a slender but muscular body.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{is but a}} lad, {{being as}} he tells me between sixteen and seventeen; but you see <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> stained, and his face marked, so as {{to give him the}} {{appearance}} of age." ...|$|E

60|$|In {{attempting}} {{to express his}} gratification, the Chief of Police thrust out his right hand with such violence that <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> ruptured at the arm-pit and a stream of sawdust poured from the wound. He was a stuffed Chief of Police.|$|R
60|$|Before them stood {{a little}} man {{about the same size}} as the Munchkins. He was clothed all in green, from his head to his feet, and even <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> of a greenish tint. At his side was a large green box.|$|R
60|$|Jan {{was dressed}} in the short {{trousers}} and coat of the Martian farmer, a knotted rope tied around his waist, a hat on his head to keep off the sun. <b>His</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> dark, colored by dye until it was almost bronze.|$|R

But the lines in his face have deepened and his big features seem to have grown bigger.|$|E
60|$|Madeline {{saw the man}} she remembered, {{but with}} a {{singularly}} different aspect. <b>His</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> brown; <b>his</b> eyes were piercing and dark and steady; he carried himself erect; he seemed preoccupied, {{and there was not}} a trace of embarrassment in his manner.|$|R
50|$|In the Age of Apocalypse, Marco Delgado {{was one of}} the {{thousands}} of mutants that joined the armies of Apocalypse, eventually reaching the rank of Prelate.
