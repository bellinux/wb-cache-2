25|$|As can be noted, {{liability}} {{is generally}} not extended to the acts of independent contractors. Though such a distinction has been criticised, there are several circumstances in which an employer may be liable for the acts of contractors. If an employer commissions a tort, this will render the employer a <b>joint</b> <b>tortfeasor.</b> Additionally, where an employer is negligent in selecting a competent third party contractor, liability may be imposed. The broadest exception however is where a non-delegable duty is imposed upon an employer, either by statute or through common law, to prevent the harm of others. Where a duty is imposed by statute, either to carry out work in a certain way, or to take due care in carrying out work, then this is non-delegable. Common law duties may arise in several exceptional circumstances. One such is where an activity is being undertaken which is especially hazardous, and involves obvious risks of damage. This duty was recognised in Honeywill and Stein Ltd v Larkin Brothers Ltd, where photographers who negligently photographed {{the interior of a}} theatre set alight to the building. Their employers were found vicariously liable, as the dangerous methods of photography created a fire hazard. Additionally, where work is being undertaken on a highway, a non-delegable duty is created not to endanger any road users. Lastly, occupiers are liable in full where an independent contractor, through negligence, allows fire to spread to neighbouring land.|$|E

In May 2015, a panel of the Federal Circuit once again addressed the jury verdict and found that Limelight is not liable for direct infringement. The court (2-1) reiterated the prior Federal Circuit rule as to divided infringement: there must be [...] "a principal-agent relationship, a contractual relationship, or in circumstances in which parties work together in a joint enterprise functioning {{as a form of}} mutual agency." [...] One judge dissented, arguing that the majority ruling [...] "divorces patent law from mainstream legal principles by refusing to accept that § 271(a) includes <b>joint</b> <b>tortfeasor</b> liability" [...] and it [...] "creates a gaping hole in what for centuries has been recognized as an actionable form of infringement." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{defendant}} {{may also}} file a counterclaim against the plaintiff, or a cross-claim against a co-defendant, {{at any point}} before the trial begins, {{so long as the}} amount is within the jurisdictional limits of the GDC. Failure to file a counterclaim, however, does not effect a waiver of that counterclaim. A defendant may implead a third party anytime within ten days after service of process has been effected, up until the trial date, so long as the third party receives effective service of process. However, Virginia law prohibits a defendant from impleading a <b>joint</b> <b>tortfeasor</b> against whom the plaintiff is prohibited from recovering (such as plaintiff's employer in a negligent injury case, which would be covered by the state's workman's compensation). Virginia law does not recognize the doctrine of necessary and indispensable parties, so the inability to implead a party will not affect the court's jurisdiction over the case.|$|E

40|$|Loan {{agreements}} {{rely upon}} {{the existence of}} allowable indemnity for their justification and validity in the <b>joint</b> <b>tortfeasor</b> situation. If indemnity is allowed in a given situation, objections {{to the use of}} a loan agreement must be rejected. If, however, a suit for indemnity is not allowed between two joint tortfeasors, loan agreements should not allow such a result indirectly. Therefore, it may be concluded that the use of loan agreements in Nebraska in the <b>joint</b> <b>tortfeasor</b> situation will only be upheld when a suit for indemnification would also be upheld. Whether loan agreements are held to be valid or invalid in any given situation should not, however, preclude an injured plaintiff from receiving full compensation for his damages. In applying pro tanto reduction, the court in Tober v. Hampton justifiably held that any amount received under the invalid loan agreement should be deducted from any judgment rendered in a suit against the other <b>joint</b> <b>tortfeasor.</b> The court ruled inconsistently, though, in requiring the plaintiffs to pay back any money received in such a suit to the loaning <b>joint</b> <b>tortfeasor.</b> Since the loan agreement was held invalid, no repayment under it should have been required. As a result of this inconsistent combination of pro tanto reduction and mandatory repayment under an invalid loan agreement, the court 2 ̆ 7 s decision that the plaintiffs were not the real parties in interest seems erroneous...|$|E

40|$|The Paper, by {{consideration}} {{of the issue of}} authorisation, addresses a very practical development in commerce. Online copyright infringement is now not only about unauthorised uses of cinematograph films but has filtered down to become more prevalent amongst small to medium enterprises (SME), as some competitors embrace online trading by aggressively and often unlawfully, seeking market share. It is understandable that internet service providers (ISPs), as gatekeepers of internet traffic, may be considered as being more than a conduit of contravening conduct but not a <b>joint</b> <b>tortfeasor</b> involved in a common design. In between those extremes lies the concept of authorisation in copyright which has a long history in Australia since the Copyright Act 1905 (Cth).

40|$|Unlike the {{position}} in criminal law, there does not currently exist a general doctrine of accessory liability in civil law. Thus, a person may be liable as an accessory in equity for dishonestly assisting with a breach of trust, {{but there is no}} tort for dishonest assistance. Rather, one who participates in another 2 ̆ 7 s tort will only be liable if he is a <b>joint</b> <b>tortfeasor</b> acting pursuant to a common design with the primary tortfeasor. This article examines the reasons for this divergence and evaluates the case for their assimilation. It observes that, contrary to common perception, the scope of participatory liability in both sphers does not materially differ. It also concludes that the case for assimilation is not made out if the overarching principle for civil accessory liability is defined principally be reference to criminal concepts of complicity. Such an approach overlooks the fundamental distinctions between civil and criminal processes and threatens to extend civil liability beyond acceptable bounds...|$|E
40|$|With the {{new wave}} of claims against {{corporations}} for human rights violations – particularly in the context of aiding and abetting government abuse – there are unusually difficult problems of <b>joint</b> <b>tortfeasor</b> liability. In many circumstances, one tortfeasor – the corporation – is a deep-pocketed defendant, easily subject to suit, but only marginally involved in the unlawful conduct. Another tortfeasor – the sovereign – is a central player in the unlawful conduct, but, with limited exceptions, is immune from suit under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. A third tortfeasor – the low-level security personnel – accused of actually committing the atrocity, is beyond the jurisdictional reach of the forum and is an insolvent, judgment-proof defendant. How should an adjudicator apportion responsibility among these joint tortfeasors? Does it matter that the principal players are immune or insolvent, while the marginal player is not? In apportioning responsibility, is it relevant that one tortfeasor simply knew of the misconduct or was negligent with respect to its likely occurrence, although it did not intend for the violation to occur? Despite the saliency of these questions, international law does not provide the answers. These problems are only exacerbated by the fact that international law violations can be pursued in multiple arenas – in national courts, international tribunals, and international arbitral bodies. As a general rule, international tribunals will resolve the question of apportioning liability using public international law, while domestic courts will resolve the question by recourse to private international law, and arbitral panels will rely on the governing law of the contract. The approach for resolving questions of apportionment will differ in these contexts, although each will resort to domestic tort law in one way or another...|$|E

40|$|A Response to Ariel Porat, Private Production of Public Goods: Liability for Unrequested Benefits, 108 Mich. L. Rev. (2009). One of {{the more}} {{intriguing}} questions in tort law {{is the case of}} <b>joint</b> and several <b>tortfeasors</b> and the dilution-of-liability puzzle. When harm materializes and there are multiple potential tortfeasors, the law tends {{to limit the number of}} <b>joint</b> <b>tortfeasors,</b> focusing the final burden on a small number of actors. This limitation is achieved by several legal mechanisms, such as a no duty rule, a narrow interpretation of negligence, a restrictive implementation of the causal link (be it the but for test, the proximate cause test or the rule of intervening cause test), and a doctrine of remoteness of damage. Thus, in the typical accident example, if A, B, and C inflicted risk upon D, often times the tort system will filter out A and B and leave only C to carry the final burden. Ariel Porat 2 ̆ 7 s outline of the Expanded Duty of Restitution in his article, Private Production of Public Goods: Liability for Unrequested Benefits, provides an interesting and provocative solution to the dilution of liability puzzle...|$|R
5000|$|On {{appeal the}} {{defendants}} {{argued that they}} were not <b>joint</b> <b>tortfeasors</b> because they were not acting in consent. On the subject of negligence, defendant Simonson contended that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the finding on that score. The court ruled that Simonson did not however point out wherein the plaintiff's evidence was lacking. Defendant Tice on the other hand stated in his opening brief that [...] "we have decided not to argue the insufficiency of negligence on the part of defendant Tice." [...] The court noted that Tice neither conceded the point nor argued it in his petition for a hearing before the court and the court therefore did not address that issue further. Accordingly, in their view, neither was liable, and they could not be held jointly and severally liable (i.e., each defendant was liable for the full amount of damages).|$|R
40|$|In Royal Indemnity Co. v. Aetna Casualty 2 ̆ 6 Surety Co., the Nebraska Supreme Court was {{presented}} {{with an opportunity to}} determine whether there exists in Nebraska a right of equitable contribution between negligent judgment debtors after one such tortfeasor has discharged either the entire judgment or an amount exceeding his share of such liability. While Royal Indemnity represented only the third instance in the last half century in which this issue was addressed by the Nebraska Supreme Court, this modicum of Nebraska decisional law had, until this decision, been interpreted as prohibiting contribution among <b>joint</b> <b>tortfeasors.</b> Unlike a majority of American jurisdictions that have enacted laws allowing contribution in some degree among negligent tortfeasors, Nebraska has no such statute. The fact that Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s erstwhile rule prohibiting contribution had as its sole precursor the English common law required the Nebraska Supreme Court to review and analyze that common law foundation in addition to relevant Nebraska decisions. In so doing, the court, in an articulate decision authored by Justice Brodkey, placed its imprimatur on the ability of a negligent co-tortfeasor to proceed against other judgment-debtors and seek equitable contribution when he had been forced to discharge more than his 2 ̆ 2 proportional share 2 ̆ 2 of such liability. While recognizing the valid policy considerations that militate against allowing contribution among intentional or knowing wrongdoers, the court held that those policy considerations were unpersuasive when applied to <b>joint</b> <b>tortfeasors</b> whose liability was occasioned upon acts of mere negligence. This Note reviews the court 2 ̆ 7 s analysis in Royal Indemnity and highlights the basis the court used to determine that prior Nebraska case law had erroneously applied relevant common law principles. Finally, there is a discussion of several of the potential defenses that may be asserted to deny a right of contribution and whether such defenses should be sustained in light of the policy reasons underlying the Royal Indemnity decision...|$|R

25|$|If {{a person}} has wrongfully damaged to the body, health, reputation, liberty, credit, privacy or {{chastity}} of another, or to another's personality in a severe way, the injured person may claim a reasonable compensation in money even if such injury is not a purely pecuniary loss. If it was reputation that has been damaged, the injured person may also claim the taking of proper measures for the rehabilitation of his reputation. A person who, intentionally or negligently, has wrongfully damaged the rights of another is bound to compensate him for any injury arising therefrom. The same rule shall be applied when the injury is done intentionally in a manner against the rules of morals. A person, who violates a statutory provision enacted {{for the protection of}} others and therefore prejudice to others, is bound to compensate for the injury, except no negligence in his act can be proved.

50|$|The {{question}} of whether Internet service providers (ISPs) should {{be held liable for}} the actions of network users is unresolved. As to copyright, however, ISPs remain liable, in all territories, as primary, direct infringers of copyright for the copies they make on behalf of their customers, so the issue of additional secondary liability is less significant. An ISP's direct liability arises from the ISP's own actions, not the actions of another party. The confusion arises from the fact that two parties are directly liable in the usual case of internet infringement: the ISP and the ISP's customer. In legal terms, they are <b>joint</b> <b>tortfeasors.</b> This is because they both independently commit all of the acts necessary to establish liability under the copyright laws of most jurisdictions. In situations truly involving secondary liability, the party whose secondary liability is claimed has at least not committed one element required for an infringement action. This situation is not present in the usual ISP situation, as the ISP is always in the position of making copies (without authorization of the rights owner), so it is irrelevant that someone else has infringed the same copyright earlier in time. The ISP's liability is direct, not derivative. It is based on the ISP's own actions, not on someone else's.|$|R
2500|$|The {{only other}} way someone can have {{standing}} {{to challenge the}} constitutionality of a statute is if {{the existence of the}} statute would otherwise deprive him of a right or a privilege even if the statute itself would not apply to him. The Virginia Supreme Court made this point clear in the case of Martin v. Ziherl 607 S.E.2d 367 (Va. 2005). Martin and Ziherl were girlfriend and boyfriend and engaged in unprotected sexual intercourse when Martin discovered that Ziherl had infected her with herpes, even though he knew he was infected and did not inform her of this. She sued him for damages, but because (at the time the case was filed) it was illegal to commit [...] "fornication" [...] (sexual intercourse {{between a man and a}} woman who are not married), Ziherl argued that Martin could not sue him because <b>joint</b> <b>tortfeasors</b> - those involved in committing a crime - cannot sue each other over acts occurring as a result of a criminal act (Zysk v. Zysk, 404 S.E.2d 721 (Va. 1990)). Martin argued in rebuttal that because of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Lawrence v. Texas (finding that state's sodomy law unconstitutional), Virginia's anti-fornication law was also unconstitutional for the reasons cited in Lawrence. Martin argued, therefore, she could, in fact, sue Ziherl for damages.|$|R
40|$|Location: Library balcony Artist 2 ̆ 7 s Commentary January 28, 2004 Significance: This work {{is unique}} in that it {{reflects}} and draws upon relevant case law, theories, ideas, and history examined in the 1 st semester of law school here at the University of Georgia. Considering that our legal education here is premised on case study and in acknowledging and honoring the significance of Justice Holmes 2 ̆ 7 Lowell lectures I felt it only appropriate to title this work The Common Law. The following dialogue explains this work the the artist 2 ̆ 7 s perspective and gives some light to the various elements incorporated into this piece. Criminal Law: The faint beer bottle in the central character 2 ̆ 7 s head draws upon Proctor v. State symbolizing the concept of thought crimes. the two women with joined hands holding a purple tulip (see Torts) to the central character 2 ̆ 7 s neck draw upon concepts of conspiracy, murder, and attempt. Property: The feather in the hair of the woman (left) represents Johnson v. M 2 ̆ 7 Intosh and the concepts of right to title and right to occupancy. In the central character 2 ̆ 7 s left hand he bear a fox and a time piece on his wrist. Those elements are reflective of Pierson v. Post, the rule of capture, {{and the concept of}} first in time. In the central character 2 ̆ 7 s other hand he holds a twig, which draws upon the ceremonial practices of feudal England in the passing of seisin from one party to another. Civil Procedure: The man in the background in the legendary Rex Grossman, who is serving process in the most effective method, in person. The elongated arms of the woman being served are symbolic of the long-arm statutes provided in state laws. Contracts: The woman (left) is presenting a salt shaker in her right hand, symbolizing Droughty v. Salt and the concept of the donative gift promise. The lines running between the two characters in the background are symbolic of the formation of a contract in the meeting of the minds. Torts: The purple tulip is pulled from the Old English case of Byrd v. Holbrook and symbolizes the spring gun used to protect the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s garden. Here it is being used against the central character and raises the concern of doing with an instrument of device that which one is not permitted to do in person. The holding of hands also represents Summers v. Tice and the concept of <b>joint</b> <b>tortfeasors.</b> The life preserver bearing the name Grayton symbolizes the Grimstad case and the irony embodied in the court 2 ̆ 7 s but-for test. The four (4) dots on the eye of the woman (right) represent foresight, and the eye in her bun of hair represents hindsight. This relates to Eckert v. Long Island R. R. and Terry 2 ̆ 7 s flawed theory on negligence in using hindsight to determine foresight. The cracker in the jaw of the woman (left) draws upon the legend at common law that the kind had the Chancellor of the Writs pass out crackers to those complaining about the insufficient writs of trespass in order to quiet the crowd, thus the Ritz cracker. General Elements: The X 2 ̆ 7 s on the central character are reflective of the battle wounds first in the stomach, then the chest, and then in the neck sustained by Justice Holmes in his service to our country. The large hand of the central character bears on each finger 2 ̆ 2 learn 2 ̆ 2, which is a tribute to Justice Learned Hand. The tress in the background are the same trees visible through the large pane glass of the Law Library, constant companions of those who spend long days devoted to their studies. [URL]...|$|R
