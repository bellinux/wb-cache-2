5|$|Greed is {{the first}} main theme that is {{introduced}} into the book, and specifically the desire to obtain gold. In a similar manner to other themes in the book, it changes throughout, becoming less of a focus near to the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> where Artemis is willing to part with a large sum of money to help someone else.|$|E
5|$|Tariq, {{an ethnic}} Pashtun born in 1976, {{is a boy}} {{who grew up in}} Kabul with Laila. He lost a leg to a land mine at the age of five. They {{eventually}} evolve from best friends to lovers; after a decade of separation they are married and expecting a child by the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b>|$|E
5|$|These three {{objects are}} also {{mentioned}} in the story itself (see below), and are said {{to belong to the}} Peverell brothers, who are later revealed as being both Voldemort's and Harry Potter's ancestors. Towards the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> Albus Dumbledore also confirms Harry's connection to the Peverells, and states that the three brothers might in fact have been the creators of the Hallows.|$|E

5|$|A light novel titled Shikamaru Hiden: A Cloud Drifting in Silent Darkness, {{written by}} Takashi Yano and {{illustrated}} by Kishimoto, stars Shikamaru as the main character and narrator. The novel is set {{two years after the}} Fourth Ninja War, focusing on Shikamaru's assignment as organizer of the newly formed Shinobi Union to capture a rogue ninja who rules over the distant Land of Silence and attempts to establish a new world order ruled by the common people. It also explores his growing relationship with Temari, culminating in him struggling to name his child with her, years after the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to {{continuation}} Bond author Raymond Benson, {{there was}} {{further development of}} the Bond character in Thunderball, with glimpses of both his sense of humour and his own sense of mortality being shown. Felix Leiter had his largest role to date in a Bond story and much of his humour came though, whilst his incapacity, suffered in Live and Let Die, had not led to bitterness or to his being unable to join in with the underwater fight scene towards the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nan's {{experiences}} eventually reveal serious faults of {{the society}} she moves through, the primary element of a picaresque novel. For this and other reasons, Waters' books are frequently compared to stories by Charles Dickens; the reader follows Nan's movement from sheltered naif to exuberant theatre performer to rent-boy to mistress to housewife then socialist orator, showing allegiance to none of these professions or ideals. Michael Upchurch in The Seattle Times writes that Nan's inability or unwillingness to adhere to any profession or setting, remaining malleable until the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> indicates she is her own worst enemy. Likewise, Marianne Brace in The Independent considers Nan selfish and unsympathetic.|$|E
50|$|In a January 1916 {{review for}} Bookman, critic P.G. Hulbert, Jr. argued that <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> was absurd.|$|R
50|$|The anime series Boogiepop Phantom uses many {{characters}} from Boogiepop and Others, and makes repeated references to <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{epilogue}} {{tells of}} how Raskolnikov is sentenced {{to eight years}} of penal servitude in Siberia, where Sonya follows him. Dunya and Razumikhin marry and are left in a happy position by the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> while Pulkheria, Raskolnikov's mother, falls ill and dies, unable to cope with her son's situation. Raskolnikov himself struggles in Siberia. It is only after some time in prison that his redemption and moral regeneration begin under Sonya's loving influence.|$|E
5|$|The film {{is based}} on the 1986 novel by Winston Groom. Both center on the {{character}} of Forrest Gump. However, the film primarily focuses on the first eleven chapters of the novel, before skipping ahead to the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> with the founding of Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. and the meeting with Forrest, Jr. In addition to skipping some parts of the novel, the film adds several aspects to Gump's life that do not occur in the novel, such as his needing leg braces as a child and his run across the United States.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Hauser – Thomas is Max's {{closest friend}} {{and the only}} person who appears in one {{capacity}} or another wherever he is posted. A highly educated, multilingual SS officer like Max, he is Aue's main source of information about bureaucratic Nazi politics. He helps Max in a number of ways, both in advancing his career as well as rescuing him from his sister's house in Pomerania. He saves Max's life at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b>|$|E
50|$|The movie kept <b>the</b> tragic <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> with Rufus Dawes and Sylvia {{perishing}} {{in a storm}} after Reverend North {{had helped}} Dawes escape.|$|R
50|$|The Narrator: {{the narrator}} {{presents}} himself at <b>the</b> outset <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book as {{witness to the}} events and privy to documents, but does not identify himself with any character until <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b>|$|R
50|$|The show's last {{episode was}} a cliffhanger {{concerning}} Christy's fate {{in the town}} and with the two rival male love interests. Later TV movies resolved the love triangle according to <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b>|$|R
5|$|Toward the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> Renée {{comes out}} of her {{internal}} seclusion, teaching young Paloma that not all adults pursue vanity {{at the expense of}} their intelligence and humanity. However, only shortly after Renée realizes that the beauty of life and her connections with the world makes life worth living, she dies {{in the same way as}} Roland Barthes; she is struck down by a laundry van. This leaves Paloma and Ozu devastated but leads Paloma not to commit suicide.|$|E
5|$|Corentin and Madame du Gua, foils to {{the happy}} couple, plot and scheme {{endlessly}} {{to bring about}} the misery and downfall of those who will not love them. Du Gua is at first a sympathetic character, but by the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> she is presented as sharing a face with a spirit from hell. She represents revenge and hatred chiseled from romantic injury, and has been noted as a rough sketch of the title character in Balzac's La Cousine Bette. Corentin, meanwhile, stands in contrast to Montauran's romantic nature as much as to Hulot's military prowess. Rebuffed by Marie and unable to wield the might of the commandant, Corentin relies on trickery and deception to achieve his ruthless ends.|$|E
5|$|For {{three of}} the novels, Goldfinger, Live and Let Die and Dr. No, it is Bond the British agent who has to sort out what {{turns out to be}} an American problem, and Black points out that {{although}} it is American assets that are under threat in Dr. No, a British agent and a British warship, HMS Narvik, are sent with British soldiers to the island at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> to settle the matter. Fleming became increasingly jaundiced about America, and his comments in the penultimate novel You Only Live Twice reflect this; Bond's responses to Tanaka's comments reflect the declining relationship between Britain and America—in sharp contrast to the warm, co-operative relationship between Bond and Leiter in the earlier books.|$|E
50|$|Charlie Parker - Charlie was {{friends with}} Samantha {{throughout}} elementary school. They broke up when Samantha blamed him for stealing her bra, a crime he didn't commit. In <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> Samantha apologizes {{and they make}} up again.|$|R
5000|$|A {{powerful}} and aggressive knight of Housman that initially {{looks down on}} Cecily. However, after witnessing her fight against a monster, he starts to respect her more as a knight. He wields a zweihander (a two-handed sword). At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novels,</b> he marries Patty.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> sets up <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> Lincoln {{that opens}} <b>the</b> {{following}} <b>novel,</b> Dead Man's Ransom, {{in which an}} army under Stephen marches north to confront the rebellious barons, only to have them surrender and then be confronted by an army from the Empress Maud.|$|R
5|$|Ford reappears in the {{official}} novel continuation Stargate Atlantis Legacy: The Third Path. To their surprise, the team finds Ford alive and {{with a group of}} nomadic humans known as the Travelers. He explains to Sheppard he managed to escape the hive ship before it was destroyed, but crashed on the planet over which the battle took place. With the help of the Travelers, he recovered from his addiction but it took so long that he could no longer find Atlantis afterwards. Ford began leading a guerilla campaign against the Wraith, aided by the Travelers. He also now has a wife and son and regrets his previous actions under the Wraith enzyme. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> Ford is safely returned to Earth with his wife and son and reunites with his cousin and grandparents.|$|E
5|$|In Apur Panchali (the Bengali {{translation}} of , 1994), Ray {{wrote that he}} had omitted many of the novel's characters {{and that he had}} rearranged some of its sequences to make the narrative better as cinema. Changes include Indir's death, which occurs early in the novel at a village shrine in the presence of adults, while in the film Apu and Durga find her corpse in the open. The scene of Apu and Durga running {{to catch a glimpse of}} the train is not in the novel, in which neither child sees the train, although they try. Durga's fatal fever is attributed to a monsoon downpour in the film, but is unexplained in the novel. The ending of the film—the family's departure from the village—is not the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b>|$|E
5|$|Maier {{writes that}} the novel {{includes}} themes of love, with Hidjo's love for Woengoe, Betje, and Biroe paralleling that of Walter's love for Roos, Woengoe, and Betje. He also notes {{that there is a}} theme of social mobility, where Hidjo's relationships with noble women are fostered by his merchant father to grant the family a greater social position; bride prices also feature prominently, showing that one can become a noble through marriage if one has enough money. He notes that, towards the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> love is described as something only those with a Dutch education would attempt to find, as the social-financial meaning of marriage remains predominant among the traditional Javanese. The characters, despite not all marrying for love, are happy with their eventual partners and have a comfortable life.|$|E
50|$|Though {{the film}} follows {{the same basic}} {{structure}} as <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> its plot is more limited. The film does not depict <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> in which Jakob travels to a nearby city and meets his brother. The film remains almost exclusively focused on the institute once Jakob arrives there.|$|R
5000|$|At {{some point}} after <b>the</b> {{publication}} <b>of</b> {{one or more}} sequels (beginning with Great Sky River, for the American paperback edition), Benford appended a new ending onto <b>the</b> original <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b> <b>The</b> following section is from <b>the</b> second edition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book to bridge over to <b>the</b> continuance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Galactic Core Saga: ...|$|R
50|$|The Blinding Knife begins {{four days}} after <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{previous}} <b>novel.</b>|$|R
