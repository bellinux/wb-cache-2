5|$|Colbert {{received}} a chilly reception from the audience. His jokes were often met with silence and muttering, although {{some in the}} audience, such as Scalia, laughed heartily as Colbert teased them. This was <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to the warm reception accorded to a skit featuring Bush and his look-alike, Steve Bridges, which immediately preceded Colbert's monologue.|$|E
5|$|The Governor-General of the Congo, Pierre Ryckmans, {{decided on}} the day of Belgium's {{surrender}} that the colony would remain loyal to the Allies, <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to the French colonies that later pledged allegiance to the pro-German Vichy government. The Congo was therefore administered from London by the Belgian government in exile during the war.|$|E
5000|$|History {{records the}} horrendous {{aftermath}} of the lovers' catastrophe, events <b>in</b> <b>starkest</b> <b>contrast</b> to the conciliatory tone expressed by Shakespeare's Lords Montague and Capulet on the last page of that play.

50|$|<b>In</b> a <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to the band's debut Love, And Other Catastrophes, This Sporting Life was {{recorded}} without a budget {{at their home}} studio in Sheffield. The album was again produced by MiNI dOG, and this time only featured Abbott and Gledhill as performers.|$|R
5|$|This is <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to {{the stance}} taken by his predecessor, Clinton, whose {{approach}} {{and response to}} India after the 1998 nuclear tests was that of sanctions and hectoring. The relationship between India and the United States was one that dramatically improved during Bush's tenure.|$|E
5|$|At {{the lowest}} level of the façade is a plain base, {{contrasting}} with and stabilising the ornate arcades that rise above it. The base is penetrated by three doors, which are <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to the often imposing portals of French Gothic cathedrals. The outer two are of domestic proportion and the central door is ornamented only by a central post, quatrefoil and the fine mouldings of the arch.|$|E
5|$|However, the bathhouse of {{the spirits}} cannot {{be seen as a}} place free of {{ambiguity}} and darkness. Many of the employees are rude to Chihiro because she is human, and corruption is ever-present; it is a place of excess and greed, as depicted in the initial appearance of the No-Face. <b>In</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to the simplicity of Chihiro's journey and transformation is the constant chaotic carnival in the background.|$|E
2500|$|<b>In</b> a <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to his Test career, Dravid had to {{struggle}} a lot to make a mark in the ODIs. Between his ODI debut in April 1996 {{and the end of}} 1998 calendar year, Dravid regularly found himself {{in and out of the}} ODI team.|$|R
5000|$|<b>In</b> a <b>stark</b> <b>contrast,</b> Lieutenant-General Vladimir Shamanov, who was Budanov's {{commanding}} officer, exhibited strong sympathy towards him. He {{said that}} Budanov {{was one of}} his best commanders and offered this challenge: [...] "To Budanov's enemies I say: Don't put your paws on the image of a Russian soldier and officer." ...|$|R
25|$|Between 1974 and 1999, Another World won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series {{only once}} (<b>in</b> 1976), a <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to five wins for The Young and the Restless and six for General Hospital within that time frame.|$|R
5|$|Some {{scenes in}} the film portray demon-like and other fictional creatures {{as part of the}} Persian army, and the fictionalized {{portrayal}} of Persian King Xerxes I has been criticized as effeminate. Critics suggested that this was meant to stand <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to the sheer masculinity of the Spartan army. Steven Rea argued that the film's Persians were a vehicle for an anachronistic cross-section of Western stereotypes of Asian and African cultures.|$|E
5|$|The Empire's {{successful}} navigation {{of these}} crises considerably enhanced the nation's stability and prestige, and Brazil {{emerged as a}} hemispheric power. Internationally, Europeans began to regard the country as embodying familiar liberal ideals, such as {{freedom of the press}} and constitutional respect for civil liberties. Its representative parliamentary monarchy also stood <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to the mix of dictatorships and instability endemic in the other nations of South America during this period.|$|E
5|$|The loud goose-like honking call is a {{familiar}} sound, particularly during the breeding season; pairs often honk in unison, and often carry {{on for some time}} when perched. The male's call is higher-pitched and more rapid than that of the female. Australian naturalist David Fleay observed that the call is among the loudest and furthest-carrying of all Australian bird calls, <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to the relatively quiet calls of the wedge-tailed eagle.|$|E
50|$|The {{fill light}} also shines on the subject, {{but from a}} side angle {{relative}} to the key and is often placed at a lower position than the key (about {{at the level of}} the subject's face). It balances the key by illuminating shaded surfaces, and lessening or eliminating chiaroscuro effects, such as the shadow cast by a person's nose upon the rest of the face. It is usually softer and less bright than the key light (up to half), and more to a flood. Not using a fill at all can result <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrasts</b> (due to shadows) across the subject's surface, depending upon the key light's harshness. Sometimes, as in low-key lighting, this is a deliberate effect, but shots intended to look more natural and less stylistic require a fill.|$|R
50|$|Illinois Route 35 is a 2.42 mi {{connector}} {{road between}} U.S. Route 20 in East Dubuque and Highway 35 at the Wisconsin state line.

5|$|The other 10% {{of cases}} are {{primarily}} caused by primary hyperplasia, or {{an increase of}} the number of cells. Parathyroid carcinoma accounts for less than 1% of all cases, occurring most frequently in individuals around 50 years of age (<b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to OFC as a result of primary hyperparathyroidism) and showing no gender preference. Approximately 95% of hyperparatyhroidism caused by genetic factors is attributed to MEN type 1. This mutation also tends to affect younger individuals.|$|E
5|$|Between 1934 and 1963, {{the four}} wardens of Alcatraz resided here, {{including}} the first warden, James A. Johnston. A house of luxury, <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to the jail next to it, the wardens often held lavish cocktail parties here. The signpost at the spot shows {{a photograph of a}} trusted inmate doing chores at the house for the warden and that the house had a terraced garden and greenhouse. The mansion had tall windows, providing fine views of San Francisco Bay. Today, the house is a ruin, burned down by Native Americans during the Occupation of Alcatraz on June 1, 1970.|$|E
5|$|In Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, the group's {{style was}} moving towards art rock, being {{influenced}} by the bands Blur, Arcade Fire and My Bloody Valentine. The band experimented with different instruments including orchestras, honky-tonk pianos and further so. Mylo Xyloto carries the concept album format from the love and war-induced Viva la Vida. It also expands the spectrum by including electronic & acoustic elements, featuring upbeat tones {{for the first time}} and predominantly being a pop rock album, <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to the band's previous works. Lyrical influences were taken from graffiti and the German resistance group White Rose.|$|E
5000|$|As Allmusic {{describes}} it, {{the song}} [...] "featured an arrangement dominated by piano and a vocal chorus adding distinctive 'ba-doo's throughout is ...slicker than, say, [...] "Cry! Cry! Cry!" [...] or [...] "I Walk the Line" [...] with an eccentric tone {{all its own}} [...] - [...] largely because the vocal chorus (who sound as if they're occupying a middle ground between doo wop and barbershop quartet) is <b>in</b> such <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to Cash's lead vocal." ...|$|R
50|$|The 1934 United States Senate {{election}} in Montana {{took place on}} November 6, 1934. Incumbent United States Senator Burton K. Wheeler, who was first elected to the Senate in 1922, and was re-elected in 1928, ran for re-election. After easily winning the Democratic primary, Wheeler {{moved on to the}} general election, where he faced George M.

2500|$|Rodney Stark {{argues that}} [...] "the {{fundamental}} problem facing Muslim theologians vis-à-vis {{the morality of}} slavery is that Muhammad bought, sold, captured, and owned slaves", though he states that Muhammad did advise that slaves be treated well: [...] "Feed them what you eat yourself and clothe them with what you wear...They are God's people like unto you and be kind unto them". <b>In</b> addition, <b>Stark</b> <b>contrasts</b> Islam with Christianity, implying that Christian theologians wouldn't {{have been able to}} [...] "work their way around the biblical acceptance of slavery" [...] if Jesus had owned slaves like Muhammad did.|$|R
5|$|In {{the course}} of four hours, a series of blunders in {{planning}} and communication had caused Lee's forces to launch three failed frontal infantry assaults across hundreds of yards of open ground, unsupported by Confederate artillery, charging toward firmly entrenched Union infantry and artillery defenses. These errors provided Union forces {{with an opportunity to}} inflict heavy casualties. In the aftermath of the battle, however, the Confederate press heralded Lee as the savior of Richmond. <b>In</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast,</b> McClellan was accused of being absent from the battlefield, a harsh criticism that haunted him when he ran for president in 1864.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the more}} populous of the two dozen or so villages which now {{comprise}} the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, Low Fell has a long and rich history. <b>In</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to the industrial development of its near neighbour Sheriff Hill, the settlement at Low Fell developed through {{the building of a}} new road to bypass the steep turnpike road which ran through Sheriff Hill, which in turn encouraged both private enterprise (particularly public houses) and the incumbency of dozens of wealthy individuals who built substantial villas in which they could escape the dirt and grime of 19thcentury Newcastle upon Tyne.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{characteristic}} traits of Kim's mature style, first seen {{in these three}} films, are gothic excess, surrealism, horror, perversions and sexuality. Although <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to the realism, harmony, balance and sentimentality typical of Korean cinema of the time, Kim's films, in an eccentric and metaphorical way, deal {{with the realities of}} postwar, industrializing South Korean society and psychology. After having firmly established his auteur status with these films, Kim's unique vision began to wane in his films of the later 1960s.|$|E

5|$|The Welsh {{performance}} during the 1893 Home Nations Championship was <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> {{to the previous}} year. Under the captaincy of Gould, Wales not only won the Championship for the first time, but also the Triple Crown. The first match of the campaign was against England, and played at the Cardiff Arms Park. The pitch had been kept from freezing over the night before by 500 braziers dispersed across the playing field. This led to a slippery ground, with play further hampered by a strong wind.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Espanyol {{was seen}} by the vast {{majority}} of Barcelona's citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority, <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to Barça's revolutionary spirit. Also in the 1960s and 1970s, while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia's new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a better life, Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen, military officers, civil servants and career fascists.|$|E
5|$|Using the {{opportunity}} to rebuild their strength, the German Army in the West was able to accumulate a strength of around 500 tanks and assault guns by late September, despite prioritization of new equipment for the Eastern Front. This was <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> to the estimated 100 which had been available before. German defenses along the Siegfried Line continued to strengthen, and the Wehrmacht was able to establish a defensive depth of an average of , with the strongest defenses built opposite of Patton's Third Army.|$|E
5000|$|Epic in its scale, Red Strangers spans {{four generations}} of a Kikuyu family in Africa and their {{relationship}} with European settlers, who were nicknamed [...] "red" [...] strangers due to their sunburns.The book, by describing a Kenyan tribe and their way of life, with its rituals, its beliefs, its codes and its morality, shows European customs <b>in</b> <b>stark,</b> unflattering <b>contrast</b> with Kikuyu traditions. The differences in cultural attitudes to war, methods of cultivation, the administering of justice, {{and the use of}} money are played out in this semi-fictional view of the damaging forces of colonization.|$|R
40|$|Urban {{poverty is}} an {{emerging}} problem. This book explores {{the household and}} neighbourhood factors that lead to both the generation and continuance of urban poverty in China. It is argued that the urban Chinese are not a homogenous social group, but combine laid-off workers and rural migrants, resulting <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrasts</b> between migrant and workers' neighbourhoods and villages. The expert authors examine the new urban poor in China and the dynamics of their poor neighbourhoods highlighting both household experience and neighbourhood changes affecting the urban poor. "Urban Poverty in China" is based upon a comprehensive household survey in six Chinese cities and provides insights into microscopic and neighbourhood level poverty dynamics. The comprehensive study explores the spatial implications such as concentration of poverty {{as well as the}} differentiation within poor neighbourhoods. This informative book tells an insightful story about evolving urban poverty in Chinese cities that will be invaluable to researchers and postgraduate students within urban studies, geography, social policy, development studies, as well as Chinese and Asian studies. It will also prove to be an invaluable read for researchers in urban and social development and international development agencies...|$|R
40|$|Employing the Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS) {{published}} by the University of Michigan as the measure of investor sentiment, we investigate its impact on individual stock returns and industry portfolio returns. Consistent with previous studies, {{we find that the}} impact of investor sentiment is more concentrated on small stocks than large stocks. More interestingly, investor sentiment seems to be able to predict the momentum payoffs observed in individual stock returns, which remains true even after investor sentiment is adjusted by a set of macroeconomic variables. <b>In</b> a <b>stark</b> <b>contrast,</b> investor sentiment does not show any evidence of affecting industry portfolio returns and neither does it capture the industry momentum...|$|R
