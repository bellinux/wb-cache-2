Topical application of various V.thapsus-based preparations was recommended {{for the treatment}} of warts, boils, carbuncles, <b>hemorrhoids,</b> and chilblains, amongst others. Recent studies have found that great mullein contains glycyrrhizin compounds with bactericide and potential anti-tumoral action. These compounds are concentrated in the flowers. The German Commission E sanctioned medicinal use of the plant for catarrhs. It was also part of the National Formulary in the United States and United Kingdom. The plant's leaves, in addition to the seeds, have been reported to contain rotenone, although quantities are unknown.|$|E

Due to the press of Congressional business, Voorhis was able to devote only two months to the campaign, while Nixon campaigned in the district for ten months. Voorhis's time was further limited when, while en route to California from Washington D.C. in August, he was forced to have surgery for <b>hemorrhoids</b> in Ogden, Utah.

Surgical treatment is {{of the most common}} treatment methods of <b>hemorrhoid.</b> In addition to the usual treatments, classic therapies and complementary medicine are also applied. Medicinal herbs have been traditionally a source for the treatment of many diseases. Many native medicinal plants of Iran have had effective properties on <b>hemorrhoid.</b> Thus, in this review,the effective medicinal plants of Iranian ethnobotanical resources on <b>hemorrhoid</b> were reported. In this review study, a search for articles by the keywords hemorrhoid,ethnobotanical, and medicinal plants was done. A search on the databases, such as Scopus, ISI C, S ID, MegIran,and a number of other databases was performed. Based on the results obtained, 11 herbs from different parts of Iran are traditionally used to treat anorexia.

25|$|Pathological {{anastomosis}} {{results from}} trauma or disease and may involve veins, arteries, or intestines. These are usually {{referred to as}} fistulas. In the cases of veins or arteries, traumatic fistulas usually occur between artery and vein. Traumatic intestinal fistulas usually occur between two loops of intestine (entero-enteric fistula) or intestine and skin (enterocutaneous fistula). Portacaval anastomosis, by contrast, is an anastomosis between a vein of the portal circulation and a vein of the systemic circulation, which allows blood to bypass the liver in patients with portal hypertension, often resulting in <b>hemorrhoids,</b> esophageal varices, or caput medusae.|$|E
25|$|In the Secret History of the Mongols, the Mongol peoples {{are said}} to have descended from the mating of a doe (gua maral) and a wolf (boerte chino). In modern Mongolia, the wolf is still seen as a good luck symbol, {{especially}} for males. In Mongolian folk medicine, eating the intestines of a wolf is said to alleviate chronic indigestion, while sprinkling food with powdered wolf rectum is said to cure <b>hemorrhoids.</b> Mongol mythology explains the wolf's occasional habit of surplus killing by pointing to their traditional creation story. It states that when God explained to the wolf what it should and should not eat, he told it that it may eat one sheep out of 1,000. The wolf however misunderstood and thought God said kill 1,000 sheep and eat one.|$|E
25|$|Gastrointestinal {{disorders}} {{include such}} conditions as constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, <b>hemorrhoids,</b> anal fissures, perianal abscesses, anal fistulas, perianal infections, diverticular diseases, colitis, colon polyps and cancer.

In a study investigating the association between drinking water quality and gastrointestinal illness in the elderly of Philadelphia, scientists found water quality 9 to 11 days before the visit was negatively associated with hospital admissions for gastrointestinal illness, with an interquartile range increase in turbidity being associated with a 9% increase). The association was stronger in those over 75 than in the population aged 65–74. This example is a small reflection of residents of the United States remain at risk of waterborne gastrointestinal illness under current water treatment practices.|$|E

Lecca was fined a further 4,000 lei, and 2 years were nominally added to his prison sentence. Lecca was by then being held in the Jilava prison, detained together with lawyer-politician Aurelian Bentoiu and literary critic Nicolae Steinhardt.

25|$|Anal sex can {{exacerbate}} <b>hemorrhoids</b> {{and therefore}} result in bleeding; in other cases, {{the formation of}} a hemorrhoid is attributed to anal sex. If bleeding occurs as a result of anal sex, it may also be because of a tear in the anal or rectal tissues (an anal fissure) or perforation (a hole) in the colon, the latter of which being a serious medical issue that should be remedied by immediate medical attention. Because of the rectum's lack of elasticity, the anal mucous membrane being thin, and small blood vessels being present directly beneath the mucous membrane, tiny tears and bleeding in the rectum usually result from penetrative anal sex, though the bleeding is usually minor and therefore usually not visible. By contrast to other anal sexual behaviors, anal fisting poses a more serious danger of damage due to the deliberate stretching of the anal and rectal tissues; anal fisting injuries include anal sphincter lacerations and rectal and sigmoid colon (rectosigmoid) perforation, which might result in death.|$|E
