40|$|The {{number of}} {{published}} cases of adenomatoid odontogenic tumor (AOT) has steadily increased, {{and about half}} were reported in Asian populations. Although the clinicopathologic profile of AOT has been extensively reported, factual knowledge of its pathogenesis is rudimentary at best, and there is controversy as to precisely which odontogenic epithelium it arises from. AOT is a successional tooth-associated lesion which develops during the mixed dentition. The permanent successor differs from its deciduous predecessor in that it has an eruptive pathway from the dental follicle to the gingiva, the <b>gubernaculum</b> <b>dentis.</b> With this background in mind, the present review focuses mainly on the early development of AOT. We successfully demonstrated a close spatial relationship between AOT and the <b>gubernaculum</b> <b>dentis</b> in a typical case. From further observations of the same AOT in which an enclosed permanent canine showed enamel hypoplasia, {{it is possible to}} pinpoint areas around the crown of a developing successional tooth in continuity with the <b>gubernaculum</b> <b>dentis</b> as starting points. In addition, we discuss the unifying histogenetic concept of three clinical variants, namely, pericoronal (follicular), extracoronal (extrafollicular), (see Article note) and peripheral...|$|E
40|$|The dental {{basement}} membrane (BM) putatively mediates epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during tooth morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation. Type IV collagen a chains, a major network-forming protein of the dental BM, was studied and results disclosed distinct expression patterns {{at different stages}} of mouse molar germ development. At the dental placode and bud stage, the BM of the oral epithelium expressed alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 5 and alpha 6 chains while the <b>gubernaculum</b> <b>dentis,</b> in addition to the above four chains, also expressed alpha 4 chain. An asymmetrical expression for alpha 4, alpha 5 and alpha 6 chains was observed at the bud stage. At the early bell stage, the BM associated with the inner enamel epithelium (IEE) of molar germ expressed alpha 1, alpha 2 and alpha 4 chains while the BM of the outer enamel epithelium (OEE) expressed only alpha 1 and alpha 2 chains. With the onset of dentinogenesis, the collagen alpha chain profile of the IEE BM gradually disappeared. However from the early to late bell stage, the <b>gubernaculum</b> <b>dentis</b> consistently expressed alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 5 and alpha 6 chains resembling fetal oral mucosa. These findings suggest that stage- and position-specific distribution of type IV collagen alpha subunits occur during molar germ development and that these changes are essential for molar morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation.
