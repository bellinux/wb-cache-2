5|$|On Saturday 1 July 1871, {{an opening}} banquet was {{attended}} by the Prime Minister William Gladstone, {{who was also a}} shareholder. The following Monday, Mansion House opened and the District began running its own trains. From this date, the two companies operated a joint inner circle service between Mansion House and Moorgate Street via South Kensington and Edgware Road that ran <b>every</b> <b>ten</b> minutes. This was supplemented by a District service <b>every</b> <b>ten</b> minutes between Mansion House and West Brompton, and Hammersmith & City Railway and Great Western Railway (GWR) suburban services between Edgware Road and Moorgate Street. The permissions for the railway east of Mansion House were allowed to lapse. At {{the other end of the}} line, the District part of South Kensington station opened on 10 July 1871 and Earl's Court station opened on the West Brompton extension on 30 October 1871.|$|E
5|$|The General Assembly delegates {{are elected}} from districts. <b>Every</b> <b>ten</b> years the districts are realigned by the General Assembly using {{information}} from the U.S. Census Bureau to ensure that each district is roughly equal in population.

5|$|An {{applicant}} applies for a gun license at {{a designated}} local {{office of the}} National police. If the conditions of age, qualification, health clearance, criminal integrity and personal reliability are met and a fee of 700 CZK per category is paid, the license shall be issued in 30 days. The license must be renewed <b>every</b> <b>ten</b> years (no need to undergo qualification exam if the application is filed at least 2 months before termination of the previous license; health clearance still necessary).|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge's {{personal}} turmoil did not hinder {{his political}} accomplishments. He was appointed superintendent {{of public education}} by Governor William Owsley. He was the sixth person to hold the office since its creation in the 1830s. The task was daunting. Only one of <b>every</b> <b>ten</b> school-age children in Kentucky ever attended school, and at least thirty Kentucky counties had received no state educational funds since 1840.|$|E
5|$|Cork is {{produced}} from the thick bark of the cork oak (Quercus suber). It is harvested {{from the living}} trees about once <b>every</b> <b>ten</b> years in an environmentally sustainable industry. More than half the world's cork comes from Portugal and is largely used to make stoppers for wine bottles. Other uses include floor tiles, bulletin boards, balls, footwear, cigarette tips, packaging, insulation and joints in woodwind instruments.|$|E

Vincent dies while in one of the vaults, causing Dinah to become depressed. Later, the hooded angel, which normally guards the entrance to the mausoleum, appears as two stones that talk to Dinah and help her overcome the depression which resulted from Vincent's death.|$|E
5|$|Members of the House of Representatives {{are elected}} {{every two years}} by popular vote within a congressional {{district}}. From 1895 till 1913, Utah had an at-large congressional district that represented the entire state. <b>Every</b> <b>ten</b> years, the number of congressional districts is reapportioned based on the state's population {{as determined by the}} United States Census; Utah has had four districts since 2013.|$|E
5|$|A {{special session}} of the {{legislature}} in 1965 changed the Senate to represent 16 districts and reapportioned the seats, again by county, but did so {{in such a way}} as to make the representation more proportional to population than it had been. Thus, the eastern shore, which had previously elected nine Senators, elected only four after 1965. This was done to preserve the ideal of having whole counties represented by a single Senator, rather than breaking counties up into multiple districts. A constitutional amendment in 1972 expanded the Senate to 47 members, elected from districts proportional to the population. These districts are reapportioned <b>every</b> <b>ten</b> years based on the United States Census to ensure they remain proportional.|$|E

In 2015, it was announced the State Department would no longer permit staff to be housed at the Waldorf-Astoria, due to security concerns arising from the recent purchase of the property by Chinese business interests. Whether the decision would impact {{the status of the}} residence was not made clear, however, as of March 2016 the hotel was still being occupied by the U.S. ambassador.|$|E
5|$|Before loading, {{the cannon}} would be cleaned {{with a wet}} sponge to {{extinguish}} any smouldering material from the last shot. Fresh powder could be set off prematurely by lingering ignition sources. The powder was added, followed by wadding of paper or hay, and the ball was placed in and rammed down. After ramming, the cannon would be aimed with the elevation set using a quadrant and a plummet. At 45 degrees, the ball had the utmost range: about ten times the gun's level range. Any angle above a horizontal line was called random-shot. Wet sponges were used to cool the pieces <b>every</b> <b>ten</b> or twelve rounds.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge began reforms {{immediately}} and zealously. He secured the General Assembly's {{passage of a}} two-cent property tax for education. The tax was subject to voter approval, and Breckinridge worked hard to publicize the issue. His efforts paid off, as the tax passed by almost a two-to-one margin. Continuing to publicize needs and push legislators to action, Breckinridge enjoyed the support of {{five of the six}} governors under whom he served. Only John L. Helm, who opposed a state-funded school system, challenged him, but Helm's veto of a Breckinridge educational bill was overridden in the General Assembly. Breckinridge's reforms manifested tangible results. From 1847 to 1850, educational spending increased from $6,000 to $144,000. By 1850, only one out of <b>every</b> <b>ten</b> school age children did not attend school.|$|E

5|$|The 47 districts {{from which}} Senators are elected are apportioned <b>every</b> <b>ten</b> {{years on the}} basis of population. Maryland's {{constitution}} explicitly defines the process for the drawing of these districts, requiring that the Governor make a recommendation of a new electoral map and submit it for legislative approval. As of 2005, there were approximately 112,000 people in each district. Each Senate district also elects three Delegates, and incumbent Senators and Delegates will often run jointly as members of incumbent slates in their districts. It is rare, however, for an incumbent to be challenged.|$|E
5|$|The Pulaski {{station was}} {{proposed}} in 1980 and constructed from 1987 to 1993. When the station opened in 1993, it spurred commercial {{development in the}} surrounding area {{and led to a}} parking controversy on nearby residential streets. Pulaski consists of an elevated island platform above a station house which is set back from Pulaski Road. The station also includes a bus terminal and a park and ride lot. Nearly 1.4 million passengers boarded Orange Line trains at Pulaski in 2010. Trains serve Pulaski approximately <b>every</b> <b>ten</b> minutes during rush hour but are less frequent at other times. In addition to offering train service, Pulaski also connects to several CTA bus routes.|$|E
5|$|The Trøndelag Commuter Rail offers hourly {{services}} in each direction: northbound to Steinkjer and southbound to Trondheim and Lerkendal. During peak hours, the frequency is doubled. Travel time to Trondheim is 38 minutes and to Lerkendal 51 minutes. Northwards, travel time to Levanger is 48 minutes, to Verdal 1 hour and 2 minutes, and to Steinkjer 1 hour and 26 minutes. The commuter rail is operated with Class 92 trains. From the airport, there is connection with local buses operated by Nettbuss. Klæburuten operates an airport coach {{to and from}} the city center of Trondheim <b>every</b> <b>ten</b> minutes from 4 in the morning until 9 in the evening.

5|$|The {{foundation}} document stipulated that fees {{were to be}} fixed by the governors and could range from £4–8 per year; in 1888, the fees charged were £7/10s per year. Provision was made for the allocation of scholarships {{to the value of}} the tuition fees for one in <b>every</b> <b>ten</b> boys in the school; one-half of the scholarships were arranged by the governors and awarded only to boys who had spent three years education in a public elementary school. Around the turn of the 20thcentury, an attempt was made to attract younger boys into the school by reducing fees for those under the age of 12 from £2/20s to £2 per term.|$|E
5|$|A Microsoft Windows {{version of}} the game, ported by Demiurge Studios, was {{released}} on May 28, 2008. This version features optimized controls designed specifically for personal computers, high resolution graphics, a new user interface, and other minor changes. BioWare initially intended to use SecuROM, a digital rights management software which would require online activation after installation and additional authentication checks <b>every</b> <b>ten</b> days. However, the company ultimately decided not to use it after listening to criticism from fans. In 2012, {{five years after the}} release of the original Xbox 360 version, Mass Effect was ported to Sony's PlayStation 3 console by Edge of Reality, featuring some lighting and visual effects improvements. It was released digitally on the PlayStation Network and as part of the Mass Effect Trilogy compilation. In 2015, Mass Effect was added to the list of backward compatible Xbox 360 games on Xbox One.|$|E
5|$|As more {{information}} about 's notoriety among neighbors surfaced, focus of investigation shifted towards {{the circumstances under which}} he gained and retained gun license and firearms. In order to be granted a gun license in the Czech Republic, a person must pass a qualification exam, receive a health clearance by a general practitioner, who may require a further examination by a specialist, such as a psychological or psychiatric evaluation, and must pass a background check. According to Section 23 of the Czech Firearms Act, an applicant may not be granted a license if he has committed more than one misdemeanor against public order in the previous three years. Similarly, the law further makes gun license unaccessible to people with mental illnesses. The license must be renewed every five years (<b>every</b> <b>ten</b> years for licenses issued after 1 July 2014). The renewal requires the presentation of a new health clearance, while the police conduct a new background check. 's license was renewed in January 2015.|$|E
