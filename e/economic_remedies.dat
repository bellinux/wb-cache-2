It reviews some of the criminological and economic literature on unemployment, property crime, health inequality and worker well-being. It stresses the explanatory importance both of adopting a chronological approach to people’s experience of economic circumstances relative to others and of pursuing <b>economic</b> <b>remedies</b> on two levels: individually (investment in mental health treatment and protective strategies) and at a societal level (avoidance of strategies that will increase unemployment etc). Four conclusions are drawn: first, criminologists should strive to enhance links within and across disciplines; second, that injecting resources into protective strategies may be significantly more cost effective than merely punishing individual offenders; third, that the economic and personal consequences of these issues are sufficiently serious to make this task urgent; and finally, that current economic circumstances should make such proposals irresistible...|$|E

The rhetoric of self-help also typically includes empowering unrepresented individuals to help themselves. But how do self-help programs respond to litigants’ efforts at self-advocacy? This Article reports findings from a study of courthouse self-help programs assisting unrepresented litigants applying for protection orders. The central finding is that self-help staff members were not neutral {{in the provision of}} services despite a professed ethic of neutrality. Using the sociological concept of demeanor, this Article shows that staff members rewarded protection order applicants who conformed to stereotypes about domestic violence victims and responded negatively to litigants who raised questions or sought assistance outside the scope of narrowly defined services. Staff members also failed to provide assistance with important <b>economic</b> <b>remedies</b> and de-prioritized safety planning and referrals to vital antiviolence services. In these and other ways, staff members influenced what relief was sought and by whom.

This chapter discusses the failure of global educational governance as an <b>economic</b> <b>remedy</b> specifically {{in relation to the}} raising of the school leaving age in Australia. It argues that global policy-making for economic competitiveness not only "sidelines the social purposes of education" (Ball S, Curriculo sem Fronteiras 1 (2) : 27 - 43, 2001) and is designed to exercise control over the education process but also fails to recognise the particularity of the local. To make the case two threads are pursued. The first is a critique of the research on the returns for schooling per se. We argue that the research evidence promoted by organisations such as the OECD is dogged by methodological and data problems. The second thread draws attention to the need to identify heterogeneity in returns, particularly with reference to those young people who are currently disengaged and reluctant learners. It will draw attention to the work of Dockery (Assessing the value of additional years of schooling for the non academically inclined. LSAY research reports.

Regarding good governance, it is found that the corporate managers and stockholders possess opposing view. While managers of the studied firms find governance of their companies is quite well but stockholders view that it is very poor. This happened especially in terms of turnover, production, capital, leverage, debt service, credit policy, solvency, human resource, recruitment, technology, customer satisfaction, internal control, strength, opportunity, competition, industry position, collective bargaining agent (CBA) issues and <b>economic</b> <b>remedies</b> which the study found the groups differ in perception; whereas, they have similar view in terms of adequacy of research fund, company weaknesses and threats, contingency plans, presence of political influence. The managers think that the companies do not have enough retained earnings and these should not be distributed among stockholders, but the stockholders think otherwise. Managers always perceive that they are underpaid whereas stockholders express the opposite view. Each group believes that it is the other group that dominates the decision-making. While both the groups want to have mutual interaction but stockholders want to interact more than the mangers. No doubt this attitudinal differences are not good for smooth functioning of the corporations, what is needed is openness, more dialogues, mutual trust and understanding of each other.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this thesis was to explore how it is {{possible}} to establish feminist solidarity amongst women who sit on different intersections of identity categories. The research was inspired by the optimism that gaining a deeper insight into solidarity building might enrich development programmes and projects which currently largely rely on legal and <b>economic</b> <b>remedies</b> in the process of instigating a positive social change, such as gender equality. The theoretical framework used draws on the work of Nira Yuval-Davis on ‘Intersectionality and Belonging’. Intersectionality is a theory which seeks to examine the complex interweaving of material positioning and identity work of women (Crenshaw, 1991; Yuval- Davis, 2006 and 2011). On the other hand, belonging, for Yuval-Davis (2011; 2011 a) is a means through which scholars and practice groups may dig underneath the basic concept of intersections to understand why and how women may become affiliated with a particular cause and become emotionally attached to that cause. The Fiji Women’s Forum (FWF), which comprises over a hundred members from 26 different organisations, served as the case study for this research. The methodology used in this research is narrative discourse analysis of field interviews and the data was analysed via a three-stage discourse analysis framework designed by Krzyzanowski and Wodak (2008). Intersectionality was found to be a valuable theoretical lens with which to explore the intersectional identifications of FWF participants. Such an approach particularly highlighted the strength of identification women held with a cross-section of identifications other than gender. Nevertheless, such intersectional analysis in itself did not explain the capacity of the women in this study to generate solidarity. Rather, these intersectional identifications were redefined and reframed into what is referred to as ‘discourses of enabling’. These discourses of democracy, learning and safety are important because they are simultaneously rooted in the context of participants’ contextual, intersectional identifications and adapt these identifications into discourses which seem to enable solidarity building...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{presented}} to the 1998 conference of the Brazil Society for Political Economy. Two short sections are flagged for later incorporation, and this never happened so the article is until now unpublished. The ground these were to address is fully covered elsewhere, however this text contains material that does not exist anywhere else, so for the record I am depositing it with Repec. The original abstract follows: The paper examines the present state of the discipline of economics in the light of Marx's Critique of political economy. Marx's dedication to the study of economic theory is without parallel {{in the history of the}} subject; yet, in the work of the economists of today, he receives less attention than in any other subject. Moreover the profession's unanimous official teaching, repeated tirelessly and dogmatically for most of this century, is that Marx's development of the classical theory of value leads irrevocably into contradiction, that therefore the further development of this theory is fruitless and the only alternative is its current orthodoxy. This state of affairs is called into question by an internal crisis of economics, provoked by a combination of two factors: the appalling failure of its official remedies, and the political defeat of Keynesianism. Major international institutions such as UNCTAD, the World Bank and the IMF are in open conflict over their predictions and recommendations concerning globalisation; the profession itself faces a growing body of internal criticism, and heterodox economic associations are flourishing. The abandonment of Keynesian <b>economic</b> <b>remedies,</b> the consequent loss of influence by economics in policy-making circles, and the relegation of economics to the status of an ancillary of banking and commerce, has accelerated this crisis. The large body of economists displaced from positions of influence at the ears of governments have been reflecting more carefully than before on the transitory nature of market phenomena. This paper proposes a materialist analysis of the theory and practice of academic economics, the body of thought which Marx dubbed the 'graveyard of economics'. It proposes to subject the claim of the profession to be acting as a science to a rigorous theoretical enquiry, examining both its reaction to the empirical facts of its failures, and the manner in which its theoretical categories express the material interests to which it is subjected. The aim is not dismiss the profession and its products as simple apologetics, but to uncover the internal structure of its thought and to propose an alternative, critical standard of scientific conduct for economic enquiry under a market economy. ...|$|E

40|$|The remedy {{stage of}} USA vs. Microsoft Corporation has raised three main controversies: - Conduct vs. {{structural}} remedies. Certain parties (SIIA, 1999; Salop and Romaine, 1999; Lenard, 2000) asked for structural remedies, {{such as a}} break-up, whereas others (Gassée, 1999) called for restrictions on Microsoft behaviour by mandatory rules of conduct. Even among plaintiffs a disensus appeared. The states of Illinois and Ohio voiced doubt {{about the use of}} structural reliefs (Ryan and Montgomery, 2000). They proposed to test in a first step whether conduct remedies would alone be sufficient to restore competition. - Horizontal divestiture vs. full divestiture. The Department of Justice proposed that the U. S. District Court break up Microsoft horizontally by separating the operating systems business and applications business. During the remedy hearings, the District Judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, asked the Assistant Attorney General, Joël Klein, whether an additional separation of Internet browser business would not be also appropriate. He mentioned an amici curiae brief (CCIA and SIIA, 2000) as supporting this option. In another amici curiae brief (Litan et alii, 2000) submitted to Judge Jackson, a full divestiture including the break-up of the Windows monopoly in three identical parts was recommended. - Beneficial vs. harmful effects to consumers of the operating systems/applications separation. Following the recommendations of the Antitrust Division, the District Court of Columbia ordered the horizontal separation of Microsoft. According to the Antitrust Division, such a divestiture promises to have significant benefits for competition in general and innovation in particular (US DoJ, 2000). Some columnists (Financial Times, April 29 2000) remained more skeptical pointing out that a price increase is likely to result from the replacement of one monopoly by two vertical monopolies. The paper is aimed at casting light on these controversies in using economic analysis. It is divided into 4 sections, one for each controversy, and a conclusive section. Section 1 argues that the key economic distinction to introduce amongst antitrust remedies is between <b>economic</b> <b>remedies</b> based on incentives and command-and-control remedies rather than between behavioral and structural remedies. Section 2 compares different solutions to break-up Microsoft using the maximising of the consumers’ welfare as a yardstick. It points out that the horizontal divestiture dominates the other choices only under a restrictive set of ad hoc hypotheses (e. g., the expected costs of Windows’ fragmentation is higher than the benefits provided by vertical integration). Section 3 examines to what extent the chosen remedy, that is the horizontal divestiture, is not worse than the evil it is supposed to cure. It establishes that the horizontal divestiture is welfare decreasing for consumers in several plausible circumstances (e. g., the two new entities do not compete to each other) ...|$|E

La seconde partie traite principalement des conséquences du chômage sur les niveaux de vie, la sécurité, les besoins et les aspirations de la famille du salarié. Cet article fait partie d'une étude plus vaste sur les conditions de vie des travailleurs salariées de la Province de Québec. Cette étude est entreprise par le Centre de Recherches sociales de l'Université Laval, en collaboration avec la Fédération des Caisses Populaires Desjardins et l'Assurance-Vie Des jardins. The authors-wish {{to express}} their thanks to the Commission's staff who translated their original brief. An edited version appears here. Unemployment is a phenomenon which has been analyzed mostly in macro-economic terms. In the more usual studies an attempt is made to determine {{the size of the}} number of unemployed in relation to the total labour force, as well as the general causes of the increase in the percentage of unemployed. While we do not deny the importance of this approach, there remain a large number of micro-economic and sociological aspects which have received much less attention from the researchers, but which are also of great importance for economic planning. In the course of the study on living conditions of French-Canadian families we gathered data which enables us to examine unemployment among the workers of Quebec from certain angles. The research program is not centered on the unemployment problem, but rather on the living conditions of wage-earners, on the structure of the family budget, and on the needs and aspirations of families. For the purposes of the study, 1, 460 families distributed throughout the Province of Quebec were interviewed during the summer of 1959. The questionnaire used for those interviews furnished data on the family budget during one year (from the summer of 1958 until the summer of 1959). The population studied comprises all the complete families (married at least one year), of French origin that are families of wage-earners in the Province of Quebec. The sample was stratified according to the characteristics of the municipality in which the families live. Six different groups of families were formed in this way: (1) wage-earning families in the metropolitan centres (Montreal and Quebec); (2) families in towns with a population of over 30, 000; (3) families in towns with a population of between 5, 000 and 30, 000; (4) families living in villages of rural municipalities where agriculture is prosperous; (5) families in villages of rural municipalities where agriculture is average; (6) families in villages of municipalities where agriculture is poor. Before commenting at greater length on the implications of the high percentage of unemployed in rural areas, it is necessary to define the yardstick which we use to measure unemployment. This method {{is quite different from the}} measurement used by the government agencies. The Dominion Bureau of Statistics, as well as the Federal Unemployment Insurance Commission, measures the intensity of unemployment by calculating the percentage of the labour force that is without work at a given moment. Thus, we find that in November 1960, 6 per cent of the Canadian labour force was without work, whereas in October 1960, that percentage was 5 &. Those rates do not enable us to determine whether the workers who were unemployed in November had also been unemployed in October, nor the average duration of unemployment. The measurement which we use is different in two respects. Firstly, instead of taking the whole labour force into account, undifferentiated, we consider only those unemployed persons who are heads of families, that is, the workers whose instability of employment affects a large number of dependents. Secondly, we take into account the number of families whose heads have been unemployed at any time during the year between the summer of 1958 and the summer of 1959. Thus if it is found in our study that 29 per cent of French-Canadian wage-earning families were exposed to unemployment at some time during the year while the maximum monthly rate of unemployment (as compiled by the government agencies) was 5 per cent during that period, it can be deduced that the heads of families who were questioned were unemployed at different periods of the year. The average duration of unemployment per family (19 weeks) underlines the plausibility of this distribution of the phenomenon in terms of time. This method of measuring unemployment makes it possible to grasp more clearly the importance of under-employment in the Province of Quebec by laying bare certain phenomena that have been concealed by the other measurements. Thus, during the year 1958 - 1959, more than one-quarter of the wage-earning families of our sample were affected by unemployment at one time or other. That is a much larger proportion than one would gather from the official statistics. Furthermore, in the rural communities, unemployment affects between 30 per cent and 50 per cent of the families. The importance of unemployment is no doubt connected with the structure of occupation in the various communities. We can only present here a brief analysis of the characteristics of various industries and occupations in the urban and rural communities. A more thorough study would be necessary in order to situate the unemployment problem in its total context. DISTRIBUTION OF UNEMPLOYMENTThe percentage of families affected by unemployment increases as we move away from the large urban centres. The same relationship exists when we consider the percentage of families who have drawn unemployment insurance during the year. Even if it is the big cities which have the largest absolute number of unemployed, as the official statistics indicate, it is in those centres where their relative number is the smallest. In terms of probability, the urban worker is therefore less exposed to unemployment than his opposite number in the remote rural areas. The average length of the period of unemployment varies very little from one place to another. It is about four months. It is therefore not the duration of unemployment which varies from one community to the other, but rather the probability of becoming unemployed. The place of present residence is the chief factor associated with unemployment. Whatever his place of birth, the worker living in the rural community is more exposed to unemployment than the one living in the city. Moreover, the worker born in the urban community is less exposed to unemployment than the one who is born in the country. There is therefore reason to believe that the worker of city origin is better prepared to find steady employment. Finally, workers of rural origins, considerably decrease the probability of being unemployed by migrating to the city. It would seem important to verify this relationship with wider samples before accepting it absolutely. However, a brief analysis of the occupational structure in rural and urban communities may make it possible to explain in part the lower rate of unemployment that is characteristic of the urban community. We must bear in mind, first of all, that unemployment affects primarily the unskilled workers. This tendency has been shown by al! the studies on unemployment in Canada. In our population 90 per cent of the workers who were unemployed during the year were semi-skilled workers or labourers. It must also be remembered that in Canada seasonal unemployment is one of the main forms, if not the main form of unemployment. Moreover, the seasonal industries employ a very large number of unskilled workers (stevedores, lumber-cutters, construction labourers, transport labourers, etc.). The level of qualification of the rural workers is lower than that of the urban workers. That may be explained by their lower level of education, but also by the nature of the jobs which they can find in their community. The great majority of rural jobs are seasonal (bush work, transportation, construction work, road building, mining etc.) and require few qualifications. Moreover, the rural worker has difficulty finding a job in his locality. At least half of the rural workers must travel to their place of work. Quite often those journeys are so great that the worker is obliged to spend several days and even several weeks away from his home. Once he is out of work, the rural worker may therefore prefer to remain at home and draw unemployment insurance benefits before exiling himself once more in order to look for work. SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCESThe consequences of unemployment at the level of family life are fairly easy to predict. It is perhaps for that reason that few researchers have attempted to analyze them in terms of concrete examples. The systematic analysis of those consequences is, however, important if we wish to know the exact nature of this social evil, unemployment. The standard of living of families subject to unemployment is lower than that of other families. The available income per unit of consumption is decidedly lower. Half of the families where the head is out of work have an annual income of less than $ 900 per unit of consumption. The possession of the personal property common to French-Canadian homes is measured by an index. Families where there is unemployment own fewer house hold goods than other families. Thus, not only is current income lower, but the total investment in goods is lower too. From that it can be assumed that the precariousness of the economic situation is not a recent, accidental phenomenon, but a state which lasts for some time. It is perhaps in regard to the steps taken to insure the security of the family that the destitution of the unemployed is most pronounced. We built a security index: the items comprising that index are the possession of life insurance, health insurance, a pension plan, etc. Nearly half the families of unemployed workers have no guarantee of security in case of family disaster, while 74 per cent of the other families have an acceptable combination of insurance plans in case of unforeseen emergencies. The family of the unemployed worker therefore has to suffer not only from the hardships due to the lack of work, but is also vulnerable to all unforeseen calamities which may strike it. Another important point is, that the unemployed predict that owing to lack of money they will not be able to give their children the minimum of education which they consider necessary in our modern society. If this prediction comes true, the children, for lack of adequate preparation, will have to be employed as labourers or semi-skilled workers when they begin their careers. The probability of their becoming unemployed in their turn will therefore be fairly great (especially if we consider the future progress of automation). Unemployment may therefore easily become a heritage that is perpetuated from generation to generation. The fact that the unemployed have less chance to provide a sufficient income for their families in case of emergencies or illness is one indication of the difficulty they have in saving. Actually, the premiums of the various forms of insurance necessary for security of the family are savings which the unemployed person does not succeed in making. We find this inability to save when it comes to savings in the form of bank deposits or purchases of bonds. When the family exposed to unemployment does succeed in saving, it does so in order to provide against contingencies that are likely to occur soon. The families whose heads have a steady job ordinarily save for a more or less indefinite and remote purpose. The unemployed person who manages to save usually has to withdraw his savings to meet the necessities of daily life. For all the families exposed to unemployment, the indebtedness during a year is greater than the savings. ConclusionsThese few considerations on the geographical distribution of unemployment and on the socio-economic condition of the unemployed worker's family pose more problems, in fact, than they enable us to solve. Unemployment is a major economic and sociological problem. The politicians who seek to find a solution to it should, in our opinion, base themselves on research centred on two main poles. After defining the various types of unemployment (seasonal, structural, etc.,) they should determine the incidence of those types according to the economic regions, urban and rural communities, etc. This analysis should be accompanied by a structure-functional analysis of the regional economies. There no doubt exist some large-scale <b>economic</b> <b>remedies</b> for unemployment (increased exports, deficit budgeting, etc.). But to be really effective, most of those measures need an organic adaptation to the local situation. No doubt such measures also demand some co-ordination between the various sectors of industry and various levels of government. However, unemployment does not only have causes, it also has effects on the life of society, on family life and on the life of the individual. Our observations have enabled us to show that the whole phenomenon of unemployment does not strike just any workers, but rather particular classes of workers. Among heads of families, unemployment appears to be a more or less hereditary phenomenon in the less favoured environments. This is not an accident in the career of an individual, but rather a more or less permanent state peculiar to certain individuals. This permanence of unemployment at the individual level, is creating among us a real proletariat characterized by a very low standard of living, the total absence of security in case of emergencies, and the impossibility of aspiring to a better lot for future generations. It is important that this first analysis of the problem should be supplemented by an analysis of the effects of unemployment on the single worker. Likewise, it would be important to determine the implications both for the family and for the single person of various types of unemployment. Such research would make it possible not only to prepare programs of economic expansion and of co-ordination of industries, but also to ensure greater economic and social security through the adoption of measures proportionate to the needs of the various types of workers. Thus, it would be possible, we hope, to nip this emerging proletariat in the bud...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Oxidative {{stress is}} {{imperative}} for its morbidity towards diabetic complications, where abnormal metabolic milieu {{as a result}} of hyperglycemia, leads to the onset of several complications. A biological antioxidant capable of inhibiting oxidative stress mediated diabetic progressions; during hyperglycemia is still the need of the era. The current study was performed to study the effect of biologically synthesized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to control the hyperglycemic conditions in streptozotocin induced diabetic mice. Results The profound control of AuNPs over the anti oxidant enzymes such as GSH, SOD, Catalase and GPx in diabetic mice to normal, by inhibition of lipid peroxidation and ROS generation during hyperglycemia evidence their anti-oxidant effect during hyperglycemia. The AuNPs exhibited an insistent control over the blood glucose level, lipids and serum biochemical profiles in diabetic mice near to the control mice provokes their effective role in controlling and increasing the organ functions for better utilization of blood glucose. Histopathological and hematological studies revealed the non-toxic and protective effect of the gold nanoparticles over the vital organs when administered at dosage of 2. 5 mg/kilogram. body. weight/day. ICP-MS analysis revealed the biodistribution of gold nanoparticles in the vital organs showing accumulation of AuNPs in the spleen comparatively greater than other organs. Conclusion The results obtained disclose the effectual role of AuNPs as an anti-oxidative agent, by inhibiting the formation of ROS, scavenging free radicals; thus increasing the anti-oxidant defense enzymes and creating a sustained control over hyperglycemic conditions which consequently evoke the potential of AuNPs as an <b>economic</b> therapeutic <b>remedy</b> in diabetic treatments and its complications. </p...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Workplace spirituality {{research}} has side-stepped religion {{by focusing on}} the function of belief rather than its substance. Although establishing a unified foundation for research, the functional approach cannot shed light on issues of workplace pluralism, individual or institutional faith-work integration, or the institutional roles of religion in <b>economic</b> activity. To <b>remedy</b> this, we revisit definitions of spirituality and argue for the place of a belief-based approach to workplace religion. Addi-tionally, we describe the construction of a 15 -item measure of workplace religion informed by Judaism and Christianity – the Faith at Work Scale (FWS). A stratified random sample (n = 234) of managers and professionals assisted in refining the FWS which exhibits a single factor structure (Eigenvalue = 8. 88; variance accounted for = 59. 22 %) that is internally consistent (Cronbach’s a = 0. 77) and demonstrates convergent validity with the Faith Maturity Scale (r = 0. 81, p> 0. 0001). The scale shows lower skew and kurtosis with Mainline and Catholic adherents than with Mormons and Evangelicals. Validation of the scale among Jewish and diverse Christian adherants would extend research in workplace religion...|$|R
40|$|<b>Economic</b> analysts of <b>remedies</b> {{often use}} {{nuisance}} cases as examples to illustrate their models. The illustrations commonly suppose that parties to such cases will {{be interested in}} bargaining after judgment if the court fails to award {{the rights to the}} party willing to pay the most for them. Professor Farnsworth examines twenty nuisance cases and finds no bargaining after judgment in any of them; nor did the parties 2 ̆ 7 lawyers believe that bargaining would have occurred if judgment had been given to the loser. The lawyers said that the possibility of such bargaining was foreclosed not by the sorts of transaction costs that usually are the subject of economic models, but by animosity between the parties and by their distaste for cash bargaining over the rights at issue. Professor Farnsworth suggests that these results raise a number of interesting questions, such as how the obstacles to bargaining in these cases might be related to the absence of markets for the rights at stake, whether animosity or a distaste for bargaining should be considered transaction costs, and whether greater particularity might be needed before economic models can generate advice about remedies reliable enough to be useful to courts...|$|R
40|$|This study {{rejects the}} {{conventional}} wisdom that the Chinese commune was an <b>economic</b> failure <b>remedied</b> by decollectivization. Instead, it argues that over time improvements in the institution's remuneration and agricultural research and extension systems began a rural development process that substantially increased agricultural output over a sustained period. It uses national and provincial level data and applies basic insights from both the classical and neoclassical economic traditions to show how changes made to the commune beginning in 1970 contributed to increased rural economic development and improved agricultural output. The commune's coercive extraction of household resources financed agricultural capital accumulation and the development of technological innovations, which increased output, thus generating the agricultural surpluses needed to kick-start a long-run cycle of productive investment and sustained output growth. Although the commune system kept rural households living in austere - often subsistence-level - conditions, it succeeded in increasing rural development and the rate of technical innovation in agriculture, and, in turn, agricultural productivity per unit land and per unit labor. Simply put, it was under the commune {{that for the first time}} in history hundreds of millions of rural Chinese acquired the basic skills and capital necessary to get their foot on the first rung of the development ladder. China's new leadership abandoned the commune for distinctly political reasons. An alliance of rightists and liberal reformers led by Deng Xiaoping destroyed the system to consolidate their newfound political power. The campaign to abandon the commune gained momentum throughout the late 1970 s culminating with the system's gradual elimination between 1979 and 1983. Unified by anti-leftism and a desire to solidify their tenuous grip on power, Deng's coalition set out to boost rural household incomes, end Maoism, and modernize the military. Each of these three interrelated policy goals removed one "leg" of the commune's tripartite economic, political and military support structure: its mandate to extract household savings for capital investment, its cohesive collectivist ideology, and military political backing, respectively. Without these supports the system collapsed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{challenges}} the neoclassical and the state-oriented views on economic and industrial development, using a strategic decision making theory framework and {{by focusing on}} the changing governance of the Korean water sector as an in-depth case. This research finds that a governance structure controlled by a few elites from the market or the state inevitably fails to meet the public interest. Strategic decision making theory (SDT) in this research incorporates Barzelay’s institutional processualism (Barzelay, 2003, Barzelay and Gallego, 2006) and Moe’s concept of purposive incentive (1981), in order to explain ‘changing’ governance and the reasons why some actors voluntarily participate in democratic decision making despite ‘collective action problems’. The Korean water sector, the case of this research, illustrates these ideas by showing that governance changes result from intense interaction between interested and purposive actors, critical events, and context. SDT analysis is complemented by an econometric analysis, which shows that the decentralisation of decision making power does not necessarily come with better performance unless proper governance is introduced. Solutions suggested in this thesis are democratic industrial governance and, as an intermediate means, a democratic regulatory agency, which is beyond merely (<b>economic)</b> regulation to <b>remedy</b> ‘market failure’ and economic bureaucrats pursuing long term career path.

40|$|Local user {{perceptions}} of resource trajectory and indicators of protected area outcomes {{can be useful}} in the assessment of integrated conservation projects, both marine and terrestrial. In-depth stakeholder surveys using 12 performance indicators were used to evaluate the perceived outcomes of the Sagay Marine Reserve (SMR), the Philippines. These indicators were a measure of whether the SMR had achieved its management objectives in the recent past and what local stakeholders expected in the future. The respondents contextual situation could be correlated with their {{perceptions of}} SMR indicators. There was a generally high level of perceived equity and efficiency of SMR management outcomes, but the sustainability of the SMR, particularly the condition of the fisheries, had been poor over the previous 10 years. Few anticipated an improvement in sustainability indicators over the next 10 years. Respondents from an island village within the SMR had more negative (or less positive) perceptions of SMR outcomes because of their high dependence on the degraded resource, combined with physical and <b>economic</b> isolation. Specific <b>remedies</b> to enhance island villagers satisfaction, such as greater participation, empowerment, alternative economic opportunities and fisheries protection, and replenishment, are necessary. This research serves {{as an example of how}} indicators perceived by local resource-accessing stakeholders can and should be main components of both marine and terrestrial protected area assessment...|$|R
40|$|Criminal {{and civil}} law differ greatly {{in their use}} of the element of intent. The {{purposes}} of intent in each legal system are tailored to effectuate very different goals. The Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s recent decision in Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S. A., 131 S. Ct. 2060 (2011), however, imported a criminal concept of intent [...] willful blindness [...] into the statute for patent infringement, a civil offense. This importation of a criminal law concept of intent into the patent statute is novel and calls for examination. This Article compares the purposes behind intent in criminal law with the purposes behind intent in patent law to demonstrate that this importation does not achieve the policy goals of the patent regime. Criminal law jurisprudence requires an intent element for three reasons: to ascribe a level of moral blameworthiness to an act, to separate criminal from civil liability, and to shield otherwise innocently acting defendants from criminal punishment. Patent infringement actions, by contrast, lack an intent element because they almost exclusively seek to <b>remedy</b> <b>economic</b> harms. The importation of criminal concepts of knowledge into the patent infringement statute may therefore lead to unwanted consequences, particularly, higher-than-warranted burdens of proof for patent holders. To this end, equating criminal mental states to civil ones risks treating patent infringement as criminal conduct. This Article concludes by proposing that courts should examine the purposes of mental state requirements on a statute-by-statute basis...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I look at unions 2 ̆ 7 future using a {{historical}} perspective and focusing on the period of union ascendancy {{as well as the}} past few decades when unions have been in decline. We know trends currently in place are unfavorable to unions. What conditions would be favorable? The rise of unions from the 1930 s through the early 1950 s was due to the convergence of a number of events - an economic policy that attempted to restrict competition beginning in the 1930 s, the twin beliefs that labor markets were inherently noncompetitive and/or that individual workplaces were exploitative, and low union premiums. The passage of highly favorable legislation, {{in the form of the}} Wagner Act, was a reflection of the idea that unions could actually improve the functioning of labor markets and serve as a countervailing power to big business. Over the past several decades, union density declined because government policy became pro-competitive, it became clearer that labor markets were relatively competitive, HR practices developed that reduced the amount of opportunistic behavior of employers, and unions increased the percentage premium they enjoyed in industries where rents were available. In this environment, the public-good aspect of labor unions - their ability to improve the functioning of labor markets - was called into question. The passage of amendments to the NLRA that were unfavorable to unions was a reflection of this changed sentiment as to the public good aspect of unions as well as to the adoption of pro-competitive market policies in general. Consequently the future trend in union density will depend on the competitiveness of the economy and on the related question of the number of opportunities for unions to fulfill their major goal of either extracting <b>economic</b> rents or <b>remedying</b> market failures that result in exploitative employment relationships...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2008. Major: Political Science. Advisor: Professor James Farr. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); iv, 200 pages. My dissertation addresses the political problem of economic inequality, through a conceptual {{history of the}} phrase “equal opportunity,” and {{an evaluation of the}} role equal opportunity has played in debates about how (or even whether) to <b>remedy</b> <b>economic</b> inequalities. I analyzed thousands of U. S. newspapers spanning over 90 years to identify how different conceptual uses affected policy decisions made at different key periods in American history. From the Gilded Age, when reform advocates pushed equal opportunity into mainstream newspaper debates for the first time, to the 1960 s when political actors made equal opportunity the preferred way to talk about most inequalities, political actors and analysts increasingly used equal opportunity as the criterion for identifying unjust inequalities that required political attention. Equal opportunity has been institutionalized in American law, governmental regulations, and popular discourse through events such as the 1954 Brown Supreme Court decision and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Despite these policy advances, and despite the solidity of support for equal opportunity in American political thought and popular discourse, I argue that the concept has ironically impeded efforts to address economic inequality. This is because equal opportunity invokes a metaphor that obscures the most important sources of economic inequality. Equal opportunity functions by invoking the metaphor of everyone being permitted to compete in a race. Yet most political interventions to address economic inequalities focus on historical and institutional disadvantages in laws passed in previous years. Arguing that reforms should “make up the lost ground” such disadvantages imposed under the rubric of a competitive race, however, violates Americans’ basic everyday understanding of fair competition. We do not give runners in a race a head start because they were born into poverty and had worse nutrition and we do not give a basketball team more points to start a game because they have fewer taller players. While equal opportunity provided many American political actors with an effective conceptual frame to fight some forms of discriminations, it was nonetheless ill-suited practically and normatively to address economic inequality...|$|R
5000|$|Piercing the {{corporate}} veil16. I should {{first of all}} {{draw attention to the}} limited sense in which this issue arises at all. [...] "Piercing {{the corporate}} veil" [...] is an expression rather indiscriminately used to describe a number of different things. Properly speaking, it means disregarding the separate personality of the company. There is a range of situations in which the law attributes the acts or property of a company to those who control it, without disregarding its separate legal personality. The controller may be personally liable, generally in addition to the company, for something that he has done as its agent or as a joint actor. Property legally vested in a company may belong beneficially to the controller, if the arrangements in relation to the property are such as to make the company its controller's nominee or trustee for that purpose. For specific statutory purposes, a company's legal responsibility may be engaged by the acts or business of an associated company. Examples are the provisions of the Companies Acts governing group accounts or the rules governing infringements of competition law by [...] "firms", which may include groups of companies conducting the relevant business as an <b>economic</b> unit. Equitable <b>remedies,</b> such as an injunction or specific performance may be available to compel the controller whose personal legal responsibility is engaged to exercise his control in a particular way. But when we speak of piercing the corporate veil, we are not (or should not be) speaking of any of these situations, but only of those cases which are true exceptions to the rule in Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd, i.e. where a person who owns and controls a company is said in certain circumstances to be identified with it in law by virtue of that ownership and control. 17. Most advanced legal systems recognise corporate legal personality while acknowledging some limits to its logical implications. In civil law jurisdictions, the juridical basis of the exceptions is generally the concept of abuse of rights, to which the International Court of Justice was referring in In re Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Co Ltd when it derived from municipal law a limited principle permitting the piercing of the corporate veil in cases of misuse, fraud, malfeasance or evasion of legal obligations. These examples illustrate the breadth, at least as a matter of legal theory, of the concept of abuse of rights, which extends not just to the illegal and improper invocation of a right but to its use for some purpose collateral to that for which it exists.18. English law has no general doctrine of this kind. But it has a variety of specific principles which achieve the same result in some cases. One of these principles is that the law defines the incidents of most legal relationships between persons (natural or artificial) on the fundamental assumption that their dealings are honest. The same legal incidents will not necessarily apply if they are not. The principle was stated in its most absolute form by Denning LJ in a famous dictum in Lazarus Estates Ltd v Beasley:"No court in this land will allow a person to keep an advantage which he has obtained by fraud. No judgment of a court, no order of a Minister, can be allowed to stand if it has been obtained by fraud. Fraud unravels everything. The court is careful not to find fraud unless it is distinctly pleaded and proved; but once it is proved, it vitiates judgments, contracts and all transactions whatsoever…"The principle is mainly familiar in the context of contracts and other consensual arrangements, in which the effect of fraud is to vitiate consent so that the transaction becomes voidable ab initio. But it has been applied altogether more generally, in cases which can be rationalised only on grounds of public policy, for example to justify setting aside a public act such as a judgment, which is in no sense consensual, a jurisdiction which has existed since at least 1775. Or to abrogate a right derived from a legal status, such as marriage. Or to disapply a statutory time bar which {{on the face of the}} statute applies. These decisions (and there are others) illustrate a broader principle governing cases in which the benefit of some apparently absolute legal principle has been obtained by dishonesty. The authorities show that there are limited circumstances in which the law treats the use of a company as a means of evading the law as dishonest for this purpose....34. These considerations reflect the broader principle that the corporate veil may be pierced only to prevent the abuse of corporate legal personality. It may be an abuse of the separate legal personality of a company to use it to evade the law or to frustrate its enforcement. It is not an abuse to cause a legal liability to be incurred by the company in the first place. It is not an abuse to rely upon the fact (if it is a fact) that a liability is not the controller's because it is the company's. On the contrary, that is what incorporation is all about....35. I conclude that there is a limited principle of English law which applies when a person is under an existing legal obligation or liability or subject to an existing legal restriction which he deliberately evades or whose enforcement he deliberately frustrates by interposing a company under his control. The court may then pierce the corporate veil for the purpose, and only for the purpose, of depriving the company or its controller of the advantage that they would otherwise have obtained by the company's separate legal personality. The principle is properly described as a limited one, because in almost every case where the test is satisfied, the facts will in practice disclose a legal relationship between the company and its controller which will make it unnecessary to pierce the corporate veil....52. Whether assets legally vested in a company are beneficially owned by its controller is a highly fact-specific issue. It is not possible to give general guidance going beyond the ordinary principles and presumptions of equity, especially those relating to gifts and resulting trusts. But I venture to suggest, however tentatively, that in the case of the matrimonial home, the facts are quite likely to justify the inference that the property was held on trust for a spouse who owned and controlled the company. In many, perhaps most cases, the occupation of the company's property as the matrimonial home of its controller will not be easily justified in the company's interest, especially if it is gratuitous. The intention will normally be that the spouse in control of the company intends to retain a degree of control over the matrimonial home which is not consistent with the company's beneficial ownership. Of course, structures can be devised which give a different impression, and some of them will be entirely genuine. But where, say, the terms of acquisition and occupation of the matrimonial home are arranged between the husband in his personal capacity and the husband in his capacity as the sole effective agent of the company (or someone else acting at his direction), judges exercising family jurisdiction are entitled to be sceptical about whether the terms of occupation are really what they are said to be, or are simply a sham to conceal the reality of the husband's beneficial ownership.|$|R
