5|$|Shortly thereafter, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 {{may have}} raised again {{the issue of}} which court would hear cases such as Hamdan's. The U.S. Department of Justice has filed notice with several <b>federal</b> <b>judges,</b> and given notice to {{hundreds}} of detainees, that the habeas petitions of alien unlawful enemy combatants (or those whose status is to be determined) are not within the jurisdiction of those courts.|$|E
5|$|Since {{there were}} no sitting justices at the {{beginning}} of Washington's term, he had the unique opportunity to fill the entire body of United States <b>federal</b> <b>judges</b> with his selections. Despite this, Washington appointed only 28 judges to the United States district courts, due to the smaller size of the judiciary at the time; there were far fewer states, most states had a single district court, and each district had a single judge assigned to it. Because intermediate federal appellate courts had not yet been established, this, combined with the Supreme Court appointments, constituted the total number of federal judicial appointments made by Washington. The number is roughly 10% of the record 376 judges appointed by Ronald Reagan from 1980 to 1988, when the judiciary was much larger, and less than 5% of the number of active <b>federal</b> <b>judges</b> serving as of July 2010. Richard Peters, Jr. served for over 36 years, the longest of Washington's appointments.|$|E
5|$|<b>Federal</b> <b>judges,</b> when {{interpreting}} the Constitution, frequently use The Federalist Papers as a contemporary {{account of the}} intentions of the framers and ratifiers. They have been applied on issues ranging from the power of the federal government in foreign affairs (in Hines v. Davidowitz) to the validity of ex post facto laws (in the 1798 decision Calder v. Bull, apparently the first decision to mention The Federalist). , The Federalist had been quoted 291 times in Supreme Court decisions.|$|E

5|$|Loughner {{was held}} in the Federal Correctional Institution at Phoenix without bail. All Arizona-based <b>federal</b> <b>judges</b> recused {{themselves}} from the case because of their ties to Judge Roll, who was killed in the attack.

The public defender Judy Clarke, also based in San Diego, was appointed to represent Loughner in federal court.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the point}} at which {{explicit}} constitutional authority for the creation of federal crimes runs out. But the statute went on to define additional crimes: theft or falsification of court records, perjury, bribery of <b>federal</b> <b>judges,</b> interference with judicial process, and liberation of federal prisoners. All of these were plainly necessary and proper to the operation of the federal courts; Marshall was to cite the perjury section as precedent for the existence of implicit powers in M'Culloch v. Maryland.|$|E
5|$|United States President George Washington {{appointed}} 38 United States <b>federal</b> <b>judges</b> {{during his}} presidency, which lasted from April 30, 1789 to March 4, 1797. The {{first group of}} Washington's appointments—two justices of the Supreme Court of the United States and ten district court judges—began service two days after Congress passed the Judiciary Act of 1789, which formally established the federal judiciary. Washington's last court appointee received his commission twelve days {{before the end of}} Washington's presidency.|$|E

5|$|As more {{information}} about Burge's reign was published, activists worked to save some Chicago inmates on death row {{who claimed to have}} been wrongfully convicted. In 1998, representatives from the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Chicago Law School, the London-based International Center for Criminal Law and Human Rights, law professor Anthony Amsterdam, former <b>federal</b> <b>judges</b> George N. Leighton and Abner Mikva, Illinois judge R. Eugene Pincham, and British activist Bianca Jagger, called for a stay of execution for Aaron Patterson, a death row inmate from Chicago. His conviction for murder was based primarily on a confession which he claimed was coerced by torture from Burge and his officers.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{appointed}} nine Article III <b>federal</b> <b>judges</b> {{during his}} presidency, all to United States district courts; {{he did not}} appoint a justice {{to serve on the}} Supreme Court. In April 1866, he nominated Henry Stanbery to fill the vacancy left with the death of John Catron, but Congress eliminated the seat to prevent the appointment, and to ensure that he did not get to make any appointments eliminated the next vacancy as well, providing that the court would shrink by one justice when one next departed from office. Johnson appointed his Greeneville crony, Samuel Milligan, to the United States Court of Claims, where he served from 1868 until his death in 1874.|$|E
5|$|More {{arose from}} the same Federalist/Jeffersonian {{political}} dispute over the judiciary {{that gave rise to}} Marbury v. Madison (1803) and Stuart v. Laird (1803). Benjamin More, a justice of the peace in the District of Columbia, argued that the repeal of statutory provisions authorizing compensation for his office violated the salary-protection guarantees for <b>federal</b> <b>judges</b> in Article Three of the United States Constitution. Below, a divided panel of the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia had sided with More, interpreted the repeal act prospectively, and sustained his demurrer to the criminal indictment for the common law crime of exacting illegal fees under color of office.|$|E

5|$|Once the Speaker {{election}} {{had concluded}} and Congress {{was ready to}} conduct legislative business, the issue of slavery took center stage. Northerners sought to admit California, a free state, to the Union. Kentucky's Henry Clay introduced in the Senate a series of resolutions, the Compromise of 1850, to admit California and pass legislation sought by each side. Johnson voted for all the provisions except for {{the abolition of slavery}} in the nation's capital. He pressed resolutions for constitutional amendments to provide for popular election of senators (then elected by state legislatures) and of the president (chosen by the Electoral College), and limiting the tenure of <b>federal</b> <b>judges</b> to 12 years. These were all defeated.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the efforts}} to achieve {{geographic}} balance, nineteen states have never produced a Supreme Court Justice. Some states have been over-represented (although partly because there were fewer states from which early justices could be appointed), with New York producing fifteen justices, Ohio producing ten, Massachusetts nine, Virginia eight, six each from Pennsylvania and Tennessee, and five from Kentucky, Maryland, and New Jersey. A handful of justices were born outside the United States, mostly from among the earliest justices on the Court. These included James Wilson, born in Fife, Scotland; James Iredell, born in Lewes, England; and William Paterson, born in County Antrim, Ireland. Justice David Josiah Brewer was born farthest from the U.S., in Smyrna, in the Ottoman Empire, (now İzmir, Turkey). George Sutherland was born in Buckinghamshire, England. The last foreign-born Justice, {{and the only one}} of these for whom English was a second language, was Felix Frankfurter, born in Vienna, Austria.

5|$|In 1848, {{with the}} rise of {{interest}} in the bell, the city decided to move it to the Assembly Room (also known as the Declaration Chamber) on the first floor, where the Declaration and United States Constitution had been debated and signed. The city constructed an ornate pedestal for the bell. The Liberty Bell was displayed on that pedestal for the next quarter-century, surmounted by an eagle (originally sculpted, later stuffed). In 1853, President Franklin Pierce visited Philadelphia and the bell, and spoke of the bell as symbolizing the American Revolution and American liberty. At the time, Independence Hall was also used as a courthouse, and African-American newspapers pointed out the incongruity of housing a symbol of liberty in the same building in which <b>federal</b> <b>judges</b> were holding hearings under the Fugitive Slave Act.|$|E

5|$|Pierce {{sought to}} run a more {{efficient}} and accountable government than his predecessors. His Cabinet members implemented an early system of civil service examinations which was a forerunner to the Pendleton Act passed three decades later. The Interior Department was reformed by Secretary Robert McClelland, who systematized its operations, expanded the use of paper records, and pursued fraud. Another of Pierce's reforms was to expand {{the role of the}} U.S. attorney general in appointing <b>federal</b> <b>judges</b> and attorneys, which was an important step in the eventual development of the Justice Department. There was a vacancy on the Supreme Court—Fillmore, having failed to get Senate confirmation for his nominees, had offered it to newly elected Louisiana Senator Judah P. Benjamin, who had declined. Pierce also offered the seat to Benjamin, and when the Louisianan persisted in his refusal, nominated instead John Archibald Campbell, an advocate of states' rights; this would be Pierce's only Supreme Court appointment.|$|E
5|$|Scalia {{maintained}} that every element of {{an offense that}} helps determine the sentence must be either admitted by the defendant or found by a jury under the Sixth Amendment's jury guarantee. In the 2000 case of Apprendi v. New Jersey, Scalia wrote the Court's majority opinion that struck down a state statute that allowed the trial judge to increase the sentence if the judge found the offense was a hate crime. Scalia found the procedure impermissible because {{whether it was a}} hate crime had not been decided by the jury. In 2004, he wrote for the Court in Blakely v. Washington, striking down Washington state's sentencing guidelines on similar grounds. The dissenters in Blakely foresaw that Scalia would use the case to attack the federal sentencing guidelines (which he had failed to strike down in Mistretta), and they proved correct, as Scalia led a five-member majority in United States v. Booker, which made those guidelines no longer mandatory for <b>federal</b> <b>judges</b> to follow (they remained advisory).|$|E
