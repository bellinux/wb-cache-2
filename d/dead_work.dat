6000|$|Second. Is the {{salvation}} of the sinner {{by the grace of}} God? Then here you see the reason why some sinners, that were wonderfully averse to conversion by nature, are yet made to stoop to the God of their salvation. Grace takes them to do, because grace hath designed them to this very thing. Hence some of the Gentiles were taken from among the rest; God granted them repentance unto life, because he had taken them from among the rest, both by election and calling, for his name (Acts 11:18; 15:14). These men that were not a people, are thus become the people of God; these men that were not beloved for their works, were yet beloved by the grace of God. [...] "I will call them my people which were not my people; and her beloved which was not beloved." [...] But their minds are averse. But are they the people on whom God doth magnify the riches of his grace? Why, then, they shall be, in the day of his power, made willing, and be able to believe through grace (Psa 110:3; Rom 9:25; Acts 18:27). But doth the guilt and burden of sin so keep them down that they can by no means lift up themselves? Why, God will, by the exceeding greatness of that power by which he raised Christ from the <b>dead,</b> <b>work</b> in their souls also by the Spirit of grace, to cause them to believe and to walk in his ways (Eph 1:18-20).|$|E

Now if faith in this blood doth sprinkle the conscience, and so doth purge it from all <b>dead</b> <b>works,</b> then must faith go first to the blood of Christ for justification, and must bring this home to the defiled conscience, before it be delivered from those <b>dead</b> <b>works</b> that are in it, and made capable of serving the living God (Rom 5:7-10, 3:24,25; Heb 9:14, 10:19-22).|$|R

40|$|The ancient way {{of cooking}} : Apicius in the Middle Ages - Assembled {{in the late}} fourth century, the {{cookbook}} which tradition has attributed to Apicius had a predominantly medieval destiny. Serving as a practical and living text until the sixth century, it became known from that time onward as a purely literary and <b>dead</b> <b>work.</b> This was notably the case during the Carolingian Renaissance, when the scriptoria of Tours and of Fulda produced manuscripts of the cookbook and where, it seems, Loup de Ferrières, {{as well as all}} those who were inspired by it, used Apicius' text. It was afterwards practically forgotten, until its rediscovery in the fifteenth century by the humanists. The credit for this is due not to Poggio, but to Enoch of Ascoli, who brought a manuscript back to Italy. The rediscovery, however, had only a limited influence, {{with the exception of the}} Roman Academy of Pomponio Leto, where Apicius was used notably by Platina to define his humanist gastronomy.

40|$|Hardy’s Mines Ltd {{was formed}} on 30 April l 904 to acquire all Edwin Henry Hardy’s mining properties. Because of his experience, Hardy was to {{supervise}} the work {{for the first three}} years of the company’s existence. Details are provided of the directors and shareholders, who included experienced businessmen from many places in New Zealand. Immediately upon its formation, the company had to undertake a considerable amount of <b>dead</b> <b>work</b> and to improve the battery before it could extract and process the ore. Much prospecting and testing was done, but only a small amount of gold was treated. Nevertheless, hopes were high during 1904 and 1905, and concentrates were tested in Australia. Being, as was the norm, under-capitalized, increasingly the company faced financial difficulties, and in 1906 most work ceased and the mines were protected because the payable ore had run out. In that year, Hardy ceased to be the supervisor. Exploration had proved that the lode below where he had extracted good ore was unpayable, being increasingly refractory and therefore expensive to treat. Once the capital was exhausted, further capital was sought, including in England. The company was reconstructed in 1907, but continued to be under-capitalized. It was hoped that a new low-level drive, known as McLean’s level, would strike good ore below the existing Colonist workings, but driving this took several years and the hoped-for valuable ore did not exist. A new company was formed in 1910, which continued to extend McLean’s level and to test any ore struck, all the while hoping to sell its property. Although mining had ceased, some income was received through treating the tailings using cyanide. When it was discovered that the mine manager had extended McLean’s level in the wrong direction, this work was abandoned, especially because assays revealed that earlier ones had been ‘misleading’. The company abandoned its property in 1924...|$|E
40|$|Historicamente, verificamos a dualidade educacional em que temos uma formaÃÃo voltada para as elites dirigentes e outra para os trabalhadores que atuam no processo de produÃÃo capitalista. No entanto, na expansÃo do capitalismo nas Ãltimas quatro dÃcadas, identificamos, assim como jÃ tinha antecipado Karl Marx, a intensificaÃÃo da substituiÃÃo do trabalho vivo (o ser humano) pelo trabalho morto (as mÃquinas), ocasionando uma crise, pois o mercado jÃ nÃo absorve tantos trabalhadores no processo produtivo. O desemprego, portanto, Ã uma realidade que assusta atÃ mesmo os organismos internacionais, como a OrganizaÃÃo das NaÃÃes Unidas (ONU). Neste contexto, a empregabilidade, em um mundo sem emprego, e a teoria do capital humano surgem como novas formas de dominaÃÃo social, internalizando no indivÃduo a ideia de que Ã ele o responsÃvel por sua situaÃÃo econÃmica precÃria. Neste sentido, analisamos nesta pesquisa a formaÃÃo de trabalhadores desencadeada pelo Centro Vocacional TecnolÃgico (CVT), por meio de cursos de formaÃÃo inicial ou qualificaÃÃo profissional na comunidade de Umarizeiras, distrito de Maranguape, municÃpio da RegiÃo Metropolitana de Fortaleza (RMF), apontando as contradiÃÃes impostas pelo capitalismo contemporÃneo, que limitam aquela atuaÃÃo. A investigaÃÃo foi realizada a partir da articulaÃÃo de fontes orais, atravÃs de entrevistas com 13 (treze) moradores; e documentais: apostilas dos cursos disponibilizadas pelo CVT e o Estatuto da AssociaÃÃo de Moradores de Umarizeiras, o que nos permitiu colocar em evidÃncia as contradiÃÃes entre o discurso oficial e a realidade vivenciada pelos sujeitos envolvidos naquela formaÃÃo. Os cursos ofertados pelo CVT Ãquela comunidade foram: processamento de polpas, criaÃÃo de galinha caipira, E. V. A., informÃtica, doces de frutas e associativismo. A maioria dos entrevistados jÃ havia participado de um ou mais cursos, motivados pelo objetivo imediato da conquista de um emprego, fato que constatamos nÃo se realizar; sobre os conhecimentos adquiridos nos cursos, raros sÃo os que afirmam utilizarem em seu cotidiano. Conclui-se, portanto, que a oferta dos cursos cumpre mais um objetivo ideolÃgico com a funÃÃo de culpar o indivÃduo pela sua situaÃÃo econÃmica do que uma formaÃÃo {{integral}} de ser humano, tendo o trabalho como princÃpio educativo. Historically, we can {{verify the}} educational duality {{in which we}} have a formation oriented to the ruling Ãlite and another one oriented to the workers who act in the capitalist production process. However, the expansion of the capitalism in the last four decades, we identify, as Karl Marx had already previewed, the intensification of the substitution of the living work (the human being) for the <b>dead</b> <b>work</b> (machines), causing crisis, because the market doesnât absorb so many workers in the production process. Therefore, the unemployment, is a reality that scares even the international organizations, like the United Nations (UN). In this context, the employability, in a world without jobs and the human capital theory emerge as new forms of social domination, internalizing in the individual the idea that he is the responsible for his precarious economic situation. In this regard, in this research we analyzed the formation of workers released by Centro Vocacional TecnolÃgico (CVT) â Technologic Vocational Center â through means of initial formation courses or professional qualification in the community of Umarizeiras, in Maranguape, town in the Metropolitan Region of Fortaleza, pointing contradictions imposed by the contemporary capitalism which limit that performance. The investigation took place with oral sources, through interviews with thirteen dwellers; and documents: booklets of the courses available by CVT and Estatuto da AssociaÃÃo de Moradores de Umazeira, which let us highlight the contradictions between the official speech and the reality lived by the subjects involved in that formation. The available courses by CVT to that community were fruit pulp process, chicken raising, E. V. A., computing, fruit sweets. All the interviewed subjects had already participated in one or more courses, motivated by the immediate objective of getting a job, fact that doesnÂt really happen; about the knowledge acquired in the courses, itâs rare to find someone who uses it in the daily life. We conclude, therefore, that the offer of the courses achieves rather an ideological objective, targeting to blame the individuals for their economic situation than a whole formation of the human being, having work as the educational principle...|$|E
