5|$|Examination by {{a severe}} weather {{team from the}} Bureau of Meteorology {{examined}} the damage in the Bucca and Kolan region and recorded it as an 'F4' on the Fujita scale.

Travelling at the orbital speed of the Space Shuttle (8 kilometres per second—almost 30,000 <b>kilometres</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour),</b> it would take about 150,000 years to arrive. km / (3 × 104 km/h × 24 × 365.25) = 1.5 × 105 years.

5|$|Thermal inertia and the {{transfer}} of heat by winds in the lower atmosphere mean that the temperature of Venus's surface does not vary significantly between the night and day sides, despite Venus's extremely slow rotation. Winds at the surface are slow, moving at a few <b>kilometres</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour,</b> {{but because of the}} high density of the atmosphere at the surface, they exert a significant amount of force against obstructions, and transport dust and small stones across the surface. This alone would make it difficult for a human to walk through, even if the heat, pressure, and lack of oxygen were not a problem.|$|E
5|$|The {{circulation}} in Venus's troposphere follows the so-called cyclostrophic approximation. Its windspeeds are roughly {{determined by the}} balance of the pressure gradient and centrifugal forces in almost purely zonal flow. In contrast, the {{circulation in}} the Earth's atmosphere is governed by the geostrophic balance. Venus's windspeeds can be directly measured only in the upper troposphere (tropopause), between 60–70km, altitude, which corresponds to the upper cloud deck. The cloud motion is usually observed in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, where the contrast between clouds is the highest. The linear wind speeds at this level are about 100±10m/s at lower than 50° latitude. They are retrograde {{in the sense that they}} blow in the direction of the retrograde rotation of the planet. The winds quickly decrease towards the higher latitudes, eventually reaching zero at the poles. Such strong cloud-top winds cause a phenomenon known as the super-rotation of the atmosphere. In other words, these high-speed winds circle the whole planet faster than the planet itself rotates. The super-rotation on Venus is differential, which means that the equatorial troposphere super-rotates more slowly than the troposphere at the midlatitudes. The winds also have a strong vertical gradient. They decline deep in the troposphere with the rate of 3m/sperkm. The winds near the surface of Venus are much slower than that on Earth. They actually move at only a few <b>kilometres</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> (generally less than 2m/s and with an average of 0.3 to 1.0m/s), but due to the high density of the atmosphere at the surface, this is still enough to transport dust and small stones across the surface, much like a slow-moving current of water.|$|E

40|$|In the {{underground}} mining industry, {{one of the}} long-term operational issues involves longer haulage routes as the mine gets deeper with the life of mine. This longer travel route has {{a great impact on}} the productivity and cost of the operation. Choosing the best haulage fleet will result in improved productivity and lower cost per tonne of material moved. For this reason, it has motivated Daisy Milano Gold Mine, owned by Silver Lake Resources, to analyse their current Toro 50 Plus trucks against the Atlas Copco MT 5010 truck. During a three month trial of both haulage options, trucking parameters were collected from a specifically designed trucking plod. This research used a time motion study to perform productivity calculations and cost analysis of the two haulage options. Based on the assumptions made in this research, the conclusion is that the Atlas Copco MT 5010 should be utilised as the preferred truck option at Daisy Milano.

25|$|In 1994, Judy Massare {{concluded}} that ichthyosaurs {{had been the}} fastest marine reptiles. Their length/depth ratio was between three and five, the optimal number to minimise water resistance or drag. Their smooth skin and streamlined bodies prevented excessive turbulence. Their hydrodynamic efficiency, {{the degree to which}} energy is converted into a forward movement, would approach that of dolphins and measure about 0.8. Ichthyosaurs would be a fifth faster than plesiosaurs, though half of the difference was explained by assuming a 30% higher metabolism for ichthyosaurs. Together, within Massare's model these effects resulted in a cruising speed of slightly less than five <b>kilometres</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour.</b> However, in 2002, Motani corrected certain mistakes in Massare's formulae and revised the estimated cruising speed to less than two <b>kilometres</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour,</b> somewhat below that of modern Cetacea.

50|$|Government {{legislation}} {{has always had}} a major impact on the New Zealand industry.

A tariff did apply to cars and car parts brought into New Zealand, although with McLean's cars there was some initial confusion as to what rate might apply. In 1906 local coachmakers sought an increase in the tariff to 50% for completely built up vehicles and in 1907 a 20% tariff was introduced on cars that arrived in New Zealand already assembled to protect them but there remained no duty on chassis.|$|R
40|$|Local {{authorities}} {{such as the}} City of Tshwane (CoT) Municipality {{are confronted}} {{on a daily basis}} with road traffic safety challenges around schools. School principals, councillors, parents, scholars and neighbourhood residents approach local authorities for assistance to address unlawful driver behaviour and implement remedial measures to enhance the safety of scholars at schools. One potential countermeasure is the implementation of 30 km/h speed limit zones at schools. However, such speed limit zones to improve pedestrian safety on lower order roads around schools are not common in South Africa. Very little before-and-after data are available to understand and evaluate the effectiveness of such zones. The objective {{of this study was to}} measure the effectiveness of introducing a 30 km/h speed limit zone strategy at schools, where high pedestrian activity and non-motorised transport are present and can be endangered by vehicular traffic. Thirty <b>kilometre</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> speed limit school zone signs were designed and installed to enforce a 30 km/h speed limit for specific periods of time during school arrival and departure times. Three school sites in different areas in the City of Tshwane Municipality were selected as case study sites. Before-and-after speed data were used to test the hypothesis that the 30 km/h speed limit zone has no effect on the mean and variance of speed. The results showed that the speeds recorded after the implementation of the 30 km/h speed limit school zone signs varied between 30 km/h and 35 km/h at all the sites. The mean speed at all the sites was lower than before, for both passenger and public transport vehicles. A control site was also used to ensure that the results were not caused by spurious fluctuations. Qualitative feedback from the schools showed widespread acceptance of the measure. The results of this study show that international best practice initiatives can be applied with great success and that 30 km/h speed limit school zones can contribute to safer roads and support the National Road Safety Strategy to reduce the increasing trend in road traffic fatalities.

40|$|The {{possibility}} to integrate renewable energy supply with the electricity demand of inductively charged city buses is investigated in this paper. Rising CO 2 levels due to transport put {{a strain on}} the environment in urban areas. One method to attend to this problem is by electrifying city buses. City buses {{with an electric motor}} do not exhaust CO 2 and other greenhouse gases. To make the use of electrified buses sustainable though, the source of the electricity should be a clean source, without CO 2 or greenhouse gas emissions. However, the sources of clean renewable energy, solar PV and on- and offshore wind, are intermittent. Their variable production scheme can pose problems for charging and storage. For that reason, inductive charging is introduced. It is a new method to charge a vehicle contactless, by making use of electromagnetism. The aim of this research is to see whether supply and demand can be integrated, as to make sure there is minimal need of storage. Both daily renewable energy supply patterns from solar PV, on- and offshore wind and the electricity demand from city buses in four medium-sized cities is reviewed. To determine the renewable energy supply patterns, wind speeds and solar irradiation data are obtained from the database of the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute (KNMI). These input values are used for the current and the future production scenarios. To define the electricity demand from the buses, four medium-sized cities were chosen and their bus activity was analysed. The amount of <b>kilometres</b> driven <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> resulted in the activity for the entire city. Combined with the energy use <b>per</b> <b>kilometre,</b> the total hourly electricity demand was calculated. A smart grid can be utilized to supply the generated electricity at the place where it is necessary. This study finds that for all seasons, the average curves for supply and demand match. This means that inductive charging could be a solution to drive an electric motor, without needing a large storage capacity, to diminish CO 2 exhaust in urban areas...|$|R
