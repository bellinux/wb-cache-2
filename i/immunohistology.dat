He was president of the American Association of Immunologists (1960-1961) and a Councillor and President of the Histochemistry Society, and was given several other awards and international honorary academic degrees. These included the Paul Ehrlich Award in 1961, the Passano Award in 1962, the Gairdner Foundation Annual Award in 1963, the Emil von Behringer Prize in 1966, and honorary Sc.D. degrees from Williams College, Yale University, and Emory University.

40|$|Two {{monoclonal}} antibodies recognising epitopes {{associated with}} oestrogen receptor protein were evaluated against the assayable soluble oestrogen receptor concentration {{in a series}} of 149 breast carcinomas. One antibody (anti-ER) recognises the hormone binding unit of oestrogen receptor and gives nuclear staining; the other antibody (anti-D 5) was raised to a component of soluble oestrogen receptor and gives cytoplasmic staining. To minimise variations attributable to tumour heterogeneity and sampling error <b>immunohistology</b> using the two monoclonal antibodies, radioligand binding assays, enzyme immunoassays, and quantitative histology were done on adjacent frozen sections. Thirty nine per cent, 48 %, 54 %, and 43 % of the tumours were found to be oestrogen receptor positive by radioligand binding assay, anti-ER and anti-D 5 <b>immunohistology,</b> and enzyme immunoassay, respectively. Strong correlations (p less than 0. 0005) were found between anti-ER <b>immunohistology</b> and the radioligand binding assay. Only weak correlations were found between anti-D 5 <b>immunohistology</b> and the results of other assay methods for oestrogen receptor.

40|$|AIMS: To analyse the {{expression}} of p 53 in lymphatic cells found in inflammatory tissues and the peripheral blood by immunological methods. METHODS: Immunohistological analysis of synovial tissues from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes were performed with anti-p 53 antibodies from different sources. RESULTS: The anti-p 53 antibodies PAb 240, PAb 421, and PAb 1801 from one supplier bound to the cytoplasm of lymphocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells in rheumatoid synovial tissue, while the same anti-p 53 antibodies from other sources and the p 53 specific antibodies PAb 1620 and DO 1 were negative. Using flow cytometry, the antibodies that labelled cells in inflammatory tissues were shown to bind also to peripheral lymphocytes, while the antibodies that were negative in <b>immunohistology</b> did not react with peripheral blood lymphocytes. p 53 expression could be confirmed by western blot in rheumatoid synovial tissue, but not in peripheral blood lymphocytes using PAb 421 and PAb 240 antibodies from our own laboratory, which had been negative in <b>immunohistology.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Demonstration of p 53 by western blot is more sensitive and reliable than <b>immunohistology</b> and flow cytometry.

Routinely processed paraffin wax sections of 50 cases of breast carcinoma with known ER concentrations, estimated by the standard dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) biochemical assay, were examined using the avidin-biotin complex-immunoperoxidase technique.

Using monoclonal antibodies (UCHL 1, MB 2, MT 1, LN 1, LN 2, and L 26) that are effective in paraffin-embedded, B 5 -fixed tissue, 13 cases of DML were studied.

These stages are similar morphologically to basal cells, intermediate and superficial squamous cells seen in normal squamous epithelium.

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: Despite {{the fact}} that {{mechanical}} stresses are well recognized as key determinants for atherosclerotic plaque rupture, very {{little is known about}} stress amplitude and distribution in atherosclerotic lesions, even in the standard apolipoprotein E (apoE) -/- mouse model of atherosclerosis. Our objectives were to combine <b>immunohistology,</b> atomic force microscopy measurements, and finite element computational analysis for the accurate quantification of stress amplitude and distribution in apoE-/- mouse aortic atherosclerotic lesions. METHODS AND RESULTS: Residual stresses and strains were released by radially cutting aortic arch segments from 7 - to 30 -week-old pathological apoE-/- (n= 25) and healthy control mice (n= 20). <b>Immunohistology,</b> atomic force microscopy, and biomechanical modeling taking into account regional residual stresses and strains were performed. Maximum stress values were observed in the normal arterial wall (276 ± 71 kPa), whereas low values (< 20 kPa) were observed in all plaque areas. Stress distribution was not correlated to macrophage infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: Low mechanical stress amplitude was observed in apoE-/- mouse aortic atherosclerotic lesions.

METHODS: The tissue distribution of intravenously injected staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA), enterotoxin B (SEB), enterotoxin C (SEC), enterotoxin D (SED), toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST- 1), and alpha-haemolysin was studied in rats using <b>immunohistology</b> and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with immunoblotting.
