5|$|I wish {{to state}} that my book, Vier Jahre unter Kannibalen, {{contains}} a number of misrepresentations regarding my journeys <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guinea.</b> The book in question is a scientific report in part only; it is primarily a fictional account of my experiences <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> and owes its origin to the unusual circumstances prevailing in Germany {{at the time of}} my return. Some of the journeys I had actually undertaken are not described at all; on the other hand it contains passages that do not correspond with the facts.|$|E

5|$|In mid-November, Allied forces {{attacked}} the Japanese at Buna-Gona <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guinea.</b> Japanese Combined Fleet naval leaders, headquartered at Truk {{and under the}} overall command of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, felt Allied advances <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> posed a greater threat {{to the security of}} the Japanese Empire than an Allied military presence in the southern Solomons. Therefore, Combined Fleet naval staff officers began to prepare plans for abandoning Guadalcanal and shifting priorities and resources to operations around New Guinea. At this time, the navy did not inform the army of their intentions in this regard.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} be able to move troops to the front <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> more rapidly, to acclimatise them during the process, and to allow more {{realistic}} training of large formations in jungle and mountainous but malaria-free terrain, Blamey decided to establish a training and staging area on the Atherton Tableland in November 1942. Eventually, accommodation was provided there for 70,000 troops. As divisions returned from tours of duty <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> in 1943 and 1944, they were sent to Atherton for anti-malaria treatment. The men then went on leave, after which they returned to Atherton where training was conducted before staging and departing again.|$|E

It conducted operations <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guinea,</b> New Britain, and Bougainville {{until the end of the}} war. Re-designated Northern Area in December 1945, it was headquartered in Port Moresby from March 1946 and disbanded in February 1947.|$|E

5|$|In February 1943, {{concurrent}} with No.1 Wing and {{its three}} Supermarine Spitfire squadrons becoming operational in the Darwin area, No.77 Squadron {{was transferred to}} Milne Bay <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guinea.</b> Along with Nos.6, 75 and 100 Squadrons it came {{under the control of}} the newly formed No.71 Wing, which was part of No.9 Operational Group, the RAAF's main mobile formation in the South West Pacific Area. No.77 Squadron registered its first daytime victory on 11April, when a Kittyhawk shot down a Mitsubishi Zero taking part in a raid on Allied shipping near Buna. Three days later the Japanese attacked Milne Bay; the squadron claimed four bombers and a fighter for the loss of one Kittyhawk. By this time, Allied headquarters had finalised plans for a drive north to the Philippines involving heavy attacks on Rabaul and the occupation of territory <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guinea,</b> New Britain and the Solomon Islands.|$|E
5|$|In February and March 1942 the Allied {{position}} <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> {{was under}} pressure and Japanese aircraft had been sighted over the Torres Strait Islands and Cape York in northern Australia. As a result, priority {{was given to}} basing a fighter squadron at Port Moresby <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> to defend the town's important airfields and port facilities. The RAAF received an allocation of 25 P-40Kittyhawk fighters in late February that were flown to Townsville, Queensland, and used to form No.75 Squadron on 4March 1942. The need to reinforce Port Moresby's defences was so pressing that the squadron was allowed only nine days to train with the aircraft before it deployed. Commanded initially by Squadron Leader Peter Jeffrey, No.75 Squadron's advance party arrived in Port Moresby on 17March and its aircraft followed between the 19th (when Squadron Leader John Jackson assumed command) and 21st of the month. At this time only four of the squadron's 21 pilots, including its commander, had previously seen combat.|$|E

In May 1942, the battalion's commanding officer, Conran, was deemed medically unfit for service and on 24 May he relinquished command. In June 1942, as the military situation <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> deteriorated further, the battalion received orders {{to move up the}} Kokoda Track in order to act as a blocking force against the possibility of a Japanese advance overland from the north. In order to counter this threat, Maroubra Force composed of troops the 39th Battalion and the Papuan Infantry Battalion (PIB) were sent to Kokoda, arriving there on 15 July. This move proved prescient as a large Japanese force landed at Gona only a week later, and they quickly began to move inland towards Kokoda.|$|E

Kenney wrote out orders, which were sent by courier, for Brigadier General Ennis Whitehead, the deputy commander of the Fifth Air Force, and the commander of its Advance Echelon (ADVON) <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guinea.</b> Under the Fifth Air Force’s unusual command arrangements, Whitehead controlled the Allied Air Forces units of all types <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guinea.</b> This included the RAAF units there, which were grouped as No. 9 Operational Group RAAF, under the command of Air Commodore Joe Hewitt.|$|E
