5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Mk.

Squadron use began in October, and its first victory came soon after on 19/20 November when a Beaufighter IF of No. 604 Squadron destroyed a Ju 88A-5 near Chichester, very close to the first success of the Mk. III.|$|E
5|$|The {{lessons learned}} during the South African War of 1899-1902 had {{reinforced}} {{the idea that}} the regular Army was not capable of fighting a prolonged full-scale war without significant assistance; almost all regular units in the United Kingdom had been deployed overseas within four months of the outbreak of hostilities, and the entire pool of reserve manpower had been exhausted in under a year. There had been no thought before the war to using auxiliary forces overseas; in the event, volunteers had been used on an ad-hoc basis, and a new auxiliary arm (the Imperial Yeomanry) was formed to provide specialist troops, but it was clear that a more <b>effective</b> <b>system</b> was required in future. A number of attempts at reform under the Conservative government of 1901-1905 had failed to make any lasting changes to the system, and left the auxiliary forces disorganised and demoralised.|$|E

5|$|The many {{achievements}} of the ancient Egyptians include the quarrying, surveying and construction techniques that supported the building of monumental pyramids, temples, and obelisks; a system of mathematics, a practical and <b>effective</b> <b>system</b> of medicine, irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques, the first known planked boats, Egyptian faience and glass technology, new forms of literature, and the earliest known peace treaty, made with the Hittites. Egypt left a lasting legacy. Its art and architecture were widely copied, and its antiquities carried off to far corners of the world. Its monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of travelers and writers for centuries. A new-found respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period by Europeans and Egyptians led to the scientific investigation of Egyptian civilization and a greater appreciation of its cultural legacy.|$|E

25|$|Refugees {{are often}} more {{susceptible}} to illness for several reasons, including a lack of immunity to local strains of malaria and other diseases. Displacement of a people can create favorable conditions for disease transmission. Refugee camps are typically heavily populated with poor sanitary conditions. The removal of vegetation for space, building materials or firewood also deprives mosquitoes of their natural habitats, leading them to more closely interact with humans. In the 1970s, Afghani refugees that were relocated to Pakistan were going from {{a country with a}}n effective malaria control strategy, to a country with a less <b>effective</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

The 30 were committed to prison, while Key was made Deputy Mayor {{to act in the}} absence of the Mayor (Sam March) who was to go to jail. He was a key organiser of the successful campaign to get the councillors released, and subsequently wrote pamphlets telling the history of the campaign. The rates strike secured a more <b>effective</b> <b>system</b> of easing the burden of LCC rates on poorer boroughs and making borough rates produce the same revenue for councils.|$|E
25|$|A {{recoilless}} rifle (RCLR) or recoilless gun is a lightweight weapon that fires a heavier projectile {{that would be}} impractical to fire from a recoiling weapon of comparable size. Technically, only devices that use a rifled barrel are {{recoilless rifle}}s. Smoothbore variants are recoilless guns. This distinction is often lost, and both are often called recoilless rifles. The key difference from rocket launchers (whether man-portable or not) is that the projectile of the recoilless rifle has no propulsion of its own - once out of the rifle, it does not accelerate further, like a missile or rocket would. Normally used for anti-tank roles, the first <b>effective</b> <b>system</b> of this kind was developed during World War II by William Kroeger and Clarence Musser.|$|E
25|$|Qualitative data {{analysis}} contains reviewing, summarizing, generalizing and interpreting data {{in an appropriate}} and accurate way. It is to describe and explain the phenomena or social worlds being studied. One {{of the most important}} steps in the qualitative research process is analysis of data. Analyzing qualitative data also requires researchers’ patience. There are two different analytical procedures: Meaning and discovery-Focused approaches. Meaning-focused approaches emphasize meaning comprehension. In other words, try to understand the subjective meaning of experiences for the participants, instead of placing those meanings into researchers’ own conceptions. Discovery-focused techniques aim to establish patterns and connections among elements of data. However, no matter which procedure is used, it is essential to apply an <b>effective</b> <b>system</b> for retrieving data because of the identity of qualitative {{data analysis}}, which is exploring data progressively.|$|E

The SEI is also the home of CERT/CC, the federally funded computer security organization.

25|$|A {{public inquiry}} into the crash by Lord Cullen was held in 2000. Since both the Paddington and Southall crashes had reopened public debate on ATP, a {{separate}} joint inquiry considering {{the issue in the}} light of both crashes was also held in 2000; it confirmed the rejection of ATP and the mandatory adoption of a cheaper and less <b>effective</b> <b>system,</b> but noted a mismatch between public opinion and cost-benefit analysis. The Cullen inquiry was carried out in two blocks of sittings, sandwiching the 'joint inquiry'; the first block dealt with the accident itself, the second block dealt with the management and regulation of UK railway safety; this had always been part of the inquiry terms of reference, but was given additional urgency by a further train crash at Hatfield in October 2000. Major changes in the formal responsibilities for management and regulation of safety of UK rail transport ensued.|$|E
25|$|By 1969, the North Vietnamese {{had also}} worked out their {{doctrine}} and techniques {{for dealing with}} the recon teams. Originally, the PAVN had been caught unprepared and had been forced to respond in whatever haphazard manner local commanders could organize. Soon, however, an early warning system was created by placing radio-equipped air watch units within the flight paths between the launch sites and Base Areas. Within the Base Areas, lookouts were placed in trees and platforms to watch likely landing zones while the roads and trails were routinely swept by security forces. The PAVN also began to organize and develop specialized units that would both drive and then fix the teams so that they could be destroyed. By 1970, they had created a layered and <b>effective</b> <b>system,</b> and SOG recon teams found their time on the ground both shortened and more dangerous. The mauling or wiping out of entire teams began to become a less uncommon occurrence.|$|E

25|$|On {{the basis}} of the Renormalization Group Theory of the instanton vacuum one can form a general flow diagram where the topological sectors are {{represented}} by attractive fixed points. When scaling the <b>effective</b> <b>system</b> to larger sizes, the system generally flows to a stable phase at one of these points and as we can see in the flow diagram on the right, the longitudinal conductivity will vanish and the Hall conductivity takes on a quantized value. If we started with a Hall conductivity that is halfway between two attractive points, we would end up on the phase transition between topological sectors. As long as the symmetry isn't broken, the longitudinal conductivity doesn't vanish and is even able to increase when scaling to a larger system size. In the flow diagram, we see fixed points that are repulsive {{in the direction of the}} Hall current and attractive in the direction of the longitudinal current. It is most interesting to approach these fixed saddle points as close as possible and measure the (universal) behavior of the quantum Hall transitions.|$|E
