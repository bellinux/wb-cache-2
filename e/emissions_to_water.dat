Agri-environmental policy and land management practices have, in many areas, reduced nutrient <b>emissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>water.</b> However, additional measures may be required in Ireland to further decouple the relationship between agricultural productivity and <b>emissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>water,</b> which is of vital importance given on-going agricultural intensification. The Source Load Apportionment Model (SLAM) framework characterises sources of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) <b>emissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> at a range of scales from sub-catchment to national. The SLAM synthesises land use and physical characteristics to predict emissions from point (wastewater, industry discharges and septic tank systems) and diffuse sources (agriculture, forestry, etc.). The predicted annual nutrient emissions were assessed against monitoring data for 16 major river catchments covering 50 % of the area of Ireland. At national scale, results indicate that total average annual emissions to surface water in Ireland are over 2700 t yr- 1 of P and 82, 000 t yr- 1 of N. The proportional contributions from individual sources show that the main sources of P are from municipal wastewater treatment plants and agriculture, with wide variations across the country related to local anthropogenic pressures and the hydrogeological setting.

This study determines how {{and to which}} extent the management of phosphorus in Austria can be optimized. A detailed national model, obtained for the year 2013 through Material Flow Analysis, represents the reference situation. Applicability and limitations are discussed {{for a range of}} actions aimed at reducing consumption, increasing recycling, and lowering emissions. The potential contribution of each field of action is quantified and compared using three indicators: Import dependency, Consumption of fossil-P fertilizers and <b>Emissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> bodies. Further, the uncertainty of this assessment is characterized and priorities for the upgrade of data collection are identified. Moreover, all the potential gains discussed in the article are applied to the reference situation to generate an ideal target model. The results show that in Austria a large scope for phosphorus stewardship exists. Strategies based exclusively either on recycling or on the decline of P consumption hold a similar potential to reduce import dependency by 50 % each. An enhanced P recycling from meat and bone meal, sewage sludge and compost could replace the current use of fossil-P fertilizers by 70 %. The target model, i. e. the maximum that could be achieved taking into account trade-offs between different actions, is characterized by an extremely low import dependency of 0. 23 kgPcap− 1 y− 1 (2. 2 kgPcap− 1 y− 1 in 2013), by a 28 % decline of <b>emissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> bodies and by null consumption of fossil-P fertilizers.

Important measures {{to achieve this goal}} include reducing emissions of nitrogen (N) and phosphate (P 2 O 5) from manure and mineral fertilizers into the environment. In regions with a high livestock density, this measure is expected to affect agricultural production and income. To quantify these effects, an environmental economic model is required that can assess alternatives capable of reducing N and P 2 O 5 potential <b>emissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>water.</b> In this paper, we develop a model that is capable of analysing changes in potential <b>emissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> of N and P 2 O 5 and apply it to the Netherlands, a country with large nutrient emissions. Compared to a 2015 reference scenario based on current efforts to reduce nutrient emissions, we found that the WFD measures will increase regional transport and export of manure and reduce the number of animals in the Netherlands. Fodder adjustments (defined as lower N and P 2 O 5 input in purchased fodder) to decrease nutrient excretion in manure were a less attractive option than amongst others export, transportation of manure to another region, land use changes or reduction of the number of livestock. Compared to the reference scenario in 2015, total agricultural income will decrease by about € 81. 5 million per year (about € 49 /ha per year), although the effects will differ among parts of the Netherlands and agricultural sectors. The average predicted decrease in N emissions from agricultural sites, vulnerable to leaching into bodies of water will be almost 20 % or approximately 14. 7 kg N/ha per year.

Reductions were estimated to be 79 % (aim: at least 75 %) for <b>emissions</b> <b>to</b> soil and groundwater, 54 % (aim: at least 50 %) for <b>emissions</b> <b>to</b> air and 79 % (aim: at least 90 %) for <b>emissions</b> <b>to</b> surface <b>water.</b> The <b>emissions</b> <b>to</b> air constitute over 95 % of total emitted amounts. This report presents technical backgrounds, boundary conditions and calculation methods. As compared to the interim evaluation in 1995, several calculations methods have changed significantly. For the calculation of <b>emissions</b> <b>to</b> air, new information has become available {{so that it is}} now possible to account for direct <b>emission</b> of droplets <b>to</b> air and interactions of the plant protection products with soil and crop. The leaching and drainage is calculated directly for the most important substances, while in the interim evaluation an overall distribution was calculated. Drift <b>to</b> surface <b>water</b> and non-target areas is now based on an extended database on drift measurements and includes drift reduction measures. Emissions for the reference period and for 1995 have been recalculated with the new calculation procedures to make a proper evaluation of the reduction percentages possible...|$|R
40|$|The vocal {{repertoire}} of the Amazon river dolphin and its geographic variations are still poorly known, especially {{in relation to}} ecological variables. Here the acoustic characteristics of low frequency pulsed vocalizations, with single or multiple pulses, recorded in two protected areas of the Amazon were described and differences in acoustic <b>emissions</b> related <b>to</b> <b>water</b> properties were analyzed. Both frequency and time parameters differ relative to abiotic condition of water turbidity. Changes in the animals’ acoustic behavior {{might be due to}} differences in sound propagation between rich-sediment water and clear water. Geographic variation was found in frequency and time parameters, requiring further investigation. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT...|$|R
