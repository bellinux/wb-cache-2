40|$|The {{distributional}} form {{of financial}} asset returns {{has important implications}} for the theoretical and empirical analyses in economics and finance. It is now a well-established fact that <b>financial</b> return <b>distributions</b> are empirically nonstationary, both in the weak and the strong sense. One first step to model such nonstationarity is to assume that these return distributions retain their shape, but not their localization (mean) or size (volatility) as the classical Gaussian distributions do. In that case, one needs also to pay attention to skewedness and kurtosis, in addition to localization and size. This modeling requires special Zolotarev parametrizations of <b>financial</b> <b>distributions,</b> with a four parameters, one for each relevant distributional moment. Recently popular stable <b>financial</b> <b>distributions</b> are the Paretian scaling distributions, which scale both in time T and frequency. For example, the volatility of the lognormal <b>financial</b> price <b>distribution,</b> derived from the geometric Brownian asset return motion and used to model Black-Scholes (1973) option pricing, scales according to T^{ 0. 5 }. More generally, the volatility of the price return distributions of Calvet and Fisher's (2002) Multifractal Model for Asset Returns (MMAR) scales according to T^{(1 /(_{Z})) }, where the Zolotarev stability exponent _{Z} measures the degree of the scaling, and thus of the nonstationarity of the financial returns.
