40|$|Today Network and Service Providers {{are aware}} of the {{increasing}} data traffic volumes and as such they are strategically moving investigations toward a single integrated voice and data infrastructure.

Nevetheless incumbent NSPs that build a multi-service IP network are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>need</b> connectivity <b>to</b> its preexisting legacy networks (e. g. ATM. SONET, SDH).
