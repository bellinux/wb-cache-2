5|$|Golden jackals are {{extremely}} harmful to fur-bearing rodents, such as coypu and muskrats. Coypu can be completely extirpated {{in shallow water}} bodies. During 1948–1949 in the Amu Darya, muskrats constituted 12.3% of jackal faecal contents, and 71% of muskrat houses were destroyed by jackals. Jackals also <b>harm</b> <b>the</b> fur industry by eating muskrats caught in traps or taking skins left out to dry.|$|E
5|$|In 1662, the Kangxi Emperor moved all {{residents}} along southern China coastline inland by 50 Chinese miles and abandoned the salt-fields {{in hopes of}} weakening the pirate Zheng Chenggong's power through cutting his support from coastline residents. Although the residents were allowed to return in 1669, after the Kangxi Emperor discovered that the migration brought great economic <b>harm,</b> <b>the</b> salt industry in Ham Tin never prospered again.|$|E

5|$|Manning's lawyers {{argued that}} the {{government}} had overstated the <b>harm</b> <b>the</b> release of the documents had caused, and had overcharged Manning to force her to give evidence against Assange. The defense also raised questions about whether Manning's confusion over her gender identity affected her behavior and decision making.|$|E
5|$|More subtle Jewish {{references}} are {{also included in}} {{other aspects of the}} Rugrats franchise. In The Rugrats Movie, the 1998 film based on the series, Tommy is prepared to pour banana baby food on his infant brother Dil, which would attract a group of vicious monkeys who would likely <b>harm</b> <b>the</b> young baby; the scene parallels the Sacrifice of Isaac, a primal covenant in Jewish studies.|$|E

He, Maggie, and Jimmy (James Allen McCune) bring Rick to a forest swamp where two walkers are stuck. Hershel insists that if Rick's group is to stay on his farm, they must treat the walkers as people, and shows Rick how to snare and lead the walkers back.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 14th century, {{the castle}} was used as a refuge by Richard II from the forces of his rival, Henry Bolingbroke. On 12August 1399, after {{returning}} from Ireland, Richard {{made his way to the}} castle where he met Bolingbroke's emissary, Henry Percy, for negotiations. Percy swore in the chapel he would not <b>harm</b> <b>the</b> king. On 19 August, Richard surrendered to Percy at Flint Castle, promising to abdicate if his life were spared. The king was then taken to London and died later in captivity at Pontefract Castle.|$|E
5|$|Control over {{propaganda}} {{is another}} matter. When forming his argument here, Russell specifically targets the doctrines of John Stuart Mill. Russell argues that Mill's {{argument for the}} freedom of speech is too weak, so long as it is balanced against the harm principle; for any speech worth protecting for political reasons is likely to cause somebody harm. For example, the citizen ought {{to have the opportunity to}} impeach malicious governors, but that would surely <b>harm</b> <b>the</b> governor, at the very least (Russell 1938:179).|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Bevin faced state Attorney General Jack Conway, marking the first gubernatorial race {{in state history}} {{featuring}} two candidates from Louisville, the state's largest city. The Kentucky Democratic Party attempted to play up the fractures in the Republican Party over Bevin's candidacy, launching a web site featuring fellow Republicans' criticisms of Bevin, drawn mostly from his primary race against McConnell. Bevin responded with a web site tying Conway to President Barack Obama, who was very unpopular in Kentucky, saying that Conway would support environmental regulations that <b>harm</b> <b>the</b> coal industry and support the Affordable Care Act, which was also unpopular in the state, despite its nationally praised insurance exchange.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many other}} organisms, {{increasing}} ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion {{and other factors}} may <b>harm</b> <b>the</b> DNA of amphibians, particularly their eggs. The amount of damage depends upon the life stage, the species type and other environmental parameters. Salamanders and frogs that produce less photolyase, an enzyme that counteracts DNA damage from UVB, {{are more susceptible to}} the effects of loss of the ozone layer. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation may not kill a particular species or life stage but may cause sublethal damage.|$|E
5|$|PC Magazine {{found that}} the {{firewall}} put all ports in stealth mode. The firewall blocked ten of 12 leak tests, used to see if malware can evade the firewall's control of network traffic. Previous versions did not identify the tests because none carried a malicious payload. Another test was conducted using Core Impact, which successfully exploited one vulnerability on the test computer. However, other components of Norton stopped the exploit from causing <b>harm.</b> <b>The</b> other attempts were unsuccessful either because the system was invulnerable or Norton's Intrusion Prevention System stopped it. Attempts to disable the firewall were unsuccessful by PC Magazine. On the contrary, PC Pro identified 15 open ports on a computer with Norton installed.|$|E

5|$|The {{antelope}} is {{native to}} and found mainly in India, while it is extinct in Bangladesh. Formerly widespread, only small, scattered herds are seen today, largely confined to protected areas. During the 20th century, blackbuck numbers declined sharply due to excessive hunting, deforestation and habitat degradation. The blackbuck has been introduced in Argentina and the United States. In India, hunting of blackbuck is prohibited under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. The blackbuck has significance in Hinduism; Indian and Nepali villagers do not <b>harm</b> <b>the</b> antelope.|$|E
5|$|The {{blackbuck}} has {{associations with}} the Indian culture. The antelope {{might have been}} a source of food in the Indus Valley civilisation (33001700 BCE); bone remains have been discovered in sites such as Dholavira and Mehrgarh. The blackbuck is routinely depicted in miniature paintings of the Mughal era (16th to 19th centuries) depicting royal hunts often using cheetahs. Villagers in India and Nepal generally do not <b>harm</b> <b>the</b> blackbuck. Tribes such as the Bishnois revere and care for most animals including the blackbuck. The blackbuck has been declared as the state animal of Andhra Pradesh.|$|E
5|$|After Picard is {{returned}} to the schoolroom, the lead Ferengi threatens to <b>harm</b> <b>the</b> children if Riker does not unlock the computer and teach his lieutenant how to operate the Enterprise. Riker pretends to instruct the Ferengi officer, but only spouts deliberately meaningless technobabble as he unlocks the computer console in Picard's schoolroom. With command functions enabled, Picard is able to activate a transporter safety function. With help from Worf's son, Alexander Rozhenko (Brian Bonsall), Guinan, and Ro, they use communication badges to trap most of the Ferengi on a transporter pad with their weapons disarmed and the exit blocked by a force field. Once {{most of them are}} detained, the children and Riker are able to overpower the remaining members and retake the Enterprise. After the events, the transporter is used to return Picard, Guinan, and Keiko to their adult states. Ro, buoyed by her experience, decides to remain a child for just a little while longer and draw some pictures, something she never did during her childhood.|$|E
