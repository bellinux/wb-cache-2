In 2003, he led the brigade into the start of Iraq War, supported by units from the British Army {{as well as the}} United States Marine Corps, making Dutton the first British officer to command American troops since the Second World War. He commanded his men through heavy resistance <b>from</b> <b>Iraqi</b> forces {{in the early days of}} the war.|$|E

In October, twin bombings killed 26 people and wounded 65 at a reconciliation meeting in Ramadi. In December, a coordinated double suicide bombing outside Ramadi's government compound killed 25 people and severely wounded Governor Qasim Al-Fahdawi, who lost an arm.|$|E

5|$|Assuming {{command of}} United States Central Command in 1988, Schwarzkopf was {{called on to}} respond to the Invasion of Kuwait in 1990 by the forces of Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Initially tasked with {{defending}} Saudi Arabia <b>from</b> <b>Iraqi</b> aggression, Schwarzkopf's command eventually grew to an international force of over 750,000 troops. After diplomatic relations broke down, he planned and led Operation Desert Storm—an extended air campaign followed by a highly successful 100-hour ground offensive—which defeated the Iraqi Army and liberated Kuwait in early 1991. Schwarzkopf was presented with military honors.|$|E
5|$|On 7 April 1991, Iraq {{accepted}} United Nations (UN) cease-fire {{conditions and}} resolutions, thereby officially ending the Gulf War. This same day, a large multinational, multiple-agency humanitarian effort {{under the authority}} of UN Security Council Resolution No. 688 began to aid the approximately 500,000 Kurdish refugees who had fled <b>from</b> <b>Iraqi</b> military forces into the hills of northern Iraq. On 18 April 1991, John Shalikashvili took command of the U.S.-led operation to ensure security for UN relief operations and the Kurdish refugees, called Operation Provide Comfort (OPC).|$|E
5|$|Between 1964 and 1975, both Britain and France {{delivered}} significant {{quantities of}} arms, including Hunters, to Iraq. The Hunters {{were far more}} effective in fighting guerrilla activity than the Russian MiG-17s then operated by Iraq. In 1967, Hunters of the Iraqi Air Force saw action after the Six-Day War between Israel and several neighbouring Arab nations. During the War of Attrition Iraqi Hunters usually operated from bases in Egypt and Syria. While flying a Hunter <b>from</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Airbase H3, Flight Lieutenant Saiful Azam, on exchange from the Pakistan Air Force, shot down three Israeli jets including a Sud Aviation Vautour and a Mirage IIICJ. Some missions were also flown by the Royal Jordanian Air Force, {{but most of the}} Jordanian Hunters were destroyed on the ground {{on the first day of}} the Six-Day War. Replacement Hunters for Jordanian service were acquired from both Britain and Saudi Arabia in the war's aftermath. These were used with considerable success in ground attacks against Syrian Army tanks during the Black September Crisis.|$|E

5|$|The New York Times {{supported}} the 2003 invasion of Iraq. On May 26, 2004, {{a year after}} the war started, the newspaper asserted that some of its articles had not been as rigorous as they should have been, and were insufficiently qualified, frequently overly dependent upon information <b>from</b> <b>Iraqi</b> exiles desiring regime change. Reporter Judith Miller retired after criticisms that her reporting of the lead-up to the Iraq War was factually inaccurate and overly favorable to the Bush administration's position, for which The New York Times later apologized. One of Miller's prime sources was Ahmed Chalabi, an Iraqi expatriate who returned to Iraq after the U.S. invasion and held a number of governmental positions culminating in acting oil minister and deputy prime minister from May 2005 until May 2006.|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{following}} Iraq’s {{invasion of}} Kuwait, predictions {{were made of}} an environmental disaster stemming <b>from</b> <b>Iraqi</b> threats to blow up captured Kuwaiti oil wells.

25|$|On November 4, 1990, the 4th Battalion, 27th Field Artillery was {{deployed}} to defend Saudi Arabia <b>from</b> <b>Iraqi</b> invasion {{as part of}} Operation Desert Shield in late December 1990.

During the ensuing 96 hours of Operation Desert Storm, the battalion unleashed major bombardments with their 27 M270 MLRS launchers against Iraqi forces.|$|E
25|$|After a rapid initial advance, {{the first}} major pause {{occurred}} near Karbala. There, U.S. Army elements met resistance <b>from</b> <b>Iraqi</b> troops defending cities and key bridges along the Euphrates River. These forces threatened to interdict supply routes as American forces moved north. Eventually, troops from the 101st Airborne Division of the U.S Army secured the cities of Najaf and Karbala to prevent any Iraqi counterattacks on the 3rd Infantry Division's lines of communication as the division pressed its advance toward Baghdad.|$|E
