In 1974, domestic aid during <b>in-patient</b> or <b>in-patient</b> cures was established, sick pay to compensate for wages lost while caring for a child was introduced, and the time-limit to <b>in-patient</b> care was removed. That same year, the cover of rehabilitation services was increased, together with the cover of dental and orthodontic services. Health insurance coverage was extended to self-employed agricultural workers in 1972, and to students and the disabled in 1975. in 1971, an International Transactions Tax Law was passed.|$|E

40|$|Background: Reproductive tract {{infections are}} public health {{problems}} in women of reproductive age and {{can result in}} serious consequences if not treated. Aims: To determine the prevalence and causes of reproductive tract infections among <b>in-patients</b> and out-patients attending a tertiary health institution in Benin City. The antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of bacterial agents will also be determined. Patients and Methods: High vaginal swabs or endocervical swabs and blood were collected from 957 patients consisting of 755 out-patients and 202 <b>in-patients.</b> The swabs were processed and microbial isolates identified using standard technique. Disc susceptibility tests were also performed on microbial isolates. The blood samples were used for serological diagnosis of syphilis. Results: There {{was no significant difference}} in the prevalence of female reproductive tract infections between <b>in-patients</b> (52. 48 %) and out-patients (47. 02 %), although <b>in-patients</b> showed a significantly higher risk of developing mixed infections (<b>in-patients</b> vs. out-patients; 34. 91 % vs. 22. 25 %, OR = 1. 873 95 % CI = 1. 169, 3. 001; P = 0. 01). Candida albicans was the most prevalent etiologic agent among out-patients studied while Staphylococcus aureus was the most prevalent etiologic agent among <b>in-patients.</b> Trichomonas vaginalis was observed only among out-patients. Ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were the most active antibacterial agents. Syphilis was not detected in any patient. Conclusion: An overall prevalence of 48. 17 % of female reproductive tract infection was observed among the study population. Although there was no significant difference between <b>in-patients</b> and out-patients, <b>in-patients</b> appeared to have 1 - 3 -fold increase risk of developing mixed infections. The most prevalent etiologic agent differs between <b>in-patients</b> and out-patients. Despite the high activity of ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against bacterial isolates from both <b>in-patients</b> and out-patients, prudent use of antibacterial agents is advocated...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{number of}} {{challenge}} {{studies have reported}} abnormalities of serotonergic function in borderline personality disorder (BPD). There are, however, problems with the pharmacological probes used in these studies since fenfluramine and m-CPP are not only serotonergic agents but also induce release of catecholamines, particularly dopamine. Therefore, we tested whether subjects with BPD showed a blunted prolactin (PRL) response to flesinoxan, a highly potent and selective 5 -HT 1 A agonist. METHODS: Flesinoxan challenge test {{was carried out in}} 20 BPD <b>in-patients</b> and 20 healthy controls matched for gender but not for age. Since 16 BPD <b>in-patients</b> exhibited major depressive co-morbidity, a group of 20 depressed <b>in-patients</b> matched for gender but not for age was also included. RESULTS: BPD <b>in-patients</b> exhibited blunted PRL responses as compared to controls, whereas depressed <b>in-patients</b> did not differ from controls. Moreover, PRL responses were lower among BPD <b>in-patients</b> than among depressed <b>in-patients.</b> Among the BPD <b>in-patients,</b> PRL responses to flesinoxan were lower in patients with past history of suicide attempts (N = 8) than in those with a negative history. CONCLUSIONS: The results show major involvement of serotonergic function in BPD and are consistent with previous studies linking lower serotonergic activity with impulsivity. More particularly, our data suggest that BPD is characterized by lower 5 -HT 1 A receptor sensitivity. Moreover, the data support the involvement of 5 -HT 1 A activity in suicidal behaviour. However, this conclusion is limited because other hormonal responses such as ACTH and cortisol were not assessed, and because BPD was assessed by a self-report questionnaire and not a structured clinical interview.

40|$|The present paper {{reports the}} {{isolation}} and characterization of drug resistant E. coli from the urine {{from the hospital}} out-patients and <b>in-patients</b> from 1976 to 1978 December. E. coli strains isolated from urine speciemens during the above period were examinated for sensitivity against 12 drugs such as aminobenzilpenicillin, carbenicillin, minocycline, colistin, nalidixic acid, cephalothin, cephazolin, kanamycin, gentamicin, dibekacin, tobramycin and polymixin. From the urine of out-patients women with acute cystitis, 515 strains of pathogens were isolated during that period, and 388 strains (75. 3 %) of them were E. coli. From the urine of <b>in-patients,</b> 193 (8. 9 %) out of 2714 strains isolated from the urine were E. coli. The sensitivity pattern of the above drugs against E. coli from the urine of out-patients showed better sensitivity than that from <b>in-patients.</b> The difference of sensitivity for each drug was smaller in out-patients (from CB-PC 68. 8 to GM 100 %) than in <b>in-patients</b> (from AB-PC 21. 1 to GM 98. 4 %).

25|$|In Canada, an NP is a {{registered}} nurse with a graduate degree in nursing. Canada recognizes them in the following specialties: primary healthcare NPs (PHCNP) and acute care NPs (ACNP).

PHCNPs work in places like community healthcare centers, primary healthcare settings and long term care institutions. The main focus of PHCNPs includes health promotion, preventative care, treatment and diagnosis of acute illnesses and injuries, and overseeing and managing chronic diseases. ANCNPs are specialized NPs who serve a specific population of patients. They administer care to individuals who are acutely, critically or chronically ill patients.
