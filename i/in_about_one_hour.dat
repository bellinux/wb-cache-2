40|$|Abstract. This paper {{analyzes}} {{the performance of}} UNION 3, a fast algorithm for computing the volume, area, and other mass properties, of the union of many polyhedra. These values are computed exactly, up to floating roundoff, without statistical sampling. If the input objects are independently, identically, and uniformly distributed, then the expected output time is linear {{in the size of}} the input. UNION 3 processes all the polyhedra in one pass instead of repeatedly combining them pair by pair. The first step finds the candidate output vertices. These are the 3 -face intersections, edge-face intersections, and input vertices. Next, the candidates are culled by deleting those inside any polyhedron. The volume is the sum of a function of each survivor. The principal data structure is a grid of uniform cells in E 3. Each cell records incidences (overlaps) of itself with any edge, face, or polyhedron. Intersection tests are performed only between objects incident on the same cell. Also, if a cell is completely contained in some polyhedron, then no intersection tests are performed in it, since none of those intersections would be visible. UNION 3 is well suited for parallel machines. A prototype implementation for identical random cubes has processed 20, 000, 000 polyhedra, containing half a billion subfacets, on a dual processor Pentium Xeon workstation <b>in</b> <b>about</b> <b>one</b> elapsed <b>hour.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|Finding vacua for {{the four}} {{dimensional}} effective theories for supergravity which descend from flux compactifications and analyzing them according to their stability {{is one of the}} central problems in string phenomenology. Except for some simple toy models, it is, however, difficult to find all the vacua analytically. Recently developed algorithmic methods based on symbolic computer algebra can be of great help in the more realistic models. However, they suffer from serious algorithmic complexities and are limited to small system sizes. In this article, we review a numerical method called the numerical polynomial homotopy continuation (NPHC) method, first used in the areas of lattice field theories, which by construction finds all of the vacua of a given potential that is known to have only isolated solutions. The NPHC method is known to suffer from no major algorithmic complexities and is embarrassingly parallelizable, and hence its applicability goes way beyond the existing symbolic methods. We first solve a simple toy model as a warm up example to demonstrate the NPHC method at work and compare the results with the available results from the symbolic methods. We then show that all the vacua of a more complicated model of M theory compactified on the coset SU(3) × U(1) /U(1) × U(1), which has an SU(3) structure, can be obtained by the NPHC method using a desktop machine <b>in</b> just <b>about</b> <b>one</b> <b>hour,</b> a feat which was reported to be prohibitively difficult by the existing symbolic methods.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} and implementation, UNION 3, for computing mass {{properties of the}} union of many identical axis-aligned cubes. This implementation has processed 20, 000, 000 cubes on a dual processor Pentium Xeon workstation <b>in</b> <b>about</b> <b>one</b> elapsed <b>hour.</b> The ideas would extend to the union of general polyhedra. UNION 3 works by combining three techniques. The first {{is a set of}} local topological formulae for computing polyhedral mass properties. No global topology is used, such as complete face or edge information, or edge loops and face shells. For example, the volume of a multiple component, concave, rectilinear object is P sixiyizi, summed over the vertices (xi, yi, zi), where each si {{is a function of the}} directions of the incident edges. The second technique is a 3 -D grid of uniform cells, which is overlaid on the data. Each cell has a list of edges, faces, and cubes that overlap it. Only pairs of objects in the same cell are tested for intersection. Experimentally, the uniform grid is quite tolerant of varying densities in the input. The third technique, building on the second, is the covered-cell concept. When a cell is completely contained within a cube, its overlap list is cleared, and objects in it are not intersected against each other (unless they both also overlap the same other, noncovered, cell). These techniques combine to reduce the expected computation time to linear in the number of cubes, regardless of the number of intersections. In the slowest step of UNION 3, which is testing pairs of objects in each cell for intersection, no inter-cell communication is required. Therefore UNION 3 parallelizes quite well. 1...|$|R

During the perfusion experiments we observed the effects of blood constituents on the function and metabolism of the perfused brain and obtained the following results. 1. When a low molecular dextran is used as the colloid osmotic pressure agent instead of hydrodextran, the amount of the blood flow in the brain is maintained roughly at a certain fixed level throughout the experiment, showing no gradual decreasing tendency. 2. When using the artificial blood supplemented with glutamic acid, EEG of the perfused brain shows an increase in the appearance rate of &# 946; 32 and &# 946; 33 bands, approaching closely to the pattern of EEG of unrestrained controls at arousal state. 3.

At the same time, the 4th Marine Battalion was ordered to locate the crashed helicopter and recover {{the bodies of the}} dead American crewmen. Acting against the advice of his American advisor, Major Nguyễn Văn Nho, commander of the 4th Marine Battalion, sent his 2/4th Marine Battalion company out to the Quảng Giao rubber plantation. Unknown to the 4th Marine Battalion, the Viet Cong 271st Regiment had assembled <b>in</b> the plantation. <b>About</b> <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> after they had departed from the village of Bình Giã, the commander of the 2/4th Marine Battalion reported via radio that his troops had found the helicopter wreckage, and the bodies of four American crewmen.

In an attempt to save the 2nd Company, the entire 4th Marine Battalion was sent out to confront the Viet Cong. As the lead element of the 4th Marine Battalion closed in on the Quảng Giao plantation, they were hit by accurate Viet Cong artillery fire, which was soon followed by repeated human wave attacks.

His first ascent was from the Green Park, London, on 19 July 1821, by order of the government, at the {{coronation}} of George IV, in the first ever balloon filled with carburetted hydrogen gas. The trip got into trouble {{and he had to}} be rescued by a passing ship captained by the mate, Francis Cheesman, who ran the silk through with his bowsprit, releasing the gas. After that time he made 526 ascents. On 16 August 1828 he ascended from the Eagle Tavern, City Road, {{on the back of his}} pony, and after being up for half an hour descended at Beckenham in Kent. In 1836 he constructed the Great Nassau balloon for Gye and Hughes, proprietors of Vauxhall Gardens, from whom he subsequently purchased it for 500 pounds, and on 9 September in that year made the first ascent with it from Vauxhall Gardens, in company with eight persons, and, after remaining <b>in</b> the air <b>about</b> <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> and a half, descended at Cliffe, near Gravesend.
