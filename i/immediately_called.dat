5|$|The Reichstag fire {{occurred}} {{on the night of}} 27 February 1933. Göring {{was one of the first}} to arrive on the scene. Marinus van der Lubbe—a communist radical—was arrested and claimed sole responsibility for the fire. Göring <b>immediately</b> <b>called</b> for a crackdown on communists.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{left the}} {{territory}} for business in Kentucky {{shortly after the}} meeting with Tecumseh, and secretary John Gibson was acting governor. Gibson, who had lived among the Miami tribe for many years, was quick to learn of Tecumseh's plans for war; he <b>immediately</b> <b>called</b> out the territory's militia and sent emergency letters calling {{for the return of}} Harrison. By mid-September, most of the militia regiments had formed. By then, Harrison had returned, accompanied by a small force of army regulars, and had taken command of the militia. Harrison had already communicated with his superiors in Washington, D.C., and he had been authorized to march against the confederacy in a show of force, in the hopes that its members would accept peace.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Wilder {{relocated}} to Paris, accepting {{a leading role}} in Bud Yorkin's Start the Revolution Without Me, a comedy that took place during the French Revolution. After shooting ended, Wilder returned to New York, where he read the script for Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx and <b>immediately</b> <b>called</b> Sidney Glazier, who produced The Producers. Both men began searching for the perfect director for the film. Jean Renoir was the first candidate, but {{he would not be able}} to do the film for at least a year, so British-Indian director Waris Hussein was hired. With Margot Kidder co-starring with Wilder, it was filmed on location in Dublin, and at the nearby Ardmore Studios, in August and September 1969.|$|E

5|$|In early 1969, Quaife {{told the}} band he was leaving. The other members {{did not take}} his {{statement}} seriously, until an article appeared in New Musical Express on 4 April featuring Quaife's new band, Maple Oak, which he had formed without telling {{the rest of the}} Kinks. Ray Davies pleaded with him to return for the sessions for their upcoming album, but Quaife refused. Davies <b>immediately</b> <b>called</b> up John Dalton, who had filled in for Quaife in the past, as a replacement. Dalton remained with the group until 1977, when the album Sleepwalker was released.|$|E
5|$|Many Katangese gendarmes {{and their}} {{mercenary}} leaders {{took refuge in}} Angola to reorganise, acting under orders from Tshombe. In 1964, Tshombe was welcomed back to the Congo and made prime minister. He <b>immediately</b> <b>called</b> on his forces to suppress communist revolts {{in the east and}} centre of the country. This they accomplished but Tshombe was dismissed from his post in 1965, ultimately losing all contact with them following his imprisonment in Algeria in 1967. Relations between the new central government and the gendarmes soured and after a mutiny was repressed, they returned to Angola. An insurgency for Katangese secession continued until late 2016.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell {{made this}} {{announcement}} on a Saturday when most Football League clubs, including Oxford and Reading, were playing League fixtures. Oxford were playing away at Doncaster Rovers. Jim Smith {{learned of the}} announcement shortly before kick-off at Doncaster's Belle Vue ground from John Ley, a journalist with the Oxford Mail, who had heard the news from another newsman by telephone. Smith <b>immediately</b> <b>called</b> Maxwell to ask {{whether or not he}} would be retained to manage Thames Valley Royals, and was told that he would be.|$|E

5|$|The crowd {{moved away}} from the {{immediate}} area of the custom house, but continued to grow in nearby streets. Captain Preston <b>immediately</b> <b>called</b> out most of the 29th Regiment, which adopted defensive positions in front of the state house. Acting Governor Thomas Hutchinson was summoned to the scene, and was forced by the movement of the crowd into the council chamber of the state house. From its balcony he was able to minimally restore order, promising there would be a fair inquiry into the shootings if the crowd dispersed.|$|E
5|$|The {{party was}} {{according}} to political scientist Cas Mudde only very rarely accused of anti-Semitism – and even then, it was strongly condemned {{by the party}} leadership. When Roeland Raes {{cast doubt on the}} scale of the Holocaust in a television interview in 2001 for instance, the party leadership <b>immediately</b> <b>called</b> an emergency meeting, distanced itself from him and forced him to resign. The party also took screening measures against its local candidates to reveal any possible extremist connections, and rather wanted to risk not being able to fill its lists, rather than filling them with extremists. Particularly, the party wanted to distance itself from Holocaust denial, as it actively sought to reach out to Jewish voters in Antwerp.|$|E
5|$|When De Simone's mother, Mary Sedotti, {{discovered}} {{she had not}} returned home by the morning, she expressed concern, and her husband Michael, Teresa's stepfather, drove to the pub where he observed DeSimone's car still parked, but did not make any closer investigation. Shortly after 10:00, Anthony Pocock, the landlord of the Tom Tackle, was expecting a commercial delivery to the premises, and believing DeSimone had deliberately left the car overnight he {{decided to try to}} move it to allow the delivery through. Inside he discovered DeSimone's partially clothed body on the back seat. He <b>immediately</b> <b>called</b> the police.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in August 1914, Mercer was amongst those <b>immediately</b> <b>called</b> upon by Hughes to establish and build a Canadian Expeditionary Force. Ordered to take his regiment to Camp Valcartier near Quebec City at 12.30 on the 4 August, Mercer worked in his law office until 12.00 before arriving on time at the barracks in uniform. Within days he had been promoted to Temporary Brigadier-General in command of the 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade which consisted of the first four battalions of the Expeditionary Force recruited in Ontario. Amongst these men his militiamen were dispersed, intended to spread experience and morale amongst the raw recruits. At the end of September, after just under two months training, the brigade departed on the 20-day sea voyage to Britain as the first installment of the Canadian Expeditionary Force.|$|E
5|$|Not long after, on 13 May Governor Sir Philip Game {{dismissed}} the Lang government and called upon the Leader of the Opposition and UAP Leader Bertram Stevens {{to form a}} caretaker government. Stevens formed a coalition with Bruxner's Country Party and <b>immediately</b> <b>called</b> an election. Lang's NSW Labor Party was heavily defeated and the Country Party gained eleven seats and held five seats on the cabinet. Bruxner retained his seat again unopposed (he would be elected unopposed {{a total of five}} times during his term). This time, the Country Party was an equal partner in the coalition and Bruxner was named as the first Deputy Premier of New South Wales. Sworn in on 16 May 1932 as Minister for Transport, Bruxner also briefly resumed his former Local Government portfolio during the caretaker period until 17 June 1932.|$|E
5|$|Residents of Cove Neck <b>immediately</b> <b>called</b> {{emergency}} services. Jeff Race, {{a paramedic}} {{and member of}} New York City's Emergency Medical Service who lived {{half a mile from}} the crash site was the first rescuer on site. He reported that most passengers were still strapped in their seats and the survivors were crying out for help. Survivors later commented that it took about half an hour for rescue teams to arrive. Initial reports to emergency services reported that a much larger Boeing 747 had crashed. Fire Chief Thomas Reardon of Oyster Bay Fire Company No. 1 {{was in charge of the}} initial effort to remove people from the wreckage. In his first call to the Nassau County Fire Commission dispatch, he requested all the help available. Thirty-seven fire and ambulance companies, as well as more than seven hundred Nassau County police officers arrived to help. Other companies that were not called showed up voluntarily to assist. The swell of support created major problems for extricating survivors.|$|E

5|$|The 1970 {{election}} {{included all}} of the civilian leaders of the country since independence with Apithy, Ahomadégbé, Maga, and Zinsou running against one another. The military decided to hold the elections on a staggered schedule with {{different areas of the}} country voting on different dates. This staggering meant that each of the candidates strategically tried to gain votes in later voting regions based upon the earlier results: bribery and irregularities in the election were rampant. Just before voting began in Atakora, the last department to vote which was a stronghold for Maga, Ahomadégbé supporters instigated violence to undercut turnout. Maga would have won the presidency if he had earned the most votes in Atakora, but instead of allowing the vote to go forward, de Souza suspended the election and <b>immediately</b> <b>called</b> on all sides to come to an agreement forming the next government.|$|E
5|$|Al-Ma'mun {{had made}} no {{official}} provisions for his succession. His son, al-Abbas, was old enough and had acquired experience in the border wars with the Byzantines, but had not been named heir. According to the account in al-Tabari, on his deathbed, al-Ma'mun dictated a letter nominating his brother, rather than al-Abbas, as his successor, and Abu Ishaq was acclaimed as Caliph on 9 August, {{with the name of}} al-Mu'tasim. It is impossible to know whether this reflects actual events, or whether the letter was an invention and Abu Ishaq merely took advantage of his proximity to his dying brother, and al-Abbas's absence elsewhere, to propel himself to the throne. As Abu Ishaq was the forefather of all subsequent Abbasid caliphs, historians had little desire to question the legitimacy of his accession, {{but it is clear that}} his position was far from secure: a large part of the army favoured al-Abbas, and a delegation of soldiers even went to him and tried to proclaim him as the new Caliph. Only when al-Abbas himself refused, whether out of weakness or out of a desire to avoid a civil war, and himself took the oath of allegiance to his uncle, did the soldiers acquiesce to al-Mu'tasim's succession. The precariousness of his position is further evidenced by the fact that al-Mu'tasim <b>immediately</b> <b>called</b> off the expedition, abandoned the Tyana project and returned with his army to Baghdad, which he reached on 20 September.|$|E
5|$|Escobar's manager, Lou Brix and his trainer {{recognized}} that Escobar {{could be close}} to a championship fight once the incumbent, Panamian Alfonso Teófilo Brown, refused to defend the championship against the first contender, which led to it being stripped by the National Boxing Association (NBA). A rematch was then organized against Leitham. This was an eliminatory card organized by the Montreal Athletic Commission, which was to determine a contender for their vacant Bantamweight World Championship, against first contender Baby Casanova, who attended the card. After scoring three knockdowns in the fourth round, Escobar connected another punch that injured Leitham, after which Leitham's manager surrendered the fight. This marked Leitham's last fight. Following this result, the NBA <b>immediately</b> <b>called</b> for a fight between Escobar and Casanova. By this time he had gained {{a reputation as a}} quick and technical boxer, capable of gathering quick knockouts with body punches if confronted by an unprepared opponent. The fight took place on June 26, 1934, and it was organized in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Escobar scored a knockdown in the third round; the fight concluded in the ninth round when Casanova lost by knockout. With this win, Escobar won the Montreal Athletic Commission World Bantamweight Title, thus becoming the first Puerto Rican to win a world boxing championship title. This {{had a significant impact on}} Puerto Rico, where it was constantly discussed by the general public. Songs, decimas and poetry were written about this accomplishment. However, the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) and International Boxing Union (IBU) of France didn't recognize the outcome of this fight, conserving Tony Marino and Brown as their recognized champions.|$|E

5|$|Honorius II died in {{the night}} 13/14 February 1130 in the Roman monastery of S. Gregorio, after a long illness. Cardinal Aymeric {{arranged}} a hasty burial there and <b>immediately</b> <b>called</b> {{the members of the}} committee to the monastery to proceed for the election of a new pope. But Cardinals Pierleoni and Gionata, realising that the commission certainly would elect a supporter of the Chancellor, withdrew from it hoping that a lack of quorum would prevent it from functioning. But Aymeric ignored this fact and the commission assembled with six members only. Despite the protests of Cardinal Pietro Pisano, who was a distinguished canonist, the committee elected one of its members, Cardinal Gregorio Papareschi of S. Angelo, who accepted the election and took the name Innocent II. He was enthroned in the Lateran Basilica early in the morning on February 14. His election was almost immediately recognized by six other cardinals: two bishops (Giovanni of Ostia and Mathieu of Albano) and four priests (Joselmo of S. Cecilia, Petrus of S. Anastasia and Giovanni of S. Crisogono; the identity of the fourth one is uncertain, but most probably it was Gerardo of S. Croce). In a short time they were joined also by the next eight cardinals.|$|E
