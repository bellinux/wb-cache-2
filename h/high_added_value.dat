Creativity and design in particular (as an activity: design skills, methods and processes) play a growing role in creating products and services with <b>high</b> <b>added</b> <b>value</b> to consumers. Design generates 50% of world export revenue in the creative industries' products (goods and services). The creative industry workforce is 3.1% of total employment in the European Union (EU), which creates a revenue that is 2.6% of the EU gross value. Creative industries have attained an unprecedented average annual growth rate of 8.7 per cent across the EU between 2000 and 2005.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade the organic market in the EU has grown faster than the organic {{agricultural}} area, {{which raises the question}} to what extent organic supply chains function effectively. Therefore, this study investigated the creation and distribution of <b>added</b> <b>value</b> in a number of organic supply chains in different EU countries. The results of the case studies suggest that <b>higher</b> <b>added</b> <b>value</b> is created in organic compared to conventional supply chains. However, no evidence was found that the relative share of organic farmers in the total <b>added</b> <b>value</b> differs substantially from that of conventional farmers. Also in organic food supply chains farmers capture a relative small proportion of <b>added</b> <b>value.</b> This can partly be explained by similarities of organic with conventional supply chains. It appears that the distribution of <b>added</b> <b>value</b> strongly depends on the structure and characteristics of the specific supply chain, such as level of chain integration and power relations between market players. No common patterns were identified regarding the impact of different types of retails and markets on the creation and distribution of <b>added</b> <b>value.</b> Investments in quality aspects, increased consumer interest in organic food, differentiation of products as well as efficiency in supply chain management are all relevant factors that contribute to <b>higher</b> <b>added</b> <b>value...</b>|$|R

This paper applies the flow analysis method developed in ecology to 638 trading flow networks of different products.

Then, it is pointed out that the flow networks of products with <b>higher</b> <b>added</b> <b>values</b> and complexity like machinary, transport equipment etc. have larger exponents, meaning that their trade flow networks are more hierarchical. As a result, without the extra data like global input-output table, we can identify the product categories with higher complexity, and the relative importance of a country in the global value chain by the trading network solely...|$|R
