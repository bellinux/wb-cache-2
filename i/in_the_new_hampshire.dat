5|$|In {{the initial}} contest, the 2012 Iowa caucuses of January 3, {{election}} officials announced Romney as ahead with 25percent of the vote, edging out a late-gaining Rick Santorum by eight votes (an also-strong Ron Paul finished third). Sixteen days later, however, they certified Santorum {{as the winner}} by a 34-vote margin. A week after the Iowa caucuses, Romney earned a decisive win <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> primary {{with a total of}} 39percent of the vote; Paul finished second and Jon Huntsman, Jr. third.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{entered the}} race for the Democratic Party's {{nomination}} for president on March 16, 1968â€”four days after Senator Eugene McCarthy received {{a large percentage of the}} vote <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> primary against the incumbent President (42% to Johnson's 49%). Two weeks later, a demoralized Johnson announced he was no longer seeking re-election. One month later, Vice President Hubert Humphrey announced he would seek the presidency. Humphrey did not participate in any primaries but he did obtain the support of many Democratic Party delegates. Following the California primary, Kennedy was in second place with 393delegates compared to Humphrey's 561 and McCarthy's 258.|$|E

In November 1987, Robinson met his partner, Mark Andrew, while on vacation in St. Croix. Andrew was on vacation and worked in Washington, D.C., at the national office of the Peace Corps. On July 2, 1988, Robinson and Andrew {{moved into a new}} house and had it blessed by Bishop Douglas Theuner, an event which they considered to be the formal recognition of their life together. Andrew currently works <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> state government.|$|E
5|$|While having name recognition, McGovern {{had little}} funding or staff, {{although}} he did garner critical funding from some celebrities and statesmen. He won a surprise third-place showing in the Iowa caucuses amidst a crowded field of candidates, but finished fifth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> primary. He announced he would drop out unless he finished first or second in the Massachusetts primary, {{and when he came}} in third behind his former campaign manager Gary Hart and former Vice President Walter Mondale, he made good on his promise. He later endorsed Mondale, the eventual Democratic nominee. McGovern hosted Saturday Night Live on April 14, 1984.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the 1952 New Hampshire primary, no {{candidate}} had won Truman's backing. His first choice, Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson, had declined to run; Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson had also turned Truman down, Vice President Barkley was considered too old, and Truman distrusted and disliked Senator Kefauver, who had {{made a name for himself}} by his investigations of the Truman administration scandals. Truman had hoped to recruit General Eisenhower as a Democratic candidate, but found him more interested in seeking the Republican nomination. Accordingly, Truman let his name be entered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> primary by supporters. The highly unpopular Truman was handily defeated by Kefauver; 18 days later the president announced he would not seek a second full term. Truman was eventually able to persuade Stevenson to run, and the governor gained the nomination at the 1952 Democratic National Convention.|$|E

5|$|Born {{in rural}} Connecticut, Allen had a {{frontier}} upbringing but also received an education that included some philosophical teachings. In the late 1760s he became interested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> Grants, buying land there and becoming embroiled {{in the legal}} disputes surrounding the territory. Legal setbacks {{led to the formation}} of the Green Mountain Boys, whom Allen led in a campaign of intimidation and property destruction to drive New York settlers from the Grants. When the American Revolutionary War broke out, Allen and the Boys seized the initiative and captured Fort Ticonderoga in May 1775. In September 1775 Allen led a failed attempt on Montreal that resulted in his capture by British authorities. First imprisoned aboard Royal Navy ships, he was paroled in New York City, and finally released in a prisoner exchange in 1778.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} vote of 2008, she placed {{third in the}} January 3 Iowa Democratic caucus behind Obama and Edwards. Obama gained ground in {{national}} polling {{in the next few}} days, with all polls predicting a victory for him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> primary. Clinton gained a surprise win there on January 8, defeating Obama narrowly. It was the first time a woman had won a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection. Explanations for Clinton's New Hampshire comeback varied but often centered on her being seen more sympathetically, especially by women, after her eyes welled with tears and her voice broke while responding to a voter's question the day before the election.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} tumultuous primary {{election}} seasons ever began as the Tet Offensive was launched, followed by the withdrawal of President Johnson as a candidate after doing unexpectedly poorly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> primary; it concluded with the assassination {{of one of the}} Democratic candidates, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, just moments after his victory in the California primary. On the Republican side, Nixon's main opposition was Michigan Governor George Romney, though New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller and California Governor Ronald Reagan each hoped to be nominated in a brokered convention. Nixon secured the nomination on the first ballot. He selected Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew as his running mate, a choice which Nixon believed would unite the party, appealing to both Northern moderates and Southerners disaffected with the Democrats.|$|E

5|$|Pierce {{actively}} campaigned in {{his district}} on behalf of Jackson, who carried both the district and the nation by large margins in the November 1828 election, even though he lost New Hampshire. The outcome further strengthened the Democratic Party, and Pierce won his first legislative seat the following year, representing Hillsborough <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> House of Representatives. Pierce's father, meanwhile, was elected again as governor, retiring after that term. The younger Pierce was appointed {{as chairman of the}} House Education Committee in 1829 and the Committee on Towns the following year. By 1831 the Democrats held a legislative majority, and Pierce was elected Speaker of the House. The young Speaker used his platform to oppose the expansion of banking, protect the state militia, and offer support to the national Democrats and Jackson's re-election effort. At the age of 27, he was a star of the New Hampshire Democratic Party. Though attaining early political and professional success, in his personal letters he continued to lament his bachelorhood and yearned for a life beyond Hillsborough.|$|E
