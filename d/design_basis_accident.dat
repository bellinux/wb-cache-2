2500|$|For a {{pressurized}} water reactor, the containment also encloses the steam generators and the pressurizer, {{and is the}} entire reactor building. The missile shield around it is typically a tall cylindrical or domed building. [...] PWR containments are typically large (up to 10 times larger than a BWR) because the containment strategy during the leakage <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accident</b> entails providing adequate volume for the steam/air mixture that results from a loss-of-coolant-accident to expand into, limiting the ultimate pressure (driving force for leakage) reached in the containment building.|$|E

The containment designs are referred to by the names Mark I, Mark II, and Mark III.

40|$|Consistent with {{established}} Advanced Neutron Source (ANS) project {{policy for the}} use of probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) in design, a task has been established to use PRA techniques to help guide the design and safety analysis of the ANS cold sources. The work discussed in this report is the first formal output of the cold source PRA task. The major output at this stage is a list of <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accidents,</b> categorized into approximate frequency categories. This output is expected to focus attention on continued design work to define and optimize the design such that <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accidents</b> are better defined and have acceptable outcomes. Categorizing the <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> events (DBEs) into frequency categories should prove helpful because it will allow appropriate acceptance criteria to be applied. Because the design of the cold source is still proceeding, it {{is beyond the scope of}} this task to produce detailed event probability calculations or even, in some cases, detailed event sequence definitions. That work would take place as a logically planned follow-on task, to be completed as the design matures.

40|$|This PhD {{thesis is}} on Pre-operational Tests and <b>Design</b> <b>Basis</b> <b>Accidents</b> Analyses for a {{generation}} III+ Nuclear Power Plant. The very first milestone of the present work has been {{the development of a}} fully detailed Relap 5 model of the selected Nuclear Power Plant design, which can be used to simulate a variety of steady state and transient conditions. The developed Relap 5 model has been extensively used in this work, which can be thought as divided in two main parts. In the first part, pre-operational tests procedures have been investigated and pre-tests calculations have been performed for three selected pre-operational tests which need to be successfully executed as one of the steps for the licensing of the selected generation III+ Nuclear Power Plant. In {{the second part of the}} work, a combination among passive systems and an active one has been analyzed in order to evaluate the impact on transients progression (two <b>Design</b> <b>Basis</b> <b>Accidents</b> have been considered). Furthermore failure of the active feature has been taken into account to investigate whether a safety issue is raised upon active system failure once it has been put into operation, it has interacted with the passive features and has modified the plant conditions. This second part is towards a full application and exploitation of the defense in depth principle. Pre-tests calculations give good results, i. e. the goals of the tests are achieved. <b>Design</b> <b>Basis</b> <b>Accidents</b> simulations results demonstrate that a combination among passive features and the selected active one provides a better response in comparison to an accident management based exclusively on passive systems, and that no safety issue is raised upon failure of the active feature. Even if a particular generation III+ Nuclear Power Plant has been considered, the backbone of this work is absolutely general and can be extended to other generation III+ and generation IV Nuclear Power Plants...|$|R
40|$|In {{water-cooled}} {{nuclear power}} reactors, significant quantities of steam and hydrogen could be produced within the primary containment following the postulated <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accidents</b> (DBA) or beyond <b>design</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accidents</b> (BDBA). For accurate {{calculation of the}} temperature/pressure rise and hydrogen transport calculation in nuclear reactor containment due to such scenarios, wall condensation heat transfer coefficient (HTC) is used. In the present work, the adaptation of a commercial CFD code {{with the implementation of}} models for steam condensation on wall surfaces in presence of noncondensable gases is explained. Steam condensation has been modeled using the empirical average HTC, which was originally developed to be used for “lumped-parameter” (volume-averaged) modeling of steam condensation in the presence of noncondensable gases. The present paper suggests a generalized HTC based on curve fitting of most of the reported semiempirical condensation models, which are valid for specific wall conditions. The present methodology has been validated against limited reported experimental data from the COPAIN experimental facility. This is the first step towards the CFD-based generalized analysis procedure for condensation modeling applicable for containment wall surfaces that is being evolved further for specific wall surfaces within the multicompartment containment atmosphere...|$|R
