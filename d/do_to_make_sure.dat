6000|$|He freely {{consented to}} do as much as this, and, having called a cab that she might go her way with the girls, kissed her again as he had done at the exhibition. This was an {{attention}} that could never displease her, but somehow when he kissed her she was really the more worried: she had come to recognise it as a sign that he was slipping away from her, and she wished she might frankly take it as his clutch at her to save him. She drove off with a vague sense that at any rate she and the girls might do something toward keeping the place warm for him. She had been a little vexed that Peter had not administered more of a push toward the Hôtel de Hollande, clear as it had become to her now that there was a foreignness in Peter which was not to be counted on and which made him speak of English affairs and even of English domestic politics as local and even [...] "funny." [...] They were very grandly local, and if one recalled, in public life, an occasional droll incident wasn't that, liberally viewed, just the warm human comfort of them? As she left the two young men standing together {{in the middle of the}} Place de la Concorde, the grand composition of which Nick, as she looked back, appeared to have paused to admire--as if he hadn't seen it a thousand times!--she wished she might have thought of Peter's influence with her son as exerted a little more in favour of localism. She had a fear he wouldn't abbreviate the boy's ill-timed flânerie. However, he had been very nice: he had invited them all to dine with him that evening at a convenient café, promising to bring Julia and one of his colleagues. So much as this he had been willing to <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> Nick and his sister should meet. His want of localism, moreover, was not so great as that if it should turn out that there was anything beneath his manner toward Biddy--! The upshot of this reflexion might have been represented by the circumstance of her ladyship's remarking after a minute to her younger daughter, who sat opposite her in the voiture de place, that it would do no harm if she should get a new hat and that the search might be instituted that afternoon.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the end of}} {{its more}} than a year-long {{investigation}} of the Crocus Fund, the lead investigator for the Winnipeg Free Press, Dan Lett, concluded that [...] "Crocus was too healthy to kill." [...] "As I ....looked more closely at the Crocus timeline, it was clear there were some enormous blind spots. None of the Crocus critics, including the auditor general, had obtained a clear picture of why the fund stopped trading or whether any of its investments were successful. We know of the failures because they were highlighted in General Singleton's report. But the successful investments weren't really party of the story; instead, the successes were tucked into the deep recesses of the fund's portfolio. There were numerous and substantial winners. Many Crocus observers are familiar with companies like National Leasing Group and Pollard Banknote. But for every one of those companies there were others that flew under the radar: Medicure, Inc., Sequoia Energy, Cando Corporation, Mondetta Clothing. Many laughed at Crocus when it invested in the MTS Centre and the Manitoba Moose hockey team. Now that the new downtown arena is one of the busiest facilities of its kind in North America, the laughs have quieted.The fact is that in most respects, the Crocus portfolio was not all that unusual, {{at least as far as}} venture capital funds go. An internal portfolio analysis prepared in November 2004 shows that about one-third of the portfolio was proven winners, many of the home-run variety. Another third of the portfolio was in limbo, its prospects unclear. The last third represented losers made up of bad ideas as well as good ideas with bad execution? Many venture capitalists will tell you that is a pretty good foundation from which to operate.So why did Crocus fail? As the auditor general pointed out, Crocus had valuation and management problems. But…the deeper you dig into the portfolio and the drama behind the decision to cease trading in December 2004, the stronger the argument that these were not fatal flaws….If the problems were fixable and the fund could have continued, why didn’t someone step up and save it?Gripped by a battle over valuations, management…was a shambles near the end. The board of directors ultimately felt it had no choice but to cease trading and revalue the portfolio….Once the decision to cease trading was taken, the province really became the last line of defense. … Government should have focused on what it could <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> Crocus thrived when it came to making money for its investors. Instead the finance department obstructed fund managers as they tried to get changes to the Crocus Act to bring it into line with funds outside Manitoba.The end result was that Manitoba’s first labour-sponsored investment fund (LSIF) toiled on an uneven playing field maintained by bureaucrats who did not have the best interests of investors at heart. And when the fund’s board of directors was paralyzed by infighting at the fund, what did the NDP government do? It ran---not walked---away from Crocus as fast as it could.There could have been a better outcome for Crocus even after the decision to cease trading. In June 2005, a new board of directors and management asked the province for help in obtaining liability insurance and sought changes to the Crocus Act which would have allowed the fund to move forward on an equal footing with the rest of the LSIF industry. In response, the government uttered a terse “no.”The receivership that followed….has only eroded shareholder value. The Crocus portfolio was full of valuable, unique investments that could achieve their full value for investors only if the portfolio was sold intact; carving it up and selling it one piece at a time is nothing more than an elaborate fire sale that will leave investors much worse off than if the fund had continued under its own steam.Opposition politicians have tried to pin a scandal on the NDP government by alleging it knew Crocus was a confidence game and covered it up. By employing this strategy, they….have missed the real story. The NDP could have, should have, saved Crocus.By all reasonable measurements, Crocus was an unparalleled success story that created jobs and wealth in Manitoba….When it ran into trouble, there were more than enough people willing to turn their backs and let it slide into oblivion.Because in this town, that’s apparently what happens to successful people.The Fund’s former CEO, Sherman Kreiner, subsequently sued the Provincial Auditor General to attempt to compel it to change its investigative practices. Kreiner alleged that the investigation was conducted in bad faith, that many of those named in the report were denied the opportunity to view it before it was released, that he and others were not interviewed until immediately prior to the report being released, suggesting the Auditor General came to its conclusions before interviewing all of the principals.|$|E
