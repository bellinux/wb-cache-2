5|$|Even if a {{molecule}} does not form a permanent dipole, {{it can still}} be influenced by an electric field. In some cases, the field produces slight re-arrangement of electrons and protons in molecules such that an induced electric dipole results. While {{not as strong as}} permanent <b>dipoles,</b> orientation with the external field still occurs.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{magnetic}} fields on liquid crystal molecules are analogous to electric fields. Because magnetic fields are generated by moving electric charges, permanent magnetic <b>dipoles</b> {{are produced by}} electrons moving about atoms. When a magnetic field is applied, the molecules will tend to align with or against the field.|$|E
5|$|The metal form is {{slightly}} paramagnetic, meaning its magnetic <b>dipoles</b> align with external magnetic fields, but will assume random orientations once {{the field is}} removed. Pure, metallic, single-crystal technetium becomes a type-II superconductor at temperatures below 7.46K. Below this temperature, technetium has a very high magnetic penetration depth, greater than any other element except niobium.|$|E
40|$|The total <b>dipole</b> {{moment of}} a pair of {{isolated}} water molecules that employ a point polarizable <b>dipole</b> is compared with the total <b>dipole</b> moment obtained from MP 4 calculations for the same intermolecular orientation and distance. At all reasonable intermolecular distances, the point <b>dipole</b> models give total <b>dipole</b> moments that are generally in very good agreement with MP 4. This suggests that the point polarizable <b>dipole</b> approximation for water is reasonable and that the high <b>dipole</b> moments obtained frequently in molecular simulations of polarizable water must be attributed to something other than the inadequacy of the point <b>dipole</b> approximation...|$|R

5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{director}} to align along an external field {{is caused by the}} electric nature of the molecules. Permanent electric <b>dipoles</b> result when one end of a molecule has a net positive charge while the other end has a net negative charge. When an external electric field is applied to the liquid crystal, the dipole molecules tend to orient themselves along the direction of the field.|$|E
5|$|Early EMA {{systems like}} Hixon's had {{problems}} with accounting for tilting of the tongue during use as tilting of the sensor coils causes changes in the induced current that can skew data. In 1987, Paul Schönle et al. published an improved system that used three transmitter coils (analogous to Hixon's generator coil) and computer software to triangulate the position of sensor coils and account for tilt. However modern two-dimensional systems are still unable to compensate for tilting of sensors past 30 degrees and measurement is distorted if sensor coils are moved off the centerline of the mouth. In 1993, Andreas Zierdt published a description of an articulograph that {{would be able to}} measure movement in three dimensions, though three dimensional articulographs have only been commercially available since around 2009. Zierdt's conceptualization placed six transmitter coils equidistant from each other. Because sensor coils are <b>dipoles,</b> when they are perpendicular to a transmitter coil the current induced is zero, so Zierdt angled the transmitter coils so that for any given rotation of a sensor coil, it was not perpendicular to more than three transmitter coils allowing for at least three transmitter coils to triangulate the position of the sensor.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen may be usefully {{compared}} to its horizontal neighbours carbon and oxygen {{as well as}} its vertical neighbours in the pnictogen column (phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth). Although each period 2 element from lithium to nitrogen shows some similarities to the period 3 element in the next group from magnesium to sulfur (known as the diagonal relationships), their degree drops off quite abruptly past the boron–silicon pair, so that the similarities of nitrogen to sulfur are mostly limited to sulfur nitride ring compounds when both elements are the only ones present. Nitrogen resembles oxygen far more than it does carbon with its high electronegativity and concomitant capability for hydrogen bonding and the ability to form coordination complexes by donating its lone pairs of electrons. It does not share carbon's proclivity for catenation, with the longest chain of nitrogen yet discovered being composed of only eight nitrogen atoms (PhN=N–N(Ph)–N=N–N(Ph)–N=NPh). One property nitrogen does share with both its horizontal neighbours is its preferentially forming multiple bonds, typically with carbon, nitrogen, or oxygen atoms, through pπ–pπ interactions; thus, for example, nitrogen occurs as diatomic molecules and thus has very much lower melting (−210°C) and boiling points (−196°C) than the rest of its group, as the N2 molecules are only held together by weak van der Waals interactions and there are very few electrons available to create significant instantaneous <b>dipoles.</b> This is not possible for its vertical neighbours; thus, the nitrogen oxides, nitrites, nitrates, nitro-, nitroso-, azo-, and diazo-compounds, azides, cyanates, thiocyanates, and imino-derivatives find no echo with phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth. By the same token, however, the complexity of the phosphorus oxoacids finds no echo with nitrogen.|$|E

25|$|Above, {{discussion}} was deferred {{for the first}} term in the expression for the potential due to the <b>dipoles.</b> Integrating the divergence results in a surface charge. The figure at the right provides an intuitive idea of why a surface charge arises. The figure shows a uniform array of identical <b>dipoles</b> between two surfaces. Internally, the heads and tails of <b>dipoles</b> are adjacent and cancel. At the bounding surfaces, however, no cancellation occurs. Instead, on one surface the dipole heads create a positive surface charge, while at the opposite surface the dipole tails create a negative surface charge. These two opposite surface charges create a net electric field in a direction opposite to {{the direction of the}} <b>dipoles.</b>|$|E
25|$|Charging a {{capacitor}} (due to a voltage between the capacitor plates) causes an electric field {{to be applied}} to the dielectric between the electrodes. This field exerts a torque on the molecular <b>dipoles,</b> causing the directions of the dipole moments to align with the field direction. This change in the molecular <b>dipoles</b> is called oriented polarization and also causes heat to be generated, resulting in dielectric losses (see dissipation factor). The orientation of the <b>dipoles</b> does not follow the electric field synchronously, but is delayed by a time constant that depends on the material. This delay corresponds to a hysteresis response of the polarization to the external field.|$|E
25|$|This {{originates}} from {{permanent and}} induced <b>dipoles</b> aligning to an electric field. Their orientation polarisation is disturbed by thermal noise (which mis-aligns the dipole vectors {{from the direction}} of the field), and the time needed for <b>dipoles</b> to relax is determined by the local viscosity. These two facts make dipole relaxation heavily dependent on temperature, pressure and chemical surrounding.|$|E

The <b>dipole</b> effect is practically used for VTH tuning in the band-edge metal/high-k gate stack CMOS. The optimum conditions might be found by changing the material and/or process conditions, {{but there is still}} a missing fact in the high-k/SiO 2 <b>dipole</b> formation experiment. It is the <b>dipole</b> cancellation (counter <b>dipole</b> formation) in SiO 2 /high-k/SiO 2 /Si gate stacks. This paper reports experimental results on the counter <b>dipole</b> effect...|$|R
5000|$|A dipole-induced <b>dipole</b> {{interaction}} (Debye force) {{is due to}} {{the approach}} of a molecule with a permanent <b>dipole</b> to another non-polar molecule with no permanent <b>dipole.</b> This approach causes the electrons of the non-polar molecule to be polarized toward or away from the <b>dipole</b> (or [...] "induce" [...] a <b>dipole)</b> of the approaching molecule. Specifically, the <b>dipole</b> can cause electrostatic attraction or repulsion of the electrons from the non-polar molecule, depending on orientation of the incoming <b>dipole.</b> Atoms with larger atomic radii are considered more [...] "polarizable" [...] and therefore experience greater attraction {{as a result of the}} Debye force.|$|R

25|$|If we {{suppose the}} {{polarization}} of the <b>dipoles</b> was induced by an external field, the polarization field opposes the applied field and sometimes {{is called a}} depolarization field.

50|$|A {{permanent}} electric <b>dipole</b> {{moment of}} a fundamental particle violates both parity (P) and time reversal symmetry (T). These violations {{can be understood}} by examining the neutron's magnetic <b>dipole</b> moment and hypothetical electric <b>dipole</b> moment. Under time reversal, the magnetic <b>dipole</b> moment changes its direction, whereas the electric <b>dipole</b> moment stays unchanged. Under parity, the electric <b>dipole</b> moment changes its direction but not the magnetic <b>dipole</b> moment. As the resulting system under P and T is not symmetric {{with respect to the}} initial system, these symmetries are violated {{in the case of the}} existence of an EDM. Having also CPT symmetry, the combined symmetry CP is violated as well.|$|R
25|$|<b>Dipoles</b> {{that are}} {{much smaller than the}} {{wavelength}} of the signal are called short <b>dipoles.</b> These have a very low radiation resistance (and a high capacitive reactance) making them inefficient antennas.

40|$|Instead of {{starting}} from a theoretically motivated {{form of the}} color <b>dipole</b> cross section in the <b>dipole</b> picture of deep inelastic scattering, we start with a parametrization of the deep inelastic structure function for electromagnetic scattering with protons, and then extract the color <b>dipole</b> cross section.

25|$|Theoretically, an {{electric}} dipole {{is defined by}} the first-order term of the multipole expansion, and consists of two equal and opposite charges infinitely close together. This is unrealistic, as real <b>dipoles</b> have separated charge. However, because the charge separation is very small compared to everyday lengths, the error introduced by treating real <b>dipoles</b> like they are theoretically perfect is usually negligible. The direction of dipole is usually defined from the negative charge towards the positive charge.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dipoles</b> whose {{length is}} {{approximately}} half the wavelength {{of the signal}} are called half-wave <b>dipoles</b> and are widely used as such or {{as the basis for}} derivative antenna designs. These have a radiation resistance which is much greater, closer to the characteristic impedances of available transmission lines, and normally much larger than the resistance of the conductors, so that their efficiency approaches 100%. In general radio engineering, the term dipole, if not further qualified, is taken to mean a center-fed half-wave dipole.|$|E
25|$|The {{system worked}} by having two dipole antennas instead of one, {{slightly}} offset {{on either side}} of the mounting mast projecting through the middle of the parabolic dish. Being offset, the beams produced by the two <b>dipoles</b> were angled away from each other, to either side of the dish centreline. Normally the signals from both were added together and displayed, producing an output largely identical to the single-dipole case. The dipole shaft was mounted on another motor that rapidly spun them at 800rpm. A switch was placed so that it was triggered by the motor when the <b>dipoles</b> were roughly vertical or roughly horizontal, triggering a second circuit that subtracted the signals from each other instead of adding. The result was the difference in signal strength, which indicated which of the two <b>dipoles</b> was receiving more energy at that instant. This signal was fed into the scanner motors, driving it in the right direction.|$|E
