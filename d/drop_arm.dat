40|$|OBJECTIVE—Subacromial {{impingement}} syndrome (SIS) is {{a frequent}} cause of shoulder pain. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the diagnostic values of clinical diagnostic tests, in patients with SIS.  METHODS— 72 female, 48  male patients with shoulder pain were included in the study. Five had bilateral shoulder pain, so 125  painful shoulders were evaluated. Details were recorded about the patients' ages and sexes, as well as characteristics of pain and related problems. Detailed physical examination and routine laboratory tests were performed. Conventional radiography and subsequent magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder region of all patients were performed. Patients were divided into two groups according to the results of subacromial injection test, a reference standard test for SIS. Test positive patients constituted SIS group and test negative patients the non-SIS group. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive values of some clinical diagnostic tests such as Neer, Hawkins, horizontal adduction, painful arc, <b>drop</b> <b>arm,</b> Yergason and Speed tests for SIS were determined by using 2  ×  2  table.  RESULTS—The most sensitive diagnostic tests were found to be Hawkins test (92. 1 %), Neer test (88. 7 %) and horizontal adduction test (82. 0 %). Tests with highest specificity were <b>drop</b> <b>arm</b> test (97. 2 %), Yergason test (86. 1 %) and painful arc test (80. 5 %) consecutively.  CONCLUSION—The highly sensitive tests seem to have low specificity values and the highly specific ones to have low sensitivity values. Although this finding suggests that these diagnostic tests are insufficient for certain diagnosis, it is suggested they play an important part in clinical evaluation. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: It {{is unknown}} which {{combination}} of patient information and clinical tests might be optimal for {{the diagnosis of}} rotator cuff tears. This study aimed to determine the diagnostic value of nine individual clinical tests for evaluating rotator cuff tear {{and to develop a}} prediction model for diagnosing rotator cuff tear. Methods: This prospective cohort study included 169 patients with shoulder complaints. Patients who reported a previous shoulder dislocation were excluded from the analysis (N = 69). One experienced clinician conducted 25 clinical tests of which 9 are specifically designed to diagnose rotator cuff pathology (empty can, Neer, Hawkins-Kenney, <b>drop</b> <b>arm,</b> lift-off test, painful arc, external rotation lag sign, drop sign, infraspinatus muscle strength test). The final diagnosis, based on magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA), was determined by consensus between the clinician and a radiologist, who were blinded to patient information. A prediction model was developed by logistic regression analysis. Results and discussion: In this cohort, 38 patients were diagnosed with rotator cuff tears. The individual overall accuracy of the rotator cuff clinical tests was 61 %- 75 %. After backward selection, the model determined that the most important predictors of rotator cuff tears were higher age and a positive Neer test. This internally validated prediction model had good discriminative ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0. 73). Conclusion: Our results showed that individual clinical shoulder tests had moderate diagnostic value for diagnosing rotator cuff tear. Our prediction model showed improved diagnostic value. However, the prediction value is still relatively low, supporting a low threshold for additional diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of rotator cuff tears.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Background: Vitamin {{insufficiency}} and deficiency may {{be associated}} with increased risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, some cancers and all cause mortality. Practice guidelines define sufficient vitamin D status as a serum 25 -hydroxycholecalciferol (25 -OHD) concentration > 30 ng/mL (70 nmol/L). Supplementation strategies to safely achieve vitamin D sufficiency are needed. Objective: We evaluated the change in serum 25 -OHD concentrations after supplementation with three commercially available vitamin D 3 products with different vehicles of delivery: a chewable tablet; a liquid drop; and a encapsulated powder. Methods: The clinical trial design was a prospective, randomized, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness study of vitamin D 3 supplementation. We conducted third-party analysis of the three commercially available vitamin D 3 supplements used in this trial. Subjects were provisioned informed consent and randomized to one of the three vitamin D 3 supplements, dosed at 10, 000 IU per day for 12 weeks, per label claim. Results: Eligible subjects (n= 66) were enrolled in the study, of which 11 subjects were lost to follow up (17 %). 100 % of the subjects in the tablet and capsule allocation arms attained sufficient vitamin D status, compared to 80 % in the oil <b>drop</b> <b>arm.</b> The mean (±SD) change in 25 -OHD (ng/mL) from baseline to week 12 reached the level of statistical significance (p< 0. 001) {{for each of the three}} allocation groups: tablet (n= 18); 31. 8 (7. 6); oil drop (n= 20); 32. 2 (8. 0); and capsule (n= 17); 48. 1 (8. 1). Between group changes in serum 25 -OHD were also significant (ANOVA; p< 0. 05). While pairwise-comparisons of changes in serum 25 -OHD showed a statistically significant difference, distinguishing Group C from Groups A and B (Tukey's Test; p< 0. 05). Three non-serious adverse events occurred during the study, without observed hypercalcemia or hypervitaminosis D. Discussion: We observed variability in vitamin D 3 concentration in the three supplements, with the tablet and capsule showing increased D 3 concentration, compared to label claim. The majority of subjects (93 %) achieved sufficient 25 -OHD status at the end of the study. We conclude that 10, 000 IU vitamin D 3 per day for 12 -weeks may be a safe and effective strategy for vitamin D supplementation to correct nutritional deficiency in 25 -OHD insufficient populations.

40|$|Diagnosing {{shoulder}} pain {{conditions is}} a challenging area of musculoskeletal practice. Subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) is a clinical syndrome that indicates pain and pathology involving the subacromial bursa and rotator cuff tendons within the subacromial space. The three stages of SIS are subacromial bursitis, partial thickness and full thickness rotator cuff tears. The cause of SIS {{is believed to}} be multi-factorial with both extrinsic and intrinsic factors involved in its pathogenesis. Clinicians have traditionally diagnosed SIS using a clinical examination including a subjective history followed by confirmatory clinical tests. A review of the evidence for diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests highlights that individual tests have poor diagnostic accuracy. A combination of clinical tests or a clinical examination per se may be useful at ruling out rotator cuff tears, but is less accurate at detecting rotator cuff tears when it is present. There is consensus in the literature that particular combinations of signs and clinical features may be useful in diagnosing rotator cuff tears but not for diagnosing SIS. The vast majority of research to date examining the clinical diagnosis of SIS has been focused on individual clinical tests carried out by medical practitioners in specialist and tertiary care settings. This review has established that the majority of diagnostic accuracy studies for SIS and rotator cuff tears have had poor methodological design. This exploratory study was conducted with subjects undergoing a standardized clinical examination (index test) by a physiotherapist. The decision as to which specific tests were chosen for this research was based on supporting research within the literature and the test’s actual use within the New Zealand clinical setting. This included subjective history questions, active and passive shoulder movement tests and eleven SIS tests. Subjects were referred for a diagnostic ultrasound scan immediately following the clinical examination and results from the scan stood as the criterion reference standard. Thirty eight individuals (males n= 23, females n= 15) with new onset shoulder pain, who met the inclusion criteria, were assessed by a participating physiotherapist. Sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratios, negative likelihood ratios and respective 95 % confidence intervals were calculated for all variables of the examination. Individual variables from the clinical examination were tested for their association with the diagnostic ultrasound scan reference criterion using Pearson Chi-Squared Exact test. Potential predictor variables were retained as potential predictors for use in the logistic regression analysis to determine the most accurate set of clinical examination variables for diagnosing SIS and the individual pathological stages of SIS. The results indicate that no historical, subjective or objective features from the clinical examination are accurate in diagnosing SIS or rotator cuff tears. The presence of night pain demonstrated a significant correlation (P< 0. 02) with the criterion reference standard for the presence of subacromial bursa fluid/bunching. Night pain and pain with overhead activity has a high sensitivity for subacromial bursa fluid/bunching being present. The absence of night pain and the absence of pain with overhead activity are two subjective phenomena from a clinical examination that are useful in ruling out subacromial bursa fluid/bunching being present. Night pain was also found to be the best predictor of subacromial bursa fluid/bunching being present (P< 0. 012). Male gender (P< 0. 034) was the best predictor of partial thickness rotator cuff tears while being 60 years of age or older (P< 0. 01) significantly correlated with full thickness rotator cuff tears. The <b>Drop</b> <b>Arm</b> Sign (P< 0. 01) and External Rotation Lag Sign (P< 0. 01) were significantly correlated with SIS and full thickness rotator cuff tears. Clinical tests for all three pathological stages of SIS and subacromial bursa fluid/bunching being present, had equivalent or if not greater diagnostic accuracy than previous report studies in the literature. The Hawkins-Kennedy Test and Neer Sign can be used in the primary care setting to rule out the presence of subacromial bursa fluid/bunching or SIS if the tests are negative. For mid to end stage SIS (rotator cuff tears) the Empty Can Test and <b>Drop</b> <b>Arm</b> Sign with their high sensitivity can be used to rule out rotator cuff tears especially to the supraspinatus tendon when the tests are negative. Despite the small sample size and other limitations of this study, the findings are an important addition to the current literature surrounding the diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests for SIS and rotator cuff tears. This is the first study to use physiotherapists as examiners and to be set in a primary care setting. The study is also the first to examine the diagnostic accuracy of a range of historical and subjective features from the clinical examination. The results found in the current study could be used by future studies as a starting point {{in the development of a}} clinical decision or prediction rule to assist clinicians in the diagnosis of SIS and rotator cuff tears...|$|E
