According to Nhapi (2004 a, b, c), cases of such a system are in places such as Gweru, Redcliff, Nemanwa and Mupandawana. In Gweru, the decentralized wastewater system started in 1994. In the town of Redcliff, there is evidence of decentralised wastewater treatment and management system as evidenced by the reuse of wastewater for agriculture. Septic tanks are a common wet technology that is used in areas with large plot sizes. The following technologies are used in Redcliff: duckweed pond systems, constructed wetlands and aquaculture. In Mupandawana and Nemanwa, the use and availability of duckweed pond systems provides an opportunity for the implementation of decentralized wastewater treatment and management systems (Nhapi 2004 a, b, c). In Zimbabwe, the effective implementation of <b>decentralised</b> wastewater <b>management</b> systems is affected by unavailability of data on basic design of the technologies.|$|R

The authors explore the organisational responses to competition of 14, 000 exporting firms in seven European countries. The paper examines the export business model of the median exporter and of the top one percent exporters in each country, accounting for 20 percent to 55 percent of total exports. What do these firms do to become superstars? The authors find, first, that the export market share of the median exporter {{in each of the}} countries to the world more than tripled (in some cases the export market share increases tenfold) for firms that combine <b>decentralised</b> <b>management</b> with offshoring of production to low-wage countries. Exporters which abstain from any organisational adjustment do very badly. <b>Decentralised</b> <b>management</b> provides incentives for workers for product improvements allowing exporters to compete on quality. Offshoring production to low-wage countries reduces costs allowing exporters to compete on price. Second, we find that Germany is the leading quality exporter in Europe followed by Austria and Spain. Among the top 10 percent of exporters there is no single firm with low quality in Germany and Austria, which suggest that <b>decentralised</b> <b>management</b> has provided incentives for quality in these countries. Third, Germany’s exports are less vulnerable to price increases, while exports from France and Italy respond strongly to price changes, and thus costs reductions via offshoring benefits these countries most...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{advantages and disadvantages}} with internal markets and different degrees of internal trading of services and supplies in the Norwegian Armed Forces. Different degrees of internal trading in armed forces relate mainly to the grade of internal pricing and centralised versus <b>decentralised</b> <b>management</b> of internal trading. The policy of internal pricing is common, but the level of management of internal markets varies between military capabilities and services. Overall, the support side, consisting of the Norwegian Defence Logistic Organisation and Norwegian Defence Estates Agency, seem to have advantages with this model, independent from degree of internal trading. On the other side, the operational side seems generally to have disadvantages with the internal markets. Furthermore, significant disadvantages were discovered for the units that have <b>decentralised</b> <b>management.</b> Additionally the organisation model derived {{by the process of}} creating internal markets seems to have some negative effects on the efficiency of the operational capabilities. The recommendation is to compensate the internal markets with more vertical management and less internal pricing.

30|$|The {{adoption}} of <b>decentralised</b> wastewater <b>management</b> systems in Harare is still minimal, {{regardless of the}} promises of such a concept. The City is used to the conventional centralised systems. A number of factors such as public acceptance, health and cost factors {{and the availability of}} alternative water sources rather than technical barriers (Nhapi 2004 a, b, c) influence {{the extent to which the}} decentralised concept of wastewater treatment and management will be implemented in Harare. Other contributing factors include regulations, convenience and organisations necessary for users if they are to make correct use of wastewater systems. The cost aspect of the decentralised systems is linked to technologies used and the size of population that is to be served by such as system. The technologies are locally available such as duckweed and septic tanks, hence no need for importing such technologies. The availability and cost of alternative water systems (surface, groundwater, rainwater harvesting) is also likely to influence the {{adoption of}} <b>decentralised</b> wastewater <b>management</b> in Harare. Water in the Harare metropolitan area is a very serious problem and this may constrain the effective implementation of decentralised systems. Alternative sources of water have to be explored such as rain harvesting. For the effective adoption of <b>decentralised</b> wastewater <b>management</b> strategies, new institutional structures will be required. Cases reviewed from Latin, Central and South America confirms that community engagement is critical factor in the success of the adoption of decentralized wastewater treatment systems. It is therefore important for the City of Harare to engage urban residents in the processes of adopting decentralized wastewater treatment systems. Public awareness is also important so that members of the public are educated on the benefits of implementing such systems in their community.|$|R
30|$|Harare can adopt various {{strategies}} {{in relation to}} the <b>decentralised</b> wastewater <b>management</b> concept. From the foregoing it emerges that a number of strategies and technologies can be adopted for wastewater <b>management</b> in a <b>decentralised</b> framework, all effectively treating smaller quantities at or near the source. Septic tanks, pit-latrines and urine diversion are some of the strategies that are gaining popularity as <b>decentralised</b> wastewater <b>management</b> systems (De Gisi et al. 2014). There are also less concentrated wastewater and uses natural treatment methods like algae and duckweed based ponds and constructed wetlands, with harvesting of protein biomass. The other {{strategies in}}clude the use of maturation ponds and anaerobic pre-treatment to allow for stabilisation of organic matter. Algae-based systems are also being used for decentralised systems in Harare. This consists of four treatment lines of small algae-based waste stabilisation ponds scattered in the Mabvuku/Tafara high density area (Nhapi 2004 a, b, c). The decentralised or onsite handling of wastewater opens opportunities for simpler methods of wastewater treatment (especially natural methods) and encourages wastewater reuse closer to sources of generation. The adoption of <b>decentralised</b> wastewater <b>management</b> strategy as a sustainable wastewater management in Harare has to consider a number of limitations. First, Harare has an existing extensive infrastructure that has been operational for some years and which represents an enormous capital investment. Therefore, this cannot be phased out overnight and a gradual approach is required. Very few residential areas use communal water and sanitation facilities. Second, land use patterns in Harare exhibit vastly different characteristics so much that it would be irrational to adopt a single solution for all areas. Lifestyles and water use characteristics for low, medium and high-density residential areas are quite different. A differentiated approach is therefore required.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} Cameroon’s {{model of}} forest-management decentralisation by characterising its organisational infrastructure and by assessing – and anticipating – the ecological effects of those policy changes. The essay {{is based on}} nvironmental governance research conducted in Cameroon {{during the last three}} years. Five Community Forests, one Council Forest and nine forestry fee management committees were covered by the study. Methods of data collection included participant observation, analysis of historical trends, semi-structured interviews at the regional level, focus group meetings, historical transects of landscape and future scenarios. The first section describes the key reforms put in place by the new forest management regime, including the institutional and socio-organisational choices legally prescribed for outlying actors in the <b>decentralised</b> <b>management</b> of forests and their revenues. The mechanisms connecting these institutional and socio-organisational choices to implementation – that is, the management of Community Forests, Council Forests and forestry revenues – are examined {{in the second part of}} the essay. The third section assesses the social outcomes of these processes. Ecological risks and uncertainties due to the way <b>decentralised</b> <b>management</b> is conducted at both the local and the regional levels are addressed in the fourth section. The Cameroonian decentralisation model, already registered some positive infra-outcomes. After all, decentralisation is not mechanical. It is not only explainable by laws and institutional arrangements: its implementation depends on many variables. It requires sufficient time to develop due to the complexity of human and institutional behaviour and because of unpredictability, variability, contingency and change, as well as many other stimuli. In sum, it is a ‘story’ of adaptation, with successes and failures. Policy innovations and reforms are in themselves experiments and should not be perceived as victories or crises, but, instead, as arenas of ongoing lessons and progressive learning...|$|E
40|$|Focus of {{the study}} is the {{potential}} role of local institutions in fisheries management. As world-wide marine resources deteriorate, the call for better management urges national governments to <b>decentralise</b> <b>management</b> authority to local and lower government levels. Ownership and long-term access to resources are important incentives to manage resources for sustainability, while proximity to the resource, relevant local knowledge and local management institutions allow for effective and more equitable management that is both adaptive and resilient. Sasi in Maluku, Indonesia, is such an institution and has often been heralded as an example of successful local resource management. The extent to which it was still active and functional, however, was not known. This thesis contains an inventory of sasi and an analysis of its performance in terms of equity, efficiency, biological and social sustainability, and is illustrated by an elaborate description of sasi in Nolloth village. The study of sasi has been put in the wider context of decentralisation in Indonesia which is compared to the process in the Philippines. The results have also been used to identify the factors that enhance success of co-management in Southeast Asia. Finally a methodology is proposed to measure this success in an appropriate way.
