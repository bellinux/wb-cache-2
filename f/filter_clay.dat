The contaminated soil beneath the former pile is covered with an impermeable material to prevent the infiltration of water and to prevent human contact. EPA installed extraction wells and an oil/water treatment system to remove the floating oil layer from the ground water. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) is currently using these wells to continue the removal of floating oil. To date, NJDEP has removed over 20,000 gallons of PCB-contaminated oil. In 1998, EPA excavated and disposed of 6,488 cubic yards of contaminated soil (roughly equivalent to one football field, covered one yard deep) from four nearby residences. NJDEP completed a study determining the full {{nature and extent of}} the contamination.

One promising low-cost material for manufacturing porous ceramics as water <b>filter</b> is <b>clay.</b> Clays can be blended with other materials such as polymers to obtain functional ceramic materials. Approach: Ceramic wastewater filters were fabricated from clay using both sol-gel and simple mixing methods followed by hot-pressing and calcination. Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) was used as a pore-forming agent. Results: Varying the clay:PEG ratio modified the membrane permeability between 1. 65 Ã— 10 - 16 m 2 and 3. 16 Ã— 10 - 15 m 2 for the sol-gel membranes and between 1. 38 Ã— 10 - 16 and 8. 72 Ã— 10 - 13 m 2 for membranes prepared by simple mixing. The strength ranged from 0. 28 MPa- 1. 71 MPa for the sol-gel membranes and from 0. 05 - 0. 90 MPa for samples prepared by simple mixing.

40|$|The most usual {{method of}} {{preparing}} orientated clay specimens for X-ray analysis using a powder diffractometer, is to pipette a clay suspension onto a glass slide and {{allow it to}} dry. However, Gibbs (1965) and other workers have shown that this method plus several other preparation techniques, though reasonably precise, do lead to large inaccuracies in estimating the relative amounts of each clay mineral in a clay mixture. The principle cause of these inaccuracies i the segregation of the various clay minerals due to their different settling rates as they settle through an aqueous medium. The effect is particularly noticeable where montmorillonite is present with other clay minerals. Gibbs (1965) recommended that a smear mount or suction-onto-ceramic tile method should be used to produce well-orientated clay samples with minimal segregation effects.

40|$|Biofiltration is {{cost-effective}} for {{the treatment}} of gases containing low concentrations of volatile organic compounds (< 3 g m(- 3)). However, conventional biofilters, based on compost and bacterial activity, face problems with the elimination of hydrophobic compounds. Besides that, biofilter operational stability is often hampered by acidification and drying out of the filter bed. To overcome these problems, biofilters with fungi on inert packing material have been developed. Fungi are more resistant to acid and dry conditions than bacteria, and it is hypothesised that the aerial mycelia of fungi, which are in direct contact with the gas, can take up hydrophobic compounds faster than flat aqueous bacterial biofilm surfaces. Alpha-pinene was chosen as a model compound. It is an odorous compound emitted by the wood processing industry. In 21 biofilter columns four different packing materials were tested: perlite, expanded clay granules, polyurethane foam cubes and compost. The filters were inoculated with forest soil and ventilated with gas containing alpha-pinene. Start up took 1 - 2 months and removal efficiencies of more than 90 % were observed, but mostly ranged from 50 % to 90 % due to overloading. In the <b>filters</b> containing perlite, <b>clay,</b> polyurethane and compost volumetric removal capacities of, respectively, 24, 33, 38 and 24 g alpha-pinene m(- 3) filter bed h(- 1) were attained and the gas pressure drops in the 60 cm high filter beds measured at a superficial gas velocity of 35 m h(- 1) were 70, 550, 180 and 250 Pa. The results indicate {{that it is possible to}} develop biofilters based on the action of fungi with higher elimination capacities for alpha-pinene as reported in literature for bacterial biofilters. The use of polyurethane foam cubes is preferred because of the low gas pressure drop in combination with a high volumetric elimination capacity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Leachate has {{a number}} of {{environmental}} problems and it is characterized by high concentration of organic matter, nitrogen, heavy metals, and chlorinated organic and inorganic salts. Organic content of leachate is generally measured in terms of biological oxygen demand (BOD 5) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Higher concentrations of pollutants in leachate are the potential source of contamination of both ground and surface waters. Therefore, it necessitates the proper treatment of landfill leachate prior to discharge into natural water sinks. However, on-site "high-tech" treatment systems are unsustainable to low income countries due to large constructional and operational cost. Hence, there is a particular need for low-cost and low-maintenance leachate treatment systems. The main {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the efficiency of different cost effective methods to remove pollutants in leachate. A constructed wetland with an area of 16 m 2 planted with typhalatifoliawas used to assess its efficiency in removing pollutants. In addition, column study was conducted to evaluate efficiency of low- cost filter materials as a new method to treat leachate. Different mixtures of sand, clay and activated carbon were tested by loading columns with leachate.

40|$|Waterworks in Sweden {{that apply}} {{conventional}} chemical surface water treatment {{are facing a}} number of challenges, including changes in raw water quality and demands for improved particle removal. The chief objective of this work was to evaluate biological pre-filtration for typical Swedish surface water, regarding the removal of natural organic matter, particles, iron and manganese, and taste and odour compounds. Pilot-scale experimental work included the investigation of biofilters fed directly with surface water, using non-adsorptive expanded clay and partly exhausted granular activated carbon. Process combinations with conventional chemical treatment and nanofiltration were investigated. Biological pre-filtration decreased the load of particles and biodegradable organic matter to subsequent treatment processes. Peak loads of added particles were equalised by high initial retention followed by a slow release of attached particles. In chemical treatment with pre-filtration, the removal of Âµm-size particles became less dependent on the post-sedimentation rapid filters. The experimental study contributed with data on the microbial barrier function of chemical surface water treatment under Swedish conditions with regard to particle-, bacteria- and virus removal. Simple rapid media filtration pre-treatment of surface water caused fast pressure drop development in nanofilter membranes. Biofiltration moderated the increase in pressure drop in comparison to rapid filtration. Destructive analysis of the nanofiltration elements was performed to study the fouling layer on the membrane. Biological pre-filtration alleviated occasional episodes of dissolved manganese and odour compounds in humic surface waters, which are difficult to control by conventional chemical treatment alone. The mechanism of biological removal of two biogenic odour compounds (geosmin and MIB) was found to completely depend on metabolic activity on a non-adsorptive <b>filter</b> medium (expanded <b>clay).</b> Within the Sustainable Urban Water Management program, a systems analysis study was conducted.

The research and development process has consisted of analysis of alternative products in the global market, selection of designs, field research and proof of concept, selected products evaluation, and final design recommendations. Four HWTS products have been studied and analyzed thoroughly. The field research was done in January 2013 in Ghana, and included 40 household surveys and multiple field trips to a local water treatment plant, plastic manufacturers, and Ghana Water Co Ltd, the national piped water-supply agency in Accra. The products analyses and field research data are then synthesized in two products assessments and final recommendations are made.

40|$|We {{have been}} able to confirm the {{observations}} of Twort as well as of Gratia, that dead staphylococcus may undergo lysis if, in addition to a suitable bacteriophage, there is also present live staphylococcus. Moreover, we have endeavored to ascertain the mechanism of this phenomenon and have found that in order to elicit it it is necessary to control the numbers of live and dead bacteria in the mixture. An excess of dead bacteria interferes with lysis by adsorbing the bacteriophage before it has the opportunity to initiate necessary changes in the live bacteria, so that all lysis is prevented. The phenomenon is specific, that is, the lysis of live bacteria is accompanied by lysis of dead bacteria of the same species only. Lysis of dead bacteria occurs best with staphylococcus, an organism which easily undergoes spontaneous autolysis under appropriate conditions. In the case of B. coli or B. dysenteriÃ¦ the lysis of the dead bacteria is uncertain. Dead bacteria need not be present in the mixture {{at the beginning of the}} experiment; they will be dissolved if added any time before, during, or after the completion of lysis of live bacteria. If the test is performed so that a suitable semipermeable membrane is interposed between the dead and live bacteria, the dead bacteria are not dissolved, in spite of the lysis of live bacteria on the other side of the membrane. The agent determining the lysis of dead bacteria is not diffusible, while the principle initiating the lysis of live bacteria diffuses freely and is demonstrably present on both sides of the membrane. The complete independence of the agent causing dissolution of dead bacteria from bacteriophage can also be shown by separating the two agents by means of filtration, or by adsorption on bacteria. The ferment-like substance responsible for the lysis of dead bacteria is different from the bacteriophage. It is not diffusible through collodion, it is easily adsorbed on <b>clay</b> <b>filters,</b> it is heat-labile, and is inactivated on standing.

40|$|Pebble matrix {{filtration}} (PMF) is a {{water treatment}} technology that can remove suspended solids in highly turbid surface water during heavy storms. PMF typically uses sand and natural pebbles as <b>filter</b> media. Hand-made <b>clay</b> pebbles (balls) {{can be used}} as alternatives to natural pebbles in PMF treatment plants, where natural pebbles are not readily available. Since the high turbidity is a seasonal problem that occurs during heavy rains, the use of newly developed composite clay balls instead of pure clay balls have the advantage of removing other pollutants such as natural organic matter (NOM) during other times. Only the strength properties of composite clay balls are described here as the pollutant removal {{is beyond the scope of}} this paper. These new composite clay balls must be able to withstand dead and live loads under dry and saturated conditions in a filter assembly. Absence of a standard ball preparation process and expected strength properties of composite clay balls were the main reasons behind the present study. Five different raw materials from industry wastes: Red Mud (RM), Water Treatment Alum Sludge (S), Shredded Paper (SP), Saw Dust (SD), and Sugar Mulch (SM) were added to common clay brick mix (BM) in different proportions. In an effort to minimize costs, in this study clay balls were fired to 1100 0 C at a local brick factory together with their bricks. A comprehensive experimental program was performed to evaluate crushing strength of composite hand-made clay balls, using uniaxial compression test to establish the best material combination on the basis of strength properties for designing sustainable filter media for water treatment plants. Performance at both construction and operating stages were considered by analyzing both strength properties under fully dry conditions and strength degradation after saturation in a water bath. The BM- 75 % as the main component produced optimum combination in terms of workability and strength. With the material combination of BM- 75 % and additives- 25 %, the use of Red Mud and water treatment sludge as additives produced the highest and lowest strength of composite clay balls, with a failure load of 5. 4 kN and 1. 4 kN respectively. However, this lower value of 1. 4 kN is much higher than the effective load on each clay ball of 0. 04 kN in a typical filter assembly (safety factor of 35), therefore, can still be used as a suitable filter material for enhanced pollutant removal...|$|R
40|$|In South Africa, the {{ferrochromium}} industry produces approximately 100, 000 t {{bag house}} filter dust and slurry, while {{the stainless steel}} industry produces 24, 000 t of dust annually [17, 39]. The toxic substances in these wastes potentially {{pose a threat to}} the environment and human health, especially Cr (VI) due to its toxic, carcinogenic, highly soluble and strongly oxidizing properties. Therefore, the existence and treatment of wastes from stainless steel and ferrochrome production remain a challenge and an issue of concern. The increase of environmental legislation globally and the trend towards sustainable development are drives for alternatives to landfill. In the present thesis, the characteristics, formation mechanisms, leachability and stabilisation of the Cr (VI) -containing electric furnace dust and filter cake were investigated using various techniques such as XRD, XRF, TG/DTA, XPS, SEM-EDS, FT-IR, Raman spectrometer and UV/Vis spectrometer. The electric furnace dust and filter cake are very fine particles. Stainless steel dust forms by the entrainment of charge materials, evaporation or volatilisation of elements and ejection of slag and metal by spitting or the bursting of gas bubbles. It was found that ferrochrome dust is formed by the ejection of slag and metals droplets from the electrode hole, the entrainment of charge materials, vaporisation as well as the formation and precipitation of compounds from vaporised species in the off-gas duct. Filter cake contains crystal phases (CaF 2 and CaSO 4) and metal rich amorphous phases. It is formed due to super saturation and precipitation. Leaching experiments on the wastes showed that Cr (VI) rapidly leaches out by distilled water. Bricks were produced by mixing wastes (stainless steel plant dust, ferrochrome dust and <b>filter</b> cake) and <b>clay.</b> The optimum sinter parameter was found to be 1100 oC and 5 hours for a 50 wt% SPD- 50 wt% AS mixture in the brick. The leachability of Cr(VI) is strongly influenced by the mass%CaO/mass%SiO 2 ratio and alkali metal oxides content in the wastes. The emission factors from the stabilised wastes (SPD, FCD 1, FCD 2 and FC) are similar to those reported for the cement industry. Semi-dynamic leaching tests indicated that the predominant leaching mechanisms of chromium species are initial surface wash-off followed by matrix diffusion.

The evidence gathered from laboratory testing suggests that the subballast selection criteria adopted by the railway industry, which are based on mathematical and empirical models generated from static load conditions in embankment dams, does not address the filtration mechanism of subballasts under cyclic conditions. Apart from being a commonly used buffer for the ballast layer against subgrade attrition, subballast is primarily designed to act as a stress dissipation layer (capping layer) and its function as a filter is often regarded as a lesser priority. With more emphasis on the stress reduction function, well graded subballast containing larger particles provides a better skeletal resistance against applied stresses. However, well graded subballasts containing relatively coarse grains (20 % fine sand, 30 % fine gravel) are too porous to effectively Abstract vi capture the fines within its voids. Laboratory findings suggested that uniformly graded subballasts with not more than 30 % fine sands (particle range of 0. 15 to 0. 425 mm) had an enhanced filtering capacity. Due to the lack of mechanical resistance against axial deformation, the application of cyclic stress to uniformly graded subballasts reduces porosity and enables the filter to trap migrating fines more effectively. Moreover, this intrusion of fines changes the PSD of the subballast which reduces its porosity and further inhibits drainage. A multi-layer mathematical approach was used to predict the time dependent permeability of this filter, with (a) a reduction in porosity as a function of compression under cyclic loading, and (b) the amount of fines trapped within the filter voids, being the two main aspects of this proposed model. Laboratory test results conducted on a novel cyclic loading permeameter were used to validate the proposed model. The set of equations that forms an integral part of the proposed model is then presented as compact visual guidelines anticipated to provide a more practical tool for railway practitioners...|$|R
