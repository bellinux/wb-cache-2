40|$|Over {{the past}} three centuries {{there has been a}} rapid {{accumulation}} of physiological capital in OECD countries. Enhanced physiological capital is tied to long-term reduction in environmental hazards and to the conquest of chronic malnutrition. Data on heights and birth weights suggests that physiological capital has become more equally distributed, thereby reducing socioeconomic disparities in the burden of disease. Implications for health care policy are: (1) enhanced physiological capital has done more to reduce inequities in health status than <b>has</b> <b>wider</b> <b>access</b> to health care; (2) the main contribution of more advanced medical treatment so far has been to retard depreciation in individuals' physiological capital; (3) prenatal and early childhood care and environmental issues are key for interventions aimed at enhancing physiological capital and at affecting its rate of depreciation; (4) lifestyle change is the most important issue affecting health equity in rich countries; and (5) greater access to clinical care should be promoted through aggressive outreach, since expanded insurance coverage by itself is inadequate. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{financing}} constraints on employment decisions of firms, when {{it is possible to}} choose between permanent and fixed-term workers. We use linked employer-employee data for the universe of private sector firms in Portugal, and the 2008 - 09 financial crisis as a shock for identification. We find that firms in sectors that intrinsically rely more on external finance increased the share of fixed-term employment and hires after the crisis, while the effect for firms with <b>wider</b> <b>access</b> to buyer-supplier credit is relatively lower. At the worker level, workers in sectors that require significant external financing {{are more likely to be}} hired with a fixed-term contract after the crisis, while those in sectors that <b>have</b> <b>wider</b> <b>access</b> to supplier credit are less likely. Our results suggest that the crisis induced financially constrained firms to use the more flexible fixed-term contracts more intensively.

40|$|Many {{municipal}} water-supply {{systems in}} the United States face serious problems associated with capital deterioration, deferred maintenance, unreliable water supply, and underpricing of services. In addition, local governments are projected to fall $ 17 billion short of the estimated $ 49 billion cost (1993 – 2000) {{to comply with the}} Safe Water Drinking Act amendments. Because municipal water-supply systems, frequently publicly owned and operated, face little capital-market competition and generally cannot go bankrupt, they lack incentives to operate efficiently. Private systems also face operational and management problems as a result of rate-of-return regulation and unequal tax treatment with publicly owned systems. Rate regulation removes incentives to innovate and adopt least-cost practices. In addition, in contrast to municipally owned systems, privately owned systems pay taxes, do not <b>have</b> <b>wide</b> <b>access</b> to tax-exempt funds, and thus operate at a considerable competitive disadvantage.

However, since the current copyright law system subtly favors copyright holders, {{it is time to}} re-evaluate copyright law to ensure it meets its original purpose of promoting the learning of the society. The research primarily focuses on how to broaden copyright limitations and exceptions for the public to access and use learning materials. Within the framework of the copyright law system, other mechanisms that allow users to access copyrighted materials at a reasonable price also are considered. Such mechanisms include an efficient collective copyright management system and various licensing schemes. In an information network environment, it is time for developing countries to reform copyright law in order to promote education and research.

In addition to trading, many of the flowers and herbs used in perfumery were cultivated by the Muslims — rose and jasmine were native to the region, and many other plants (i.e.: bitter orange and other citrus trees, all of which imported from China and southeast Asia) could be successfully cultivated in the Middle East, and are to this day key ingredients in perfumery.|$|R
40|$|The {{bank lending}} channel theory posits that during {{monetary}} contractions banks restrict some firms' loans, thus reducing their desired investment independently of interest rates. Previous research finds small firms reduce, while large firms accelerate, loan growth. We find that small firms increase trade credit, a substitute credit, indicating a strong loan demand. It supports the bank lending channel: {{they do not}} voluntarily cut bank loans since they increase a less-desirable alternative. Using trade credit is propitious since unlike commercial paper (investigated by previous researchers), it is widely used by the small firms suffering the loan decline. Surprisingly, we also find large firms increase trade credit, a puzzle since they are typically assumed to <b>have</b> <b>wide</b> <b>access</b> to other credit. Using individual firm data, we find the reasons large firms use trade credit are financial in nature: those without a bond rating increase trade credit (i. e. without access to open market credit). As relatively few firms have this mark of quality, it implies that more firms are affected by credit constraints than previously believed...|$|R

The consequences of security incidents include economic losses for industries, but in case of terror attacks may also affect society in general. If transport networks are not adequately protected, consumable products (e. g. food, pharmaceuticals) could be counterfeited or contaminated and smuggled into a country, giving rise to death or diseases. Today, to enhance {{the protection}} of transport networks, companies <b>have</b> <b>wide</b> <b>access</b> to handbooks, advanced security technologies or certification programs (e. g.

40|$|Aim: After ten year, the Italian law on {{medically}} {{assisted reproduction}} {{has been almost}} completely demolished. The law was widely criticized and {{right from the start}} it came under attack from Italian judges who proceeded, through the issue of about twenty sentences, to dismantle it piece by piece. Restrictions imposed by Law 40 / 2004 drove many infertile Italian couples to choose to go abroad so as to <b>have</b> <b>wider</b> <b>access</b> to assisted procreative treatments. Methods: In 2009 the Constitutional Court declared that the maximum limit of three embryos, and the obligation to implant all three produced, was constitutionally illegitimate; finally, in 2014, the Constitutional Court (no. 162 / 2014) declared the ban on donor insemination unconstitutional, thus opening the way to heterologous assisted reproduction. Results: However, the Italian legislator must tackle several issues relating to heterologous MAR techniques, such as number of donationsm, adoption of an open-identity system versus an anonymous system, criteria for accessing therapy, withdrawal of consent to MAR procedures and the use of embryos for scientific research. Conclusion: On these topics and on the emission of ministerial guidelines will depend the future of those Italian couples who are sterile, infertile or unable to reproduce responsibly, and who are still waiting to exercise their rights; restoring to physicians their right to independent and responsible decision-making within their own sphere of competence and autonomy. </br...|$|R

The social stigmatisation of involuntarily childless women in Sub-Saharan Africa has been widely documented in the social science literature. This body of literature on the gendered meaning of infertility {{and its impact on}} involuntary childless women has helped to change attitudes and perspectives on involuntary childlessness in the international public health framework. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recently designated infertility as a global public health concern and <b>has</b> canvassed for <b>wider</b> <b>access</b> to assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) in the developing world.

A country can be seen as holding a central position in global trade {{to the extent that it}} is involved in a large number of economic transactions with alternative potential suppliers and <b>has</b> a <b>wide</b> <b>access</b> to different important markets. However, the centrality of countries’ positions in the international production {{of goods and services}} may vary according to the specific stages of the production process that countries occupy. Here we adopt a network-based perspective, and propose a novel three-faceted measure of centrality that captures countries’ distinct roles at the upstream, midstream, and downstream stages of the international production process. Findings suggest that rankings of countries based on our measures of centrality vary across production stages. While emerging and developing countries tend to secure central positions at upstream and midstream production stages, high-income countries tend to exert prevailing roles at downstream stages. Moreover, rankings based on our measures differ from alternative rankings obtained from traditional measures of market power simply reflecting aggregate trade values. This is especially the case within more traditional industries, such as Textiles and Apparel, in which small and less developed countries can play relevant roles at various stages of the production process.|$|R
