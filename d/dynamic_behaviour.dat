40|$|Chaos {{provides}} many interesting {{properties that}} can be used to achieve computational tasks. Such properties are sensitivity to initial conditions, space filling, control and synchronization. Chaotic neural models have been devised to exploit such properties. In this paper, a chaotic spiking neuron model is investigated experimentally. This investigation is performed to understand the <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviours</b> of the model. The aim of this research is to investigate the dynamics of the nonlinear dynamic state neuron (NDS) experimentally. The experimental approach has revealed some quantitative and qualitative properties of the NDS model such as the control mechanism, the reset mechanism, and the way the model may exhibit <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviours</b> in phase space. It is shown experimentally in this paper that both the reset mechanism and the self-feed back control mechanism are important for the NDS model to work and to stabilise to one of the large number of available unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) that are embedded in its attractor. The experimental investigation suggests that the internal dynamics of the NDS neuron provide a rich set of <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviours</b> {{that can be}} controlled and stabilised. These wide range of <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviours</b> may be exploited to carry out information processing tasks...|$|R

40|$|Field {{measurements}} {{were carried out}} to evaluate dynamic loads on an existing skew box girder continuous bridge. This paper presents the experimental procedure, the data acquisition system, the calibration test, the modal analysis and the load distribution in a transversal direction. A three-axle heavy truck was hired {{for use in the}} test to calibrate the field measurements. The static and dynamic bending moments of the tested bridge induced by the calibration truck were obtained. The relationship between the measured strain and bending moment were determined. Information on the <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviours</b> of the bridge were obtained from an experimental and theoretical modal analysis. The influence of skewness on the static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviours</b> of the bridge {{as well as on the}} load distribution in the transversal direction for the calibration truck and in-service vehicles was investigated. It was found that the influence of skew in both the static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviours</b> of the bridge within the skew angle range of 0 degrees- 30 degrees is very small...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} approximate the forward and inverse <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviours</b> of a magneto-rheological (MR) damper using evolving radial basis function (RBF) networks. Due to the highly nonlinear characteristics of MR dampers, modelling of MR dampers becomes a very important problem to their applications. In this paper, an alternative representation of the MR damper in terms of evolving RBF networks, which have a structure of four input neurons and one output neuron to emulate the forward and inverse <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviours</b> of an MR damper, respectively, is developed by combining the genetic algorithms (GAs) {{to search for the}} network centres with other standard learning algorithms. Training and validating of the evolving RBF network models are achieved by using the data generated from the numerical simulation of the nonlinear differential equations proposed for the MR damper. It is shown by the validation tests that the evolving RBF networks can represent both forward and inverse <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviours</b> of the MR damper satisfactorily. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} an {{induction}} motor identification in all states and conditions whether transient or steady using Elman neural network. Induction motors have highly nonlinear <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviours</b> where the parameters vary {{with time and}} operating conditions. These nonlinear <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviours</b> make difficult the identification of induction motor. While many applications such as control [1] need an accurate identification of induction motor, therefore having an appropriate identification seems to be necessary. Here a recurrent neural network introduced by Elman [2] which has the ability of learning temporal patterns as well as spatial ones is employed for induction motor identification. Our experiments show that using Elman recurrent neural network for identification could achieve high degree of accuracy in all states and conditions...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{dominant}} properties of a global computing network is the incomplete information available to principals about each other. This was the motivation of using the notion of probabilistic trust as an approach to security sensitive decision making in modern open and global computing systems. In such systems any principal A uses the outcomes of past interactions with another principal B to construct a probabilistic model approximating the behaviour of B. Using this model, the principal A can take decisions regarding interactions with B by estimating its future actions. Many existing frameworks adopt the so-called ‘Beta model’. The main limitation of these frameworks is that they assume the behaviour of any principal to be fixed, which is not realistic in many cases. In this thesis, we first address the application of probabilistic trust to optimise security protocols, and specifically give an example where the Crowds anonymity protocol is extended to use trust information. We then {{address the problem of}} evaluating probabilistic trust in principals exhibiting <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviours.</b> In this respect, we formally analyse the ‘exponential decay’ technique as an approach to coping with principals’ <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Given the identified limitations of this technique, a more general framework for trust and reputation is introduced. In this framework, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are used for modelling the <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviours</b> of principals. This framework is formally analysed in terms of a notion of ‘estimation error’. Using an experimental approach based on Monte-Carlo methods to evaluate the expected estimation error, the introduced HMM-based framework for trust and reputation is compared to the existing Beta framework. The results show in general that the latter is getting more promising in evaluating trust in principals (‘trustees’) having <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviours</b> as longer sequences of observations are available about such trustee...|$|R

40|$|Defects cause faulty static logic <b>behaviour,</b> faulty <b>dynamic</b> logic <b>behaviour</b> and {{elevated}} I DDQ levels. Recent empirical and simulation {{studies show that}} adding at speed tests to test suites detects defective ICs missed by slow speed and I DDQ tests. Delay tests for path delay faults and transition tests are two classes of tests that are often used for isolating ICs with faulty <b>dynamic</b> logic <b>behaviour.</b> We show that both these classes of tests often fail to detect many defects that causes faulty <b>dynamic</b> faulty <b>behaviour.</b> This implies that computing at speed tests is fundamentally different from computing delay tests for parametric testing and new techniques need to be developed. 1 Introduction The objective of production testing is to detect manufacturing defects.

40|$|Motivation: Dynamic {{simulation}} of genome-scale molecular interaction networks {{will enable the}} mechanistic prediction of genotype–phenotype relationships. Despite advances in quantitative biology, full parameterization of whole-cell models is not yet possible. Simulation methods capable of using available qualitative data are required to develop dynamic whole-cell models through an iterative process of modelling and experimental validation. Results: We formulate quasi-steady state Petri nets (QSSPN), a novel method integrating Petri nets and constraint-based analysis to predict the feasibility of qualitative <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviours</b> in qualitative models of gene regulation, signalling and whole-cell metabolism. We present the first dynamic simulations including regulatory mechanisms and a genome-scale metabolic network in human cell, using bile acid homeostasis in human hepatocytes as a case study. QSSPN simulations reproduce experimentally determined qualitative <b>dynamic</b> <b>behaviours</b> and permit mechanistic analysis of genotype–phenotype relationships.
