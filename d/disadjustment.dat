Identifying a set of common problems is not difficult: the Luda’s; the <b>disadjustment</b> between people and goods mobility, the difficult articulation between space and development sustainability the fragile features of the urban space in its complexity, the responsible social management of current migrations etc...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at testing a {{proposal}} relating contextual and emotional factors to prosocial and problematicbehaviors in adolescence. This proposal is based on ecological contextual models dealing with the influence ofmultiple factors on the explanation of psychological phenomena. The study was done on a sample of 239 nuclearfamilies {{with at least one}} son aged between 12 and 18 years old. The results showed that the main predictor ofprosocial behavior is the emotional factor, whereas for the psychological <b>disadjustment</b> behavior it is a proximal factor. It was also found that sympathy mediates both the relation between inductive discipline and the prosocial behavior,and the relation between acceptance and this adjustment behavior in adolescence...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Nursing in the {{intensive}} care unit requires knowledge, skill, experience and attitude. Due to the high sensitivity of intensive care units and that consideration for the standards can improve the quality of nursing care and safety of patient, the purpose of this study was to determine the performance score of the ICU nurses in teaching hospitals of Yazd and its Adjusting with the standard. Methods: In this cross-sectional descriptive study, performance of 74 nurses working in ICUs in teaching Hospitals, Yazd, Iran, was observed in three fields of Suctioning, Gavag and Extubation via using a checklist. Descriptive and inferential statistical procedures as well as SPSS software (version 16) were used for data analysis. Results: The results showed that the mean score for nursing performance in suction, gavage and extubation was 13. 76 (± 1 / 86), 16. 16 (± 1 / 20) and 11. 54 (± 1 / 38) respectively. Mean score of suction and gavage (P= 0) and extubation (P= 0 / 05) was significantly lower than the standard score. In the field of suction and gavage, the highest percentage of nonconcurrence with standard was related to hand washing 90. 5 % and 79. 7 % respectively. In the field of extubation, the highest percentage of <b>disadjustment</b> with standard, was related to the relationship with the patient that was 40. 5 %. Conclusion: According to the study findings, <b>disadjustment</b> of nurses' performance with standards in suction, gavage and extubation suggest that hospital leaders should act for scientific and practical training of nurses in the mentioned grounds. Furthermore, appropriate knowledge, skill, experience and ability should be regarded for applying nurses in ICUs...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the social classes, their characteristic elements and their spatial distribution in the Mexican agrarian field, based in the different layers that form them, and that have specific functions within the production relations. The social classes here considered, determine the mechanism of appropiation of unearned increment generated by the subordinate layers. These explotation and appropriation systems have through the times, an evolution which characterizes them depending of the historical moment, and in accordance with the prevailing production ways. In this study, it is considered that the present problem of the social classes should be placed in the theoretical frame that distinguishes the degree of development of capitalism in the Mexican agriculture, because it in turn determines the degree of <b>disadjustment</b> of the traditional rural people in the capitalist society...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo desta pesquisa foi verificar os efeitos da combinação de gessos de inclusão na adaptação das bases de prótese total {{superior}}, confeccionadas com resina acrílica ativada termicamente, polimerizadas de acordo com os seguintes ciclos: convencional, calor seco e energia de microondas. Foram confeccionados quarenta e cinco modelos padrões em gesso pedra, a partir de um molde de borracha representando uma arcada superior desdentada. Sobre os modelos foram confeccionadas quarenta e cinco bases de prova, divididas aleatoriamente em três grupos de quinze elementos cada, baseados no tipo do gesso utilizado durante a fase de inclusão dos modelos. No Grupo l, as bases de prova foram incluídas em mufla pela técnica convencional, utilizando-se gesso comum e pedra. No Grupo lI, utilizando-se gesso comum e especial, e no Grupo III, gesso pedra e especial. Cada Grupo foi subdividido em três subgrupos, de acordo com o ciclo de polimerização ao qual as amostras foram submetidas: Subgrupo 1 : polimerização através do ciclo convencional (74 + 2 °C por 9 horas); Subgrupo 2 : polimerização por calor seco (74 + 2 °C por 9 horas); e Subgrupo 3 : polimerização através de energia de microondas (900 W por 3 minutos). A seguir, as bases em resina foram fixadas em seus respectivos modelos com adesivo instantâneo. O conjunto base de prótese-modelo de gesso foi posicionado, fixado e seccionado em aparelho específico onde foram executados três cortes látero-Iaterais: A (anterior), B (médio) e C (posterior). A alteração dimensional ocorrida na resina acrílica foi avaliada por meio de um microscópio comparador, em cinco pontos referenciais. Os resultados numéricos foram submetidos à análise de 1 variância e ao teste de Tukey (5 %). Concluiu-se que, independente dos demais fatores, o ciclo convencional mostrou o maior desajuste das bases de prótese em relação aos modelos. Quando o tipo de inclusão foi analisado em relação ao fator ciclo de polimerização, verificamos que as inclusões Comum/Especial e Pedra/Especial não apresentaram valores com diferença estatística significativa. Na inclusão Comum/Pedra o ciclo convencional apresentou o maior desajuste. Quando o fator corte foi analisado em função do ciclo de polimerização, notamos que no corte A, o ciclo convencional apresentou o maior desajuste. Quando os cortes foram analisados independente de outros fatores, houve diferença estatística significativa entre eles. O maior desajuste ocorreu no corte C. Quando os cortes foram analisados em relação ao tipo de inclusão independente de outros fatores, verificamos que nas inclusões Comum/Especial e Pedra/Especial, o maior desajuste ocorreu no corte C. Quando o tipo de inclusão foi observado independente de outros fatores, verificamos que a inclusão Comum/Pedra apresentou o menor desajustehe {{purpose of}} this study was to verify the effects of the combination of inclusion plaster in the adaptation of upper denture bases, made with heat-cured acrylic resin, ocurred under the influence of three cycles of polymerization: conventional, by dry heat and with microwave energy. Forty-five master casts were made in stone plaster from a rubber cast representing upper nondental arch. The forty-five experimental bases were made on the casts which were divided at randon into three groups of fifteen elements, based on the kind of plaster used during the inclusion phase of the casts. The casts with the experimental bases from Group I were included in flask by conventional technique, using commum plaster and stone. In the Group II, using commum plaster and special, and the Group II stone plaster and special. Each group was subdivided into three subgroups, according the polymerization cycle to which the casts were submitted: Subgroup 1 : polymerization through the conventional cycle (74 + 2 °e for nine hours). Subgroup 2 : polymerization by dry heat (74 + 2 ° e for nine hours) and Subgroup 3 : polymerization in Microwave Oven (900 W for 3 minutes). Next, the bases in resin were fixed on their casts with instantaneous adhesive. The plaster model - prosthesis bases set was positined, fixed and cut on an especific instrument, three lateral plane cuts were made: A (anterior), B (median) and e (posterior). The occurred dimensional alteration on the acrylic resin was evaluated with a comparator microscope in five referential points. The numerical results were submitted to a variance analysis and the Tukey Test (5 %). It was concluded that, independent of other factors, the conventional cycle showed the biggest <b>disadjustment</b> of the denture bases in relation to the casts. When the kind of inclusion was analysed in relation to the cycle fa cto r of polymerization, it was verified that the Commum/Special and Stone/Special inclusions did not show statistic significative difference. In the Commum/Stone inclusion the conventional cycle showed the biggest <b>disadjustment.</b> When the cut factor was analysed in relation to the polymerization cycle, it was verified that in the A cut, the conventional cycle showed the biggest <b>disadjustment.</b> When the cuts were analysed independent of other factors, there was significative statistic difference among them. The biggest <b>disadjustment</b> occurred in the C cut. When the cuts were analysed in relation to the kind of inclusion independent of other factors, it was verified that in the Commum/Special and Stone/Special inclusions, the biggest <b>disadjustment</b> occurred in the C cut. When the kind of inclusion was analysed independent of other factors, it was verified that the Commum/Stone inclusion showed the smallest disadjustmen...|$|E

Fair sites embody specific forms of economic transfer and exchange that anticipate dreams of the borderless flows of capital in some current versions of globalization theory. This “sfnal” condition of the world’s-fair site is {{not just in the}} futuristic displays of techno-scientific “progress,” which became an insistent form of spectacle in the world’s fair, but also in the spatialization of developmental histories, reading conceptions of modernity remorselessly through hierarchies of racial “progress” or spectacles of anachronistic “arrest” or degenerative “decline. ” Long before the famous Futurama of 1939 New York, world’s fairs were one of the first spaces in which large populations experienced deliberate and sustained <b>disadjustment</b> in time within a bounded zone, an early sense of immersion in the “science-fictional. ...|$|E
40|$|Background. The {{main goal}} of {{treatment}} {{in patients with}} prostate cancer (PC) {{is not only to}} achieve the maximum survival, but also to assure the high quality of life (QL). By taking into account the fact there are no specialized Russian adapted questionnaires to assess QL in PC, the authors have developed a test system to evaluate the specific changes in the QL of patients, which occurred before and during treatment of this disease. Materials and methods. The «universal quality of life questionnaire for patients with prostate cancer» comprises 4 scales (sections) : «Urination», «Intestinal function», «Sexual function», «Hormonal function». Each section includes subscales (subsections) which concretize the degree of dysfunction of the above systems and ascertain how these changes influence patients' social life. Unified variants of answers that provide a rather objective assessment of the degree of dysfunction of the above systems of an organism are given to all questions.  The authors examined 235 patients treated for PC at the Clinic of Urology, Military Medical Academy, of them 182 males had underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) and 60 had received maximum androgenic blockade (surgical or medical). The validity of the questionnaire was assessed, by evaluating resistance and internal consistency. Results. After various medical measures, QL in patients with PC became worse due to impaired urination, and sexual and hormonal dysfunctions. After RRP, the major impairments were urinary incontinence lowering their social <b>disadjustment,</b> as well as related troubles. The men who have undergone antiandrogenic deprivation suffer mainly from dysuria.  The Pearson's correlation coefficient was 0. 7, which signifies its high reliability. To estimate validity, the authors calculated the Crohnbach coefficient that was > 0. 8, which is indicative of the high validity of the test. Conclusion. The questionnaire presented by the authors is a reliable tool in assessing the QL in patients with PC and may be recommended for its wide use by oncourological specialists in clinical practice and researches in the out- and inpatient settings.   </p...|$|E
