40|$|Abstract—The {{separation}} of variables method {{along with an}} addition theorem of Mathieu functions are employed in this paper to analyze the problem of a nonconfocal suspended strip in an <b>elliptical</b> <b>waveguide.</b> An infinite-dimensional determinant is obtained, which represents the characteristic equation of the proposed structure. To obtain the cutoff wavenumbers for both TE and TM cases of such a structure, the infinite determinant is truncated. Convergence when truncating was observed. Numerical results for the special case of a confocal structure is discussed first for comparison with published data. Results of other interesting cases are also presented...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{analysis}} of the resonance frequency for a Half-Mode Substrate-Integrated Waveguide (HMSIW) cavity realized with circular segments is presented. The analysis is based on the perturbation method applied on an <b>elliptical</b> <b>waveguide</b> using Mathieu functions. The results show an excellent agreement between simulation and analysis for an ideal model of HMSIW where the open aperture is approximated as perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) wall. To enhance the method applicability to a practical HMSIW, a well-known empirical formula for the HMSIW effective width is utilized, which yields a good prediction on the resonance frequency for this type of cavity antenna. The presented analysis further demonstrates the application of the perturbation method on waveguides with arbitrary shapes. Nghia Nguyen-Trong, Thomas Kaufmann, and Christophe Fumeau...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} study of the {{electromagnetic}} optical wave propagation in elliptical structure with helical winding at different pitch angle. The elliptical coordinate system is used. The characteristic dispersion equation is obtained. By using of Mathieu and modified Mathieu functions. It is found that the dispersion curves are of the expected shapes. From these curves the number of sustained modes can be obtained for known values of the size parameter, the operating frequency, and the core cladding refractive index. If the circular waveguide is given a transverse compression at the extremities of the major axis, the distortion may be represented by <b>elliptical</b> <b>waveguide.</b> The purpose of the present communication is to obtain the characteristic dispersion equation for elliptical structure with helical windings.

40|$|Electron {{temperature}} profiles at densities {{above the}} electron cyclotron emission (ECE) cutoff are {{measured at the}} W 7 -AS stellarator by a novel diagnostic based on black body emission and Bernstein-extraordinary-ordinary mode conversion of electron Bernstein waves (EBWs). The radiation is collected along a special oblique line of sight by an antenna with gaussian optics. This was optimized for maximal conversion efficiency and minimal Doppler broadening by means of EBW ray tracing calculations in full stellarator geometry. The elliptical O-mode polarization detected along the oblique line of sight is changed into a linear polarization by a broadband quarter wave shifter, namely an <b>elliptical</b> <b>waveguide.</b> The signal is spectrum analyzed by an heterodyne radiometer and temperature profiles are derived from spectra by means of ray tracing. The diagnostic was applied to measurements of edge-localized modes to illustrate its advantages in terms of spatial and temporal resolution. Moreover, for the first time, the heat wave propagation method for the determination of local heat transport coefficients was extended beyond the ECE cutoff density by combining EBW emission measurements at the first harmonic (f = 66 – 78 GHz) with modulated EBW heating at the second harmonic (140 GHz) ...|$|E
40|$|The cutoff {{wavelengths}} lambda(cmn) of elliptical metallic waveguides with perfectly conducting {{walls are}} determined analytically. Two different methods {{are used for}} the evaluation. In the first, the electromagnetic field is {{expressed in terms of}} elliptical-cylindrical wave functions. In the second, a shape perturbation method, the field is expressed in terms of circular-cylindrical wave functions only, while the equation of the elliptical boundary is given in polar coordinates. Analytical expressions are obtained for the cutoff wavelengths, when the solution is specialized to small values of the eccentricity h = c/ 2 a, (h << 1), with c the interfocal distance of the <b>elliptical</b> <b>waveguide</b> and 2 a the length of its major axis. In this case, exact closed-form algebraic expressions, free of Mathieu as well as of Bessel functions, are obtained for the expansion coefficients g(mn) ((2)) and g(mn) ((4)) in the resulting relation lambda(cmn) (h) = lambda(cmn) (0) [1 + g(mn) ((2)) h(2) + g(mn) ((4)) h(4) + O (h(6)) ] for the cutoff wavelengths.

40|$|The {{properties}} of an elliptical microwave applicator are investigated. The investigation includes the analytical {{solution of the}} cutoff frequencies and electromagnetic field patterns in <b>elliptical</b> <b>waveguides.</b> This requires the solution of Mathieu Functions and becoming familiar with an orthogonal elliptical coordinate system.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{accurate}} and efficient modal analysis of arbitrarily shaped waveguides whose cross section is defined {{by a combination of}} straight, circular, and/or elliptical arcs. A novel technique for considering the presence of circular and/or elliptical segments within the frame of the well-known boundary integral-resonant mode expansion (BI-RME) method is proposed. This new extended BI-RME method will allow a more accurate solution of a wider number of hollow conducting waveguides with arbitrary profiles, which are usually present in most modern passive waveguide components. To show the advantages of this new extended technique, the modal chart of canonical (circular and <b>elliptical)</b> <b>waveguides,</b> as well as of irises with great practical interest (i. e., cross-shaped irises with rounded corners) has been first successfully solved. Next, a computer-aided-design software package based on such a novel modal analysis tool has first been validated with the accurate analysis of a referenced complex dual-mode filter, and then applied to the complete design of a novel twist component for K-band application based on circular and <b>elliptical</b> <b>waveguides.</b> A prototype of this novel device has been manufactured and measured for verification purposes.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} a novel technique {{for the very}} efficient and accurate full-wave modal analysis of cylindrical waveguides with arbitrary cross-section. This new technique relies on solving the integral equations that provide the well-known Boundary Integral- Resonant Mode Expansion (BI-RME) method by the Nyström approach, instead of using the traditional Galerkin version of the Method of Moments (MoM), thus providing large savings on computational costs. Accuracy aspects of this simple and fast procedure, which are directly connected to the rigorous treatment of the singular behaviour of the integral equation kernels, are carefully considered for waveguides defined by straight, circular and/or elliptical arcs. Comparative benchmarks between the new technique and the original BI-RME method are successfully presented for single- and multi-ridged <b>waveguides,</b> <b>elliptical</b> <b>waveguides</b> and rectangular waveguides with rounded corners.

40|$|Abstract—A full-vectorial finite-difference scheme {{utilizing}} the hexagonal Yee’s cell {{is used in}} this paper to analyze the modes of photonic-bandgap fibers with symmetry. Because it respects the fiber’s native symmetry, this method is free from any numerical birefringence. We also incorporate in it techniques for reducing the memory requirement (up to 3 to 4 times) and computational time, in particular by exploiting some of the symmetry proper-ties of these fibers. Using sub-pixel averaging, we demonstrate quadratic convergence for the fundamental mode’s effective index dependence on spatial resolution. We show that this method {{can be used to}} calculate the beat length of PBFs in which a birefringence is introduced by applying a small unidirectional stretch to the fiber cross section along one of its axes. Abrupt variations of the modeled fiber geometries with spatial resolution lead to oscillatory beat length convergence behavior. We can obtain a better estimate for beat length by averaging these oscillations. We apply a strong perturbation analysis to the fiber’s unperturbed mode, calculated by our finite-difference method, to perform this averaging in a rigorous way. By fitting a polynomial to the predicted beat lengths as a function of grid spacing, we obtain an accurate estimate of the beat length at zero grid spacing. Reasonable convergence for the beat length is observed using a single processor with 8 GB of memory.
