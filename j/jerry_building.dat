50|$|<b>Jerry's</b> {{apartment}} <b>building</b> has new shower heads installed, {{but they}} are low-flow, and cause their hair to look bad. Jerry, Kramer, and Newman are all upset, and then look for other options. Newman receives a tip for black market Yugoslavian shower heads, so he takes Jerry and Kramer to his client's van. Kramer picks a high pressure shower head used for elephants, but it ends up being too powerful and it forces {{him out of the}} tub.|$|R

The light from the Kenny Rogers Roasters sign beams right into Kramer's apartment.

5000|$|Kramer {{has bought}} {{a hot tub}} and spends as much time in it as {{possible}} until one night he falls asleep in the tub and the power goes out, leaving him {{to spend the night}} in freezing cold water. As a result, his [...] "core temperature" [...] drops and he is constantly cold. While eating with Jerry, George and Kramer in the coffee shop Jean-Paul hears George's rampant swearing and believes all Americans speak this way. Later in Elaine's building he calls a baby [...] "bastard" [...] but it turns out the baby is illegitimate and the father has left. The landlord throws Jean-Paul out after Jean-Paul calls him a [...] "son of a bitch", forcing him to spend the night with Jerry. Jerry initially takes him to a hotel but soon believes he has offended the desk attendant after getting in an argument with him while attempting to place a wake-up call. Paranoid, Jerry insists they leave and brings an irritated Jean-Paul to his own apartment to sleep. Kramer meanwhile buys a powerful new heat pump to work his hot tub and raise his core temperature. Overnight the heat pump causes a power outage in <b>Jerry's</b> <b>building</b> and his alarm clocks fail to go off. Elaine spends the night looking for Jean-Paul (she is unaware he was thrown out) and her search for him in a dark, desolate neighborhood inspires her story for the Himalayan Walking Shoes.|$|R

Jerry tells him that if any blood gets into his apartment he will [...] "freak out".

5000|$|While conceiving a plotline for the third-season episode [...] "The Suicide", {{the writing}} staff {{decided to create}} a friend for Kramer. Though they never had the {{intention}} of having the Newman character return on the show, they felt {{it was easy to}} use him again, as he had already been introduced. Newman was initially envisioned as the son of the landlord who owned <b>Jerry</b> and Kramer's <b>building,</b> making him able to snitch about the building's inhabitants without being punished for it. However, in between drafts the writing staff decided to make Newman an inhabitant of the building and more of a nemesis to Jerry.|$|R

The manager takes this seriously and the busboy is fired that very night, upsetting Elaine and George. George and Kramer later go to the busboy's ramshackle apartment to apologize, only to accidentally leave the door open, letting his cat out. A few days later, the busboy comes to see George, and tells him that there was a gas line explosion at the restaurant, killing five employees, including the busboy hired to replace him. He thanks George for inadvertently saving his life and says he's found a better paying job anyway and also his escaped cat has come back to him.

Kramer hides his key again, this time in one of Jerry's shirt pockets. Jerry finds the key again when he puts on the shirt, in order to go down to let George in. While downstairs, a neighbor, Phil (Louis Mustillo), asks to be let in. Jerry politely denies him entry, explaining that there have been burglaries and he does not recognize him. Elaine goes to the mystery man's shabby apartment and discovers he is poor and on welfare. The woman he ran from is his welfare caseworker. Jerry discovers that Phil does in fact live in his building, and to add more discomfort to Jerry, he also lives right next door to Kramer.|$|R
5000|$|Sally gets a {{ride home}} with her boyfriend Jerry Sykes, in his car after school. They stop outside of a {{department}} store on the way, parking right outside the <b>building.</b> <b>Jerry</b> goes into the store and robs it, shooting the owner in the process.

Nick lets Jerry and Sally come into his club to hide from the police. Hanahan arrives on the scene looking for Jerry and Sally, but doesn't find them.

500|$|The season {{introduced}} several {{characters who}} returned {{later on the}} show. The episode [...] "The Pony Remark" [...] featured the second appearance of Helen and Morty Seinfeld, both of whom had previously appeared in the season 1 episode [...] "The Stake Out". In [...] "The Stakeout", Morty was portrayed by Phil Bruns; however, David and Seinfeld wanted the character to be harsher, and re-cast him with Barney Martin, who auditioned for the part on October 15, 1990 at 12:45pm. Martin was unaware that another actor had already established the part. Helen was portrayed by Liz Sheridan, who had played her in [...] "The Stake Out" [...] The same episode introduced Jerry's uncle Leo, portrayed by Len Lesser, who {{was known for his}} acting in gangster films such as The Outlaw Josey Wales and Kelly's Heroes. When Lesser auditioned for the part on October 22, 1990, he incited laughs from David, Seinfeld, and casting director Marc Hirschfeld, but did not understand why, because he did not think his lines were funny. Herschfield stated that when Lesser had auditioned {{it was clear that he}} was the right actor for the part. [...] "The Revenge" [...] features the first appearance by Newman (voiced by David), a suicidal man who lives in <b>Jerry's</b> apartment <b>building.</b> In [...] "The Revenge", Newman remained out of sight, although he appeared in a deleted scene. Before this scene was cut, William Thomas, Jr. had been cast for the part. Although the writing staff never intended for Newman to return to the show, the idea of having Wayne Knight as a neighbor appealed to them. Therefore, Knight was re-cast in the role of Newman for the season 3 episode [...] "The Suicide".|$|R
