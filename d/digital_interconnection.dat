50|$|The {{vision of}} the Physical Internet {{involves}} encapsulating goods in smart, ecofriendly and modular containers ranging from {{the size of a}} maritime container {{to the size of a}} small box. It thus generalizes the maritime container that succeeded to support globalization and shaped ships and ports, and extends containerization to logistics services in general. The Physical Internet moves the border of the private space to be inside of the container instead of the warehouse or the truck. These modular containers will be continuously monitored and routed, exploiting their <b>digital</b> <b>interconnection</b> through the Internet of Things.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{feasibility}} of using a new <b>digital</b> <b>interconnection</b> technology, the IEEE- 1394 High Performance Serial Bus, for audio and control data distribution in local and remote music recording studio environments. Current methods for connecting studio devices are described, {{and the need for}} a new <b>digital</b> <b>interconnection</b> technology explained. It is shown how this new interconnection technology and developing protocol standards make provision for multi-channel audio and control data distribution, routing, copyright protection, and device synchronisation. Feasibility is demonstrated by the implementation of a custom hardware and software solution. Remote music studio connectivity is considered, and the emerging standards and technologies for connecting future music studio utilising this new technology are discussed. ...|$|E

The required <b>digital</b> <b>interconnection</b> of machines and systems is time-consuming and costly, due to the variety of different interfaces and protocols. Within this work, we present a framework for a flexible and less complex integration of machines and devices into production networks and systems.

However, these tools {{do not take}} the VLSI circuit interconnection cost into account whereas this cost becomes predominant with the technology decrease and the application complexity increase. A new methodology that enables the interconnection cost to be controlled all along the architectural synthesis process is presented in this paper. First experimental results are presented.

40|$|In modern home {{entertainment}} video systems the <b>digital</b> <b>interconnection</b> {{between the different}} components is becoming increasingly common. However, analog signal sources are still in widespread use and must be supported by new devices. In order to keep costs down, the digital and the analog receiver chains are implemented on a single die to form a system-on-chip (SoC). For such integrated circuits, it is beneficial {{to reduce the number}} of power supply domains to a minimum and preferably use the core voltage to power the analog circuits. An eight-to-one input multiplexer, targeted for video digitizer applications, is presented. Together with the multiplexer, a simple current-mode DC restoration circuit is provided. The goal has been to design the circuits for a standard, single-well, 65 nm CMOS process, entirely using low-voltage core transistors and a single 1. 1 V supply domain, while allowing the input signal voltages to extend beyond the supply rails. To fulfill the requirements, a bootstrap technique has been proposed for the implementation of the multiplexer switches. Bootstrapping a CMOS switch allows high linearity, as well as wide bandwidth and dynamic range, to be achieved with a very low supply voltage. The simulated performance is: 3 dB bandwidth of 536 MHz with a 1. 5 pF load at the output of the multiplexer and a SFDR of 65 dBc at 20 MHz and 1 Vp-p input signal. It has been verified that no transistor is stressed by high voltages, therefore, the circuit reliability is guaranteed. The DC restoration circuit utilizes the main video ADC, for measuring the DC level, and is capable of setting it with an accuracy of 60 μV within the range of 100 mV to 500 mV...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} {{there is a limit to}} the total number of bits per second, B, of {{information}} that can flow in a simple <b>digital</b> electrical <b>interconnection</b> that is set only by the ratio of the length &quot; of the interconnection to the total cross-sectional dimension —A of the interconnect wiring — the “aspect ratio ” of the interconnection. This limit is largely independent of the details of the design of the electrical lines. The limit is approximately B ~ B o A/ &quot; 2 bits/s, with B o ~ 10 15 (bit/s) for highperformance strip lines and cables, ~ 10 16 for small on-chip lines, and ~ 10 17 - 10 18 for equalized lines. Because the limit is scale-invariant, neither growing or shrinking the size of the system substantially changes the limit. Exceeding this limit requires techniques such as repeatering, coding, and multilevel modulation. Such a limit will become a problem as machines approach Tb/s information bandwidths. The limit will particularly affect architectures in which one processor must talk reasonably directly with many others. We argue that optical interconnects can solve this problem since they avoid the resistive loss physics that gives this limit. 1...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{portable}} underwater {{acoustic modem}} is proposed {{in this paper}} for covert communication between divers or underwater unmanned vehicles (UUVs) and divers at a short distance. For the first time, real dolphin calls {{are used in the}} modem to realize biologically inspired Covert Underwater Acoustic Communication (CUAC). A variety of dolphin whistles and clicks stored in an SD card inside the modem helps to realize different biomimetic CUAC algorithms based on the specified covert scenario. In this paper, the information is conveyed during the time interval between dolphin clicks. TMS 320 C 6748 and TLV 320 AIC 3106 are the core processors used in our unique modem for fast <b>digital</b> processing and <b>interconnection</b> with other terminals or sensors. Simulation results show that the bit error rate (BER) of the CUAC algorithm is less than 10 − 5 when the signal to noise ratio is over ‒ 5 dB. The modem was tested in an underwater pool, and a data rate of 27. 1 bits per second at a distance of 10 m was achieved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—System-level design issues become {{critical}} as imple-mentation technology evolves toward {{increasingly complex}} inte-grated circuits and the time-to-market pressure continues relent-lessly. To cope with these issues, new methodologies that empha-size re-use {{at all levels}} of abstraction are a “must”, and this is a major focus of our work in the Gigascale Silicon Research Center. We present some important concepts for system design that are likely to provide {{at least some of the}} gains in productivity postu-lated above. In particular, we focus on a method that separates parts of the design process and makes them nearly independent so that complexity could be mastered. In this domain, architec-ture-function co-design and communication-based design are in-troduced and motivated. Platforms are essential elements of this design paradigm. We define system platforms and we argue about their use and relevance. Then we present an application of the design methodology to the design of wireless systems. Finally, we present a new approach to platform-based design called modern embedded systems, compilers, architectures and languages, based on highly concurrent and software-programmable architectures and associated design tools.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a self-timed scan-path architecture, {{to be used}} in a conventional synchronous environment, and with basic application in <b>digital</b> testing and <b>interconnections</b> checking in a Smart-Substrate MCM (T. A. García, A. J. Acosta, J. M. Mora, J. Ramos, and J. L. Huertas, “Self-Timed Boundary-Scan Cells for Multi- Chip Module Test,” Proceedings of IEEE VLSI Test Symposium, April 1998, pp. 92 – 97). With this approach, the potential advantages of self-timed asynchronous systems are explored for their practical use in a classical MCM testing application. Three different self-timed asynchronous boundary scan cells are proposed (Sense, Drive and Drive&Sense cells) that can be connected to form a self-timed scan-path. The main advantage is that no global test clock is needed, avoiding clock skew and synchronization faults in test mode, and hence, a more reliable test process is achieved. These cells have been designed and integrated in active substrates, building several boundary-scan configurations and being fully compatible with the ANSI/IEEE 1149. 1 Standard. The experimental results, as well as their comparison with their synchronous counterparts, show the feasibility of the proposed self-timed approach for testing interconnections in a MCM.
