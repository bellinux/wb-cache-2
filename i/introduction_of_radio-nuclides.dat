40|$|The Dutch {{national}} research programme into {{the feasibility of}} retrievable storage of radioactive waste (CORA Programme Phase I; CORA: Comité Opslag Radioactief Afval = Committee on Radioactive Waste Disposal) examined the suitability of Tertiary clay deposits for such storage. Long-term isolation – up to 1 million years – of high-level radioactive waste under varying conditions is essential. A key concern is the hydro-mechanical response of the clay deposits in which radioactive waste might possibly be stored, in particular during glacial climate conditions as has happened repeatedly in the Netherlands during the Pleistocene. To evaluate this possibility hydro-mechanical computer simulations and mechanical laboratory experiments have been performed to analyse the effects of glacial loading by a thousand-metre-thick ice sheet on the permeability characteristics, fluid flow rates and the associated migration <b>of</b> <b>radio-nuclides</b> both within and out of Tertiary clays. Glacial loading causes the expulsion of pore water from deeply buried clay deposits into adjoining aquifers. The rates and duration of the consolidation-driven outflow {{of water from the}} clay deposit, are very sensitive to the permeability of the clay and the dynamics of the advancing ice sheet. The maximum outflow rate of pore water is 1 mm per year. This rate is approximately three times faster than the flow rate of water in clay prior to ice loading. These preliminary simulation studies also indicate that cyclic loading can result in more rapid migration <b>of</b> <b>radio-nuclides</b> in clays. In clay deposits that are covered by a thick ice sheet, the contribution of dispersed transport relative to the total transport by diffusion amounts to 14 %, assuming that there is no absorption <b>of</b> <b>radio-nuclides</b> by the clays and a longitudinal dispersivity of 50 m.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the research was to study the migration of tritium as the most active radio-nuclide over radioactive waste storage landfills and to project the intensity of industrial pollution of water-bearing layers. Radioactivity is a distinctive feature of tritium. On the one hand, it promotes its extensive use in small quantities in various spheres of the human activity, {{and on the other}} hand, it produces a negative impact on the environment due to its ability to accumulate in cells. The author considers the issue <b>of</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>radio-nuclides</b> both in horizontal and vertical directions to prevent or to limit their release into further zones of waste storage landfills. The proposed monitoring system detects the condition of storage facilities and adjacent zones from the viewpoint of environmental security. It is based on a reliable method of monitoring of the condition of structures. The objective is to ensure the security and further safe operation of depositories. The findings have also served as the instrument of evaluation of effectiveness of implementation of the proposed technology. The methodology assures a timely warning of potential danger due to the negative impact produced by near-surface storage facilities onto the environment in connection with the migration <b>of</b> <b>radio-nuclides.</b> Moreover, extension <b>of</b> the operating life of existing storage facilities may involve a substantial economic effect.

40|$|International audienceMajor solar eruptions (coronal mass ejections) are {{accompanied}} by massive ejections of protons. When these charged particles head for the Earth through the interplanetary magnetic field with high flux and energy, a solar proton event (SPE) is recorded. Strong SPEs, in which energetic protons penetrate the atmosphere in large numbers are rare, but do have chemical effects (Crutzen, 1975; Jackman et al., 1990, 2001). They also have nucleonic effects by which they can almost instantaneously increase the atmospheric production <b>of</b> <b>radio-nuclides,</b> including 14 C (radiocarbon), but this has never been demonstrated. We show, using satellite observations and modeling, that the 2 nd most intensive set of SPEs on record, that of August-December 1989, must have caused detectable increases in atmospheric 14 CO. This is confirmed by a sequence of peaks in the Baring Head (NZ) time series of 14 CO observations (Brenninkmeijer, 1993), probably providing a unique indication of production of 14 C by solar protons, thus demonstrating the use of SPE 14 CO as an atmospheric tracer...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} a new nuclear medical imaging {{technique}} based on the measurement of the emitter location in the three dimensions with a few mm spatial resolution using β+γ emitters. Such measurement could be realized thanks to a new kind <b>of</b> <b>radio-nuclides</b> which emit a γ-ray quasi-simultaneously with the β+ decay. The most interesting radio-nuclide candidate, namely 44 Sc, will be potentially produced at the Nantes cyclotron ARRONAX. The principle is to reconstruct {{the intersection of the}} classical line of response (obtained with a standard PET camera) with the direction cone defined by the third γ-ray. The emission angle measurement of this additional γ-ray involves the use of a Compton telescope for which a new generation of camera based on a liquid xenon (LXe) time projection chamber is considered. GEANT 3 simulations of a large acceptance LXe Compton telescope combined with a commercial micro-PET (LSO crystals) have been performed and the obtained results will be presented. They demonstrate that a good image can be obtained from the accumulation of each three-dimensional measured position.

40|$|Abstract: Due to the {{ubiquitous}} nature of ionizing radiation, in vivo measurement sys-tems {{designed to measure}} low levels <b>of</b> <b>radio-nuclides</b> in people are usually enclosed within a high-density shield. Lead, steel, earth, and water {{are just some of}} the materials that have been and are being used to shield the detectors from radiations of cosmic, atmospheric, man-made, and terrestrial origin. At many Depart-ment of Energy sites, the counting room shields are constructed of pre-World War II steel to reduce the background levels in order to perform measurements that have low minimum detect-able activities. The pre-World War II steel is commonly called low background steel in the in vivo industry vernacular. The low background descriptor comes from the fact the steel was manufactured prior to the beginning of atmo-spheric testing of nuclear weapons in the 1940 ’s. Consequently, the steel is not likely to be contaminated with fission or activation products from fallout. For high energy photons (600 keV E 1500 keV), 30 cm of steel shielding significantly reduces the measured background radiation levels. This is the story of the unique steel that began as the hull of the U. S. S. Indiana and now forms a shielded roo...|$|R

U(IV) products were prepared under varying geochemical conditions and characterized with X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM), and various wet chemical methods. We report an increasing fraction of nonuraninite U(IV) species with decreasing initial U concentration. Additionally, the presence of several common groundwater solutes (sulfate, silicate, and phosphate) promote the formation of nonuraninite U(IV). Our experiments revealed that the presence of those solutes promotes the formation of bacterial extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and increases bacterial viability, suggesting that the formation of nonuraninite U(IV) is due to a biological response to solute presence during U(VI) reduction. The results obtained from this laboratory-scale research provide insight into biogeochemical controls on the product(s) of uranium reduction during bioremediation of the subsurface. 1...|$|R
