25|$|Patriarchy {{is related}} to {{institutionalized}} control, and not merely people’s individual sexism. Much {{research has been done}} to understand why females are stereotypically believed to occupy a domestic character while males are projected to pursue qualified fulfillment outside of the household. Patriarchal structures of discrimination and oppression historically established male privilege by denying females the right to political involvement, in so doing lessening if not eradicating their chances to contribute in the regulations that circumscribe their life. This disunion of work is often plotted onto a social ladder where men's choice to go {{out of the house and}} assumed control over females is seen as foremost. Although each society has to have headship and control, patriarchy has thoroughly subjected females to manipulation, abuse, and subordination. Traditionally, patriarchy gave the father of the family complete possession over the spouse or wives, children, etc. as well as the ability to perform physical exploitation and every so often even those of manslaughter and auction. In certain cases, the juncture of patriarchy as privilege and authority and conceptual ideas of females as properties can habitually turn out to be established into a “rape culture” where rape and further versions of violence toward females are recognized as a usual part of the social order. For example, from the 1900s into the 2000s, Serbs in Croatia, Kosovo, and Bosnia used rape of females as a usual tactic of combat to chastise and threaten inhabitants seen as lesser. Since the government enacts responsibilities and civil liberties, it increases the inquiry of the role of the government in <b>gendering</b> progressions.|$|E

It finds that reducing <b>gender</b> inequality and improving {{the status of women}} may contribute to higher rates of economic growth and greater macroeconomic stability. Women''s relative lack of opportunities in developing countries inhibits economic growth, while, at the same time, economic growth leads to a reduction in their disadvantaged condition. Equality of opportunity in labor and financial markets is critical to enabling women {{to take full advantage of}} improved macroeconomic conditions. Macroeconomic policies should take into account the benefits of reducing <b>gender</b> inequalities, especially in the lowest-income countries where these differences are most pronounced, and should consider the potentially harsher short-term effects of economic austerity measures on women to avoid exacerbating <b>gender</b> inequalities. <b>Gender</b> equality;Economic growth;Economic models;gender inequalities, <b>gender</b> differences, <b>gender</b> issues, <b>gender</b> inequality, health care, girls, fertility, female education, <b>gender</b> bias, status of women, subsistence agriculture, opportunities for women, risk-taking, child mortality, <b>gender</b> disparities, risk taking, <b>gender</b> gap, role of women, <b>gender</b> dimensions, female children, female workers, female labor, fertility rate, economic role of women, <b>gender</b> considerations, employment of women, mother, biological differences, maternal health, <b>gender</b> mainstreaming, employment opportunities for women, household income, birth, <b>gender</b> dimension, women in development, single women, discrimination against women, educational attainment, health services, barriers to women, participation of women, children per woman, <b>gender</b> analysis, female students, <b>gender</b> wage gaps, population growth, subsistence farming, female entrepreneurs, <b>gender</b> equity, <b>gender</b> mainstreaming strategy, <b>gender</b> assessments, family structure, child care, disproportionate effect on women, <b>gender</b> gaps, <b>gender</b> composition, total fertility rate, health status, economics of <b>gender,</b> discriminatory practices, unemployment among women, child health, feminist economics, births, female labor force participation, rights for women, access for women, research on <b>gender</b> differences, <b>gender</b> segregation, control of women, job opportunities for women, hiv/aids, lower fertility, women farmers, poor women, male bias, old age, childbearing, protection of women, cultural factors, gender-based violence, <b>gender</b> relations, female employees, child survival, ministry of women, health care access, <b>gender</b> development, <b>gender</b> discrimination, infant mortality, advancement of women, <b>gender</b> neutrality, <b>gender</b> disparity, women in government, <b>gender</b> implications, access of women, empowerment ? of women, <b>gender</b> distribution, <b>gender</b> impact, united nations development fund for women, unifem, <b>gender</b> specific, empowerment of women, country <b>gender</b> assessments, policy research report on <b>gender,</b> wage discrimination, equality of opportunity, birth weights, mothers, economic opportunities for women, female teachers, <b>gender</b> difference, maternal health care, <b>gender</b> budgeting, integration of <b>gender,</b> female employment, female labor force, family members, growth of women, <b>gender</b> awareness, health of men, child labor, educational <b>gender</b> gaps, unskilled workers, <b>gender</b> sensitization...|$|R

2500|$|Since what {{constitutes}} masculinity has varied by time and place, according to Raewyn Connell, {{it is more}} appropriate to discuss [...] "masculinities" [...] than a single overarching concept. Study {{of the history of}} masculinity emerged during the 1980s, aided by the fields of women’s and (later) gender history. Before women’s history was examined, there was a [...] "strict <b>gendering</b> of the public/private divide"; regarding masculinity, this meant little study of how men related to the household, domesticity and family life. Although women’s historical role was negated, despite the writing of history by (and primarily about) men {{a significant portion of the}} male experience was missing. This void was questioned during the late 1970s, when women’s history began to analyze gender and women to deepen the female experience. Joan Scott’s seminal article, calling for gender studies as an analytical concept to explore society, power and discourse, laid the foundation for this field. According to Scott gender should be used in two ways: productive and produced. Productive gender examined its role in creating power relationships, and produced gender explored the use and change of gender throughout history. This has influenced the field of masculinity, as seen in Pierre Bourdieu’s definition of masculinity: produced by society and culture, and reproduced in daily life. A flurry of work in women’s history led to a call for study of the male role (initially influenced by psychoanalysis) in society and emotional and interpersonal life. Connell wrote that these initial works were marked by a [...] "high level of generality" [...] in [...] "broad surveys of cultural norms". The scholarship was aware of contemporary societal changes aiming to understand and evolve (or liberate) the male role in response to feminism. John Tosh calls for a return to this aim for the history of masculinity to be useful, academically and in the public sphere.|$|E
