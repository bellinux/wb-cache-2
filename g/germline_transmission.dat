40|$|Poly(A/T) tracts are {{abundant}} simple sequence repeats (SSRs) within the human genome. They constitute {{part of the}} coding sequence {{of a variety of}} genes, encoding polylysine stretches that are important for protein function. Assessment of poly(A/T) tract stability is also used to identify microsatellite unstable colorectal cancers, which are characteristic of tumours defective in DNA mismatch repair. Despite their importance, {{little is known about the}} stability of poly(A/T) SSRs in the human germline. We have determined the stability of a paradigm poly(A/T) tract, BAT- 40, by study of population allele frequencies, mutation frequency in families and mutation frequency in sperm DNA. We show that the locus is polymorphic, with a level of heterozygosity of 59. 7 %. Germline mutation was observed in 13 of 187 <b>germline</b> <b>transmissions</b> (7. 0 %) in 10 families suggesting BAT- 40 is unstable in the germline. Further evidence for germline instability at BAT- 40 was provided by small pool PCR analysis of matched blood and sperm DNA templates, revealing a significantly elevated frequency of mutation in the germline (P < 0. 001). These findings provide insight into poly(A/T) tract stability in the germline. They also have relevance to the study of gene expression and to determination of microsatellite instability in tumours...|$|R

Using four loci Bm-ok, BmKMO, BmTH, and Bmtan as candidates, we proved that genome alterations at specific sites could be induced by direct microinjection of specific guide RNA and Cas 9 -mRNA into silkworm embryos. Mutation frequencies of 16. 7 - 35. 0 % were observed in the injected generation, and DNA fragments deletions were also noted. Bm-ok mosaic mutants were used to test for mutant heritability due to the easily determined translucent epidermal phenotype of Bm-ok-disrupted cells. Two crossing strategies were used. In the first, injected Bm-ok moths were crossed with wild-type moths, and a 28. 6 % frequency of <b>germline</b> mutation <b>transmission</b> was observed. In the second strategy, two Bm-ok mosaic mutant moths were crossed with each other, and 93. 6 % of the offsprings appeared mutations in both alleles of Bm-ok gene (compound heterozygous).

Prior genetic analysis mapped Cmvr to the MHC class I (MHC-I) Dk gene interval. Because NK cell receptors are licensed by and responsive to MHC class I molecules, Dk {{itself is a}} candidate gene. A 10 -kb genomic Dk fragment was subcloned and microinjected into MCMV-susceptible (Cmvs) (MA/My. L-H 2 b × C 57 L) F 1 or (B 6 × DBA/ 2) F 2 embryos. Transgenic founders, which are competent for Dk expression and <b>germline</b> transgene <b>transmission,</b> were identified and further backcrossed to MA/My. L-H 2 b or C 57 L mice. Remarkably, Dk expression delivered NK-mediated resistance in either genetic background. Further, NK cells with cognate inhibitory Ly 49 G receptors for self-MHC-I Dk were licensed and critical in protection against MCMV infection. In radiation bone marrow chimeras, NK resistance was significantly diminished when MHC-I Dk expression was restricted to only hematopoietic or nonhematopoietic cells. Thus, MHC-I Dk is the H- 2 k-linked Cmvr locus; these findings suggest a role for NK cell interaction with Dk-bearing hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells to shape NK-mediated virus immunity...|$|R

40|$|The {{peculiar}} {{biology of}} mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) potentially has detrimental consequences for organismal health and lifespan. Typically, eukaryotic cells contain multiple mitochondria, each with multiple mtDNA genomes. The high copy number of mtDNA implies that selection on mtDNA functionality is relaxed. Furthermore, because mtDNA replication is not strictly regulated, within-cell selection may favour mtDNA variants with a replication advantage, but a deleterious effect on cell fitness. The opportunities for selfish mtDNA mutations to spread are restricted by various organism-level adaptations, such as uniparental <b>transmission,</b> <b>germline</b> mtDNA bottlenecks, germline selection and, during somatic growth, regular alternation between fusion and fission of mitochondria. These mechanisms are all hypothesized to maintain functional mtDNA. However, {{the strength of}} selection for maintenance of functional mtDNA progressively declines with age, resulting in age-related diseases. Furthermore, organismal adaptations that most probably evolved to restrict the opportunities for selfish mtDNA create secondary problems. Owing to predominantly maternal mtDNA transmission, recombination among mtDNA from different individuals is highly restricted or absent, reducing the scope for repair. Moreover, maternal inheritance precludes selection against mtDNA variants with male-specific effects. We finish by discussing the consequences of life-history differences among taxa with respect to mtDNA evolution and {{make a case for}} the use of microorganisms to experimentally manipulate levels of selectio...|$|R

A small number of RASopathy cases with disease-causing germline NRAS alterations have been reported. Affected individuals exhibited features fitting Noonan syndrome, and the observed germline variants differed from the typical oncogenic NRAS changes occurring as somatic events in tumours. Here we describe 19 new cases with RASopathy due to disease-causing variants in NRAS. Importantly, four of them harbored missense changes affecting Gly 12, which was previously described to occur exclusively in cancer. The phenotype in our cohort was variable but well within the RASopathy spectrum. Further, one of the patients (c. 35 G>A; p.

40|$|Most human aneuploidies {{originate}} maternally, {{due in part}} to {{the presence}} of highly stringent checkpoints during male meiosis. Indeed, male sterility is common among aneuploid mice used to study chromosomal abnormalities, and male <b>germline</b> <b>transmission</b> of exogenous DNA has been rarely reported. Here we show that, despite aberrant testis architecture, males of the aneuploid Tc 1 mouse strain produce viable sperm and transmit human chromosome 21 to create aneuploid offspring. In these offspring, we mapped transcription, transcriptional initiation, enhancer activity, non-methylated DNA, and transcription factor binding in adult tissues. Remarkably, when compared with mice derived from female passage of human chromosome 21, the chromatin condensation during spermatogenesis and the extensive epigenetic reprogramming specific to male <b>germline</b> <b>transmission</b> resulted in almost indistinguishable patterns of transcriptional deployment.

40|$|Background: Recent {{progress}} in rat {{pluripotent stem cell}} technology has been remarkable. Particularly salient is the demonstration that embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in the rat (rESCs) can contribute to <b>germline</b> <b>transmission,</b> permitting generation of gene-modified rats as is now done using mouse ESCs (mESCs) or mouse {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs; miPSCs). However, determinations of whether rat iPSCs (riPSCs) can contribute to germ cells are not published. Here we report the germline competency of riPSCs. Methodology/Principal Findings: We generated riPSCs by transducing three mouse reprogramming factors (Oct 3 / 4, Klf 4, and Sox 2) into rat somatic cells, followed by culture in the presence of exogenous rat leukemia inhibitory factor (rLIF) and small molecules that specifically inhibit GSK 3, MEK, and FGF receptor tyrosine kinases.

Stocks carrying these elements were tested for repression of P-strain-induced gonadal dysgenesis in females and for repression of transposase-catalyzed P-element excision in males and females. Both traits were repressed by stocks carrying either complete or incomplete P elements inserted near the telomere of the X chromosome in cytological region 1 A, but not by stocks carrying only nontelomeric X-linked P elements. All three of the telomeric P elements that were analyzed {{at the molecular level}} were inserted in one of the 1. 8 -kb telomere-associated sequence (TAS) repeats {{near the end of the}} X chromosome. Stocks with these telomeric P elements strongly repressed P-element excision induced in the male germline by a P strain or by the transposase-producing transgenes H(hsp/CP) 2, H(hsp/CP) 3, a combination of these two transgenes, and P(ry(+), delta 2 - 3) 99 B. For H(hsp/CP) 2 and P(ry(+), delta 2 - 3) 99 B, the repression was also effective when the flies were subjected to heat-shock treatments. However, these stocks did not repress the somatic transposase activity of P(ry(+), delta 2 - 3) 99 B. Repression of transposase activity in the <b>germline</b> required maternal <b>transmission</b> of the telomeric P elements themselves. Paternal transmission of these elements, or maternal transmission of the cytoplasm from carriers, both were insufficient to repress transposase activity.

However, only one founder line showed stable <b>germline</b> integration and <b>transmission,</b> subsequently establishing the only transgenic line (# 11). We obtained 2 F 1 mice and 3 F 2 mice from line # 11. The dHuEPO protein could not be obtained because of repeated spontaneous abortions in the tg mice. Tg mice exhibited symptoms such as short lifespan and abnormal blood composition. The red blood cell count, white blood cell count, and hematocrit levels in the tg mice were remarkably higher than those in the control mice. The spleens of the tg mice (F 1 and F 2 females) were 11 - and - 21 -fold larger than those of the control mice. Microarray analysis revealed 2, 672 spleen-derived candidate genes; more genes were downregulated than upregulated (849 / 764). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) were used for validating the results of the microarray analysis of mRNA expression. Conclusions In conclusion, dHuEPO tg mice caused excessive erythrocytosis that led to abnormal blood composition, short lifespan, and abnormal splenomegaly.

40|$|Establishment and {{maintenance}} of cell type-specific gene expression patterns is essential for development and normal tissue function. A growing number of studies demonstrate that epigenetic information contributes to cell fate specification {{and maintenance}}, and can be transmitted though mitotic divisions {{as well as from}} parents to progeny. Yet, the mechanisms involved in establishing and maintaining epigenetic information, as well as the consequences to gene expression in cells inheriting epigenetic information are not well understood. One form of epigenetic information, post-translational modifications of histones, can regulate gene expression patterns and provide a long-term memory of expression patterns established by transient transcription factor activity during early development. In C. elegans, two antagonistic histone methyltransferases (HMTs) are essential for germline development in a maternal effect manner. MES- 2 is part of a PRC 2 -like complex that methylates H 3 lysine 27 (H 3 K 27 me 3), and MES- 4 is one of two H 3 K 36 me 3 HMTs. This thesis focuses on H 3 K 36 me 3 and the two enzymes that generate this mark, MES- 4 and MET- 1. While MES- 4 is required for germline development in all conditions, MET- 1 is only required at elevated temperatures. Our mass spectrometry analysis of histone tails from C. elegans early embryos confirmed that both MET- 1 and MES- 4 catalyze H 3 K 36 me 3, a modification that is generated by only a single enzyme in other organisms. We performed immunostaining studies to investigate the generation of H 3 K 36 me 3 in the adult <b>germline,</b> its <b>transmission</b> from parents to progeny, and its maintenance during early embryogenesis. Our data show that MET- 1 and MES- 4 serve unique roles in the generation and transmission of H 3 K 36 me 3. In the germline, MET- 1 co-transcriptionally catalyzes H 3 K 36 me 3 and is solely responsible for H 3 K 36 me 3 on the oocyte X chromosome. MES- 4 also contributes to H 3 K 36 me 3 in the germline and is solely responsible for maintenance of H 3 K 36 me 3 on chromosomes in early embryos, where it operates in a transcription-independent manner. We discovered that both oocytes and sperm transmit chromosomes carrying H 3 K 36 me 3 to the embryo. This observation supports the hypothesis that epigenetic information generated in the adult germline can be transmitted to progeny from either parent. To determine if inherited H 3 K 36 me 3 is required for MES- 4 to associate with chromosomes, we generated embryos in which only a subset of chromosomes carry H 3 K 36 me 3. In these embryos, MES- 4 is recruited to H 3 K 36 me 3 -positive chromosomes but not to H 3 K 36 me 3 -negative chromosomes, suggesting MES- 4 is recruited to chromosomes by pre-existing H 3 K 36 me 3. Additionally, as these embryos divide, MES- 4 and H 3 K 36 me 3 are maintained on only a subset of chromosomes until at least the 32 -cell stage, likely because MES- 4 is propagating H 3 K 36 me 3 in regions of chromatin with pre-existing H 3 K 36 me 3. This observation suggests that MES- 4 maintains an epigenetic memory of inherited H 3 K 36 me 3. Together, these data support the model that MET- 1 is primarily responsible for generating H 3 K 36 me 3 on genes expressed in the germline, and that MES- 4 is primarily responsible for maintaining an epigenetic memory of inherited H 3 K 36 me 3 through early embryogenesis, likely to guide gene expression patterns in nascent germ cells...|$|R

We used rabbit models to analyze the risk of <b>germline</b> <b>transmission</b> of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors. Intravenous injection of AAV- 2 or AAV- 8 resulted in liver-mediated, long-term expression of therapeutic levels of human factor IX (hFIX) in a dose-dependent manner. In high-dose cohorts, AAV- 8 resulted in twofold higher levels of circulating hFIX and of vector DNA in liver compared to AAV- 2. Vector sequences were found in the semen of all rabbits. The kinetics of vector clearance from semen was dose- and time-dependent but serotype-independent. No late recurrence of AAV- 8 sequences was found in the semen over several consecutive cycles of spermatogenesis. In a novel rabbit model, AAV- 2 or AAV- 8 sequences were detected in the semen of vasectomized animals that lack germ cells. Therefore, structures of the genitourinary (GU) tract, as well as the testis, contribute significantly to vector shedding in the semen. Collectively, data from these two models suggest that the risk of inadvertent <b>germline</b> <b>transmission</b> in males by AAV- 8 vectors is low, similar to that of AAV- 2, and that AAV dissemination to the semen is in part modulated by host-dependent factors...|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of megabase-sized large DNA fragments into the germline {{has been a}} difficult task.

40|$|Arrhythmogenic right {{ventricular}} cardiomyopathy (ARVC) {{is characterized}} by a high incidence of lethal ventricular arrhythmias, fibrofatty replacement of myocardium, and can account for up to 20 % of sudden cardiac death (SCD) cases in the young. Typically involving autosomal dominant <b>transmission,</b> <b>germline</b> mutations in genes encoding desmosomal proteins have been identified as a cause of ARVC, although the pathogenesis of the disease is still unclear. While early detection and treatment can provide a normal life expectancy for the majority of patients, with less than 10 % progressing to overt right ventricular failure, low genetic penetrance and epigenetic modifiers (such as endurance exercise) can make the condition difficult to diagnose. Addressing this clinical challenge requires {{a better understanding of the}} defective molecular mechanisms that underlie the disease. To that end, the goal of this dissertation is to provide insight into the effects of ARVC-causing mutant proteins on the mechanical and signaling properties of cardiac myocytes. Using elastography and histological techniques, we begin by characterizing the structural and mechanical properties of the native right ventricular myocardium, particularly the right ventricular apex (RVA). Because the RVA is a key site for development of arrhythmias and a potential pacing target, a careful characterization of its structure and mechanical properties are essential for understanding its role in cardiac physiology. In the first section of this dissertation, we perform a systematic analysis of the structural features and mechanical strains in the heart, focusing on the RVA region. More than half of ARVC patients exhibit one or more mutations in genes encoding desmosomal proteins. This has led many investigators to suggest that ARVC is a "disease of the desmosome" in which defective cell-cell adhesion plays a critical pathogenic role, although direct evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. To gain greater insights into potential mechanisms by which desmosomal mutations cause ARVC, we next characterize biomechanical properties and responses to shear stress (motivated by our results in the previous section) in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes expressing two distinct mutant forms of the desmosomal protein plakoglobin which have been linked to ARVC in patients. We show that ARVC-causing mutations in plakoglobin lead to altered cellular distribution of plakoglobin, without alterations in cell mechanical properties or certain early signaling pathways. The identification of defective molecular mechanisms that are common across ARVC-patients remains a strategic area of research. Specifically, recent studies have investigated the mechanistic basis for different ARVC-causing mutations in hopes of identifying common defects in a signaling pathway - information that could be used to develop diagnostic tests or identify therapeutic targets. In the last section of this dissertation, we investigate the effects of mutant plakophilin- 2 expression, and repeat key experiments performed in the previous section to identify common defects in mechanical and signaling properties. We identify a common, underlying defect in ARVC pathogenesis. Specifically, we show that disease-causing mutations across different desmosomal proteins can cause the cell to respond abnormally to mechanical shear stress with respect to plakoglobin trafficking...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a continual}} {{need to improve}} {{efficiency}} in creating precise genetic modifications in mice using embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We describe a novel approach resulting in 100 % <b>germline</b> <b>transmission</b> from competent injected ESCs. We developed an F 1 mouse host embryo (Perfect Host, PH) that selectively ablates its own germ cells via tissue-specific induction of diphtheria toxin. This approach allows competent microinjected ESCs to fully dominate the germline, eliminating competition for this critical niche in the developing and adult animal. This {{is in contrast to}} conventional methods, where competition from host germ cells results in offspring derived from host cells and ESCs, necessitating extensive breeding of chimeras and genotyping to identify germline. The <b>germline</b> <b>transmission</b> process is also complicated by variability in the actual number of ESCs that colonize the germline niche and the proportion that are germline competent. To validate the PH approach we used ESC lines derived from 129 F 1, BALB/cByJ, and BTBR backgrounds as well as an iPS line. Resulting chimeric males produced 194 offspring, all paternally derived from the introduced stem cells, with no offspring being derived from the host genome. We further tested this approach using eleven genetically modified C 57 BL/ 6 N ESC lines (International Knockout Mouse Consortium). ESC <b>germline</b> <b>transmission</b> was observed in 9 / 11 (82 %) lines using PH blastocysts, compared to 6 / 11 (55 %) when conventional host blastocysts were used. Furthermore, less than 35 % (83 / 240) of mice born in the first litters from conventional chimeras were confirmed to be of ESC-origin. By comparison, 100 % (137 / 137) of the first litter offspring of PH chimeras were confirmed as ESC-derived. Together, these data demonstrate that the PH approach increases the probability of <b>germline</b> <b>transmission</b> and speeds the generation of ESC derived animals from chimeras.

It has been adapted to enable high throughput genome editing and has revolutionised the generation of targeted mutations. Results: We have developed a scalable analysis pipeline to identify CRISPR/Cas 9 induced mutations in hundreds of samples using next generation sequencing (NGS) of amplicons. We have used this system to investigate the best way to screen mosaic Zebrafish founder individuals for <b>germline</b> <b>transmission</b> of induced mutations. Screening sperm samples from potential founders provides much better information on <b>germline</b> <b>transmission</b> rates and crucially the sequence of the particular insertions/deletions (indels) that will be transmitted. This enables us to combine screening with archiving to create a library of cryopreserved samples carrying known mutations. It also allows us to design efficient genotyping assays, making identifying F 1 carriers straightforward. Conclusions: The methods described will streamline the production of large numbers of knockout alleles in selected genes for phenotypic analysis, complementing existing efforts using random mutagenesis...|$|E
40|$|Blastocyst {{injection}} and morula aggregation {{are commonly}} used to evaluate stem cell pluripotency based on chimeric contribution of the stem cells. To assess the protocols for generating chimeras from stem cells, 8 -cell mouse embryos were either injected or cocultured with mouse embryonic stem cells and {{induced pluripotent stem cells}}, respectively. Although a significantly higher chimera rate resulted from blastocyst injection, the highest germline contribution resulted from injection of 8 -cell embryos with embryonic stem cells. The fully agouti colored chimeras were generated from both injection and coculture of 8 -cell embryos with embryonic stem cells. Additionally, microsatellite DNA screening showed that the fully agouti colored chimeras were fully embryonic stem cell derived mice. Unlike embryonic stem cells, the mouse chimeras were only generated from injection of 8 -cell embryos with induced pluripotent stem cells and none of these showed <b>germline</b> <b>transmission.</b> The results indicated that injection of 8 -cell embryos is the most efficient method for assessing stem cell pluripotency and generating induced pluripotent stem cell chimeras, embryonic stem cell chimeras with <b>germline</b> <b>transmission,</b> and fully mouse embryonic stem cell derived mice...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{transfer}} of human and murine globin gene sequences into fertilized mouse oocytes by microinjection. <b>Germline</b> <b>transmission</b> was demonstrated for the human delta- and beta-globin genes contained in the bacteriophage lambda H beta G 1. Expression of these human globin-gene sequences was not detectable in either erythroid or nonerythroid tissues. A recombinant plasmid containing the murine beta maj promoter region coupled to the prokaryotic coding sequence for galactokinase was also successfully transferred to two mice, and stable <b>germline</b> <b>transmission</b> of integrated DNA was demonstrated for at least 3 generations. Despite {{the presence of a}} murine globin-promoter sequence, expression of the mouse beta maj galactokinase fusion gene was not observed in primary or secondary animals in erythroid or nonerythroid tissues. Analysis of primary and secondary animals from both series of injections revealed extensive de novo methylation in the integrated microinjected DNA. Administration of 5 -azacytidine to mice containing the mouse beta maj-promoted galactokinase gene resulted in partial hypomethylation was associated with an apparent two- to threefold increase in galactokinase (gal K) gene expression...|$|E
40|$|CRISPR/Cas 9 {{has emerged}} as a {{versatile}} genome-engineering tool that relies on a single guide RNA (sgRNA) and the Cas 9 enzyme for genome editing. Simple, fast and economical methods to generate sgRNAs have made targeted mutagenesis routine in cultured cells, mice, zebrafish and other model systems. Pre-screening of sgRNAs for target effi-cacy is desirable both for successful mutagenesis and minimizing wasted animal husbandry on targets with poor activity. Here, we describe an easy, quick and cost-effective fluorescent polymerase chain re-action (PCR) -based method, CRISPR Somatic Tissue Activity Test (CRISPR-STAT), to determine target-specific efficiency of sgRNA. As a proof of princi-ple, we validated our method using 28 sgRNAs with known and varied levels of <b>germline</b> <b>transmission</b> ef-ficiency in zebrafish by analysis of their somatic ac-tivity in injected embryos. Our data revealed a strong positive correlation between the fluorescent PCR profiles of the injected embryos and the <b>germline</b> <b>transmission</b> efficiency. Furthermore, the assay was sensitive enough to evaluate multiplex gene target-ing. This method is easy to implement by laborato-ries with access to a capillary sequencer. Although we validated the method using CRISPR/Cas 9 and ze-brafish, it can be applied to other model systems and other genome targeting nucleases...|$|E
40|$|Germ cells undergo {{comprehensive}} epigenetic reprogramming toward acquiring {{fitness for}} pluripotency and totipotency. Notably, {{the full extent}} of the epigenetic reprogramming experienced by germ cells remains unmatched by attempts to experimentally restore pluripotency in somatic cells. We propose that the defects present in experimentally generated cells are corrected upon differentiation into the germ cell lineage, as has been observed in cases of <b>germline</b> <b>transmission.</b> Unraveling the mechanisms responsible for germ cell-specific epigenetic reprogramming will likely have important implications for both basic and clinical stem cell research...|$|E
40|$|Previously, we {{designed}} a chromosomal vector (CV) and reported <b>germline</b> <b>transmission</b> of the vector by mice and regulated {{expression of the}} human tissue factor (F 3) gene present on the CV. Further characterization {{and development of the}} CV are presented here. Mice could be bred with one to four copies of the CV per cell, and it is shown that F 3 expression is proportional to the CV copy number. The insertion of large sequences into the CV was investigated by the insertion of a PAC, carrying 62. 5 kb of human genomic DNA containing the CSN 2 and STATH genes, into the CV by means of Cre/loxP recombination (CV(PAC)). Retrofitting the PAC with a cytomegalovirus (CMV) - 5 'HPRT/loxP cassette in Escherichia coli allowed efficient selection of CVs with PAC insert. Mitotic loss rates of the CV(PAC) were similar to the original CV. Furthermore, <b>germline</b> <b>transmission</b> efficiency and mitotic stability of the CV(PAC) in mice were not compromised. The human CSN 2 and STATH genes were not expressed in the transchromosomal mice. In contrast, F 3, already present on the CV, was expressed in CV(PAC) (+) F(1) mice similar to in CV(+) mice, suggesting that the insertion of large sequences does not interfere with transcription of genes present on the CV. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|At present, genetically {{modified}} rats {{have not been}} generated from ES cells because stable ES cells and a suitable injection method are not available. To monitor the pluripotency of rat ES cells, we generated Oct 4 -Venus transgenic (Tg) rats via a conventional method, in which Venus is expressed by the Oct 4 promoter/enhancer. This monitoring system enabled us to define a significant condition of culture to establish authentic rat ES cells based {{on a combination of}} 20 % FBS and cell signaling inhibitors for Rho-associated kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, TGF-β, and glycogen synthase kinase- 3. The rat ES cells expressed ES cell markers such as Oct 4, Nanog, Sox 2, and Rex 1 and retained a normal karyotype. Embryoid bodies and teratomas were also produced from the rat ES cells. All six ES cell lines derived from three different rat strains successfully achieved <b>germline</b> <b>transmission,</b> which strongly depended on the presence of the inhibitors during the injection process. Most importantly, high-quality Tg rats possessing a correct transgene expression pattern were successfully generated via the selection of gene-manipulated ES cell clones through <b>germline</b> <b>transmission.</b> Our rat ES cells should be sufficiently able to receive gene targeting as well as Tg manipulation, thus providing valuable animal models for the study of human diseases...|$|E
40|$|Transposons {{are very}} {{valuable}} tools for genetic manipulation. However, {{the number of}} transposable elements that have been suitably adapted for experimental use is insufficient and the spectrum of heterologous hosts {{in which they have}} been deployed is restricted. To date, only transposons from animal hosts have been utilized in heterologous animal species and transposons of plant origin have been used in plant genetics. There has been no experimental evidence that any of the known elements could transpose in hosts belonging to both kingdoms. Here we demonstrate that the maize Dissociation (Ds) element is capable of effective Activator (Ac) transposase-mediated transposition in the zebrafish Danio rerio, yielding remarkable <b>germline</b> <b>transmission</b> rates. In addition, mammalian cells were also found to be conducive to Ds transposition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that nuclear localization of Ac transposase is essential for genomic Ds transposition. Our results support the hypothesis that Ac/Ds elements do not rely on host-specific factors for transposition and that host factors involved in their mobility mechanism are widely conserved. Finally, even in vertebrate cells, the Ac/Ds system displays accurate transposition, large-fragment carrying capacity, high transposition frequencies, efficient <b>germline</b> <b>transmission,</b> and reporter gene expression, all of which are advantageous for various genetic applications and animal biotechnology...|$|E
40|$|Spermatogonial {{stem cells}} (SSCs) undergo {{self-renewal}} division to support spermatogenesis. Although several positive regulators of SSC self-renewal have been identified, {{little is known}} about the mechanisms that negatively regulate SSCs. Here we developed a novel transplantation assay for SSCs and demonstrate that p 21 and p 27 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors play critical roles in SSC self-renewal and differentiation. Overexpression of p 21 or p 27 abrogated proliferation of cultured SSCs in vitro, and their expression levels were downregulated by exogenous self-renewal signals. In contrast, no apparent defects were found in p 21 or p 27 -deficient SSCs by spermatogonial transplantation. However, competitive spermatogonial transplantation with WT SSCs revealed that the loss of either gene causes distortion of germline transmission: p 21 -deficiency facilitated mutant offspring production, whereas <b>germline</b> <b>transmission</b> was limited by p 27 -deficiency. Serial transplantation also showed that the loss of p 27, but not p 21, decreases secondary colony formation, suggesting that appropriate amounts of p 27 are necessary for sustaining SSC self-renewal. Thus, p 21 and p 27 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors play critical roles in <b>germline</b> <b>transmission</b> by regulating the balance between SSC self-renewal and differentiation, and competitive spermatogonial transplantation technique will be useful for analyzing subtle defects in spermatogenesis that are not evident by traditional spermatogonial transplantation...|$|E
40|$|Somatic {{activating}} {{mutations in}} EGFR identify {{a subset of}} {{non-small cell lung cancer}} that respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Acquisition of drug resistance is linked to a specific secondary somatic mutation, EGFR T 790 M. Here we describe a family with multiple cases of non-small cell lung cancer associated with <b>germline</b> <b>transmission</b> of this mutation. Four of six tumors analyzed showed a secondary somatic activating EGFR mutation, arising in cis with the germline EGFR mutation T 790 M. These observations implicate altered EGFR signaling in genetic susceptibility to lung cancer...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of transgenesis in axolotls {{is crucial for}} studying development and regeneration as it would allow for long-term cell fate tracing as well as gene expression analysis. We demonstrate here that plasmid injection into the one-cell stage axolotl embryo generates mosaic transgenic animals that display <b>germline</b> <b>transmission</b> of the transgene. The inclusion of SceI meganuclease in the injections (Thermes, V., Grabher, C., Ristoratore, F., Bourrat, F., Choulika, A., Wittbrodt, J., Joly, J. S., 2002. I-SceI meganuclease mediates highly efficient transgenesis in fish. Mech. Dev. 118, 91 – 98) resulted in {{a higher percentage of}} F 0 animals displaying strong expression throughout the body. This represents the first demonstration in the axolotl of <b>germline</b> <b>transmission</b> of a transgene. Using this technique we have generated a germline transgenic animal expressing GFP ubiquitously in all tissues examined. We have used this animal to study cell fate in the dorsal fin during development. We have uncovered a contribution of somite cells to dorsal fin mesenchyme in the axolotl, which was previously assumed to derive solely from neural crest. We have also studied the role of blood during tail regeneration by transplanting the ventral blood-forming region from GFP+ embryos into unlabeled hosts. During tail regeneration, we do not observe GFP+ cells contributing to muscle or nerve, suggesting that during tail regeneration blood stem cells do not undergo significant plasticity...|$|E

This observation contributes greatly to the improvement of iPSC technology and might be a step towards 'designer' reprogramming strategies by generating high quality iPSCs. Further studies comparing pluripotency regulation in different species, including that in human, will be necessary to verify the universal role of Tbx 3 and the medical relevance of the observation...|$|E
