Impurities that are more noble than lead, such as silver, gold, and bismuth, flake from the anode as it dissolves and settle {{to the bottom of the}} vessel as [...] "anode mud."

The main product used to flocculate suspended material and reduce turbidity is aluminum sulphate, which has the highest share of the cost of chemicals for the treatment process. The use of the other single chemical products is also correlated to the performance of the treatment process, where, for example the better the quality of the final product (i.e. treated/filtered water), the lower the cost with the rest of the chemical products, namely <b>hexafluorosilicic</b> <b>acid,</b> chlorine and calcium oxide.|$|E
40|$|Etching {{of silicon}} with {{mixtures}} of hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid {{is a widely}} used process in silicon solar cell fabrication. One precondition for an optimized usage of the acidic etching baths is the exact knowledge of the chemical bath composition. In this paper, we investigated a fast and online-capable method for the total analysis of all bath constituents by ion chromatography. The chromatographical system consists of a low-volume injection valve, which injects the concentrated samples directly into the KOH-based eluent. After separation and detection of nitrate and fluoride, a post-column derivatization with sodium molybdate is applied to detect the <b>hexafluorosilicic</b> <b>acid,</b> which enriches in the texturisation bath during the etching process.

40|$|The acidic {{texturisation}} {{process is}} an important and widely used step in the fabrication of mulitcrystalline silicon solar cells. The resulting silicon surface structure mainly depends on the concentrations of the hydrofluoric acid (HF), nitric acid (HNO 3) and <b>hexafluorosilicic</b> <b>acid</b> (H 2 SiF 6). Therefore, a continuous dosing of concentrated acids is necessary to remain a constant etching rate and a constant surface structure. In {{state of the art}} process tools, this dosing is triggered by a certain number of processed wafers. Small inaccuracies in the silicon entry or the dosed volume lead to significant drifts of the acid concentrations. We present an automated dosing algorithm using NIR-spectroscopy for the concentration measurement, which is able to keep the bath composition in an optimal process window. A theoretical approach suggests, that the used algorithm is able to keep the etching rate constant in a range of ± 2 ?m/min. First experiments using this algorithm in an inline process tool show, that the mechanism finds the optimal concentrations from a starting point, where both, HFand HNO 3 -concentrations are too low...|$|E
