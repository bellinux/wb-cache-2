40|$|Social network {{games are}} popular pastime for {{millions}} of players on Facebook. Despite their popularity, qualitative research on <b>experiences</b> <b>in</b> these games has been scarce. In our study, 110 informants played 23 games on Facebook and reported their experiences using the Playful Experiences (PLEX) framework. We analyzed 110 reports containing 330 PLEX descriptions and present findings from three perspectives. First, we provide an overall analysis on playful <b>experiences</b> <b>in</b> social network games. Then we focus on genre-specific <b>experiences</b> <b>in</b> casual puzzle, casual simulation, and mid-core strategy games. Lastly, we provide examples of interesting outlier experiences. Based on our study, Competition, Completion and Challenge {{are the most common}} playful <b>experiences</b> <b>in</b> these games. The genre-specific analysis revealed both similarities and differences between the genres, while the outlier experiences provide new perspectives on social network games. Through the PLEX framework, this research helps to understand the playful <b>experiences</b> <b>in</b> social network games...|$|R
