50|$|Line editors {{are limited}} to {{typewriter}} keyboard text-oriented input and output methods. Most edits are a line-at-a-time. Typing, editing, and <b>document</b> <b>display</b> do not occur simultaneously. Typically, typing does not enter text directly into the document. Instead, users modify the document text by entering terse commands on a text-only terminal. Commands and text, and corresponding output from the editor, will scroll {{up from the bottom}} of the screen in the order that they are entered or printed to the screen. Although the commands typically indicate the line(s) they modify, displaying the edited text within the context of larger portions of the document requires a separate command.|$|E

In order to facilitate review and discussion, we chose to display the standard in a format similar to a textbook's Table of Contents (TOC), with subsequent information displayed in an outline format.

40|$|While Implicit Relevance Feedback (IRF) {{algorithms}} exploit users ’ {{interactions with}} information to customize support offered to users of search systems, {{it is unclear}} how individual and task differences impact the effectiveness of such algorithms. In this paper we describe a study on the effect on retrieval performance of using additional information about the user and their search tasks when developing IRF algorithms. We tested four algorithms that use <b>document</b> <b>display</b> time to estimate relevance, and tailored the threshold times (i. e., the time distinguishing relevance from non-relevance) to the task, the user, a combination of both, or neither. Interaction logs gathered during a longitudinal naturalistic study of online information-seeking behavior are used as stimuli for the algorithms. The findings show that tailoring display time thresholds based on task information improves IRF algorithm performance, but doing so based on user information worsens performance. This has implications for the development of effective IRF algorithms...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{design and}} {{performance}} of a practical integrated tool for writer identification in forensic scenarios is presented. The tool {{has been designed to}} help forensic examiners along the complete identification process: from the data acquisition to the recognition itself, {{as well as with the}} management of large writer-related databases. The application has been implemented using JavaScript running over a relational database which provides the whole system with some very desirable and unique characteristics such as the possibility to perform all type of queries (e. g., find individuals with some very discriminative character, find a specific <b>document,</b> <b>display</b> all the samples corresponding to one writer, etc.), or a complete control over the set of parameters we want to use in a specific recognition task (e. g., users in the database to be used as control set, set of characters to be used in the identification, size of the ranked list we want as final result, etc.). The identification performance of the tool is evaluated on a real-case forensic database showing some very promising results...|$|E

The project is a partnership between the UNLV University Libraries, {{the director of the}} NTSOHP, campus, and community partners to create an online, fully searchable, digital re-search collection from the collected oral history research. Project participants include scientists, miners, military officers, contractors and corporate executives. Also presented are the voices of native tribal leaders, peace activists and communities downwind of the test site. Working with controversial material, deciphering military code names, and negotiating government acronyms were all unique challenges to the project.

40|$|Information {{devices are}} getting both smaller and larger {{as we move}} beyond the {{traditional}} desktop. On the one hand, the lighter, smaller and more portable smart phones and tablets are replacing devices such as desktop computers and laptops (see Figure 1). On the other hand, desktop displays have increased in size or have multiplied on a single desktop, and shared displays have grown to cover entire walls or to form rooms that users can enter. This trend has continued {{for more than a}} decade but has accelerated with the introduction of the iPhone, iPad, dense flash memory, and inexpensive large screen monitors. The next phase of computing beyond the desktop monitor will explore how these new devices interact with one another to support collaborative data collection, analytics, sense-making, and performance. There are five primary display modalities: Ambient (or glance-able) displays with physical sensors (such as a• thermostat that changes color whenever there is a power shortage) Handheld displays that can easily slip into a pocket or purse • Personal document displays (tablets, ultrathin laptops) that are mobile and• good for reading and editing Large desktop monitors used as personal workspaces for simultaneously• viewing information from several sources or perspectives Very large shared displays that support data immersion or shared viewing;• these range from the size of large televisions to the size of walls and may be horizontal (tabletop monitors) or vertical For each of these, there are debates among users over form and function.
