40|$|Thesis (MEd) [...] PU vir CHO. 1986 Parent {{involvement}} in education is an accepted fact {{in accordance with}} the philosophy of Christian-national education on which the sub-educational system for whites in the RSA is based. To give expression to this principle representative parent bodies like management councils, the “Transvaal Afrikaanse Ouervereniging” and the Transvaal Parents' Association were founded. Problems in obtaining meaningful and effective parent participation are, however, still experienced. Inadequate parental involvement could be attributed, in part, to insufficient knowledge of parents regarding {{involvement in}} the education of their children. The educational system makes provision for <b>guidance</b> - and <b>educational</b> responsibilities regarding parent involvement. Guidance to parents is, however, a specialised field and could be seen as an educational aid to schools. The <b>educational</b> advisor (<b>guidance)</b> as a professional advisor, who provides specific guidance services as an aid to schools and parents, has the necessary skills to assist parents in becoming increasingly involved in education. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine which structures and mechanisms may effectively be used to bring about liaison between the <b>educational</b> advisor (<b>guidance)</b> and parent-associations. By using the fundamental reflective method an effort is made to critically evaluate the collected information. The field of study includes the description of specific educational structures for liaison between the <b>educational</b> advisor (<b>guidance)</b> and parents of the school. This study pays particular attention to the South African educational system, the implementation of education within the sub-system of Whites, the system of educational ancillary services, and specifically, the educational aid service, as part of the execution of education. The duty of the <b>educational</b> advisor (<b>guidance)</b> includes liaison possibilities which facilitate parental involvement regarding elected parent bodies and the <b>educational</b> advisor (<b>guidance)</b> within the <b>educational</b> system. Chapter 1 deals with the motivation for the investigation, problem of research, aims of research and methods of research. Chapter 2 is devoted to the investigation of certain aspects of the education system as well as to the execution of education within the sub-education system for Whites in South Africa. Chapter 3 concerns itself with Educational Aid services in Transvaal as a facet of the educational system as well as the task of the <b>educational</b> advisor (<b>guidance).</b> The purpose of this discussion is to place these facets of educational implementation within the educational system in the correct perspective. In Chapter 4 attention is given to the structured possibilities for parental involvement as manifested at present. Attention is also given to fundamental structures of parental involvement and the proficiency needed for parents to enable meaningful educational involvement. Chapter 5 devotes itself to the description of the skills required of the <b>educational</b> advisor (<b>guidance)</b> regarding possible channels of liaison with elected parents associations. This will create opportunities for positive learning experiences, thus providing the parents with the necessary knowledge to become meaningfully involved in the education of their children, which in turn, will prevent behavioural problems. Chapter 6 consist of certain conclusive ideas, deductions and recommendations. This research established that parents must possess a certain knowledge to enable them to become meaningfully involved in the school education of their children. It was also apparent that acknowledgement is given by the Transvaal Education Department regarding the principle of parental involvement. It is also clear that the <b>educational</b> advisor (<b>guidance)</b> possesses the necessary skills to equip parents regarding increasing involvement education. Master...|$|R

40|$|Syftet med föreliggande studie är att söka utröna om och i vilken utsträckning lärare i olika ämnen på grund- och gymnasieskola tar upp frågor eller problem som är förknippade med den studie- och yrkesorienterande verksamheten. 124 av 150 lärare besvarade hösten 1977 en enkät. Bland resultaten kan nämnas att 60 % av lärarna anser att de inte berör syo i sin undervisning och att 67 % anser att det inte finns syostoff i det använda undervisningsmaterialet. De gyoaktiviteter som anses förekomma verkar vidare vara av mer spontan karaktär. Totalt uppger 13 % av lärarna att man medvetet planerar in syomoment i undervisningen. I den avslutande diskussionen påpekas bl a att de aspekter som ryms inom företeelsen "syo i undervisningen" är många och att denna studie bara kunnat belysa ett fåtal. The aim of {{this study}} is to find out if and to what extent {{teachers}} of different subjects in the 9 -year compulsory comprehensive school and the upper secondary school take up questions or problems connected with <b>educational</b> vocational <b>guidance.</b> 124 of 150 teachers answered a questionnaire in the autumn of 1977. The results show, among other things, that 60 % of the teachers consider that they do not deal with <b>educational</b> and vocational <b>guidance</b> in their teaching and that 67 % consider that there is nothing which touches upon <b>educational</b> and vocational <b>guidance</b> in their teaching material. The activities connected with <b>educational</b> and vocational <b>guidance</b> seem, moreover, to be of a more spontaneous character. A total of 13 % of the teachers state that they regularly take up questions related to <b>educational</b> and vocational <b>guidance</b> in their teaching. The concluding discussion shows, among other things, that the aspects included in "educational and vocational guidance in teaching" are numerous and that it has only been possible to elucidate a few of them in this study. digitalisering@um...|$|R
