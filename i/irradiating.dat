5|$|The {{isotopes}} of nobelium {{are mostly}} produced by bombarding actinide targets (uranium, plutonium, curium, californium, or einsteinium), {{with the exception}} of nobelium-262, which is produced as the daughter of lawrencium-262. The most commonly used isotope, 255No, can be produced from bombarding curium-248 or californium-249 with carbon-12: the latter method is more common. <b>Irradiating</b> a 350μgcm−2 target of californium-249 with threetrillion (3×1012) 73MeV carbon-12 ions per second for ten minutes can produce around 1200 nobelium-255 atoms.|$|E
5|$|By February 1944, {{the reactor}} was <b>irradiating</b> {{a ton of}} uranium every three days. Over the next five months, the {{efficiency}} of the separation process was improved, with the percentage of plutonium recovered increasing from 40 to 90 percent. Modifications over time raised the reactor's power to 4,000kW in July 1944. Unfortunately, the effect of the neutron poison xenon-135, one of many fission products produced from the uranium fuel, was not detected during the early operation of the X-10 Graphite Reactor. Xenon-135 subsequently caused problems with the startup of the Hanford B reactor that nearly halted the plutonium project.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the use of}} both biochemical and anatomical techniques to detect <b>irradiated</b> larvae and pupae of the Tephritid fruit fly Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt). Electrophoretic protein profiles for control and <b>irradiated</b> larvae were similar, irrespective of {{the age at which}} irradiation occurred. Protein profiles for control and <b>irradiated</b> pupae were also similar for the first 2 d of pupation. A new protein band was detected in control pupae 3 d after pupation began. This band was not observed in any <b>irradiated</b> pupae. However, because pupae cannot be aged morphologically, the absence of this protein band cannot be used to distinguish between <b>irradiated</b> and non-irradiated pupae of unknown age. Dissections of pupae indicated that the new protein band was not present because <b>irradiated</b> pupae died during the first days of pupation. No <b>irradiated</b> pupae survived to emergence. Electrophoretic techniques did not identify consistently either <b>irradiated</b> larvae or pupae of B. tryoni. The corrected size of the supraesophageal ganglion in <b>irradiated</b> mature larvae was significantly small than in untreated larvae, ragardless of the age at which irradiation occurred. This reduction was ~ 64 % in samples treated as eggs (26 h), first (72 h), and second (96 h) instars and 24 % in third instars. A significant reduction in size of supraesophageal ganglion of mature third instars from all irradiation treatments suggests that this character may be successfully used to detect B. tryoni <b>irradiated</b> at quarantine dose rates. <b>Irradiated</b> samples had a significantly longer larval and pupation period, possibly because of the inability of <b>irradiated</b> larvae to feed normally. We also observed a significant increase in larval mortality with decreasing age at irradiation...|$|R

5|$|Construction {{commenced}} on {{the pilot}} separation plant before a chemical process for separating plutonium from uranium had been selected. In May 1943, DuPont managers {{decided to use}} the bismuth-phosphate process. The plant consisted of six cells, separated from each other and the control room by thick concrete walls. The equipment was operated remotely from the control room. Construction work was completed on 26 November, but the plant could not operate until the reactor started producing irradiated uranium slugs. The first batch was received on 20 December, allowing the first plutonium to be produced in early 1944. By February, the reactor was <b>irradiating</b> a ton of uranium every three days. Over the next five months, the efficiency of the separation process was improved, with the percentage of plutonium recovered increasing from 40 to 90 percent. X-10 operated as a plutonium production plant until January 1945, when it was turned over to research activities. By this time, 299 batches of irradiated slugs had been processed.|$|E
5|$|Production {{methods for}} the {{elements}} less frequently recognised as metalloids involve natural processing, electrolytic or chemical reduction, or irradiation. Carbon (as graphite) occurs naturally and is extracted by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter graphite to the surface. Aluminium is extracted by dissolving its oxide Al2O3 in molten cryolite Na3AlF6 {{and then by}} high temperature electrolytic reduction. Selenium is produced by roasting the coinage metal selenides X2Se (X = Cu, Ag, Au) with soda ash to give the selenite: X2Se + O2 + Na2CO3 → Na2SeO3 + 2 X + CO2; the selenide is neutralized by sulfuric acid H2SO4 to give selenous acid H2SeO3; this is reduced by bubbling with SO2 to yield elemental selenium.

In the term of LD 50 the lethality of AgNPs in normal and <b>irradiated</b> mice was undertaken. The LD 50 of AgNPs in normal and <b>irradiated</b> (4 Gy) mice is 268. 781 mg (ppm) and 425. 990 mg (ppm), respectively. Toxicity was reduced in <b>irradiated</b> mice as compared to normal mice. The selected doses used in the subchronic study were orally administered for 28 days. The doses corresponds to 1 / 10 LD 50 which are 26. 878 and 42. 599 mg in normal and <b>irradiated</b> rats, respectively. Following the 28 days liver and kidney function tests, changes in body weight, organ weight/body weight ratio (ow/bw), histopathological study and AgNPs distribution in liver, kidney, lung, testes were taken as a criteria for evaluation of the toxicity in normal and <b>irradiated</b> rats. Data showed significant decrease in serum urea and AST levels in <b>irradiated</b> group and {{a significant increase in}} serum GGT in AgNPs group. AgNPs significantly increased body weight.

Changes in ow/bw ratio has been shown in testes in both <b>irradiated</b> and <b>irradiated</b> treated AgNPs groups. Histopathological findings showed damage in liver, kidney and lung in both AgNPs and <b>irradiated</b> treated AgNPs groups. The damage in the liver in <b>irradiated</b> treated is less than that of AgNPs group. That may be explained that irradiation decrease the toxic effect of AgNPs on liver.

5|$|To predict if the {{production}} of mendelevium would be possible, the team made use of a rough calculation. The number of atoms that would be produced would be approximately equal to {{the product of the}} number of atoms of target material, the target's cross section, the ion beam intensity, and the time of bombardment; this last factor was related to the half-life of the product when bombarding for a time on the order of its half-life. This gave one atom per experiment. Thus under optimum conditions, the preparation of only one atom of element 101 per experiment could be expected. This calculation demonstrated that it was feasible {{to go ahead with the}} experiment. The target material, einsteinium-253, could be produced readily from <b>irradiating</b> plutonium: one year of irradiation would give a billion atoms, and its three-week half-life meant that the element 101 experiments could be conducted in one week after the produced einsteinium was separated and purified to make the target.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} irradiation on the oxidative quality changes during the storage, pork loin and turkey breast muscles were <b>irradiated</b> using an electron beam. Irradiation accelerated lipid oxidation, increased redness, and produced several sulfur (S) -volatiles that were responsible for the characteristic irradiation off-odor. This quality deterioration by irradiation was dependent on packaging conditions. Lipid oxidation was more problematic when meat was aerobically stored, whereas the production of S-volatiles was greater in vacuum-packaged <b>irradiated</b> raw meats. But when meat was freezer-stored, aerobic packaging was more susceptible to the production of both oxidation-dependent and S-volatiles. Irradiation made the color of meats redder and the redness was more distinct and stable under vacuum conditions. In <b>irradiated</b> meat, the production of carbon monoxide (CO), which can bind to myoglobin as a sixth ligand, was proportional to the irradiation dose. Oxidation-reduction potential was also decreased by irradiation indicating that more reducing conditions were supplied to heme pigments. Thus, it can be concluded that the increased a*-values in <b>irradiated</b> meat was caused by heme pigment-CO ligand formation. The absorption spectra of meat drip also showed that the peak wavelengths of <b>irradiated</b> meat were {{similar to those of the}} CO-myoglobin. Therefore, we suggest that CO-myoglobin be a major heme pigment responsible for the red or pink color in <b>irradiated</b> meats. These color changes and the mechanisms in <b>irradiated</b> raw meat were similar in <b>irradiated</b> precooked meat. A few strategies to reduce the oxidative quality deterioration of <b>irradiated</b> meats were studied. Addition of an antioxidant (sesamol, gallate, Trolox, or alpha-tocopherol) or their combination was effective in reducing the S-volatiles in vacuum-packaged <b>irradiated</b> meats or in controlling lipid oxidation in aerobically packaged <b>irradiated</b> ones. A modified packaging concept (double-packaging; combined use of vacuum and aerobic packaging) was also effective in eliminating S-volatiles and minimizing lipid oxidation during the storage. Especially, gallate + alpha-tocopherol along with double-packaging reduced effectively the red color of <b>irradiated</b> raw and cooked meats. These beneficial effects of double-packaging and antioxidant were more critical in <b>irradiated</b> cooked meat, and it was a very effective method to control the oxidative quality changes of <b>irradiated</b> meats...|$|R
