40|$|The Internet {{is now a}} {{significant}} medium for sport coverage, allowing fans to access the latest news about their favourite team, sport or event. To date, <b>Internet</b> <b>sport</b> journalists, the content creators of sporting news websites, have received little attention in academic research. Accordingly, {{the aim of this}} research project was to construct a profile of Australian <b>Internet</b> <b>sport</b> journalists within the context of recent developments in the field of sport and new media. In terms of print journalism, some researchers have previously examined the educational background, working practices and self-assessment of print sport journalists. Similar themes were explored in this thesis, using semi-structured interviews with thirteen <b>Internet</b> <b>sport</b> journalists. Key research questions that guided the study were: How did the subjects become <b>Internet</b> <b>sport</b> journalists? What are their work routines? What are their experiences of online sport journalism and what is their perception of the future of sport journalism? It was discovered that, with certain limitations, traditional journalism skills still apply to the <b>Internet</b> <b>sport</b> environment. In comparison to print media, <b>Internet</b> <b>sport</b> journalists tend to write shorter articles, have to respond to a continuous deadline and do not work within a traditional beat system. In addition, it can be noted that the interactivity of the <b>Internet</b> forces <b>Internet</b> <b>sport</b> journalists to continually re-evaluate their skills {{and the manner in which}} they respond to their audience. Overall, this thesis provides important insights into the working practices of Australian <b>Internet</b> <b>sport</b> journalists and the online environment, an occupational field that is currently in a considerable state of flux...|$|R

40|$|Promotions {{for online}} sports betting during {{televised}} sports broadcasts are regularly viewed {{by millions of}} Australians, raising concerns about their impacts on vulnerable groups including at-risk and problem gamblers. This study examined whether responses to these promotions varied with problem gambling severity amongst 455 Australian <b>Internet</b> <b>sports</b> bettors participating in an online survey. Results indicated that young male <b>Internet</b> <b>sports</b> bettors are especially vulnerable to gambling problems, particularly if they hold positive attitudes to gambling sponsors who embed promotions into sports broadcasts and to the promotional techniques they use and this heightens the risk that alluring messages contribute to excessive gambling. As problem gambling severity increased, so too did recognition that these promotions have impacted negatively on their sports betting behaviour. Because a plethora of sports betting brands and promotions are now heavily integrated into sports coverage, social marketing efforts are needed to offset their persuasive appeal and counter the positive attitudes towards them that appear linked to excessive gambling amongst <b>Internet</b> <b>sports</b> bettors...|$|R
