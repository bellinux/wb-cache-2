40|$|The {{ever more}} {{electrified}} and energy-intensive society increases {{the need for}} a secure power grid and energy service. The transmission system is the backbone of the electrical power infrastructure, to have a well-functioning protection system of this is therefore crucial. The most common type of faults in the power grid are ground faults on overhead lines, which makes it important to be sure about how the relays will measure such a fault. Distance protection is the preferred protection scheme for the transmission grid, thus it is of importance to determine how the performance of these depends on parameters like presence of <b>ground</b> <b>wires,</b> <b>ground</b> conductivity, system neutral earthing, different types of faults and size of fault resistance. This masters thesis investigates the impact that presence of <b>ground</b> <b>wires</b> has on the ability of the distance relay to detect single phase-to-ground faults in a grid with solid earthed neutral. In compensated earthed networks it is investigated whether the distance relays are able to distinguish two single phase-to-ground faults at two different phases occurring at the same time but at distant locations from a single ground fault. To investigate these scenarios, models of a transmission line and a section of a transmission grid were implemented in the simulation programme ATPDraw. The models were used for testing of various fault scenarios in combination with different system neutral earthing methods, line design and ground conductivity. It was found that presence of overhead <b>ground</b> <b>wires</b> does not have decisive impact on whether the distance relays are able to detect a single ground fault in a solid earthed grid. However, estimated fault location was severely improved for lines with <b>ground</b> <b>wires</b> compared to those without. Fault resistance was found to be the factor deciding whether a ground fault was detected. For a solid <b>earthed</b> grid lacking <b>ground</b> <b>wires,</b> high <b>earth</b> potential rise at fault location during a ground fault is a concern. The distance relays are displaying a clear difference in measured impedance for one ground fault versus two ground faults. Thus, in theory, {{it should be possible to}} implement more advanced protection zones that will only trip the relay for double faults and persistent single faults. However, this subject needs further analysis before a general conclusion applicable to all possible fault scenarios can be stated...|$|R

Such cable combines the functions of grounding and communications. An OPGW cable contains a tubular structure with one or more optical fibers in it, surrounded by layers of steel and aluminum wire. The OPGW cable is run between the tops of high-voltage electricity pylons. The conductive part of the cable serves to bond adjacent towers to <b>earth</b> <b>ground,</b> and shields the high-voltage conductors from lightning strikes. The optical fibers within the cable can be used for high-speed transmission of data, either for the electrical utility's own purposes of protection and control of the transmission line, for the utility's own voice and data communication, or may be leased or sold to third parties to serve as a high-speed fiber interconnection between cities.|$|R
