50|$|<b>Geographic</b> <b>balance</b> {{has played}} an {{important}} part of politics since the beginning. Before the civil war, a northern candidate was almost always paired with a southern running mate or vice versa. Since the civil war, this level of geographical balancing is less critical, but still plays a big role. In modern times, voters in the south, midwest, and Rocky mountain region of America are less inclined to support northeasterners and Californians without some sort of <b>geographic</b> <b>balance</b> and vice versa.|$|R

50|$|In early 1914, Interstate Commerce Commission {{commissioner}} Charles A.

This, in combination with the death in November 1913 of commissioner John Hobart Marble of California following an attack of acute indigestion, gave President Woodrow Wilson two seats to fill on the Commission. Wilson selected Winthrop More Daniels of New Jersey to fill Marble's seat, and Hall to fill Prouty's. This preserved the <b>geographic</b> <b>balance</b> on the Commission.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the efforts}} to achieve <b>geographic</b> <b>balance,</b> {{nineteen}} states have never produced a Supreme Court Justice. Some states have been over-represented (although partly because there were fewer states from which early justices could be appointed), with New York producing fifteen justices, Ohio producing ten, Massachusetts nine, Virginia eight, six each from Pennsylvania and Tennessee, and five from Kentucky, Maryland, and New Jersey. A handful of justices were born outside the United States, mostly from among the earliest justices on the Court. These included James Wilson, born in Fife, Scotland; James Iredell, born in Lewes, England; and William Paterson, born in County Antrim, Ireland. Justice David Josiah Brewer was born farthest from the U.S., in Smyrna, in the Ottoman Empire, (now İzmir, Turkey). George Sutherland was born in Buckinghamshire, England. The last foreign-born Justice, {{and the only one}} of these for whom English was a second language, was Felix Frankfurter, born in Vienna, Austria.
