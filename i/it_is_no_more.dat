5|$|Fra Mauro {{is thought}} to have been formed from ejecta, or debris, from the impact which formed Mare Imbrium. During Apollo 14, the crew members sampled ejecta from Cone crater, a feature close in {{proximity}} to the immediate landing site of the mission, which provided insight into the composition of material deep inside the formation. Data from the mission has helped to determine the approximate age of Mare Imbrium, suggesting that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than about 4.25 billion years old.|$|E
5|$|The {{return of}} royal burials to Thebes {{after the end}} of the Amarna period marks a change to the layout of royal burials, with the {{intermediate}} 'jogged axis' gradually giving way to the 'straight axis' of later dynasties. In the Western Valley, there is a tomb commencement that is thought to have been started for Akhenaten, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than a gateway and a series of steps. The tomb of Ay, Tutankhamun's successor is close by. It is likely that this tomb was started for Tutankhamun (its decoration is of a similar style) but later usurped for Ay's burial. This would mean that KV62 may have been Ay's original tomb, which would explain the smaller size and unusual layout for a royal tomb.|$|E
25|$|By 1944, all forty {{volumes of}} the First Encyclopedia of Tlön are {{discovered}} and published in a library in Memphis. The material then becomes accessible worldwide, and immensely influential on Earth's culture, science and languages. By the time Borges concludes the story, presumably in 1947, the world is gradually disintegrating and transforming into Tlön. Borges then turns to an obsession of his own: a translation of Sir Thomas Browne's Urn Burial into Spanish.

25|$|Completed after Christmas 1949 and {{published}} on 15 October 1951, Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia {{tells the story}} of the Pevensie children's second trip to Narnia. They are drawn back by the power of Susan's horn, blown by Prince Caspian to summon help in his hour of need. Narnia, as they knew <b>it,</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more,</b> as 1,300 years have passed and their castle is in ruins, while all Narnians have retreated so far within themselves that only Aslan's magic can wake them. Caspian has fled into the woods to escape his uncle, Miraz, who has usurped the throne. The children set out once again to save Narnia.|$|E
25|$|The {{inspiration}} for Thrushcross Grange {{has long been}} traced to Ponden Hall, near Haworth, which is very small. Shibden Hall, near Halifax, is perhaps more likely. The Thrushcross Grange that Emily describes is rather unusual. It sits within an enormous park, as does Shibden Hall. By comparison, the park at Chatsworth (the home of the Duke of Devonshire) is over two miles (3.2km) long but, as the house sits near the middle, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than {{a mile and a}} half (2.4km) from the lodge to the house. Considering that Edgar Linton apparently does not even have a title, this seems unlikely. There is no building close to Haworth that has a park anywhere near this size, but there are a few houses that might have inspired some elements. Shibden Hall has several features that match descriptions in the novel.|$|E
25|$|Searle {{offers a}} variant of his Chinese room argument, calling it the Chess Room Argument, where instead of {{answering}} questions in Chinese, the man in a room is playing chess. Or rather, as Searle explains, he is inside the room manipulating symbols which are meaningless to him, while his actions result in winning chess games outside the room. Searle concludes that like a computer, the man has no understanding of chess. Searle compares Deep Blue's victory to {{the manner in which}} a pocket calculator can beat humans at arithmetic; he adds that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> significant than a steel robot which is too tough for human beings to tackle during a game of American football. Kurzweil counters that the very same argument could be made of the human brain, since the individual neurons have no true understanding of the bigger problem the brain is working on but, added together, they produce what is known as consciousness.|$|E

25|$|First-line {{treatments}} {{currently used}} include PEG IFN, entecavir, and tenofovir, subject to patient and physician preference. Treatment initiation {{is guided by}} recommendations issued by The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) {{and is based on}} detectable viral levels, HBeAg positive or negative status, ALT levels, and in certain cases, family history of HCC and liver biopsy. In patients with compensated cirrhosis, treatment is recommended regardless of HBeAg status or ALT level, but recommendations differ regarding HBV DNA levels; AASLD recommends treating at DNA levels detectable above 2x103 IU/mL; EASL and WHO recommend treating when HBV DNA levels are detectable at any level. In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, treatment and evaluation for liver transplantation are recommended in all cases if HBV DNA is detectable. Currently, multidrug treatment is not recommended in treatment of chronic HBV as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> effective in the long term than individual treatment with entecavir or tenofovir.|$|E
500|$|During his {{lifetime}} Disraeli's opponents, {{and sometimes even}} his friends and allies, questioned whether he sincerely held the views he propounded, or whether they were adopted by him as essential to one who sought to spend his life in politics, and were mouthed by him without conviction. Lord John Manners, in 1843 {{at the time of}} Young England, wrote, [...] "could I only satisfy myself that D'Israeli believed all that he said, I should be more happy: his historical views are quite mine, but does he believe them?" [...] Blake (writing in 1966) suggested that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> possible to answer that question now than it was then. Nevertheless, Paul Smith, in his journal article on Disraeli's politics, argues that Disraeli's ideas were coherently argued over a political career of nearly half a century, and [...] "it is impossible to sweep them aside as a mere bag of burglar's tools for effecting felonious entry to the British political pantheon." ...|$|E
500|$|Star charts of {{that period}} labeled it as the Little Cloud. In 1612, the German {{astronomer}} Simon Marius gave an early description of the Andromeda Galaxy based on telescopic observations. The German philosopher Immanuel Kant in 1755 in his work Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens conjectured that the blurry spot was an island universe. In 1764, Charles Messier cataloged Andromeda as object M31 and incorrectly credited Marius as the discoverer despite it being {{visible to the naked}} eye. In 1785, the astronomer William Herschel noted a faint reddish hue in the core region of Andromeda. He believed Andromeda to be the nearest of all the [...] "great nebulae", and based on the color and magnitude of the nebula, he incorrectly guessed that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than 2,000 times the distance of Sirius. In 1850, William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, saw and made the first drawing of Andromeda's spiral structure.|$|E

500|$|Against all expectations, the war {{continued}} for five years. During this period, PedroII's {{time and energy}} were devoted to the war effort. He tirelessly worked to raise and equip troops to reinforce the front lines and to push forward the fitting of new warships for the navy. The rape of women, widespread violence against civilians, ransacking and destruction of properties that had occurred during Paraguay's invasion of Brazilian territory had made a deep impression on him. He warned the Countess of Barral in November 1866 that [...] "the war should be concluded as honor demands, cost what it cost." [...] "Difficulties, setbacks, and war-weariness {{had no effect on}} his quiet resolve", said Barman. Mounting casualties did not distract him from advancing what he saw as Brazil's righteous cause, and he stood prepared to personally sacrifice his own throne to gain an honorable outcome. Writing in his journal a few years previously PedroII remarked: [...] "What sort of fear could I have? That they take the government from me?

2500|$|A more {{controversial}} {{question is whether}} the Wall is visible from low Earth orbit (an altitude of as little as [...] ). NASA claims that it is barely visible, and only under nearly perfect conditions; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> conspicuous than many other man-made objects. Other authors have argued that due to limitations of the optics of the eye and the spacing of photoreceptors on the retina, it is impossible to see the wall with the naked eye, even from low orbit, and would require visual acuity of 20/3 (7.7 times better than normal).|$|E
2500|$|In modern presses, a die strikes {{approximately}} 120 coins a minute. This is a {{large number}} of coins produced in a short time, and obviously the die cannot last forever. However, the process of wearing the die is only hastened by the metals used in coins. Nickel, one of the main metals used in today’s coins, is quite hard and causes wear quickly. Copper has been used for centuries because of its malleability and the ease with which it makes coins. However, it too wears the dies when they are used for too long. An infamous example is the 1955 [...] "poorman’s double die." [...] This coin is sold as a replacement for the 1955 doubled die cent, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than Die Deterioration Doubling, caused by wear on the dies.|$|E

2500|$|There {{has been}} equally vehement {{opposition}} to Hirst's work. Norman Tebbit, {{commenting on the}} Sensation exhibition, wrote [...] "Have they gone stark raving mad? The works of the 'artist' are lumps of dead animals. There are thousands of young artists who didn't get a look in, presumably because their work was too attractive to sane people. Modern art experts never learn." [...] The view of the tabloid press was summed up by a Daily Mail headline: [...] "For 1,000 years art {{has been one of}} our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all." [...] The Evening Standard art critic, Brian Sewell, said simply, [...] "I don't think of it as art ... <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> interesting than a stuffed pike over a pub door.

2500|$|In quantum mechanics, the {{particle}} {{in a box}} model (also known as the infinite potential well or the infinite square well) describes a particle free to move in a small space surrounded by impenetrable barriers. [...] The model is mainly used as a hypothetical example to illustrate the differences between classical and quantum systems. [...] In classical systems, for example, a ball trapped inside a large box, {{the particle}} can move at any speed within the box and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> {{likely to be found}} at one position than another. However, when the well becomes very narrow (on the scale of a few nanometers), quantum effects become important. [...] The particle may only occupy certain positive energy levels. [...] Likewise, it can never have zero energy, meaning that the particle can never [...] "sit still". [...] Additionally, it {{is more likely to be}} found at certain positions than at others, depending on its energy level.

2500|$|Scalia {{argued that}} the {{plurality}} had not created new procedural protections for the First Amendment, [...] "but rather new First Amendment rights".

[...] "A category of employee speech is certainly not being 'retaliated against' if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> and no less subject to being mistaken for a disciplinable infraction than is any other category of speech or conduct." [...] He found the procedural test [...] "doubly irrelevant" [...] since not only had the plurality found the hospital to have satisfied it, they then remanded the case so the district court could conduct a trial on whether the speech was a pretext for a retaliatory firing.
