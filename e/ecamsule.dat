50|$|L'Oréal {{patented}} <b>ecamsule</b> {{first in}} 1982. It was approved in the EU in 1991. Sunscreens based on <b>ecamsule</b> {{have been available}} in Europe, Canada {{and other parts of}} the world since 1993. <b>Ecamsule</b> was given approval by the FDA in 2006 to be used in the U.S. However this approval only extends to <b>ecamsule</b> containing sunscreens registered under a New Drug Application, not <b>ecamsule</b> itself.|$|E
50|$|A 5% <b>ecamsule</b> {{containing}} sunscreen {{can prevent}} early changes leading to photoaging in humans. A broad spectrum sunscreen with <b>ecamsule,</b> avobenzone and octocrylene significantly reduces the skin damage associated with UV exposure in human subjects.|$|E
5000|$|Mexoryl SX (USAN <b>Ecamsule,</b> INCI Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid) ...|$|E
50|$|Drometrizole trisiloxane (INCI) is a {{lipophilic}} benzotriazole derivative {{marketed as}} Mexoryl XL by L'Oréal {{and is used}} in sunscreens to absorb UV radiation. It is a broad-spectrum UV absorber with two absorption peaks, one at 303 nm (UVB) and one at 344 nm (UVA). Just like Mexoryl SX (<b>ecamsule),</b> it is used exclusively in products by L'Oréal owned brands. Drometrizole trisiloxane and <b>ecamsule</b> are often used together, because they show a synergistic effect in protection.|$|E
50|$|Exposed to UV, <b>ecamsule</b> {{undergoes}} reversible photoisomerization, {{followed by}} photoexcitation. The absorbed UV is then released as thermal energy, without penetrating the skin.|$|E
50|$|UVB rays cause {{short-term}} sunburn {{and skin}} cancer; UVA rays cause wrinkling {{and may have}} some role in development of skin cancer. There is no official rating for UVA protection in the US. In Europe, there are several different rating systems {{that are used to}} measure effectiveness in blocking UVA rays, including the IPD (immediate pigment darkening assay) and the PPD (persistent pigment darkening assay). The UVB range is 280 to 320 nanometers, and the UVA range is 320 to 400. <b>Ecamsule</b> protects against UV wavelengths in the 290-400 nanometer range, with peak protection at 345 nm. Since <b>ecamsule</b> doesn't cover the entire UV spectrum, it should be combined with other active sunscreen agents to ensure broad-spectrum UV protection. <b>Ecamsule</b> is a photostable organic UVA absorber, meaning it doesn't degrade significantly when exposed to light. This is in contrast to the widely used UVA absorber avobenzone that is not intrinsically photostable and requires photostabilizers to prevent significant degradation in light.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>ecamsule</b> is an acid {{it needs}} to be {{neutralized}} in order to be used without offsetting the final pH of the sunscreen too much. Usually this is done with triethanolamine.|$|E
50|$|In {{studies done}} in mice {{it reduces the}} {{formation}} of UV induced pyrimidine dimers and delays the onset of skin cancer. In vitro <b>ecamsule</b> effectively protects against {{the harmful effects of}} UV.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ecamsule</b> {{has little}} {{percutaneous}} absorption and little systemic effects, {{therefore it is}} considered relatively safe. A mouse study shows {{that it does not}} increase the probability of promoting skin cancer. Studies done in vitro show that it is not photomutagenic.|$|E
