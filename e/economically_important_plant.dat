5|$|The {{history of}} botanical gardens is {{closely linked to}} the history of botany itself. The botanical gardens of the 16th and 17th centuries were {{medicinal}} gardens, but the idea of a botanical garden changed to encompass displays of the beautiful, strange, new and sometimes <b>economically</b> <b>important</b> <b>plant</b> trophies being returned from the European colonies and other distant lands. Later, in the 18th century, they became more educational in function, demonstrating the latest plant classification systems devised by botanists working in the associated herbaria as they tried to order these new treasures. Then, in the 19th and 20th centuries, the trend was towards a combination of specialist and eclectic collections demonstrating many aspects of both horticulture and botany.|$|E
25|$|Grasses are, {{in human}} terms, {{perhaps the most}} <b>{{economic}}ally</b> <b>important</b> <b>plant</b> family. Their economic importance stems from several areas, including food production, industry, and lawns. They have been grown as food for domesticated animals for up to 6,000 years and the grains of grasses such as wheat, rice, maize (corn) and barley {{have been the most}} important human food crops. Grasses are also used in the manufacture of thatch, paper, fuel, clothing, insulation, timber for fencing, furniture, scaffolding and construction materials, floor matting, sports turf and baskets.|$|E

5000|$|AYP is an <b>economically</b> <b>important</b> <b>plant</b> {{pathogen}} both {{in agricultural}} and nursery industries. A 25% reduction in carrot yield is common, with losses reaching 80% on occasion. [...] AYP causes symptoms {{that make the}} infected carrots unmarketable. In processed carrots, the presence of 15% of aster yellows-infected carrots results in {{a rejection of the}} entire product due to their distasteful flavor. [...] The deformation of flowers and reproductive structures causes seed not to form. This can be a problem in crops grown for seed for replanting purposes, or for consumption, such as coriander or caraway. [...] Root stunting can also result in loss of biannual crops over winter.|$|E
