Among these was included the 1751 prose rendering by Anne-Marie du Boccage already mentioned. The first German-language Brief der Eloise an den Abelard, published anonymously in 1760, was in fact based on Colardeau’s translation, the French text of which appeared opposite the German alexandrines. Several more translations from the original English followed, though they were of varying quality. Between 1779-1804 no less than ten appeared in both verse and prose. Two of the most prominent, by Gottfried August Bürger and Johann Joachim Eschenburg, were frequently published, in some cases together, both from German and from Austrian presses. Burger’s Heloise an Abelard, more an improvisation than a translation, was followed in its Swiss edition (Zurich 1803) by Pope’s original; from the same press in 1804 appeared J. Rothstein’s <b>free</b> <b>prose</b> version, accompanied by Colardeau’s French translation and Pope’s poem as well.|$|E

The RASE technology has been tested on following three categories of documents: standard (case: NS 11001 - 1.

40|$|Art Based Inquiry: Exploring Metaphors and Felt Sensations Through the Process of SoulCollage Sarah Helen Epp This arts based {{research}} paper explores {{the intersection of}} SoulCollage, metaphors, and felt sensations within an art therapy context. Art therapy is a “set of interpersonal and art-based skills used to help people {{come to terms with}} psychological, developmental, social, and behavioral stressors that impede their health and wellbeing” (Kapitan, 2014, p. 30). A primary aim of art therapy is image creation followed by reflective critique as a means to enhance insight and promote psychological wellbeing. SoulCollage is an artistic modality developed by Seena Frost (2001, 2010 a); in brief, SoulCollage processes utilize the transformative power of collaging as a method for identifying and engaging aspects of one’s psyche. This research examines the relationship between the images, felt sensations within the body, and the generation of metaphors within an art therapy context. This arts based research is founded on the creation of one hundred SoulCollage cards and written reflections. The data creation {{is the result of a}} systematic process of making SoulCollage cards, followed by identifying and documenting felt sensations within the body. The process of imaginal dialogue, <b>free</b> <b>prose,</b> and poetry served as a tool to foster the creation of verbal metaphors. SoulCollage fosters the creation of verbal metaphors through utilizing the Cognitive and Symbolic components of the Expressive Therapies Continuum. This paper focuses on contextualizing the SoulCollage process through the lens of the Expressive Therapies Continuum and arts-based research methodologies. In addition, it provides the author’s exploration of metaphor and felt sensations within the body and their application in art therapy.

The lyrics of songs are typically of a poetic, rhyming nature, although they may be religious verses or <b>free</b> <b>prose.</b> The writer analyzed the bad language which was used by SUM 41 ’s lyrics. The purposes were to find the kinds of bad language, to know the types of bad languages {{and to find out}} the meanings of bad language which were found in SUM 41 ’s lyrics. The research design used was descriptive qualitative research. The subject of the study was bad languages used by SUM 41 ’s song lyrics entitled “ASSHOLE” and “March of the Dogs”. SUM 41 bands were selected as the subjects of the study because they often use bad languages in their lyrics. The writer used documentary observation as the instrument. The object was the lyrics of the songs. The findings of this analysis were divided into two. The first was the kinds of bad languages used by sum 41 ’s lyrics. They were swearing, slang, jargon, misuse and filler and small words. The second was the interpretation and the meaning of bad languages, they were expletive, abusive, humorous and auxiliary. In conclusion, the writer found that filler and small words, and misuse are the most dominant types of bad language which used in SUM 41 ’s lyrics. Abusive and humorous are the most dominant type of interpretation and meaning of bad language. There {{are still a lot of}} bad languages, the types and also the meaning and the interpretation of bad languages found in SUM 41 ’s lyrics, but the writer thinks that their lyrics is good to be learned as a source of bad languages. This analysis gives contribution to the study of sociolinguistics and can increase our knowledge about bad language...|$|E

In his exposition and exploration of characters he combines the attributes of two contrary geniuses - Shaw and Shakespeare.
