40|$|A {{total of}} 2261 (808 male, 1453 female) {{consecutive}} patients attending contact dermatitis clinics were patch tested to isoeugenol and its derivatives {{listed in the}} EU Inventory of Fragrance Ingredients. Positive reactions were found to isoeugenol in 40, transisoeugenol in 40, isoeugenyl acetate in 19, isoeugenyl benzoate in 4, <b>isoeugenyl</b> <b>phenylacetate</b> in 16, isoeugenyl methyl ether in 6 and benzyl isoeugenyl ether in 2 patients. There was a concomitant reaction to isoeugenol in 36 / 40 of those positive to transisoeugenol, 13 / 19 of those to isoeugenyl acetate, 3 / 4 of those to isoeugenyl benzoate and 15 / 16 of those to <b>isoeugenyl</b> <b>phenylacetate</b> but in none of those 6 positive to isoeugenyl methyl ether and in neither of those 2 positive to benzyl isoeugenyl ether. Concomitant contact allergy between isoeugenol and its derivatives may occur through chemical cross-reactivity or local skin metabolism of the derivatives. It is more commonly observed with the esters rather than the ethers. Isoeugenyl acetate has been proposed {{as an alternative to}} isoeugenol, but there is a high degree of concomitant reactivity with isoeugenol. status: publishe...|$|E
