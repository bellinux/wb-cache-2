50|$|The founders {{designed}} a small, low-powered, but fast, sporting monoplane, designated the Chilton D.W.1. The aircraft had a clean aerodynamic design, which required split flaps {{to lower the}} landing speed. The Carden Ford 32 h.p. gave it a <b>declared</b> top <b>speed</b> of 112 mph, but during racing, 129 mph was eventually reached.|$|R
5000|$|A {{companion}} {{event is}} the Thunderfest, first held in 2010. The events generally {{took place at}} Darley Moor but in 2015 it {{took place at the}} Mona Circuit. The event is a regularity trial where riders <b>declare</b> a target <b>speed</b> and then ride for 20 minutes plus two laps in an attempt to achieve it.|$|R
50|$|Both of {{his films}} in 2007 were action multi-starrers. Anubhav Sinha's Cash was {{originally}} meant to be the sequel to Dus, but ended up differently. Due to this, some of the cast of Dus also star in Cash. It performed reasonably well in its first week, {{but was unable to}} replicate the success of Dus and was eventually <b>declared</b> a flop. <b>Speed</b> also failed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Merak's three-litre engine produced [...] at 6000 rpm and [...] at 4000 rpm. Three twin-choke Weber carburettors (one 42 DCNF 31 and two 42 DCNF 32) fed the engine, and {{the compression}} ratio was 8.75:1. Maserati <b>declared</b> a top <b>speed</b> of over 240 km/h.Early Meraks (1972 to 1975) were fitted with Citroën SM's dashboard, characterized by oval instrument gauges inset in a brushed metal fascia and a single-spoke steering wheel. 630 were {{made up to}} 1974.|$|R
5000|$|The Artena's {{engine was}} a Tipo 84 Lancia V4 engine, with a {{one-piece}} cast iron cylinder block. A narrow angle of 17° between the cylinder banks kept the engine compact; all four cylinders' exhausts exited {{on the left}} hand side, while on the right there was a single Zenith downdraught carburettor. A chain-driven overhead camshaft operated two parallel poppet valves per cylinder.Bore and stroke measured respectively 82.55 and 90.0 mm, for a total displacement of maximum power was [...] at 4,000 rpm. Lancia <b>declared</b> a top <b>speed</b> of 115 km/h.Noteworthily the engine was not directly attached to the chassis, but rather suspended via two leaf springs in order to dampen vibrations.|$|R
5000|$|Street proves a {{formidable}} opponent. The two take turns knocking each other down. Eventually Chaney wins the grueling bout, {{but not before}} Street, {{on his hands and}} knees, refuses Gandil's demand that he use extraordinary means (a pair of brass cylinders) to avert defeat, sweeping them aside when they are placed on {{the ground in front of}} him. Instead, Street gamely staggers to his feet and goes down swinging. Speed's life is spared. True to his word, Chaney decides the time has come to move on. He gives Speed and Poe a generous cut of the winnings and walks alone towards the railroad tracks. As Chaney disappears into the darkness, <b>Speed</b> <b>declares,</b> [...] "He sure was something." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{companion}} {{event is}} the Thunderfest, first held in 2010. The events generally {{took place at}} Darley Moor but in 2015 it {{took place at the}} Anglesey Circuit. The event is a regularity trial where riders <b>declare</b> a target <b>speed</b> and then ride for 20 minutes plus two laps in an attempt to achieve it. The closeness to the target, not the actual speed, is the deciding factor. For example, a rider could declare a target of 61.15 mph and achieve 61.2mph. He would beat a rider who declared 70mph and then managed an average of 72mph. This leads to the situation where riders of smaller, slower bikes can beat bigger and faster machines. The time trial demands a high degree of skill, without the intensity of flat-out racing. The event has attracted a number of classic bikes and has proved popular with spectators.|$|R
30|$|Computational {{performance}} (column 6) {{are related}} to a C++ implementation and run on a PC equipped with an Intel 2.4 GHz dual-core processor and 4 GB of RAM; time required for disk loading/saving of range data is excluded. It {{is important to note}} that the code has not been fully optimized for parallel execution yet, hence there is room in this sense for further improvements of time performance. Computational performance shows an average alignment time of 2.5 s. As an example, time breakdown for the Hurricane dataset is distributed as follows: 57 % for feature extraction, 1 % for feature description, 32 % for feature matching, 8 % for correspondence skim and roto-translation estimation. Lightness of our feature signature is testified by the fact that the feature description step only takes 1 % of the total time. The two main factors that influence computation times are the number of points per range image to be processed, and the number of features detected over each image. In the “worst case” (that means, images close to 1 million of points and many features detected at all scales), alignment time reached a maximum of about 4 seconds. Comparisons of computational speed with respect to the literature is somehow difficult to infer since (1) not every work <b>declare</b> computational <b>speed,</b> (2) only isolated blocks of the alignment chain are usually considered (e.g. feature extraction) instead of the entire pipeline, (3) hardware obsolescence. Nevertheless, our computational time is at least one order of magnitude (comprising hardware obsolescence compensation) under the times declared in the related works [2, 19, 20, 22].|$|R
40|$|Heterogeneity of {{processor}} speed and time availability is {{introduced to the}} paradigm of load sharing {{among a number of}} autonomous and independently scheduled heterogeneous computers that communicate via a message-passing interconnection system. A divisible job originating at one of the system sites is to be partitioned and executed concurrently on a suite of selected processors, to the extent of the time and processing speed allocation that each computer offers for load sharing, in order to minimize job completion time. The originating computer, after invoking a poll-and-reserve loud sharing protocol to obtain the multiple-interval time constraints and corresponding processing <b>speeds</b> <b>declared</b> by each processor on load sharing at the time, uses the time and speed availability data to select an optimal suite of processors and load partitioning thereon which achieves the earliest completion time. The load is characterized as being arbitrarily divisible, a paradigm suitable for loads encountered in many applications including image processing, real-titne systems, and the processing of massive experimental data. An efficient algorithm for determining the optimal load partitioning is presented. ...|$|R
40|$|We study {{combinatorial}} optimization problems involving one-parameter selfish agents considered by Archer and Tardos [FOCS 2001]. In particular, we show that, if agents can lie {{in one direction}} (that is they either overbid or underbid) then *any* (polynomial-time) c-approximation algorithm, for the optimization problem without selfish agents, {{can be turned into}} a (polynomial-time) c(1 +ϵ) -approximation truthful mechanism, for any ϵ > 0. We then look at the Q||Cmax problem in the case of agents owning machines of different speeds. We consider the model in which payments are given to the agents only after the machines have completed the jobs assigned. This means that for each machine that receives at least one job, the mechanism can *verify* if the corresponding agent <b>declared</b> a greater <b>speed.</b> For this setting, we characterize the allocation algorithms A that admit a payment function P such that M=(A,P) is a truthful mechanism. In addition, we give a (1 +ϵ) -approximation truthful mechanism for Q||Cmax when machine speeds are bounded by a constant. Finally, we consider the classical scheduling problem Q|| w_jC_j which does not admit an exact mechanism if verification is not allowed. By contrast, we show that an exact mechanism for Q|| w_jC_j exists when verification is allowed...|$|R
5000|$|Sogō {{devised a}} plan to make it almost {{impossible}} {{for the government to}} withdraw its support, once given. Central to Sogo's strategy was the use of a loan from the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development (World Bank). This was apparently an idea put to him by future Prime Minister and then Minister of Finance, Eisaku Satō, who had previously worked with Sogō in the Railway Ministry. With the successful application for a $80 million loan (estimated to be no more than 15 {{percent of the cost of}} the line) in place, it ensured that the Japanese government had to remain committed to the project. At the same time, Sogō, who had kept estimated cost figures of the Tōkaidō Shinkansen deliberately low for fear that if they were too high neither the Japanese Government nor the World Bank would have supported the proposal, began to divert money from other JNR projects to the construction of the Shinkansen. This was possible because once JNR's total budget was approved by the Diet, the JNR president had [...] "discretionary authority" [...] over how to spend it. Sogo also kept down the <b>declared</b> maximum proposed <b>speed</b> at a relatively modest 200 km/h and argued successfully that this was not a new line but expansion of the existing Tōkaidō Line.|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we will attempt to analyse the {{dialectic}} relation of European economic integration under the prism of the European Union public finance. The course of European integration will be examined via the Community Budget. The vital question in our selected subject, seeking for a persuasive answer, is the relation of economic completion and unequal growth. It is, as we will prove, an ambiguous phenomenon. This ambiguity is consisted {{in the fact that}} the European integration process is developed in the base of social oppositions and is determined by the objecting interests of capital and labour. It is impossible to comprehend the European economic and political integration, outside the process of production internationalisation and supranational mechanisms of social classes regulation. In order to enlighten the relation between economy and policy, it is necessary to present extensively the public finances of the Union. Thus, we can achieve the necessary mediation between the European completion and the E. U. budgetary policy. For all the above reasons, we will proceed in a comparative analysis of the Community budget and that of the member states of the E. U. Furthermore, we will proceed to an analytic sectoral structure of the Community budget, where important redeployments in the Community financing are observed. Policies recede, like the Common Rural Policy, and policies are found in rise, as for example the European Regional Policy. We will emphasize in the critical question: how it is possible for the EU, having a budget which hardly comes to the 1 % of the GNP of the European Union, to face the problem of regional inequalities, when the national budgets of the member states do usually exceed the 50 % of GNP? We will mention the failure of the Intergovernmental Conference for the approval of the European Constitution (Brussels 2003) and the letter sent to the Community Chairman by « 6 » wealthy countries (Germany, France, Great Britain, Holland, Sweden, Austria) countries, which, as a rule, are supporting the Structural Funds of the Union. These countries request to reduce the Community Budget at the 0, 8 % of European GNP. Our discussion therefore is focused in the relation of the rich North and the poor South. In general, the rich countries, especially after the wreck of Intergovernmental Conference <b>declare</b> the “two <b>speeds</b> Europe”, wishing obviously to “punish” some poor countries like Poland. At this point, is also situated the interest of our own approach. The Community Budget investigation and in extension, his as much as possible increase, can confront the problems of unequal growth and bring a solution to the regional problem in the EU 25. The “hard core” of the EU is in opposition to this perspective and counter proposes a “two speeds Europe”. The future seems uncertain. ...|$|R
