5|$|During the Hellenistic period, mythology {{took on the}} {{prestige}} of elite knowledge that marks its possessors as belonging to a certain class. At the same time, the skeptical turn of the Classical age became even more pronounced. Greek mythographer Euhemerus established the tradition of seeking an actual historical basis for mythical beings and events. Although his original work (Sacred Scriptures) is lost, much is <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> from what is recorded by Diodorus and Lactantius.|$|E
5|$|The first kingdom's {{government}} {{consisted of}} the king (styled Malikum) and the grand vizier, who headed a council of elders (Abbu) and the administration. The second kingdom was a monarchy, but little is <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> {{because of a lack}} of written records. The third kingdom was a city-state monarchy with reduced importance under the authority of Yamhad.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{and humans}} are both {{primates}}. Ancestral primates had brown eyes, as most primates do today. The genetic basis of blue eyes in humans {{has been studied}} in detail and much is <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> It {{is not the case}} that one gene locus is responsible, say with brown dominant to blue eye color. However, a single locus is responsible for about 80% of the variation. In lemurs, the difference(s) between blue and brown eyes are not completely known, but the same gene locus is not involved.|$|E

5|$|Although the Greeks and Romans {{did much}} to advance water clock technology, they still {{continued}} to use shadow clocks. The mathematician and astronomer Theodosius of Bithynia, for example, {{is said to have}} invented a universal sundial that was accurate anywhere on Earth, though little is <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Others wrote of the sundial in the mathematics and literature of the period. Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, the Roman author of De Architectura, wrote on the mathematics of gnomons, or sundial blades. During the reign of Emperor Augustus, the Romans constructed the largest sundial ever built, the Solarium Augusti. Its gnomon was an obelisk from Heliopolis. Similarly, the obelisk from Campus Martius was used as the gnomon for Augustus's zodiacal sundial. Pliny the Elder records that the first sundial in Rome arrived in 264, looted from Catania, Sicily; according to him, it gave the incorrect time until the markings and angle appropriate for Rome's latitude were used—a century later.|$|E
5|$|Hiroshi tells Hsing {{that he and}} {{a handful}} of allies, who believe that the people on the ship should stop at Hsin Ti Chiu, have been keeping news of the {{acceleration}} secret. They believe that hiding the knowledge of the schedule provides them a weapon against the angels, who do not wish the ship to stop at all. Hsing becomes a reluctant party to the conspiracy, but is distressed by its secrecy and what she considers to be dishonesty, and persuades Hiroshi and his allies to go public with the information. Meanwhile, Luis thoroughly investigates the education program for the sixth generation aboard the ship (the generation supposed to land on Hsin Ti Chiu) and finds that large parts of it have been erased or replaced with propaganda by the angels. Luis succeeds in making the ruling council of the ship launch an investigation into religious manipulation of the education program. Persuaded by Hsing, Hiroshi makes a public statement about the ship's new schedule, while concealing {{the fact that he had}} <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> for a while.|$|E
5|$|The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 {{replaced}} the wartime Manhattan Project with the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) on January 1, 1947. The Act also established the General Advisory Committee (GAC) within the AEC {{to provide it}} with scientific and technical advice. It was widely expected that Conant would chair the GAC, but the position went to Robert Oppenheimer, the wartime director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory that had designed and developed the first atomic bombs. At the same time, the Joint Research and Development Board (JRDC) was established to coordinate defense research, and Bush asked Conant to head its atomic energy subcommittee, on which Oppenheimer also served. When the new AEC chairman David E. Lilienthal raised security concerns about Oppenheimer's relationships with communists, including Oppenheimer's brother Frank Oppenheimer, his wife Kitty and his former girlfriend Jean Tatlock, Bush and Conant reassured Lilienthal that they had <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> when they had placed Oppenheimer in charge at Los Alamos in 1942. With such expressions of support, AEC issued Oppenheimer a Q clearance, granting him access to atomic secrets.|$|E

5|$|There is {{a general}} rule that a {{landlord}} who leases a property is not liable for nuisances created after the occupier takes control of the land. There is an exception where the lease is granted for a purpose which constitutes a nuisance, as in Tetley v Chitty, or where the nuisance is caused by their failure to repair the premises, as in Wringe v Cohen. The landlord is also liable were the nuisance existed before the land was let, and he knew or ought to have <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Under the principle of vicarious liability, an occupier of land can also be liable {{for the actions of}} their employees; in Matania v National Provincial Bank, it was also established that they could be liable for the activities of independent contractors under certain circumstances.|$|E

500|$|In {{comments}} a {{week after}} this reading, Baraka was quoted by New Jersey's largest newspaper The Star-Ledger: [...] "The Israelis <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> just like Bush <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> just like the Germans <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> just like the French <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Bush couldn’t hope for a better legitimization of his {{trying to make the}} Middle East a gas station." [...] Despite this, Baraka denies that his poem is anti-Semitic pointing to the accusation in the poem's text which he claims is directed only against Israelis rather than Jews as a people. The Anti-Defamation League denounced the poem as antisemitic and have pointed to several examples of a long pattern of anti-Semitism in his work and public statements though Baraka and his defenders defined his position as Anti-Zionism.|$|R

25|$|The {{appearance}} of the megamouth is distinctive, but little else is <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> It has a brownish-black colour on top, is white underneath, and has an asymmetrical tail with a long upper lobe, {{similar to that of}} the thresher shark. The interior of its gill slits are lined with finger-like gill rakers that capture its food. A relatively poor swimmer, the megamouth has a soft, flabby body and lacks caudal keels. The megamouth is considerably less active than the other filter-feeding sharks, the basking shark and the whale shark. The megamouth has a stout body and a long, wide bulbous head.|$|E
25|$|According to legend, {{ancestors}} of today's Oromo {{people in a}} region of Kaffa in Ethiopia were {{believed to have been}} the first to recognize the energizing effect of the coffee plant, though no direct evidence has been found indicating where in Africa coffee grew or who among the native populations might have used it as a stimulant or even <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> earlier than the 17th century. The story of Kaldi, the 9th-century Ethiopian goatherd who discovered coffee when he noticed how excited his goats became after eating the beans from a coffee plant, did not appear in writing until 1671 and is probably apocryphal.|$|E
25|$|The Ethiopian {{ancestors}} of today's Oromo ethnic group {{were the first}} to have recognized the energizing effect of the native coffee plant. Studies of genetic diversity have been performed on Coffea arabica varieties, which were found to be of low diversity but with retention of some residual heterozygosity from ancestral materials, and closely related diploid species Coffea canephora and C. liberica; however, no direct evidence has ever been found indicating where in Africa coffee grew or who among the natives might have used it as a stimulant or <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> there earlier than the seventeenth century. The original domesticated coffee plant {{is said to have been}} from Harar, and the native population is thought to be derived from Ethiopia with distinct nearby populations in Sudan and Kenya.|$|E
