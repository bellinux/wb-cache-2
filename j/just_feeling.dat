500|$|While {{working on}} Beyoncé's fifth studio album, {{frequent}} collaborator Timbaland played Jay-Z the instrumental {{for what would}} become [...] "Picasso Baby". According to Jay-Z, that song built {{the sound of the}} album. Jay-Z and Timbaland had grown apart after they worked on The Blueprint 3, but reunited for this album. Timbaland ended up handling the majority of the production on Magna Carta Holy Grail. In an interview with BBC Radio 1, Jay-Z stated that while the two have recorded many songs in the past, it was not until Magna Carta Holy Grail that they got the chemistry to collaborate for a whole project. Producer J-Roc described [...] "Picasso Baby" [...] as [...] "just New York". He told XXL that him and Timbaland [...] "were really <b>just</b> <b>feeling</b> the city, the energy that it gives out" [...] and were inspired by the [...] "numerous different cultures and different dialects or sounds." ...|$|E

500|$|Furtado {{embarked}} on a world concert tour, the Get Loose Tour, on 16 February 2007 in the UK, {{in support of the}} album; the tour included thirty-one dates in Europe and Canada, with additional shows in the US, Japan, Australia and Latin America. Furtado described the show as a [...] "full sensory experience" [...] with [...] "a beginning, middle and end ... takes you on a journey", also stressing the importance of crowd involvement and [...] "spontaneity and rawness, because those are my roots, you know? I started by doing club shows, and that's the energy I love, the raw club energy of <b>just</b> <b>feeling</b> like you're rocking out." [...] Though Furtado said choreographed dance routines were {{to be included in the}} show, she described it as [...] "music-based ...

500|$|For {{the final}} scene with Daenerys Targaryen {{emerging}} from the great fire of the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen, the filming took place in two different locations, with the close ups of Emilia Clarke taking place on a closed set in Belfast, and the large-scale set shots taking place in Spain. In an interview, Clarke had previously indicated she had become reluctant to do nude scenes unless it served the plot. After the episode aired, Clarke made a point to indicate {{that it was not}} a body double in {{the final scene}} of the episode, stating, [...] "I'd like to remind people the last time I took my clothes off was season 3. That was awhile ago. It's now season 6. But this is all me, all proud, all strong. I'm <b>just</b> <b>feeling</b> genuinely happy I said 'Yes.' That ain't no body double!"

500|$|In November 2011, Marvel {{announced}} that Alan Silvestri, who scored Captain America: The First Avenger, would write and compose the score for The Avengers. Silvestri said, [...] "I've worked on films where {{there have been}} a number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film, but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world and it's a very different situation. It's very challenging to look for a way to give everyone the weight and consideration they need, but at the same time the film is really about the coming together of these characters, which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers which really has to be representative of all of them together." [...] Silvestri developed the score with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London, England. Whedon said, [...] "The score is very old-fashioned, which is why [...] was letter-perfect for this movie because he can give you the heightened emotion, the [...] school of 'I'm <b>just</b> <b>feeling</b> a lot right now!' but he can also be extraordinarily cue and character specific, which I love." ...|$|E

500|$|Kulwicki {{started his}} rookie season in 1986 with Terry. After Terry decided to end support for his racing team mid-season, Kulwicki fielded his own team. He started out as {{essentially}} a one-man team {{in a time when}} other teams had dozens of people in supporting roles. Initially the driver, owner, crew chief, and chief mechanic, Kulwicki had difficulty acquiring and keeping crew members because he found it difficult to trust them to do the job with the excellence that he demanded, and because he was hands on in the maintenance of racecars {{to the point of being}} a [...] "control freak". He sought out crew members who had owned their own racecars, believing they would understand what he was going through: working long hours and performing his own car maintenance with a very limited budget. Notable crew members include his crew chief, Paul Andrews, and future Cup crew chiefs, Tony Gibson and Brian Whitesell. Future crew chief and owner, Ray Evernham, lasted sixweeks with Kulwicki in 1992. Evernham later said, [...] "The man was a genius. There's no question. It's not a matter of people <b>just</b> <b>feeling</b> like he was a genius. That man was a genius. But his personality paid for that. He was very impatient, very straightforward, very cut-to-the-bone." [...] With onecar, twoengines, and twofull-time crew members, Kulwicki won the 1986 Winston Cup Rookie of the Year award. He had competed in 23 of 29events, with fourtop10 finishes, three races not completed (DNF), an average finish of 15.4, and had only one result below 30th place. Kulwicki finished 21st in the Winston Cup points standings for the season.|$|E
2500|$|According to Gomez, one of {{the main}} inspirations behind the track was the body-shaming she dealt with from tabloids and social media, after photos {{surfaced}} online of the singer in a bikini during a trip to Mexico in April 2015. [...] Many claimed she gained weight, with some news outlets going as far as to label her a [...] "mess", and suggested Gomez was [...] "going off the deep end". She commented: [...] "I was getting a lot of hate for my body and ‘you’re gaining weight,’ and so I was in Mexico and I was <b>just</b> <b>feeling</b> all of this stuff and I would be lying to you if I said it didn’t kind of hurt my feelings, but I kind of channeled that into my music." [...] Gomez called the experience [...] "degrading", explaining that she had never been through intense bullying before.|$|E
2500|$|Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, while enjoying Modern Times, {{felt that}} it was [...] "not one of those infrequent, {{unequivocally}} fantastic Dylan albums" [...] and ridiculed the lavish praise heaped on the album, writing: [...] "It's hard to hear the music of Modern Times over the inevitable standing ovation and the thuds of middle-aged critics swooning in awe." [...] Jim DeRogatis of the Chicago Sun-Times appreciated the lyrical content but found fault in the languid music, writing that [...] "with the exception of the closing track 'Ain't Talkin', one of the spookiest songs he's ever written, Dylan disappoints with... inexplicable fondness for smarmy '30s and '40s balladry". Some reviewers who liked the album were critical of its musicianship, such as the Chicago Tribunes Greg Kot, as well as Jon Pareles of The New York Times, who wrote that [...] "onstage Mr. Dylan's touring band regularly supercharges his songs. But on Modern Times the musicians play as if they’re <b>just</b> <b>feeling</b> their way into the tunes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rolling Stones Kirk Miller wrote that: [...] "...thanks to the song's digital beats, clean metal-guitar riffs, {{scattered}} {{piano lines}} and all-too-familiar mix of rapping and singing", [...] "it {{was similar to}} Linkin Park's material. Nick Catucci of The Village Voice found [...] "...piano tinkles, Lee's breathless keen, dramatic pauses, guitars like clouds of locusts, [...] 12 Stones singer Paul McCoy's passing-12-kidney-stones guest vocals." [...] Vik Bansal of musicOMH compared Evanescence's own song [...] "Going Under" [...] with [...] "Bring Me to Life", noting their similarity to Linkin Park's material. Lee said, during an interview with MTV News: [...] "Basically, we go through life every day, kind of doing the same thing, going through the motions, and nothing fazes us for the most part. Then one day something happens that wakes [...] up and makes [...] realize that there's {{more to life than}} <b>just</b> <b>feeling</b> nothing, feeling numb.

2500|$|The first {{promotion}} {{was considered}} to be very successful. Rosen noted that they considered the million-dollar goal as a best-case scenario, but once the sale actually started, [...] "it was immediately clear that we were on to something". Rosen would later attribute part of the success to Ars Technica writer Mike Thomspon, stating that he [...] "immediately saw the potential" [...] of the Bundle in an article written for the website just prior to the Bundle's sale period. Brandon Boyer of Boing Boing believed that it provided a model that [...] "seems it could and should be repeated". The move to offer games in a price and manner that consumers were willing to buy was contrasted to larger software publishers that place artificial limitations on their content; Mike Masnick of Techdirt believed the Humble Bundle promotion worked as it [...] "focus on giving people real reasons to buy, rather than <b>just</b> <b>feeling</b> entitled to define the terms under which they buy and looking for ways to limit those who want to interact with you in a different manner". The source for the promotion's website has been requested of Wolfire by several other groups, according to Rosen; Rosen continues to believe that many similar charitable sales {{can be seen in the}} future from the Humble Bundle's success. For future Bundles, Rosen desires to include lesser-known titles in contrast to World of Goo and Braid, but has had to already reject some developers' requests to be included in a Bundle, claiming the games' quality may tarnish the Humble Indie Bundle branding. Instead, he believes smaller games with no wide profile and are [...] "legitimately good" [...] would be ideal for inclusion in future Bundles.|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Good for You" [...] is a torch {{song and}} a come-hither with themes of intensity, psychodrama, {{self-confidence}} and female self-empowerment, with Gomez singing the hook [...] "I just wanna {{look good for}} you, good for you", as a plea. According to the singer, the track [...] "reps women in a good way" [...] and [...] "does something to a woman when they look good". In an interview for People magazine, she stated: [...] "This song represents the confidence that I truly have inside of me, and I think it's the vulnerable side that I've expressed, but it's also the combination of <b>just</b> <b>feeling</b> myself". It was noted to showcase a shift towards more mature and sexually suggestive subject matter than in Gomez's previous releases. A number of the lyrics attribute syllables {{as a means of}} poetry, namely, [...] "leave this dress a mess on the floor" [...] and [...] "syncopate my skin to your heart beating". Gomez's lyrics specifically deal with pleasing and being the perfect complement for her significant other, by means of wearing skin-tight dresses and doing her [...] "hair up real, real nice". Gomez references the Greek myth of Midas and jewelry retailer Tiffany & Co in the lines [...] "Doing it up like Midas, mmm" [...] and [...] "I'm on marquise diamond / I'm a marquise diamond / Could even make that Tiffany jealous, mmm". Gomez's lyrics deal with pleasing her lover and being the perfect complement for him, seen in lyrics as [...] "Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight / Do my hair up real, real nice". The line [...] "You say I give it to you hard / So bad, so bad / Make you never wanna leave / I won't / I won't" [...] represents a shift towards more mature and sexually suggestive subject matter than Gomez's previous releases.|$|E

40|$|This article aims to {{contribute}} to the fields of emotional geographies and geographies of sexualities by exploring the relationship between emotions and gender, sexuality, and ‘race’ in sexualised night-time leisure spaces. By drawing on ethnographic research conducted in Manchester's Gay Village, the article highlights the importance of taking into account intersections of social identities when exploring how people feel in certain spaces. It explores how relations of ‘othering’ work through emotions, in particular how people are othered through feelings of comfort and safety. Whilst these feelings are triggered by a particular reading of bodies and spaces, they also produce bodies and spaces that are gendered, sexualised, and racialised (and classed). The article offers a rethinking of comfort and safety as not <b>just</b> <b>feelings</b> individuals have but as being constitutive of sexual, gender, and racial subjectivities and spaces...|$|R
