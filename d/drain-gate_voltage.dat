40|$|Abstract — This paper {{provides}} {{a new approach}} to evaluate the transistor safe operating area at nominal operating conditions which has been demonstrated on MESFET technology. It consists on performing on-state and off-state accelerated DC step stresses for bias conditions which can be reached by the Vds and Vgs sweeps in overdrive conditions. Both on-state and off-state stresses shown different degradation modes which {{can be attributed to the}} different stress bias conditions. On the one hand, the on-state stress corresponds to the impact ionization regime where the <b>drain-gate</b> <b>voltage</b> is considered as an accelerating factor for the device degradation. On the other hand, the off-state stress is performed for bias conditions which correspond to the gate leakage current regime in the reverse Igs-Vgs characteristics where the <b>drain-gate</b> <b>voltage</b> and the gate current are considered as an accelerating factor for the device degradation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} an S-band HPA MMIC in AlGaN/GaN CPW technology for radar TR-module application. The trade-offs of using an MMIC solution versus discrete power devices are discussed. The MMIC shows a {{maximum output power of}} 38 Watt at 37 % Power Added Efficiency at 3. 1 GHz. An output power of more than 20 Watt has been simulated from 2. 5 to 3. 7 GHz. The robustness against high output VSWR values up to 4 : 1 has been checked and simulations show a maximum <b>drain-gate</b> <b>voltage</b> of around 60 V...|$|E
40|$|This work brings new {{experimental}} data shedding {{light on the}} still controversial issue of o-state breakdown in microwave power FETs, which limits the power handling ca- pability. By means of measurements per- formed on AlGaAs/GaAs power HFETs {{in a wide range}} of temperatures, we show that: 1) At relatively low <b>drain-gate</b> <b>voltage,</b> the gate current comes from thermionic-eld emission. 2) As we approach o-state breakdown, im- pact ionization of electrons accelerated by the large drain-gate eld becomes the dominant mechanism originating the gate current. 3) For even higher values of the drain-gate volt age, both electrons and holes possibly ionize, and the drain-gate diode avalanches. Our experimental ndings diverge in some respects from other published data and rep- resent therefore a new contribution to the un- derstanding of this important issue...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first reported quarter-micron double delta doped AlGaAs/ InGaAs {{charge coupled device}} for microwave frequency filter applications. The design and fabrication of conventional and multi tapped delay line MMICs for RF filter applications are also discussed. The device is implemented as a recessed capacitive gate structure which is fabricated using established GaAs heterostructure MMIC technology to ensure good repeatability. In transistor mode, the three stage device behaved as a multi-gated pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistor with a drain-source saturation current of 32 mA and an off-state <b>drain-gate</b> breakdown <b>voltage</b> of 2. 8 V...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{breakdown}} {{behavior of the}} two-dimensional (2 -D) MESFET, which is a low-power heterodimensional transistor having dual side gates that contact {{the edge of the}} two-dimensional electron gas (2 -DEG) channel in a double-side planar-doped pseudomorphic Al 0 : 24 Ga 0 : 76 As/In 0 : 17 Ga 0 : 83 As material structure. Low output conductance (less than 6 mS/mm for VGS = 0 V) and low gate leakage current (less than 100 nA) are measured out to a drain-source bias of 20 V, indicating that the effects of impact ionization are reduced in the 2 -D MESFET. Excellent off-state drain-source and <b>drain-gate</b> breakdown <b>voltages</b> are experimentally measured to be 20 and 21 V, respectively. We attribute these high breakdown values to the electric and geometric properties of the heterodimensional Schottky metal/ 2 -DEG junction...|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} {{results of}} hydrogen degradation experiments performed on Al/Ti-gate AlGaAs/GaAs power HFETs. Upon storage at 180 °C for times up {{to a hundred}} hours in either 5 % or 15 % H 2 /N 2 mixtures, the HFETs undergo significant changes of the electrical characteristics, due to mechanisms located either under the gate (bulk effects) or on the surface access regions on the gate sides (surface effects). The former lead to a threshold voltage reduction and thus to and increase of the drain current, attributed {{to the formation of}} TiH in the gate and the attendant piezoelectric charge in the underlying semiconductor; a degradation of the peak transconductance is also observed. As for the surface effects, we measure an increase of source-gate and <b>drain-gate</b> breakdown <b>voltages,</b> due to surface-state creation on the gate sides and to electron capture therein...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} phenomena {{underlying the}} drain-gate breakdown of heterostructure FETs for microwave power applications {{are still not}} completely understood. On the other hand, power FETs with large <b>drain-gate</b> breakdown <b>voltage</b> are pivotal components for the booming market of wireless and personal communications, since they are required in handset and portable units {{as well as in}} base station amplifier circuits. A detailed study of their breakdown behavior is thus extremely urgent and important for the industrial development and exploitation of these devices. In this framework, we give in this abstract an analysis of the gate reverse current under off-state breakdown conditions, which are likely the most critical for the reliability of GaAs-based FETs operated in class AB or B for high-efficiency power amplification. A study of the temperature dependence of the gate reverse current allows us to identify the physical phenomena taking place in the drain-gate region at different values of the reverse bias and to pinpoint the mechanism giving rise to off-state breakdown...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we compare}} {{degradation}} modes and failure mechanisms of different AlGaN/GaN HEMT technologies. We present data concerning reverse-bias degradation of GaN-based HEMTs, {{which results in}} a dramatic increase of gate leakage current, and present a time-dependent model for gate degradation. Some of the tested technologies demonstrated to be immune from this failure mechanism up to <b>drain-gate</b> <b>voltages</b> in excess of 100 V. When this was case, the main failure mode consisted of drain current degradation during on-state tests, resulting from charge trapping in the gate-drain access region attributed to hot-electron effects. Finally, the use of diagnostic techniques such as electroluminescence microscopy and Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy for the identification of failure modes and mechanisms of GaN-based HEMTs is reviewed. Concerning reverse-bias degradation of GaN-based HEMTs, we demonstrate that, (i) when submitted to reverse-gate stress, HEMTs can show both recoverable and permanent degradation. (ii) recoverable degradation consists in the decrease in gate current and threshold voltage, which are ascribed to the simultaneous trapping of negative charge in the AlGaN layer, and of positive charge close to the AlGaN/GaN interface. (iii) permanent degradation consists in the generation of parasitic leakage paths. Time-dependent analysis suggests that permanent degradation can be ascribed to a defect generation and percolation process. Results supports {{the existence of a}} time to breakdown for HEMT degradation, which significantly depends on the stress voltage level. On the contrary, AlGaN/GaN technologies which were found to be resistant to gate degradation (off-state critical voltage larger than 100 V for a 0. 25 um gate device) were submitted to on-state tests at different gate and drain voltage levels. All tests showed a non-recoverable degradation of electrical parameters (drain saturation current, threshold voltage and on-state resistance) and electroluminescence signal EL, with a strong dependence on the EL value of the bias point, and a negligible dependence of temperature. Once verified that EL intensity represents a reliable estimate of channel hot electron effects, we attributed the degradation to hot electron trapping in the gate-drain access region. Using EL intensity as a measure of the stress acceleration factor, we derived an acceleration law for GaN HEMT hot electron degradation similar to the one already demonstrated for GaA...|$|R
