30|$|The {{flexible}} <b>graphite</b> <b>paper</b> used as conductive substrate was {{the same}} as our previous research [25]. In order to increase the functionalized sites for Cu 2 S adhesion on the surface of graphite, the substrate was annealed under 450 °C for 30 min in the air before use. Solvent thermal method was employed to deposit Cu 2 S nanoparticles. The procedures were described as follows [29]: 20 mM Cu(CH 3 COO) 2 and 10 mM thiourea were dissolved in diethylene glycol (DEG) sequentially and transferred to Teflon autoclave. Then, the annealed <b>graphite</b> <b>paper</b> was immersed and the autoclave was sealed and maintained at 180 °C for 2 – 12 h. After the reaction, the treated graphite was washed with deionized water three times and dried at 60 °C under vacuum overnight to get rid of water and residual DEG. This kind of CE was referred as nano-Cu 2 S/C in the following. For comparison, the annealed <b>graphite</b> <b>paper,</b> the thermally decomposed Pt electrodes on F-doped SnO 2 conducting glass (FTO, 15 Ω/□) and annealed <b>graphite</b> <b>paper,</b> carbon counter electrodes on these two substrates [16] as well as Au electrode on FTO glass by evaporative deposition were also used as CEs for QDSCs.|$|E

Scanning electron microscopy and linear sweep voltammetry were used to characterize the deposited films and investigate their electrochemical activity. Furthermore, the effects of electrophoretic deposition conditions on deposit morphology and subsequently the effects of deposit morphology on electrochemical activity in 2 M ammonium sulfite were studied to better understand how to improve electrocatalysts.

40|$|Porous tin {{films as}} anode for {{lithium-ion}} batteries are electrodeposited on <b>graphite</b> <b>paper.</b> Homogeneous tin films with significant void space accommodate the volume change during tin lithiation/delithiation. Through adjusting the electrodeposition currents and time, the morphologies and void space of tin films on <b>graphite</b> <b>paper</b> are controllable. At fixed electrodeposition current densities, the prolonged electrodeposition time {{plays the role}} in growing big tin particles and resulting the disappearance of void space among tin particles. The increased electrodeposition current plays the role to increase the quantity of tin seeds in thickness of tin film, and the void space among tin particles remains but the thick film limits its electrochemical performance. The tin films electrodeposited at an optimized current densities and for an optimized electrodeposition time, present the best electrochemical performance, because the tin nanoparticles are well dispersed on graphite substrate including void space. The tin film electrodeposited at 0. 2 A cm- 2 for 2 min shows the capacity of 1. 0 mAh cm- 2 after 50 charge/discharge cycles.

Ammonia borane (AB) synthesized according to Ramachandran [31] {{was used as a}} starting material, and ferrocene was used as a catalyst. In a typical procedure, AB powder (4.0 g) and ferrocene (1.5 g) were mixed and charged into an graphite crucible of about 2 l capacity using a piece of <b>graphite</b> <b>paper</b> as inner lining, then the crucible was loaded into the furnace chamber. The chamber was sealed and pumped down to a base pressure of 0.1 Pa. Subsequently, 0.8 MPa high pure nitrogen was pressed into the furnace chamber.

30|$|AgNW/TRG/PVDF hybrid {{composites}} {{were prepared}} using solution mixing followed by coagulation and thermal hot pressing. Electrical measurements {{showed that the}} bulk conductivity of hybrids was higher than a combined total conductivity of both TRG/PVDF and AgNW/PVDF composites at the same filler loading. This {{was due to the}} AgNWs bridged TRG sheets effectively in forming a conductive network in the PVDF matrix, producing a synergistic effect in conductivity. Consequently, electrical conductivity of 2  vol % AgNW/ 0.08  vol % TRG/PVDF composite was comparable to measured conductivity of <b>graphite</b> <b>paper.</b> Finally, the resistivity of hybrid composites increased with increasing temperature, particularly at the melting temperature of PVDF, generating a pronounced PTC effect. This effect was caused by the volume expansion of PVDF matrix with increasing temperature, which disrupted the synergistic effect and reduced electrical contacts among the conductive fillers.|$|E
