This study proposes an improved method with two novel contributions to former frequency based method. One is a novel preprocessing step consisting of <b>Hann</b> <b>windowing</b> and histogram equalization. <b>Hann</b> <b>windowing</b> is used to remove the boundary artifacts in the log spectrum while histogram equalization is used to enhance the contrast of the log spectrum. The other is an improved Hough transform based method to estimate the blur direction with cepstrum which eliminates the effect of noise. The method incorporates a least squares line fitting into the traditional Hough transform, and thus accurately estimates the direction.

30|$|The speech codebooks {{used in the}} {{experiments}} were trained using the Linde-Buzo-Gray (LBG) algorithm [39]. First, the clean speech training utterances, resampled at 8 kHz, were segmented into 50 % overlapped <b>Hann</b> <b>windowed</b> frames of size 256 samples each, corresponding to a duration of 32 ms wherein the speech signal can be assumed stationary. Then, LP coefficient vectors of dimension 10, extracted using these frames, were clustered using the LBG algorithm to generate speech codebooks of size 256 each using the Itakura-Saito (IS) distortion [40] as the error criterion.|$|R

40|$|The {{sinusoidal}} {{model has}} been a fundamentally important signal representation for coding and analysis of audio. We present an enhancement to sinusoidal modeling {{in the form of}} a linear frequency chirp parameter estimator applicable to Hann-windowed quasi-sinusoidal signals. The estimator relies on models of the phase curvature and peak width of a given chirp signal's FFT magnitude domain peak. We show that different models are applicable for smaller and larger values of the chirp parameter, derived respectively from Taylor series and Fresnel integral analysis of the signal. We construct an estimator for the transition region between the two models via a neural net. Results indicate that the estimator is robust to noise and outperforms any known chirp parameter estimators for <b>Hann</b> <b>windowed</b> signals...|$|R
30|$|For each audio file, sampled at 16 kHz, spectrograms {{were created}} by sox [42], using the fast Fourier {{transform}} (FFT) from time windows of 25 ms as <b>Hann</b> <b>windows</b> with a stride of 10 ms. This means that each window originally consisted of 400 samples (25 ms × 16 kHz). The images were then resized to 5 × 128 pixel images resulting in a DFT size of 254. As explained earlier, this was done {{in order to reduce}} the number of features extracted to a manageable dimensionality while prioritizing the frequency domain (which is simply reduced in the number of pixels equally over the entire image) and not the time domain since the time domain is handled by the HMM labeler. When a sentence ended in a number of milliseconds which is not divisible by 25, the last frame was squeezed into the penultimate frame (in all cases, this was silence). This process yielded 1, 447, 869 images for training and 482, 623 for testing.|$|R

In order to understand the statistical implication of this approach, it has been necessary to compute detection statistics for overlapped Hann spectra. Tables of signal detection statistics are given for false alarm rates from 10 (exp - 14) to 10 (exp - 1) and signal detection probabilities from 0. 50 to 0. 99; the number of computed spectra ranges from 4 to 2000...|$|R

This kernel-type was previously shown to be particularly suitable for newborn EEG signals[19, 34]. In this study, we tested three separable kernel TFDs to select the best one for representing the newborn EEG. The discrete-time versions of these kernels in the Doppler-Lag domain are given in in Table 2, where g(n) is the discrete Fourier transform of g(t) and h(m) is the discrete-time version of h(τ).

40|$|The {{choice of}} the window {{function}} and window length in short time analysis-synthesis (AS) systems based on the dis-crete Fourier transform (DFT) has to balance conflicting requirements: Long windows provide high spectral resolu-tion while short windows allow for high temporal resolution. Furthermore, for many applications a low algorithmic de-lay is desirable. Therefore, long standard windows such as the <b>Hann</b> or Hamming <b>windows</b> cannot be used. In this con-tribution we propose a novel AS system which achieves per-fect reconstruction (PR) and a low delay by using a variable length analysis window and a relatively short synthesis win-dow. The variable length analysis windows allow a spectral analysis that is adapted to the signals span of stationarity. The AS windows are designed such {{that they can be}} switched at any time instant without violating PR. We show that the spectral representation of typical speech data is improved as compared to AS systems with standard windows. 1...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / November 04 - 07, 1991 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaThere is a {{requirement}} to digitize certain wide-band analog signals in telemetry applications. Typically, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with eight or more bits of resolution is used. The resulting signal requires a much larger transmission bandwidth than the original analog signal. The frequency domain information is of primary interest for many applications. In these cases, there are several methods for minimizing the transmitted bandwidth. One method is to perform fast fourier transforms (FFTs) on the signals and only transmit information about the largest signals. The disadvantages of this approach include: relatively long time delay before transmission, resolution bandwidth fixed when FFT performed (unless phase information is also transmitted), and extra complexity in the telemeter. This paper will discuss some effects of minimizing the transmitted bandwidth by quantizing to {{a small number of}} bits. The performance will also be compared with analog frequency modulation (FM). Measured performance will be presented for four different input signals and one-, three-, and eight-bit quantization. These signals are amplitude modulation, angle modulation, sum of sine waves, and frequency sweep. The test setup is shown in figure 1. The analyses presented in this paper were performed using either fast fourier transforms (FFTs) or a Kay DSP Sonagraph. The FFT length was 1024 points and a <b>Hann</b> (cosine) <b>window</b> was used. The analysis hardware used for these tests has an analog input, therefore, all digitized signals were converted to analog signals before analysis. The signals were low pass filtered before analysis to minimize aliasing in the analysis and display process...|$|R

50|$|Figures 2 and 3 are {{plots of}} the {{magnitude}} of two different sized DFTs, as indicated in their labels. In both cases, the dominant component is at the signal frequency: f = 1/8 = 0.125. Also visible in Fig 2 is the spectral leakage pattern of the L = 64 rectangular window. The illusion in Fig 3 is a result of sampling the DTFT at just its zero-crossings. Rather than the DTFT of a finite-length sequence, it gives the impression of an infinitely long sinusoidal sequence. Contributing factors to the illusion are the use of a rectangular window, and the choice of a frequency (1/8 = 8/64) with exactly 8 (an integer) cycles per 64 samples. A <b>Hann</b> <b>window</b> would produce a similar result, except the peak would be widened to 3 samples (see DFT-even <b>Hann</b> <b>window).</b>|$|E
40|$|Comb {{filtering}} {{occurs when}} a signal is summed with a delayed version of itself. This can occur in live or studio sound production when multiple microphones reproduce a single source. The delay between microphone signals can be estimated using signal processing techniques and the signals aligned by applying a compensating delay. Accurate delay estimation is important for comb filter reduction as errors will lead to flanging effects on the input sources. This paper offers a novel analysis of {{the accuracy of the}} Generalized Cross Correlation with Phase Transform (GCC-PHAT) delay estimation technique when applied to arbitrary music signals whereas previous research is mostly concerned with speech signals. We show that the performance of GCC-PHAT is dependent on the choice of window used for the Discrete Fourier Transform calculation and, for poor choice of window, may also be highly dependent on the bandwidth of the incoming signal. This has not been explored previously in the literature. Analysis is provided that shows that the side lobe characteristics affect the accuracy of delay estimation, and windows that taper to 0 will provide the highest accuracy. The derived results are further confirmed through analysis and experimentation with simulated and real signals. In particular, the <b>Hann</b> or Blackman <b>windows</b> offer the highest performance for a variety of musical signals, with over 90 % accuracy for frame sizes over 256 samples, and are unaffected by input signal bandwidth. ...|$|R

To generate it with the formula in section <b>Hann</b> <b>window,</b> the window length (N) is 513, and the 513th coefficient of the generated sequence is discarded.
