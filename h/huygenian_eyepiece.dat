His aim was to understand telescopes. He began grinding his own lenses in 1655, collaborating with his brother Constantijn. [...] He designed in 1662 what is now called the <b>Huygenian</b> <b>eyepiece,</b> with two lenses, as a telescope ocular. Lenses were also a common interest through which Huygens could meet socially in the 1660s with Baruch Spinoza, who ground them professionally. They had rather different outlooks on science, Spinoza being the more committed Cartesian, and some of their discussion survives in correspondence. He encountered the work of Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, another lens grinder, in the field of microscopy which interested his father.|$|E
50|$|In some {{eyepiece}} types, such as Ramsden eyepieces (described in {{more detail}} below), the eyepiece behaves as a magnifier, and its focal plane is located outside of the eyepiece {{in front of the}} field lens. This plane is therefore accessible as a location for a graticule or micrometer crosswires. In the <b>Huygenian</b> <b>eyepiece,</b> the focal plane is located between the eye and field lenses, inside the eyepiece, and is hence not accessible.|$|E
