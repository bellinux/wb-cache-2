5|$|The First Crusade (1095–1099) was {{the first}} of a number of crusades that {{attempted}} to capture the <b>Holy</b> <b>Land,</b> called for by Pope Urban II at the Council of Clermont in 1095. It started as a widespread pilgrimage of western Christendom and ended as a military expedition by Roman Catholic Europe to regain the <b>Holy</b> <b>Land</b> taken in the Muslim conquests of the Levant (632–661), ultimately resulting in the capture of Jerusalem in 1099.|$|E
5|$|After the Franks {{were driven}} from the <b>Holy</b> <b>Land</b> in 1291, European {{familiarity}} with the castles of the Crusades declined. It {{was not until the}} 19thcentury that interest in these buildings was renewed, so there are no detailed plans from before 1837. Guillaume Rey was the first European researcher to scientifically study Crusader castles in the <b>Holy</b> <b>Land.</b> In 1871 he published the work Etudes sur les monuments de l'architecture militaire des Croisés en Syrie et dans l'ile de Chypre; it included plans and drawings of the major Crusader castles in Syria, including Krak des Chevaliers. In some instances his drawings were inaccurate, however for Krak des Chavaliers they record features which have since been lost.|$|E
5|$|Although about 300 French knights {{accompanied}} {{him to the}} <b>Holy</b> <b>Land,</b> no influential noblemen joined him; they preferred participating in the French Albigensian Crusade or did not see him as sufficiently eminent. John's cousin, Walter of Montbéliard, joined him only after he was expelled from Cyprus. Montbéliard led a naval expedition to Egypt to plunder the Nile Delta. After most of the French crusaders left the <b>Holy</b> <b>Land,</b> John forged a new truce with Al-Adil {{by the middle of}} 1211 and sent envoys to Pope Innocent urging him to preach a new crusade.|$|E

5|$|John did {{not return}} to the crusaders in Egypt for several months. According to a letter from the prelates in the <b>Holy</b> <b>Land</b> to Philip II of France, lack of funds kept John from leaving his kingdom. Since his nephew Walter IV was {{approaching}} the age of majority, John surrendered the County of Brienne in 1221. During John's absence from Egypt, Al-Kamil again offered to restore the <b>Holy</b> <b>Land</b> to the Kingdom of Jerusalem in June 1221; Pelagius refused him. John returned to Egypt and rejoined the crusade on 6 July 1221 at the command of Pope Honorius.|$|E
5|$|Maria died {{shortly after}} giving birth to their daughter, Isabella, in late 1212. Her death {{triggered}} a legal dispute, with John of Ibelin (who administered Jerusalem before John's coronation) questioning the widowed king's right to rule. The king sent Raoul of Merencourt, Bishop of Sidon, to Rome for assistance from the Holy See. Pope Innocent confirmed John as lawful ruler of the <b>Holy</b> <b>Land</b> in early 1213, urging the prelates to support him with ecclesiastical sanctions if needed. Most of the Jerusalemite lords remained loyal to the king, acknowledging his right to administer the kingdom {{on behalf of his}} infant daughter; John of Ibelin left the <b>Holy</b> <b>Land</b> and settled in Cyprus.|$|E
5|$|The Crusades in the <b>Holy</b> <b>Land</b> are {{traditionally}} counted as nine distinct campaigns, numbered from the First Crusade of 1095–99 to the Ninth Crusade of 1271–72. This convention {{is used by}} Charles Mills in his History of the Crusades for the Recovery and Possession of the <b>Holy</b> <b>Land</b> (1820), and is often retained for convenience {{even though it is}} somewhat arbitrary. The Fifth and Sixth Crusades led by FrederickII may be considered a single campaign, as can the Eighth Crusade and Ninth Crusade led by LouisIX.|$|E

5|$|Alice's second husband, Bohemond, {{was the son}} of Bohemond IV and {{his first}} wife, Plaisance Embriaco. He only succeeded his father in Antioch and Tripoli in 1233, after his {{marriage}} with Alice was annulled. Alice's young third husband, Ralph of Nesle, came to the <b>Holy</b> <b>Land</b> during the crusade of Theobald IV of Champagne in September 1239.|$|E
5|$|Andrew II betrothed Béla to {{an unnamed}} {{daughter}} of Tzar Boril of Bulgaria in 1213 or 1214, but their engagement was broken. In 1214, the King requested the Pope to excommunicate some unnamed lords who {{were planning to}} crown Béla king. Even so, the eight-year-old Béla was crowned in the same year, but his father did not grant him a province to rule. Furthermore, when leaving for a Crusade to the <b>Holy</b> <b>Land</b> in August 1217, King Andrew appointed John, Archbishop of Esztergom, to represent him during his absence. During this period, Béla stayed with his maternal uncle Berthold of Merania in Steyr in the Holy Roman Empire. Andrew II returned from the <b>Holy</b> <b>Land</b> in late 1218. He had arranged the engagement of Béla and Maria, a daughter of Theodore I Laskaris, Emperor of Nicaea. She accompanied King Andrew to Hungary and Béla married her in 1220.|$|E
5|$|As a bishop, Baldwin {{came to the}} {{attention}} of King Henry II of England, who was so impressed he insisted that Baldwin become archbishop. In that office, Baldwin quarrelled with his cathedral clergy over the founding of a church, which led to the imprisonment of the clergy in their cloister for more than a year. Baldwin spent some time in Wales with Gerald of Wales, preaching and raising money for the Third Crusade. After the coronation of King Richard I, the new king sent Baldwin ahead to the <b>Holy</b> <b>Land,</b> where he became embroiled in the politics of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Baldwin died in the <b>Holy</b> <b>Land</b> while participating in the crusade; his long-running dispute with his clergy led one chronicler to characterise Baldwin as more damaging to Christianity than Saladin.|$|E

5|$|Maulay {{had vowed}} {{to go on}} crusade in 1220, and in 1241 he finally {{set out for the}} <b>Holy</b> <b>Land,</b> along with Richard of Cornwall. Maulay died later in 1241, {{probably}} while still in the <b>Holy</b> <b>Land.</b> His wife died before him and his heir was his son Peter de Maulay. Besides his heir, Maulay had two other sons– Robert and Stephen, and a daughter, Hilary, who married Piers de Brus, son and heir of Piers de Brus, the Lord of Skelton. Maulay had endowed a chantry at Meaux Abbey in Yorkshire in memory of his wife. He also confirmed grants of lands to Eskdale Priory, a Grandmontine house founded by Isabella's father, and to Nostell Priory. Maulay was also a benefactor of the Knights of Saint Thomas, a military religious order for Englishmen.|$|E

5|$|The only {{significant}} Christian {{success of the}} Second Crusade came to a combined force of 13,000 Flemish, Frisian, Norman, English, Scottish, and German crusaders in 1147. Travelling from England, by ship, to the <b>Holy</b> <b>Land,</b> the army stopped and helped the smaller (7,000) Portuguese army in the capture of Lisbon, expelling its Moorish occupants.|$|E

50|$|In Cyprus {{the title}} became so {{prevalent}} {{as to be}} permanently integrated into some Greek Christian family names, such as Hajiioannou.

John sent letters to European monarchs and the pope, pleading for assistance. Since {{the survival of the}} Latin Empire was in jeopardy, Pope Gregory urged the crusaders to defend Constantinople instead of the <b>Holy</b> <b>Land.</b> A combined naval force from Venice, Genoa, Pisa and Geoffrey II of Achaea broke through the blockade. Asen soon abandoned his alliance with Vatatzes, who was forced to lift the siege in 1236.|$|E
