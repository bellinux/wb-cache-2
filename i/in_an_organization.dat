Each of Weber's principles can degenerateand more so, when {{they are used to}} analyze the individual level <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>organization.</b> But, when implemented in a group setting <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>organization,</b> some form of efficiency and effectiveness can be achieved, especially with regard to better output. This is especially true when the Bureaucratic model emphasizes qualification (merits), specialization of job-scope (labour), hierarchy of power, rules and discipline.|$|E

A qualitative research method, based on scientific analysis allowed to reveal what features of a culture influence creativity <b>in</b> <b>a</b> creative <b>organization.</b> Thus the research results show that different features of culture, influencing creativity, are identified in different levels of <b>a</b> culture <b>in</b> <b>a</b> creative <b>organization...</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1950 Hicks {{and other}} women based on the East coast of the United States began meeting <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>organization,</b> the goal of which was to advance female {{engineers}} and increase female participation in engineering. The organization was incorporated as the Society of Women Engineers two years later. Hicks served {{as the president of}} the organization for two consecutive terms, from 1950 to 1952. In 1963 the Society of Women Engineers presented their highest honor, the Society of Women Engineers Achievement Award, to Hicks. Hicks toured the United States, championing the cause of female engineers through outreach and speaking engagements. She believed that while female engineers would initially be closely watched, they would also be quickly accepted.|$|E

Crimean social democrats {{sent him to the}} capital, Petrograd, to represent them, but he soon moved to an internationalist revolutionary position, which made it impossible for him to remain <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>organization</b> dominated by less radical Mensheviks. Instead, he joined forces with Trotsky, who had just returned from abroad.|$|E
25|$|A {{functional}} {{organizational structure}} is {{a structure that}} consists of activities such as coordination, supervision and task allocation. The organizational structure determines how the organization performs or operates. The term organizational structure refers to how the people <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>organization</b> are grouped and to whom they report. One traditional way of organizing people is by function. Some common functions within an organization include production, marketing, human resources, and accounting.|$|E
5000|$|In flat organizations, {{the number}} of people {{directly}} supervised by each manager is large, and {{the number of}} people in the chain of command above one is small. [...] <b>A</b> manager <b>in</b> <b>a</b> flat <b>organization</b> possesses more responsibility than <b>a</b> manager <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tall <b>organization</b> because there is a greater number of individuals immediately below who are dependent on direction, help, and support. Moreover, managers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> flat <b>organization</b> rely less on guidance from superiors because the number of superiors above the manager is limited.|$|R

25|$|Others {{have claimed}} that {{reengineering}} was a recycled buzzword for commonly-held ideas. Abrahamson (1996) argued that fashionable management terms tend to follow a lifecycle, which for Reengineering peaked between 1993 and 1996 (Ponzi and Koenig 2002). They argue that Reengineering was in fact nothing new (as e.g. when Henry Ford implemented the assembly line in 1908, he was in fact reengineering, radically changing the way of thinking <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>organization).</b>|$|E
25|$|The job-based {{theories}} {{hold that}} the key to motivation is within an employee's job itself. Generally, these theories say that jobs can be motivating by their very design. This is a particularly useful view for organizations, because the practices set out in the theories can be implemented more practically <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>organization.</b> Ultimately, according to the job-based theories, the key to finding motivation through one's job is being able to derive satisfaction from the job content.|$|E
25|$|The {{goal is to}} {{increase}} the flow of projects <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>organization</b> (throughput). Applying the first three of the five focusing steps of TOC, the system constraint for all projects, as well as the resources, are identified. To exploit the constraint, tasks on the critical chain are given priority over all other activities. Finally, projects are planned and managed to ensure that the resources are ready when the critical chain tasks must start, subordinating all other resources to the critical chain.|$|E

25|$|The {{structure}} {{and size of}} a company must be distinguished.

25|$|The {{glass ceiling}} is one {{prevalent}} {{concern about the}} quality of economic opportunity available to women involved in the formal labor market. This phenomenon is the de facto limitation of females' ability to achieve the top levels of leadership <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>organization.</b> While the concept is not restricted to the market, it is prevalent in profit-based institutions. With respect to female workers in majority Muslim countries, women are not evenly represented {{on the board of directors}} or among the senior management positions of most of the 100 most lucrative companies in the Arab World.|$|E

She and her co-workers developed a detailed plan to unite the various suffrage associations in New York City (and later in the entire state) <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>organization</b> modeled on political machines like Tammany Hall. In 1909, they founded the Woman Suffrage Party (WSP) at a convention attended by over a thousand delegates and alternates. By 1910, the WSP had 20,000 members and a four-room headquarters. Shaw was not entirely comfortable with the independent initiatives of the WSP, but Catt and other of its leaders remained loyal to the NAWSA, its parent organization.|$|E
25|$|Trying to {{maintain}} control and civil order (a Mandate requirement if nothing else), the British enacted the Defence Emergency Regulations in September 1945. These regulations suspended Habeas Corpus and established military courts. They prescribed {{the death penalty for}} various offences, including carrying weapons or ammunition illegally and membership <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>organization</b> whose members commit these offenses. As World War II ended, a Jewish insurgency began, with the Zionist groups Irgun and Lehi attacking British targets in order to compel the British to leave Palestine. The insurgency was a response to Britain's implementation of the White Paper of 1939, which greatly restricted Jewish immigration and land purchases.|$|E

Olmsted's election to MOLLUS is significant in {{that he was one}} of the few civilians elected to membership <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>organization</b> composed almost exclusively of military officers and their descendants.

The Urban Affairs Committee guided the Chamber’s urban program which set about trying to address problems identified by the Dirty Dozen. Lowe was a member of this committee. It became clear to the committee that solving social problems would require involvement from more people and a more representative group of people, but they knew minorities would never participate <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>organization</b> controlled by the Chamber of Commerce.|$|E

The sentences for other members varied, ranging from 2 to 10 years. The group's members were located at Gasr prison until spring of 1969, when Saeed Kalantari Nazari, Sourky, Sarmady, and Choopan Zadeh attempted to escape from prison. This led to the relocation {{of the majority of}} the group members to rural areas. Jazani was sent to Qom with ordinary prisoners. Because of the respect of the prison guards towards Jazani, he was allowed to spend most of his time in the prison library studying and painting.|$|E
25|$|Operations {{management}} {{is an area}} of management concerned with designing and controlling the process of production and redesigning business operations in the production of goods or services. It involves the responsibility of ensuring that business operations are efficient in terms of using as few resources as needed and effective in terms of meeting customer requirements. It is concerned with managing an entire production system which is the process that converts inputs (in the forms of raw materials, labor, and energy) into outputs (in the form of goods and/or services), as an asset or delivers a product or services. Operations produce products, manage quality and creates service. Operation management covers sectors like banking systems, hospitals, companies, working with suppliers, customers, and using technology.
