5|$|Dougie steals the deputy's {{wedding ring}} and knocks over a {{container}} of Epsom salts into the tub where the unconscious Greer is soaking after Scully removed several specimens from his neck wounds. While Angela Villareal relieves herself, she spots the creature <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> with the deputy. Mulder and Scully enter the bathroom and find the clothes of the deputy but the man gone. Mulder theorizes that the entity does not just live in water but is a living form of water, becoming visible only when it attacks. He believes that the creature uses people as hosts to reproduce, with the body's water content being used to feed the growth of new creatures. Mulder realizes that everyone needs to evacuate.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{discovering}} her pregnancy, Quinn convinces Finn {{that he is}} the father, {{despite the}} fact that they never actually had a sexual encounter. Quinn claims that due to his premature ejaculation problem, and during their time in a hot-tub, Finn had ejaculated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> and Quinn had received the sperm. The real father is Finn's best friend Puck (Mark Salling), who offers to support Quinn and the baby, but is rejected for his irresponsibility. Quinn decides to have the baby adopted, and agrees to give it to Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig), the wife of glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), who is faking a pregnancy. When news of her pregnancy is revealed to the school, Quinn is cut from the cheerleading squad and her popularity declines. Her parents evict her, and Quinn moves in with Finn and his mother. She begins to reconsider having the baby adopted, and gives Puck a chance to prove himself, but he is not reliable so she returns to her plan of giving the baby to Terri. Quinn blackmails Sue into letting her rejoin the Cheerios, but ultimately decides against it, preferring to remain with the glee club, where she feels accepted. Finn learns the truth about the baby's paternity from Rachel, and breaks up with Quinn. Puck again offers to support her, but she turns him down and tells him that she wants to handle the pregnancy by herself. She moves in with Puck's family, but after forming a friendship with fellow New Directions member Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), Quinn lives with her family instead. She gives birth to a daughter, named Beth by Puck, who is adopted by Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel), coach of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline and Rachel's biological mother.|$|E

25|$|The {{reason for}} this is that human {{activities}} are adding CO2 to the atmosphere faster than natural processes can remove it (see carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere for a complete explanation). This is analogous to a flow of water into a bathtub. So long as the tap runs water (analogous to the emission of carbon dioxide) into the tub faster than water escapes through the plughole (the natural removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere), then the level of water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> (analogous to the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere) will continue to rise.|$|E
25|$|The video {{opens with}} a shot of running water. Rihanna is then {{presented}} undressing and climbing into a bathtub. Throughout {{the rest of the}} video, the singer is presented nude <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> full of cloudy green water; subtle camera angles protect her modesty. Rihanna is shown wearing little make-up and with long hair tangled and wet over one side of her face. The singer seems morose and sad as she occasionally flickers her eyes to the ceiling and puts her head in her hands, showing off long manicured nails and a diamond stud earring. The low-key video also features Mikky Ekko, who performs his parts of the song separately including scenes of him {{perched on the edge of}} a different bathtub, gazing into a mirror, in front of an unlit fireplace, and sitting on a grand chair. The video switches between the pair throughout the course of the video until it concludes with a single tear falling from Rihanna's eye as she sinks lower into the bathtub.|$|E
500|$|While {{taking a}} bath, {{he noticed that}} the level of the water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> rose as he got in, and {{realized}} that this effect could be used to determine the volume of the crown. For practical purposes water is incompressible, so the submerged crown would displace an amount of water equal to its own volume. By dividing the mass of the crown by the volume of water displaced, the density of the crown could be obtained. This density would be lower than that of gold if cheaper and less dense metals had been added. Archimedes then took to the streets naked, so excited by his discovery that he had forgotten to dress, crying [...] "Eureka!" [...] ( [...] , heúrēka!", meaning [...] "I have found !"). The test was conducted successfully, proving that silver had indeed been mixed in.|$|E

500|$|After being {{threatened}} {{to be killed}} by her, Toto calls the Munchkins, who set Dorothy free and hold up the witch. During the final battle, it cuts away to a scene where Quentin Tarantino is having a meeting with Kermit, discussing ideas for how Dorothy can defeat the Wicked Witch of the West. Tarantino's ideas are deemed too expensive and too violent for a Muppet movie, so they agree for Dorothy to do a powerful kick on the witch. Cutting back to the action, Dorothy kicks the witch into her own [...] "bottled water bath" [...] which contains tap water (to which she is severely allergic). Angel Marie admitted that he filled the water bottles with tap water to restock them. This action causes the Wicked Witch of the West to melt as Johnny averts Foo-Foo's eyes. With the Wicked Witch of the West dead, Dorothy finds the magic eye floating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> unharmed and grabs it.|$|E

Grampa reminisces about a pub in Dunkilderry, Ireland called O'Flanagan's, where he claims to have had the best night of his life many years ago. Homer decides to take Grampa there for one last drink. When the family arrives they realize Ireland has become a commercialized, hi-tech country of consumers and workaholics. The pub itself has run out of business as many of the patrons are now yuppies who have no interest in drinking. The pub owner Tom O'Flanagan is happy to have customers again. Homer and Grampa sit down at the pub and start drinking while Marge, Bart and Lisa visit various Irish landmarks. They visit the Giant's Causeway, Blarney Castle, the Guinness brewery and Dublin.|$|E

2500|$|Mr. Burns is {{physically}} weak, and often {{shown to have}} little more strength than an infant. In the intro of [...] "The Simpsons Movie", Mr. Burns is seen in his bathroom trying to brush his teeth. After Smithers applies the toothpaste onto his brush, he falls over. In [...] "Rosebud" [...] and [...] "Who Shot Mr. Burns?", he needed {{a great deal of}} effort to wrench items from Maggie. He has difficulty performing such simple actions as giving a thumbs-up, and crushing an insect by stepping on it, or using a door-knocker. [...] In one instance, when he is told to jump out of his burning mansion onto a life net, he drops at the speed of a feather and floats onto some power lines and is electrified. He pitched the opening baseball at a game in [...] "Dancin' Homer", but was only able to throw it a small distance, which drew mocking laughter from the crowd. When Mr. Burns joined Homer's bowling team in [...] "Team Homer", he was barely able to roll the ball down the lane. In season five's [...] "Burns' Heir", Smithers puts a sponge on Mr. Burns' head before leaving the bathroom, causing him to nearly drown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> from its weight.

2500|$|The {{music video}} to [...] "Better on the Other Side" [...] was {{released}} on June 30, 2009. The video was recorded and released within ten hours. The music video begins with clips of fans' tribute to Jackson outside the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where Jackson was pronounced dead at. Shortly after Diddy's part of the song begins to play, the voice of Diddy, who isn't seen throughout the entire video, is heard. Clips shown in the being of the video show a young fan holding a poster that reads [...] "R.I.P. Michael Jackson". From there are seen more images of fans, some mourning Jackson, some celebrating him by doing Jackson's signature dances and dressing like him. The Game begins rapping while lying in a bathtub, fully clothed and drinking as the water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> runs. Brown is shown moments after that, bobbing {{his head to the}} music. The video then goes back and forth between recording sessions for the song and tributes from Jackson's fans. The Game is shown in the studio with Brown, then we see Boyz II Men's Wanya Morris recording and singing his part on the record. We then see Game writing his rhyme for the song and, later, getting a new tattoo on his right arm. As the video ends, The Game stands up in the bathtub, takes off his shirt and reveals his new Michael Jackson tattoo. It is a picture of Jackson wearing a fedora and a mask on his face.|$|E

40|$|Between 1982 and 1985, 83 {{patients}} with hypopharyngeal or extensive laryngeal cancers underwent pharyngoesophagectomy (48 patients), circumferential pharyngectomy (8 patients) and partial pharyngectomy (27 patients), {{depending on the}} site and extent of tumor involvement. The resultant hypopharyngeal defects were reconstructed with gastric transposition, a tubed pectoralis major myocutaneous flap, and a pectoralis major flap patch, respectively. There were three hospital deaths <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gastric transposition group (6 percent) and none in both pectoralis major flap groups. The leakage rate was 8. 3 percent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gastric transposition group, 25 percent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tubed</b> pectoralis major flap group, and 3. 7 percent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pectoralis major flap patch group. Stricture was avoided with the interdigitation technique used at the tubed-flap-to-esophagus anastomosis, although the fistula rate was high. The overall complication rate was higher with gastric transposition. Although swallowing was satisfactory in all three groups, 42 percent of the {{patients with}} gastric transposition experienced regurgitation. Over a follow-up period of 16 to 50 months the local recurrence rate was 5 percent, and the actuarial survival rate was 55 percent at 24 months. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|In chemistry, thermodynamics, {{and other}} {{chemical}} engineering, a steady {{state is a}} situation in which all state variables are constant in spite of ongoing processes that strive to change them. For an entire system to be at steady state, i.e. for all state variables of a system to be constant, there must be a flow through the system (compare mass balance). One of the simplest examples of such a system is the case of a bathtub with the tap open but without the bottom plug: after a certain time <b>the</b> water flows <b>in</b> and out at the same rate, so the water level (the state variable being Volume) stabilizes and the system is at steady state. Of course the Volume stabilizing inside <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> depends on <b>the</b> size of <b>the</b> <b>tub,</b> <b>the</b> diameter of the exit hole and the flowrate of water <b>in.</b> Since <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> can overflow, eventually a steady state can be reached where <b>the</b> water flowing <b>in</b> equals <b>the</b> overflow plus the water out through the drain.|$|R
