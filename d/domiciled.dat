As Prince of Wales the centre label lost its anchor. As King, he bore the royal arms. In 1917, he removed, by warrant, the Saxony inescutcheon from the arms of all male-line {{descendants}} of the Prince Consort <b>domiciled</b> in the United Kingdom (although the royal arms themselves had never borne the shield).|$|E
5|$|As a United States {{district}} court, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri conducts civil {{trials and}} issues orders. The cases it hears concern either federal question jurisdiction, where {{a federal law}} or treaty is applicable, or diversity jurisdiction, where parties are <b>domiciled</b> in different states. The court also holds criminal trials of persons charged with violations of federal law. Appeals from cases brought in the Eastern District of Missouri are heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit). These cases can then be appealed to the United States Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia {{defines a}} Malay as a Malaysian citizen {{born to a}} Malaysian citizen who professes to be a Muslim, habitually speaks the Malay language, adheres to Malay customs, and is <b>domiciled</b> in Malaysia or Singapore. Though this {{definition}} is not according to ancestry lineage, it is however correct {{in the sense of}} social behaviours. Culture, which controls a great proportion of general mentality and social behaviour, is succeeded through the mother tongue and religion. Article 160 unites Malays from different ethnic groups as the prevailing race and thus embraces them with the political prowess to dominate and rule over other races: Chinese, Indians, Kadazan, Iban, Orang Asli etc. This is also apparent from the name of UMNO (United Malays National Organisation), who are a staunch political proponent of this role.|$|E
5|$|Equality {{in matters}} of public employment: Article 16 of the {{constitution}} lays down that the State cannot discriminate against anyone in the matters of employment. All citizens can apply for government jobs. There are some exceptions. The Parliament may enact a law stating that certain jobs can be filled only by applicants who are <b>domiciled</b> in the area. This may be meant for posts that require knowledge of the locality and language of the area. The State may also reserve posts for members of backward classes, scheduled castes or scheduled tribes which are not adequately represented in the services under the State {{to bring up the}} weaker sections of the society. Also, there a law may be passed that requires that the holder of an office of any religious institution shall also be a person professing that particular religion. According to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2003, this right shall not be conferred to Overseas citizens of India.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{awarding}} the Victoria Cross may {{take place in}} two ways: One is through a recommendation by the Decorations and Commendations Advisory Committee, which {{is a part of}} the Department of National Defence and has six members, one appointed by the governor general and the rest by the chief of the Defence Staff. Alternatively, a field commander can submit a name for consideration, though permission must be obtained from the governor general before the award can be presented. Recipients are entitled to receive an annuity from the federal Canadian Crown; per the Canadian gallantry awards order issued in January 2005, members of the Canadian Forces or those who joined the British forces while <b>domiciled</b> in Canada or Newfoundland prior to 31 March 1949, after receiving the Victoria Cross, be granted C$3,000 each year.

25|$|Traces of {{dwellings}} {{dating from}} 200 BC were found, ancient Roman villae, {{as well as}} around the city. However, residents could have been be <b>domiciled</b> here well before.

The other surrounding plateaux also attest this presence with other dolmens (on the Causse de Changefege for example). These remains may date from the Chalcolithic period.|$|E

25|$|By contrast, {{offshore}} {{corporate funds}} are usually used for non-US investors, {{and when they}} are <b>domiciled</b> in an applicable offshore tax haven, no entity-level tax is imposed. Many managers of offshore funds permit the participation of tax-exempt US investors, such as pensions funds, institutional endowments and charitable trusts. As an alternative legal structure, offshore funds may be formed as an open-ended unit trust using an unincorporated mutual fund structure. Japanese investors prefer to invest in unit trusts, such as those available in the Cayman Islands.|$|E

25|$|The Malay Peninsula {{grew from}} port towns that thrived {{on the trade}} routes from China to India., and hosted the next groups of {{migrants}} as merchants became <b>domiciled</b> in the ports, some settling permanently and assimilating into the local communities.

At the periphery, control is less certain, borders may become permeable, control sometimes overlapped, where areas could be subject to several powers, or none.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{marriage}} {{which has}} an international recognised legal status, there are no international treaties on recognition of unmarried couple's legal status. If an unmarried couple change residence to different countries, then the local law on where the couple is last <b>domiciled</b> is applied to them. This covers legal status of the relationship, rights, obligations, and all worldwide movable and immovable property. To otherwise interpret the law would mean if the unmarried couple had assets in several different countries, they would then need separate legal cases in each country to resolve all their movable and immovable property.|$|E
25|$|Krishnamurti and Nitya {{were taken}} to England in April 1911. During this trip Krishnamurti gave his first public speech, {{to members of the}} OSE in London.

Between 1911 and the start of World War I in 1914, the brothers visited several other European countries, always accompanied by Theosophist chaperones. Meanwhile, Krishnamurti had for the first time acquired a measure of personal financial independence, thanks to a wealthy benefactress, American Mary Melissa Hoadley Dodge, who was <b>domiciled</b> in England.|$|E
25|$|Each of {{the three}} {{companies}} (and later five others that were given contracts in 1859) was joint stock company <b>domiciled</b> in England with its financial capital raised in pound sterling. Each company was guaranteed a 5 per cent return on its capital outlay and, in addition, a share of half the profits. Although the Government of India had no capital expenditure other than the provision of the underlying land free of charge, it had the onus of continuing to provide the 5 percent return {{in the event of}} net loss, and soon all anticipation of profits would fall by the wayside as the outlays would mount.|$|E

His wife brought considerable wealth into the marriage, enabling him to act with political independence and providing finances to establish his own newspapers. His wife (1860–1960) who survived him by over 30 years, gave him considerable moral and emotional support for his political pursuits. Their relationship added an abiding love for France and attachment to Europe to his life, where he often retired to recuperate.|$|E

In this context, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Brazil signed on 1 January 1994 in the city of Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay, the Colonia Protocol for the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Mercosur Investments (Colonia Protocol). It was established in this protocol that investments under Mercosur by investors resident or <b>domiciled</b> in the territory of any member state will be entitled to treatment no less favorable than that accorded by the other member state to national investors or nonmember states.|$|E
