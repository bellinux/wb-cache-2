5|$|The second round, Double <b>Jeopardy!,</b> {{features}} six new {{categories of}} clues. Clue values are doubled from the <b>Jeopardy!</b> round (except in Super <b>Jeopardy!,</b> where Double <b>Jeopardy!</b> values ranged from 500 to 2,500 points). The contestant {{with the least}} amount of money {{at the end of the}} <b>Jeopardy!</b> round makes the first selection in Double Jeopardy!; if there is a tie, the tied contestant standing at the leftmost lectern selects first.|$|E
5|$|Chu spent a {{great deal}} of time {{preparing}} in the month before his first appearance on <b>Jeopardy!</b> He studied tapes of former <b>Jeopardy!</b> contestants and created study guides based on the advice of Roger Craig. He also read about game theory and <b>Jeopardy!</b> strategy online. As a student at Swarthmore College, he also played quiz bowl, in which he has said he was an aggressive player despite having limited knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Contestants who finish Double <b>Jeopardy!</b> with $0 or a {{negative}} score are automatically {{eliminated from the}} game at that point and awarded the third place prize. On at least one episode hosted by Art Fleming, all three contestants finished Double <b>Jeopardy!</b> with $0 or less, and as a result, no Final <b>Jeopardy!</b> round was played. This rule is still in-place for the Trebek version, although staff has suggested {{that it is not}} set in stone and that executive producer Harry Friedman may decide to display the clue for home viewers' play if such a situation were ever to occur. During Celebrity <b>Jeopardy!</b> games, contestants with a $0 or negative score are given $1,000 for the Final <b>Jeopardy!</b> round.|$|E
5|$|In the finals, contestants who finish Double <b>Jeopardy!</b> with a $0 or {{negative}} score on either day do not play Final <b>Jeopardy!</b> that day; their score for that leg is recorded as $0.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} episode of <b>Jeopardy!</b> season 31, which aired on September 15, 2014, <b>Jeopardy!</b> {{champion}} Elizabeth Williams echoed Cliff Clavin's answer in her response to the Final <b>Jeopardy</b> clue. Williams's $600 wager combined with her opponents' incorrect responses allowed Williams to triumph that day, nonetheless.|$|E
5|$|The Clue Crew has {{traveled}} to 280 cities worldwide, spanning all 50 of the United States and 44 other countries. In addition to appearing in <b>Jeopardy!</b> clue videos, the team's members also {{travel to meet}} fans of the show and future contestants. Occasionally, they visit schools to showcase the educational game Classroom <b>Jeopardy!</b> Miyahara also serves as announcer for the Sports <b>Jeopardy!</b> spin-off series.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Jeopardy!</b> and Double <b>Jeopardy!</b> rounds each feature six categories, each {{of which}} {{contains}} five clues, which are ostensibly valued by difficulty. The dollar values of the clues increased over time. On the original <b>Jeopardy!</b> series, clue values {{in the first round}} ranged from $10 to $50. On The All-New <b>Jeopardy!,</b> they ranged from $25 to $125. The current series' first round originally ranged from $100 to $500, and were doubled to $200 to $1,000 on November 26, 2001. On the Super <b>Jeopardy!</b> specials, clues were valued in points rather than in dollars, and ranged in the first round from 200 to 1,000 points.|$|E
5|$|Three International Tournaments, held in 1996, 1997, and 2001, {{featured}} one-week competitions among champions {{from each}} of the international versions of <b>Jeopardy!.</b> Each of the countries that aired their own version of the show in those years could nominate a contestant. The format was identical to the semifinals and finals of other <b>Jeopardy!</b> tournaments. In 1996 and 1997, the winner received $25,000; in 2001, the top prize was doubled to $50,000. The 1997 tournament was recorded in Stockholm on the set of the Swedish version of <b>Jeopardy!,</b> and is significant for being the first week of <b>Jeopardy!</b> episodes to be taped in a foreign country.|$|E
5|$|Chu {{prepared}} extensively {{before his}} <b>Jeopardy!</b> appearance by reviewing tapes, study guides, game theory and <b>Jeopardy!</b> strategy. He made his debut on January 28, 2014, winning $37,000 {{in his first}} game. After winning 11 games, he lost his 12th game (which aired on March 12, 2014) to Diana Peloquin. Chu is the sixth highest-earning <b>Jeopardy!</b> champion in non-tournament gameplay, with {{a grand total of}} $298,200. Chu also won an additional $100,000 for taking second place in the 2014 Tournament of Champions.|$|E
5|$|Craig is {{the holder}} {{of the all-time}} record for single-day {{winnings}} on <b>Jeopardy!.</b> On the episode that aired September 14, 2010, he amassed a score of $47,000 after the game's first two rounds, then wagered and won an additional $30,000 in the Final <b>Jeopardy!</b> round, finishing with $77,000. The previous single-day record of $75,000 had been set by Jennings.|$|E
5|$|GSN, which, like <b>Jeopardy!,</b> is an {{affiliate}} of Sony Pictures Television, has rerun ten seasons since the channel's launch in 1994. Copies of 43 Trebek-hosted syndicated <b>Jeopardy!</b> episodes aired between 1989 and 2004 have been collected by the UCLA Archive, and the premiere and various other episodes {{are included in the}} Paley Center's collection.|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} a tie for the final wild card position, the non-winner that {{advances}} {{will be based on}} the same regulations as two contestants who tie for second; the tie-breaker is the contestant's score after the Double <b>Jeopardy!</b> round, and if further tied, the score after the <b>Jeopardy!</b> round determines the contestant who advances as the wild card.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, <b>Jeopardy!</b> updated its set once again. The new set debuted {{with special}} episodes taped at the 42nd annual International CES {{technology}} trade show, hosted at the Las Vegas Convention Center in Winchester (Las Vegas Valley), Nevada, {{and became the}} primary set for <b>Jeopardy!</b> when the show began taping its 26th season, which premiered on September 14, 2009. It was significantly remodeled when season 30 premiered in September 2013.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Jennings and Rutter {{were both}} invited {{to play in}} the <b>Jeopardy!</b> Battle of the Decades, a tournament {{conducted}} by the producers of <b>Jeopardy!</b> to celebrate its thirtieth season in syndication. Both men advanced to the two-day tournament final with Roger Craig filling the third position. Needing a win to reclaim his record, Rutter took the top prize in the tournament after Jennings, who needed to answer the second day's Final <b>Jeopardy</b> clue correctly to win (after making a sufficient wager), failed to do so. Rutter won the top prize of $1,000,000 while Jennings won the $100,000 second prize.|$|E
5|$|In initial tests run during 2006 by David Ferrucci, {{the senior}} manager of IBM's Semantic Analysis and Integration department, Watson was given 500 clues from past <b>Jeopardy!</b> programs. While the best real-life {{competitors}} buzzed {{in half the}} time and responded correctly {{to as many as}} 95% of clues, Watson's first pass could get only about 15% correct. During 2007, the IBM team was given three to five years and a staff of 15 people to solve the problems. By 2008, the developers had advanced Watson such that it could compete with <b>Jeopardy!</b> champions. By February 2010, Watson could beat human <b>Jeopardy!</b> contestants on a regular basis.|$|E
5|$|Its Linpack {{performance}} {{stands at}} 80 TeraFLOPs, {{which is about}} half {{as fast as the}} cut-off line for the Top 500 Supercomputers list. According to Rennie, all content was stored in Watson's RAM for the <b>Jeopardy</b> game because data stored on hard drives would be too slow to be competitive with human <b>Jeopardy</b> champions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Jeopardy!</b> {{has spawned}} {{versions}} in many foreign countries throughout the world, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Russia, Denmark, Israel, and Australia. The American syndicated version of <b>Jeopardy!</b> is also broadcast throughout the world, with international distribution rights handled by CBS Studios International.|$|E
5|$|The daily {{syndicated}} {{version of}} <b>Jeopardy!</b> {{is produced by}} Sony Pictures Television (previously known as Columbia TriStar Television, the successor company to original producer Merv Griffin Enterprises). The copyright holder is <b>Jeopardy</b> Productions, which, like SPT, operates as a subsidiary of Sony Pictures Entertainment. The rights to distribute the program worldwide are owned by CBS Television Distribution, which absorbed original distributor King World Productions in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} <b>Jeopardy!</b> {{series was}} directed at different times by Bob Hultgren, Eleanor Tarshis, and Jeff Goldstein. Dick Schneider, who directed episodes of The All-New <b>Jeopardy!,</b> returned as director for the Trebek version's first eight seasons. Since 1992, the show has been directed by Kevin McCarthy, who had previously served as associate director under Schneider.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} <b>Jeopardy!</b> {{series was}} taped in Studio 6A at NBC Studios at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, and The All-New <b>Jeopardy!</b> was taped in Studio 3 at NBC's Burbank Studios at 3000 West Alameda Avenue in Burbank, California. The Trebek version was initially taped at Metromedia Stage 7, KTTV, on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, but moved its production facilities to Hollywood Center Studios' Stage 9 in 1985. After the final shows of season 10 were recorded on February 15, 1994, the <b>Jeopardy!</b> production facilities {{were moved to}} Sony Pictures Studios' Stage 10 on Washington Boulevard in Culver City, California, where the show has been recorded ever since.|$|E
5|$|Three contestants each {{take their}} place behind a lectern, with the {{returning}} champion occupying the leftmost lectern (from the viewer's perspective). The contestants compete in a quiz game comprising three rounds: <b>Jeopardy!,</b> Double <b>Jeopardy!,</b> and Final <b>Jeopardy!.</b> The material for the clues covers {{a wide variety of}} topics, including history and current events, the sciences, the arts, popular culture, literature, and languages. Category titles often feature puns, wordplay, or shared themes, and the host will regularly remind contestants of topics or place emphasis on category themes {{before the start of the}} round.|$|E
5|$|Three {{spin-off}} {{versions of}} <b>Jeopardy!</b> have been created. Rock & Roll <b>Jeopardy!</b> debuted on VH1 in 1998 and ran until 2001; the show centered around post-1950s popular music trivia and was hosted by Jeff Probst. Jep!, which aired on GSN during the 1998–1999 season, {{was a special}} children's version hosted by Bob Bergen and featured various rule changes from the original version. Sports <b>Jeopardy!,</b> a sports-themed version hosted by Dan Patrick, premiered in 2014 on the Crackle digital service and eventually moved to the cable sports network NBCSN in 2016.|$|E
5|$|After his {{appearance}} on <b>Jeopardy!,</b> Chu contacted publicists and PR firms {{to ask for}} {{suggestions on how to}} monetize the recognition from his <b>Jeopardy!</b> run. However, he found the proposals unappealing, and did not follow suggestions that he use the 'successful game theorist' image. Instead, he started writing a column for The Daily Beast, and later for Salon. Chu has written on various aspects of nerd culture and on being Asian American. He is a vocal critic of racism and online bullying, and is known for his opposition to the Gamergate movement.|$|E
5|$|Chu {{made his}} debut as a {{contestant}} on the January 28, 2014, episode of <b>Jeopardy!,</b> winning $37,200 {{in his first}} game. On the January 29 episode, Chu made a Final <b>Jeopardy!</b> wager that caused him to tie fellow contestant Carolyn Collins. Chu claimed that he {{made the decision to}} wager for a tie not out of kindness but because of the advice of 2003 College champion Keith Williams, who claims that game theory favors wagering for a tie over the more common practice of wagering to win by a dollar. Chu defeated Collins on the January 30 episode.|$|E
5|$|Contestants' {{responses}} are revealed {{in order of}} their pre-Final <b>Jeopardy!</b> scores from lowest to highest. A correct response adds {{the amount of the}} contestant's wager to his/her score, while a miss, failure to respond, or failure to phrase the response as a question (even if correct) deducts it. The contestant with the highest score {{at the end of the}} round is that day's winner. If there is a tie for second place, consolation prizes are awarded based on the scores going into the Final <b>Jeopardy!</b> round. If all three contestants finish with $0, no one returns as champion for the next show, and based on scores going into the Final <b>Jeopardy!</b> round, the two contestants who were first and second will receive the second-place prize, and the contestant in third will receive the third-place prize.|$|E
5|$|Cordray has the {{distinction}} of being an undefeated five-time champion and Tournament of Champions semifinalist on <b>Jeopardy!</b> In 1987, he won $45,303 from the show, which he used to pay law school debt, to pay taxes and to buy a used car. The total winnings came from $40,303 in prize money during his five-contest streak and $5,000 for a first round win on the Tournament of Champions. His campaign for public office in 1990 precluded him from participating in the Super <b>Jeopardy!</b> elimination tournament of champions. ABC, the network that carried the tournament, had a policy against political contestants appearing on the show (excluding Celebrity <b>Jeopardy!).</b> He did, however, compete in the Battle of the Decades tournament, appearing in the show aired February 5, 2014, but finished second to aerospace consultant Tom Nosek. Because of his duties as a federal employee, however, he turned down the $5,000 consolation money he won in the match.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>Jeopardy!</b> round, {{except in}} {{response}} to the Daily Double clue, contestants are not penalized for forgetting to phrase their response {{in the form of a}} question, although the host will remind contestants to watch their phrasing in future responses. In the Double <b>Jeopardy!</b> round and in the Daily Double in the <b>Jeopardy!</b> round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not re-phrased before the host or judges make a ruling. If it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity. If, after a game is over, a ruling change is made that would have significantly altered the outcome of the game, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show.|$|E
5|$|Four contestants on the Trebek version {{have won}} a game with the lowest amount {{possible}} ($1). The first was U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Darryl Scott, on the episode that aired January 19, 1993; the second was Benjamin Salisbury, on a Celebrity <b>Jeopardy!</b> episode that aired April 30, 1997; the third was Brandi Chastain, on the Celebrity <b>Jeopardy!</b> episode that aired February 9, 2001; and the fourth was U.S. Navy Lieutenant Manny Abell, on the episode that aired October 17, 2017.|$|E
