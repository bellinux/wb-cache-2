Captain in 1889–1890, which post he filled with wonderful judgement." [...] At the end of the 1890 season he was presented with a handsome silver flask by members of Somerset County Cricket Club.|$|E

2500|$|For Rodriguez's and Carano's {{fight in}} the London Underground, {{producers}} refused to let the pair attempt a stunt where their characters battle over a stair rail and fall down a stairwell, fearing a serious injury would derail filming; stunt women performed the practical stunt. Morgan's scripted rendition of the fight {{was described as a}} catfight on steroids, but Rodriguez provided input to turn it into more of a street fight. Rodriguez said: [...] "Originally in the script, it was a lot more 'Terminator'-esque — too far-fetched to be believed... Things just happened so quick and then I'm on top? Justin and I had to bust our booties to get it more realistic. I was like, 'This [...] needs to kick my ass!'" [...] Rodriguez and Carano rehearsed their fight choreography over two months, with trained fighter Carano undergoing extra practice to ensure her strikes looked credible without <b>hitting</b> <b>hard</b> enough to harm Rodriguez. Under the direction of fight choreographer Olivier Schneider, the fight was designed to be brutal but realistic, representing Carano's [...] "cop with fight training" [...] and Rodriguez's street fighting.|$|E

6000|$|... "(Verona.) Comparing the arabesque and {{sculpture}} of the Duomo here with St. Mark's, {{the first thing}} that strikes one is the low relief, the second, the greater motion and spirit, with infinitely less grace and science. With the Byzantine, however rude the cutting, every line is lovely, and the animals or men are placed in any attitudes which secure ornamental effect, sometimes impossible ones, always severe, restrained, or languid. With the Romanesque workmen all the figures show the effort (often successful) to express energetic action; hunting chiefly, much fighting, and both spirited; some of the dogs running capitally, straining to it, and the knights <b>hitting</b> <b>hard,</b> while yet the faces and drawing are in the last degree barbarous. At Venice all is graceful, fixed, or languid; the eastern torpor is in every line,--the mark of a school formed on severe traditions, and keeping to them, and never likely or desirous to rise beyond them, but with an exquisite sense of beauty, and much solemn religious faith.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, you {{see that}} there is a very rough {{population}} in Alexandria--Greek, Maltese, and Italian, in fact the scum of the Mediterranean--and my father, who is a very sensible man, thought that the knowledge of how to use my fists well might be of much greater value to me than anything else I could learn in England, so he asked my uncle, with whom I lived when I was at school, to get me the best masters in boxing that he could find. I got to be very fond of it, and worked very hard. I had three lessons a week all the time I was at school, and the last year changed my master three times, and so got all their favourite hits. Of course I used to get knocked about, for some boxers can't help <b>hitting</b> <b>hard,</b> and to the end I used to get punished pretty heavily, because though I might hit them as often as they hit me, they were able to hit much harder than I was, but I fancy now that they would find it pretty hard work to knock me out of time. My father used to say that being really a good boxer kept a man or a boy out of trouble. A man who knows that he can fight well can afford to be good-tempered and put up with things that another man wouldn't, and if he is driven to use his fists gets off without being knocked about; and besides, as soon as it is known that he can fight, others don't care about quarrelling with him. I know that it was so with me. I had a fight or two at first, but I very quickly improved, and after that I never had a quarrel {{for the rest of the}} nearly three years I was at school." ...|$|E
