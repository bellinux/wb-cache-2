6000|$|Fifty hulls, at least, moulded on {{lines of}} beauty and speed--hulls of wood, of iron, expressing in their forms the highest {{achievement}} of modern ship-building--lay moored all in a row, stem to quay, as if assembled there for an exhibition, not of a great industry, but of a great art. Their colours were gray, black, dark green, with a narrow strip of yellow moulding defining their sheer, or with a row of painted ports decking in warlike decoration their robust flanks of cargo-carriers that would know no triumph but of speed in carrying a burden, no glory other than of a long service, no victory but that of an endless, obscure contest with the sea. The great empty hulls with swept holds, just out of dry-dock, with their paint glistening freshly, sat high-sided with ponderous dignity alongside the wooden jetties, looking more like unmovable buildings than things meant to go afloat; others, half loaded, far {{on the way to}} recover the true sea-physiognomy of a ship brought down to her load-line, looked more accessible. Their less steeply slanting gangways seemed to invite the strolling sailors in search of a berth to walk on board and try [...] "for a chance" [...] with the chief mate, the guardian of a ship's efficiency. As if anxious to remain unperceived amongst their overtopping sisters, two or three [...] "finished" [...] ships floated low, with an air of straining at the leash of their level headfasts, exposing to view their cleared decks and covered hatches, prepared to drop stern first out of the labouring ranks, displaying the true comeliness of form which only her proper sea-trim gives to a ship. And for a good quarter of a mile, from the dockyard gate to the farthest corner, where the old housed-in hulk, the President (<b>drill-ship,</b> then, of the Naval Reserve), used to lie with her frigate side rubbing against the stone of the quay, above all these hulls, ready and unready, a hundred and fifty lofty masts, more or less, held out the web of their rigging like an immense net, in whose close mesh, black against the sky, the heavy yards seemed to be entangled and suspended.|$|E

50|$|Contractors from Houston, Texas, were {{initially}} {{involved in the}} search, and their efforts were later augmented by the Toulon-based Institut Français de Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la Mer (IFREMER). In October 1994, a modified drilling ship (Drillship was the FlexLD, formerly Sedco 445 and later Peregrin VII and now Deepwater Navigator), carrying a 50-ton video-equipped grab designed by IFREMER, sailed {{to the location of}} the John Barry. By early November, much of the ship had been excavated, revealing vintage U.S. Army trucks, tanks, and military equipment. Soon after, the first sign of silver was seen (though initially the video feed was clouded by the ship's oil sticking to the camera lens). Over the next five days, the grab brought up 1.3 million Saudi riyals weighing 17 tons and showered them onto the <b>drill-ship's</b> deck. The purported Indian/Soviet silver was nowhere to be found, although the salvagers were unable to access all the locations they suspected the silver might rest. While some plans have surfaced to relaunch the recovery effort, none have come to fruition.|$|R

5000|$|Plans {{called for}} the [...] <b>drill-ship</b> JOIDES Resolution to sail from Colombo in Sri Lanka in late 2015 and {{to head for the}} Atlantis Bank, a {{promising}} location in the southwestern Indian Ocean on the Southwest Indian Ridge, to attempt to drill an initial bore hole to a depth of approximately 1.5 kilometres.The attempt did not even reach 1.3 km, but researchers hope to further their investigations at a later date.|$|E
5000|$|On November 3, 1989, the 5-inch {{drill pipe}} {{had reached a}} depth of 3,707 feet. The rig {{had been in the}} {{tropical}} storm since the Tuesday 31 October electric logging was performed. The superintendent ignored all warnings of the storm saying [...] "There hasn't been a typhoon for 50 years in the Gulf of Thailand, so keep working". There was 12500 ft of drill-pipe in the derrick and the rig was out of survey since the top-drve had been installed. What follows id all wrong. The <b>drill-ship</b> was lost due to criminal negilgence. The superintendent's report stated that winds and seas increased at approximately 0100 hours {{on the day of the}} capsize. The increasing severity of the weather forced the rig workers to hang the drill pipe in the hole on the lower rams. It was determined from the morning report that drilling activities ceased around midnight. By 0300 the drill pipe in the hole was hanging on the lower rams. The rig workers, however, did not have time to lay down the 90 foot lengths of drill pipe that remained in the derrick.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} drill-ships were {{established}} at the main seaports around the coasts of Great Britain and Ireland, and seamen left their vessels to undertake gunnery training in a <b>drill-ship</b> for one month every year. After initial shore training, officers embarked in larger ships of the Royal Navy's fleet (usually battleships or battle cruisers) for one year, to familiarise themselves with gunnery and naval practice. Although under the operational authority of the Admiral Commanding Reserves, the RNR was administered jointly by the Admiralty and the Registrar General of Shipping and Seamen at the Board of Trade throughout its separate existence. In 1910, the RNR (Trawler Section) was formed to recruit and train fishermen for wartime service in minesweepers and other small warships.Officers and men of the RNR soon gained the respect of their naval counterparts with their professional skills in navigation and seamanship and served with distinction {{in a number of}} conflicts, including the Boer War and the Boxer Rebellion. Prior to the First World War, one hundred RNR officers were transferred to permanent careers in the regular navy—forever after referred to as [...] "the hungry hundred". In their professional careers, many RNR officers went on to command the largest passenger liners of the day and some also held senior positions in the shipping industry and the government.|$|E
40|$|The Simple Cabled Instrument for Measuring Parameters in-situ (SCIMPI) {{is a new}} {{borehole}} observatory instrument {{designed to}} study dynamic processes below the seafloor. SCIMPI performs time series measurements of temperature, pressure and electrical resistivity at a series of depths, tailored for site-specific scientific objectives. SCIMPI’s modular design enables tailoring of the type, depth distribution, and frequency of measurements based on the study goals and sediment characteristics. The first prototype is designed for 300 m below the seafloor in soft sediment and 1500 mb. s. l. However, SCIMPI could be tailored for deeper goals. The instrument can be configured for autonomous or cabled observatory deployments and has successfully undergone a number of tests, including pressure, communications, battery life, and interfacing with other <b>drill-ship</b> equipment. Here we discuss {{the design of the}} instrument, its capabilities, and the testing process it has passed through during four years of development. SCIMPI was successfully deployed on the Cascadia margin within the NEPTUNE Canada observatory network during IODP Expedition 341 S in May 2013...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{versatility}} {{of discrete}} element method (DEM) in modelling ice-related problems is discussed and further demonstrated using {{the results from}} the DEM works conducted by the National Research Council 2 ̆ 019 s Institute for Ocean Technology (NRC-IOT) using a commercial code DECICE. These works include a wide range of ice-structure and ice-ship interaction problems of current interest, i. e. ice loads on conical structures, jamming of floes at bridge piers, modelling of the mechanical behaviour of ice rubble, pack ice stability and associated forces on offshore structures, rubble loads exerted on an inclined retaining wall, ridge keel resistance during seabed scouring, dynamic response of a moored conical <b>drill-ship</b> in ice and ship manoeuvring performance in ice. Representative simulations for each case are presented including load, motion and/or interaction process, whichever is appropriate. The simulations from DECICE were compared with experimental data and found satisfactory in terms of accuracy and real-time simulation capability. The accuracy is important for design and engineering of marine structures and ships, whereas the real-time simulation capability allows it to be used in marine simulators for personnel training and marine operation assessment. The performance of DECICE is also addressed and improved via the implementation of a new contact detection sequence and parallel considerations. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Sea-ice {{concentration}} in the central Arctic Ocean is typically 85 – 95 % during summers and much of this ice consists of 2 – 5 m thich multi-year ice. The Arctic Coring Expedition (ACEX, IODP Exp. 302) operated continuously in > 90 % ice cover while on site, which was dominated by multi-year ice. The primary goal of ACEX was to continuously recover a > 400 m thich sediment sequence draping {{the crest of the}} Lomonosov Ridge in the central Arctic Ocean between 87 °N and 88 °N. This would meet the fundamental paleoceanographic objective of ACEX, namely to determine the Cenozoic paleoenvironmental evolution in the central Arctic Ocean. ACEX was executed using three platforms: Vidar Viking (drilling platform), Oden (support icbreaker, operational HQ, research lab and science center), and Sovetskiy Soyuz (nuclear support icebreaker). Over a period of 22. 5 days from August 15 th to September 5 th, the <b>drill-ship</b> lept its position over site in about 1200 m water depth for 15. 1 days (~ 97 % of the time within ± 50 m) through manual steering of the ship. During that period, three scientists were helicoptered to/from the <b>drill-ship</b> twice/day. Three sites were drilled along a single reflection seismic profile (AWI- 91090) showing a coherent seismostratigraphy. Ice drift determined the exact drilling location. A total of 495. 47 m was cored, resulting in a recovery of 339. 06 m in 110 XCB-cores and 8 APC-cores (68 % recovery). The deepest hole was terminated at 427. 9 mbsf. Preliminary analyses of about 4 % of these sediments were made onboard the Oden during the offshore phase. The remaining sections were subsequently split and described by the onshore science party at Bremen University. Biogenic carbonate were encountered only in the Holocene and uppermost Pleistocene sections. The Pleistocene and Neogene sections show biogenic components. It follows that the central Arctic Ocean was not a sediment starved basin during these times. A 22 m thich (171 - 193 mbsf) palynologically barren interval separates the overlying middle Miocene from the underlying middle Eocene, which presumably preserves some of the intervening lower Neogene and upper Paleogene sections. Sand lenses occur frequently down to 198 mbsf (middle Miocene) and cm-sized pebbles occur more or less continuously down to 239 mbsf (middle Eocene). Both sand and pebbles are interpreted to represent ice-rafted debris. The average sedimentation rate in the middle Eocene to uppermost Paleocene section is about 1. 6 cm/ka. A 107 m thick middle to upper lower Eocene interval hosts rich biosiliceous assemblages in which radiolarians by-and-large are missing, probably indicating reduces surface water salinities. The lower Eocene to uppermost Paleocene interval, below the biosilica interval, consists of dark clays/shales often showing sub-mm laminations and presence of pyrite nodules. The transition to the underlying sedimentary bedrock was not sampled because of recovery problems. The oldest sediment sampled consists of 1. 39 m of shallow-marine dark layey mud of Campanian age...|$|E
