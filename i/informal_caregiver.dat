40|$|Objectives: Geriatric patients' {{physical}} disabilities, {{dependency on}} care, and possible psychological ill-being may negatively affect both the patient's {{quality of life}} and the <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver</b> burden. Focusing on this interrelationship which can be particularly prominent in geriatric patients with stroke, the objective {{of this study was to}} identify determinants of patients' {{quality of life and}} <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver</b> burden. Method: This is a prospective, multicentre, cohort study. Data were collected in 84 geriatric home-dwelling patients with stroke three months after their rehabilitation period in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). We assessed patients' quality of life, depressive complaints, neuropsychiatric symptoms, balance, (instrumental) activities of daily living, and <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver</b> burden. Linear regression models were constructed to study the association between the variables. Results: For several domains, high quality of life of these geriatric patients was associated with high functional independence, less neuropsychiatric symptoms, and less depressive complaints. <b>Informal</b> <b>caregiver</b> burden was not associated with patients' quality of life, but patients' neuropsychiatric symptoms were a significant determinant of high <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver</b> burden. Conclusion: The presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms (more specifically depressive complaints) negatively affects the quality of life of geriatric patients. Their neuropsychiatric symptoms also affect caregiver burden. Health care professionals in SNFs can play an important role in providing the necessary psychosocial support and aftercare...|$|E

Differences will be investigated in (a) problems experienced in the provision of informal care, (b) the use of ambulatory types of professional support, and (c) the need for additional professional support. Results are based on a survey among 1494 Dutch <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers.</b> Almost all <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> experience problems in caring for a person with dementia, irrespective of the stage of the illness process.

40|$|The {{implications}} for society of increasing life span to 120 years {{can only be}} guessed, but comparing the diversity of responses to aging in different countries may give insights into the possible effect. A European Union–funded study of the recipients of community care services in 11 European countries illustrates how such studies can help identify some of the issues. The study, {{made possible by the}} availability of a multidimensional standardized assessment for community care, illustrates how diversity of social and political history and culture results in widely different patterns of dependency in those cared for at home, different levels of formal care, and <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver</b> burden. There is wide variation in living arrangements, marital status, and dependency between countries. The average age of recipients of community care is approximately 82, regardless of {{the average age of the}} national population.

40|$|Title: Information {{exchange}} with professionals in dementia decision-making: views of <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> Background: Worldwide, {{there are an}} estimated 24 million people with dementia. The majority lives at home and are largely dependent of <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers.</b> <b>Informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> are increasingly involved in care decisions for persons with dementia. Barriers to make such decisions include lack of information exchange and support. This creates unnecessary stress in <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers.</b> Shared decision-making, when facilitated by professionals, can support adequate information exchange, enabling <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> to make care decisions. Aim and research question: In order to gain insight into the role of professionals in information exchange, informal caregivers’ views on professionals regarding exchanging information in care decisions should be examined. This insight might result in indications for adequate information exchange between <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> and professionals. Method: This qualitative study was conducted using the principles of the Grounded Theory approach. The study population consisted of <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> of persons with dementia from the Netherlands who were part of a dementia care network. The software Atlas. ti was used. Results: Informal caregivers’ views on professionals regarding information exchange in decision-making are depended on the nature of involvement. Professionals were considered to be either actively or passively involved. <b>Informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> were positive about information exchange of actively involved professionals. The information exchange of passively involved professionals was too often not consistent with their needs. Conclusion: The information exchange of professionals was too often not appropriate. Many decisions were discussed by <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> with members of the care network, but these decisions were not indisputably based on shared decision-making. Decisions were mainly based on good sense and gut feeling. Recommendations: Improvement of expertise for professionals regarding dementia and support during the process of information exchange in decision-making, to ensure <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> are equal partners in decision-making...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Continuity of care is {{essential}} {{when trying to}} avoid untimely institutionalization of the frail elderly. Either continuously or occasionally, multiple care providers {{are involved in the}} integrated care for a community-dwelling frail older person. In this coming and going of care providers over time, the <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver</b> usually remains the constant factor. In 2009 the Belgian Federal Government launched a call for innovative projects that aim at maintaining the community-dwelling frail elderly at home for as long as possible. That call resulted in 66 projects that offer a variety of innovative interventions. Aims: The aim {{of this study is to}} describe to what extent these projects involve the informal caregivers in the organization of care for the frail elderly. Methods: Data are collected through the projects initial application files, yearly questionnaires, interviews and focus groups. We performed a descriptive analysis of the data and compared subgroups of projects based on the type of interventions. Results: First results show that in most projects involvement of the <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver</b> in the care process is not well established. A minority of projects describe how they plan to implement caregiver involvement in their application files. Caregiver involvement mainly occurs sporadically, when important decisions about an individual client have to be made.

Little is known about <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver</b> involvement in treatment planning or how such involvement might affect health care delivery and receipt. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate patient perspectives on <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver</b> involvement in treatment planning, including the perceived consequences of others' involvement. Forty-two predominantly African American HIV-positive adults who were partnered at the time of diagnosis were recruited in 2005 from infectious disease clinics in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the monetary value of providing informal care {{by means of}} a well-being valuation method. This is done by assessing the compensating variation necessary to maintain the same level of well-being after an <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver</b> provides an extra hour of informal care. The informal caregiver’s well-being is proxied by the answer to two subjective well-being questions that were posed in a questionnaire answered by 865 Dutch informal caregivers between the end of 2001 and the beginning of 2002. In the econometric analysis, a distinction is made between the care recipients who are and the ones who are not a family member of the <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver.</b> The results indicate that an extra hour of informal care is worth about 9 or 10 Euros. This equals 8 or 9 Euros if the care recipient is a family member and about 7 or 9 Euros if not. When applying the contingent valuation method to the same sample, the value obtained was 10. 52 Euros per hour. This paper concludes that the well-being valuation method is a useful complement to the more traditional valuation methods in the health economics literature in general and more particularly for the economic valuation of informal care: it includes all costs and effects associated with providing care {{from the perspective of the}} <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver,</b> it is relatively cheap to implement, and it offers an additional possibility to determine the convergent validity of the different monetary valuation methods...|$|E

Providing support to <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> is essential to promote their wellbeing and prevent serious caregiver burden. The aim of the study is to investigate whether differences occur between the initial and later stages of dementia in terms of (1) problems experienced by <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> in the provision of care, (2) use of professional support by persons with dementia, (3) informal caregivers' needs for additional professional support. Methods: The data were collected {{within the framework of the}} Dutch National Dementia Program, which was instigated in 2005 by the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport to improve integrated care for people with dementia and their <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers.</b> This paper is based on data of a questionnaire survey among 1494 <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers,</b> collected between September 2007 and December 2008.

In later stages, <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> more often experienced problems in their social networks. Most dementia patients (87 - 94 %) received ambulatory professional support. Conclusions: Since <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> indicate a need for additional professional support in all stages of dementia, professional support should be provided during the entire illness process. <b>Informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> need advice on how to cope with symptoms of dementia, how to deal with behavior problems and receive more information about (early and advanced stages of) dementia and the supply of support. © Zwaanswijk et al...|$|R

Background The number of informal caregivers of older adults, including people living with dementia, is growing worldwide. Good medication management by informal caregivers contributes to improved health outcomes and reduced institutionalisations for the care recipient; however, little is known about this domain of care. Design Narrative review. Methods A literature search was conducted to identify relevant research articles written in English between January 2000 -April 2013, sourced from online database searches using multiple keywords, reviewing reference lists and citations of key articles and Internet searches. Articles were included if they described <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver</b> medication management for older adults and/or people living with dementia. Results Ten articles were found that described this role {{from the perspective of the}} <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver.</b> The evidence suggests that this role is complex and is often made more difficult because of increasing medication regimen complexities, aspects of the relationship between the caregiver and the care recipient, healthcare system practices and a lack of information and/or training available to the <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver,</b> especially when caring for people living with dementia.

The central hypothesis was that older women’s level of functioning is influenced by their relationship with their <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver.</b> The study attempted to understand the independence of older women through the perspective of both informal caregivers and the older women themselves. The following eight variables were measured: 1) the older women’s independence (dependent variable); 2) the relationship between older women and their informal caregivers (independent variable); 3) roles of both the <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver</b> and older women (independent variable); 4) the older women’s attitudes toward aging (independent variable); 5) the older women’s age identity (independent variable); 6) the older women’s health (control variable); 7) the older women’s level of social support (control variable); and 8) the older women’s level of depression (control variable).

40|$|Background: It is {{believed}} that timely recognition and diagnosis of dementia is a pre-condition for improving care for both older adults with dementia and their <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers.</b> However, diagnosing dementia often occurs late in the disease. This means {{that a significant number}} of patients with early symptoms of dementia and their <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> may lack appropriate care. Objectives: To compare the effects of case management and usual care among community-dwelling older adults with early symptoms of dementia and their primary <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers.</b> Design: Randomized controlled trial with measurements at baseline and after 6 and 12 months. Setting: Primary care in West-Friesland, the Netherlands. Participants: 99 pairs of community-dwelling older adults with dementia symptoms (defined as abnormal screening for symptoms of dementia) and their primary <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers.</b> Intervention: 12 months of case management by district nurses for both older adults and <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> versus usual care. Measurements: Primary outcome: <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver's</b> sense of competence. Secondary outcomes: caregiver's quality of life, depressive symptoms, and burden, and patient's quality of life. Process measurements: intervention fidelity and caregiver's satisfaction with the quality of case management. Results: Linear mixed model analyses showed no statistically significant and clinically relevant differences over time between the two groups. The process evaluation revealed that intervention fidelity could have been better. Meanwhile, <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> were satisfied with the quality of case management. Conclusion: This study shows no benefits of case management for older adults with dementia symptoms and their primary <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers.</b> One possible explanation is that case management, which has been recommended among diagnosed dementia patients, may not be beneficial if offered too early. However, on the other hand, it is possible that: (1) case management will be effective in this group if more fully implemented and adapted or aimed at <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> who experience more severe distress and problems; (2) case management is beneficial but that it is not seen in the timeframe studied; (3) case management might have undetected small benefits.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{examine the}} impact of changes in an older person's frailty on the care-related quality of life of their <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver.</b> METHODS: Five {{research}} projects in the TOPICS-MDS database with data of both older person and <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver</b> at baseline and after 12 months follow-up were selected. Frailty was measured in five health domains (functional limitations, psychological well-being, social functioning, health-related quality of life, self-rated health). Care-related quality of life was measured with the Care-Related Quality of Life instrument (CarerQoL- 7 D), containing two positive (fulfilment, perceived support) and five negative dimensions (relational problems, mental health problems, physical health problems, financial problems, problems combining informal care with daily activities). RESULTS: 660 older person/caregiver couples were included. Older persons were on average 79 (SD 6. 9) years of age, and 61 % was female. Caregivers were on average 65 (SD 12. 6) years of age, and 68 % was female. Results of the multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses showed that an increase in older person's frailty over time was related to a lower total care-related quality of life of the caregiver, and to more mental and physical health problems, and problems with combining informal care with daily activities at follow-up. A change in the older person's psychological well-being was most important for the caregiver's care-related quality of life, compared to the other health domains.

40|$|Background: The {{outcomes}} of informal caregivers of survivors of critical illness likely depend on patient characteristics, which may change over time. To date, {{few studies have}} examined patient-specific predictors of post-ICU <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver</b> burden, and none has tested whether predictors vary after hospital discharge. Methods: We designed a prospective, longitudinal observational study, enrolling 48 patient-caregiver dyads from four ICUs in a university hospital. <b>Informal</b> <b>caregiver</b> depression symptoms were measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Lifestyle disruption was measured with the Activity Restriction Scale. Linear regression models were built to test for patient- and caregiver-specific predictors of depression symptoms and lifestyle disruption 2, 6, and 12 months after ICU admission. Results: Patients had a mean (SD) age of 52. 5 (19. 7) years, 67 % were men, median (interquartile range) Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation score was 52 (38. 5, 65). The caregivers had a mean (SD) age of 52. 8 (12. 8) years, 91. 2 % were women, and 48 % were spouses. Predictors of caregiver depression symptoms were patient gender (men) at 2 and 12 months and tracheostomy at 12 months. Predictors of lifestyle disruption were patient education (more common among high school graduates) and patient gender (men) at 2 months, and tracheostomy, functional dependency, and patient gender (men) at 12 months. Conclusions: The determinants of post-ICU <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver</b> burden likely depend on characteristics of the patient as well as the caregiver and may vary over time.

Methods The participants in {{this retrospective cohort study}} were 151 family caregivers of patients who had died approximately 9 months prior to the study telephone interview. The interview focused on the last year of life and covered two main areas, patient characteristics and <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver</b> characteristics. Results Odds ratios [OR] and 95 % confidence intervals [95 % CI] were used to determine which of the 15 potential <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver</b> and seven patient predictor variables were associated with dying at home. Multivariate analysis revealed that the odds of dying at home were greater when the patient lived with a caregiver [OR = 7. 85; 95 % CI = (2. 35, 26. 27) ], the patient stated a preference to die at home [OR= 6. 51; 95 % CI = (2. 66, 15. 95) ], and the family physician made home visits [OR = 4. 79; 95 % CI = (1. 97, 11. 64) ].

40|$|Background: Dementelcoach {{is a new}} {{telephone}} {{intervention to}} support <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> of community-dwelling people with dementia. The effectiveness of this intervention was evaluated on burden and mental health problems of <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers.</b> Methods: A pre-test/post-test comparison group design was used with three groups of <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers.</b> Two of the groups were experimental and received either (1) telephone coaching or (2) telephone coaching in combination with respite care (psychogeriatric day care); the third was a comparison group which received day care only. Telephone coaching was offered by trained coaches once {{every two to three}} weeks over a period of 20 weeks. Results: <b>Informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> who received telephone coaching in combination with respite care reported significantly less burden compared to caregivers who received telecoaching only, and they experienced significantly fewer mental health problems than those who received day care only. Conclusion: Telecoaching according to the principles of Dementelcoach combined with respite care (psychogeriatric day care) is more effective in reducing burden and health complaints in <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> of community-dwelling people with dementia than telecoaching or day care only. © 2011 International Psychogeriatric Association...|$|R
40|$|Under the Direction of Thomas Coleman) This {{study is}} {{designed}} to develop and test a potential needs assessment process that states and localities could use to make decisions regarding financial and staff budgeting related to <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver</b> turnover rates. More specifically, this needs assessment is derived from a model of factors expected to influence turnover rates of informal caregivers enrolled in the Childcare and Parent Services (CAPS) subsidy program in Georgia counties. Factors tested included amount spent on child care per person, percent of child care options that are informal care, number of child care workshops, average family size, mean education level of the county, number of higher education institutions, and high school drop out rates. Regression analysis were run using the full sample of all 159 counties in Georgia {{as well as on}} subsets of counties that were rural growth/rural decline and urban/suburban. In each of the analysis the only variable that was predictive of <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver</b> turnover rate was amount spent on low income child care per person in the county...|$|E
40|$|According to the dialectical model, the {{well-being}} of the older care recipient, the <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver,</b> and the professional care provider mutually affect each other. Particularly, the caregiver’s strain can affect the care recipient’s well-being both positively and negatively. Moreover, the task-specific model suggests that as social workers are responsible for maintaining elders ’ well-being, the workers ’ strain would be particu-larly influential on the elders ’ well-being. To clarify these dialectic relationships, the present study surveyed the three parties involved in home help or home care services in Hong Kong over two successive waves using a panel design. This study reveals the significant negative effect the professional care provider’s earlier strain has on the elder’s later well-being. Moreover, the social worker’s earlier strain was particularly detrimental to the elder’s later well-being. In contrast, the effect of the informal caregiver’s earlier strain was not significant. Additionally, the elder’s well-being had no significant impact on the strain of either the professional care provider or the <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver.</b> Findings of this study support the qualification of the dialectical model by the task-specific model to yield a model of channeled spillover. Accordingly, dialectical influence requires a channel to materialize the spillover effect...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Dementia care in The Netherlands is {{shifting}} from fragmented, ad hoc care to more coordinated and personalized care. Case management contributes to this shift. The linkage model and {{a combination of}} intensive case management and joint agency care models were selected based on their emerging prominence in The Netherlands. It is unclear if these different forms of case management are more effective than usual care in improving or preserving the functioning and well-being at the patient and caregiver level and at the societal cost. OBJECTIVE: The objective {{of this article is}} to describe the design of a study comparing these two case management care models against usual care. Clinical and cost outcomes are investigated while care processes and the facilitators and barriers for implementation of these models are considered. DESIGN: Mixed methods include a prospective, observational, controlled, cohort study among persons with dementia and their primary <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver</b> in regions of The Netherlands with and without case management including a qualitative process evaluation. Community-dwelling individuals with a dementia diagnosis with an <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver</b> are included. The primary outcome measure is the Neuropsychiatric Inventory for the people with dementia and the General Health Questionnaire for their caregivers. Costs are measured from a societal perspective. Semi-structured interviews with stakeholders based on the theoretical model of adaptive implementation are planned. RESULTS: 521 pairs of persons with dementia and their primary <b>informal</b> <b>caregiver</b> were included and are followed over two years. In the linked model substantially more impeding factors for implementation were identified compared with the model. DISCUSSION: This article describes the design of an evaluation study of two case management models along with clinical and economic data from persons with dementia and caregivers. The impeding and facilitating factors differed substantially between the two models. Further results on cost-effectiveness are expected by the beginning of 2015. This is a Dutch adaptation of MacNeil Vroomen et al., Comparing Dutch case management care models for people with dementia and their caregivers: The design of the COMPAS study...|$|E
40|$|An 8 -item {{scale has}} been {{developed}} to measure positive experiences by <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers,</b> the Positive Experiences Scale (PES). The PES is a unidimensional hierarchical Mokkenscale which varies from intrinsic satisfaction and relational enhancement to improvement of competence and social enhancement. The scale has a satisfactory Loevinger's H-value (0. 37) and reliability (0. 74). Furthermore, satisfying H-values are found for large groups of <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers,</b> such as carers for the elderly, the chronically ill, partners, parents and {{people who live in}} a care facility. For <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> of people with dementia or mental impairments, two items do not uphold ('I received appreciation for the care I've been giving' and 'the help brought me and my family and friends closer together'. For these groups a 6 -item scale is advised. Solely for <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> of people with psychological impairments, the scale as a whole does not uphold. Further research will have to determine how these caregivers derive positive experiences from caregiving. The PES is recommended because of its psychometric qualities and its usefulness in different populations of <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers...</b>|$|R
40|$|The sequels {{caused by}} {{neurological}} diseases, especially the medullar injuries and the stroke, can generate great impacts {{in the quality}} of life of the persons which work as <b>informal</b> patient <b>caregivers.</b> The aim of this study was to evaluate {{the quality of life of}} persons which work as <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> of patients with neurological sequels from medullar injuries or stroke. Twenty volunteers were selected and divided in two groups: the first group (n= 9) was composed by <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> of patients with stroke or medullar injury, and the second was a control group, constituted by volunteers (n= 11) which were not working as caregivers. All volunteers were evaluated and submitted to a quality of life evaluation by means of the SF- 36 Health Survey. The results showed a significant decrease in the majority SF- 36 domains for <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> group in comparison with control group. Thus, it can be concluded that <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> presented a decrease in health's quality when compared to individuals of control group...|$|R
30|$|Reforms in the Dutch {{healthcare}} system {{in combination with}} the aging of the population will lead to a strong increase in the demand for informal care in the Netherlands. A hip fracture {{is one of the most}} important causes of hospital admissions among frail elderly and <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> experience stress that may have significantly negative impact on the caregivers’ Quality of Life. The purpose of the study was to determine the nature, intensity and the care-related Quality of Life (CarerQoL) of <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> of elderly patients in the first six months after a hip fracture. In this cross-sectional study, were interviewed the primary <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> of patients with a hip fracture about the informal care provided after one, three or six months following the injury. The CarerQoL of the <b>informal</b> <b>caregivers</b> was measured with the CarerQoL- 7 D instrument.|$|R
