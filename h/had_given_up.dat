5|$|In 1938 Imogen {{decided to}} abandon amateur music-making and {{teaching}} {{to concentrate on}} her own professional development. She resigned her EFDSS post while continuing to honour existing commitments to the organisation. She <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> her work at Roedean in 1936; at Easter 1939 she resigned from Eothen. In June 1939 she began a tour of Switzerland which included the Lucerne Festival. Towards the end of August, as war became increasingly likely, she broke off the trip and returned home.|$|E

5|$|In the 1930s, Meher Baba began {{a period}} of {{extensive}} world travel, with several trips to Europe and the United States. It was during this period that he established contact with his first close group of Western disciples. He traveled on a Persian passport because he <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> writing as well as speaking and would not sign the forms required by the British government of India.|$|E
5|$|Once, {{while working}} at the Sanitarium, Beilhart was called to the bedside {{of a young girl}} for whom doctors <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> hope. When Beilhart prayed for her, she {{experienced}} a quick and complete recovery. Beilhart's conviction that faith-healing was the remedy for illness put him in disfavor with the sanitarium officials and he was asked to resign.|$|E
5|$|Although Æthelred {{had been}} Eardwulf's enemy, Æthelred's killers {{proved to be}} equally hostile to Eardwulf. In 798 a dux named Wada, {{who was one of}} those who had killed King Æthelred, fought with Eardwulf on Billington Moor, near Whalley, Lancashire. Wada was put to flight and may have gone into exile in Mercia. He may have hoped to restore Osbald to the throne. The {{evidence}} for Osbald's continued ambition is a letter that Alcuin wrote to him, probably in 798, in which Alcuin attempted to dissuade Osbald from further interventions in Northumbrian affairs. Alcuin's arguments appear to have succeeded, since Osbald is known to have become an abbot by 799 (when his death is recorded), implying that he <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> his ambitions.|$|E

5|$|French losses {{numbered}} 2,000 {{killed and}} wounded plus 400 captured. The Austrians suffered 1,300 killed and wounded with 1,300 captured. On 10 July, Charles evacuated Malsch {{and ordered a}} forced march east to Pforzheim via Karlsruhe. Also on the 10th, the French occupied Ettlingen and Neuenbürg. Anxious to protect his magazines at Heilbronn, Charles halted at Pforzheim for a few days. For his part, Moreau would not believe that Charles <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>up,</b> so he waited around Ettlingen for several days. Meanwhile, the Austrians packed their supplies into wagons and headed east on 14 July. The next day, Moreau moved on Pforzheim but found the archduke gone.|$|E
5|$|Having {{believed}} {{that they would be}} participating in Russian's television programme for an entire year, most contestants <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> their homes, jobs and partners—most had to find new employment and some were forced to move in with their parents. Russian went into hiding and was unable to be reached by his victims. On 13 June 2002, Debbie Leigh Driver, one of Russian's contestants, contacted Caz Gorham and Frances Dickenson of the independent production company Christmas TV & Film and told them about the hoax. Gorham and Dickenson produced a genuine TV programme to document the story of the con and how the participants were now trying to get their lives back together, which was shown on Channel 4 in December 2002.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eighth}} inning, Myles Thomas {{came in to}} relieve Shocker, who <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> three hits and two unearned runs {{in less than an}} inning of work. Meanwhile, Alexander shut down the Yankees offense {{for the rest of the}} game. In the top of the ninth inning, the Cardinals {{increased}} their lead back to eight runs after Hornsby had an RBI groundout, scoring Southworth. Alexander finished with his second complete game of the series and gave up only two runs on eight hits, while striking out six batters. The three Yankee pitchers combined to give up thirteen hits, seven earned runs, three unearned runs, and one home run.|$|E

5|$|Initially, some of {{the coal}} carried on the canal had been transported in boats owned by the canal company, but they <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> this {{practice}} in 1812. They resumed carrying coal in 1827, because they felt that coal stocks at Grantham were not adequate, but were accused of price-fixing. Although the penalty imposed by Lincoln Assizes was small, they ceased this trade, and the coal merchants agreed to maintain stocks of 2,660 tons at Grantham. In 1833, J. Rofe and his son made {{a proposal for a}} canal to connect Grantham and Sleaford, but this was not pursued.|$|E
5|$|Melvin served out {{his term}} until October 31, 1906, when he {{suffered}} a stroke while holding a session of the circuit court in Wellsburg. He was paralyzed and lost consciousness {{as a result of}} the stroke, and was assisted from the bench and taken to Wheeling City Hospital in Ward5. By the following day physicians <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> hope for his recovery. Melvin died at 16:00 on November 9, 1906, at the hospital as a result of apoplexy. His body was taken to the McLure Hotel on November 10, where it lay in state until November 12. Melvin was interred next to his father and mother in his family's graveyard at United Methodist Cemetery in his hometown of Fairview (present-day New Manchester) in Hancock County.|$|E
5|$|Siemens {{stated that}} they would not be able to have the {{locomotives}} operational until mid-1999. By February 1999, Siemens <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> trying to fix the locomotives, although they had established that the main fault lay in the generators. The issue never reached the courts. On 5 May 1999, the companies announcement that they had reached an agreement for the trains to be returned to Siemens, and NOK485 million be compensated to NSB. This was in addition to NOK80 million which had already been given as discount. In addition to the purchase price, the compensation included interest and coverage for NSB's extra expenses. The locomotives were immediately dismounted of NSB-owned equipment and on 20May sent by ship to Hamburg.|$|E

Smith pitched one inning, giving up no hits, striking out one and walking two. He finished the season for the last-place Cubs and was invited back to the majors for 1981. He was used mostly as a middle relief pitcher. A streak of poor pitching was interrupted by the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, and he finished with an ERA of 3.51.|$|E
5|$|When Octavian {{returned}} to Rome {{two years after}} defeating Mark Antony, no one remained to oppose him. Decades of war had taken a terrible toll on the People of Rome. The political situation was unstable, {{and there was a}} constant threat of renewed warfare. Octavian's arrival alone caused a wave of optimism to ripple throughout Italy. As soon as he arrived, he began addressing the problems that were plaguing Rome. Octavian's popularity soon reached new heights, which ultimately gave him the support he needed to implement his reforms. When Octavian deposed Mark Antony in 32 BC, he resigned his position as triumvir, but was probably vested with powers similar to those that he <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, David's successes were in {{many ways}} {{balanced}} by his failures. David's greatest disappointment during this time was his inability to ensure control of the bishopric of Durham and the archbishopric of York. David had attempted to appoint his chancellor, William Comyn, to the bishopric of Durham, which had been vacant {{since the death of}} Bishop Geoffrey Rufus in 1140. Between 1141 and 1143, Comyn was the de facto bishop, and had control of the bishop's castle; but he was resented by the chapter. Despite controlling the town of Durham, David's only hope of ensuring his election and consecration was gaining the support of the Papal legate, Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester and brother of King Stephen. Despite obtaining the support of the Empress Matilda, David was unsuccessful and <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> by the time William de St Barbara was elected to the see in 1143.|$|E

5|$|Later, it was {{announced}} that should a sequel or reboot not start filming by October 10, 2012, the rights to the Daredevil franchise would revert from Fox back to Marvel. In early August 2012, Fox scrambled to find a replacement for David Slade, who dropped out of the director's chair due to scheduling conflicts. The studio briefly met with Joe Carnahan, for the job—however, Carnahan said on Twitter that his pitch, described as a hard-boiled '70s thriller, had gone up in smoke. Several sources commented that Fox <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> on the reboot, and were prepared to let the rights revert to Marvel and their parent company, The Walt Disney Company. On April 23, 2013, Kevin Feige confirmed that the rights for Daredevil returned to Marvel Studios and Disney, opening the possibility of including the character into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That speculation was confirmed with the announcement of an original Netflix Daredevil television series, which premiered on the streaming service in April 2015, with English actor Charlie Cox in the title role.|$|E
5|$|On March 28 North Vietnamese forces {{closed in}} on Da Nang, and they {{subjected}} Da Nang Air Base to heavy artillery bombardment. Under adverse conditions, the Republic of Vietnam Air Force was able to fly about 130 aircraft out of the city, {{but they had to}} abandon 180 aircraft, including 33 A-37 Dragonflys, due to chaos, confusion, poor discipline and the breakdown of airfield security. On March 29, the North Vietnamese captured Da Nang, followed by Quy Nhon on April 1 and Tuy Hòa and Nha Trang on April 2. At Phan Rang Air Base, remnants of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force continued to battle North Vietnamese troops for two days after ground units of the ARVN <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> the fight. Elements of the ARVN Airborne Division were also committed into the fight, but they were overwhelmed by the North Vietnamese and Phan Rang was captured on April 16.|$|E

Before Case {{took over in}} September 1994, the character was portrayed briefly by Monica Potter and then by Heidi Mark. When first introduced, Sharon {{was a young girl}} from the poor side of town. Nick and Sharon married, had a son named Noah, and later won custody of Cassie, the child a teenaged Sharon <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> for adoption. Their marriage faced a number of problems, including infidelity on both sides. Following Cassie's death in an automobile accident, Nick cheated on Sharon with Phyllis Summers, resulting in a pregnancy which ended their 11-year marriage.|$|E
