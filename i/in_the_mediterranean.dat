5|$|Ark Royal and {{the ships}} of Force H {{returned}} to Gibraltar on 29 May 1941. Despite the boost in Allied morale from {{the sinking of}} the battleship Bismarck, the war <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> was going against the Allies. Greece and Crete had fallen to the Axis Powers, and the Afrika Korps was preparing to launch a final push into Egypt. Malta remained an important stronghold <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mediterranean,</b> but was coming under increased pressure from Italian and German air attacks, and could no longer be supplied from the east since the fall of Crete.|$|E

During this period, Edgar Quinet {{took part in the}} Battle of Antivari in August 1914, and Waldeck-Rousseau was unsuccessfully attacked twice by Austro-Hungarian U-boats. Waldeck-Rousseau participated in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War in the Black Sea in 1919–22, while Edgar Quinet remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> during the contemporaneous Greco-Turkish War.|$|E

5|$|Patchy {{records from}} around the world {{indicate}} the bignose shark probably has a circumglobal distribution in tropical and subtropical waters.

It is reportedly common off Florida, the Bahamas, and the West Indies, and rare off Brazil and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mediterranean.</b>|$|E
5|$|The British and Americans {{agreed to}} {{continue}} to press the initiative <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> by invading Sicily to fully secure the Mediterranean supply routes. Although the British argued for further operations in the Balkans to bring Turkey into the war, in May 1943, the Americans extracted a British commitment to limit Allied operations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> to an invasion of the Italian mainland and to invade France in 1944.|$|E
