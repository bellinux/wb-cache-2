The paper first introduces the notion of (m; k) -firm <b>deadlines</b> to better characterize the timing constraints of real-time streams.

40|$|Traditional {{real-time}} scheduling algorithms typically {{assume that}} <b>deadlines</b> of tasks {{do not change}} with time.

40|$|Like {{most other}} types of human activity, {{international}} legal practice relies heavily on <b>deadlines.</b> Yet <b>deadlines</b> have received very little attention in international legal scholarship. This is the case even though <b>deadlines</b> are heavily studied in other contexts, with research finding that people tend to set and respond to <b>deadlines</b> in ways consistent with bounded rather than perfect rationality. This book chapter takes up the topic of <b>deadlines</b> in international legal practice and makes four contributions. First, using the Chemical Weapons Convention as a case study, it explores various ways in which <b>deadlines</b> are used in international legal practice and highlights just how pervasive they can be. Second, it reviews some behavioral research on <b>deadlines</b> in other contexts and demonstrates that these findings have intriguing parallels with how the Convention’s <b>deadlines</b> have functioned in practice. Third, it assesses the evidence available for evaluating the relevance of domestic research to international affairs in relation to <b>deadlines.</b> The chapter argues that, even though this evidence is currently limited, legal actors {{would do well to}} factor this research into their decision-making about how to structure and respond to <b>deadlines.</b> Finally, the chapter considers {{the extent to which these}} issues are common to both diplomacy and international law...|$|R

40|$|Procrastination {{is all too}} {{familiar}} to most people. People delay writing up their research (so we hear!), repeatedly declare they will start their diets tomorrow, or postpone until next week doing odd jobs around the house. Yet people also sometimes attempt to control their procrastination by setting <b>deadlines</b> for themselves. In this article, we pose three questions: (a) Are people willing to self-impose meaningful (i. e., costly) <b>deadlines</b> to overcome procrastination? (b) Are self-imposed <b>deadlines</b> effective in improving task performance? (c) When self-imposing <b>deadlines,</b> do people set them optimally, for maximum performance enhancement? A set of studies examined these issues experimentally, showing {{that the answer is}} "yes" to the first two questions, and "no" to the third.

40|$|In a deadline-ordered service discipline, packets are {{assigned}} transmission <b>deadlines</b> and are transmitted in increasing order of <b>deadlines.</b> Different deadline-ordered service disciplines are distinguished by how they define <b>deadlines.</b> One {{of the more}} difficult analytical problems one faces when designing a new deadline-ordered service discipline is to prove that one can bound the end of transmission times of packets relative to their assigned <b>deadlines,</b> which we call schedulability. We show that, no matter how one defines <b>deadlines,</b> there is a simple schedulability condition for deadline-ordered service disciplines. This schedulability condition is necessary and sufficient for preemptive deadline-ordered service disciplines and, for a server that allows the presence of non real-time packets (i. e., packets with no <b>deadlines),</b> it is also necessary and sufficient for non-preemptive deadline-ordered service disciplines.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} scheduling realtime traffic in OFDMA systems. We present two heuristics {{with the objective of}} meeting as much <b>deadlines</b> as possible, or equivalently, minimizing the number of missed <b>deadlines.</b> The proposed heuristics decide on the allocation priority, taking into account several known parameters about the users and their service requests, such as the available carriers data rates for each user, the traffic amount and <b>deadlines</b> requirements of each service request. These available parameters are combined together by our heuristics for deciding a priority order by which to schedule the service requests. Specifically, we compare two realtime traffic allocation mechanisms: "per-time slot" scheme and "per-deadline" one. We evaluate our proposed heuristics performance, by means of simulations, computing the <b>deadlines</b> miss ratio (D M R), the percentage of users which miss more than 5 % of <b>deadlines</b> (U M R) and the maximum missed <b>deadlines</b> percentage for the user who missed most (M M D) ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examined}} the relationship of six factors related to the growing problem of missed copy submission <b>deadlines</b> in high school yearbook programs. These factors were: a) the historical tendency for companies to deliver books on time despite missed <b>deadlines,</b> b) the ability of extra-curricular programs to meet <b>deadlines</b> vs. intra-curricular programs, c) the relationship of adviser training to missed <b>deadlines,</b> d) the relationship of complex pages to missed <b>deadlines,</b> e) the relationship of student involvement outside of school to missed <b>deadlines,</b> and f) the relationship of staff motivation to missed <b>deadlines.</b> Six states were identified to represent national trends in the yearbook industry [...] California, Florida, Indiana, Michigan, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. These states offered a regional balance {{as well as one}} inadviser training and in programs delivering books during different seasons. They also reflected the national shares of the major yearbook companies. Surveys were mailed to 1, 200 advisers, 200 in each state. Surveys were mailed to all sales representatives in these states from the six major companies. In addition, each company received a survey requesting statistical information used to define the problem in the study. Follow-up phone interviews were conducted with 13 advisers and 15 representatives. Interviews were also conducted with 12 company employees at three yearbook plants and three company executives by phone. The conclusions of the study showed that missed yearbook <b>deadlines</b> are most directly related to the adviser, his or her attitude toward <b>deadlines,</b> and his or her education and training. It is apparent that while other factors are involved in the issue of missed <b>deadlines,</b> the adviser is the key element in meeting those <b>deadlines.</b> The adviser provides staff motivation and education and is the common link from year to year. It is therefore concluded that adviser training and education is a responsibility of the school system in hiring trained advisers.
