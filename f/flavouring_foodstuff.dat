5000|$|Lao Gan Ma ( [...] ; {{also called}} Laoganma) or Old Godmother is {{a brand of}} chili sauces that are made in China. The sauce is {{produced}} by Laoganma Special <b>Flavour</b> <b>Foodstuffs</b> Company, which was established in 1997. Development of the sauce began in August 1996 by Tao Huabi (陶华碧), who employed 40 people {{at that time in}} a workshop environment. 1.3 million bottles of the sauce are produced daily. The product is sold in China and in over 30 countries. Tao Huabi is the owner of the company, and her son Li Guishan became the first president of the company. Women of China magazine reported in January 2011 that the company's assets were 1.3 billion yuan (US $190 million) and that the company had 2,000 employees at that time.|$|R
2500|$|During the Renaissance, {{truffles}} regained {{popularity in}} Europe and were honoured {{at the court}} of King Francis I of France. However, {{it was not until}} the 17th century that Western (and in particular French) cuisine abandoned [...] "heavy" [...] oriental spices, and rediscovered the natural <b>flavour</b> of <b>foodstuffs.</b> Truffles were very popular in Parisian markets in the 1780s. They were imported seasonally from truffle grounds, where peasants had long enjoyed their secret. Brillat-Savarin (1825) noted characteristically that they were so expensive they appeared only at the dinner tables of great nobles and kept women. A great delicacy was a truffled turkey.|$|R
40|$|The company Fitoplancton Marino S. L. {{requested}} {{authorization to}} market the microalgae Tetraselmis chuii in the European Union as a seafood <b>flavouring</b> agent. This <b>foodstuff</b> has no history of use in any significant quantities in the European Union prior to 1997 and therefore comes {{within the scope of}} Regulation (EC) No 258 / 1997 on novel foods and novel food ingredients. The Scientific Committee of the Spanish Agency for Food safety and Nutrition (AESAN) takes the view that, according to the information provided, {{there is no indication that}} consumption of the species of marine microalgae Tetraselmis chuii as a condiment, under the conditions proposed by the applicant, can produce adverse effects on health. The Committee concludes that the novel foodstuff presented for assessment meets the criteria for acceptance laid down by Regulation (EC) No 258 / 1997 on novel foods and novel food ingredients...|$|R
40|$|We {{report an}} {{experiment}} designed {{to investigate the}} consequences of manipulating the pitch of the background auditory stimulation on the taste of food. The participants {{in the present study}} evaluated four pieces of cinder toffee while listening to two auditory soundtracks, presented in a random order. One soundtrack was designed to be more crossmodally (or "synaesthetically") congruent with a bitter-tasting food whereas the other soundtrack was designed to be more congruent with a sweet-tasting food instead. The participants rated each sample using three computer based line scales: One scale was anchored with the words bitter and sweet. The second scale required participants to localize the taste/flavour percept elicited by the food (at the front vs. back of their mouth). The third scale involved participants giving a hedonic evaluation of the foodstuff. As expected, the cinder toffee samples tasted while listening to the presumptively 'bitter' soundtrack were rated as tasting significantly more bitter than when exactly the same foodstuff was evaluated while listening to the 'sweet' soundtrack instead. These results provide the first convincing empirical demonstration that the crossmodal congruency of a background soundtrack can be used to modify the taste (and presumably also <b>flavour)</b> of a <b>foodstuff.</b> © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Antimicrobial {{activity}} of spices and herbs {{has been known}} and described for several centuries. In recent years, two consumer-driven demands have arisen in the food industry. The first is the provision of fresh and natural foods requiring minimal preparation, while {{the second is the}} control of food safety. Consumer demand has renewed the use of natural food antimicrobial agents for food preservation. Essential oils (EO) and/or their components are becoming increasingly popular as natural antimicrobial agents to be used {{for a wide variety of}} purposes, including food preservation, complementary medicine and natural therapeutics. At present, essential oils are used by the flavouring industry for flavour enhancement and for their antioxidant effect, while the potential use of these oils as natural antimicrobial agents has been less explored. Recently, the antibacterial properties and potential application in foods of essential oils have been reviewed. A number of essential oil components have been registered by the European Commission for use as <b>flavouring</b> in <b>foodstuffs.</b> The flavourings registered are considered to present no risk to the health of the consumer and include amongst others carvacrol, carvone, cinnamaldehyde, citral, p-cymene, eugenol, limonene, menthol and thymol. Active packaging is one of the innovative food packaging concepts that have been introduced as a response to demands of consumers for high quality, safety and extended shelf-life of food products. Antimicrobial active packaging is being increasingly experimented because it is believed to have a significant potential in improving food safety and prolonging the shelf life of food products. The binding of antimicrobial agents directly to polymeric packaging is an exciting development, which allows industry to combine the preservative functions of antimicrobials with the protective functions of the pre-existing packaging concepts. This work is a preliminary study addressed to develop antimicrobial plastic packages by using essential oils and/or their components showing the best antimicrobial performances. The activation method used for the production of antimicrobial plastic films will be reported as inclusion method. In this method the EOs have been carried into the polymer matrix by using nanoparticles (i. e. organo-modified montmorillonite) during the extrusion process. Nanocomposite blends were prepared containing 5 wt% of nanomer I. 28 and 10 wt% of carvacrol, citral, limonene, citronellale and thymol; the doped polymer pellets were pressed at 180 °C to obtain thin films which were subjected to mechanical characterization, morphological observation, oxygen permeability and antimicrobial activity tests. Antimicrobial tests showed that films containing carvacrol and citronellale were active against brochotrix thermosphacta, thus encouraging further investigation on this type of active packaging...|$|R
