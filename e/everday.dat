This suggests that victims and witnesses of stressful crimes are no more likely to create false memories of the crime than they are to create false memories of other <b>everday</b> events.|$|E

The rest of the cast is composed mostly of unprofessional actors, all of whom deliver very convincing performances and add a lot of color and depth to the film. Reminiscent of an Pedro Almodóvar picture, Caramel is unique not just for its technical and creative sophistication but also for not tackling any of the religious, political, or war-related issues that have continued to plague its setting, Lebanon, til now.

50|$|There {{are various}} types and styles of yoga pants in {{addition}} to the traditional. The flared yoga pants are also commonly used as dancewear allowing it to stretch and for the ease of movement it affords. They also typically have combinations of stretchy fabric blends offered by lycra spandex and nylon giving the pants a rich and silky appearance and feel when worn. Crop-fitted yoga pants lie above the ankle (similar to capri pants), and are oftentimes utilized for a more flattering, versatile, and dressier look during warmer times of the year. They are used commonly as casual wear, activewear, for making errands, lounging, or as clubwear on a night out. The flared yoga pants are often paired with flip-flops, running shoes, flats, or Ugg boots, worn along with hoodies, shawls, cardigans or wraps paired with a tank top or shirt tucked underneath. Due to their high elasticity, yoga pants are comfortable enough to wear for many purposes. They were originally created for practicing yoga, but have become popular as <b>everday</b> mainstream clothing item in classrooms, gymnasiums, restaurants, shopping malls, and nightclubs.|$|E
5000|$|Kubler {{says that}} [...] "Today {{the artist is}} neither a rebel nor an entertainer."(53) he {{explains}} how art is affected by different personalities. He explains how more social personalities work well in music and theatre while introverted personalities are more common in visual art. However, even within visual art {{a certain amount of}} sociability allows for artists to be more in tune with their clients and rivals. The social artist has even been used as a kind of entertainment in royal houses. He has also used social characteristics to rebel. However, Kubler ends the section saying that the artist no longer functions as an entertainer or rebel. [...] "More lonely than ever, the artist today is like Dedalus, the strange artificer of wonderful and frightening surprises for his immediate circle."(53) The revelation of the prime is often revealed in hindsight when history presents itself distant and more easily observed. The momementary actions of our <b>everday</b> lives are herald by a much greater force of previous history. Therefore each action is a compression and replication of the past. The unique personality reforms the replica as prime by an erosion of its former manifestation understanding of its conceptual replication and places it within contemporary language.|$|E

5000|$|Advertising plays a {{major role}} in {{creating}} a consumerist society, as goods are marketed through various platforms in nearly all aspects of life, pushing the message that the viewer's life is in need of some product. Consumerism is discussed in detail in the textbook, Media in <b>Everday</b> Life. The authors write, [...] "Consumerism is deeply integrated into the daily life and the visual culture of the societies in which we live, often in ways that we do not even recognize" [...] (Smulyan 266). She continues, [...] "Thus even products that are sold as exemplifying tradition and heritage, such as Quaker Oats cereal, are marketed through constantly changing advertising messages" [...] (Smulyan 266). Advertising changes with the consumer in order to keep up with their target, identifying their needs and their associations of brands and products before the viewer is consciously aware. Mediums through which individuals are exposed to ads is ever changing and ever growing, as marketers are always trying to get in touch with their audience, and adapts to ways to keep attention. For example, billboards were created around the time that the automobile became prevalent in society, and they were created to provide viewers with short details about a brand or a [...] "catch phrase" [...] that a driver could spot, recognize, and remember (Smulyan 273). In the 21st century there is an extreme focus on technology and digitization of culture. Much of the advertising is done in cohesive campaigns through various mediums that make ignoring company messages nearly impossible. Aram Sinnreich writes about the relationship between online advertisers and publishers and how it has been strengthen by the digitization of media, as consumer's data is always being collected through their online activity (Sinnreich 3). In this way, consumers are targeted based on their searches and bombarded with information about more goods and services that they may eventually need, positioning themselves as a need rather than a want.|$|E
