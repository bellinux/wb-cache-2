60|$|Mr. Crewe, {{though of}} great discernment, was only mortal, {{and while he}} was {{fighting}} his battle single-handed, how was he to know that the gods above him were taking sides and preparing for conflict? The gods do not give out their <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> war for <b>publication</b> to the Associated Press; and old Tom Gaylord, who may be likened to Mars, had no intention of sending Jupiter notice until he got his cohorts into line. The strife, because it was to be internecine, was the more terrible. Hitherto the Gaylord Lumber Company, like the Winona Manufacturing Company of Newcastle (the mills of which extended for miles along the Tyne), had been a faithful ally of the Empire; and, on occasions when it was needed, had borrowed the Imperial army to obtain grants, extensions, and franchises.|$|R

5000|$|More {{documentation}} of the Russian reception <b>of</b> the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Independence comes from the accounts of Pavel Petrovich Svinyin, {{a representative of the}} tsarist government to the United States.

[...] Despite the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> Svinyin's observations of American life, the full text <b>of</b> the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Independence was outlawed in the Russian Empire until the reign and reform era of Tsar Alexander II.
