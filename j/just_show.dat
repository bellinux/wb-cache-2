It showed the story of three working women facing troubles everyday, {{both inside and outside}} their houses and how they overcome them. Dealing with issues like eve teasing and public molestation, the video got four lakh hits in two days. Speaking about the purpose of the project, Kashyap showed his intention to make people feel angry: [...] "..the idea was not to offer a solution, <b>just</b> <b>show</b> something to create that feeling".|$|E

Anissa S.

Often referred to simply as [...] "Stebbins", the book has educated and inspired generations of naturalists and herpetologists. On {{the impact of the}} guide, professor Samuel Sweet of UC Santa Barbara stated [...] "Before that book, if people went out to look for snakes, it was so they could gather them up to sell to pet shops or <b>just</b> <b>show</b> off to their buddies. What [...] did was help make a transition to a similar situation as bird watching, where it became OK to just look at the animals and leave them alone." ...|$|E

500|$|The lyrical {{content of}} Anodyne was {{influenced}} by 1950s and 1960s country music, particularly Ernest Tubb, Buck Owens, and Lefty Frizzell. Tweedy included several songs referencing aspects of the music industry. One example was [...] "Acuff-Rose", a paean on the music publishers of Acuff-Rose Music. He also wrote [...] "We've Been Had", which was intended to chastise bands such as Nirvana and The Clash who were [...] "all <b>just</b> <b>show</b> biz" [...] in his opinion. Tweedy was {{also the author of}} [...] "New Madrid", a song about Iben Browning's erroneous prediction of an apocalyptic earthquake in New Madrid, Missouri. Farrar was less comfortable discussing the lyrics that he wrote, claiming that his songs frequently change their meanings. Like other Uncle Tupelo albums, Farrar and Tweedy wrote their own lyrics, and played them for each other a week before the recording sessions. In comparison {{to the rest of the}} Uncle Tupelo catalog, Coomer described the music of the album as [...] "some of [...] earlier crunch with the acoustic subtlety of March 16–20, 1992".|$|E

500|$|Transformers: The Ride was {{primarily}} developed by Universal Creative, {{the research and}} development division of Universal Parks & Resorts. Universal Creative's Thierry Coup was the Creative Director of the ride, having worked on previous Universal attractions including Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man, and Shrek 4-D. Michael Bay, director of the Transformers film franchise, collaborated with Universal Creative on the ride, despite an earlier blog post that suggested otherwise: [...] "I don't support it yet – I'm not involved and [...] not sure the story of the ride works, and I know Optimus is not going to <b>just</b> <b>show</b> up to be directed by some new people that have never worked with him," [...] he wrote. Bay's involvement in the attraction's development was revealed by Mark Woodbury, president of Universal Creative, in an NBC documentary on Islands of Adventure's Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Industrial Light & Magic developed the special effects for the ride, having previously worked on Transformers, [...] and [...] Each installation is reported to have cost US$100 million.|$|E
500|$|... "Blah Blah Blah" [...] is a midtempo electropop song; {{the song}} {{utilizes}} synthesizers and drum machines in its production. According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing, the single {{is set in}} compound time with a moderate beat rate of 120 beats per minute. It is written in the key of D minor and Kesha's vocal range in the song spans from the note of D3 to the note of D5. Lyrically, [...] "Blah Blah Blah" [...] depicts a woman who would rather have sex than listen to a man speak as the singer finds talkative men annoying; blatant come-ons such as [...] "show me where your dick's at" [...] and [...] "I wanna be naked" [...] leave this literal meaning unambiguous. Kesha herself has been frank about this straightforward interpretation of the lyrics. The lyrics have been interpreted as {{a shot at the}} way men objectify women by speaking about them the way that they do in the music industry. [...] " [...] Andrew Burgess of MusicOMH felt that the line [...] "I don't really care where you live at, just turn around boy, let me hit that. Don't be a little bitch with your chit-chat; <b>just</b> <b>show</b> me where your dick's at" [...] was a way of belittling her male peers. Fraser McAlpine of BBC noted that it was cultural progress that a woman can now [...] "sing a song as dirty [...] as her male peers".|$|E

There is also a more complicated Byzantine gesture that attempts to represent the Greek letter chi, Christ's initial, which looks like a Latin letter [...] "X". This is formed by crossing the thumb and little finger inside the palm, with only the forefinger and next one extended, or a variant of this.|$|E

2500|$|The {{appropriate}} [...] "reference" [...] {{depends on}} the measurement and its goal. The simplest reference measurement is to simply remove the sample (replacing it by air). However, sometimes a different reference is more useful. For example, if the sample is a dilute solute dissolved in water in a beaker, then a good reference measurement might be to measure pure water in the same beaker. Then the reference measurement would cancel out not only all the instrumental properties (like what light source is used), but also the light-absorbing and light-reflecting properties {{of the water and}} beaker, and the final result would <b>just</b> <b>show</b> the properties of the solute (at least approximately).|$|E
2500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film a [...] "C". Randy Cordova of The Arizona Republic {{gave it a}} {{negative}} review saying, [...] "Saw III is devoid of any suspense or terror or common sense. It's simply an exercise in gore. And really, if that's all the filmmakers have up their sleeve, why bother with a plot? <b>Just</b> <b>show</b> one grisly makeup effect after another and you'd create the same sensory experience". Empires Kim Newman gave the film two out of five stars. He said the acting was [...] "surprisingly good" [...] but criticized the script and torture devices, calling it [...] "more contrived, and thus less effective". He ended his review saying, [...] "It requires a {{stretch of the imagination}} too far, but there's still plenty of gore and tricksy murders here".|$|E
2500|$|Almost one century {{passed before}} any {{important}} new information were published. In 1881 Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach described Scuticaria dogsonii, originated from Guyana, but in 1892, Berthold Stein, {{considering that the}} only difference it shows from Scuticaria hadwenii is the fact it bears two flowers each inflorescence, reduced it {{to a variety of}} the later.: Scuticaria hadwenii var. dogsonii in Orchideenbuch, 1892. In 1903, Célestin Alfred Cogniaux, when revising all orchids species from Brazil, cites two other varieties of Scuticaria hadwenii which, because <b>just</b> <b>show</b> color differences, can not be accepted as such today.: Scuticaria in Flora Brasiliensis Vol.3 Part.6: [...] pp. 78-81. K.F.P. von Martius Ed., 1903.

2500|$|After making Prehistory of the Partisans, {{which showed}} student {{radicals}} at Kyoto University {{from inside the}} barricades, for Ogawa Productions, Tsuchimoto began his most famous work, a series of documentaries about the mercury poisoning incident in Minamata, Japan. Disturbed that an earlier effort to film Minamata disease for a television documentary had met with resistance from those afflicted, apparently due to suspicions about the media, Tsuchimoto this time dedicated himself to working with the victims. In the first, and most famous film in the series, [...] (1971), he let the victims speak for themselves, giving {{their side of the}} story, which was not being represented in the mass media or recognized by Chisso, the polluter, and the government. He did not <b>just</b> <b>show</b> their plight to others, but worked to show his films in the area to educate other victims. According to the critic Chris Fujiwara, [...] "Tsuchimoto’s cinema embodies a search for a point of view capable of representing {{the point of view of}} his subjects, and an immersion of the filmmaker’s subjectivity in the contradictions of his material." ...|$|E
2500|$|Things {{would improve}} slowly. Banter between O'Brien and Richter improved, and {{sketches}} grew in popularity ("If They Mated", [...] "Desk Drive", [...] "In the Year 2000"). A reliable staple involved a TV screen, lowered behind O'Brien's desk and displaying a still photo of news figure. The lips and voice of these characters – frequently a party-crazed hillbilly interpretation of Bill Clinton – were supplied by writing partner Robert Smigel. A turning point was David Letterman's February 1994 appearance. [...] "It was a morale boost," [...] said O'Brien. [...] "I'm thinking, If {{the guy who}} created the 12:30 thing comes on and says we're smart and funny, let's go." [...] The show went through a temporary wobble in January 1995 when Robert Smigel, feeling burned out, quit as head writer. The show's quality improved slowly over time, and most credit O'Brien's growing comedic performance. Within a year, a comedic formula began to arise: the show would combine the lewd and wacky with a more elegant, narrative-driven remotes. Regular characters would typically include a [...] "Masturbating Bear" [...] and a famous remote found Conan visit a historic, Civil War-era baseball league. That piece was one of O'Brien's personal favorites, later remarking, [...] "When I leave this earth, at the funeral, <b>just</b> <b>show</b> this, because this pretty much says who I'm all about." ...|$|E
