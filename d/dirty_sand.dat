40|$|The {{sand control}} by {{consolidation}} involves {{the process of}} injecting chemicals into the naturally unconsolidated formation to provide an in situ grain-to-grain cementation. The sand consolidation chemicals are available for some 30 years. Several types of consolidating material were tried. Presently available systems utilize solidified plastics to provide the cementation. These systems include phenol resin, phenol-formaldehyde, epoxy, furan and phenolic-furfuryl. The sand consolidation with the steam injection is a novel technique.

(The compressor is {{on the surface and}} no mechanical parts are needed in the well). However airlift wells must be much deeper than the water table to allow for submergence.Air is generally pumped at least as deep under the water as the water is to be lifted.

40|$|Geostatistical {{variogram}} and inversion techniques {{combined with}} modern visualization tools {{have made it}} possible to re-model one-dimensional electrical resistivity data into two-dimensional (2 D) models of the near subsurface. The resultant models are capable of extending the original interpretation of the data to depict alluvium layers as individual lithological units within the 2 D space. By tuning the variogram parameters used in this approach, it is then possible to visualize individual lithofacies and geomorphological features for these lithologic units. The study re-examines an electrical resistivity dataset collected as part of a groundwater study in an area of the Bannu basin in Pakistan. Additional lithological logs from boreholes throughout the area have been combined with the existing resistivity data for calibration. Tectonic activity during the Himalayan orogeny uplifted and generated significant faulting in the rocks resulting in the formation of a depression which subsequently has been filled with clay-silt and <b>dirty</b> <b>sand</b> facies typical of lacustrine and flood plain environments. Streams arising from adjacent mountains have reworked these facies which have been eroded and replaced by gravel-sand facies along channels. It is concluded that the sediments have been deposited as prograding fan shaped bodies, flood plain, and lacustrine deposits. Clay-silt facies mark the locations of paleo depressions or lake environments, which have changed position over time due to local tectonic activity and sedimentation. The Lakki plain alluvial system has thus formed as a result of local tectonic activity with fluvial erosion and deposition characterized by coarse sediments with high electrical resistivities near the mountain ranges and fine sediments with medium to low electrical resistivities towards the basin center. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland...|$|E
40|$|Clay lumps on the {{aggregate}} levels {{is one of}} the factors that may cause disruption of the binding process and hardening of concrete. Clay lump can not blend with cement so that blocking a merger between the cement with aggregates which eventually led to the compressive strength of concrete will be reduced in the absence of binding to each other. SK SNI S- 04 - 1989 -F, the allowable levels of clay lump maximum of 5 % to fine aggregate (sand) and maximum of 1 % for coarse aggregate (split). In this study to determine the effect of the clay lump on the fine aggregate content on compressive strength of concrete on five (5) variations levels of the category of clean clay lump with content of 1 % and 2 %, medium clay lump 4 % and <b>dirty</b> <b>sand</b> with levels 7 % and 11 %, whereas for the coarse aggregate clay lump content was 0. 7 %. From the results of a study of 90 cylindrical specimens showed that the small amount of clay lump, the higher the compressive strength of concrete. Concrete compressive strength test results on average with dirty clay lump content was 31. 30 MPa, compressive strength for the concrete medium with clay lump levels were at 33. 92 MPa and compressive strength for the concrete clean of clay lump 36. 68 MPa. Compared to the dirty clay lump an increase in the levels of average compressive strength for moderate levels of 8, 37 % and the clean sand of 17, 19 %. Besides affecting in compressive strength, clay lump levels also affect the weight of concrete, and concrete density. The greater the level of clay lump, weight of concrete and concrete density will be lower.

40|$|Today, Providing {{drinking}} water and process water {{is one of the}} major problems in most countries; the surface water often need to be treated to achieve necessary quality, and in this way, technological and also financial difficulties cause great restrictions in operating the treatment units. Although water supply by simple and cheap systems has been one of the important objectives in most scientific and research centers in the world, still a great percent of population in developing countries, especially in rural areas, don't benefit well quality water. One of the big and available sources for providing acceptable water is sea water. There are two ways to treat sea water first evaporation and second reverse osmosis system. Nowadays R. O system has been used for desalination because of low budget price and easily to operate and maintenance. The sea water should be pretreated before R. O plants, because there is some difficulties in raw sea water that can decrease yield point of membranes in R. O system. The subject of this research may be useful in this way, and we hope to be able to achieve complete success in design and construction of useful pretreatment systems for R. O plant. One of the most important units in the sea water pretreatment plant is filtration, the conventional method for filtration is pressurized sand filters, and the subject of this research is about new filtration which is called continuous back wash sand filtration (CBWSF). The CBWSF designed and tested in this research may be used more economically with less difficulty. It consists two main parts first shell body and second central part comprising of airlift pump, raw water feeding pipe, air supply hose, backwash chamber and sand washer as well as inlet and outlet connections. The CBWSF is a continuously operating filter, i. e. the filter does not have to be taken out of operation for backwashing or cleaning. Inlet water is fed through the sand bed while the sand bed is moving downwards. The water gets filtered while the sand becomes dirty. Simultaneously, the <b>dirty</b> <b>sand</b> is cleaned in the sand washer and the suspended solids are discharged in backwash water. We analyze the behavior of CBWSF in pretreatment of sea water instead of pressurized sand filter. There is one important factor which is not suitable for R. O membranes, it is bio-fouling. This factor is defined by Silt Density Index (SDI). measured by SDI. In this research has been focused on decreasing of SDI and NTU. Based on this goal, the prototype of pretreatment had been designed and manufactured to test. The system design was done mainly by using the design fundamentals of CBWSF. The automatic backwash sand filter can be used in small and also big water supply schemes. In big water treatment plants, the units of filters perform the filtration and backwash stages separately, and in small treatment plants, the unit is usually compacted to achieve less energy consumption. The analysis of the system showed that it may be used feasibly for water treating, especially for limited population. The construction is rapid, simple and economic, and its performance is high enough because no mobile mechanical part is used in it, so it may be proposed as an effective method to improve the water quality and consequently the hygiene level in the remote places of the country...|$|E
40|$|Reservoir {{characterization}} {{and recognition}} of the main factors controlling the reservoir quality has a significant share in presenting a real picture of the reservoir properties. In this study, by examining a set of reservoir well log data and their clustering based on mathematical and statistical principles, reservoir electrofacies are identified for the Willespie Formation in five wells from the Whicher Range Field in Western Australia. These internally homogenous and externally heterogeneous clusters are truly a reflection of geological (sedimentary and diagenetic) and petrophysical properties of the reservoir. In this study, reservoir electrofacies (EF) were determined using clustering of well logs and core data in two individual sedimentary and petrophysical approaches. In the sedimentary approach, three EFs were identified that coincide with clean <b>sands,</b> <b>dirty</b> <b>sands</b> and shaly intervals. They are mostly related to the sedimentary texture and lithological properties indicating high reservoir heterogeneity. In the second approach, four EFs were determined {{in relation to the}} petrophysical properties of sandy packages within the reservoir. In addition, in order to find a good connection between EFs and production zones within sandy packages, five hydraulic flow units (HFUs) were introduced. The results show that low quality HFUs (i. e. A, B and to some extent C) in all petrophysical electrofacies are mainly related to the fine grained facies deposited in low energy systems. In contrast, high quality HFUs (i. e. D and E) are related to the medium to coarse and very coarse grained facies, showing different petrophysical properties, although they have generally low permeability and they are considered as tight sands. Thus, three sand types, depending on the severity of diagenetic effects, known as type 1 or very tight sands, type 2 or tight sands and type 3 or sub-tight sands were differentiated. In comparison, sandstones in type 3 with higher porosity and permeability have the best reservoir quality, whereas low reservoir quality sandstones in type 1, have been strongly affected by diagenetic effects (quartz and clay cementation). The results indicate a good agreement between core derived rock types and log facies. Using the methodology described in this study, it is possible to track reservoir flow units from well log responses...|$|R
40|$|Pitched battles are {{a regular}} {{occurrence}} in northern Alberta, Canada, as {{development of the}} province’s oil sands continues to expand. One ongoing battle—with another salvo launched in February 2011 with the leak of a European Commission report 1 —concerns how <b>dirty</b> oil <b>sands</b> are, relative to other fuels. Another concerns {{the influence of the}} oil sands industry in monitoring its own activity. 2 In an effort to cut through the rhetoric of health advocates, industry representatives, environmentalists, government officials, and local residents, the Royal Society of Canada (RSC) selected and covered expenses for an expert panel to winnow out the facts. In a report issued 15 December 20103 the panel cited substantial evidence that efforts to extract oil from the Alberta deposits have degraded air, land, and water quality to varying degrees. The extent of the degradation is sometimes controversial; water quality data, in particular, are subject to differing interpretations and attributions of causality. However, the panel says that, based on publicly available evidence, there appear to be no significant human health threats to the general population either now or from development anticipated in the next decade or so. But the panel also warns that their conclusions come with a major caveat: there are major gaps in health and environmental data, risk assessments, government oversight, information transparency, industry efforts, and disaster preparedness. The health of the region could hinge on these gaps being addressed, particularly since, according to Travis Davies, a spokesman for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, 97 % of projected oil extraction and processing is still to come...|$|R
40|$|Abstract It {{is general}} {{believed}} that a sand filter starts its life with new, perfectly clean media, which becomes gradually clogged with each filtration cycle, eventually getting {{to a point where}} either head loss or filtrate quality starts to deteriorate. At this point the backwash cycle is initiated and, through the combined action of air and water, returns the media to its original perfectly clean state. Reality, however, dictates otherwise. Many treatment plants visited a decade or more after commissioning are found to have unacceptably <b>dirty</b> filter <b>sand</b> and backwash systems incapable of returning the filter media to a desired state of cleanliness. In some cases, these problems are common ones encountered in filtration plants but many reasons for media deterioration remain elusive, falling outside of these common problems. The South African conditions of highly eutrophic surface waters at high temperatures, however, exacerbate the problems with dirty filter media. Such conditions often lead to the formation of biofilm in the filter media, which is shown to inhibit the effective backwashing of sand and carbon filters. A systematic investigation into filter media cleanliness was therefore started in 2002, ending in 2005, at the University of Johannesburg (the then Rand Afrikaans University). This involved media from eight South African Water Treatment Plants, varying between sand and sand-anthracite combinations and raw water types from eutrophic through turbid to low-turbidity waters. Five states of cleanliness and four fractions of specific deposit were identified relating to in situ washing, column washing, cylinder inversion and acid-immersion techniques. These were measured and the results compared to acceptable limits for specific deposit, as determined in previous studies, though expressed in kg/m 3. These values were used to determine the state of the filters. In order to gain greater insight into the composition of the specific deposits stripped from the media, a four-point characterisation step was introduced for the resultant suspensions based on acid-solubility and volatility. Results showed that a reasonably effective backwash removed a median specific deposit of 0. 89 kg/m 3. Further washing in a laboratory column removed a median specific deposit of 1. 34 kg/m 3. Media subjected to a standardised cylinder inversion procedure removed a median specific deposit of 2. 41 kg/m 3. Immersion in a strong acid removed a median specific deposit of 35. 2 kg/m 3. The four-point characterisation step showed that the soluble-volatile fraction was consistently small in relation to the other fractions. The organic fraction was quite high at the RG treatment plant and the soluble- non-volatile fraction was particularly high at the BK treatment plan...|$|R
