5|$|In Mendeleev's 1871 {{periodic}} table, copper, silver, {{and gold}} are listed twice, once under <b>group</b> VIII (with the iron triad and platinum <b>group</b> metals), and once under <b>group</b> IB. <b>Group</b> IB was nonetheless parenthesised {{to note that}} it was tentative. Mendeleev's main criterion for <b>group</b> assignment was the maximum oxidation state of an element: on that basis, the <b>group</b> 11 elements could not be classified in <b>group</b> IB, due {{to the existence of}} copper(II) and gold(III) compounds being known at that time. However, eliminating <b>group</b> IB would make <b>group</b> I the only main <b>group</b> (<b>group</b> VIII was labelled a transition <b>group)</b> to lack an A–B bifurcation. Soon afterward, a majority of chemists chose to classify these elements in <b>group</b> IB and remove them from <b>group</b> VIII for the resulting symmetry: this was the predominant classification until the rise of the modern medium-long 18-column periodic table, which separated the alkali metals and <b>group</b> 11 metals.|$|E

5|$|A <b>group</b> is a {{mathematical}} structure {{consisting of a}} set of objects together with a binary operation, that is, an operation combining any two objects to a third, subject to certain requirements. A <b>group</b> in which the objects are matrices and the <b>group</b> operation is matrix multiplication is called a matrix <b>group.</b> Since in a <b>group</b> every element has to be invertible, the most general matrix groups are the groups of all invertible matrices of a given size, called the general linear groups.|$|E
5|$|Analogously, the {{alternating}} <b>group</b> is a {{subgroup of}} index 2 in the symmetric <b>group</b> on n letters. The {{elements of the}} alternating <b>group,</b> called even permutations, are the products of even numbers of transpositions. The identity map, an empty product of no transpositions, is an even permutation since zero is even; it is the identity element of the <b>group.</b>|$|E
5|$|Based on this star's {{kinematic}} properties, {{it appears}} {{to belong to a}} stellar association called the Castor Moving <b>Group.</b> However, Vega may be much older than this <b>group,</b> so the membership remains uncertain. This <b>group</b> contains about 16 stars, including Alpha Librae, Alpha Cephei, Castor, Fomalhaut and Vega. All members of the <b>group</b> are moving in nearly the same direction with similar space velocities. Membership in a moving <b>group</b> implies a common origin for these stars in an open cluster that has since become gravitationally unbound. The estimated age of this moving <b>group</b> is , and they have an average space velocity of 16.5km/s.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{reaction}} {{behaviors of}} a heterobifunctional MCT/VS reactive dyes with amino <b>groups</b> and phenol <b>groups</b> were investigated at pH 7 - 10 and temperature 50 - 90 o C {{by means of}} high performance liquid chromatography. Optimum reaction conditions for MCT/VS reactive dye and amino/phenol <b>groups</b> were obtained at 60 - 80 o C and pH 8 - 9. As amino <b>groups</b> and phenol <b>groups</b> reacted with MCT/VS reactive dye individually, amino <b>groups</b> preferred to bond with VS <b>groups</b> but phenol <b>groups</b> preferred to MCT <b>groups.</b> As amino <b>groups</b> and phenol <b>groups</b> coexisted in the MCT/VS reactive dye solution, there was a main reaction product originated from the MCT/VS reactive dye molecule bonding with phenol <b>groups</b> by its MCT <b>groups</b> and bonding with amino <b>groups</b> by VS <b>groups</b> respectively. ...|$|R
