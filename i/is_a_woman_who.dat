5|$|The Malaysian Penanggalan <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> {{obtained}} {{her beauty}} through the active use of black magic or other unnatural means, and is most commonly described in local folklore to be dark or demonic in nature. She {{is able to}} detach her fanged head which flies around in the night looking for blood, typically from pregnant women. Malaysians hung jeruju (thistles) around {{the doors and windows}} of houses, hoping the Penanggalan would not enter for fear of catching its intestines on the thorns. The Leyak is a similar being from Balinese folklore of Indonesia. A Kuntilanak or Matianak in Indonesia, or Pontianak or Langsuir in Malaysia, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> died during childbirth and became undead, seeking revenge and terrorising villages. She appeared as an attractive woman with long black hair that covered a hole {{in the back of her}} neck, with which she sucked the blood of children. Filling the hole with her hair would drive her off. Corpses had their mouths filled with glass beads, eggs under each armpit, and needles in their palms to prevent them from becoming langsuir. This description would also fit the Sundel Bolongs.|$|E

25|$|Ranevskaya's {{failure to}} address {{problems}} facing her estate and family mean that she eventually loses almost everything and her fate {{can be seen}} as a criticism of those people who are unwilling to adapt to the new Russia. Her petulant refusal to accept the truth of her past, in both life and love, is her downfall throughout the play. She ultimately runs between her life in Paris and in Russia (she arrives from Paris at the start of the play and returns there afterwards). She <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> lives in an illusion of the past (often reliving memories about her son's death, etc.). The speeches by the student Trofimov, attacking intellectuals were later seen as early manifestations of Bolshevik ideas and his lines were often censored by the Tsarist officials. Cherry trees themselves are often seen as symbols of sadness or regret at the passing away of a certain situation or of the times in general.|$|E
25|$|The Baker, his Wife, and Little Red Ridinghood {{get lost}} in the woods and find Cinderella's family and the Steward, who reveal that the castle was set upon by the Giant. The Witch arrives as well, {{bringing}} news that the Giant has destroyed the village and the Baker's house. Suddenly, thunderous footsteps are heard and the Giant appears. To the shock of all, this Giant <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> has come from the second beanstalk and is the widow of the Giant that Jack killed by chopping down the beanstalk. Her booming voice proclaims that she wants Jack's blood in revenge. To satisfy the Giantess, the group realizes they must give her someone, but are unable to decide on whom until they realize that the Narrator is still commenting on the actions from the sidelines. Everyone offers her the narrator as a sacrifice, but he convinces them how lost they would be without him. Nevertheless, the Witch throws him into the Giantess's arms and he is killed upon being dropped. Jack's mother finds the group and aggressively defends her son, angering the Giantess, and the Steward clubs Jack's mother to quiet her, inadvertently killing her. As the Giantess leaves to search for Jack, Rapunzel runs into her path and is trampled, to the horror of the Witch and her Prince ("Witch's Lament").|$|E

500|$|Mariam is {{an ethnic}} Pashtun born in Herat, 1959 to a Pashtun father. She {{is the child}} of Jalil and Nana born out of the wedlock. She suffers shame {{throughout}} her childhood because of the circumstances of her birth. Khaled Hosseini described her portrayal: [...] "The key word with Mariam {{is that she is}} isolated {{in every sense of the}} word. She <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> is detached from the day-to-day norms of human existence. Really, she just wants connection with another human being." [...] Despite initially resenting Laila, she becomes a [...] "friend and a doting alternative mother" [...] to her through the [...] "common hardship" [...] of being married to the [...] "abusive, psychologically imposing" [...] Rasheed.|$|E
500|$|... "Mariana" [...] is {{a poem by}} Alfred, Lord Tennyson, {{published}} in 1830. The poem follows a common theme in much of Tennyson's work—that of despondent isolation. The subject of [...] "Mariana" [...] <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> continuously laments her lack of connection with society. The isolation defines her existence, and her longing for a connection leaves her wishing for death {{at the end of}} every stanza. The premise of [...] "Mariana" [...] originates in William Shakespeare's Measure for Measure, but the poem ends before Mariana's lover returns. Tennyson's version was adapted by others, including John Everett Millais and Elizabeth Gaskell, for use in their own works. The poem was well received by critics, and it is described by critics as an example of Tennyson's skill at poetry.|$|E
500|$|Samuel R. Delany {{was one of}} {{the first}} openly gay science fiction authors; in his {{earliest}} stories the gay sexual aspect appears as a [...] "sensibility", rather than in overt sexual references. In some stories, such as Babel-17 (1966), same-sex love and same-sex intercourse are clearly implied but are given a kind of protective colouration because the protagonist <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> is involved in a three-person marriage with two men. The affection all three characters share for each other is in the forefront, and sexual activity between or among them is not directly described. In Dhalgren (1975), his most famous science fiction novel, Delany peoples his large canvas with characters of a wide variety of sexualities. Once again, sexual activity is not the focus of the novel although there are some of the first explicitly described scenes of gay sex in SF and Delany depicts characters with a wide variety of motivations and behaviours.|$|E

The reviewer also said that [...] " [...] her chart success, Lady Gaga has proven herself to be an of-the-moment pop sensation. Dig deeper, and it's clear she's versatile and talented enough to have staying power." [...] Mikel Wood from Rolling Stone also gave a positive review saying [...] "The tongue-in-cheek tabloid-victim shtick that provides some laughs on The Fame grew somewhat tiresome at the Wiltern, especially when the singer started spewing half-baked media-studies nonsense like, 'Some say Lady Gaga is a lie'... Fortunately, this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> knows how to lighten a mood: Within 10 minutes or so, she'd donned a flesh-colored leotard and a bedazzled admiral's cap and was rhyming 'boys in cars' with 'buy us drinks in bars." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite her largely demure {{public persona}} as a {{traditional}} wife and homemaker, Nixon was not as self-effacing and timid as her critics often claimed. When a news photographer wanted her to strike yet another pose while wearing an apron, she firmly responded, [...] "I think we've had enough of this kitchen thing, don't you?" [...] Some journalists, such as columnist and White House Correspondent Robert Thompson felt that Pat was an ideal balance for the 1970s; Thompson wrote that she proved that [...] "women can {{play a vital role}} in world affairs" [...] while still retaining a [...] "feminine manner." [...] Other journalists felt that Pat represented the failings of the feminine mystique, and portrayed her as being out of step with her times. Those who opposed the Vietnam War identified her with the Nixon administration's policies, and, as a result, occasionally picketed her speaking events. After she had spoken to some of them, though, one student told the press that [...] "she wanted to listen. I felt like this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> really cares about what we are doing. I was surprised." [...] Veteran CBS correspondent Mike Wallace expressed regret that the one major interview he was never able to conduct was that of Pat Nixon.|$|E
