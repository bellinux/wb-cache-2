5|$|Development for {{multiple}} platforms is profitable, but difficult. Optimizations needed for one platform architecture {{do not necessarily}} translate to others. Individual platforms such as the Sega Genesis and PlayStation 3 are seen as difficult to develop for compared to their competitors, and developers are not yet fully accustomed to new technologies such as multi-core processors and hyper-threading. Multi-platform releases are increasingly common, but not all differences between editions on multiple platforms can be fully explained by hardware alone, and there remain franchise stalwarts that exist solely on one system. Developers for new platforms such as handheld and mobile systems do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> {{under the pressure of}} $20 million budgets and the scrutiny of publishers' marketing experts.|$|E
5|$|The sister {{trains in}} service with NSB were prone to {{technical}} failures, since they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> on hundred-year-old infrastructure on cross-mountain services. The Class 71 has more lenient operating conditions thanks to better infrastructure, and therefore {{has not been}} prone to as much malfunction. The only incident to ground all the Class 71 trains occurred on 17 June 2000, after a Class 73-train operated by NSB derailed at Nelaug Station owing to stress on the axles. The Oslo Airport Express Trains were back in service the next day, while the 73-series had to wait another month before returning to service. On 24 January 2004, a Class 71 unit {{had to be taken}} out of service due to smoke from a stressed bearing, causing the replacement of the bearings on all units within days.|$|E
25|$|The need {{to control}} and measure all the sources of {{systematic}} errors required a rigorous and integrated design. COBE would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> {{for a minimum of}} 6 months, and constrain the amount of radio interference from the ground, COBE and other satellites as well as radiative interference from the Earth, Sun and Moon. The instruments required temperature stability and to maintain gain, and a high level of cleanliness to reduce entry of stray light and thermal emission from particulates.|$|E

25|$|The {{rolling stock}} on the Berlin U-Bahn are {{split into two}} categories: Kleinprofil ("small profile", used by the U1, U2, U3 and U4) and Großprofil ("large profile", used by the U5, U6, U7, U8 and U9) lines. The names refer {{to the size of}} the train's coaches. Großprofil coaches have a width of 2.65 metres and a height of 3.40 metres, and Kleinprofil coaches are only 2.30 metres wide and 3.10 metres high. Therefore, the trains <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> on {{separate}} networks.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary Tongans {{often have}} {{strong ties to}} {{overseas}} lands. They may have been migrant workers in New Zealand, or have lived and traveled in New Zealand, Australia, or the United States. Many Tongans now live overseas, in a Tongan diaspora, and send home remittances to family members (often aged) who prefer to remain in Tonga. Tongans themselves often <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> in two different contexts, which they often call anga fakatonga, the traditional Tongan way, and anga fakapālangi, the Western way. A culturally adept Tongan learns both sets of rules and when to switch between them.|$|E
25|$|The {{operation}} of these markets has also declined. In Mexico City, about 65% of permits that merchants <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> in these public markets {{have some sort}} of irregularity. None of these markets have adequate sanitary measures for meat. Meat and dairy products sold in tianguis and fixed markets are not regulated or inspected according to the Centro Universitario de Ciencias Exactas e Ingenierías (CUCEI). Contaminants such as Salmonella and E. coli have been detected in products tested by this organization. Since 1997, Mexico City authorities have not carried out inspection in businesses selling groceries of any type in the city. Federal authorities only have jurisdiction in the states.|$|E

25|$|An {{integrated}} system has several technical advantages {{in comparison to}} towed barges. Traditionally tugs, being short in length, <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> at relatively high Froude numbers resulting in high wave making resistance and the barges, being towed in the tugs' wake, have skegs that improve directional stability but increase drag. Positioning the tug behind the barge in a stern notch improves the hydrodynamic efficiency of the combination, resulting in significant reductions in the total resistance. In addition the tug, operating {{in the wake of}} the barge, has better control over the combination and thus improves seaworthiness and maneuverability in comparison to the traditional towing arrangement.|$|E
25|$|Joint Combined Exchange Training or JCET {{programs}} are exercises {{designed to provide}} training opportunities for American Special Forces by holding the training exercises in countries that the forces may one day <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> in, {{as well as providing}} training opportunities for the armed forces of the host countries. Typically, each JCET program involved 10–40 American special forces personnel, though can sometimes involved up to 100. The United States Congress permitted the use of funds from the military budget to be used in overseas training such as JCETs in 1991, providing that the Secretary of Defense submits to Congress annually a report on overseas training activities.|$|E
25|$|Pook's {{design was}} {{constrained}} by the requirement that the vessel be armored. It would also <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> on the shallow waters of the interior. Together, these meant that the hull {{had to be made}} quite broad, in order to support the weight of the armor. Faced with the limitations of the technology of the day, Pook decided that the hull should be built with three keels, the outboard pair somewhat longer than the one on the centerline. Propulsion would be provided by a single paddlewheel, immediately aft of the center keel; perhaps unintentionally, this meant that it would be somewhat protected from enemy projectiles by the armor carried along the sides.|$|E

25|$|Charter {{schools are}} state funded schools which operate {{outside of the}} normal state system. They began in 2014 with 5 small schools. Charter schools do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> with any {{registered}} or trained teachers. Teachers {{do not have to}} have current practicing certificates. They do not have to have a principal. They are allowed to benefit from profit making. They do not have to follow the national curriculum. They receive approximately 3 times the level of funding per student than normal state schools. If the charter school roll drops during the year, the school keeps the extra funding, unlike normal state schools, where funding is matched to students actually attending. If a charter school fails the management/owners are allowed to keep the land and buildings and other capital assets. Charter schools have less compliance with regulations than State schools although teachers must undergo police vetting.|$|E
25|$|The depot was {{originally}} {{planned to be}} situated at Haslum, but a more suitable lot was found at Avløs. A subdivision with dwellings for 39 employee families was also built there. On 27 August, the ground around Bekkestua started to sink; the track was lifted and covered with stone. Two days later, the track had sunk {{into the ground and}} a small island was created in a nearby lake. It turned out that the area was resting on clay that had transformed to quick clay after a water pipe had broken. It took two weeks to repair the damage. It became clear in 1924 that Bærumsbanen would also <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> city services along the Skøyen Line in Oslo. This caused the company to order three trams and trailers, this time from Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk. At the time it cost NOK 0.15 to take the tram within the city limits of Oslo, and NOK 1 from the city to Bekkestua. Passengers carried out a strike in 1924; this resulted is slightly cheaper tickets, {{but at the same time}} the trams and stations were equipped with advertisements.|$|E
500|$|Through late 1964 Bell was {{considering}} {{the role of}} an X-ray-armed Zeus missile in the Nike-X system. A January 1965 report outlines this possibility, noting that it would have to have a much larger warhead dedicated to the production of X-rays, and would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> at higher altitudes to maximize the effect. A major advantage was that accuracy needs were much reduced, from a minimum of about [...] for the original Zeus' neutron-based attack, to {{something on the order of}} a few miles. This meant that the range limits of the original Zeus, which were defined by the accuracy of the radars to about , were greatly eased. This, in turn, meant that a less sophisticated radar could be used, one with accuracy on the order of a mile rather than feet, which could be built much less expensively using VHF parts.|$|E
25|$|One major {{criterion}} for optimizers {{is just the}} number of required function evaluations as this often is already a large computational effort, usually much more effort than within the optimizer itself, which mainly <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> over the N variables.|$|R

2500|$|With the {{introduction}} of the marine propeller back in the early 19th century, cavitation during operation has always been a limiting factor on efficiency of ships. Cavitation in marine propellers develops when the propeller operates at a high speed. To combat cavitation, ships <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> at a lower speed than maximum that their engines could produce, increasing operating costs and lowering efficiency. Ever since {{the introduction}} of the propeller, solutions for cavitation had developed and tested.|$|E
2500|$|Alistair Carmichael, the Secretary of State for Scotland, said in January 2014 that {{it would}} make sense for Scotland to be in the CTA, but it would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> similar {{immigration}} policies {{to the rest of the}} UK. This position was supported by Home Secretary Theresa May, who said in March 2014 that passport checks should be introduced if Scotland adopted a looser immigration policy. The Conservative MP Richard Bacon said there would be [...] "no reason" [...] for border controls to be implemented.|$|E
2500|$|In 1972, {{capacity}} restraints {{forced the}} authorities to move all charter traffic from Fornebu to Gardermoen. However, SAS and Braathens SAFE were allowed to keep their charter services from Fornebu, so they would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> from two bases. A former hangar was converted to a terminal building and in 1974 passenger numbers were at 269,000 per year. In 1978, SAS started a weekly flight to New York. In 1983, further restrictions were enforced, and also SAS and Braathens SAFE had to move their charter operations to Gardermoen, increasing passenger numbers that year to 750,000. Several expansions of runway were made after the war, and by the 1985-extension the north-south runway was [...]|$|E

2500|$|The New South Wales {{government}} {{created a}} taskforce {{to look into}} regulating Uber, stating that the existing regulatory framework is [...] "difficult to enforce", and therefore not as effective as it could be. The taskforce also noted that ride sharing services [...] "appear to meet the criteria of a public passenger service" [...] under the 1990 Act and drivers are therefore required to pay local government services tax GST. This is despite the fact Uber claims {{that it is not}} a taxi service and should not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> under taxi regulation. In Brisbane, Australia, the legal status of Uber's service has been challenged by governments and taxi companies, which allege that its use of drivers who are not licensed to drive taxicabs is unsafe and illegal.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{nuclear power}} plants are {{fundamentally}} heat engines, waste heat disposal becomes an issue at high ambient temperature. [...] Droughts and extended periods of high temperature can [...] "cripple nuclear power generation, and it is often during these times when electricity demand is highest because of air-conditioning and refrigeration loads and diminished hydroelectric capacity". In such very hot weather a power reactor may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> at a reduced power level or even shut down. [...] In 2009 in Germany, eight nuclear reactors had {{to be shut down}} simultaneously on hot summer days for reasons relating to the overheating of equipment or of rivers. Overheated discharge water has resulted in significant fish kills in the past, harming livelihood and raising public concern.|$|E
2500|$|Despite these difficulties, fMRI {{has been}} used {{clinically}} to map functional areas, check left-right hemispherical asymmetry in language and memory regions, check the neural correlates of a seizure, study how the brain recovers partially from a stroke, test how well a drug or behavioral therapy works, detect the onset of Alzheimer's, and note the presence of disorders like depression. Mapping of functional areas and understanding lateralization of language and memory help surgeons avoid removing critical brain regions when they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> and remove brain tissue. [...] This is of particular importance in removing tumors and in patients who have intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. Lesioning tumors requires pre-surgical planning to ensure no functionally useful tissue is removed needlessly. Recovered depressed patients have shown altered fMRI activity in the cerebellum, and this may indicate a tendency to relapse. Pharmacological fMRI, assaying brain activity after drugs are administered, {{can be used to}} check how much a drug penetrates the blood–brain barrier and dose vs effect information of the medication.|$|E
