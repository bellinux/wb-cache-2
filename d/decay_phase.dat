40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impacts of the {{transition}} of El Niño <b>decaying</b> <b>phases</b> on the western North Pacific anticyclone (WNPAC) anomalies in the subsequent summer with a coupled GCM. The modeling {{results suggest that the}} El Niños with short <b>decaying</b> <b>phases</b> lead to significant WNPAC anomalies in the following summer, which are contributed to mainly by the El Niños followed by La Niñas, in comparison with those not followed by La Niñas. In contrast, the long decaying cases are associated with the disappearance of WNPAC anomalies in the summer. These differences in the WNP circulation anomalies {{can be explained by the}} different configurations of simultaneous SSTs in the Indian Ocean and in the central and eastern tropical Pacific: positive SSTs in the former region and negative ones in the latter region constructively induce significant WNPAC anomalies for the short decaying cases, while the roles of positive SSTs in both regions for the long decaying cases work destructively and lead to weak WNP circulation anomalies. Further analysis indicates that the different lengths of El Niño <b>decaying</b> <b>phases</b> are predicted by the strength of Indian Ocean SSTs in the mature winter. The warmer wintertime Indian Ocean SSTs favor the anomalous easterly wind over the western and central equatorial Pacific in the subsequent summer, leading to a short decaying of El Niño. Thus, the strength of wintertime Indian Ocean SSTs is one of the important factors that affect the length of El Niño <b>decaying</b> <b>phase</b> and resultant WNPAC anomalies in the following summer...|$|R

40|$|Previous studies {{documented}} that a distinct southward shift of central-Pacific low-level wind anomalies occurring during the ENSO <b>decaying</b> <b>phase,</b> {{is caused by}} an interaction between the Western Pacific annual cycle and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability. The present study finds that the meridional movement of the central-Pacific wind anomalies appears only during traditional Eastern-Pacific (or EP) El Niño events rather than in Central-Pacific (CP) El Niño events in which sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies are confined to the central Pacific. The zonal structure of ENSO-related SST anomalies therefore has an important effect on meridional asymmetry in the associated atmospheric response and its modulation by the annual cycle. In contrast to EP El Niño events, the SST anomalies of CP El Niño events extend further west towards to the warm pool region with its climatological warm SSTs. In the warm pool region, relatively small SST anomalies thus are able to excite convection anomalies {{on both sides of}} the equator, even with a meridionally asymmetric SST background state. Therefore, almost meridionally symmetric precipitation and wind anomalies are observed over the central Pacific during the <b>decaying</b> <b>phase</b> of CP El Niño events. The SST anomaly pattern of La Niña events is similar to CP El Niño events with a reversed sign. Accordingly, no distinct southward displacement of the atmospheric response occurs over the central Pacific during the La Niña <b>decaying</b> <b>phase.</b> These results have important implications for ENSO climate impacts over East Asia, since the anomalous low-level anticyclone over the western North Pacific is an integral part of the annual cycle-modulated ENSO response...|$|R

The high spectral resolution allows for a clean separation of thermal and non-thermal components in the 10 - 30 keV range, {{where most of the}} non-thermal photons are emitted. Spectral index and flux can thus be determined with much better accuracy than before. The spectral soft-hard-soft behavior in rise-peak-decay phases is discovered not only in the general flare development, but even more pronounced in subpeaks.

40|$|Spectral {{evolution}} of gamma-ray burst pulses assumed to arise from emission of fireballs is explored. It is found that, {{due to the}} curvature effect, the integrated flux and peak energy are well related by a power law in the <b>decaying</b> <b>phase</b> of pulses, where the index is about 3, being free of the intrinsic emission and the Lorentz factor. The spectrum of a pulse in its <b>decaying</b> <b>phase</b> differs slightly for different intrinsic spectral evolution patterns, indicating that it {{is dominated by the}} curvature effect. In the rising phase, the integrated flux keeps increasing whilst the peak energy remains unchanged when the intrinsic emission bears an unchanged spectrum. Within this phase, the flux decreases with the increasing of the peak energy for a hard-to-soft intrinsic spectrum, and for a soft-to-hard-to-soft intrinsic spectrum, the flux generally increases with the increasing of the peak energy. An intrinsic soft-to-hard-to-soft spectral evolution within a co-moving pulse would give rise to a pulse-like evolutionary curve for the peak energy.

40|$|The {{linearity}} of the synaptic {{summation of}} two unitary excitatory synaptic events was investigated during whole cell recordings from retinal target neurons in an eye-attached isolated brain stem preparation. Pairs of unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were evoked by bipolar stimulation electrodes that {{were directed to}} two distinct foci on the retinal surface based on the visual receptive field boundaries. The interval between stimulation of each retinal site was incremented by 0. 5 - 1 ms to quantify {{the time course of}} nonlinear summation using an exponential fit. Response facilitation was never observed; however, the coincident arrival of synaptic inputs caused a response attenuation in 26 of the 37 pairs studied. Twelve of the 26 pairs had time constants of their attenuation that were similar to the time constants of the <b>decaying</b> <b>phases</b> of the first EPSPs of each pair. This suggests that the attenuation of these 12 pairs may be entirely due to voltage-dependent mechanisms, such as a reduction in driving force or a change of the activity of voltage-sensitive channels. On the other hand, the 14 other pairs had their time constant of attenuation shorter than the time constants of the <b>decaying</b> <b>phase</b> of the first EPSP. in fact, the attenuation time constants were often closer to the time constants of the <b>decaying</b> <b>phases</b> of the first excitatory postsynaptic currents of each pair. This finding suggests that the attenuation of these 14 pairs involve a shunting mechanism due to the opening of synaptic channels. The presence of this conductance-dependent mechanism is supported by the finding of asymmetric effects on the time course of attenuation when the stimulation sequence was reversed. These results are discussed in terms of the processing by neurons of coincident excitatory inputs onto spatially distinct points of their dendritic trees. status: publishe...|$|R

We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of the spectral index and the normalization (flux) of the non-thermal component of the electron spectra observed by RHESSI during 24 solar hard X-ray flares. The quantitative evolution is confronted with the predictions of simple electron acceleration models featuring the soft-hard-soft behaviour. The comparison is general in scope and can be applied to different acceleration models, provided that they make predictions for the behavior of the spectral index {{as a function of the}} normalization. A simple stochastic acceleration model yields plausible best-fit model parameters for about 77 % of the 141 events consisting of rise and <b>decay</b> <b>phases</b> of individual hard X-ray peaks.
