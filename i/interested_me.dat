500|$|Despite the book's deficiencies, reviewers were {{practically}} unanimous in praising the realistic description and mood of Anderson's settings from Coal Creek to Chicago. Within these settings, McGregor's scheme was acknowledged by the even-tempered New York Tribune reviewer as a [...] "clever and original idea". Others, like editor Francis Hackett wrote [...] "Where Marching Men succeeds is in thrusting the greater American realities before us..." [...] to which critic George Bernard Donlin, in his Dial review, adds [...] "Mr. Anderson's book <b>interested</b> <b>me</b> chiefly as {{the expression of}} a vigorous and sincere mind...".|$|E
500|$|During {{her time}} at Oxford, she was noted for her {{isolated}} and serious attitude. At Oxford, {{she met a}} young man named Tony Bray (1926–2014) who was impressed by her and later recalled that she was [...] "very thoughtful and a very good conversationalist. That's probably what <b>interested</b> <b>me.</b> She was good at general subjects". Her enthusiasm for politics as a girl made him think of her as [...] "unusual". Bray met Roberts' parents and described her father as [...] "slightly austere" [...] and [...] "totally correct" [...] and her mother as [...] "very proper" [...] and [...] "motherly".|$|E
500|$|Tolkien {{also cited}} H. Rider Haggard's novel She in a {{telephone}} interview: [...] "I suppose as a boy She <b>interested</b> <b>me</b> as much as anything—like the Greek shard of Amyntas , which {{was the kind of}} machine by which everything got moving." [...] A supposed facsimile of this potsherd appeared in Haggard's first edition, and the ancient inscription it bore, once translated, led the English characters to She's ancient kingdom. Critics have compared this device to the Testament of Isildur in The Lord of the Rings and to Tolkien's efforts to produce as an illustration a realistic page from the Book of Mazarbul. Critics starting with Edwin Muir have found resemblances between Haggard's romances and Tolkien's.|$|E

The film was directed by Shinde, her second directorial after the comedy-drama film English Vinglish (2012). When Shinde was asked {{in an interview with}} The Indian Express, whether there is a personal story to Dear Zindagi, she replied, [...] "Dear Zindagi is inspired by life in general. It started with an idea about the connections we make in our lives and how such connections can impact us. That’s something that <b>interested</b> <b>me</b> and I tried to develop a story around the philosophy." [...] In August 2015, Shinde revealed that she had [...] "almost" [...] completed working on the screenplay.|$|E
500|$|Hastings {{was born}} on 17 March 1880 in London to Alfred Gardiner Hastings and Kate Comyns Carr, a painter and the sister of J. Comyns Carr. Having been born on Saint Patrick's Day Hastings was named after the saint. His father was a {{solicitor}} with [...] "somewhat seedy clients", and the family were repeatedly bankrupted. Despite financial difficulties, there was enough money in the family to send Hastings to a private preparatory school in 1890 and to Charterhouse School in 1894. Hastings disliked school, saying [...] "I hated the bell which drove us up in the morning, I hated the masters; above all I hated the work, which never <b>interested</b> <b>me</b> in the slightest degree". He was bullied at both the preparatory school and at Charterhouse, and did not excel at either sports or his studies.|$|E
500|$|In 2003 Bullen made {{a journey}} to Perth's Small Screen Big Picture. On the return leg, after 12 hours of seeing nothing but the Nullarbor Plain through the train window, he began {{developing}} a short subject on infidelity at television conferences. The short, entitled Amorality Tale, which marked Bullen's directorial debut, was screened at various film festivals in 2005, and was {{a finalist for the}} first Rosemount Diamond at the Jackson Hole Film Festival. On the themes of the film, Bullen said, [...] "What has always <b>interested</b> <b>me</b> is the notion of ordinary people and how they react in ordinary situations [...] what fascinated me is the way we arrive at the choices we make. The idea of this film is to say that the choices we make might not lead to the outcomes we expect." [...] He formerly expressed interest in directing an episode of Cold Feet, but decided against it on the basis that his inexperience would make him [...] "inadequate" [...] and that the job was best left to professional directors. The short was produced by Pommie Granite Productions, a company set up by Bullen after his exclusive contract with Granada ended in September 2004. At the end of 2004, he became the seventh person to rewrite the script of the DreamWorks/Aardman Animations film Tortoise vs. Hare. He made at least three drafts.|$|E

500|$|Linda Eastman was a music fan {{who once}} commented, [...] "all my teen years were spent with an {{ear to the}} radio." [...] At times, she played hookey to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry. She became a popular {{photographer}} with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, [...] "It was John who <b>interested</b> <b>me</b> at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked." [...] The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, [...] "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to... Pushiness worked for me that night!" [...] Linda said this about their meeting: [...] "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else ... and I saw Paul {{at the other side}} of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up." [...] The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, [...] "We had a lot of fun together... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment." [...] He added, [...] "We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off... miraculous that we made it. But we did." ...|$|E
2500|$|Screenwriter Alex Garland was {{inspired}} to write Sunshine based on scientific ideas about the heat death of the universe, specifically [...] "an article projecting the future of mankind from a physics-based, atheist perspective", according to Garland. The article was from an American scientific periodical, and Garland had wondered about what would result from the Sun's death. Garland said of the project: [...] "What <b>interested</b> <b>me</b> {{was the idea that}} it could get to a point when the entire planet's survival rests on the shoulders of one man, and what that would do to his head." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to her musical skills, Callas had a particular gift for language {{and the use of}} language in music.

2500|$|Melville's {{major source}} for the story was an {{advertisement}} for a new book, The Lawyer's Story, printed in both the Tribune and the Times for 18 February 1853. The book was published anonymously later that year but in fact was written by popular novelist James A. Maitland. This advertisement included the complete first chapter, which had the following opening sentence: [...] "In the summer of 1843, having an extraordinary quantity of deeds to copy, I engaged, temporarily, an extra copying clerk, who <b>interested</b> <b>me</b> considerably, in consequence of his modest, quiet, gentlemanly demeanor, and his intense application to his duties." [...] Biographer Parker points out that nothing else in the chapter besides this [...] "remarkably evocative sentence" [...] was [...] "notable". Critic Andrew Knighton notes the debt of the story to an obscure work from 1846, Robert Grant White's Law and Laziness: or, Students at Law of Leisure.
