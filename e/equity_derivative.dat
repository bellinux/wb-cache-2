50|$|Under F-IRB, EAD is {{calculated}} taking {{account of the}} underlying asset, forward valuation, facility type and commitment details. This value does not take account of guarantees, collateral or security (i.e. ignores Credit Risk Mitigation Techniques {{with the exception of}} on-balance sheet netting where the effect of netting is included in Exposure At Default). For on-balance sheet transactions, EAD is identical to the nominal amount of exposure. On-balance sheet netting of loans and deposits of a bank to a corporate counterparty is permitted to reduce the estimate of EAD under certain conditions. For off-balance sheet items, there are two broad types which the IRB approach needs to address: transactions with uncertain future drawdown, such as commitments and revolving credits, and OTC foreign exchange, interest rate and <b>equity</b> <b>derivative</b> contracts.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the pricing of the Contingent Convertible Bonds (CoCos), using the <b>Equity</b> <b>Derivative</b> {{approach}} and the Bates model to simulate the stock price with Monte Carlo algorithm. The CoCo bonds are hybrid financial instruments with loss-absorbency features, characterized by a conversion into equity or a write-down of the face value, when a specified trigger event happens, which is usually related to an accounting indicator of the bank. The <b>Equity</b> <b>Derivative</b> model prices the CoCos under the assumption of the Black-Scholes volatility, converting the accounting trigger into a market trigger. Instead, the thesis aims to underlining {{the impact of a}} more market-conform path of the stock price. Hence, the Bates model is considered more suitable in this pricing framework, allowing the stock prices to have sudden jumps and a time-varying volatility. Therefore, the comparison between the Bates and the Black-Scholes models is made within the <b>Equity</b> <b>Derivative</b> framework. The market trigger is unobservable, thus the analysis of the CoCo prices is done indirectly. Namely, matching the model prices with the observed market prices of two categories of Barclays CoCos, the levels of the implied market trigger are inferred. The higher they are, the higher trigger probabilities should be. However, while the Bates extension provides a market trigger greater than the one in the Black-Scholes case, the related trigger probabilities are lower, overturning the interpretation for which the Bates model provides a riskier valuation of the CoCos. Finally, a number of factors that impact on the model applicability are considered, showing how a complex structure of the CoCo is difficult to be captured by an implied-market approach, as the formulated extension of the <b>Equity</b> <b>Derivative</b> model.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of <b>equity</b> <b>derivatives</b> {{has proven to}} be problematic for successive regulatory frameworks. Part of the problem stems from the very fact that <b>equity</b> <b>derivatives</b> do not neatly fit into legal categories or regulatory frameworks that fail to keep pace with dynamic and innovative financial markets. It was anticipated that recent wholesale changes in Australia to the {{regulation of}} financial markets and services would overcome some of these difficulties. Despite some obvious improvements, it is argued that functional regulation has {{failed to live up to}} its mark.
