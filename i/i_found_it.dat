500|$|He {{assumed it}} was some {{software}} someone had sent him to review. He tested {{it out in a}} spare laptop, and instead found the video.

He said that he [...] "later reexamined it and started noticing the 'codes' and letters hidden all around the video".|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were negative, however. Tom Kessenich, in {{his book}} Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files gave the episode a more {{positive}} review, writing [...] "Perhaps I am alone in sensing the off-beat love story I found {{to be at the}} heart of 'Alpha'.

He stated, [...] "No one likes looking at their own passport photograph, but <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> accurate. It's not flattering, but it's the truth." ...|$|E

500|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} with NME magazine, frontman Alex Turner cited John Lennon {{as a major}} influence lyrically. When speaking about Lennon, Turner said; [...] "I remember when I first started writing songs, and writing lyrics, I {{really wanted to be}} able to write an [...] "I Am the Walrus" [...] type song, and <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> very difficult. You listen to that and it sounds like it's all nonsense, but it's difficult to write that sort of thing and make it compelling. Lennon definitely had a knack for that".|$|E

Fear so intense that I remember nothing more, only that I stumbled out of the store in possession of what I knew I must have, a book as necessary to me as air... <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> when I was eighteen years old.

They can go from first to second in 2.9 seconds; and no pitcher catcher combination in baseball could throw from here to there to tag second in 2.9 seconds, it was always 3, 3.1, 3.2. So actually, the runner that can make the continuous, regular move like Rickey's can't be thrown out, and he's proven it." ...|$|E

I made secret war upon it when I was a student and declined to accept the positions it offered me. By doing this I made myself a beggar but I retained my pride.

[...] In reference to Trini Alvarado, the other actress in their fight scene, Torv also mentioned when shooting it [...] "We had so much fun!

She has described herself as a [...] "late bloomer": [...] "All of my friends were kissing boys and drinking cider way before me. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> really depressing that we weren't making camp fires and everyone was doing grown-up stuff."

500|$|Although {{the track}} {{was a major}} hit for the band, Dave Davies did not enjoy the success of [...] "Lola", saying, [...] "In fact, when 'Lola' was a hit, {{it made me feel}} a bit uncomfortable. Because it was taking us out of a {{different}} sort of comfort zone, where we'd been getting into the work, and the writing and the musicality was more thought about. It did have that smell of: 'Oh blimey, not that again.' <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> a bit odd, that period. And then it got odder and weirder".

500|$|Ellie Kendrick, who portrays Meera Reed, {{spoke about}} {{the writing of the}} episode {{following}} its airing, and revealed that she was surprised by the scene, saying [...] "When I was reading the episode, I completely forgot that I was a character in the show. I was reading it with such excitement, because this is a real story unfolding, with so many mysteries and quantum leaps and Inception-style traveling between the past and the present. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> very exciting. So the first time I read it, I was just reading it for enjoyment, really, because it was so well-written and exciting. Once I picked my jaw up off the floor, I was really keen to get started working on it, because it's such an epic sequence." ...|$|E
500|$|Harvey {{has said}} of her time with Automatic Dlamini: [...] "I ended up not singing very much but I was just happy {{to learn how to}} play the guitar. I wrote a lot during the time I was with them but my first songs were crap. I was {{listening}} to a lot of Irish folk music at the time, so the songs were folky and full of penny whistles and stuff. It was ages before I felt ready to perform my own songs in front of other people." [...] She also credits Parish for teaching her how to perform in front of audiences, saying [...] "after the experience with John's band and seeing him perform <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> was enormously helpful to me as a performer to engage with people in the audience, and I probably did learn that from him, amongst other things." ...|$|E

She portrayed Kathy Nicolo, an abandoned wife whose inherited house is sold at auction to the Iranian emigre and former colonel Massoud Amir Behrani (Ben Kingsley). After reading the script, Connelly said: [...] "(the story is) moving and beautifully written. I liked {{the fact that there is}} no good guy and bad guy. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> really compelling that both sides do things that are morally questionable, because life is often like that." [...] Producer Michael London said about Connelly's portrayal: [...] "I think she understood Kathy and knew in her bones that she could take this character and give her the kind of dimension that she had. I don't think there is another actress who could have played Kathy with such power and grace." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of The Dark Knight, Eckhart next {{appeared}} in Alan Ball's Towelhead (2008), an adaption of the Alicia Erian novel of the same name, in which he played a Gulf War Army reservist who sexually abuses his 13-year-old Arab-American neighbor. The film was screened under the name Nothing is Private at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival. When he was first approached for the role, Eckhart revealed {{that he did not}} want to play a [...] "pedophile". When asked about the sex scenes, Eckhart said: [...] "Those were difficult times.... The way I did it was to really trust Alan. It was in the words. I really trusted Summer , and I tried to get her to trust me, to build a relationship when we were doing physical scenes. We'd really rehearse them mechanically, and I'd say, 'OK, I'm going to put my hand here, I'm going to do this.'... I think <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> more difficult." [...] Towelhead was critically and financially unsuccessful.|$|E
