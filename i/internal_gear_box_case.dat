40|$|The <b>internal</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> (IGB) of an {{aeroengine}} {{represents a}} severe challenge in {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD). In the present study, an axisymmetric CFD model was assessed to investigate the complex internal air flow in an aeroengine IGB. All the non-axisymmetric components and geometry features inside the <b>gear</b> <b>box,</b> such as bearings, gears, bolts and slots, {{as well as the}} radial drive system and vent pipes, were simulated using porous media models. Their flow resistance was estimated either by empirical correlations or by preparatory CFD studies and comparison with measurements. To evaluate the CFD technique adopted in the present investigation, a separate bolt windage study was conducted using a similar axisymmtric CFD model with the porous media approach. Good agreement of the bolt windage with other workers' rig test data was observed. The present application of the porous media approach into a complex <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> flow represents a first attempt to use state of art CFD to assist an industrial design. Both maximum take-off (MTO) and ground idle (GI) running conditions were investigated. The complex flow patterns in the <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> were obtained. The results show a similar dimensionless performance of intermediate pressure (IP) and high pressure (HP) gears between the two operating conditions. For the present <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> arrangement under investigation, the CFD results suggest that the airflows induced by the HP gear and HP bearing are higher than their IP counterparts. A comparison with power absorption rig test data for the similar HP crownwheel in isolation shows that an assumption of pressure loss coefficient of 10 for the porous media of bevel gears may be appropriate, as the HP gear torque coefficient obtained in the CFD prediction is equal to 0. 05, very close to its expected value. In addition, the effects of an assumed stationary IP gear and a large seal clearance on the HP gear performance were also investigated. The numerical results show that their impacts are insignificant, probably due to the strong pumping effects of the HP gear. Further discussion on the possible influence of the airflow on the oil motion within the gearbox and assistance to improve the traditional internal airflow models used for bearing chamber sealing analysis was also made. Three dimensional geometry modeling and inclusion of the oil phase are considered feasible. Such further investigations would aid the understanding of the interaction between the induced airflow due to the rotating components and oil motion, and their impact on oil scavenging behaviour and `windage' contribution to heat oil...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a numerical modelling strategy for simulating the flow around a shrouded spiral bevel gear. The strategy is then applied to a series of parametric variations of key shroud parameters. The shroud and gear in question are generic, although based upon those employed in the <b>internal</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> of a Rolls-Royce aeroengine. The need to shroud the gear {{comes from the fact that}} a spiral bevel gear, when rotated, acts like a fan. Work is done by the gear to move the surrounding fluid, usually air with oil particles suspended in it, which creates a parasitic loss, referred to as the windage power loss. The work within this thesis is part of a larger project which has investigated how windage power loss can be affected by geometric features of gears and shrouds. This is important as for large diameter (> 200 mm) bevel gears running at high speeds (> 10, 000 RPM) the windage power loss forms a substantial part of the total power loss. The modelling strategy has been developed in this work by studying 4 different fluid flow settings: Taylor-Couette flow, Conical Taylor-Couette flow, an unshrouded spiral bevel gear, and a shrouded spiral bevel gear. Work on Taylor-Couette flow provided a basic setting in which to trial various numerical techniques and gain familiarity with the commercial CFD program which would be used throughout this thesis (FLUENT), along with the meshing program GAMBIT. It gave an understanding of the flow, which was then used to simulate the flow in a modification of Taylor-Couette flow where the cylinders are replaced with cones, called Conical Taylor-Couette flow. Comparisons were made between 4 popular turbulence models, allowing a decision to be made on the `best' turbulence model to use in the modelling of a shrouded gear, and to start to develop the strategy. This strategy was then applied to the more complex geometry of an unshrouded gear, simulating experimental data which had been created on an in-house rig. To confirm the applicability of the strategy to modelling shrouded spiral bevel gears, it was applied to two shrouds for which experimental data was available. It showed that numerical modelling can capture the relative performance of the shrouds well. The work then continued by considering a series of parametric variations, whereby 3 key shroud parameters are each varied in 3 manners, producing 27 variations. Each of these parameters can affect the windage power loss: an assessment of how much each parameter affects windage power loss has been given. A description of the flow field in `good' and `bad' cases has been given, and through approximating the flow by using the compressible form of Bernoulli's equation, reasons for a `bad' shroud being `bad' have been presented...|$|R

40|$|The <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> {{represents}} an important mechanical sub system. In machine tools, the propose of a <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> {{is to provide}} a series of useful output speeds so that the machining operation can be carried out at its most optimum operating conditions high spindle speeds with low feed rate for roughing operations. An important aspect in the design of machine tool transmission is to keep the cost and volume of the <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> to a minimum. The probabilistic approach to design has been considered to be more rational compared to the conventional design approach based on the factor of safety. The existence of uncertainties in either engineering simulations or manufacturing processes calls for a reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) model for robust and cost-effective designs. In the present work a three shaft four speed <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> is designed using reliability principles. For the specified reliability of the system (<b>Gear</b> <b>box),</b> component reliability (<b>Gear</b> pair) is calculated by considering the system as a series system.

40|$|This is {{a thesis}} about {{the control of}} {{magnetic}} gears. A decade ago (2001) the first modern prototype magnetic <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> was constructed using rare earth magnets (NdFeB). Magnetic <b>gear</b> <b>boxes</b> have some desirable properties not found in their mechanical <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> counterparts, these include: contact-less torque transmission, lubrication-free, reduced noise and vibration, and non-destructive torque overload capability. Hitherto, no detailed investigation or analysis has been conducted {{on the effects of}} using a magnetic <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> in place of a mechanical <b>gear</b> <b>box.</b> As will be demonstrated in this thesis, magnetic gears possess a number of undesirable properties which must be given due consideration when designing speed and position controllers. In particular, unlike mechanical <b>gear</b> <b>boxes,</b> magnetic <b>gear</b> <b>boxes</b> have extremely low torsional rigidity. Furthermore, the torque transfer characteristic is fundamentally nonlinear and magnetic <b>gear</b> <b>boxes</b> have the potential to ‘slip’. On the one hand, ‘slipping’ is a great benefit as a non-destructive ‘torque fuse’; but on the other, this represents a consequential loss of control. This thesis examines the control issues that arise {{through the use of a}} specially constructed magnetic coupling integrated into an experimental test rig. The development of a linearized mathematical model of the experimental magnetic coupling is used to derive optimized classical controllers for speed and position, demonstrating outstanding theoretical and experimental results. To compensate for the possibility of ‘slip’, a methodology is presented for the detection and recovery from what is defined as ‘pole-slip’ in a magnetic coupling. To avert ‘pole-slip’, a model predictive control (MPC) scheme is developed that prevents over-torque pole-slipping. Feedback linearization is considered for a nonlinear model of the magnetic coupling and nonlinear control laws and state transformations are derived to produce perfect linearization, for both speed and position control, over the entire operating range of the experimental magnetic coupling...|$|R
