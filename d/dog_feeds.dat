5|$|A {{tattoo on}} his arm {{identifies}} Tom Nero, and the rope still around his neck shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown {{to have as much}} feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; his eye is put out just as his horse's was, and a <b>dog</b> <b>feeds</b> on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one {{of its kind in the}} first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear for the audience. Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that certain slow {{neurological}} diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (also known as "mad cow" disease) could be transmitted through contaminated food intake by animals; therefore, the examination of meat components in commercial feeds is important for the control of the disease in public health. The combination of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLPs) technique was applied to examine the meat components in dog and cat commercial feeds. The partial nucleotide sequence (359 bp) of animal mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb, CYT) gene was amplified by PCR and then digested with restriction enzyme Alu I or Mbo I. In this work, eight brands of commercial dog and cat feeds available in Taiwan were examined. All brands of <b>dog</b> <b>feeds</b> that were tested contained meat from four different animals (cattle, pig, goat and chicken). In cat feeds, the chicken meat was found in five out of eight brands...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the demographics, diet and {{activity}} in a defined population of 460 insured Swedish dogs between 1 and 3 years was presented. The {{data was collected}} by using a mail and telephone questionnaire. The repeatability (the questionnaire repeated to the same dog owners) and validity (questionnaire compared to 7 -day weighed registration of dietary intake and recording of activity) of the questionnaire were examined, and shown to be good to excellent {{for most of the}} parameters measured. Also, the most commonly used commercial <b>dog</b> <b>feeds</b> were analysed, and the results were compared to the declared values and to the recommended nutrient profiles. The insured dogs were shown to be representative for all Swedish dogs of the same age. A typical Swedish dog consumed 75 % of the energy intake from commercial feeds, and a smaller part as table foods, but with large variations between individuals. Most of the dogs were fed total diets supplying adequate amounts of the nutrients compared to the recommended nutrient profiles. Total diets that did cause deviations from recommended levels were most commonly those consisting of only table foods (too low levels of vitamins and minerals) or commercial feeds supplied with extra vitamin and mineral supplements (too high levels of vitamins and minerals). The total energy intakes were comparable to previously published studies on maintenance energy requirements of adult dogs, but varied due to sex, breed and weight. Three quarters of the dogs performed some type of activity for one hour or more per day, but although substantial variations were recorded, {{there was no significant difference}} in energy intake that could be related to the amount of activity recorded. There was a tendency (P= 0. 07) that the general temperament of the dog had an influence on the energy intake. The analysed protein and fat content in commercial feeds was on average highly correlated with the declared values and with the recommended nutrient profiles. However, especially the calcium but also other minerals of commercial <b>dog</b> <b>feeds</b> often deviated from declared values, and did not always meet the AAFCO (2000) nutrient profiles. More expensive feeds had the same magnitude of deviation from declared energy and nutrient values as did feeds of a lower cost. This validated questionnaire could be used to collect data on dietary intake and activity in future epidemiological studies in order to quantify the influence of these factors of the effects on health and disease in defined populations of dogs...|$|E

50|$|One way to {{help prevent}} bloat is to spread out the Weimaraner's feedings to at least twice daily and to avoid any {{vigorous}} exercise an hour before or after meals. It is also recommended that the <b>dog's</b> <b>feeding</b> dish not be placed on a raised platform to discourage it from gobbling its food too quickly and keep air from entering the stomach.

40|$|Situated in {{a broader}} anthropocentric and speciesist structure, carnism serves to {{perpetuate}} the objectification and exploitation of other animals. In this paper, carnistic thinking is examined {{in the context of}} how it is commonly applied to dogs, who are framed as lovable, yet subordinate to humans. Through critically discussing the social system of domestication, and by relating carnistic ideology and practice to common anthropocentric conceptions of dogs as carnivores, the objective of this essay is to scrutinize online discussions of raw flesh-based <b>dog</b> <b>feeding</b> practices. The analysis shows how underlying ethical rationales used to motivate <b>feeding</b> <b>dogs</b> other animals intersect with wider anthropocentric ideology and aid in reiterating the exploitation and domination of other animals...|$|R

The increased friction reduces the slipping of lower layers (which contact the <b>feed</b> <b>dogs)</b> versus the upper layers (which tend to be held in place by the presser foot).|$|R

40|$|Phytases {{produced}} by Aspergillus niger have improved the digestibility of nutriments in monogastric such as poultry, turkey and swine. However, no published articles {{were found on}} the use of the enzyme in the <b>dog</b> <b>feed</b> based in canola as source of protein and fiber. Twelve German Sheepherd adult dogs (mean BW 27 kg and 2 - 3 years of age) were use to asses the effect of four levels of phytase addition (0, 250, 500 and 1, 000 Units) in the consumption and digestibility of canola based commercial feed. The feed was pelleted and the enzyme was added manually at the time of feeding. The dry matter intake tended to be reduced as the phytase level was increased (p 1) was reduced (p< 0. 05) with the addition of 250 and 500 phytase units. However, nutrient digestibility was augmented (p< 0. 05) on all the levels of the enzyme. In conclusion, the addition of phytase to the <b>dog</b> pelleted <b>feed</b> increased the use of nutrients in the gut...|$|R

50|$|A {{variety of}} mites cause mild {{dermatitis}} in their hosts and biting nuisance and disgust {{to the owners}} of domestic animals. Cheyletiella blakei, the cat fur mite is typical. These mites live within the fur of cats and <b>dogs,</b> <b>feeding</b> on sloughed scales of skin. Often this causes little reaction in the host, but pruritus, seborrhea and pustules in the skin may develop as an allergic reaction to the mites. The adult mites are visible crawling in the fur and may cause similar skin reactions in the pet's owner. Other genera of mites that cause similar problems in colonies of rodents are Myobia and Myocoptes. The genus Megninia has species found on the feathers of poultry birds.|$|R
