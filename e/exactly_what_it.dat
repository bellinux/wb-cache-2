25|$|RoboMary {{can examine}} the {{computer}} brain of similar non-color-locked robots {{when they look}} at a red tomato, and see exactly how they react and what kinds of impulses occur. RoboMary can also construct a simulation of her own brain, unlock the simulation's color-lock and, with reference to the other robots, simulate exactly how this simulation of herself reacts to seeing a red tomato. RoboMary naturally has control over all of her internal states except for the color-lock. With the knowledge of her simulation's internal states upon seeing a red tomato, RoboMary can put her own internal states directly into the states they would be in upon seeing a red tomato. In this way, without ever seeing a red tomato through her cameras, she will know <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is like to see a red tomato.|$|E
25|$|For all its {{usefulness}} in resolving questions regarding infinite sets, naive set theory has some fatal flaws. In particular, it is prey to logical paradoxes {{such as those}} exposed by Russell's paradox. The discovery of these paradoxes revealed that not all sets which {{can be described in}} the language of naive set theory can actually be said to exist without creating a contradiction. The 20th century saw a resolution to these paradoxes {{in the development of the}} various axiomatizations of set theories such as ZFC and NBG in common use today. However, the gap between the very formalized and symbolic language of these theories and our typical informal use of mathematical language results in various paradoxical situations, as well as the philosophical question of <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is that such formal systems actually propose to be talking about.|$|E

However, the game surpassed many expectations; in his review, GameSpy's Gabe Graziani asked readers the rhetorical question; [...] "Notice that I didn't mention the Halo3 beta offer during this whole article?

500|$|Warp {{drive was}} first {{mentioned}} in Gene Roddenberry's first-draft pitch for Star Trek, dated March 11, 1964, although in that version it {{was referred to}} as a [...] "space-warp drive". The drive allows for a vessel to travel faster than the speed of light by warping space-time around the ship itself. In 1994, physicist Miguel Alcubierre created the theoretical Alcubierre drive, which used a similar theory. In the Star Trek universe, Zefram Cochrane invented the drive in 2063. Cochrane was portrayed by James Cromwell in the film [...] and re-appeared in this role in the pilot of Enterprise, [...] "". That episode showed the culmination of the development of the warp 5 engine, which was designed by Jonathan Archer's father, Henry, in the launch of the Enterprise itself. The Vulcans during this period gave oversight and advice to Starfleet {{in the development of the}} warp drive, but sought to slow the progress of the humans. [...] "First Flight" [...] showed a previously unseen period in the development of the fictional warp drive, with the pursuit of the warp 2 barrier.
