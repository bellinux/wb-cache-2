50|$|There {{are many}} {{positive}} effects of inclusions where both the {{students with special needs}} along with the other students in the classroom both benefit. Research has shown positive effects for children with disabilities in areas such as reaching individualized education program (IEP) goal, improving communication and social skills, increasing positive peer interactions, many educational outcomes, and post school adjustments. Positive effects on children without disabilities include the development of positive attitudes and perceptions of persons with disabilities and the enhancement of social status with non-disabled peers.Several studies have been done on the effects of inclusion of children with disabilities in <b>general</b> <b>education</b> <b>classrooms.</b> A study on inclusion compared integrated and segregated (special education only) preschool students. The study determined that children in the integrated sites progressed in social skills development while the segregated children actually regressed. Another study shows the effect on inclusion in grades 2 to 5.

5000|$|The [...] "free" [...] public {{education}} means educational services {{must be provided}} at public expense, under public supervision and direction, and without charge to parents except for fees that are charged for all students.

First, the state must have [...] "complied with the procedures {{set forth in the}} Act". These procedures enable parents of a disabled child to examine school records, participate in meetings, and present complaints. Parents must also be given notice of any proposals to change the educational placement of a child, and they are entitled to an independent educational evaluation. They can initiate an impartial due process hearing for failure to comply with the Act and bring a subsequent civil action challenging an adverse determination at the hearing. Second, the IEP that is developed must be [...] "reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits".

This can either be accomplished by separating students with special needs or keeping them included in the <b>general</b> <b>education</b> <b>classroom.</b> In an inclusive setting, students are educated in the <b>general</b> <b>education</b> <b>classroom.</b> There are usually less students with more teacher assistance.

40|$|Behavior {{management}} in the <b>general</b> <b>education</b> <b>classroom</b> can be difficult at times for educators. Attention is one reinforcer of children 2 ̆ 7 s behavior {{in the classroom and}} the child 2 ̆ 7 s behavior may be maintained by teacher attention or peer attention. If attentions is implemented appropriately, peer or teacher attention may prove to be an effective reinforcer in maintaining appropriate behaviors in the classroom. Teacher attention is commonly used to maintain student performance (Broussard 2 ̆ 6 Northup, 1997). Educators may not know which is more reinforcing to the typical student in the <b>general</b> <b>education</b> <b>classroom</b> - teacher attention or peer attention. However, evaluating the effectiveness of such a reinforcer involves evaluating the preference for an intervention, rather than a specific stimulus that can be arranged in a traditional stimulus preference assessment (Hagopian, Long, 2 ̆ 6 Rush, 2004; Hanley, Iwata, 2 ̆ 6 Lindberg, 1999). A modified concurrent-chains assessment can be used to determine the reinforcer preference of individuals (Hanley, 2010).

40|$|Over the years, federal special {{education}} and accountability policies have aligned more closely to require that students with disabilities receive individualized instruction in <b>general</b> <b>education</b> <b>classrooms.</b> Thus, for an increasing percentage of students with disabilities, these policies now mandate that Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) are written at annual IEP meetings and then implemented in <b>general</b> <b>education</b> <b>classrooms.</b> The practice of providing services and instruction to {{students with disabilities in}} <b>general</b> <b>education</b> <b>classrooms</b> is commonly referred to as inclusion. Inclusion theoretically requires collaboration between general and {{special education}} teachers to ensure that students with disabilities receive appropriate services and supports in <b>general</b> <b>education</b> <b>classrooms.</b> Numerous studies examining the practices of inclusion have led scholars to critique how inclusion is being implemented and whether it is really supporting student learning. This said, little work has empirically examined the influence that NCLB (2001) and IDEA (2004) have on general and special education teachers’ practices in inclusive settings, and ultimately the effect this has on students’ access to an appropriate education. My dissertation research is comprised of separate studies that explore the implementation of two key policy mandates within inclusive settings: (1) creation, implementation, and progress monitoring of IEPs, and (2) standards-based instruction by highly qualified teachers. Specifically, in my first study I explore the role of the IEP process in the education of students with specific learning disabilities receiving instruction in inclusive classrooms.
