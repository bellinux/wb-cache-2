6000|$|... 'I thought so,' said Mary Hacket. 'I told Connie {{that such}} a child could not {{possibly}} have been a willing party to his fraud--for fraud, I fear, it was--Miss Mohun. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> any hope of her recovering the sum she advanced.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{did not say}} so," [...] the Inspector {{answered}} warily. [...] "By the bye, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> {{would be}} any chance of five minutes' interview with your chief?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We must drink {{as little}} as we can, Zaki, and give the horses only a mouthful, now and then, and let them munch the shrubs and get a little {{moisture}} from them. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> any fear of the Dervishes following our tracks?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{should have}} thought him the very man {{to fall in love}} young, like his father. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> any chance for either of the Edmonstones? Laura's beauty he spoke of, but it was not in a very lover-like way. Do you admire Laura so much?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We hate it, sir," [...] Charlie said. [...] "We would, both of us, a {{thousand}} times rather enlist under you as private soldiers.

6000|$|... "Thrown {{down the}} wall!" [...] exclaimed Lady Brandon, scarlet with indignation and pale with {{apprehension}} by turns. [...] "What a disgraceful thing! Where are the police? Chester, {{will you come}} with me and see what they are doing? Sir Charles is no use. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> any danger?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] said Captain Horn. [...] "Our {{force is}} small, {{and we can}} only spare one man.

6000|$|... "By the way, Bathurst," [...] the Doctor said, {{suddenly}} {{changing his}} conversation, [...] "what {{do you think}} of this talk we hear about chupaties being sent round among the native troops, and the talk about greased cartridges.

6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} my brother--he's a soldier at Windsor," [...] said Hetty, frightened at the landlord's {{questioning}} look. [...] "I can't afford to go by the coach; <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there's</b> a cart goes toward Ashby in the morning?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One does {{talk of the}} Devil on Sunday, for {{he is in the}} catechism," [...] {{returned}} Eugene. [...] "If {{he carries}} Mr. Arden off, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> will be a great smoke, and that folk will see it?" ...|$|R
