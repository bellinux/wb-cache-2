5|$|The {{utility of}} Feynman {{diagrams}} {{is that other}} types of physical phenomena {{that are part of}} the general picture of fundamental interactions but are conceptually separate from forces can also be described using the same rules. For example, a Feynman diagram can <b>describe</b> <b>in</b> succinct detail how a neutron decays into an electron, proton, and neutrino, an interaction mediated by the same gauge boson that is responsible for the weak nuclear force.|$|E

Howell and Ford brought to light a large amount of new information about Merrick.

They refuted some of the inaccuracies in Treves's account, showing that Merrick's mother did not abandon him, and that Merrick deliberately chose to exhibit himself to make a living.|$|E

He talks about the biogeographic patterns he observes and their implications for natural history, in terms both of the movement of species and of the geologic history of the region. He also narrates some of his personal experiences during his travels. The final chapter is an overview of the ethnic, linguistic, and cultural divisions among the people who live in the region and speculation about what such divisions might indicate about their history.|$|E

25|$|Britannia is a county-by-county {{description}} of Great Britain and Ireland. It {{is a work}} of chorography: a study that relates landscape, geography, antiquarianism, and history.

By this method, he produced the first coherent picture of Roman Britain.|$|E
25|$|Beyond stylistic {{elements}} which {{spread throughout}} Asia {{for close to}} a millennium, the main contribution of Greco-Buddhist art to the Buddhist faith {{may be in the}} Greek-inspired idealistic realism which helped <b>describe</b> <b>in</b> a visual and immediately understandable manner the state of personal bliss and enlightenment proposed by Buddhism. The communication of deeply human approach of the Buddhist faith, and its accessibility to all have probably benefited from the Greco-Buddhist artistic syncretism.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} a few poems in Purananuru, which are {{classified}} as attruppatais. Attruppatai poems read like travelogues in which poets who were returning with gifts, received from a king, encourage other poets {{to do the same}} by describing the glory of the king and his country. This gives an opportunity to the poet, among other topics, to <b>describe</b> <b>in</b> great detail the natural beauty, fertility, and resources of the territory that has to be traversed to reach the palace of the patron.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} myths were those describing {{the creation of the}} world. The Egyptian developed many accounts of the creation, which differ greatly in the events they <b>describe.</b> <b>In</b> particular, the deities credited with creating the world vary in each account. This difference partly reflects the desire of Egypt's cities and priesthoods to exalt their own patron gods by attributing creation to them. Yet the differing accounts were not regarded as contradictory; instead, the Egyptians saw the creation process as having many aspects and involving many divine forces.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{believe the}} description is of a far later date than Moses' time, {{and that it}} reflects {{the structure of the}} Temple of Solomon; others hold that the passage describes a real pre-monarchic shrine, perhaps the sanctuary at Shiloh, while traditional scholars contend that it describes an actual tabernacle used in the time of Moses and thereafter. This view is based on Exodus 36, 37, 38 and 39 that <b>describe</b> <b>in</b> full detail how the actual construction of the Tabernacle took place during the time of Moses.|$|E
25|$|When 1 ≤ p < ∞, {{the real}} Hardy spaces Hp {{discussed}} further {{down in this}} article are easy to <b>describe</b> <b>in</b> the present context. A real function f on the unit circle belongs to the real Hardy space Hp(T) if it is the real part of a function in Hp(T), and a complex function f belongs to the real Hardy space iff Re(f) and Im(f) belong to the space (see the section on real Hardy spaces below). Thus for 1 ≤ p < ∞, the real Hardy space contains the Hardy space, but is much bigger, since no relationship is imposed between the real and imaginary part of the function.|$|E
25|$|The {{differential}} equation form {{is used for}} scientific or mission-planning purposes. According to Newton's laws, {{the sum of all}} the forces acting on a body will equal the mass of the body times its acceleration (F = ma). Therefore accelerations can be expressed in terms of positions. The perturbation terms are much easier to <b>describe</b> <b>in</b> this form. Predicting subsequent positions and velocities from initial values of position and velocity corresponds to solving an initial value problem. Numerical methods calculate the positions and velocities of the objects a short time in the future, then repeat the calculation ad nauseam. However, tiny arithmetic errors from the limited accuracy of a computer's math are cumulative, which limits the accuracy of this approach.|$|E

25|$|Every type of experiential content {{belonging}} to samsara and nirvana has, as its very basis, a natural {{state that is}} a spontaneously present buddha—a dimension of purity and perfection, that is perfect by nature. This natural state is not created by a profound buddha nor by a clever sentient being. Independent of causality, causes did not produce it and conditions can not make it perish. This state is one of self-existing wakefulness, defying all that words can <b>describe,</b> <b>in</b> a way that also transcends {{the reach of the}} intellect and thoughts. It is within the nonarising vastness of such a basic natural state that all phenomena {{belonging to}} samsara and nirvana are, essentially and without any exception, a state of buddha—purity and perfection.|$|E
25|$|During the Trent Bridge Test Match of 1998 South Africa batted first, scoring 374 {{in their}} first innings. England responded with 336, with Donald taking 5 wickets. In their second innings, South Africa only scored 208 leaving England a target of 247 to win the match. Michael Atherton was at the crease when Donald began a spell of bowling both would later <b>describe</b> <b>in</b> their {{respective}} autobiographies {{as one of the}} most intense periods of Test Match Cricket they ever played. Donald bowled multiple bouncers to Atherton, but he survived several close chances to remain not out at the end of the day. The next day Atherton along with Alec Stewart were able to score the remaining runs, with Atherton finishing on 98. Several years later, Atherton gave Donald the gloves he wore on this occasion for Donald's benefit year auction.|$|E

Just to hedge his bets, he also attempted to get himself re-classified as a military prisoner, as he had heard of a possible exchange of military prisoners. The Boers regarded him as a significant prisoner, because of his initiative in attempting to get the train moving and allowing the engine to escape, because of his reputation as a war correspondent, and because he was a minor member of the aristocracy whose father {{had been a member of}} the British government. Nonetheless, it transpired that the authorities were seriously considering the possibility of accepting his offer to withdraw from the war, which later gave rise to accusations he had broken his agreement when he resumed reporting after his escape.|$|E
