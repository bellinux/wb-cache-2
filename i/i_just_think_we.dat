2500|$|Hunt was {{speaking}} to the LSE about socially responsible broadcasting, and stated [...] "I do think the BBC is a socially responsible broadcaster, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> need to hear that." [...] He argued that broadcasters were not being ambitious enough, and outlined his party's plans, should it be elected to government at the next general election, to relax regulation for those broadcasters who agreed to provide only socially responsible output. In addition to citing the Ross/Brand/Sachs affair as a [...] "perfect example" [...] of where such a [...] "responsibility deal" [...] could have operated, he also pointed to Channel 4 as an example, stating that it was [...] "not good enough" [...] for it to produce [...] "worthy" [...] programmes such as Dispatches documenting alcohol abuse in the US, whilst {{at the same time}} it was broadcasting programmes such as Hollyoaks where such abuse took up, according to his estimates, 18% of screen time. The culture spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, Don Foster, criticised this idea, stating that it threatened the very foundational principles of freedom and independence of British media, arguing that such government interference in television programming would be [...] "a very sad day for British broadcasting", and pointing out that regulatory mechanisms already exist to deal with issues such as this.|$|E

The cap'n, he see'd you come up, an' said you bounced out o' the water like the cork of a soda-water bottle. But here he comes himself. He told me I wasn't to speak much to you." ...|$|E
5000|$|Nickell {{explained}} his philosophy to Blake Smith of the Skeptic podcast [...] "MonsterTalk", I don't like debunkers and I don't like dismissers, {{people who are}} just trying to say, [...] "Oh,humbug... Those people were probably drunk or lying or hoaxing." [...] <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> shouldn't do that. If I'm studying vampires, I don't have to believe they exist to talk about the history of vampires, the cultural and literary history. There are many aspects, all worthy of some scholarly discussion.|$|E
5000|$|Gillanders {{believes}} that the environment and industrial expansion can coexist in Spencer Gulf. In 2011 she commented: [...] "I used {{to think it was}} either the environment or industrial development, that you couldn't have both... but I think we've moved beyond that now, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> can mesh both together such that we get positive outcomes for both the environment and the industry." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "In {{the last}} year or so I had a bit of a {{confidence}} crash. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>just</b> because <b>we</b> got a lot more popular very quickly - which isn’t to say we suddenly reached Bon Jovi status, but lots more people tuned in - that meant the scrutiny was a lot higher and people would come to shows with such high expectations" [...] —Lenman ...|$|R
500|$|Martin, who {{finished}} second, was candid about the result, [...] "We did really well to finish second. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> were in [...] league today." [...] In the post-race press conference, Kenseth {{said of his}} result, [...] "We didn't qualify very good, but we were really happy with our car. When the race started, I didn't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> were quite {{as good as we}} were yesterday (in practice), but we were able to have really good pit stops." [...] Logano, who was involved in the biggest accident of the race, [...] "The biggest thing was, I was fine the whole time, [...] I'm not really sure what happened. The spotter was clearing me low. When I got down there, they checked up going into the corner and I got tagged from behind." ...|$|R
5000|$|NBC chief Robert Greenblatt said {{of their}} {{decision}} {{to pass on the}} series: [...] "We just decided that it didn't hold together well enough to yield a series. It looked beautiful and original and creative, but it just all ultimately didn't come together... it just didn't ultimately creatively all work. We felt great about that cast, but we tried to make it not just a sitcom. We tried to make it an hour, which ultimately has more dramatic weight than a half-hour. It's hard to calibrate how much weirdness vs. supernatural vs. family story. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> didn’t get the mix right".|$|E
5000|$|This time on {{the record}} it seemed like we've {{come to the point}} where we feel {{confident}} enough to bring these influences to the fore. Because we also feel that we've got nothing to lose as well, after all this time. We've got nothing to prove as much as we've got nothing to lose. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> went for it, we didn't really think too hard about what the consequences would be, but I don’t think we went stupidly too far into the realms of progressive rock myself, it's just the right balance between that and everything else that the band's about.|$|E
5000|$|Cave later {{declared}} the recording, [...] "a documentary {{of the group}} in utter collapse. The four songs are utterly dissimilar to each other because we all {{knew it was the}} last record and there was no longer any union within the group. It's not like we reached a point where we couldn't get any better. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> dissolved mid-climb.Cave claimed there were tensions within the band at the recording sessions. [...] "I knew that I wasn't getting along creatively with Rowland Howard, but we were still friends. There were different conflicts but it's kind of hard to put my finger on what they were now," [...] he said.|$|E
50|$|As we {{came around}} the way, {{there were a lot}} of Jewish inmates coming out of the camp, and I heard that the gate was opened by our {{advanced}} scouts. They took a rifle and shot it. I think it was a fellow from Hawaii that did that. I think it was a Captain Taylor, Company B was one of them, but another person from Hawaii, he passed away. They opened the gate and all these German, I mean, Jewish victims were coming out of the camp.Then, when we finally opened the Dachau camp, got in, oh those people were so afraid of us, I guess. You could see the fear in their face. But eventually, they realized that we were there to liberate them and help them.They were all just skin and bones, sunken eyes. I think they were more dead than they were alive because they hadn't eaten so much because, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>just</b> before <b>we</b> got there the S.S. people had all pulled back up and they were gone. But, we went there, and outside of the camps {{there were a lot of}} railroad cars there that had bodies in them. I had the opportunity to go into the camp there, but you could smell the stench. The people were dead and piled up in the buildings, and it was just unbelievable that the Germans could do that to the Jewish people. I really didn't think it was possible at all actually.|$|R

5000|$|In a March 4, 2001 {{interview}} with Tony Snow, Byrd said of race relations: They're much, {{much better than}} they've ever been in my life-time ... I think we talk about race too much. I think those problems are largely behind us ... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> talk so much about it that we help to create somewhat of an illusion. I think we try to have good will. My old mom told me, 'Robert, you can't go to heaven if you hate anybody.' We practice that. There are white niggers. I've {{seen a lot of}} white niggers in my time, {{if you want to use}} that word. We just need to work together to make our country a better country, and I'd just as soon quit talking about it so much.|$|E
5000|$|Thirteen {{believes}} {{that neither the}} money or Jennifer {{will be able to}} make Cyrus happy because each person's level of happiness or sadness is set into their DNA - with nothing being able to change it. Her cynical mood both intrigues and surprises House, who has a similar outlook. House actively begins trying to deduce why Thirteen's outlook on Cyrus and Jennifer's romance is so jaded. He brings her old high-school boyfriend to the hospital thinking that being dumped caused her to not believe that love can be rekindled - however it turns out he dumped her because she hooked up with his sister instead. Thirteen tells House, [...] "Here's the dirty little secret. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are who we are. And I think lotteries are stupid." ...|$|E
5000|$|In November 2016, after Trump won {{the presidential}} election, Macy's CEO Terry Lundgren {{said he had}} no regrets about discontinuing the Trump collection. Lundgren said that {{regardless}} of Trump's controversial comment regarding Mexican immigrants, Macy's still would have discontinued the line because of Trump's entry into politics: [...] "If Hillary Clinton had a line of women's suits or handbags I wouldn't carry those either. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> don't want to be a politically associated company, we sell to everybody at Macy's and have a broad and diverse customer base." [...] Fortune reported that a purported boycott of Macy's by Trump's presidential supporters [...] "conceivably took a toll" [...] after Macy's experienced seven quarterly losses. Lundgren said that Trump's call for a boycott [...] "certainly didn't help but it's hard to pinpoint if it had any impact." ...|$|E

2500|$|William G. Dever said, [...] "I'm not a Christian. I'm not a believer. I don't {{have a dog}} in this fight. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> it's a shame the {{way this}} story is being hyped and manipulated." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{amount of}} tweets {{and the amount}} of emails we get saying that people couldn’t get a hold of certain songs… <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> to put it all on one album was such a great idea,” she says.|$|R
