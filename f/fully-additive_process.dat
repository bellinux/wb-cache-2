This process is Green (non-corrosive chemicals), On-Demand (quick-to-print), Scalable (large-format printing) and Low-Cost vis-à-vis Subtractive printing, a complex deposition-cum-etching process that otherwise requires expensive/sophisticated specialized IC-like facilities and is Un-Green, Not-On-Demand, Un-scalable and High-Cost. The proposed <b>Fully-Additive</b> <b>process</b> features printed transistors with high (∼ 1. 5 cm 2 /Vs) semiconductor carrier-mobility, ∼ 3 × higher than competing state-of-the-art Fully-Additive processes and comparable to Subtractive processes. Furthermore, passive elements including capacitors, resistors, and inductors, and two metal-interconnect layers are likewise Fully-Additive printed–to our knowledge, to-date the only <b>Fully-Additive</b> <b>process</b> capable of realizing complex circuits/systems on flexible plastic films. Several analog and mixed-signal circuits are demonstrated, including proposed and conventional differential amplifiers, and a charge-redistribution 4 -bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The proposed amplifier embodies a novel positive-cum-negative feedback to simultaneously significantly improve the gain and reduce susceptibility to process variations. To improve {{the speed and}} reduce {{the area of the}} DAC, the parasitic capacitors therein are exploited. The Fully-Additive proposed amplifier and DAC are benchmarked against reported realizations (all Subtractive-based processes), and are shown to be highly competitive despite its realization based on the simple low-cost proposed <b>Fully-Additive</b> <b>process...</b>|$|E
