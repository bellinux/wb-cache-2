40|$|<b>Dynamic</b> <b>ductile</b> <b>fracture</b> is a {{three stages}} process {{controlled}} by nucleation, growth and finally coalescence of voids. In the present work, a theoretical model, dedicated to nucleation {{and growth of}} voids during dynamic pressure loading, is developed. Initially, the material is free of voids but has potential sites for nucleation. A void nucleates from an existing site when the cavitation pressure pc is reached. A Weibull probability law is {{used to describe the}} distribution of the cavitation pressure among potential nucleation sites. During the initial growth, the effect of material properties is essentially appearing through the magnitude of pc. In the later stages, the matrix softening due to the increase of porosity has to be taken into account.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of the <b>dynamic</b> deformation and <b>ductile</b> <b>fracture</b> of notched tensile specimens {{have been carried}} out using the finite element hydrocode DYNA 2 D and advanced constitutive relations for both pure copper and Remko iron. The predictions of plastic flow were in good agreement with the observed shape at fracture of specimens tested dynamically in a unique impact test facility known as the 'flying wedge' which is capable of applying strain-rates in the range 102 - 104 s- 1. The DYNA 2 D results were used to give accurate predictions of the triaxial state-of-stress (defined as the ratio of mean stress P to effective stress Y) at the fracture initiation site as a function of initial geometry, mean strain and strain-rate. Experimentally-measured failure strains were then plotted against predicted values of P/Y for each material. For copper, failure strains decreased with increasing stress triaxiality P/Y but no significant strain-rate effect was apparent. In the case of iron, the same trend of reducing fracture strain with increase in P/Y was observed, but here increased strain-rate produced a marked effect. In fact, a ductile-brittle transition (confirmed by metallurgical examination) was seen to occur at the highest speed of testing and above a certain value of P/Y. Parameters for simple empirical fracture models were estimated from the plots of failure strain versus P/Y. When combined with the standard damage accumulation fracture criterion in DYNA 2 D, these models gave reasonable predictions of both the site of fracture initiation (ie the centre of the specimen) and the time-to-fracture when compared with fracture times measured on certain specimens using strain-gauges or high-speed photography.

40|$|AbstractInvestigation {{of running}} ductile {{fracture}} in gas transmission pipelines and the derivation of reliable crack arrest prediction methods belong to major topics in pipeline research. The yet available crack arrest criterion, {{known as the}} Battelle Two-Curve Method (BTCM), leads to reliable predictions up to grade X 70 line pipe steels for which it has been validated. This includes specific limits in terms of mechanical properties, pressure and geometry. The application of this criterion to modern pipeline steels, i. e. especially grades X 80 and beyond in combination with larger diameters and high pressure, has led to mispredictions of the BTCM. Hence, {{in order to ensure}} safe design of pipelines, new methods are required based on in depth knowledge and appropriate characterization of material resistance. This paper presents a procedure for the assessment of <b>dynamic</b> <b>ductile</b> <b>fracture</b> resistance based on combined experimental and numerical investigations. The procedure involves quasi-static and dynamic drop- weight tear testing (DWTT) on modified specimens with pre-fatigued crack for grades X 65, X 80 and X 100 materials, and the application of cohesive zone (CZ) and Gurson-Tveergard-Needleman (GTN) models to describe ductile material damage. The damage model parameters are calibrated on basis of DWTT results and subsequently used to simulate dynamic crack propagation in a pipeline. The influence of material properties (strain hardening, toughness), pipe geometry, usage factor and decompression behaviour on ductile fracture propagation behaviour is studied and evaluated.

In this project, uniaxial tensile test was performed for three difference material that is aluminum, brass and mild steel. The objective of the test is to identify the value of uniaxial fracture strain for these three difference materials. The specimens have been divided into three difference area: L, P-lateral and S-middle zones. The zones are measured using optical microscope {{before and after the}} tensile test to determine the value of <b>ductile</b> <b>fracture</b> strain at those zones.

Recent efforts spent in investigating this aspect, that is the ductile fracture propagation control, have demonstrated that the class of X 100 large-diameter steel pipes being considered, when operated under severe operating conditions (high usage factor, rich gas, low temperature), may lie on the fracture propagation/arrest border line.

40|$|An {{in-depth}} {{understanding of}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>ductile</b> <b>fracture</b> {{is one of}} the most important steps to improve the survivability of critical structures such as the lost Twin Towers. In the present thesis, the macroscopic fracture modes and the fracture mechanisms of ductile structural components under high velocity impact are investigated numerically and theoretically. Attention is focused on the formation and propagation of through-thickness cracks, which is difficult to experimentally track down using currently available instruments. Studied are three typical and challenging types of impact problems: (i) rigid mass-to beam impact, (ii) the Taylor test, and (iii) dynamic compression tests on an axisymmetric hat specimen. Using an existing finite element code (ABAQUS/Explicit) implemented with the newly developed Bao-Wierzbicki's (BW) fracture criterion, a number of distinct failure modes including fragmentation, shear plugging, tensile tearing in rigid mass-to-beam impact, confined fracture, petalling, and shear cracking in the Taylor test, are successfully recreated for the first time in the open literature. All of the present predictions are in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. (cont.) This investigation convincingly demonstrates the applicability of the BW's fracture criterion to high velocity impact problems and at the same time provides an insight into deficiencies of existing fracture loci. Besides void growth, the adiabatic shear banding is another basic failure mechanism often encountered in high velocity impact. This failure mechanism and subsequent fracture is studied through numerical simulation of a recently conducted compression test on a hat specimen. The periodical occurrence of hot spots in the propagating adiabatic shear bands is successfully captured. The relation between hot spots and crack formation is revealed. The numerical predictions correlate well with experimental results. An explicit expression controlling through-thickness crack growth is proposed and verified by performing an extensive parametric study in a wide range of input variables. Using this expression, a two-stage analytical model is formulated for shear plugging of a beam/plate impacted by a flat-nosed projectile. Obtained theoretical solutions are compared with experimental results published in the literature showing very good agreement. (cont.) Three theoretical models for rigid mass-to-beam impact, the single, double, and multiple impact of beam-to-beam are derived from the momentum conservation principle.

Finite element calculations on different geometries were performed. Based on non-coupled (the Rice-Tracey model) and coupled (modified Gurson model) micromechanical approaches, crack initiation and onset of growth on tensile specimens have been analysed. Simplified procedure for determination of critical values of model parameters corresponding to <b>ductile</b> <b>fracture</b> initiation was proposed. Good transferability of parameters determined on simple geometry to the analysis of behaviour of precracked geometry in <b>ductile</b> <b>fracture</b> condition was established. End goal of investigations that are in progress is analysis of actual precracked structure by applying micromechanical approach and simplified method of determination of <b>ductile</b> <b>fracture</b> parameters...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, ductile crack growth in an {{aluminium}} alloy is numerically simulated using a cohesive zone model under both plane stress and plane strain conditions for two different fracture types, shear and normal modes. The cohesive law for <b>ductile</b> <b>fracture</b> {{consists of two}} parts - a specific material's separation traction and energy. Both {{are assumed to be}} constant during <b>ductile</b> <b>fracture</b> (stable crack growth). In order to verify the assumed cohesive law to be suitable for <b>ductile</b> <b>fracture</b> processes, experimental records are used as control curves for the numerical simulations. For a constant separation traction, determined experimentally from tension test data, the corresponding cohesive energy was determined by finite element calculations. It is confirmed that the cohesive zone model can be used to characterize a single <b>ductile</b> <b>fracture</b> mode and is roughly independent of stable crack extention. Both the cohesive traction and the cohesive fracture energy should be material specific parameters. The extension of the cohesive zone is restricted to a very small region ner the crack tip and is in the order of the physical fracture process. Based on the present observations, the cohesive zone model is a promising criterion to characterize <b>ductile</b> <b>fracture.</b> (orig.)
