6000|$|Robert's lodging was {{suddenly}} invaded {{by the two}} wild lads and their attendants. Finding themselves no better welcomed or amused than rude boys are wont to be by young men, they betook themselves to an upper room, the floor of which was formed by ill-laid, gaping planks, which were the ceiling of that below. Here they began to play at dice; they soon grew even more intolerably uproarious, and in the coarse of their quarrelsome, boisterous tricks, overthrew a vessel of dirty water, which began to <b>drip</b> <b>through</b> the interstices of the planks on their brother and his friends below--an accident sure to be welcomed by a hoarse laugh by the rough boys, but appearing to the victims beneath a deliberate insult. [...] "Are you a man not to avenge this shameful insolence?" [...] cried Robert's friends, Alberic and Ivo de Grantmesnil. In a fury of passion, Robert rushed after the lads with his sword drawn, and King William was roused from his sleep to hear that Lord Robert was murdering his brothers.|$|E
50|$|Canvas {{tarpaulins}} are not 100% waterproof, {{though they}} are water resistant. Thus, while {{a little bit of}} water {{for a short period of}} time will not affect them, when there is standing water on canvas tarps, or when water cannot quickly drain away from canvas tarps, the standing water will <b>drip</b> <b>through</b> this type of tarp.|$|E

25|$|Coffee percolators and {{automatic}} coffeemakers brew coffee using gravity. In an automatic coffeemaker, hot water drips onto coffee grounds that {{are held in}} a paper, plastic, or perforated metal coffee filter, allowing the water to seep through the ground coffee while extracting its oils and essences. The liquid <b>drips</b> <b>through</b> the coffee and the filter into a carafe or pot, and the spent grounds are retained in the filter.|$|R
50|$|The {{one thing}} that all the stories {{have in common is}} the {{repeated}} use of water imagery. Many of the events take place at sea, but even the land-based plotlines have a connection to water. In Watercolors, for instance, the characters are plagued by water dripping through their ceiling. While its generally believed that water <b>drips</b> <b>through</b> the ceiling in Floating water, this is not true; this was just an element put into the films.|$|R
50|$|In some {{instances}} a device called a brouilleur was employed. A brouilleur is a glass or metal bowl which {{sits on the}} absinthe glass and acts like a personal absinthe fountain. Ice and water {{are added to the}} bowl, which has a small hole at the bottom, allowing the ice-cold water to slowly <b>drip</b> <b>through.</b> Sugar, if preferred, can be added directly to the bowl, or in some cases to a built-in grille.|$|E
50|$|Home coffee {{makers are}} simpler but {{work under the}} same principle. La Napoletana is a four-part stove-top unit with grounds loosely placed inside a filter; the kettle portion is filled with water and once boiling, the unit is {{inverted}} to <b>drip</b> <b>through</b> the grounds. The Moka per il caffè is a three-part stove-top unit that {{is placed on the}} stovetop with loosely packed grounds in a strainer; the water rises from steam pressure and is forced through the grounds into the top portion. In both cases, the water passes through the grounds just once.|$|E

During this process, a fine crushed material is heated at extremely high temperatures. The crushed material is then melted which <b>drips</b> <b>through</b> a furnace onto a boule. This boule where the corundum cools down and crystallizes, spins and thus causes the curved striations. Natural corundum does not form this way and lacks the curved striations.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{observe and}} compare the {{efficacy}} of intratympanic application of dexamethasone (DXM) {{for the treatment of}} refractory sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL), the DXM was given in three different ways: by tympanic membrane injection, by <b>drip</b> <b>through</b> a ventilation tube, and by perfusion through a round window catheter. Methods: We conducted a nonrandomized retrospective clinical trial involving 55 patients with refractory SSNHL. For 21 patients (the perfusion group), DXM (2. 5 mg/ 0. 5 ml) was perfused transtympanically through a round window catheter using an infusion pump for 1 h twice a day for 7 d giving a total amount of 35. 0 mg. For 23 patients (the injection group), DXM (2. 5 mg/time) was injected by tympanic membrane puncture at intervals of 2 d on a total of four occasions giving a total amount of 10. 0 mg. For 11 patients (the drip group), DXM (2. 5 mg/ 0. 5 ml) was dripped via a ventilation tube placed by myringotomy, once on the first day and twice a day for the remaining 6 d giving a total amount of 32. 5 mg. Thirty-two patients with refractory SSNHL who refused to undertake further treatments were defined as the control group. Hearing recovery and complications were compared among the groups. Hearing results were evaluated based on a four-frequency (0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, 4. 0 kHz) pure tone average (PTA). Results: Post-treatment audiograms were obtained one month after treatments were completed. The improvements in average PTA for the perfusion, injection, and drip groups were 9. 0, 8. 6, and 1. 7 dB, respectively. Hearing improvement was significantly greater in the perfusion and injection groups than in the control group (1. 4 dB) (P< 0. 05). In the perfusion group, 8 out of 21 patients (38. 1 %) had a PTA improvement of 15 ‒ 56 dB (mean 29. 8 dB); in the injection group, 8 out of 23 patients (34. 8 %) had a PTA improvement of 16 ‒ 54 dB (mean 24. 9 dB); in the drip group, 1 of 11 patients (9. 1 %) had a PTA improvement of 26. 0 dB; in the control group, 3 out of 32 patients (9. 4 %) had a PTA improvement of 15 ‒ 36 dB (mean 14. 9 dB). Conclusions: Topical intratympanic application of DXM is a safe and effective method for the treatment of SSNHL cases that are refractory to conventional therapies...|$|E

50|$|In a shot tower (now obsolete), {{molten metal}} (such as lead or steel), was <b>dripped</b> <b>through</b> a sieve into free fall. With {{sufficient}} height (several hundred feet), the metal would be solid enough to resist impact (usually {{in a water}} bath) {{at the bottom of}} the tower. While the shot may have been slightly deformed by its passage through the air and by impact at the bottom, this method produced metal spheres of sufficient roundness to be used directly in shotgun shells or to be refined by further processing for applications requiring higher accuracy.|$|R
5000|$|A suikinkutsu (literally [...] "water koto cave") {{is a type}} of Japanese garden {{ornament}} {{and music}} device. It consists of an upside down buried pot with a hole at the top. Water <b>drips</b> <b>through</b> the hole at the top onto a small pool of water inside of the pot, creating a pleasant splashing sound that rings inside of the pot similar to a bell or a Japanese zither called koto. It is usually built next to a traditional Japanese stone basin called chōzubachi, part of a tsukubai for washing hands before the Japanese tea ceremony.|$|R

5000|$|It {{consists}} of a bottom section filled with water, a filter section in the middle filled with finely ground coffee, and an upside-down pot placed on the top. When the water boils, the entire three-part coffee maker is flipped over to let the water filter through the coffee grounds. Once the water has <b>dripped</b> <b>through</b> the grounds, the water-boiling and filter sections are removed, and the coffee is served from the remaining pot. If coarse grounds are used, the coffee is brewed quite mildly. Using very finely ground coffee in the [...] "Neapolitan" [...] style, this method can produce a coffee that has a stronger flavor than an automatic drip brew maker.|$|R

Similar pasta of a rotund shape is called Knöpfle in Baden-Württemberg and in Bavarian Swabia. Spätzle are egg-based pasta made with fresh egg of an irregular form with a rough, porous surface. The glutinous dough is put directly into boiling water or steam and the form varies between thin and thick, elongated and short. They are the only pasta that is cooked for the first time during the fabrication.

Focusing on groundwater, two questions are proposed to unravel this double paradox: why is there increased pressure on groundwater resources despite the use of (purportedly) efficient drip irrigation? And why do actors continue to use the water saving argument for drip irrigation without ever measuring the claimed water conservation outcomes? These questions are illustrated through a case study in North Africa. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

KTS- 1 by adopting drip irrigation and fertigation practices at the Experimental Farm of Division of Olericulture, SKUAST-K, Shalimar, Srinagar (J&K) during rabi season of 2007. The treatments consisted of four levels of irrigation viz; 100 %, 80 % and 60 % ET <b>through</b> <b>drip</b> and 100 % surface irrigation; and four levels of fertilizers application viz; 100 %, 80 % and 60 % recommended NPK through fertigation and 100 % recommended NPK through traditional method of fertilizer application.

40|$|The {{first of}} the {{techniques}} to obtain palm wine consists of tapping the sap of a live palm through a cut {{at the base of}} the stem of the male flower, and collecting it in a calabash. This method causes little damage to the tree but requires a physical effort and technical skill. A man must climb the palm every morning and evening, with the help of a belt made from a piece of Iiana). The second technique requires cutting down the oil palm (generally a young one), and collecting the sap directly from a hole at the top. Every day, the cavity is enlarged and the sap <b>drips</b> <b>through</b> a small piece of bamboo into a calabash or jar. The two techniques are quite different from a sociological point of view, as in the case of other food products which can be used as cash crops. The first procedure, with its socially prescribed forms of consumption, reinforces lineage and marriage bonds as the personal qualities of the person providing the wine (such as strength and fidelity) are projected through the quality and quantity of the product. The second technique tends to erode traditional solidarity as the wine is usually sold and is thus consumed outside the kinship network. ln fact, the meaning and social bonds conveyed by a beverage, vary considerably from one culture to another...|$|R
