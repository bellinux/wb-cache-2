Make codes offer <b>defect</b> <b>acceptance</b> by marking information across multiple servers, whereas mistreatment less restore transfer than established removal codes throughout failure recovery. Therefore, {{we tend to}} study the matter of remotely checking the responsibleness of regenerating-coded information con to corruptions underneath a real-life cloud storage setting. we tend to style and implement a sensible information responsibleness security (DRS) theme for a particular make code, whereas conserving its integral properties of <b>defect</b> <b>acceptance</b> and repair-traffic saving.

40|$|This article {{outlines}} {{the structure of}} a generalized family of three-stage chain sampling plans, extending the concept of two-stage chain sampling plans of Dodge and Stephens (1966) which is an extension of the original work of Dodge (1955). Expressions are derived for the OC curves for several sets of general sets of three-stage chain sampling plans, with cumulative <b>acceptance</b> <b>numbers</b> of (c 1,c 2,c 3) = (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3), (0, 1, 4), (0, 2, 4), (0, 3, 4), (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 4) and (2, 3, 4). In the original work of Dodge (1955) only <b>acceptance</b> <b>numbers</b> of 0, 1 were used and in the extension work of Dodge and Stephens (1966) <b>acceptance</b> <b>numbers</b> of (c 1,c 2) = (0,l), (0, 2), (1, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (0, 4) and (1, 4) were used with selected sets of values of k 1 and k 2 (the number of lots considered for cumulation in the first and second stage respectively).

40|$|An {{approach}} {{used on the}} external tank (ET) portion of the Space Shuttle Program which employs fracture control to establish <b>defect</b> <b>acceptance</b> criteria in a welding specification is discussed.
