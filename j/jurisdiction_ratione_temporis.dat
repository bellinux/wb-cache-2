40|$|The {{interpretation}} of “continuing breaches” {{for the purposes}} of determining <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>ratione</b> <b>temporis</b> has taken on particular importance in the past several years. Most bilateral and multilateral treaty instruments include clauses that establish temporal limitations on jurisdiction, but they do not explicitly address “continuing breaches. ” Recently, NAFTA tribunals have considered this question under the three year time limitation of NAFTA Article 1116 (2), but the issue still remains largely unresolved. This paper will analyze “continuing breaches” in both investment law and general international law and conclude that “continuing breaches” are not valid exceptions to established time limitations in investment treaties. Section I will introduce policy considerations; Section II will analyze the specific language of Article 1116 (2) in accordance with the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (hereinafter VCLT); Section III will consider international law on <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>ratione</b> <b>temporis</b> and extinctive prescription more broadly, with particular focus on Article 14 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility and the concept of “continuing violations” in international law; Section IV will review the existing jurisprudence of the European and Inter-American human rights systems with respect to “continuing violations;” Section V will examine existing NAFTA jurisprudence that has considered this question; and Section VI will offer general conclusions and prudential considerations on <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>ratione</b> <b>temporis...</b>|$|E
40|$|This is a {{commentary}} on Article 11 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (<b>Jurisdiction</b> <b>ratione</b> <b>temporis).</b> The temporal parameters of the Court’s jurisdiction are restricted to crimes committed after its entry into force, which occurred on 1 July 2002. However, in terms of crimes that pre-date the Statute’s entry into force, but whose occurrence continues past 1 July 2002, the authors draw {{a fine line between}} two different categories of ‘continuing crimes’: (a) conduct where the actus reus is partly completed in the past, the effects of which continue to this day; (b) and conduct that constitutes an ongoing course of criminal activity, all of whose material elements continue to occur on a daily basis. The authors also examined the notion of ‘continuing crimes’ under human rights instruments particularly enforced or involuntary disappearances of persons as a serious violation of human rights and as a crime against humanity under the Rome Statute. Setting aside, the question of continuing crimes, the authors noted that international courts and tribunals have accepted the admission of evidence which pre-dates the applicable temporal jurisdiction for contextual purpose...|$|E

Despite differences courts tend to conceptualize common elements across the borders of different jurisdictional rules. The rule of non-retroactivity will find its application before different fora, but discrepancies will emerge with respect to concepts of continuous and composite acts which potentially may overcome temporal limitations.

40|$|In {{his effort}} to fashion a Christian prince in the Institutio principis Christiani, Erasmus, always the pedagogue, {{considers}} not only what the young ruler should read but how he should read it-that is, according to what interpretive method. The principal text on this reading list is the Bible, which, depending on the specific passage in question, bears reading {{in one of two}} ways: either allegorically or in the particularized light of a different time and place, what Erasmus refers to here as pro <b>ratione</b> <b>temporis</b> -after the standards of the time. While Erasmus does not on this occasion explain the similarities and differences between these two methods, elsewhere in his writings he elaborates upon their proper use and, {{especially in the case of}} allegory, their excesses. This essay, however, undertakes to explore only one of these two methods: interpretation pro <b>ratione</b> <b>temporis,</b> or what I have called Erasmian historicism. More precisely, I intend to show that, on the one hand, Erasmus distances this method from a rigid literalism that attends only to the words themselves, while, on the other hand, he identifies it repeatedly with the legal and rhetorical concept of equity. By doing so, he forges a method of interpretation that sets out to accomplish two seemingly contradictory tasks: it aims not only to preserve the original meaning of a text (as allegorical interpretation, according to its critics, fails to do) but also to accommodate a continually changing community of interpreters (as allegorical interpretation characteristically does). To fashion such a method, Erasmus looks back to the ancient rhetorical tradition, and more particularly, to its strategies of forensic debate. In keeping with these agonistic origins, moreover, Erasmian historicism serves as a powerful instrument of dissent...|$|R

40|$|To date, investor-state tribunals {{have been}} preoccupied {{with a range}} of issues {{revolving}} around the territorial application (territoriality) of international investment agreements (IIAs). The importance, as well as the various forms such issues take, has recently been highlighted in the decision of the Singapore High Court (SGHC) in Laos v. Sanum. In this case, the SGHC was asked by Laos to set aside an earlier arbitral award (in Sanum v. Laos), filed by a Macanese legal entity and rendered under the China-Laos bilateral investment treaty (BIT). In approaching the matter, the SGHC set aside the award {{on the grounds that the}} China-Laos BIT did not extend to Macao. This decision has provoked mixed feelings, as it may weigh heavily against the territorial application of Chinese IIAs to Hong Kong and Macao. At the same time, from an academic perspective, the decision provides an opportunity to delve deeper into the territorial elements inherent to <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>ratione</b> personae as this pertains to international investment law. Within this setting, this article seeks to provide a conceptual framework for analyzing future investor-state arbitration disputes under IIAs where similar territorial application issues may arise. This article is nevertheless limited to issues of <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>ratione</b> personae. Therefore, the territorial nexus of investments, particularly as it pertains to cases involving sovereign bonds, is not addressed in this article. In addition, this article does not intend to address territorial issues connected to the so-called nationality planning and treaty shopping techniques as well as the various approaches followed in piercing the corporate veil of foreign investors.

25|$|Drake v New Zealand is a {{case that}} was decided by the Committee in 1997. Drake had been a {{prisoner}} of war in Japan during World War Two and made an individual complaint to the Committee about the actions of the New Zealand Government concerning prisoners of war following the war. One complaint was about the Treaty of San Francisco entered into between the Allies and Japan as Drake felt that his right to a remedy had been removed as a consequence {{of not being able to}} seek reparation from Japan. In addition to this, in 1988 the New Zealand Government issued reparations for those who were prisoners of war in Germany during World War Two and not those in Japan, which Drake alleged was discrimination. In both complaints the events themselves occurred before New Zealand was a party to the First Optional Protocol and so was inadmissible <b>ratione</b> <b>temporis.</b> Even if this were not the case, the claim would have been unsubstantiated as the alleged discrimination was not on any of the listed categories of discrimination of the ICCPR and therefore not within the jurisdiction of the Committee.|$|R
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on one {{particular}} factor that is of crucial importance to all self-defence actions. It is a factor that is almost always present in the application and appraisal of the right, but one that is not always explicitly engaged with: time. There are various <b>ratione</b> <b>temporis</b> elements underpinning the lawful exercise {{of the right of}} self-defence, and questions related to the timing of both an attack being responded to in self-defence and the response itself are notably controversial. The self-defence timeline is therefore charted, and the key legal debates encountered along its trajectory are identified. In particular, there is a focus on three temporal ‘stages’ of the right of self-defence: (i) the much-debated question of preventative forms of self-defence (the ‘before’); (ii) the timeliness of a state's defensive action, or what is sometimes called the need for the response to be ‘immediate’ (the ‘during’); and (iii) the duration of self-defence actions, including the crucial issue of when they must end (the ‘after’). The aim of this article is not to break new substantive ground with regard to these ‘stages’ as such, but is, rather, to draw together the temporal strands of self-defence in a more focused manner than is often the case in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Opportunities {{may arise}} to arrest a ship in {{maritime}} zones beyond internal waters, e. g. in the territorial {{sea and the}} exclusive economic zone (EEZ). This paper examines the possibilities for arrest in those areas {{on the basis of}} <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>ratione</b> loci and ratione materiae. Under Belgian law the territorial sea {{is not part of the}} State's territory; accordingly, the Belgian Judicial Code does not provide for an attachment judge nor a bailiff to have jurisdiction in this area and a fortiori in the EEZ. The law of April 22, 1999 solved the problem of territorial jurisdiction in this respect. As far as a ship's arrest in the EEZ is concerned, it is not clear whether the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention (articles 73 and 220) combined with the requirement of a maritime claim, allows for an arrest at all.

40|$|Host state counterclaims in {{investment}} treaty arbitration are rarely pleaded and never successful, {{to the extent}} that one commentator has characterised their use as ‘thirty years of failure’. This paper navigates the obstacles that host states must contend with to assert counterclaims {{in investment}} treaty arbitration. While state counterclaims are permitted in principle under the ICSID Convention and UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, satisfaction of the jurisdiction and admissibility requirements has proved more complex. The paper examines a number of core treaty provisions to identify the treaties that may be more or less likely to extend a tribunal’s <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>ratione</b> materiae over state counterclaims. Subsequently, this paper examines the requisite connection that must exist between a counterclaim and the principal claim. A survey of international jurisprudence supports the conclusion of this paper that recent treaty tribunal decisions have taken an unjustifiably narrow and often inconsistent approach to requisite connection, {{to the extent that}} it may be virtually impossible for states to assert counterclaims under its current articulation.

The Statute of the ICTY is not and does not purport to be a meticulously detailed code providing for every possible scenario and every solution thereto. It sets out in somewhat general terms the jurisdictional framework within which the Tribunal has been mandated to operate. The list in Article 7(1) appears to be non-exhaustive in nature as the use of the phrase 'or otherwise aided and abetted' suggests.:The nature of joint criminal enterprise: insofar as a participant shares the purpose of the joint criminal enterprise (as he or she must do) as opposed to merely knowing about it, he or she cannot be regarded as a mere aider and abettor to the crime which is contemplated.

50|$|Applications by {{individuals}} against contracting states, {{alleging that the}} state violates their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights, {{can be made by}} any person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals. Although the official languages of the Court are English and French, applications may be submitted in any one of the official languages of the contracting states. An application has to be made in writing and signed by the applicant or by the applicant's representative. Once registered with the Court, the case is assigned to a judge rapporteur, who can make a final decision that the case is inadmissible. A case may be inadmissible when it is incompatible with the requirements of <b>ratione</b> materiae, <b>ratione</b> <b>temporis</b> or <b>ratione</b> personae, or if the case cannot be proceeded with on formal grounds, such as non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, lapse of the six months from the last internal decision complained of, anonymity, substantial identity with a matter already submitted to the Court, or with another procedure of international investigation. If the rapporteur judge decides that the case can proceed, the case is referred to a Chamber of the Court which, unless it decides that the application is inadmissible, communicates the case to the government of the state against which the application is made, asking the government to present its observations on the case. The Chamber of the Court then deliberates and judges the case on its admissibility and its merits. Cases that raise serious questions of interpretation and application of the European Convention on Human Rights, a serious issue of general importance, or which may depart from previous case law can be heard in the Grand Chamber if all parties to the case agree to the Chamber of the Court relinquishing jurisdiction to the Grand Chamber. A panel of five judges decides whether the Grand Chamber accepts the referral.|$|R
40|$|AbstractReasoning {{refers to}} the {{application}} of the rule, once interpreted, to the facts of the cause established by the Court and to the deduction of the conclusion of an infringement or non-infringement – in the respective case – of the rule invoked. The order of the examination of the questions – classical according to the opinion of a French judge – is the following: the competence of the Court, the admission of the petition, a good substantiation of the demand. The competence can be denied for incompatibility ratione materiae, if the litigation is outside the material domain of application of the Convention, ratione personae, if the defendant State {{is not part of the}} Convention or if the defendant is not the State or State-related; finally, <b>ratione</b> <b>temporis,</b> if the defendant State did not ratify the Convention or the pertinent protocol at the date when the facts were committed. The issue of the incompetence ratione loci is out of the question. Certainly, we can mention that renunciation exists and it triggers the disappearance of the case from the Court's roll; yet, the priority of this situation over that of incompetence is not solved as clearly as via the French administrative jurisprudence. Actually, the competence-related issues are dealt with by the Convention organs, the Commission and then the Court, as admission issues, which the State solves with the help of some preliminary exceptions or which the Court solves ex officio. Finally, it is essential that the European Court of Human Rights must defend the persons against the abusive violation of their rights by States, without condemning them systematically and a priori. And after 50 years of jurisprudence, we consider that, neither systematic, nor dogmatic, the reasoning of the Court of Human Rights, Strasbourg tends to evolve towards a pragmatic syncretism, which seems to us to be an acceptable possible approach...|$|R

More important, the jurisprudence in the M/V “Louisa” Case is now relied by the ITLOS as evidenced in the M/V “Virginia G” Case, while completed with more explicit pronunciations about the burden and standard of proof on the existence of and abuse of rights under Article 300, necessarily in connection with the exercise of the rights, jurisdiction and freedoms recognized by the UNCLOS...|$|R

In the Judgment on preliminary objections of 2016, relating to the “new” case Question of the Delimitation of the Continental Shelf between Nicaragua and Colombia beyond 200 nautical miles from the Nicaraguan Coast, the ICJ held that no binding force attached to the operative part of the 2012 ruling. The outcome of the incidental proceedings was not predictable as one might have expected, given that the decision was taken with the casting vote of the President and prompted a strong dissent among some judges. This occurrence gives a clear evidence on the interplay between several intertwined issues of international law, which the majority was called to deal with and balance in the present case, such as the interpretation of Article 76, paragraph 8 of the UNCLOS, the principles of res judicata and <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>ratione</b> materiae and the duty to give reasons.

40|$|Supervisor: Prof. Marise CremonaAward date: 1 September 2012 The {{main subject}} of the thesis focuses {{on the concept of}} {{jurisdiction}} and its limits, with special attention put to the Court of Justice of the European Union. The first half of the work delivers the broad theoretical approach concerning types of jurisdictions and the notion of forum shopping. As far as the Court of Justice of the European Union is concerned, not only it describes its <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>ratione</b> personae, ratione materiae, and defines its exclusivity, especially in the dimension of external relations of the EU, but it also presents the possible conflicting or complementary judicial regimes. Thus, the most important stress is given to the problem of overlapping jurisdiction in the context of international relations of the EU and the principle of the autonomy of the EU legal order. The second half of the work is dedicated to the practical example of the mixed agreement -United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea - which has particular effects on the area of the competences of the EU and on the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court. The Swordfish dispute and the MOX Plant dispute, taken as examples, bring relevant input, especially to the case of jurisdictional conflicts in front of mixed agreements. To sum-up, the thesis contributes to the delineation of the jurisdictional competence of the European Court of Justice as a mechanism that functions in very autonomous legal regime of the European Union...|$|R

The contract conditions provide for arbitration of disputes and parties to a contract may choose {{to submit to the}} International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) which was established by members of the World Bank for the settlement of investment disputes between states and nationals of other states. The objectives of the Thesis are to (i) examine the legality of generally submitting disputes in international civil engineering contracts to ICSID arbitration, (ii) provide an analysis of ICSID as an international arbitral institution and (iii) discuss the legal aspects of submission of disputes to ICSID arbitration in breach of the Convention that established ICSID. Chapters One, Two and Three are devoted to describing the importance of civil engineering works to economic growth and arbitration as a method of resolution of disputes. An analysis is made of the fundamentals and complexity of the arbitral process and the interfacing between legal systems, national laws and international law in international arbitrations. Chapter Four traces the genesis of ICSID and Chapter Five examines critically the salient features of ICSID arbitration, which according to the Thesis are not all exclusive to ICSID arbitration. Chapters Six and Seven analyse in depth ICSID <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>ratione</b> personae and ratione materiae. Chapter Eight argues that disputes in freestanding international civil engineering contracts are not investment disputes and that submission to ICSID is in breach of the Convention.

40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} the {{projected}} Arab Court of Justice (ACJ) as a regional court, expected to be created within the League of Arab States system. Chapter one deals mainly with {{the basic structure of}} the League of Arab States itself, its membership, its organs, the settlement of disputes, and the reasons that are delaying the creation of the ACJ and the role it will be expected to play in settling inter-Arab disputes. In the second chapter comprehensive information on the function of the judicial power in Islamic Shariah is presented, including the status of judges in Islam, their appointment, qualifications, independence and other issues related to them. Chapter three concentrates on the organisation of the projected ACJ, comparing its draft Statute with the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and other regional international courts. The chapter will also show how far the Arab draftsmen have been influenced by principles and rules of Islamic Shariah, especially in matters relating to the qualification of judges. Furthermore, the chapter will discuss other points related to the organisation of the bench such as nomination of candidates, system of election, constituting chambers, appointing ad hoc judges etc. The fourth chapter explains in detail at the level of theory as well as of practice the role of Islamic Shariah as a source to be applied by the projected ACJ. The chapter points to the need to discuss the origins and fundamental conceptions of Islamic Shariah as a law capable to be applied by the projected ACJ. Chapter five continues with a discussion of the jurisdiction of the ACJ, and makes detailed reference to the concepts of <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>ratione</b> personae, ratione materiae and the function of the ACJ to give advisory opinions.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the Statutes, procedures and functions of the principal existing international administrative tribunals is aimed to propose a reconstruction of the comprehensive judicial protection granted to international officials in staff disputes with organizations {{in the context of}} contemporary international legal order, evaluating the adequacy of staff disputes resolutions systems to human rights’ standards and the effectiveness {{of the rule of law}} in the internal activity of international organizations. The work explores the reasons underlying the institution of administrative tribunals in international organizations from the dominant opinion of jurisdictional immunity and protection of independence of international organisations to the current trend, expressed in internal and international case-law, which recognizes judicial immunity of international organizations before national courts only in the case of the previous setting of judicial bodies with adequate procedural standards, also trying to explain the phenomenon of the so called proliferation of administrative tribunals. A detailed analysis is dedicated to the International Labour Organization Administrative Tribunal (ILOAT), court whose jurisdiction to solve staff disputes is recognized by the majority of existing international organization and which is still considered the exemplary international administrative jurisdiction. The exam is specially focused to his <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>ratione</b> personae and ratione materiae and to the possible submission of a request of advisory proceedings before the International Court of Justice, taking into account the relevant cases in the field. The model jurisdiction is then compared to the new two-tier staff disputes system established in the framework of United Nations (UN Dispute Tribunal and UN Appeals Tribunal) and examined in its first years of activity. Furthermore, the thesis illustrates the special features and the evolution of the staff disputes system of European Union, based since 2004 on the jurisdiction at first instance of the EU Civil Service Tribunal, also examining the possible three levels articulation of the system thanks to the review procedure of General Court decisions before the Court of Justice. The analysis and the comparison with the tradition of administrative tribunals reveal the actual position of staff disputes in the framework of the judicial architecture established by EU Treaties. Finally, also statutes and functions of the administrative tribunals of World Bank and International Monetary Fund have been examined. The exam of statutory rules and procedures of the tribunals analysed and their application in recent case law reveal critical issues still characterizing the functioning of administrative tribunals, above all the search for independence from both staff and organization, the procedure of choosing international administrative judges, the existence of a right of appeal against decisions of tribunals in a limited number of administrative tribunals, the problem of judicial protection of all subjects not officially included in the staff of international organization, all aspects considered in the context of accountability and respect of due process by contemporary international organizations...|$|R
40|$|It is now {{a common}} feature of {{international}} investment treaties to provide for investor-State arbitration to be initiated unilaterally by foreign investors. It is a much-anticipated and effective procedure {{for the protection of}} investors. At the same time, it brings advantages to recipient States as well in that they embody assurance for protection and thus encourage investments. However, as investors have been more active in their use of this arbitration procedure, recipient States have become increasingly concerned that an excessive burden has been placed upon them. These concerns include the fear that investor-State arbitration proceedings may improperly prevent the implementation of domestic policies, and that they may be abused by multiple usage of national/international procedures with regard to substantially "identical" facts, even though claimants in each procedure are different entities from a formal point of view. This paper evaluates these concerns {{from the perspective of the}} conditions surrounding the submission of claims to investor-State arbitration. When faced with a unilateral commencement of arbitral procedure, respondent States usually object to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal by alleging that some conditions are lacking, such as (1) the existence of legal disputes, (2) <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>ratione</b> temporae, (3) exhaustion of prior consultation, and (4) jus standi. Despite emphatic calls for consideration of sovereignty on the part of respondent States as a presumed limitation to competence, arbitral tribunals generally adopt literal interpretation of international investment agreements and rules of arbitration procedures. Investors' right to sue is explicitly provided by States concerned in the text, whereas deference to sovereignty is not. It is inappropriate to claim from these past judgments that by placing too much emphasis on the need for protection of investments, arbitral tribunals tend to bend their interpretation of treaties in investors' favor. Nevertheless, we can point out at least one problem: they haven't paid much attention to the distinction between two different questions, i. e., their jurisdiction and admissibility of claim. They generally tend to treat issues concerning submission to arbitration solely as those regarding the arbitration agreement and, as such, related to the jurisdiction of tribunals. However, questions such as jus standi are issues pertaining to the appropriateness of submission of claims, which are questions of admissibility that cannot be reduced entirely to the interpretation of a "constructed" agreement between investors and the recipient State. Rather, they are concerned with the circumstances relating to the commencement of an arbitration proceeding, and they are not to be treated as something included in an "agreement" simply because the comprehensive consent of recipient States to investment arbitration is given in advance through treaty provisions. If there are justifiable grounds for concern or feelings of distrust on the part of recipient States involved in the active use of arbitration proceedings, they can be traced to the fact that arbitral tribunals tend to misunderstand pleas from respondent States on grounds of inappropriateness of submission in specific circumstances to mean that a submission of claims exceeds the reach of their consent given in treaties. One of the reasons for this attitude among arbitral tribunals lies in the dogma of party autonomy: operation of arbitral proceedings are to be based on agreement between the parties concerned, so they seek to base and explain their judgment exclusively in terms of "agreement," which is constructed by juncture of an offer on the part of recipient States set out in a treaty and an acceptance on the part of an investor by way of submission of claim. But, in view of past judgments, it is worthwhile to consider providing arbitral tribunals explicitly with competence to handle questions of admissibility as distinct from those of jurisdiction. From this point of view, it is of great significance that the ICSID rules of proceeding for arbitration were revised in 2006 in order for arbitral tribunals to deal with the objection to a claim that is "manifestly without legal merit. " Its future application should be watched closely. ...|$|R
40|$|In 2013 the OECD {{launched}} an unprecedented initiative {{in the field}} of international taxation focusing its activity and attention on a new emerging global issue: the erosion of the taxable bases in qualified tax jurisdiction, and the subsequent shifting of profits in fa-vour of others. This (apparently) new phenomenon is originated by the possibility given to the busi-nesses in general (and to MNEs – Multi National Enterprises - in particular) {{to make the most of}} domestic rules and of Double Taxation Conventions in order to allocate the prof-its they make in the most favourable jurisdiction. This strategy should not be confused with tax evasion or avoidance. The two latter situations are currently tackled by specific provisions in different tax systems ranging from tailor-made provisions to GAARs (- General Anti Avoidance Rules - where applicable) to the Abuse of Law doctrine. Base erosion, on the other hand, is a broader phenomenon: it occurs when a business scheme leads to remarkable savings in taxation via the proper application of domestic rules or DTCs (Double Taxation Conventions). In this respect, Academic literature has been warning policy makers and stakeholders from the risks of possible double non-taxation induced by the overlap of DTCs with domestic rules that has ben changed trough years. Traditionally, the OECD intervention in this respect has always maintained one prior-ity: the prevention of (international) double taxation via bilateral instruments (Treaties) inspired by the Model delivered and interpreted consistently with the Commentary also drafted by the OECD itself. The explosion of the global financial crisis and the subsequent increased need for an ever increasing amount of tax revenue by many States belonging to the OECD created however the most appropriate momentum for a change of perspectives. Following the historical momentum, OECD urged for the necessity of a shift of para-digm in international taxation: time has (allegedly) come for a move from the prevention of double taxation to the implementation of an actual taxation of MNEs and cross border profits. In this respect, DTCs, the Model and the Soft law should be interpreted in a way to make actual taxation of cross border income as a certain result, preventing therefore double non-taxation. Ambitious and bold as it is, the BEPS initiative started in 2013 with a number of doc-uments and some as 15 separate actions addressing specific and qualified situations orig-inating base erosion in respective tax jurisdictions: the issue of tax coordination and dou-ble deductions are two of them, with the first being actually a remedy (also) to the sec-ond. Double deduction occurs in cases in which a cost may be deducted in both tax juris-dictions by the same legal entity (a company or a group of companies, if group relief is allowed and the group of company is considered as a legal entity) thus determining and illogic, unfair and ultimately unacceptable reduction of the overall burden. The OECD Report in this respect lists a remarkable number of different cases and sit-uations in which this outcome may be achieved by the taxpayer, without falling into any case of avoidance or abuse. Despite the considerable technical differences, with a rea-sonable margin of appreciation it could be concluded that most of them are determined by legal mismatches of qualification between the two legal jurisdictions and concerning either the flow of income or the legal entity of the case. In this respect asymmetries may concern a legal entity qualified as transparent by a jurisdiction and not by the other, or a specific income considered as an interest paid in the source State (thus deductible for tax purposes) and as dividend in the residence State (thus enjoying a full – or partial – exemption from taxation. Similar asymmetries may also concern the notion of PE (Permanent Establishment) and the ways and means to tax profits attributable to it in the different tax jurisdictions: on the top of that, the existence (or not) of the PE in the view of the two different tax ju-risdictions may also lead to double non-taxation or double deduction of costs. Action n. 2 of the BEPS Report (on Double deductions) describes in details the differ-ent situations listed above and further ways and many o reach the same result without falling into a case of Abuse of law or tax avoidance, with some of the situations depicted that may also potentially be of some interest for the Italian legal system. As a matter of fact, in a recent past, the Italian Supreme Court decided some cases in a way to open a remarkable leeway for base erosion (or profit shifting) by the taxpayer, interpreting a DTC in a way which was perhaps not entirely consistent with the OECD guidelines applicable <b>ratione</b> <b>temporis.</b> The new BEPS initiative should help to prevent from other decisions to be taken in the same direction. While discussion on the BEPS rages on in every OECD Country (and beyond) the case of Italy is however peculiar for purely domestic reasons as well. The Italian Parliament approved very recently an Act (n° 23 passed in 2014) empow-ering the Government to reform the fiscal system making in more simple, accessible, less burdensome for the taxpayer. In this respect it also provided specific guidelines to be re-spected by the Government in its future regulatory activity (with a quasi-legislative effect). It’s noteworthy to read at Article 12 of the aforementioned Act that the Government will have to draft the future decrees “… consistently with the recommendations by supra-national organizations …”. Reference is made of course (and first of all) to the EU soft law, but there’s no literal or legal element excluding the BEPS initiative from that refer-ence. This would arguably be the first case in the recent tax history of the Country in which such a large reference is made to non domestic guidelines by the Italian Parlia-ment, allowing the Government to transform policy guidelines and soft law into legally binding provisions of the Italian law. Even if it’s still too early at this stage to assess whether the Government shall pick the opportunity and make use of this possibility or not, nonetheless it remains in line of prin-ciple the relevance of the opportunity, the impact of the OECD-inspired global order and, eventually, the attempt of making a sort of lex mercatoria fisci which has still to be however drafted in details...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{research}} is “South Africa’s Voluntary Relinquishment of its Nuclear Arsenal and Accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in Terms of International Law”. The research found that international law considerations did indeed {{play an important role in}} guiding South Africa’s relinquishment of its nuclear arsenal, and in accession to the NPT. The dissertation was conducted by interviewing an expert sample of the key persons who were actually involved with, and led, South Africa’s relinquishment of its nuclear arsenal and accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The decision to interview the expert respondents was followed in order to understand the respondents’ animus or state of mind, and the logos of the decision to relinquish the nuclear weapons and accede to the NPT. The study sample included: • Mr FW de Klerk, former President of South Africa, who instructed that the nuclear arsenal should be relinquished, and that South Africa should accede to the NPT; • Professor Wynand Mouton, whom Mr de Klerk appointed as the Oversight Auditor of South Africa’s nuclear relinquishment and its accession to the NPT; • Professor Waldo Stumpf, who successfully project-managed the nuclear relinquishment process, and brought accession to the NPT into reality; • Mr Pik Botha, who was South Africa’s longest-serving Minister of Foreign Affairs, and who later held the portfolio of Minister of Energy. Mr Botha was personally involved in leading many important international negotiations that pertained to South Africa’s nuclear status over some decades; and • Dr Neil Barnard, who was Director of South Africa’s National Intelligence Service at the time. An important and new research finding was that all of the respondents indicated that the reason the nuclear weapons were relinquished and South Africa acceded to the NPT was that the relinquishment of these weapons and the accession to the NPT were symbiotically interconnected with the constitutional settlement in South Africa. For the respondents, it was a causa sine qua non of the international acceptance and recognition of South Africa’s non-racial constitutional settlement. The respondents were ad idem that it would have been well-nigh impossible to have achieved a peaceful constitutional settlement which was internationally 5 legitimate without relinquishing these weapons and acceding to the NPT prior to the conclusion of the constitutional negotiations. Had South Africa held onto this nuclear arsenal, it would have created international mistrust, because it would have begged the question (petitio principii) : “What is the purpose of their retention?” The perpetuation of the nuclear weapons programme would have created international doubt as to the sincerity of the constitutional transition and contributed to the continued recognition of South Africa as a pariah state. This finding has not been reported in the literature and is therefore a new contribution to knowledge about South Africa’s constitutional transition. Although not publicly visible, the relinquishment of the nuclear arsenal and South Africa’s accession to the NPT were purposively linked, and indeed synchronised, with the constantly changing status of the constitutional negotiations – <b>ratione</b> <b>temporis.</b> The link between the relinquishment of the nuclear arsenal and the accession to the NPT was purposefully kept secret. This was because it was reasoned that the matter of South Africa’s design of a nuclear arsenal, its possession of these weapons, its dismantlement of these weapons, and its accession to the NPT formed such a potentially contentious matter, both nationally and internationally, that it could easily have thrust the entire constitutional transition into jeopardy. For this reason it was decided (wisely, in the researcher’s view) to address the matter of relinquishment and accession to the NPT in camera. It was conducted in camera because the security of the state was at stake. The testimony of the respondents made it clear that this subject was sufficiently incendiary to have derailed the constitutional negotiations and settlement, and plunged the country into chaos. The research discovered that the reason the decision was reached to relinquish the nuclear arsenal and accede to the NPT was to ensure that South Africa was recognised as a constitutional democracy and a respected member of the international community of nations. The mission was conducted in order to achieve state succession in a stable framework of constitutional continuity. The research also discovered that a number of the countries that have relinquished their nuclear weapons and acceded to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons did so because of the imperative to create a positive state recognition status amongst the international community. Had South Africa retained the nuclear arsenal during the constitutional negotiations, and afterwards, it would have tainted and jeopardised the state succession and the constitutional continuity of the country. It would have endowed the government-in-waiting with a poisoned chalice and undermined Mr Mandela’s stature as a leader. The decision was made by Mr de Klerk and conducted in good faith insofar as all stakeholders were concerned. Comity was displayed by the National Party towards the African National Congress – the regime-in-waiting – in order to endow it with the opportunity of becoming a successful government. The research found that Mr de Klerk, together with his team, carefully reconciled and harmonised South African municipal law with international law in order to obviate a conflict of laws. This harmonisation of law was important in establishing respectful relationships and comity with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is an organ imbued with international legal personality under the United Nations Charter, and with the international inspectors, including those from inter alia the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, China and France. The expert respondents were all in consensus that South Africa could never have lawfully deployed the nuclear weapons in any conceivable military conflict, including in the case where the very existence of the South African State might have been at risk. They unanimously expressed the opinion that such usage would have constituted a mala in se and been contrary to natural law and peremptory norms of humanity. The principles of jus cogens and erga omnes permeated their assessment of the legality of any usage of nuclear weapons. The respondents were also in agreement that any actual use of these weapons would be disproportionate, indiscriminate, escalatory, and would not be able to discern friend from foe, and therefore would be contrary to international humanitarian law. The usage of a nuclear bomb would have been a threat to world peace in terms of the United Nations Charter, which might have justified a United Nations-sanctioned military invasion of South Africa to counteract such a threat to world peace, as was the case when Iraq invaded Kuwait. The interviewees were in consensus that if the nuclear weapons had been deployed, they would have escalated conflict, and created an international reprisal risk with potentially disastrous consequences for South Africa, the region, and indeed for the world at large. The research sample further indicated that any operational use of these nuclear weapons would have created disproportional consequences, which would, by deduction, have contravened inter alia: the Geneva Conventions, the Hague Regulations Conventions, the Kellogg–Briand Pact (1928), the Martens Clause, and therefore international humanitarian law. It would have raised the question of state responsibility for wrongful actions, which would also have included contraventions of international environmental law caused by trans-boundary nuclear pollution. Individuals committing wrongful actions could not have pleaded immunity from such wrongfulness by claiming immunity under South African municipal law. The respondents subscribed to a positive law interpretation of the legality of nuclear deterrence, which is the position that the Nuclear Weapons States have assumed. In its essence, this positive law view subscribes to the principle contained in the Lotus case, that what is not prohibited ispermitted. Natural law and positive law have oppositional reasoning as regards the legality of nuclear weapons, and this logical tension was evident in the research. The respondents revealed a difference of opinion as far as their understanding of the legality of the development, possession, testing and deterrence versus actual usage of nuclear weapons is concerned. They were of the view that any military usage or nuclear test would be illegal, but regarded the development, possession and deterrent usage of nuclear weapons as being lawful. The relinquishment process and accession to the NPT was conducted as a secret set of negotiations contiguous with the constitutional negotiations. It is a fact that the African National Congress was not informed about these negotiations until Mr de Klerk issued his formal announcement about the relinquishment and accession to the NPT on 23 March 1993. Mr Mandela was therefore presented with the reality of relinquishment and accession as a fait accompli. South Africa’s rollback is compared with the relinquishment process in Iraq in an attempt to discover whether insight and knowledge from the South African case might be transferred and applied to other countries that are contemplating the same actions. The provisional answer to this question is that partial aspects of the knowledge that was created in South Africa might possibly constitute elements of precedent. The application and transference of this knowledge would always need to be tailored to the unique context, facts and circumstances that might prevail in the transferee state in question. Most certainly all nuclear relinquishment and accession processes need to be conducted as extremely serious projects and in good faith...|$|R
