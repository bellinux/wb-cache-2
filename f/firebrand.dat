5|$|Simon & Schuster {{released}} The <b>Firebrand</b> on October 1, 1987 in hardcover, and it {{was issued}} in paperback in September 1988. The <b>Firebrand</b> has been overshadowed by the popularity of The Mists of Avalon, receiving less attention and critical praise. Reviews of the book ranged from mixed to positive, with many literary critics praising Bradley's ability to give new characterizations to legendary figures. It has been translated into at least twelve languages, beginning with Portuguese and French in 1989.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Firebrand</b> is an 1987 {{historical}} fantasy {{novel by}} American author Marion Zimmer Bradley. Set {{in the ancient}} city of Troy, the novel is a re-telling of Homer's epic poem, the Iliad. The <b>Firebrand</b> is written {{from the point of}} view of Kassandra, the prophet daughter of King Priam of Troy, and also features other prominent characters from Greek mythology. As in the Iliad, Kassandra foresees catastrophe for her city but few pay heed to her warnings. In Bradley's story, Kassandra is presented as a strong and insightful woman, rather than as a sufferer of insanity.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} tests were {{conducted}} under laboratory conditions to assess, on the one hand, the capacity of several fuel beds to be ignited by <b>firebrands</b> and to sustain a fire and, on the other hand, the capability {{of different types of}} <b>firebrands</b> to ignite fuel beds,. Fuel beds and <b>firebrands</b> were selected amongst the most common in Southern Europe. Regarding fuel bed flammability, results show that grasses are more flammable than litters and, amongst litters, Pinus species are the most flammable. The increase of bulk density and FMC involves an increase of the time-to-ignition, and a decrease of the other flammability parameters. The capability of <b>firebrands</b> to ignite fuel beds is higher when the <b>firebrands</b> drop in flaming phase and with no air flow than in glowing phase with air flow. Logistic regression models to predict fuel bed ignition probability were developed. As a whole, results show a relationship between ignition probability of fuel bed and type or weight of <b>firebrands.</b> Pinus pinaster cone scale, Pinus halepensis cone scale, Eucalyptus globulus leaf and bark can have ignition probabilities at least twice higher than bark of Pines when fallen in flaming combustion...|$|R

5|$|The <b>Firebrand</b> {{required}} significant {{effort by}} Blackburn {{to produce a}} useful aircraft and the first discussions on a redesign of the aircraft with a laminar-flow wing took place in September 1943. The new wing was estimated to reduce {{the weight of the}} wing by 700lb (318kg) and increase the aircraft speed by 13mph (21km/h). The extent of redesign increased and this led to a new fuselage and other improvements. In October 1943, Blackburn's design staff, led by G.E. Petty, started work on this development of the <b>Firebrand</b> which led to Specification S.28/43 being issued by the Air Ministry on 26 February 1944 covering the new aircraft. The specification was designed around a Bristol Centaurus 77 radial engine with contra-rotating propellers that allowed the size of the rudder to be reduced.|$|E
5|$|The third {{prototype}} {{made its}} maiden flight in early 1948, but {{the pace of}} the flight testing was leisurely with only 7 hours and 40 minutes completed by 30 November, over half of which were connected with air show performances. Testing concluded in March 1949 when the officer in charge concluded that there was no further purpose to the tests. While the Firecrest was faster than the <b>Firebrand,</b> and gave its pilot a much better view from the cockpit, it was otherwise disappointing, with test pilot and naval aviator Captain Eric Brown claiming that the Firecrest was even less manoeuvrable than the sluggish <b>Firebrand,</b> while the powered ailerons gave lumpy controls, leading to instability in turbulent air.|$|E
5000|$|Wildfires {{may also}} spread by jumping or {{spotting}} as winds and vertical convection columns carry <b>firebrands</b> (hot wood embers) and other burning materials {{through the air}} over roads, rivers, and other barriers that may otherwise act as firebreaks. Torching and fires in tree canopies encourage spotting, and dry ground fuels that surround a wildfire are especially vulnerable to ignition from <b>firebrands.</b> Spotting can create spot fires as hot embers and <b>firebrands</b> ignite fuels downwind from the fire. In Australian bushfires, spot fires are known to occur as far as 10 km from the fire front. [...] Since the mid-1980s, earlier snowmelt and associated warming has also been associated {{with an increase in}} length and severity of the wildfire season in the Western United States.|$|R

5|$|DC often still draws {{criticism}} {{for its use}} of stereotypes for LGBT characters. <b>Firebrand,</b> a superhero debuting in 1941, is thought {{by some to be}} an early example, with his pink or transparent costume. Writer Roy Thomas penned thought balloons that suggested <b>Firebrand</b> had been involved in a gay relationship with his sidekick and bodyguard Slugger Dunn, although these hints never moved beyond subtext. A more modern example is the violent vigilante superhero Midnighter. The Batman-like Midnighter was shown as being in a relationship with the Superman-like Apollo during their time as members of the superhero team The Authority. Midnighter and Apollo are now married and have an adopted daughter– Midnighter has gone on to star in his own title. In 2006, DC Comics could still draw widespread media attention by announcing a new, lesbian incarnation of the well-known character Batwoman, even though openly lesbian minor characters such as Gotham City police officer Renee Montoya already existed in the franchise.|$|E
5|$|Marion Zimmer Bradley's The <b>Firebrand</b> {{features}} an even younger Troilus, just twelve when he becomes Hector's charioteer. (His brother {{wants to keep}} a protective eye on him now he is ready for war.) Troilus helps kill Patroclus. Although he manages to escape {{the immediate aftermath of}} Hector's death, he is wounded. After the Trojans witness Achilles' treatment of Hector's body, Troilus insists on rejoining the battle despite his wounds and Hecuba's attempts to stop him. Achilles kills him with an arrow. The mourning Hecuba comments {{that he did not want}} to live because he blamed himself for Hector's death.|$|E
5|$|The lavish banquet {{was certain}} to be an affront to those {{suffering}} {{in a time of}} severe austerity, but it was reported in the L'Ami du peuple and other <b>firebrand</b> newspapers as nothing short of a gluttonous orgy. Worst of all, the papers all dwelt scornfully on the reputed desecration of the tricolor cockade; drunken officers were said to have stamped upon this symbol of the nation and professed their allegiance solely to the white cockade of the House of Bourbon. This embellished tale of the royal banquet became the source of intense public outrage.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{possibility}} {{of using a}} reduced-scale model based on the Froude-scaling technique to study the transport of spherical, cylindrical and disk-shaped <b>firebrands</b> by a wind-blown plume was investigated theoretically. The cases of hot particles produced by arcing copper power lines and burning sparks produced by arcing aluminium power lines were also considered. In each case, scaling relationships were derived for mass, linear-momentum, angular momentum and energy transport equations of the <b>firebrands,</b> using well-established models. The analysis shows that, {{in the case of}} cylindrical <b>firebrands,</b> incompatible conditions on brand diameter are obtained to scale both the linear-momentum equation and the mass and energy equations. It also shows that all physical processes scale correctly for hot copper particles as well as spherical and disk-shaped burning embers {{with the exception of the}} conservation of angular momentum in the case of disks. Despite this drawback, numerical results, obtained using an integral model representing a wind-blown plume, show that the mass and spatial distributions for both types of <b>firebrands</b> can be satisfactorily reproduced down to a scale of 1 : 5.

5|$|The novel {{has been}} {{described}} as belonging to the genres of revisionist history and feminist literature, and employs themes of gender, religion, and power. Bradley wrote it after the success of her 1983 novel The Mists of Avalon, a re-telling of the Arthurian legend from a female perspective. To appeal to a wider readership, The <b>Firebrand</b> includes fewer elements of fantasy than Bradley's previous works. Her only novel set in ancient Greece, her husband Walter H. Breen helped her research the story.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{majority}} of the Royal Navy, Balchen was placed in reserve at the war's conclusion and returned to England to await further deployment. Whilst there, he married Susannah Apreece, daughter of an army colonel. The marriage produced six children, two of whom survived into adulthood; Frances, who later married Temple West (Vice Admiral Temple West) and George, who followed his father into the Navy. In 1701, Balchen was again at sea, commanding the small fireships HMS <b>Firebrand</b> and then HMS Vulcan with Sir George Rooke's fleet off the Spanish coast at the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession. He was probably engaged during the Battle of Vigo Bay in 1702, where Rooke's fleet captured a Spanish treasure fleet and was instrumental in the capture of the 56-gun Modéré, which he went on to briefly command as HMS Modéré.|$|E
5|$|Character {{selection}} was a collaborative process between Capcom and Marvel. According to Seth Killian, a former community manager for Capcom, Marvel presented {{a list of}} their own characters that {{they were interested in}} seeing in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Capcom then provided input regarding moveset possibilities in order to reach a consensus. Each company also had their own set of interests and priorities. Marvel characters, such as Rocket Raccoon and Nova, were chosen to cross-promote upcoming products. On the other hand, Capcom sought to bring more diversity into the cast. For example, Capcom wanted a monster-like character that could fight while in the air, leading to the inclusion of <b>Firebrand.</b>|$|E
40|$|Results of a {{research}} program on the burning properties, flight paths and lifetimes of buring particles of wood are given in the paper. This study is related to fire spread produced by fire brands, which is the dominating propagation mechanism in major forest fires. The laws of variation of the aerodynamic drag and weight of <b>firebrands</b> as functions, of both time and relative wind speed are obtained experimentally in a wind tunnel. From these data the flight paths and corresponding lifetimes of the <b>firebrands</b> are calculated for giving horizontal wind conditions and for a certain model of the convection column above a fire. The conclusion was drawn {{that it is an}} excellent approximation to assume that the <b>firebrands</b> always fly at their final or terminal velocity of fall. This assumption considerably reduces the experimental work as well as the theoretical studies. The results obtained permit the valuation of the dangerous areas of possible fire propagation. Comparative results of the potential danger of <b>firebrands</b> according to size, shape, kind of wood, moisture content, and wind conditions are shown. A preliminary study of the general laws governing combustion of wood with forced convection is also included...|$|R

5|$|Operational {{experience}} had found Blackburn's <b>Firebrand</b> strike fighter {{to be far}} from suited to carrier operations. In particular, the pilot sat near the wing's trailing edge, looking over a very long and wide nose which gave a particularly poor view for landing. The Firecrest had also been rendered obsolete {{by the arrival of}} gas turbine engines, and while Blackburn did draw up proposals for turboprop-powered derivatives of the Firecrest, (as the B-62 (Y.A.6) with the Armstrong Siddeley Python engine), these went unbuilt, with orders instead going to Westland for the Wyvern. The two flying prototypes remained in use until 1949, being sold back to Blackburn in 1950, and were later scrapped.|$|E
5|$|The Blackburn <b>Firebrand</b> was a British {{single-engine}} strike fighter for the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy designed during World War II by Blackburn Aircraft. Originally {{intended to}} serve as a pure fighter, its unimpressive performance and the allocation of its Napier Sabre piston engine by the Ministry of Aircraft Production for the Hawker Typhoon caused it to be redesigned as a strike fighter to take advantage of its load-carrying capability. Development was slow and the first production aircraft was not delivered until {{after the end of the}} war. Only a few hundred were built before it was withdrawn from front-line service in 1953.|$|E

She conducted deck-landing trials for prototypes of the Blackburn <b>Firebrand</b> and Fairey Firefly fighters, {{as well as the}} Fairey Barracuda dive/torpedo bomber from 8 to 10 February. On 26 February she began a refit at Birkenhead that lasted until 7 June during which her flight deck was extended, new radars were installed, her light antiaircraft armament was augmented, and two new arrestor wires were fitted aft of the rear lift which increased her effective landing area. While conducting her postrefit trials, she also conducted flying trials for Martlet Vs and Barracudas. Both sets of trials were completed by 18 July, by which time the Illustrious had joined the Home Fleet.|$|E
