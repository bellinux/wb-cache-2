40|$|While {{scholars}} have long probed the original understanding {{of judicial review}} and the <b>early</b> judicial review <b>case</b> <b>law,</b> this article presents {{a study of the}} judicial review <b>case</b> <b>law</b> in the United States before Marbury v. Madison that is dramatically more complete than prior work and that challenges previous scholarship on the original understanding of judicial review on the two most critical dimensions: how well judicial review was established {{at the time of the}} Founding and when it was exercised. Where prior work argues that judicial review was rarely exercised before Marbury (or that it was created in Marbury), this article shows that it was far more common than previously recognized: there are more than five times as many <b>cases</b> from the <b>Early</b> Republic as the leading historical account found. The article further shows that all of the cases in which statutes were invalidated fell into three categories: courts invalidated statutes that affected the powers of courts or juries, and they did so even when the legislation could plausibly be squared with constitutional text and prior practice; state courts invalidated state statutes for inconsistency with the federal constitution; and federal courts invalidated state statutes, and, again, they did so even when the statutes could plausibly be defended as constitutional. Scholars have missed this structural pattern, and the dominant view has been that only clearly unconstitutional statutes were invalidated. The article shows, instead, that the <b>early</b> <b>case</b> <b>law</b> reflects a structural approach to judicial review in which the level of scrutiny was closely linked to the nature of the challenged statute and that courts aggressively protected their power, the power of juries, and the power of the national government...|$|R
40|$|Betting on {{elections}} {{has a long}} history, despite {{periods in}} which wagers were unenforceable and even criminalised. In recent years, significant online markets have emerged, driven by the bookmaking industry in those jurisdictions which license betting on politics. These markets treat election wagers {{as a form of}} sports betting. This article examines the provenance and regulation of election betting in the common law. It charts this from <b>early</b> <b>case</b> <b>law</b> holding wagers involving electors to be void (as tainting voting decisions) through criminal prohibitions, some of which are still on the statute books (since wagers could disguise electoral bribes) and onto contemporary regimes for licensing electoral bookmaking. Normative arguments about election betting and the law include the liberal harm principle, the precautionary principle and the concept of commodification. The article concludes that friendly wagers should be permitted, to allow partisans to intensify the ritual experience of elections. But bets involving politicians should be outlawed, and the industrialisation of election betting should not be encouraged given the risk of commodifying the values underlying electoral democracy...|$|R

This fact, however, has been given hardly any attention in literature. It is all the more surprising because the lack of clear formulation of this concept was the main reason for criticism and controversy surrounding the principle. In the absence of a definition, the precautionary principle was a general notion, similar to the principles of subsidiarity or proportionality. Its scope was determined by decision makers and ultimately shaped by tendencies in case law.

40|$|The less {{favourable}} treatment (LFT) condition is {{a cornerstone of}} international trade law and is found in national treatment obligations that apply to both trade in goods (Articles III: 4 GATT 1994 and 2. 1 TBT Agreement) and trade in services (Article XVII GATS). In the case law, the LFT obligation focuses on whether the measure at issue results in a modification of the conditions of competition (MoCC) of the imported product or service (supplier) vis-à-vis the domestic product or service (supplier). Considering the difference in wording between the various national treatment provisions, and by adopting a comparative historical perspective to understand the centrality of MoCC in the LFT analysis, this paper analyses the GATT, TBT and GATS case law on MoCC, culminating for now in the Appellate Body report in EC – Seal Products. It concludes that the MoCC element of the LFT analysis should be—and always has been—approached exclusively as an effects test, which is common to GATT, TBT and GATS case law.

40|$|YesThe European Court of Justice {{has played}} a pivotal role in the {{transformation}} of international law obligations between Member States into an integrated legal order with direct applicability and effect in those Member States.

This paper argues that the Court’s decisions do continue to have significant impact on areas of law and policy and EU governance generally. It illustrates this argument using gender equality law and the Human Rights as pertinent examples and concludes that the ECJ remains relevant in governance terms as it continues to drive forward EU integration in many areas and influence the development of law and policy across the member states...|$|R
40|$|As digital {{networks}} {{emerge as}} the dominant means of distributing copyrighted works, the first sale doctrine is increasingly marginalized. The limitations first sale places on the exclusive right of distribution are of little importance when the alienation and use of copies entails their reproduction. This fact of the modern copyright marketplace has led to calls for statutory clarification of digital first sale rights. Acknowledging the obstacles to legislative intervention, this Article argues that courts are equipped today to limit copyright exclusivity in order to enable copy owners to make traditionally lawful uses of their copies, including resale through secondary markets. We argue that first sale is not simply an isolated limitation on the distribution right. Instead, it is a component of a broader principle of copyright exhaustion that emerges from <b>early</b> <b>case</b> <b>law</b> preceding the Supreme Court’s foundational decision in Bobbs-Merrill v. Strauss. This context reveals a common law of copyright exhaustion that embraces a set of user privileges that includes not only alienation, but renewal, repair, adaptation, and preservation. Despite congressional recognition of exhaustion in sections 19 and 117 of the Copyright Act, this Article concludes that courts have ample room to apply and continue to develop common law rules that preserve the many benefits of the first sale doctrine in the digital marketplace...|$|R

40|$|Corporatism, {{or private}} {{interest}} government, raises objections both from a democratic and {{from an economic}} perspective. This paper examines the application of EU competition law to private rule making that is purportedly in the public interest. <b>Earlier</b> <b>case</b> <b>law</b> holding Member States responsible for anticompetitive delegation (Van Eycke) can be contrasted with case law {{that focuses on the}} inherent restrictions of the pursuit of public policy aims and keeps some private arrangements outside the scope of the cartel prohibition altogether (Wouters). More recently we can identify an approach where the public and private activities of entities are considered separately (SELEX). The 2014 ONP Case is an example where the General Court distinguishes private and public interests, and takes a tough line where the limits of the latter are exceeded. Corporatism is therefore, to some extent, contained by EU competition law. However, there is a related trend toward taking account of public interest requirements in antitrust under the directly applicable exemption provision of Article 101 (3) TFEU. Alongside the abovementioned Wouters approach that requires balancing under Article 101 (1) TFEU, and given the context of the decentralisation of EU antitrust law, this raises a risk of fragmentation that remains to be addressed...|$|E

Although some experts, admittedly, had been skeptical about certain aspects of Draft Accession Agreement, {{no one seems to}} have expected an opinion so critical and uncompromising. The opinion has consequently received widespread disapproval in the EU legal blogosphere. While there are many threads in Opinion 2 / 13 that deserve critical analysis, I will focus here only on one: The CJEU’s interpretation and application of Article 344 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) —one of the five separate grounds given for rejecting the Accession Agreement. Specifically, I will compare the approach taken in Opinion 2 / 13 with the approach of the CJEU in earlier case-law. I will argue that the reasoning and conclusion concerning TFEU Article 344 in Opinion 2 / 13 is clearly at odds with this <b>earlier</b> <b>case</b> <b>law,</b> notably the leading MOX Plant case.

40|$|The French Constitutional Council {{recently}} {{declared that}} “racial and ethnic origins” are not objective legislative criteria and conflict with Article 1 of the French Constitution. Both <b>earlier</b> <b>case</b> <b>law</b> {{as well as}} the specific political background outside and within the Constitutional Council, indicate that the result does not come as a surprise. In fact, “race” and “racial origins” are extremely controversial terms, especially in France, where they clash with a universal, Republican view of citizenship. This has, for instance, led to the introduction of territorial measures which, as opposed to identitybased ones, have mostly passed constitutional muster. The decision equally raises a number of broader issues. First, what relevance does it assume at the European level, especially when read in the light of Directive 2000 / 43 and case law by the European Court of Justice concerning affirmative action and indirect discrimination? Second, what influence may its reasoning exercise on other European constitutional courts that will in the future have to decide on similar issues? In fact, demographic changes due to immigration will sooner or later have to lead to an increase of measures taking into account the racial/ethnic origin of European citizens in order to fight discrimination of populations with an immigration background. In this sense, the Constitutional Council problematically adopted a very formalistic and short-sighted view, at the expense of a more substantive conception of the equality principl...|$|E
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{attribution}} potential of command {{responsibility in the}} cyber realm. The focus is on military commanders under whose command cyberattacks have been conducted that constitute or cause violations of international humanitarian law. While the law on command responsibility has seen some significant developments in the <b>early</b> <b>case</b> <b>law</b> of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, its application and practical effect has been quite limited. Prosecutors often opt to charge under other theories of liability, such as aiding and abetting and Joint Criminal Enterprise. Securing convictions under these liability theories is less onerous. Over the years, however, command responsibility has been broadened. The recent International Criminal Court ruling in Bemba {{can be regarded as}} another step in expanding the reach of command responsibility. Taking account of a more expansive concept of command responsibility, I discuss three scenarios of cyberwar crimes where the link between the commander and the crime differ in proximity. Command responsibility is most likely to trigger liability when cyber units are integrated into the army and are part of regular operations (scenario 1). Outsourcing cyber operations, however, can trigger liability, even when hackers remain anonymous (scenario 2). This would, however, require proof of link between a commander’s subordinates and (anonymous) hackers. When there is no such link there can be no command responsibility (scenario 3) ...|$|R

The term 2 ̆ 2 public 2 ̆ 2 is a bit misleading. The persons exercising the rights are for the most part private persons, just as are the persons owning shoreline tracts; and the uses within the rights, though important to society, are not more important than some shoreline uses. In some states the rights have been court-created; are said to be held by the state in trust for the public; and may be enforced by the state or private persons. Modem Indiana law pertaining to public uses of water, however, is largely statutory.

[...] The case involved a copyright infringement suit between early reporters of U.S. Supreme Court opinions, {{both of whom were}} selling editions of their reports. Peters, who had replaced Wheaton, the reporter from 1816 to 1827, decided to market a less expensive product in which he omitted Wheaton's annotations and summaries but copied the texts of the Supreme Court's opinions, both those preceding his term as reporter and those he reported himself. Wheaton found his market dried up and sued Peters for infringement. Wheaton lost in the trial court and appealed to the Supreme Court, which affirmed the judgment. The Court's opinion concluded: [...] "It may be proper to remark that the Court is unanimously of opinion that no reporter has or can have any copyright in the written opinions delivered by this Court, and that the judges thereof cannot confer on any reporter any such right." [...] Thus, any copyright protection for publications of judicial opinions could cover only the added materials such as summaries of the opinions and commentaries on them, but not the judicially authored texts of the opinions themselves. Counsel for both parties in the case agreed that statutes could not be copyrighted.|$|R
