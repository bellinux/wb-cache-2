40|$|Chromium {{is largely}} used as {{alloying}} elements in steels for production of stainless steels. It is added {{in form of}} <b>ferro-chromium,</b> which is presently imported from Russia and Germany to meet the need of Nigerian Steel Industry.

This work involves the analysis of collected ore samples from Anka in Zamfara State. The samples assaying 36. 84 % of Cr 2 O 3 was subjected to beneficiation process in order to enrich the ore, in terms of the Cr 2 O 3, using magnetic separation. The results obtained after the analysis of the beneficiated ore using wet chemical analysis and Atomic Absorption Spectrometer shows that Cr 2 O 3 content increased to 48 % with a maximum Cr:Fe ratio of 6. 2 : 1.

40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of solid waste materials is closely linked to their potential to produce a hazardous leachate once deposited in a landfill. This potential is conventionally assessed with simple laboratory batch leach tests, which find more and more frequent application also in the minerals and metals industry. Such tests are intended to help distinguish {{between high and low}} risk wastes, but are completely unsuitable to allow quantitative prediction or modelling of the long-term leachate generation potential. In the present approach the leachate generation process is perceived as a combination of bulk convective transport, stagnant zone and inner particle diffusion, as well as reaction kinetic effects. Model equations are formulated accordingly. A modelling framework, WASTESIM, has been developed at UCT, which allows flexible combination of the model components and simulation of leach scenarios. Quantitative model parameters are obtained from a systematic laboratory study on the waste material in question. The combined assessment and modelling approach is demonstrated with a study on Cr(VI) leaching from a <b>ferro-chromium</b> slag material. Although not straightforward, the approach is particularly useful in determining long-term liabilities in the context of waste disposal sites with considerably more reliability than has previously been possible.

40|$|Production of <b>ferro-chromium</b> in the {{submerged-arc}} furnace {{is highly}} energy-intensive. Several process {{rates have been}} attempted to reduce the specific energy consumption {{in the production of}} this alloy. An exhaustive understanding of the thermo-chemical features of the production process can be used to reduce the specific power consumption significantly. The knowledge can be used to reduce the energy drain through undesired reactions in the process can be minimised. Plant trials have shown that specific energy consumption upto 100 kWh/tonne of hot metal can be obtained by adopting this strategy. The process requires modification in oper-ation practice and does not require any capital investment unlike other processes adopted for reducing power consumption.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the effects of}} temperature, addition of ferro-silicon and fluxing agents {{for the production of}} high carbon <b>ferro-chromium</b> by self-reducing process. The use of self-reducing agglomerates for ferro-alloys production is becoming an emerging processing technology due to lowering the electric energy consumption and improving the metal recovery in comparison with traditional ones. The self-reducing pellets were composed by chromite, petroleum coke, cement and small (0. 1 % - 2 %) addition of ferro-silicon. The slag composition was adjusted by addition of fluxing agents. The reduction of pellets was carried out at 1773 K (1500 degrees C), 1823 K (1550 degrees C) and 1873 K (1600 degrees C) by using induction furnace. The products obtained, containing slag and metallic phases, were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and chemical analyses (XEDS). By increasing temperature from 1773 K to 1823 K large effect on the reduction time was observed. It decreased from 30 minutes to 10 minutes, for reaching around 0. 98 reduction fraction. No significant effect on reduction time was observed when the reduction temperature was increased from 1823 K to 1873 K. At 1773 K, the addition of 2 % of ferro-silicon in the pellet resulted in an increasing reaction rate of around 6 times, in comparison with agglomerate without this addition. The addition of fluxing agents (silica and hydrated lime) has effect on reduction time (inverse relationship) and the pellets become less porous after reduction...|$|E
40|$|The {{technology}} of self-reducing pellets for ferro-alloys production {{is becoming an}} emerging process due to the lower electric energy consumption and the improvement of metal recovery {{in comparison with the}} traditional process. This paper presents the effects of reduction temperature, addition of ferro-silicon and addition of slag forming agents for the production of high carbon <b>ferro-chromium</b> by utilization of self-reducing pellets. These pellets were composed of Brazilian chromium ore (chromite) concentrate, petroleum coke, Portland cement, ferro-silicon and slag forming components (silica and hydrated lime). The pellets were processed at 1 773 K, 1 823 K and 1 873 K using an induction furnace. The products obtained, containing slag and metallic phases, were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and chemical analyses (XEDS). A large effect on the reduction time was observed by increasing the temperature from 1 773 K to 1 823 K for pellets without Fe-Si addition: around 4 times faster at 1 823 K than at 1 773 K for reaction fraction close to one. However, when the temperature was further increased from 1 823 K to 1 873 K the kinetics improved by double. At 1 773 K, the addition of 2 % of ferro-silicon in the pellet resulted in an increasing reaction rate of around 6 times, in comparison with agglomerate without it. The addition of fluxing agents (silica and lime), which form initial slag before the reduction is completed, impaired the full reduction. These pellets became less porous after the reduction process.

40|$|A {{program was}} {{performed}} to address the mechanical and environmental needs of Stirling engine heater head and regenerator housing components, while reducing the dependence on strategic materials. An alloy was developed which contained no strategic elemental additions per se. The base is iron with additions of manganese, molybdenum, carbon, silicon, niobium, and <b>ferro-chromium.</b> Such an alloy should be producible {{on a large scale}} at very low cost. The resulting alloy, designated as NASAUT 4 G-Al, contained 15 Mn, 15 Cr, 2 Mo, 1. 5 C, 1. 0 Si, 1. 0 Nb (in weight percent) with a balance of Fe. This alloy was optimized for chemistry, based upon tensile strength, creep-rupture strength, fracture behavior, and fatigue resistance up to 800 C. Alloys were also tested for environmental compatibility. The microstructure and mechanic properties (including hardness) were assessed in the as-cast condition and following several heat treatments, including one designed to simulate a required braze cycle. The alloy was fabricated and characterized in the form of both equiaxed and columnar-grained castings. The columnar grains were produced by directional solidification, and the properties were characterized in both the longitudinal and transverse orientations. The NASAUT 4 G-Al alloy was found to be good in cyclic-oxidation resistance and excellent in both hydrogen and hot-corrosion resistance, especially in comparison to the baseline XF- 818 alloy. The mechanical properties of yield strength, stress-rupture life, high-cycle-fatigue resistance, and low-cycle-fatigue resistance were good to excellent in comparison to the current alloy for this application, HS- 31 (X- 40), with precise results depending in a complex manner on grain orientation and temperature. If required, the ductility could be improved by lowering the carbon content...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decades, the {{interest}} in corrosion of metals and alloys from an environmental and health perspective has increased rapidly {{as a consequence of}} stricter environmental and human exposure legislations, their extensive use as implant materials and an increasing understanding related to occupational and/or daily exposure to airborne particles. Corrosion-induced metal release, however, needs to be understood in detail and to include knowledge related to chemical speciation, i. e. the oxidation state, complexation and chemical form of released metals, parameters of high importance when considering toxicity. In this licentiate work, corrosion-induced metal runoff from roofing materials (copper, zinc, and chromium(III) -, and chromium(VI) surface treated galvanized steel) has been investigated from an environmental perspective with focus on chemical speciation of released metals (Papers I-II). From these papers it was evident that the total concentration measured in the runoff water is not sufficient for any environmental risk assessment. The environmental fate including changes in chemical speciation and hence metal precipitation has to be considered. For example, it was shown that the copper concentration decreased by three orders of magnitude already in the internal drainage system of a shopping centre with a copper roof, to a concentration lower than storm water collected from a nearby parking space (Paper I). Also, speciation measurements can explain corrosion, metal release and surface processes of chromium surface treated galvanized steel at different sites (urban and marine). Any environmental risk assessment has to be done by considering all metal species released, and compared with ecotoxic values. For example, when most chromium(VI) (the most toxic species) was released, significantly less zinc was released at the same time which decreased the overall ecotoxicity of the runoff water significantly (Paper II). When assessing environmental risks by standard laboratory tests, {{it is important to understand}} all mechanisms which are possibly influenced by individual experimental parameters and which often are different for different test substances. Some metals released, as seen in the case of iron, may precipitate with time and be pH-, solution- and buffering dependent. This behavior can lead to strongly underestimated measured metal concentrations (Paper III). When particles of metals or alloys are to be investigated (Papers III-VI), it is essential to conduct a thorough particle characterization, since the surface properties cannot be defined. In addition, the surface properties (oxide layer properties) change with varying particle size (Paper VI) and with other experimental parameters such as dispersion (Paper VI). All iron-, and chromium-based particles investigated (Papers III-VI) revealed large differences between alloy particles and pure metals. Particles of pure iron and nickel released significantly more metals compared with particles of the investigated alloys, whereas particles of pure chromium released less metals compared with the alloys. Particles of stainless steel (AISI 316 L), <b>ferro-chromium</b> and ferro-silicon-chromium released very low amounts of metals (Papers III-VI). The released quantity increased with increased acidity (Papers III-VI) and also in the presence of complexing agents (ongoing research). The manufacturing process is of high importance, as observed for stainless steel particles when compared with a side product from stainless steel production with similar composition that released significantly more metals (Paper III). Particles of metal oxides, i. e. chromium(III) oxide and iron(II,III) oxide, released very low amounts of metals due to their thermodynamic stability. Ongoing research activities focus on the specific influence of complexing agents and proteins on the metal release process from massive sheet and particles of metals and alloys. The applicability and the possibility to use different analytical tools are investigated and elaborated for small-sized particles. A detailed understanding of the correlation between material and particle characteristics, the metal release process, the chemical speciation in interaction with proteins and/or cells, and the particle/cell interaction is essential to enable any correlation between material/particle characteristics and toxicity. The aim of this licentiate summary is – in contrast to the six included scientific papers – to explain the importance of chemical speciation for corrosion processes from a health and environmental perspective in a popular way to reach a broad non-academic audience. The summary is hence written as a guidance document for stakeholders and the regulatory community working with environmental and health risk assessment. QC 2010100...|$|E
