40|$|This report {{describes}} a project aimed to improve fairness in Higher Education and other admissions systems by providing for an enhanced system of feedback, especially to unsuccessful applicants. The project objectives were {{to investigate the}} provision of high-quality <b>feedback</b> <b>to</b> <b>applicants</b> on their application to Higher Education, including types of applicant other than the typical 18 -year-old; to consider transferability to other types of admission system; and to consider how aggregated anonymous feedback {{could be used for}} quality assurance purposes...|$|E
40|$|The {{debate at}} {{national}} and institutional level {{has been going}} for many years with regard {{to whether or not}} applicants should be given details as to why they were not successful in gaining an offer of a place on a course/programme in Higher Education. The Supporting Professionalism in Admissions (SPA) Programme 1 is working with both the Delivery Partnership Steering Group (DPSG) and UCAS on <b>feedback</b> <b>to</b> <b>applicants.</b> SPA’s work on feedback includes developing a draft statement of good practice to inform the • JISC Scoping Study: Good practice in the provision of <b>feedback</b> <b>to</b> <b>applicants,</b> and in the use of technology to support this, • Delivery Partnership’s discussion of the recommendation by the Government in its response to the consultation Improving the HE Applications Process that HEIs should develop more informative letters to feed back to students, detailing particularly why their applications have been rejected. The DPSG has also established a working group to encourage the provision of clear, comparable entry requirement information, with a view to moving toward 100 % provision of Entry Profile information for students on the UCAS website for 2009 entry. SPA has undertaken a literature review on the web of information in this area, has considered th...|$|E
40|$|Since {{applicants}} to the International Student Research Fellowship must be nominated by his/her graduate institution, competition was exceedingly intense (12 % award rate) {{and all of}} the applications were of very high caliber. To try to discern the applicants with the highest scientific potential, the review panel members focused most heavily on information gleaned from the reference letters, and the research proposal, though the entire package was evaluated extremely rigorously. Unfortunately, due to the high number of applications to this program, individual feedback is not feasible. This document serves to provide <b>feedback</b> <b>to</b> <b>applicants</b> and to institutions about the review criteria in an effort to help make applications most competitive. Evaluating the Applicant’s Scientific Potential: Letters of Reference The letters of reference are very important in evaluating the applicant’s potential to be a leader in the scientific community. Evaluators look for superlatives of course, but also look to see that the applicant possesses the traits necessary to be a scientific leader – talent, creativity, excellent communication skills, perseverance, etc. Review panel members value letters with specific comparisons – “best graduate student I have eve...|$|E

40|$|Originally {{published}} in Journal of Perspectives in Applied Academic Practice, 2013. Stierer and Antoniou (2004) have described Pedagogic Research (PR) as primarily teachers undertaking research into {{aspects of their}} own teaching and learning. Consequently, those undertaking PR often occupy dual roles of teacher and researcher. Likewise the subjects being studied are often the researcher’s own students and thus also occupying dual roles of student and participant. The {{purpose of this article}} is to highlight the potential risks to valid, informed consent inherent in the nature of pedagogic research itself; due to the dual roles mentioned above and the blurred boundaries between practice development and PR. Whilst inaccurate or incomplete information for decision making is an obvious risk to informed consent, the risks to voluntary participation can be more subtle. Reference is made to a documentary analysis of <b>feedback</b> provided <b>to</b> <b>applicants</b> by a research ethics committee reviewing pedagogic research. Whilst this is not a research report of that study, it provides empirical evidence to support the arguments made in this article. The article concludes that the greatest risk to valid informed consent is the lack of awareness among practitioner-researchers of the risks to voluntary participation this type of research holds. The author highlights the role for academic developers in highlighting these issues on professional development programmes and to the wider academic community. It is also recommended that a clear institutional position on when teacher/researchers need to apply for ethical approval could also be useful, particularly if flexibility is built in to allow for informal discussions with the Chair of the REC...|$|R

Evaluating the Scientific Merit of the Research Proposal The most important section of the application is the research proposal. Since this section is weighted so heavily, it is critical that both the applicant and the thesis advisor detail each of their contributions (as well as contributions from others involved) in both the development of the ideas and the writing of the applicant’s proposal. These contributions should be detailed by the applicant in the research plan section, and by the thesis advisor in his/her letter of recommendation. Applicants also need to understand that not all of the scientists reviewing the proposal will be experts i...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the core competencies needed by state Baldrige examiners, to identify best practices in examiner training programs provided by state Baldrige organizations, and to identify best practices for teaching core competencies. A Delphi panel ranked core competencies, best practices, and best practices for teaching core competencies using a Likert-style survey. Descriptive statistics and a formula for determining consensus quantified the results. The key findings of this study were that the Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence continue to provide the core competencies for which examiners need to be trained to effectively evaluate and score applications and provide meaningful <b>feedback</b> <b>to</b> <b>applicants.</b> The best practices for teaching core competencies, however, vary according to the needs of each state organization and the expertise and teaching styles of the trainers in the various state organizations. Coaching was the one best practice upon which the panel agreed as being applicable to teaching most of the core competencies. A template for training examiners using the best practices for teaching core competencies was the outcome of this study. Recommendations include using this template to train examiners and using the actual teams, of which the examiners will be a part, for evaluating and scoring the applications from receipt of the application through the life of the application. It is recommended that the individual review of applications be eliminated. As examiners will work with the actual applications from the beginning of the process, it is recommended that the case study be eliminated as pre-work. It is also recommended that coaches work with the actual teams from the training session until the feedback report is written...|$|E
40|$|The Italian National Scientific Qualification (ASN) was {{introduced}} {{as a prerequisite}} for applying for tenured associate or full professor positions at state-recognized universities. The ASN is meant to attest that an individual has reached a suitable level of scientific maturity to apply for professorship positions. A five member panel, appointed for each scientific discipline, {{is in charge of}} evaluating applicants by means of quantitative indicators of impact and productivity, and through an assessment of their research profile. Many concerns were raised on the appropriateness of the evaluation criteria, and in particular on the use of bibliometrics for the evaluation of individual researchers. Additional concerns were related to the perceived poor quality of the final evaluation reports. In this paper we assess the ASN in terms of appropriateness of the applied methodology, {{and the quality of the}} <b>feedback</b> provided <b>to</b> the <b>applicants.</b> We argue that the ASN is not fully compliant with the best practices for the use of bibliometric indicators for the evaluation of individual researchers; moreover, the quality of final reports varies considerably across the panels, suggesting that measures should be put in place to prevent sloppy practices in future ASN rounds...|$|R
