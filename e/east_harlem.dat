5|$|The {{locations}} of the station entrances are all south of 96th Street. In 2009, there was a debate over {{the placement of the}} location of the street entrances. Because 96th Street divides the neighborhoods of the Upper East Side to the south and <b>East</b> <b>Harlem</b> to the north, some residents of <b>East</b> <b>Harlem</b> stated that their neighborhood was not served by the Second Avenue Subway.|$|E
5|$|Cotillo was {{a strong}} proponent of social and pro-labor legislation. He defended ethnic Italians against the {{stereotyping}} by Americans not of Italian descent, but also urged the need for Americanization of the Italian community. As such, he stood between the mores of the Italian ethnic ghetto in <b>East</b> <b>Harlem</b> where he grew up, and the judgment and norms of American society where he made his career.|$|E
5|$|On the Upper East Side, a bond for an {{unrelated}} project {{to complete the}} line passed in 2005. Construction on the new project commenced in 2007, and the first phase from 72nd Street to 96th Street opened on January 1, 2017. The planned Phase 2, to <b>East</b> <b>Harlem,</b> will utilize the sections of tunnel north of 96th Street that {{were built in the}} 1970s.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s, the {{hospital}} was threatened with closure due to funding cuts. NYC Mayor Ed Koch reached a $45 million, three-year agreement with the Department of Health and Human Services {{to develop a new}} project to demonstrate innovative ways of delivering health care to <b>East</b> <b>Harlem's</b> poor.|$|R
50|$|Manigault made {{a living}} by {{painting}} houses, mowing lawns, and working for the local recreation department. By the late 1980s, however, he was almost destitute, became frail, and suffered from serious heart problems. In February 1987, {{he had to have}} two heart operations.

5|$|Born in Naples, Italy, {{he came to}} the United States in 1895 {{with his}} parents at the age of nine. His father Francesco Cotillo, had been a caterer in Naples. The family {{originally}} came from Avellino (Montella), in the hinterland of Naples. The family settled in <b>East</b> <b>Harlem</b> in East 113th Street among the increasing numbers of Italian immigrants. His father took up catering again and opened a popular pastry and confectionery shop. He has been credited with introducing the Italian ice cream spumoni into the United States.|$|E
5|$|Cottilo {{would be}} elected to office from Italian <b>East</b> <b>Harlem</b> between 1912 and 1922. Raised in the ghetto, he was chosen by the largely Italian {{neighborhood}} and continued to depend upon their political support throughout his political career. He {{was a member of}} the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 28th District) in 1913, 1915 and 1916. He drew support from the Citizens Union and was identified for two notable pieces of legislation; pensions for widows and the Workmen's Compensations Law. He advocated for women's suffrage, gun control, the end of the death penalty and school lunch programs.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950 campaign, both Nixon and Douglas {{were accused}} of having a voting record {{comparable}} to that of New York Congressman Vito Marcantonio. The sole congressman from the American Labor Party at the time, Marcantonio represented <b>East</b> <b>Harlem.</b> He was accused of being a communist, though he denied being one; he rarely discussed the Soviet Union or communism. Marcantonio opposed restrictions on communists and the Communist Party, stating that such restrictions violated the Bill of Rights. He regularly voted against contempt citations requested by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), on which Nixon served.|$|E
5000|$|His first {{teaching}} {{jobs were}} in <b>East</b> <b>Harlem's</b> {{junior and senior}} high schools. He taught in Maryland at what is now Bowie State University and became a district superintendent at the School District of Philadelphia. He was named superintendent of the public schools in Wilmington, Delaware, in 1975, where he oversaw the implementation of a court-ordered desegregation plan that involved busing students between urban and suburban districts. Minter described that the effort [...] "isn't just a Wilmington matter, It's national need. It goes right to the fabric of the society." ...|$|R
5000|$|Later in the 1970s, the Highland Room became {{synonymous with}} a more {{contemporary}} and less frenetic style of Northern soul music, typified by records such as The Carstairs' [...] "It Really Hurts Me Girl", Voices of <b>East</b> <b>Harlem's</b> [...] "Cashin' In" [...] and the Charisma Band's [...] "Ain't Nothing Like Your Love". Because {{of the change in}} tempo, a slightly different shuffling dance style developed at the venue. This newer sound and dance style caused some controversy and {{led to the formation of}} the parallel Modern soul subgenre, which still exists today within and alongside the mainstream Northern soul movement.|$|R

5|$|Pacino {{was born}} in the <b>East</b> <b>Harlem</b> {{neighborhood}} of New York City, to Sicilian-American parents Salvatore and Rose (née Gerardi) Pacino. His parents divorced when he was two years old. His mother then took him to The Bronx to live with her parents, Kate and James Gerardi, who, coincidentally, had come from a town in Sicily named Corleone. His father, who was from San Fratello of Sicily, moved to Covina, California to work as an insurance salesman and restaurateur, and had not been in his life since then.|$|E
5|$|Phase 2, {{which does}} not have a set {{timetable}} for construction, is planned to extend service from 96th Street to 125th Street. During Phase 2, both <b>East</b> <b>Harlem</b> segments, between 99th Street and 105th Street, and between 110th Street and 120th Street will be connected, modified, and used for normal train service. In 2007, the MTA reported that the segments were in pristine condition. Under the approved plan, the MTA estimates to complete Phase 2 between 2027 and 2029, by which the Q and rush-hour N trains will be extended to 125th Street.|$|E

5000|$|The parish was {{established}} in 1883. Construction began in 1883 to designs by Napoleon LeBrun & Sons. The AIA Guide to New York City (2010) describes the church as an [...] "ornate brick and terra-cotta facade is one of <b>East</b> <b>Harlem's</b> special treasures. Neo-Italian Romanesque, it has an exuberance that evaded most of Northern Europe." [...] The church was completed in 1887 to the designs of Napoleon LeBrun & Sons, the Regina Angelorum (unified facade) was built 1907 to the designs of Neville & Bagge In 1927, the church built a four-storey brick dwelling house at 123-25 East 105th Street to designs by Thomas J.

5000|$|In March 1989, The Institute {{employed}} Seymour [...] "Sy" [...] Fliegel as {{a senior}} fellow and launched the Center for Educational Innovation (CEI). A former deputy superintendent of <b>East</b> <b>Harlem's</b> Community School District 4, Fliegel had launched a program in September 1970 to transform failing schools in District 4 into thriving, small, community-based schools. Fliegel and Institute senior fellow James Macguire wrote a book, The Miracle of East Harlem: The Fight for Choice in Public Education, to demonstrate how education reform can be achieved one school at a time. The Manhattan Institute has since launched a website, SchoolGrades.org, that ranks schools nationally based on a normed measure linked to the federal government’s NAEP (National Assessment of Educational Progress) exam.|$|R
5|$|The Phase 2 {{budget was}} {{originally}} $1.5 billion, {{which would be}} used to start construction of the tunnels; the MTA reduced the amount of money allocated in the budget, projecting that the agency {{would not be able to}} start construction by the end of the 5-year cycle in 2019. Although the MTA previously expressed concerns about funding the Capital Program, a spokesman stated that the reduction in funding was a result of uncertain timing and not money problems. The delay had upset politicians and residents of <b>East</b> <b>Harlem,</b> who objected to the 3-to-4-year delay.|$|E
5|$|To {{regain his}} strength, Edwards {{and his wife}} took a {{carriage}} to a rustic cottage refuge in Arkville in the Catskill Mountains but isolation, plain food and rest yielded little improvement. A physician was called and he informed Mrs. Edwards {{that there would be}} no recovery for her husband from the advanced Bright's disease with complications from chronic pneumonia so she brought him back to New York City. Edwards died at home at 185 East 116th Street in <b>East</b> <b>Harlem</b> late on June 9, 1891, just hours after returning.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{unification}} of the three subway companies that comprised the New York City Subway in 1940, elevated lines were being shut down {{all over the city}} and replaced by subways. The northern half of the Second Avenue Elevated, serving the Upper East Side and <b>East</b> <b>Harlem,</b> closed on June 11, 1940; the southern half, running through Lower Manhattan, East Midtown and across the Queensborough Bridge to Queens, closed on June 13, 1942. The demolition of the Second Avenue elevated caused overcrowding on the Astoria and Flushing Lines in Queens, which no longer had direct service to Manhattan's far East Side. Because of the elevated line's closure, as well as a corresponding increase in the East Side's population, the need for a Second Avenue subway increased.|$|E
50|$|District 228 four {{high schools}} serve the {{communities}} of Midlothian, Posen, Markham, Country Club Hills, most of Oak Forest and Hazel Crest, part of Tinley Park (<b>east</b> of <b>Harlem,</b> north of 183rd St), as well as small portions of Crestwood and Harvey.|$|R

5|$|Due in part {{to strong}} public support, the MTA Board {{committed}} in April 2000 to building a full-length subway line along the East Side, from <b>East</b> <b>Harlem</b> to Lower Manhattan. In May 2000, the MTA Capital Program Review Board approved the MTA's 2000–2004 Capital Program, which allocated $1.05 billion {{for the construction of}} the Second Avenue Subway. In 2001, a contract for subway design was awarded to DMJM Harris/Arup Joint Venture. A new draft statement proposed the full-length line from 125th to 14th Streets. South of 14th Street, the line could either travel under Chrystie Street, St. James Place and Water Street to a terminal in Lower Manhattan, or link to the existing Nassau Street Loop tracks J1 and J2 at Kenmare Street to provide access to Lower Manhattan. The Water Street option was the one eventually chosen.|$|E
5|$|With the city's {{economic}} and budgetary {{recovery in the}} 1990s, there was a revival of efforts to complete construction of the SAS. Rising ridership on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, the only subway trunk line east of Central Park, demonstrated {{the need for the}} Second Avenue Line, as capacity and safety concerns rose. The four-track IRT Lexington Avenue Line, the lone rapid transit option in the Upper East Side and <b>East</b> <b>Harlem</b> since the 1955 closure of the Third Avenue elevated, is the most crowded subway line in the country. The line saw an average of 1.3 million daily riders in 2015; this is more than the daily ridership of the second-busiest subway system in the U.S., the Washington Metro, as well as more than the combined daily riderships of San Francisco's and Boston's transit systems. Local bus routes are just as crowded during various times of the day, with the paralle M15 local and M15 Select Bus Service routes seeing 46,000 passengers per weekday in 2016, translating to 14.5 million passengers yhat year.|$|E

50|$|In 1937, Garcia Rivera, who {{had joined}} the Republican Party, {{launched}} his candidacy for the New York State Assembly as <b>East</b> <b>Harlem's</b> representative {{with the support of}} Independent Democrats, leftists, fusionists, labor unions, and the American Labor Party. Among those who supported his nomination were: New York City's Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, Manhattan D.A. Thomas E. Dewey, and Union leaders like Michael J. Quill, TWU, George Meaney, AFL/CIO, Alex Rose and Benjamin MacLauren. He was elected to the Assembly (New York Co., 17th D.), thus becoming the first Puerto Rican in history to be elected to public office in the United States, and took his seat in the 161st New York State Legislature in 1938. In June 1938, he was refused a renomination by the Republicans, but was re-elected in November 1938 on the American Labor ticket only. He sat in the 162nd New York State Legislature in 1939 and 1940. During his term in office, he emphasized issues of child labor, protective laws for workers, labor services, and anti-discrimination legislation.|$|R
