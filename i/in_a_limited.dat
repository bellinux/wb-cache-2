40|$|A mutual {{action of}} the random {{anisotropy}} brought in the superfluid 3 He by aerogel and of the global anisotropy caused by its deformation is considered. Strong global anisotropy tends to suppress fluctuations of orientation of the order parameter and stabilizes ABM order parameter. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> of vanishing anisotropy these fluctuations are getting critical. It is argued that still <b>in</b> <b>a</b> region of small fluctuations the average order parameter can acquire "robust" component. This component maintains a long-range order even <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> of vanishing global anisotropy.

40|$|The optimal {{placement}} problem studies how to optimally place orders <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> order book to purchase/sell a fixed {{number of shares}} of a stock. Under a correlated random walk model with mean-reversion for the best ask/bid price, optimal placement strategies for both single-step and multi-step cases are derived in this thesis. In the single-step case, the optimal strategy involves only the market order, the best bid, and the second best bid. In the multi-step case, the optimal strategy is of a threshold type. Critical to the analysis is a generalized reflection principle for correlated random walks. Furthermore, a simple linear price impact model is also presented, which gives insight into the price impact of executing large orders on placement decisions. The availability of detailed limit order book information enables more accurate estimation of the order execution probability and price dynamics. Motivated by various optimization problems and models <b>in</b> algorithmic trading, <b>a</b> <b>limiting</b> behavior for order positions and related best bid/ask queues <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> order book is studied in this thesis. In addition to the fluid and diffusion limits for the processes, fluctuations of the order position and related queues around their fluid <b>limit</b> are analyzed. <b>As</b> a corollary, explicit analytical expressions for various quantities of interests <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> order book are derived...|$|R
