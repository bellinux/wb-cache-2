5|$|A {{number of}} plants are {{poisonous}} to guinea pigs, including bracken, bryony, buttercup, charlock, deadly nightshade, foxglove, hellebore, hemlock, lily of the valley, mayweed, monkshood, privet, ragwort, rhubarb, speedwell, toadflax (both Linaria vulgaris and Linaria dalmatica), and wild celery. Additionally, any plant which grows from a bulb (e.g., tulip or onion) <b>is</b> <b>normally</b> considered poisonous, as well as ivy and oak tree leaves.|$|E
5|$|A {{stationary}} front is a non-moving (or stalled) boundary between two air masses, {{neither of which}} {{is strong enough to}} replace the other. They tend to remain essentially in the same area for extended periods of time, usually moving in waves. There <b>is</b> <b>normally</b> a broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherm packing.|$|E
50|$|Primary Schools in the Education Queensland system <b>are</b> <b>normally</b> named Suburb/Locality/Town/District State School.

During the elections women won two seats, and though Tubas <b>is</b> <b>normally</b> a Fatah stronghold, all seats were won by independent political lists.|$|E
5|$|Capybaras {{have adapted}} {{well to the}} {{urbanization}} in South America. They {{can be found in}} many areas in zoos and parks, and may live for 12 years in captivity. Capybaras are gentle and usually allow humans to pet and hand-feed them, but physical contact <b>is</b> <b>normally</b> discouraged, as their ticks can be vectors to Rocky Mountain spotted fever.|$|E
5|$|Experimental is a {{temporary}} staging area of highly experimental software {{that is likely to}} break the system. It is not a full distribution and missing dependencies are commonly found in unstable, where new software without the damage chance <b>is</b> <b>normally</b> uploaded.|$|E
50|$|Coordinates to {{describe}} observations made from an aircraft <b>are</b> <b>normally</b> given relative to its intrinsic axes, but normally using as positive the coordinate pointing downwards, where the interesting points are located. Therefore, they <b>are</b> <b>normally</b> NED.|$|R
50|$|Planned {{preventive}} maintenance and statutory inspections of equipment <b>are</b> <b>normally</b> carried {{out during the}} day shift when all specialist trades are available. Outside of the day shift minimal manning levels <b>are</b> <b>normally</b> retained to cover breakdowns and emergency repairs only.|$|R
5000|$|Integral-horsepower {{electric}} motors <b>are</b> <b>normally</b> three-phase, alternating-current motors. Fractional-horsepower {{electric motors}} <b>are</b> <b>normally</b> single-phase, alternating-current motors {{and are used}} when less than [...] is required. Since most dust collection systems require motors with more than , only integral-horsepower motors are discussed here.|$|R
5|$|Fruit <b>is</b> <b>normally</b> {{picked by}} a perched bird, {{although}} there is a record of a mulberry fruit being taken in flight. Garden warblers often feed with conspecifics and other fruit-eating passerines. Over 35 plant species have been recorded as food for this warbler just in central Europe, with many additional species being consumed in the Mediterranean region and on the African wintering grounds.|$|E
5|$|Germanium <b>is</b> <b>normally</b> {{absent in}} diamond, {{but it can}} be {{introduced}} during the growth or by subsequent ion implantation. Germanium in diamond can be detected optically via the germanium-vacancy center, which has similar properties to those of the Si-vacancy center.|$|E
5|$|Heterozygous FH <b>is</b> <b>normally</b> {{treated with}} statins, bile acid sequestrants, or other lipid {{lowering}} agents that lower cholesterol levels. New cases are generally offered genetic counseling. Homozygous FH often {{does not respond}} to medical therapy and may require other treatments, including LDL apheresis (removal of LDL in a method similar to dialysis) and occasionally liver transplantation.|$|E
50|$|The tenor {{and bass}} {{varieties}} <b>are</b> <b>normally</b> keyed; the alto and soprano varieties are sometimes keyed. The highest varieties <b>are</b> not <b>normally</b> keyed.|$|R
50|$|Five {{subspecies}} <b>are</b> <b>normally</b> recognized.|$|R
50|$|Science fair {{projects}} <b>are</b> <b>normally</b> {{intended to}} demonstrate scientific concepts {{on a small}} scale. Science fair projects normally have a purpose, hypothesis, independent variable, dependent variable, experiment results, and a conclusion, and <b>are</b> <b>normally</b> intended to teach students about the scientific method.|$|R
5|$|In Spain, {{this species}} <b>is</b> <b>normally</b> caught as it migrates through the country, often using birdlime which, {{although}} {{banned by the}} European Union, is still tolerated and permitted in the Valencian Community. In 2003 and 2004 the EU tried, but failed, to stop this practice in the Valencian region.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{westerly}} wind increases {{associated with}} the Madden–Julian oscillation lead to increased tropical cyclogenesis in all tropical cyclone basins. As the oscillation propagates from west to east, it leads to an eastward march in tropical cyclogenesis with time during that hemisphere's summer season. On average, twice per year twin tropical cyclones will form in the western Pacific Ocean, near the 5th parallel north and the 5th parallel south, along the same meridian, or line of longitude. There is an inverse relationship between tropical cyclone activity in the western Pacific basin and the north Atlantic basin, however. When one basin is active, the other <b>is</b> <b>normally</b> quiet, and vice versa. The main reason for {{this appears to be}} the phase of the Madden–Julian oscillation, or MJO, which <b>is</b> <b>normally</b> in opposite modes between the two basins at any given time.|$|E
5|$|It {{has a long}} broad {{nose and}} muzzle, with thick ears covered in silky hair that usually end around {{the tip of the}} muzzle. Its chest is of medium size that descends down to the same level as the elbows. Both the {{forequarters}} and the hindquarters are well muscled. Its tail typically does not extend beyond the hock and <b>is</b> <b>normally</b> straight.|$|E
50|$|Sampling a {{selection}} of cheeses, {{at home or in}} a restaurant, may also be called a dégustation. Three to four varieties <b>are</b> <b>normally</b> chosen, generally including a semi-soft cheese, a goat's cheese, and a blue cheese. The stronger varieties <b>are</b> <b>normally</b> tasted last.|$|R

50|$|MRC CEOs <b>are</b> <b>normally</b> {{automatically}} knighted.|$|R
5|$|No {{preparation}} <b>is</b> <b>normally</b> {{necessary for}} this examination, {{but if a}} complementary study of abdominal veins is also required, the patient {{will be asked to}} fast for 12 hours beforehand. The sensitivity and specificity measurements are around 90%.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{toxicity}} {{is caused}} by exposure to oxygen at partial pressures greater than those to which the body <b>is</b> <b>normally</b> exposed. This occurs in three principal settings: underwater diving, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, {{and the provision of}} supplemental oxygen, particularly to premature infants. In each case, the risk factors are markedly different.|$|E
5|$|Several Listeria and Shigella species move inside host cells by usurping the cytoskeleton, which <b>is</b> <b>normally</b> used to move organelles {{inside the}} cell. By {{promoting}} actin polymerisation at one pole of their cells, they can form {{a kind of}} tail that pushes them through the host cell's cytoplasm.|$|E
5000|$|In written Polish, {{subordinate}} clauses <b>are</b> <b>normally</b> set {{off with}} commas. Commas <b>are</b> not <b>normally</b> used before conjunctions meaning [...] "and" [...] or [...] "or".|$|R
