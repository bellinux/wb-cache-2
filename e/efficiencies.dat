30|$|The {{concept of}} {{technical}} <b>efficiency</b> was first proposed by Farrell (1957) {{based on the}} works of Debreu (1951) and Koopmans (1951). In his study, Farrell identified two forms of efficiency: technical <b>efficiency</b> and allocative <b>efficiency.</b> Technical <b>efficiency</b> reflects {{the ability of a}} firm to obtain maximum output based on a given set of inputs. Meanwhile, allocative <b>efficiency</b> measures the ability to use the optimal input set based on available prices and production techniques. Allocative <b>efficiency</b> is therefore also called price <b>efficiency.</b> Technical <b>efficiency</b> and allocative <b>efficiency</b> can be combined to measure the economic <b>efficiency</b> (or overall cost <b>efficiency)</b> of a firm.|$|R

5|$|In {{the last}} two decades, {{photovoltaics}} (PV), also known as solar PV, has evolved from a pure niche market of small scale applications towards becoming a mainstream electricity source. A solar cell is a device that converts light directly into electricity using the photoelectric effect. The first solar cell was constructed by Charles Fritts in the 1880s. In 1931 a German engineer, Dr Bruno Lange, developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide. Although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity, both Ernst Werner von Siemens and James Clerk Maxwell {{recognized the importance of}} this discovery. Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the crystalline silicon solar cell in 1954. These early solar cells cost 286USD/watt and reached <b>efficiencies</b> of 4.5–6%. By 2012 available <b>efficiencies</b> exceeded 20%, and the maximum efficiency of research photovoltaics was in excess of 40%.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines are relatively inefficient at converting on-board fuel energy to propulsion {{as most of}} the energy is wasted as heat, and the rest while the engine is idling. Electric motors, on the other hand, are more efficient at converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. Electric drive vehicles do not consume energy while at rest or coasting, and modern plug-in cars can capture and reuse as much as one fifth of the energy normally lost during braking through regenerative braking. Typically, conventional gasoline engines effectively use only 15% of the fuel energy content to move the vehicle or to power accessories, and diesel engines can reach on-board <b>efficiencies</b> of 20%, while electric drive vehicles typically have on-board <b>efficiencies</b> of around 80%.|$|E
