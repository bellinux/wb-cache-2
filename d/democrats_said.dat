5|$|Jackson quickly built a {{track record}} of never missing a floor vote. Once he nearly missed his great-grandmother's funeral for a roll call, but the {{presiding}} officer was able to slightly delay the closing the roll, thereby keeping his attendance record. Fellow <b>Democrats</b> <b>said</b> he debates and votes with a contentiousness that makes it difficult to view him as a team player. Jackson developed foes not only in the House, but also in Chicago against William Daley, who had a hand in several attempts to block Jackson's seating on the transportation committee he desired because of his support for a third Chicago airport. Jackson has also been a target of conservative media figures. Jackson established a heavily liberal voting record on both social and fiscal issues. During the 1990s, because of his name recognition and liberal track record, Jackson received many public speaking and media requests.|$|E
25|$|The {{divisions}} became fully exposed {{with the}} 1860 presidential election. The electorate split four ways. The Southern Democrats endorsed slavery, while the Republicans denounced it. The Northern <b>Democrats</b> <b>said</b> democracy required {{the people to}} decide on slavery locally, state by state and territory by territory. The Constitutional Union Party said {{the survival of the}} Union was at stake and everything else should be compromised.|$|E
25|$|His {{coalition}} partners in government, the Progressive <b>Democrats,</b> <b>said</b> {{that he had}} questions to answer as details of an £8,000 (€11,800) payment for speaking engagements, in Manchester in 1994, emerged. The continued appearance of details of his appearances in Manchester {{and the names of}} those who were present at functions threatened to destabilise his Coalition Government, especially so when it transpired that one of the businessmen Micheál Wall subsequently sold a house to Ahern. The strains in the coalition eased after Ahern apologised for a second time in the Dáil and agreed to tighten up on ethics legislation.|$|E

25|$|Both {{before and}} after passage in the House, {{significant}} controversy surrounded the Stupak–Pitts Amendment added to the bill to prohibit coverage of abortions – with limited exceptions – in the public option or {{in any of the}} exchange's private plans sold to customers receiving federal subsidies. In mid-November, it was reported that 40 House <b>Democrats</b> <b>said</b> they will not support a final bill containing the Amendment's provisions. Stupak has said that 15–20 Democrats will oppose adoption of the Senate bill because of objections to its abortion provisions as well as its tax on high-value health insurance plans. In March 2010, Stupak voted for the Senate language health care bill excluding the Stupak Amendment language.|$|E
500|$|The main {{opposition}} parties were critical in {{their responses to}} the manifesto. The Conservative Party {{said that it would}} [...] "change nothing", while the Liberal <b>Democrats</b> <b>said</b> that Labour would not reform tax and politics. Conservative leader David Cameron said, [...] "There is nothing new there, there is nothing different there". Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg asked how Labour could deliver [...] "fairness and new politics" [...] when they had promised the same at previous general elections but had failed to do so.|$|E
500|$|On March 3, 2010, Rangel said {{he would}} take {{a leave of absence}} as chair, pending {{issuance}} of the Ethics Committee's report. Pelosi granted his request, but whether such a leave was possible was unclear and the House Speaker pro Tempore said that a resignation had taken place and that Rangel was no longer chair. Observers opined that it was unlikely that Rangel would ever be able to regain the position. [...] Several <b>Democrats</b> <b>said</b> they would return or donate to charity campaign contributions given to them by Rangel. [...] Representative Sander M.

5000|$|On December 11, 2007, the {{conservative}} news website Drudge Report, stated in an 'exclusive' {{report that the}} highest levels of the Democratic Party told their officials to avoid any criticism of 2008 Republican presidential contender Mike Huckabee, until he would secure the nomination.

500|$|The House Government Reform and Oversight Committee {{issued its}} {{majority}} report on September 18, 1996, {{in which it}} accused the Clinton administration of having obstructed the committee's efforts to investigate the Travelgate scandal. [...] It portrayed Bill Clinton as being heavily involved in the travel office affair, {{more than any other}} investigation. [...] The report's chapter titles were lurid: [...] "The White House Stonewalled All Investigations into the White House Travel Office Firings and Related Matters", [...] "The White House Initiated a Full-Scale Campaign of Misinformation in the Aftermath of the Travel Office Firings and President Clinton Led the Misinformation Campaign from the First Days of the Travelgate Debacle", [...] "Foster's Death Shattered a White House Just Recovering from an Abysmal First 6 Months of Administration", and so forth. [...] Democratic members of the Committee walked out in protest over the report, with ranking member Henry Waxman calling it [...] "an embarrassment to you , this committee and this Congress" [...] and [...] "a crassly partisan smear campaign against President Clinton, Mrs. Clinton and this administration." [...] The following month Clinger forwarded the report, along with one on Filegate, to the Independent Counsel, suggesting that the testimony of several witnesses be looked at for possible perjury or obstruction of justice. [...] <b>Democrats</b> <b>said</b> this was politically motivated in an attempt to influence the 1996presidential election.|$|E
500|$|The {{programme}} led to {{some political}} debate {{on the issue of}} welfare. Speaking in the House of Commons on 13 January, Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, suggested the programme justified the changes being made by the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government's Welfare Reform Act. The following week, Duncan Smith gave a speech to mark the tenth anniversary of his Centre for Social Justice in which he said that areas of the country were being ghettoised by long-term unemployment and had remained largely hidden from the rest of society. Conservative MP Simon Hart raised the subject of Benefits Street at Prime Minister's Questions on 15 January, saying that a street of the type seen in the series existed [...] "in every constituency in the land". Prime Minister and Conservative leader David Cameron responded that the government should [...] "intervene in people's lives" [...] to get them off benefits and into employment. After declining an invitation to visit James Turner Street, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal <b>Democrats,</b> <b>said</b> that he believed both left- and right-wing arguments on welfare were wrong. [...] "We want a welfare system which is compassionate." [...] Shortly after Clegg's comments, Birmingham councillor Desmond Jaddoo told the Birmingham Mail that he had compiled letters to Clegg, Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband on behalf of some James Turner Street residents inviting them to visit the street and asking for help to find employment.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Democrats</b> <b>said</b> {{that would}} fatten the rich; the tariff should be low—for [...] "revenue only" [...] (thus not to foster manufacturing). Whigs argued that banks and paper money were needed; the Democrats countered that no honest man wants them. Public works {{programs}} to build roads, canals and railroads {{would give the}} country the infrastructure it needed for rapid economic development, said the Whigs. Democrats replied {{they did not want}} that kind of complex change. Rather the Democrats called for more of the same—especially more farms to raise the families in the traditional style. More land is needed for that, <b>Democrats</b> <b>said,</b> so they pushed for expansion south and west. Jackson conquered Florida for the US. Over intense Whig opposition, his political heir, James Polk (1844–48) added Texas, the Southwest, California, and Oregon. Next on the Democratic agenda would be Cuba.|$|E
5000|$|House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a <b>Democrat,</b> <b>said</b> [...] "I've closely {{examined}} this document. And it {{will have}} my strong support."

2500|$|The Liberal <b>Democrats</b> <b>said</b> {{that they}} would talk first to {{whichever}} party won the most seats.

[...] <b>Democrats</b> <b>said</b> they intended to use the votes on this bill {{and the issue of}} equal pay as political issues in the 2014 midterm elections.

He had previously paid back £1,193 spent on chauffeur fares and overpayments on his mortgage after a complaint from a Labour activist, and it also emerged that he had claimed £47 for two copies of a DVD of his own speech on [...] "value for taxpayers' money". The report of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards found that although Osborne had breached the rules, the offence was [...] "unintended and relatively minor". Osborne said he had received [...] "flawed" [...] advice and not benefited personally.|$|E
2500|$|On October 7, 2007, The Washington Post {{reported}} that House Democrats planned to introduce alternative legislation which would provide for one-year [...] "umbrella" [...] warrants, and {{would require the}} Justice Department inspector general to audit the use of those warrants and issue quarterly reports to a special FISA court and to Congress. The proposed bill would not include immunity for telecommunications firms facing lawsuits {{in connection with the}} administration's NSA warrantless surveillance program. House <b>Democrats</b> <b>said</b> {{that as long as the}} administration withholds requested documents explaining the basis for the program that they cannot consider immunity for firms alleged to have facilitated it. On October 10, 2007 comments on the White House South Lawn, President Bush said he would not sign any bill that did not provide retroactive immunity for telecommunications corporations.|$|E
2500|$|One of Turner's {{campaign}} themes was fiscal recovery through cuts {{in federal}} spending. He {{said that the}} federal budget needed to be cut {{by as much as}} a third, that capital gains taxes should be eliminated, and corporate and individual income taxes reduced. He opposed what <b>Democrats</b> <b>said</b> were Republican plans to privatize Medicare and Social Security and turn Medicaid into a block-grant program, reportedly at the request of former New York mayor Ed Koch, who supported him. In endorsing Turner's opponent, The New York Times said that Turner's economic plan to reduce taxes without reducing benefits for current Medicare and Social Security recipients was unrealistic. [...] "That would take a magician, not a businessman", said the Times. One month before the election, Turner admitted that an op-ed he written for the National Review calling for a one third reduction in federal spending and [...] "an end to government dependencies" [...] was [...] "blatant pandering" [...] to [...] "a particular audience".|$|E

An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College poll conducted in late June 2017 found that 54% of respondents believed that Trump either did [...] "something illegal" [...] or [...] "something unethical, but not illegal" [...] in his dealings with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The poll reported that [...] "seventy-three percent of Republicans say Trump himself has done nothing wrong" [...] while 41% of Democrats believed that Trump did something that was illegal.
