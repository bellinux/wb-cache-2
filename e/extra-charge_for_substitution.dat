40|$|Urethral strictures and {{anomalies}} {{remain a}} challenging urological problem. Reconstructive plastic surgery {{has been shown}} to be the most effective way to treat them. There are two main types of urethroplasty: anastomosis (anastomotic urethroplasty) and expansion of the urethral lumen using of flaps and grafts (substitution urethroplasty). Currently the ideal material <b>for</b> <b>substitution</b> urethroplasty does not exist. Tissue engineering of the urethra seems to be one of the most promising approaches to address this problem. Various tissues-engineering techniques were proposed <b>for</b> <b>substitution</b> urethroplasty. In this study, tissue-engineering design was based on the decellularized cadaveric arterial wall. The study results demonstrated the feasibility of creating stable tissue-engineered structures with autologous cultured epithelial cells of the buccal mucosa and decellularized matrix from human cadaveric arterial wall (DMCAW). There was a complete engraftment of tissue-engineering design based on DMCAW and buccal mucosa cells, used <b>for</b> <b>substitution</b> urethroplasty in a patient with the bulbar urethral stricture. Postoperatively (within 4 months after surgery) no complications and/or adverse events were observed. However, in the late postoperative period (12 months) there was recurrence of urethral stricture in the middle of the tissue-engineering design and the native urethra that warranted another surgery. Tissue-engineering design based on DMCAW and autologous buccal mucosa is safe as a material <b>for</b> <b>substitution</b> urethroplasty. Further research is required to ascertain the effectiveness of the method. 7 page(s...|$|R

This paper uses random effects and stochastic frontier techniques to estimate an output distance function over the period 1997 / 97 to 2007 / 08 in order to investigate the efficiency of higher education institutions (HEIs) and to examine the opportunities <b>for</b> <b>substitution</b> between inputs. Mean efficiency across the whole sector {{is estimated to be}} 70 %, and further investigation reveals that the pattern of production in the typical institution in the highest efficiency quartile is closest to the pattern of production of the average pre- 1992 university. The Morishima elasticities calculated from the parameter estimates suggest that the main possibilities <b>for</b> <b>substitution</b> are out of undergraduates into other inputs and from administration into other inputs (except academic services). Opportunities <b>for</b> <b>substitution</b> are generally much more limited from postgraduate inputs, staff and academic services.
