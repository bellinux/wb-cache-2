40|$|The <b>cutting</b> <b>gas</b> jet is an {{essential}} parameter for laser beam cutting. The choice of the gas type defines the working atmosphere at the cutting front. When using oxygen additional energy {{is added to the}} cutting process by exothermal reaction, while the use of non-ractive gases during laser beam fusion cutting acoids additional reaction with the workpiece. The molten or vaporized material is blown out of the cutting kerf by the gas jet. It affects the melt film by shearing and pressure forces. Both momentum components are influenced by the velocity and pressure distribution of the gas flow within the cutting kerf. With the help of the Schlieren method these gasdynamical influences can be investigated. As a result, the principal pattern of the <b>cutting</b> <b>gas</b> flow and its functional dependences from nozzle design and nozzle adjustment, <b>cutting</b> <b>gas</b> pressure and <b>cutting</b> kerf geometry are reported in this paper...|$|R

The designed supersonic nozzle consisted of four sections: stable, convergent, throat and divergent. Each of these sections are designed strictly based on gas dynamic theories. The behavior of the exit jet and the distance of normal shock under condition of stagnation gas pressure ranging from 4 to 16 bar were investigated by computer simulation. The behavior of the exit jet in boundaryless condition as well as in slots of controlled dimensions were observed by Shadowgraphy.
