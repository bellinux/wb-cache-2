5|$|Despite Nebraska's early-season loss, the Cornhuskers still <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> win a record-setting third {{consecutive}} national championship. A win against Texas would earn Nebraska {{a bid to}} the Sugar Bowl and a game against No. 1 Florida State to decide the national championship. Unfortunately for Nebraska, the underdog Longhorns upset heavily favored Nebraska, 3727. Eight days after losing to Texas, Nebraska was awarded a bid to the Orange Bowl.|$|E
5|$|England won the toss and {{declined}} from 125/0 to 245 all out, {{the last five}} wickets tumbling for just 22 runs. Malcolm Marshall and Curtly Ambrose took all ten wickets between them. The West Indies racked up 448/9 despite no batsman reaching a century. England <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> {{get back into the}} match, but from 334/7, the unheralded batting of Marshall (72) and Ambrose (43*) took the tourists into a position of dominance.|$|E
5|$|In the 37th minute, Bahr took a {{long shot}} from twenty-five yards out, but as Williams moved to his right to intercept, Gaetjens dived headlong near the penalty spot, and grazed the ball enough to {{put it to the}} left of the English goalkeeper, whose {{momentum}} prevented him from changing direction, and into the back of the net. The crowd exploded as the U.S. improbably led 1–0. As the half drew to a close, Finney <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> equalize, but the whistle blew before he could shoot.|$|E

5|$|Miller was {{selected}} for an Australian XIa team comprising a mix of established international representatives and fringe playersfixture against the tourists prior to the Test series, but made only five runs with the bat and bowled only four overs, taking 0/8 in a rain-affected match that did not reach the second innings. In a Shield match against South Australia—led by national captain Don Bradman—at the Adelaide Oval, Miller <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> push for selection by performing well {{in front of the}} Australian captain, who was {{also a member of the}} three-man national selection panel.|$|E

For the offensive to succeed it was deemed essential to attack before the Soviets <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> prepare extensive defences or to launch an offensive of their own. Some military historians have described the operation using the term blitzkrieg (lightning war); other military historians do not use the term in their works on the battle.|$|E

5|$|On April 24, 2007, the Raptors {{won their}} first playoff game in five seasons, with an 89–83 {{victory over the}} New Jersey Nets, but lost the series 4–2. The series was notable for pitting ex-Raptor Vince Carter against his former team. The Nets took home court {{advantage}} in Game 1, holding off a late Raptors rally in the fourth quarter. The Raptors pulled away in another tight game to even the series at one game apiece. When the series shifted to New Jersey, the Nets {{took charge of the}} series, winning games 3 and 4 in routs. New Jersey <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> win the series in game 5 in Toronto, but the Raptors took a 20-point lead after one quarter. Still, New Jersey managed to chip away and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> win the game, but Boštjan Nachbar's three-pointer missed at the buzzer. Needing to win in New Jersey to force a game 7, Toronto held a one-point lead with under a minute to play in game 6, but Richard Jefferson hit a layup with eight seconds left to play. Toronto attempted to try for the game-winning shot, but Jefferson intercepted a pass to seal the series for the Nets.|$|E

He scored 87 against Surrey, 51 against Combined Services and 77 against Oxford University in the next seven matches {{leading up to the}} start of the Tests, with a total of 539 runs at 53.90 under his belt.|$|E

However, they lost a coin flip to the Los Angeles Lakers, and went on to choose David Greenwood with the second pick. Although Greenwood averaged 12.6 points over six seasons with the Bulls, he never became an NBA All-Star.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{won their}} first five games in 2009, but lost their next four. After beating the Atlanta Falcons in overtime, they lost badly to Denver on Thanksgiving.

He then took a total of 2/135 as Railways, the reigning Ranji Trophy holders, defeated the Rest of India in the Irani Trophy. With these lean returns, Kartik was overlooked for the Tests.|$|E
