25|$|In {{those with}} non-valvular atrial {{fibrillation}} {{it appears to}} be as effective as warfarin in preventing nonhemorrhagic strokes and <b>embolic</b> events. Rivaroxaban is associated with lower rates of serious and fatal bleeding events than warfarin though rivaroxaban is associated with higher rates of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
25|$|For {{those with}} non-valvular atrial fibrillation, the NOACs (rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban) are neither {{superior}} to nor worse than warfarin in preventing non-hemorrhagic stroke and systemic <b>embolic</b> events. They {{have a lower}} risk of intracranial bleeding compared to warfarin; however, dabigatran {{is associated with a}} higher risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.|$|E
25|$|In {{the initial}} stages after an <b>embolic</b> stroke, anticoagulation may be risky, as the damaged {{area of the brain}} is {{relatively}} prone to bleeding (hemorrhagic transformation). As a result, a clinical practice guideline by National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommends that anticoagulation should begin two weeks after stroke if no hemorrhage occurred.|$|E
25|$|Because an embolus {{arises from}} elsewhere, local therapy solves the problem only temporarily. Thus, {{the source of}} the embolus must be identified. Because the <b>embolic</b> {{blockage}} is sudden in onset, symptoms usually are maximal at the start. Also, symptoms may be transient as the embolus is partially resorbed and moves to a different location or dissipates altogether.|$|E
25|$|An <b>embolic</b> stroke {{refers to}} an {{arterial}} embolism (a blockage of an artery) by an embolus, a traveling particle or debris in the arterial bloodstream originating from elsewhere. An embolus is most frequently a thrombus, {{but it can also}} be a number of other substances including fat (e.g., from bone marrow in a broken bone), air, cancer cells or clumps of bacteria (usually from infectious endocarditis).|$|E
25|$|Keeping blood {{pressure}} below 140/90 mmHg is recommended. Anticoagulation can prevent recurrent ischemic strokes. Among people with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation can reduce stroke by 60% while antiplatelet agents can reduce stroke by 20%. However, a recent meta-analysis suggests harm from anticoagulation started early after an <b>embolic</b> stroke. Stroke prevention treatment for atrial fibrillation is determined {{according to the}} CHA2DS2–VASc score. The most widely used anticoagulant to prevent thromboembolic stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is the oral agent warfarin while a number of newer agents including dabigatran are alternatives which do not require prothrombin time monitoring.|$|E
25|$|Transcatheter {{arterial}} chemoembolization (TACE) {{is usually}} performed for unresectable tumors or {{as a temporary}} treatment while waiting for liver transplant. TACE is done by injecting an antineoplastic drug (e.g. cisplatin) mixed with a radio-opaque contrast (e.g. Lipiodol) and an <b>embolic</b> agent (e.g. Gelfoam) into the right or left hepatic artery via the groin artery. The goal of the procedure it to restrict the tumor’s vascular supply while supplying a targeted chemotherapeutic agent. TACE {{has been shown to}} increase survival and to downstage HCC in patients who exceed the Milan criteria for liver transplant. Patients who undergo the procedure may are followed with CT scans and may need additional TACE procedures if the tumor persists. As of 2005, multiple trials show objective tumor responses and slowed tumor progression but questionable survival benefit compared to supportive care; greatest benefit seen in people with preserved liver function, absence of vascular invasion, and smallest tumors. TACE is not suitable for big tumors (>8nbsp&cm), the presence of portal vein thrombus, tumors with a portal-systemic shunt, and patients with poor liver function.|$|E
25|$|Selective {{internal}} radiation therapy (SIRT) {{can be used}} to destroy the tumor from within (thus minimizing exposure to healthy tissue). Similar to TACE, this is a procedure in which an interventional radiologist selectively injects the artery or arteries supplying the tumor with a chemotherapeutic agent. The agent is typically Yttrium-90 (Y-90) incorporated into <b>embolic</b> microspheres that lodge in the tumor vasculature causing ischemia and delivering their radiation dose directly to the lesion. This technique allows for a higher, local dose of radiation to be delivered directly to the tumor while sparing normal healthy tissue. While not curative, patients have increased survival. No studies have been done to compare whether SIRT is superior to TACE in terms of survival outcomes, although retrospective studies suggest similar efficacy. There are currently two products available, SIR-Spheres and TheraSphere. The latter is an FDA approved treatment for primary liver cancer (HCC) which has been shown in clinical trials to increase the survival rate of low-risk patients. SIR-Spheres are FDA approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer but outside the US SIR-Spheres are approved for the treatment of any non-resectable liver cancer including primary liver cancer.|$|E
2500|$|In {{thrombotic}} stroke, a thrombus (blood clot) usually forms around atherosclerotic plaques. Since blockage of {{the artery}} is gradual, onset of symptomatic thrombotic strokes is slower {{than that of}} a hemorrhagic stroke. A thrombus itself (even if it does not completely block the blood vessel) can lead to an <b>embolic</b> stroke (see below) if the thrombus breaks off and travels in the bloodstream, at which point it is called an embolus. Two types of thrombosis can cause stroke: ...|$|E
2500|$|... β-blockers can be {{selective}} {{for either}} β1, β2 adrenergic receptor, {{or to be}} non-selective. By blocking β1 receptor {{it is possible to}} reduce heart rate, conduction of velocity and contractility. The blocking of β2 receptor promotes vascular smooth muscle contraction, which results in increase of peripheral resistance. Blockade of the β2 receptor effectively reduces the sympathetic activity, which results in reduce of the associated platelet-and coagulation activation. This is why a non-selective β-blocker treatment may result in a lower risk of both arterial and venous <b>embolic</b> events.|$|E
2500|$|Ischemic stroke {{occurs because}} of a loss of blood supply to part of the brain, {{initiating}} the ischemic cascade. Brain tissue ceases to function if deprived of oxygen for more than 60 to 90 seconds, and after approximately three hours will suffer irreversible injury possibly leading {{to the death of}} the tissue, i.e., infarction. (This is why fibrinolytics such as alteplase are given only until three hours since the onset of the stroke.) Atherosclerosis may disrupt the blood supply by narrowing the lumen of blood vessels leading to a reduction of blood flow, by causing the formation of blood clots within the vessel, or by releasing showers of small emboli through the disintegration of atherosclerotic plaques. <b>Embolic</b> infarction occurs when emboli formed elsewhere in the circulatory system, typically in the heart as a consequence of atrial fibrillation, or in the carotid arteries, break off, enter the cerebral circulation, then lodge in and block brain blood vessels. Since blood vessels in the brain are now blocked, the brain becomes low in energy, and thus it resorts into using anaerobic metabolism within the region of brain tissue affected by ischemia. Anaerobic metabolism produces less adenosine triphosphate (ATP) but releases a by-product called lactic acid. Lactic acid is an irritant which could potentially destroy cells since it is an acid and disrupts the normal acid-base balance in the brain. The ischemia area {{is referred to as the}} [...] "ischemic penumbra".|$|E
2500|$|Binge {{drinking}} is {{also associated with}} strokes and sudden death. Binge drinking {{increases the risk of}} stroke by 10 times. In countries where binge {{drinking is}} commonplace, rates of sudden death on the weekend in young adults and middle aged people increase significantly. The withdrawal phase after an episode of binge drinking is particularly associated with ischaemic stroke as well as subarachnoid haemorrhage and intracerebral haemorrhage in younger men. In individuals with an underlying cardiac disorder a binge on alcohol increases the risk of silent myocardial ischaemia as well as angina. Binge drinking has negative effects on metabolism, lipid profile, blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, blood pressure and vascular tone and is associated with <b>embolic</b> stroke and acute myocardial infarction. Due to these risks experts believe that it is extremely important to warn people of the risks of binge drinking. Binge-drinking by people otherwise considered to be light drinkers is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular problems and [...] Binge drinking increases cardiovascular toxicity due to its adverse effects on the electrical conduction system of the heart and the process of atherothrombosis. Excessive alcohol consumption is responsible for an average of 80,000 deaths in the U.S. each year1 and $223.5 billion in economic costs in 2006.2 More than half of these deaths and three-quarters of the economic costs are due to binge drinking1 and 2 (≥4 drinks for women; ≥5 drinks for men, per occasion).|$|E

5000|$|The broad term, [...] "stroke" [...] can {{be divided}} into three categories: brain ischemia, subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} and intracerebral hemorrhage. Brain ischemia can be further subdivided, by cause, into thrombotic, <b>embolic,</b> and hypoperfusion. [...] Thrombotic and <b>embolic</b> are generally focal or multifocal in nature while hypoperfusion affects the brain globally.|$|E
