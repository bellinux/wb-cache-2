Before the dancing, our {{problems}} were really <b>heavy</b> <b>to</b> bear. Dancing takes our minds away from our problems. Our bodies became more healthy. As for the judges, they may be impressed with us, seeing that we are being rehabilitated and this could help our case. We are being rehabilitated in a good way.|$|E
5|$|II Napoleon {{ordered the}} {{assemblage}} of over 5,000 artillery for transport through the pass, {{despite the fact}} that the pass was widely considered to be much too narrow, and the route too volatile and unstable, to allow any form of artillery, light or <b>heavy,</b> <b>to</b> come through. Thus, Napoleons military advisers warned him against this move, but he insisted on this presence of this great number of artillery.|$|E
5|$|Important {{information}} could be gained regarding {{the properties of}} superheavy nuclei by the synthesis of more livermorium isotopes, specifically those with a few neutrons {{more or less than}} the known ones – 286Lv, 287Lv, 288Lv, 289Lv, 294Lv, and 295Lv. This is possible because there are many reasonably long-lived isotopes of curium {{that can be used to}} make a target. The light isotopes can be made by fusing curium-243 with calcium-48. They would undergo a chain of alpha decays, ending at transactinide isotopes that are too light to achieve by hot fusion and too <b>heavy</b> <b>to</b> be produced by cold fusion.|$|E

5|$|On 19 June 1250, {{following}} the canonisation of Malcolm's wife Margaret by Pope Innocent IV, Margaret's remains were disinterred {{and placed in}} a reliquary. Tradition has it that as the reliquary was carried to the high altar of Dunfermline Abbey, past Malcolm's grave, it became too <b>heavy</b> <b>to</b> move. As a result, Malcolm's remains were also disinterred, and buried next to Margaret beside the altar.|$|E
5|$|Some {{concerns}} were raised that the Gemini spacecraft's heat shield {{would not have}} been able to protect it during the higher speed ballistic reentry associated with the trajectory that would have been required. NASA proposed using a thicker heat shield and more insulation to protect the spacecraft. This and several other modifications made the spacecraft too <b>heavy</b> <b>to</b> be launched by the Titan II rocket which was used for the original twelve Gemini missions, so several solid rocket motors would have been added to allow this additional mass to be flown.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other diurnal primates, {{which usually}} carry their infants with them, ruffed lemur mothers will stash their young by concealing {{them in the}} canopy foliage, leaving them to rest and sit quietly for several hours while she forages and {{performs}} other activities. Mothers continue to transport their offspring by mouth, moving them {{one at a time}} by grasping the infant's belly crosswise. This form of transport usually stops around 2.5 months of age when the infants become too <b>heavy</b> <b>to</b> carry.|$|E

5|$|A {{member of}} the genus Latrodectus in the family Theridiidae, the redback belongs in a clade with the black widow spider, with the katipo as its closest relative. A 2004 {{molecular}} study supports the redback's status as a distinct species, as does the unique abdomen-presenting behaviour of the male during mating. The close {{relationship between the two}} species is shown when mating: the male redback is able to successfully mate with a female katipo producing hybrid offspring. However, the male katipo is too <b>heavy</b> <b>to</b> mate with the female redback, as it triggers a predatory response in the female when it approaches the web, causing the female to eat it. There is evidence of interbreeding between female katipo and male redbacks in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Although closed, {{the line}} was not lifted, and was {{maintained}} as a long siding until 1972, {{on behalf of the}} Central Electricity Generating Board, who paid for its maintenance. This was to facilitate the maintenance of the stators from Keadby Power Station, which were too <b>heavy</b> <b>to</b> be transported over the bridge where the A161 road crossed the Stainforth and Keadby Canal. When required, the heavy haulage company Pickfords would move a stator by road to Ealand depot, to the south of Crowle. It would then be loaded onto the railway, and moved across the canal to Belton, where it would be transferred back to the road vehicle. The A161 road bridge was replaced by Lindsey County Council in 1970, and the complicated manoeuvres became unnecessary. Consequently, the rails were removed in 1972.|$|E
5|$|Ducks are {{medium-sized}} aquatic {{birds with}} broad bills, {{eyes on the}} side of the head, fairly long necks, short legs set far back on the body, and webbed feet. Males, known as drakes, are often larger than females (simply known as ducks) and are differently coloured in some breeds. Domestic ducks are omnivores, eating a variety of animal and plant materials such as aquatic insects, molluscs, worms, small amphibians, waterweeds, and grasses. They feed in shallow water by dabbling, with their heads underwater and their tails upended. Most domestic ducks are too <b>heavy</b> <b>to</b> fly, and they are social birds, preferring to live and move around together in groups. They keep their plumage waterproof by preening, a process that spreads the secretions of the preen gland over their feathers.|$|E

5|$|In 1986 Charig and Milner first {{suggested}} that its elongated snout with many finely serrated teeth indicated that Baryonyx was piscivorous (a fish-eater), speculating that it crouched on a riverbank and used its claw to gaff {{fish out of}} the water (similar to the modern grizzly bear). In 1984, Taquet pointed out that the spinosaurid snouts from Niger were {{similar to those of the}} modern gharial and suggested a behaviour similar to herons or storks. In 1997 Charig and Milner rejected their initial proposal that the articulation between the premaxilla and maxilla was mobile. In 1987 Andrew Kitchener disputed the piscivorous behaviour of Baryonyx and {{suggested that}} it would have been a scavenger, using its long neck to feed on the ground, its claws to break into a carcass, and its long snout (with nostrils far back for breathing) for investigating the body cavity. Kitchener argued that Baryonyx jaws and teeth were too weak to kill other dinosaurs and too <b>heavy</b> <b>to</b> catch fish, with too many adaptations for piscivory. According to R. E. H. Reid, a scavenged carcass would have been broken up by its predator and large animals capable of doing so—such as grizzly bears—are also capable of catching fish (at least in shallow water).|$|E
5|$|In Puerto Rico, heavy {{rainfall}} {{associated with the}} precursor tropical wave produced flooding in the southeastern portion of the island. On August25, a day before Alma developed, the precursor system brought high seas to the Atlantic coasts of Florida and Georgia; this resulted in small craft warnings from Daytona Beach, Florida to Savannah, Georgia. Additionally, the storm brought light precipitation to some areas of both states. As the storm traveled parallel to the East Coast of the United States, smalls crafts were also advised to remain in port between Edisto Island and {{the mouth of the}} Little River in South Carolina. Along the coast of that state, Alma brought gusty winds and <b>heavy</b> <b>to</b> excessive precipitation in some area, though no damage was reported.|$|E
5|$|Just before Godnow Swing Bridge, the {{northern}} soak drain {{crosses to the}} north side of the railway. As the canal approaches Ealand there are some large lakes to the north, which are now used for sailing. Crowle Bridge carries the A161 road over the railway and the canal, and Crowle railway station is sandwiched between the canal and the North Soak Drain. A little further east are the remains of Crowle railway bridge. It carried the Axholme Joint Railway over the canal, and consisted of four arches built from bricks, with a central swinging section, to allow keels to sail along the canal. The bridge was retained after the railway was closed in 1966, because stators from Keadby Power Station were too <b>heavy</b> <b>to</b> be transported over the A161 road bridge. The stators were carried by road to Ealand, loaded onto the railway, and crossed the bridge to Belton, where they were transferred back to a road vehicle. The process became unnecessary when Lindsey County Council rebuilt the A161 bridge in 1970, and the railway bridge was demolished in 1972.|$|E

5|$|Operating an {{air-breathing}} {{jet engine}} at velocities {{of up to}} Mach5.5 poses numerous engineering problems; several previous engines proposed by other designers have worked well as jet engines, but performed poorly as rockets. This engine design aims {{to be a good}} jet engine within the atmosphere, as well as being an excellent rocket engine outside; however, the conventional problem posed by operating at Mach5.5 has been that the air coming into the engine rapidly heats up as it is compressed into the engine; due to certain thermodynamic effects, this greatly reduces the thrust that can be produced by burning fuel. Attempts to avoid these issues has typically resulted in the engine being much heavier (scramjets/ramjets) or has greatly reduced the thrust generated (conventional turbojets/ramjets); in either of these scenarios, the end result would be an engine that possesses a poor thrust to weight ratio at high speeds, which in turn would be too <b>heavy</b> <b>to</b> assist much in reaching orbit.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{initially}} considered using {{a hydrogen}} bomb for the project, but the United States Air Force vetoed this idea {{due to the}} weight of such a device, {{as it would be}} too <b>heavy</b> <b>to</b> be propelled by the missile which would have been used. It was then decided to use a W25 warhead, a small, lightweight warhead with a relatively low 1.7 kiloton yield. By contrast, the Little Boy bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in 1945 had a yield of some 13–18 kilotons. The W25 would be carried by a rocket toward the hidden side of the Moon, near the terminator, where it would detonate on impact. The dust cloud resulting from the explosion would be lit by the Sun and therefore visible from Earth. According to Reiffel, the Air Force's progress in the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles would have made such a launch feasible by 1959.|$|E
5|$|Two shocks on July 25 that {{occurred}} {{within an hour}} of each other were felt throughout central California and caused pipeline damage south of Bakersfield and other minor building damage in several locations. Pre-existing ground disturbances were enhanced in Tejon Canyon, and landslides occurred at Caliente Creek Canyon, Oiler Canyon Grade, and on State Route 178 between Kernville and Bakersfield. A number of fires were initiated by the July 29 aftershock (intensity VII (Very strong)) and other severe damage was caused by it, especially to buildings that had already been damaged (including one in Bakersfield). The strongest aftershock in the sequence came on August 22 as a magnitude 5.8 event with a maximum perceived intensity of VIII (Severe). Damage was especially <b>heavy</b> <b>to</b> brick buildings in Bakersfield, and although only a few buildings collapsed outright, 90 of 264 buildings that the shock damaged needed to be brought down completely. Total damage from this event alone was estimated to be $10 million, with several injuries, and two additional deaths.|$|E
