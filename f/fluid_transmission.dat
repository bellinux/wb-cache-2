5000|$|Prior to electricity, various {{systems have}} been used for {{transmission}} of power across large distances. Chief among them were telodynamic (cable in motion), pneumatic (pressurized air), and hydraulic (pressurized <b>fluid)</b> <b>transmission.</b> [...] Cable cars were the most frequent example of telodynamic transmission, whose lines could extend for several miles for a single section. Pneumatic transmission was used for city power transmission systems in Paris, Birmingham, Rixdorf, Offenbach, Dresden and Buenos Aires {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century. Cities in the 19th century also used hydraulic transmission using high pressure water mains to deliver power to factory motors. London's system delivered 7000 hp ( [...] 5 megawatts) over a 180 mi network of pipes carrying water at 800 psi. These systems were replaced by cheaper and more versatile electrical systems, but by the end of the 19th century, city planners and financiers were well aware of the benefits, economics, and process of establishing power transmission systems.|$|E

40|$|<b>Fluid</b> power <b>transmission</b> {{for wind}} {{turbines}} is quietly gaining more ground/interest. The {{principle of the}} various concepts presented so far is to convert aerodynamic torque of the rotor blades into a pressurized fluid flow {{by means of a}} positive displacement pump. At {{the other end of the}} fluid power circuit, the pressurized flow is converted back to torque and speed by a hydraulic motor. The main advantage of a hydrostatic transmission over geared and direct drive systems is the possibility to vary the transmission ratio. Thus it is possible to operate with variable rotor speed (required for maximum energy extraction), whilst using a synchronous generator directly coupled to a grid, thereby eliminating the need for an AC frequency converter and a voltage transformer. Furthermore, hydraulic drives not only have a higher power density than electrical drives, but their use also allows for alternative arrangements of components. This provides the opportunity to significantly reduce the nacelle mass. Previous publications on <b>fluid</b> power <b>transmissions</b> for wind turbines have mostly been focused on the energy efficiency of the system, based on steady state simulations and mea- surements. Little has been mentioned about the dynamic behavior, especially regarding the inherent damping characteristics of <b>fluid</b> power <b>transmissions.</b> This paper presents a theoretical model of the <b>fluid</b> power <b>transmission</b> and the analysis of the influence of the main design parameters on the dynamic behavior of the system.
