5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with shots of New York City, and then has Hamasaki on a rooftop. Hamasaki is then singing the track with several different camera angles circulating her and the city. During the first verse, it has <b>her</b> <b>in</b> an apartment, sitting on a couch with a butterfly hair clip; this scene is used throughout the entire video. It then has three shots of <b>her</b> <b>in</b> different clothes; one with a brown leather jacket, brown wig and cowboy hat, the second with a red dress on, and the third with a black jacket and crop hair style. The shot with <b>her</b> <b>in</b> the brown leather jacket, brown wig and cowboy hat then shows her on a rooftop singing the song. The final pre-chorus and chorus has her driving through New York City, and has <b>her</b> <b>in</b> a pink dress watching the snow fall; it ends with <b>her</b> <b>in</b> the red dress, holding her hands out for the snow to fall. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album A Best (2016).|$|E

Mayer to cast <b>her</b> <b>in</b> more dramatic roles, and although he was reluctant, he cast <b>her</b> <b>in</b> the sophisticated comedy-drama I Live My Life (1935), directed by W.S. Van Dyke. It was well received by critics and made a larger profit than the studio had expected.|$|E
