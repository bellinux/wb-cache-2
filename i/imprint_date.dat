50|$|The first revenue stamps of Barbados {{were issued}} in 1916. The first issue {{consisted}} of contemporary King George V postage stamps overprinted Revenue, {{and some were}} also surcharged. This was followed by similar issues overprinted REVENUE, REVENUE ONLY or Revenue Only. Later in 1916, British embossed revenues were issued overprinted for Barbados. These issues (with several differences in design and watermark) continued to be used until 1934, and values from 3d to £100 were issued. From 1950 to 1972 embossed revenues denominated in decimal currency and with the country name incorporated in the design (instead of overprinted) were issued, with values from $4.80 to $480. These were replaced by a numeral design in 1977 which had high values from $25 to $500. From 1979 to 1985 a new design with the coat of arms {{of the country was}} issued with values up to $1000.

40|$|Kyo no mizu {{is a work}} by Akisato Ritou who {{is famous}} for Meisho zue. The constructions in the Imperial Palace and {{the system of the}} Heian-kyo capital are {{explained}} in Kyo no mizu. In this article, we classify its printings and examine circumstances of its publication. The first edition of Kyo no mizu was published by Ogawa Tazaemon, Noda Touhachi and Yoshinoya Tamehachi. Among their printings, we find books whose imprints were corrected by pasting a piece of paper dated April 1791. This strange correction was made in a situation as follows. First, the <b>imprint</b> <b>dated</b> January 1790 was printed. However, since there was a mistake in the representation of the year, it was corrected in the way mentioned above. After that, the corrected date was actually engraved and printed. Comparing this date with the record of reconstruction of the Imperial Palace burned down in 1788, we suppose that this work was published after the reconstruction had completed. The subsequent printing with the <b>imprint</b> <b>dated</b> 1791 had an alteration in the text, and the copyright of this work was passed to Kawachiya Tasuke, Kawachiya Genshichirou, Kawac hiya Kihee, Metogiya Souhachi and so on...|$|R
