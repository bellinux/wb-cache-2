We simulate this problem by using the diffusion-collision model to study non-native kinetic intermediate misfolding in a four-helix bundle protein. We find a limit {{on the size of}} the pairwise hydrophobic area loss in non-native intermediates, such that burying above this limit creates long-lasting non-native kinetic intermediates that would <b>disrupt</b> <b>folding</b> and prevent formation of the native state. Our study of misfolding suggests a method for limiting the production of misfolded kinetic intermediates for helical proteins and could, perhaps, lead to more efficient production of proteins in bulk...|$|R

These metamorphic rocks show polyphase deformation, mylonitic fabrics, and have been <b>disrupted,</b> <b>folded</b> and imbricated, and in places form tectonic inclusions in a serpentinite melange. Relatively low pressures and temperatures of 670 - 750 oC are suggested for the formation of the amphibolites, residual heat from the ophiolites being the dominant heat source. Metamorphism occurred during the Cenomanian-Turonian. The thrusts and other structural features are described.

5000|$|While the {{sequence}} that constitutes the 3'-UTR contributes greatly to gene expression, the structural {{characteristics of the}} 3'-UTR also play a large role. In general, longer 3'-UTRs correspond to lower expression rates since they often contain more miRNA and protein binding sites {{that are involved in}} inhibiting translation. [...] Human transcripts possess 3'-UTRs that are on average twice as long as other mammalian 3'-UTRs. This trend reflects the high level of complexity involved in human gene regulation. In addition to length, the secondary structure of the 3'-untranslated region also has regulatory functions. Protein factors can either aid or <b>disrupt</b> <b>folding</b> of the region into various secondary structures. The most common structure is a stem-loop, which provides a scaffold for RNA binding proteins and non-coding RNAs that influence expression of the transcript.|$|R

40|$|Protein misfolding is {{implicated in}} many diseases, {{including}} the serpinopathies. For the canonical inhibitory serpin alpha 1 -antitrypsin (A 1 AT), mutations {{can result in}} protein deficiencies leading to lung disease and polymerization prone mutants can accumulate in hepatocytes leading to liver disease. Using all-atom simulations based on the recently developed Bias Functional algorithm we elucidate how wild-type A 1 AT folds and how the disease-associated S (Glu 264 Val) and Z (Glu 342 Lys) mutations lead to misfolding. The deleterious Z mutation <b>disrupts</b> <b>folding</b> at an early stage, while the relatively benign S mutant shows late stage minor misfolding. A number of suppressor mutations ameliorate {{the effects of the}} Z mutation and simulations on these mutants help to elucidate the relative roles of steric clashes and electrostatic interactions in Z misfolding. These results demonstrate a striking correlation between atomistic events and disease severity and shine light on the mechanisms driving chains away from their correct folding routes...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a phage display system that provides a means to select variants of the IgG binding domain of peptostreptococcal protein L that fold from large combinatorial libraries. The premise underlying the selection scheme is that binding of protein L to IgG requires that the protein be properly folded. Using a combination of molecular biological and biophysical methods, we show that this assumption is valid. First, the phage selection procedure strongly selects against a point mutation in protein L that <b>disrupts</b> <b>folding</b> but {{is not in the}} IgG binding interface. Second, variants recovered from a library in which the first third of protein L was randomized are properly folded. The degree of sequence variation in the selected population is striking: the variants have as many as nine substitutions in the 14 residues that were mutagenized. The approach provides a selection for "foldedness" that is potentially applicable to any small binding protein...|$|R

Although many coding variants have been implicated in ID, identification of pathogenic non-coding regulatory variants has only been achieved in a few cases to date. We identified a duplication of a guanine on chromosome X, NC- 000023. 10 :g. 69665044 dupG 7 nucleotides upstream of the translational start site in the 5 ? untranslated region (UTR) of the known ID gene DLG 3 that encodes synapse-associated protein 102 (SAP 102). The dupG variant segregated with affected status in a large multigenerational family with non-syndromic X-linked ID and was predicted to <b>disrupt</b> <b>folding</b> of the mRNA. When tested on blood cells from the affected individuals, DLG 3 mRNA levels were not altered, however, DLG 3 /SAP 102 protein levels were. We also showed by dual luciferase reporter assay that the dupG variant interfered with translation. All currently known pathogenic DLG 3 variants are predicted to be null, however the dupG variant likely leads to only a modest reduction of SAP 102 levels accounting for the milder phenotype seen in this family...|$|R
40|$|In {{the use of}} non-antibody {{proteins}} as affinity reagents, diversity {{has generally}} been derived from oligonucleotide-encoded random amino acids. Although specific binders of high-affinity have been selected from such libraries, random oligonucleotides often encode stop codons and amino acid combinations that affect protein folding. Recently {{it has been shown}} that specific antibody binding loops grafted into heterologous proteins can confer the specific antibody binding activity to the created chimeric protein. In this paper, we examine the use of such antibody binding loops as diversity elements. We first show that we are able to graft a lysozyme-binding antibody loop into green fluorescent protein (GFP), creating a fluorescent protein with lysozyme-binding activity. Subsequently we have developed a PCR method to harvest random binding loops from antibodies and insert them at predefined sites in any protein, using GFP as an example. The majority of such GFP chimeras remain fluorescent, indicating that binding loops do not <b>disrupt</b> <b>folding.</b> This method can be adapted to the creation of other nucleic acid libraries where diversity is flanked by regions of relative sequence conservation, and its availability sets the stage for the use of antibody loop libraries as diversity elements for selection experiments...|$|R
40|$|We {{report that}} the {{cationic}} porphyrin TmPyP 4, which is known mainly as a DNA G-quadruplex stabilizer, unfolds an unusually stable all purine RNA G-quadruplex (M 3 Q) that {{is located in the}} 5 ′-UTR of MT 3 -MMP mRNA. When the interaction between TmPyP 4 and M 3 Q was monitored by UV spectroscopy a 22 -nm bathochromic shift and 75 % hypochromicity of the porphin major Soret band was observed indicating direct binding of the two molecules. TmPyP 4 <b>disrupts</b> <b>folded</b> M 3 Q in a concentration-dependent fashion as was observed by circular dichroism (CD), 1 D 1 H NMR and native gel electrophoresis. Additionally, when TmPyP 4 is present during the folding process it inhibits the M 3 Q RNA from adopting a G-quadruplex structure. Using a dual reporter gene construct that contained the M 3 Q sequence alone or the entire 5 ′-UTR of MT 3 -MMP mRNA, we report here that TmPyP 4 can relieve the inhibitory effect of the M 3 Q G-quadruplex. However, the same concentrations of TmPyP 4 failed to affect translation of a mutated construct. Thus, TmPyP 4 has the ability to unfold an RNA G-quadruplex of extreme stability and modulate activity of a reporter gene presumably via the disruption of the G-quadruplex...|$|R
40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common inherited diseases and is caused by a mutation in a membrane protein, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). This protein serves as a chloride channel and regulates the viscosity of mucus lining the ducts of a number of organs. Although much has been learned about the consequences of mutations on the energy landscape and the resulting <b>disrupted</b> <b>folding</b> pathway of CFTR, a level of understanding needed to correct the misfolding has not been achieved. The most common mutations of CFTR are located in one of two nucleotide binding domains, namely, the nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD 1). We model NBD 1 using a nested graph model. The vertices in the lowest layer each represent an atom in the structure of an amino acid residue, while the vertices in the mid layer each represent the residue. The vertices in the top layer each represent a subdomain of the nucleotide binding domain. We use this model to quantify the effects of a single point mutation on the protein domain. We compare the wildtype structure with eight of the most common mutations. The graph-theoretic model provides insight into how a single point mutation can have such profound structural consequences...|$|R
40|$|Aquaporin- 2 (AQP 2) is the {{vasopressin}} sensitive {{water channel}} that regulates water reabsorbtion in the distal nephron collecting duct. Inherited AQP 2 mutations that <b>disrupt</b> <b>folding</b> lead to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus by targeting newly synthesized protein for degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). During synthesis, {{a subset of}} WT AQP 2 is covalently modified by N-linked glycosylation at residue Asn 123. To investigate the affect of glycosylation, we expressed WT and four NDI-related mutants in Xenopus laevis oocytes and compared stability of glycosylated and nonglycosylated isoforms. In all constructs, approximately 15 - 20 % of newly synthesized AQP 2 was covalently modified by N-linked glycosylation. At steady state, however, core glycosylated WT protein was nearly undetectable, whereas all mutants were found predominantly in the glycosylated form (60 - 70 %). Pulse chase metabolic labeling studies revealed that glycosylated isoforms of mutant AQP 2 were significantly more stable than their non-glycosylated counterparts. For non-glycosylated isoforms, the half-life of WT AQP 2 was significantly greater (> 48 h) than mutant AQP 2 (T 126 M 4. 1 ± 1. 0 h, A 147 T 4. 2 ± 0. 60 h, C 181 W 4. 5 ± 0. 50 h, R 187 C 6. 8 ± 1. 2 h).

40|$|Rheological {{forces in}} the blood trigger the {{unfolding}} of von Willebrand factor (VWF) and its A 2 domain, exposing the scissile bond for proteolysis by ADAMTS 13. Under quiescent conditions, the scissile bond is hidden by the folded structure due to the stabilisation provided by the structural specialisations of the VWF A 2 domain, a vicinal disulphide bond, a calcium binding site and a N 1574 -glycan. The reduced circulating high MW multimers of VWF in patients with type 2 A von Willebrand disease (VWD) {{may be associated with}} mutations within the VWF A 2 domain and this is attributed to enhanced ADAMTS 13 proteolysis. We investigated 11 VWF A 2 domain variants identified in patients with type 2 A VWD. In recombinant full-length VWF, enhanced ADAMTS 13 proteolysis was detected for all of the expressed variants in the presence of urea-induced denaturation. A subset of the FLVWF variants displayed enhanced proteolysis in the absence of urea. The mechanism of enhancement was investigated using a novel VWF A 2 domain FRET construct. In the absence of induced unfolding, 7 / 8 of the expressed mutants exhibited a <b>disrupted</b> domain <b>fold,</b> causing spatial separation of the N- and C- termini. Three of the type 2 A mutants were not secreted when studied within the VWF A 2 domain FRET construct. Urea denaturation revealed for all 8 secreted mutants reduced unfolding cooperativity and stability of the VWF A 2 domain. As folding stability was progressively disrupted, proteolysis by ADAMTS 13 increased. Due to the range of folding stabilities and wide distribution of VWF A 2 domain mutations studied, we conclude that these mutations <b>disrupt</b> regulated <b>folding</b> of the VWF A 2 domain. They enhance unfolding by inducing separation of N- and C-termini, thereby promoting a more open conformation that reveals its binding sites for ADAMTS 13 and the scissile bond...|$|R

PDI is a molecular chaperone for estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). Our present data show in breast cancer cells that S-glutathionylation of PDI interferes with its chaperone activity and abolishes its capacity to form a complex with ERα. Such drug treatment also reverses estradiol-induced upregulation of c-Myc, cyclinD 1, and P 21 Cip, gene products involved in cell proliferation. Expression of an S-glutathionylation refractory PDI mutant diminishes the toxic effects of PABA/NO.

50|$|One {{observation}} {{in line with}} this hypothesis is chaperone buffering, where the activity of a chaperone masks or “buffers” deleterious or destabilizing mutations in a client protein. In Drosophila melanogaster, reduced activity of hsp90 resulted in deficient phenotypes caused by mutations in developmental pathways. Hsp70 in Drosophila was also shown to buffer deleterious mutations. Similar results have been shown in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis thaliana. Work in Escherichia coli showed that the GroES/GroEL system (aka hsp10 and hsp60 respectively) similarly buffered the effect of destabilizing mutations in a phosphotriesterase. The mutation <b>disrupted</b> the <b>fold</b> of the protein, but conferred an increase in efficiency upon chaperone-assisted folding.

50|$|Pardaxin initiates caspase-dependent and caspase-independent {{apoptosis}} {{in human}} cervical carcinoma cells. Pardaxin triggers {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS). ROS production <b>disrupts</b> protein <b>folding</b> and induces the unfolded protein response (UPR). This causes stress on the endoplasmic reticulum, which releases calcium. This leads {{to an increase in}} mitochondrial calcium, dropping its membrane potential. The pore permeability changes, and Cytochrome c (Cyt c) is released. Cyt c activates the caspase chain that leads to apoptosis. ROS also activates the JNK pathway. JNK is phosphorylated, which leads to the phosphorylation of AP-1 (transcription factor consisting of cFOS and Cjun). This results in the activation of caspases as well. ROS also causes a caspase independent pathway that results in apoptosis. When the mitochondrial membrane potential changes, apoptosis-inducing factors (AIFs) are also released. These trigger apoptosis when they enter the nucleus, not needing to involve caspases.|$|R
