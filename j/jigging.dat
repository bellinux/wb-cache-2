5|$|Bigfin reef squids {{are one of}} {{the most}} commercially {{important}} squid species, and are widely consumed as human food. They are usually caught in large numbers by trawling, seine fishing, or fixed net traps. In small-scale fishing, they are caught by <b>jigging,</b> drive-in nets, slingshot-driven spearguns, or with squid pots.|$|E
5|$|Fishing {{operations}} for bigfin reef squids (particularly in <b>jigging)</b> are usually done {{at night and}} utilise bright lights, taking advantage of their attraction to illumination. They are especially abundant during the full moon and in foggy weather. Populations of bigfin reef squids are not seasonal, {{and they can be}} fished throughout the year. They are also used as fish bait in hook and line fishing.|$|E
25|$|Cod jiggers – use single jigger {{machines}} {{and do not}} use lights to attract the fish. The fish are attracted by the <b>jigging</b> motion and artificial bait.|$|E
50|$|Some {{types of}} <b>jigs</b> are also called as a {{templates}} or guides. <b>Jigs</b> include machining <b>jigs,</b> woodworking <b>jigs</b> (e.g. tapering <b>jig),</b> welders' <b>jigs,</b> jewellers' <b>jigs,</b> and many others.|$|R
5000|$|Traditional {{dances and}} tunes include reels (...) , hornpipes ( [...] with swung eighth notes), and <b>jigs</b> (double and single <b>jigs</b> are in [...] time), {{as well as}} {{imported}} waltzes, mazurkas, polkas, and highlands or barndances (a sort of Irish version of the Scottish strathspey). <b>Jigs</b> come in various other forms for dancing - the slip <b>jig</b> and hop <b>jig</b> or single <b>jig</b> are commonly written in [...] time, the slide in [...] (The dance the hop <b>jig</b> is no longer performed {{under the auspices of}} An Coimisiun.) The forms of <b>jig</b> danced in hardshoe are known as double or treble <b>jigs</b> (for the doubles/trebles performed with the tip of the hardshoe), and the <b>jigs</b> danced in ghillies are known as light <b>jigs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Hop <b>jigs</b> are {{the fastest}} of all <b>jigs</b> next to light <b>jigs,</b> but the term hop <b>jig</b> causes some confusion, {{as some people}} use it for a single <b>jig,</b> while others use this term {{to refer to a}} tune in [...] time.|$|R
25|$|Jiggers – {{there are}} two types of jiggers: {{specialised}} squid jiggers which work mostly in the southern hemisphere and smaller vessels using <b>jigging</b> techniques in the northern hemisphere mainly for catching cod.|$|E
25|$|While {{bottom fishing}} or <b>jigging</b> {{can be done}} from small boats, it was long thought that {{effective}} trolling required speeds of five to ten knots, a speed well out {{of the range of}} someone paddling. However, the discovery that fish could be taken at much lesser speeds has increased the popularity of kayak fishing.|$|E
25|$|Fish {{are caught}} by <b>jigging.</b> The hunter cuts a square {{hole in the}} ice on the lake and fishes using a fish lure and spear. Instead of using a hook on a line, Inuit use a fake fish {{attached}} to the line. They lower it {{into the water and}} move it around as if it is real. When the live fish approach it, they spear the fish before it has a chance to eat the fake fish.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} styles of <b>jig</b> {{available}} commercially. Fundamentally, all <b>jigs</b> {{are similar in}} that they allow the user to clamp the blade or tool in some way. The <b>jig</b> then has some means of referencing the clamped blade to the grinding or honing apparatus so that the bevel angle is maintained. One of the more common approaches {{is to have the}} <b>jig</b> ride on a roller. These types of <b>jigs</b> are usually used with a sharpening stone or plate, such as a waterstone, oilstone or diamond abrasive surface. Other types of <b>jigs</b> are used to present the blade to the wheel of a grinder. There are generally two types of hand sharpening <b>jigs,</b> push <b>jigs</b> and side to side <b>jigs.</b> Push <b>jigs</b> run perpendicular to the length of the stone and a side to side <b>jig</b> runs with the blade parallel to the length of the stone.|$|R
5000|$|Treble <b>jigs</b> (also {{called the}} hard or heavy <b>jig)</b> are {{performed}} in hard shoes, {{and also to}} a [...] time metre. They are characterized by stomps, trebles, and clicks. Many set dances are performed in treble <b>jig</b> time, a few being Drunken Gauger, Blackthorn Stick, The Three Sea Captains, and St Patrick's Day. Two types of treble <b>jigs</b> are performed at feiseanna: the traditional and non-traditional (slow) treble <b>jigs.</b> Beginners will do a treble <b>jig</b> at traditional speed (92 bpm), while more advanced dancers will dance the non-traditional (slow) treble <b>jig</b> at 72 bpm.|$|R
25|$|Squid jiggers – have {{single or}} double drum jigger winches lined along the rails around the vessel. Strong lamps, up to 5000 W each, {{are used to}} attract the squid. These are {{arranged}} 50–60 centimetres apart, either as one row in {{the centre of the}} vessel, or two rows, one on each side. As the squid are caught they are transferred by chutes to the processing plant of the vessel. The <b>jigging</b> motion can be produced mechanically by the shape of the drum or electronically by adjustment to the winch motor. Squid jiggers are often used during the day as midwater trawlers and during the night as jiggers.|$|E
25|$|With the {{combining}} of {{the constituent}} firms, Allis-Chalmers offered {{a wide array}} of pyrometallurgic equipment, such as blast furnaces and converters for roasting, smelting, and refining; ore milling equipment, various kinds of crushers and pulverizers, including stamp mills, roller mills, ball mills, conical mills, rod mills, and <b>jigging</b> mills; cyanidation mills and other concentration mills; hoisting engines; cars, including , slag cars, and general mine cars; briquetting plants; and the pumps, tanks, boilers, compressors, hydraulic accumulators, pipes, valves, sieves, and conveyors needed within these products. Like other firms that build capital equipment for industrial corporations, it also supplied consulting, erecting, and training services, such as helping a mining company to design a plant, to build its buildings and set up its machinery, and to teach the employees how to use and maintain it.|$|E
25|$|The {{conventional}} reel or trolling reel {{is similar}} to the baitcasting reel. There are two types of trolling reels, star drag reels and lever drag reels. Star drag reels are like baitcasters, but you move a little lever to put it into free spool. They have a star drag and you have to keep your thumb on them to keep off backlash. The lever drag reel uses the drag to put itself into free spool. It is very difficult to cast a conventional reel, most oven line is dropped behind a boat and left to drift. Conventional reels are for really big fish and are usually used offshore. They are designed for trolling but can also be used for butterfly <b>jigging</b> and Deep-sea fishing ("deep drop"). They are mounted on short rods.|$|E
5000|$|Reel, slip <b>jig,</b> hornpipe, and <b>jig</b> are {{all types}} of Irish stepdances and are also types of Irish {{traditional}} music. These fall into two broad categories based on the shoes worn: hard shoe and soft shoe dances. Reels, which are in [...] or [...] time, and slip <b>jigs,</b> which are in [...] time and {{considered to be the}} lightest and most graceful of the dances, are soft shoe dances. Hornpipes, which can be in [...] or [...] time, are danced in hard shoes. Three <b>jigs</b> are danced in competition; the light <b>jig,</b> the single jig,which is also called the Hop <b>jig,</b> and the treble <b>jig,</b> which is also called double <b>jig.</b> Light and single <b>jigs</b> are in [...] time, and are soft shoes dances, while the treble <b>jig</b> is hard shoe, danced in a slow [...] The last type of <b>jig</b> is the slip <b>jig,</b> which is danced in [...] time. There are many dances, which steps vary between schools. The traditional set dances (danced in hardshoe) like St. Patrick's Day and the Blackbird, among others, are the only dances that all schools have the same steps.|$|R
50|$|<b>Jig</b> borers {{are limited}} to working {{materials}} that are still soft enough to be bored. Often a <b>jig</b> is hardened; for a <b>jig</b> borer this requires the material to be bored first and then hardened, which may introduce distortion. The <b>jig</b> grinder was developed as a machine with the precision of the <b>jig</b> borer, but capable of working materials in their hardened state.|$|R
5000|$|Before the <b>jig</b> borer was developed, hole center {{location}} {{had been}} accomplished either with layout (either quickly-but-imprecisely or painstakingly-and-precisely) or with drill <b>jigs</b> (themselves made with painstaking-and-precise layout). The <b>jig</b> borer was invented to expedite {{the making of}} drill <b>jigs,</b> but it helped to {{eliminate the need for}} drill <b>jigs</b> entirely by making quick precision directly available for the parts that the <b>jigs</b> would have been created for. The revolutionary underlying principle was that advances in machine tool control that expedited the making of <b>jigs</b> were fundamentally a way to expedite the cutting process itself, for which the <b>jig</b> was just a means to an end. Thus the <b>jig</b> borer's development helped advance machine tool technology toward later NC and CNC development. The <b>jig</b> borer was a logical extension of manual machine tool technology that began to incorporate some then-novel concepts that would become routine with NC and CNC control, such as: ...|$|R
25|$|The winding {{engine was}} the source of power for hauling miners, {{equipment}} and coal up and down the shaft in a cage, the top of the shaft being in the adjacent heapstead, which encloses the frame holding the wheel around which the hoist cable travels. Inside the Heapstead, tubs of coal from the shaft were weighed on a weighbridge, then tipped onto <b>jigging</b> screens, which sifted the solid lumps from small particles and dust - these were then sent along the picking belt, where pickers, often women, elderly or disabled people or young boys (i.e. workers incapable of mining), would separate out unwanted stone, wood and rubbish. Finally, the coal was tipped onto waiting railway wagons below, while the unwanted waste sent to the adjacent heap by an external conveyor.|$|E
25|$|Some {{recreational}} fishing groups are also promoting a catch and release {{practice for the}} giant trevally, with this becoming an increasingly popular option for charter boat operators, who have also begun to tag giant trevally for scientific purposes. At large sizes, the species {{is more likely to}} be ciguatoxic, so if the fish is kept, it must be disposed of or sent to a taxidermist if it is a trophy fish. A catch and release approach has also been adopted by operators outside of Hawaii, with Australian operators who target the species by popping and <b>jigging</b> rarely keeping any fish. Careful fish handling techniques have also been implemented by anglers so as not to damage the fish; such techniques include supporting the fish's weight, using barbless single, rather than treble, hooks and restricting the time the fish spends out the water to a minimum.|$|E
25|$|When the Lucy Tongue Level was {{completed}} in 1869, its entrance was below the ore hoppers {{at the foot of}} the incline from the Low Horse Level. A water-powered incline was built to take the ore up to those hoppers, though this involved a considerable amount of reorganisation in the area. Labour shortages in 1870 led to further mechanisation of the labour-intensive ore washing. A new oscillating jaw crusher eliminated the need for initial hand-knocking of the ore, and was powered by a high-pressure water turbine. Hotching tubs, even when mechanised, still needed constant supervision, and were replaced by newly-available automated fixed-sieve <b>jigging</b> machines. These still involved forcing water up and down through the bed of ore, but the sieves, covered with a three-inch (76mm) layer of galena, were stationary; material of the same density passed through the bed but lighter material was washed into the next sieve down the line. They were very effective and enabled a complete separation of galena and gangue.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>jig</b> (port) {{is a form}} of lively folk {{dance in}} {{compound}} metre, as well as the accompanying dance tune. It developed in 16th-century England, and was quickly adopted on the Continent where it eventually became the final movement of the mature Baroque dance suite (the French gigue; Italian and Spanish giga). Today it is most associated with Irish dance music, Scottish country dance and the Métis people in Canada. <b>Jigs</b> were originally in duple compound metre, (e.g., [...] time), but have been adapted to a variety of time signatures, by which they are often classified into groups, including light <b>jigs,</b> slip <b>jigs,</b> single <b>jigs,</b> double <b>jigs,</b> and treble <b>jigs.</b>|$|R

25|$|Yellowtail scad {{are a major}} species {{targeted}} by fisheries throughout the species range. Worldwide catch data are not available, although the FAO has catch data from Saudi Arabia showing 933 tonnes of the species was taken in 2001; an increase from 2000's catch of 875 tonnes. In Malaysia and presumably other South East Asian countries, the species makes up {{a high percentage of}} the pelagic catch. The fishery appears to be seasonal in some areas, with demersal species such as serranids and lutjanids making up the bulk of the catch most of the year while pelagics such as A. mate and scombrids make up the bulk of the catch between January and April. In other areas such as the Gulf of Thailand, it is taken year round. The species is taken by a variety of fishing methods including beach seines, gill netting, as well as hook and line methods involving <b>jigging</b> with lures. In parts of South East Asia, the yellowtail scad is a highly valued seafood prepared by boiling, steaming and frying. It may also by dried and salted to preserve the flesh.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the design and}} development of a prototype of a knee surgery cutting <b>jig,</b> the <b>jig</b> holder, and the <b>jig</b> injection mold by Rapid Prototyping (RP). The {{aim of this study}} is to design a <b>jig</b> and a <b>jig</b> holder that allow surgeons to correctly, precisely, and consistently perform knee replacement surgery. The design concept for the surgery <b>jig</b> and <b>jig</b> holder was selected using the Pugh method with medical-grade 316 L stainless steel for material fabrication. A rapid prototype model was built directly from its CAD model in stereo lithography (STL) format by using the Fused Deposition Method (FDM). MasterCAM and Moldflow simulation were performed to generated G-codes and a possibility of <b>jig</b> fabrication using Metal Injection Molding (MIM), respectively. The Moldflow result provided an enhanced interpretation of the injection mold design. A conceptual mold design was again developed by the FDM. The prototype of the cutting <b>jig</b> and its holder underwent a machining process. The prototype was then tested on dummy bones to determine the functional performance and efficiency of the said prototype. Results indicated an increase in cutting accuracy and cutting time compared with computer-assisted total knee surgery without the <b>jig</b> system...|$|R

2500|$|The Tormin mine, on [...] the Western Cape of South Africa's coastline, {{provides}} an unique ocean beach feature, which exposes the resource to wave and tidal conditions {{that result in}} a natural <b>jigging</b> effect. Large proportions of the quartz and light heavies waste material are removed by the ocean tidal action, resulting in run of mine (ROM) grades as high as 86% heavy mineral concentrate (HMC).|$|E
2500|$|Trolling baits and lures {{are either}} {{tied with a}} knot, such as the {{improved}} clinch knot, or connected with a tiny safety pin-like device called a [...] "snap" [...] onto the fishing line which is in turn connected to the reel. The reel {{is attached to a}} rod. The motion is of the lure is made by winding line back on to the reel, by sweeping the fishing rod, <b>jigging</b> movements with the fishing rod, or by trolling behind a moving boat. Lures can be contrasted with artificial flies, commonly called flies by fly fishers, which either float on the water surface, slowly sink or float underwater, in imitation some form of insect fish food. However some flies, such as the trolling tandem streamer fly, are designed for trolling behind a moving boat.|$|E
2500|$|After 1825 a horse tramway {{led from}} the High Horse Level round {{the edge of the}} marsh to a picking floor {{near the top of the}} Swart Beck. Here, pieces of waste rock were {{separated}} from ore by hand and dumped. The ore was then crushed, originally by hand using wide-headed hammers (called buckers). A crushing mill was erected in about 1827, probably using a roller crusher powered by a water wheel, although this still required ore to be broken by hand (known as [...] "knocking") into pieces less than [...] in size. Water was also used to separate the galena from the gangue in hotching tubs. These worked by <b>jigging</b> the crushed mixed ore up and down in a tub of water; the heavier galena worked its way to the bottom of the swirling mixture and the lighter gangue to the top. There were probably no slime pits at this date, so very fine lead ore and mud in the water polluted the beck and the lake. Until 1828 the concentrated ore was taken to the High Wath smelter at Caldbeck.|$|E
