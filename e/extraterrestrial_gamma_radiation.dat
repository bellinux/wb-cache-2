40|$|Abstract. <b>Gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> {{induced changes}} in the optical and {{electrical}} properties of tellurium dioxide (TeO 2) thin films, prepared by thermal evaporation, have been studied in detail. The optical characterization of the as-deposited thin films {{and that of the}} thin films exposed to various levels of <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> dose clearly show that the optical bandgap decreases with increase in the <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> dose up to a certain dose. At <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> doses above this value, however, the optical bandgap has been found to increase. On the other hand, the current vs voltage plots for the as-deposited thin films and those for the thin films exposed to various levels of <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> dose show that the current increases with the <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> dose up to a certain dose and that the value of this particular dose depends upon the thickness of the film. The current has, however, been found to decrease with further increase in <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> dose. The observed changes in both the optical and electrical properties indicate that TeO 2 thin films can be used as the real time <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> dosimeter up to a certain dose, a quantity that depends upon the thickness of the film...|$|R
40|$|Several {{positron}} emitting nuclides with {{applications in}} PET, such as 76 Br, 124 I, 110 mIn and 86 Y, also emit <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> in their decays. Measured coincidences between annihilation photons and this cascade <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> are essentially true coincidences {{and the standard}} PET corrections do not account for them. We investigated the performance of 76 Br in 2 D and 3 D PET, {{the effect of the}} <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> emitted by 76 Br on quantitative accuracy and the distribution of cascade <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> coincidences in 2 D and 3 D PET sinograms. A correction method for cascade <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> coincidences was implemented and evaluated. Count rate linearity was affected by the <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> from the 76 Br decay. Spatial resolution and sphere recovery were slightly worse for 76 Br compared to 18 F. Correction for cascade <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> coincidences by subtraction of a linear projection tail fit improved total correction accuracy to similar values as for positron-only emitters such as 18 F, and improved image contrast significantly. 1...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Campylobacter spp. {{is a major}} food borne {{pathogen}} {{and shows}} resistance towards <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation.</b> In the present study, effect of <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> was assessed on the indigenous strains of Campylobacter spp. inoculated in food and water samples. METHODS: Campylobacter spp. were isolated from river water and faeces of various birds and animals. The growth rate was studied for these isolates by propagating them in Kapadnis-Baseri medium. The survival of Campylobacter spp. inoculated in food and water samples was tested after exposing them to <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation.</b> RESULTS: The isolates survived well in meat and milk samples and were sensitive to 1. 8 KGy dose of <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation,</b> which lies with in the FDA limit. The effect of radiation on Campylobacter spp. varied with the species {{and the type of}} food.

Ten kGy dose level of <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> and 20 % lime were the optimum treatments to reduce the microbial load of sludge namely, total bacterial counts, total sporeformers, Enterococcus faecalis, total coliform, Aeromonas hydrophila and total fungi. A pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and Pseudomonas fluorescens as a biological agent in controlling certain soil borne diseases and reducing the toxicity of heavy metals comparing with 20 % lime and 10 kGy <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> using 4 % sludge application {{and its effect on}} yield of cowpea components.

40|$|Narrow {{genetic base}} is a main problem {{hindering}} {{the progress of}} physic nut breeding. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare the effects of different levels of <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> on germination percentage, survival percentage and growth of five physic nut genotypes. The seeds were treated with six levels of <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> (0, 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 Gy) and the 5 x 6 treatment combinations were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Data were recorded for germination percentage, survival percentage at 15 Days After Germination (DAG) (GR 50 (15)) and survival percentage at 30 DAG (LD 50 (30)). As the seedlings did not survive at 600, 800 and 1000 Gy, these treatments were deleted from the successive evaluations of plant height, stem diameter and leaf number. Higher doses of <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> resulted in the significant reductions in germination percentage, survival percentage and plant height. The germination percentages were from 4. 0 % for 1000 Gy to 82. 5 % for 0 Gy. The seeds treated with <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> higher than 600 Gy resulted in complete mortality. Difference among genotypes was not significant for these characters.

The polymer thin films with two {{different}} thicknesses (30 and 100 nm) were irradiated at room temperature with different <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> doses (up to 25 kGy). Optical properties of the material were investigated with FTIR and UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. Results show that <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> does not degrade substantially the thin-film material, suggesting that a crosslink effect may be occurring. The characteristic absorption peak of MEH-PPV, around 500 nm is shifted to shorter wavelengths with the increase of <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> doses for both thicknesses samples. The 30 -nm-thick samples showed a larger variation absorbance at a specific wavelength and a larger peak shift.

40|$|The basidiomycetous fungus Cryptococcus neoformans {{has been}} known to be highly {{radiation}} resistant and has been found in fatal radioactive environments such as the damaged nuclear reactor at Chernobyl. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the radiation resistance phenotype of C.  neoformans, we identified genes affected by <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> through genome-wide transcriptome analysis and characterized their functions. We found that genes involved in DNA damage repair systems were upregulated in response to <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation.</b> Particularly, deletion of recombinase RAD 51 and two DNA-dependent ATPase genes, RAD 54 and RDH 54, increased cellular susceptibility to both <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> and DNA-damaging agents. A variety of oxidative stress response genes were also upregulated. Among them, sulfiredoxin contributed to <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> resistance in a peroxiredoxin/thioredoxin-independent manner. Furthermore, we found that genes involved in molecular chaperone expression, ubiquitination systems, and autophagy were induced, whereas genes involved in the biosynthesis of proteins and fatty acids/sterols were downregulated. Most importantly, we discovered a number of novel C.  neoformans genes, the expression of which was modulated by <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure, and their deletion rendered cells susceptible to <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure, as well as DNA damage insults. Among these genes, we found that a unique transcription factor containing the basic leucine zipper domain, named Bdr 1, served as a regulator of the <b>gamma</b> <b>radiation</b> resistance of C.  neoformans by controlling expression of DNA repair genes, and its expression was regulated by the evolutionarily conserved DNA damage response protein kinase Rad 53. Taken together, the current transcriptome and functional analyses contribute {{to the understanding of the}} unique molecular mechanism of the radiation-resistant fungus C.  neoformans...|$|R
