5|$|Reading {{was a major}} {{staging point}} on the old Bath Road (A4) from London to Avonmouth, near Bristol. This road still carries local traffic, but has now been {{replaced}} for long distance traffic by the M4 motorway, which closely skirts the borough and serves it with three junctions, J10-J12. Other main roads serving Reading include the A33, A327, A329, A4074 and A4155. Within Reading there is the Inner <b>Distribution</b> <b>Road</b> (IDR), a ring road for local traffic. The IDR is linked with the M4 by the A33 relief road. National Express Coaches run out of Reading Coachway, at Junction 12 of the M4. The Thames is crossed by both Reading and Caversham road bridges, while several road bridges cross the Kennet, the oldest surviving {{one of which is}} High Bridge.|$|E

These in turn were retired in 1968, when diesel buses took over. In 1970, Broad Street was closed to all traffic except buses and for access, with through traffic diverted onto a one-way system and {{the first phase of}} the town's Inner <b>Distribution</b> <b>Road.</b>|$|E

25|$|Planners {{should set}} a policy {{regarding}} the character being sought for each urban area, {{and the level}} of traffic should then be managed to produce the desired effect, in a safe manner. This would result in towns with a lattice of environmentally planned areas joined by a road hierarchy, a network of <b>distribution</b> <b>roads,</b> with longer-distance traffic being directed around and away from these areas, rather like an interior would be designed with corridors serving a multitude of rooms.|$|R
40|$|When {{applying}} the `sustainable safe' traffic concept {{in rural areas}} in The Netherlands, one is confronted by problems which are in part unique to these locations. The first step of this report is to define these problems. The standard `sustainable safe' classification and optimization of the road network, both for motorized and cycle traffic, {{is used as a}} basis for the infrastructural approach. Solutions are proposed for those problems specific to rural areas which largely result from the relatively high incidence of long and narrow roads with low intensities of use. It is considered how provisions can be made to cater to local traffic which is not able to use the regional <b>distribution</b> <b>roads.</b> The report investigates when, and to what degree, <b>distribution</b> <b>roads</b> are also required for inside built-up areas. For the `speed control' subject, the report discusses an approach by means of: (1) infrastructural measures such as roundabouts and traffic humps; (2) measures to influence the road user behaviour such as police enforcement and information campaigns; and (3) by means of future possibilities of speed control devices. The report describes how the public transport can make an important contribution to a `sustainable safe' traffic and transport system. The report concludes that suitable solutions are feasible for rural areas in order to enable the introduction of that system...|$|R

50|$|Most of {{the road}} is single carriageway, apart from the section through Bracknell, and in central Reading. In Reading the road is dualled where it forms the Inner <b>Distribution</b> <b>Road.</b> In Bracknell the A329 {{originally}} ran along the High Street (now pedestrianised) and continued west along the Wokingham Road (now B3408). Today the original London Road is dualled for a short section approaching the Met Office Roundabout. The dual carriageway then by-passes north of the pedestrianised town centre to the Giroscope Roundabout, where it crosses the former route, heading south west to the Twin Bridges roundabout and along the dual Berkshire Way to meet the old route at Amen Corner. Here the A329 continues into Wokingham on the original route, while the A329(M) by-passes to the north.|$|E
50|$|The first {{stretch of}} the A33 is a {{relatively}} new road, built as the A33 relief road, which starts on the Inner <b>Distribution</b> <b>Road</b> and bypasses most of suburban Reading, servicing the Kennet Island residential development, Madejski Stadium and Green Park Business Park, towards the M4, where it connects at junction 11. The first stretch of this road follows the route of the old Coley branch railway, including a passage under the railway era bridge carrying Berkeley Avenue. A two-year redevelopment scheme ran from early 2008 until late 2010, widening the northern section of the dual carriageway and significantly expanding and improving the motorway junction. The Mereoak Roundabout south of the motorway was replaced with two separate junctions with traffic lights.|$|E
40|$|Maintenance {{of habitat}} {{connectivity}} is recommended {{as a method}} of promoting biodiversity. A systematic manipulation of a simple theoretical landscape was used to assess how a landscape connectivity index responded to specific changes in habitat distribution. Quantifying the response of the index to changes in the spatial scale of dispersal is proposed {{as a method of}} objectively quantifying multiple aspects of landscape structure known to influence habitat connectivity. An ecosystem simulation model was used to assess if the index demonstrated the same patterns of response to changes in complex landscapes, and to quantify impact of logging <b>distribution,</b> <b>roads,</b> natural disturbances and habitat corridors. The high degree of sensitivity to the presence of roads, and the scale of response to different management scenarios highlight the value of the proposed index, and the sensitivity to the assumptions of habitat delineation used in index calculation. connectivitylandscape ecologyforestrybiodiversit...|$|R

50|$|The M4 {{motorway}} {{cuts through}} the town from southeast to northwest, crossing a central area on a concrete viaduct, junctions 38 to 41 serve Port Talbot, with junctions 40 and 41 being in the commercial heart of the town. This busy urban stretch of the M4, with tight bends, 2-lane carriageways, short narrow slip roads and concrete walls on both sides, was the first length of motorway in Wales when it opened to traffic in 1966. The road has a speed limit of 50 mi/h km/h enforced with a speed camera in the eastbound direction. The stretch through Port Talbot town centre is a particular traffic congestion blackspot {{and there have been}} calls to close the slip roads at junctions 40 and 41 to improve traffic flow. However some commuters oppose this plan since it would add more time to their journey. A new dual carriageway relief road, the Port Talbot Peripheral <b>Distribution</b> <b>Road</b> (PDR), was completed in 2013. It serves as a distributor road through Port Talbot to the southwest of the M4, beginning at M4 Junction 38 and ending near Junction 41.|$|E
50|$|Snow Hill {{station was}} the next major station to open in Birmingham, opening in 1852 as Livery Street station. It {{connected}} London (Paddington) to Wolverhampton Low Level. The station was rebuilt in 1871 to accommodate longer trains and again between 1906 and 1912. The latter scheme was undertaken so that the station could compete better with New Street. Other stations {{on the line in}} Birmingham were Soho and Winson Green and Hockley. To alleviate pressure on Snow Hill, Moor Street station was opened in 1909 as a terminus for the North Warwickshire lines. The two stations were linked by tunnel which closed in 1968, only to be reopened in 1987 under British Rail, when the new Moor Street station was completed. The 1960s Beeching Axe stated Snow Hill station as being unnecessary and the station closed in 1972 along with the line to Wolverhampton Low Level. The station was demolished by 1977, with only the original gates and booking hall sign surviving. However, in the 1980s, British Rail decided to re-open Snow Hill station as part of the cross-city transport plan for Birmingham. It reopened in 1987 as part of a completely redeveloped site with new office buildings replacing the original hotel, and multi-storey car parking over the station concourses. In 2011 a new station entrance was opened linking Snow Hill station to the Jewellery Quarter, {{on the other side of}} the A41 Queensway inner <b>distribution</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The courage {{needed to}} develop these schemes {{required}} {{a lot of political}} will, and this would sometimes falter.

For example, the extensive plans to develop a series of orbital and <b>distribution</b> <b>roads</b> into central London resulted {{in the construction of the}} A40(M) Westway, the M41 cross route and A102(M) Blackwall tunnel. However, the wide impact of these schemes raised such controversy during the 1970s that many associated road schemes soon ran into concerted opposition. After the 1973 oil crisis, those remaining schemes fell into limbo, casting a planning blight over the affected areas for a decade or more until they were finally laid to rest.
