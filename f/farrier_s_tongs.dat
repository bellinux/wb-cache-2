5000|$|In other cases, {{the tongs}} {{went to war}} {{with one another and}} brought their allies with them. Such {{was the case in the}} Bo Leong tong- Bo On tong war, with the Bo Leong’s {{supporters}} being the On Yick <b>tong</b> and Hop <b>Sing</b> <b>tong,</b> to do battle against the Bo On as well as their supporters, the Suey <b>Sing</b> <b>tong</b> and Hip <b>Sing</b> <b>tong.</b> Another example would be the Wah Ting San Fong tong and the Sen Suey Ying tong allying with the Hop Sings to fight the Suey <b>Sing</b> <b>tong.</b> The Chinese population of the San Francisco Chinatown and of the United States dropped dramatically during this turbulent era, from as many as 25,000 to only 14,000 by the beginning of 1900, with the Chinese U.S. population dropping by 16% during this time. [...] Some officials and scholars began to attempt to rank the tongs in terms of who was the bloodiest. One study came out with the Do On tong and the Suey <b>Sing</b> <b>tong</b> on top, while another stated by a Chinatown officer was that the top tongs were the Bing On and the Gee Sin Seer, led by Little Pete. But it should be said that never throughout the Tong Wars did a single tong gain supremacy over all others. As stated previously, there were cases of a war between two tongs widening due to the fact that any member could be a part of up to six tongs. An example was the Hip Sing tong- Hop <b>Sing</b> <b>tong</b> War, in which a Hop Sing killed a member of the Hip Sings, but he also turned out to be a prominent member of the Sen Suey Ying tong, so they then joined the fray. Later in that same war, a Sen Suey Ying member went to go curse a Hop Sing member, then was ambushed in a temple and mortally wounded, which then brought the Chee Kong tong into the mix as that man was a member of their tong as well. [...] While the tongs fiercely fought one another on the street for control of the criminal markets, a loose alliance of the community and of Mother Nature stemmed the tide of blood being washed over the streets of Chinatown by the hatchet men.|$|R

5000|$|The Tong Wars were fought {{not only}} on the streets and alleys of the Chinatown, but also on the rooftops in a deadly guerrilla warfare-like fashion. In a large number of cases, a tong war was started over the issue of a woman, whether it be the failure of one tong to fully pay for a slave-girl of another tong (As {{in the case of the}} Bing On tong - Wah Sin San Fan tong War) or just for the sheer fact of the limited amount of Chinese women in the area during the time (Hop <b>Sing</b> <b>tong</b> - Suey <b>Sing</b> <b>tong</b> War). Other tong wars started due to a variety of issues, from {{defamation}} of a rival tong’s “face” to attempting to take another tong's business. The Bing On tong - Wah Sin San Fan tong War was caused when Bing On sold the girl to a Wah Ting member but he did not pay the full amount specified, and the Bing Ons demanded that the bill be paid. The Wah Tings replied that the girl was not even worth $500 and if they wanted to do something about it they were welcome to try at their own risk. [...] The Hop <b>Sing</b> <b>tong</b> - Suey <b>Sing</b> <b>tong</b> War was particularly bloody, and by the time a truce was signed, four Hop sings lay dead with four more wounded compared to the Suey Sings’ two dead, one wounded. [...] This ongoing war was particularly bloody, as even though the truce was signed, they went back to war for a two more times, one time being of a three-month duration in 1900, which produced even deadlier results (seven dead in total, eight wounded and not a single murderer captured by police). [...] The other each killed one member of the other group, and the Hop Sings attempted to dynamite their rivals' headquarters.|$|R

5000|$|Only the Hip <b>Sing</b> <b>tong</b> {{is known}} to have {{established}} their tong on the East coast, making it the only known bi-coastal tong. A unique aspect of the Chee Kong tong was that their members used many euphemisms to direct their members, for example to order a kill on somebody was to “wash his body” (i.e. in his own blood), a rifle was called a “dog” and a pistol was suitably nicknamed a “puppy” while bullets and ammo were called “dog feed.” [...] When the leader wished for his men to fire, he shouted “let the dogs bark!” Usually, one tong specialized in a specific illegal activity, such as gambling, although some even had legitimate businesses, and some had both, such as the Bo Sin Seer tong, which ran many gambling dens but also had grocery stores under their ownership.The Wah Ting San Fong tong and the On Yick tong were said to specialize in the brothels, with the Kwong Duck tong and On Leung tong specializing in the trade of slave girls. Gambling dens was left to the Hip <b>Sing</b> <b>tong.</b> Most initiation ceremonies were not as elaborate as the first known tong organizations had, as the Chee Kong tong was quite traditional in this aspect, with accounts stating that the group still used many Triad symbols and signs. While uncertain {{as to whether or not}} other tongs adhered to this characteristic as well, but the Chee Kong tong headquarters would not observe any traditional Chinese holidays, and would only fly their flag full mast when it was a tong holiday, or when war was on the horizon.|$|R
