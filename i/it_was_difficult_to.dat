Although significant research was done, until 1978 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> determine the abundances of some iron-group elements (e.g. cobalt and manganese) via spectrography because of their hyperfine structures.|$|E
5|$|As a {{classical}} singer, Turunen sings with classical vocal technique. She explained {{that in the}} early days of Nightwish, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> combine classical technique with the metal sound in a way that gave her liberty of action without damaging her vocal cords. Classical techniques helped her to play with her voice, so she decided not to pursue extra training in rock/pop singing.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{mechanical}} experience {{gained from the}} Merchant Navy locomotives, Bulleid incorporated his chain-driven valve gear into what became the new design. This now-infamous component was unique in British locomotive design. It gained notoriety because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> access when things went wrong and, {{in tandem with the}} fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser, could cause irregular valve movements. The entire system was in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, that provided constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E

5|$|Bristol lies {{on one of}} the UK's lesser coalfields, {{and from}} the 17th century collieries opened in Bristol, and what is now North Somerset and South Gloucestershire.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, an unexplained {{decline in the}} alpine pika {{population}} occurred throughout the western Sayan Mountains. Although in 1977 Khlebnikov suggested {{it was due to}} an epidemic, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> ascertain if such a large territory had been affected all at once. By 1986 or 1987, a few localities that had high alpine pika population densities 16 to 17 years earlier became devoid of the species, due to its low reproductive rate and the insular nature of its habitat.|$|E
5|$|Incorrect {{unloading}} sequences and ballasting {{which resulted}} in the buoyancy of the hull becoming uneven and the hull therefore strained: Lack of crew training or knowing malpractice were possible explanations. Total was held largely to blame for this.

5|$|Judge Appleby {{eventually}} cut off {{funds for}} any further expert defense testimony. Shakur, in her autobiography, and Williams, in Inadmissible Evidence, both claim that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> find expert witnesses for the trial, {{because of the}} expense and because most forensic and ballistic specialists declined {{on the grounds of}} a conflict of interest when approached because they routinely performed such work for law enforcement officials.|$|E
5|$|Kakashi was {{originally}} created by Kishimoto to be a harsh teacher but the author decided to avoid that. Instead, he {{made him more}} generous to calm his students in difficult situations {{to the point of}} giving him feminine traits. Kakashi's design gave Kishimoto difficulties as a result of having most of his face covered and as a result <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> show his emotions. For the anime series, he is voiced by Kazuhiko Inoue in Japanese and Dave Wittenberg in the English dub.|$|E
5|$|One of Chamberlin's {{challenges}} {{was working}} with the Australians. Their decentralized mode of planning was entirely different from the top-down approach used by GHQ, and Chamberlin found this a source of frustration, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> extract information from them. Nonetheless, he established a good working relationship with the Australian Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Frank Berryman.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the airframe was fairly conventional, with a semi-monocoque frame and multi-spar wing. The aircraft used a measure of magnesium and titanium in the fuselage, the latter limited largely to {{the area around the}} engines and to fasteners. Titanium was still expensive and not widely used because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> machine.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Swinton O. Scott III. In the opening shot of the episode, the bus that the children travel in to the field trip had to vibrate up and down {{to give the impression}} that it did not have bumpers and that it was falling apart. Scott said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> animate the scene because of the vibrating and the backgrounds panning. Milhouse's tutor in the episode is based on the American actor Tony Randall.|$|E
5|$|The working {{title was}} 24: Exile. The {{concept of the}} film started since the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, which delayed the seventh season for a year thus leaving {{a gap in the}} series during 2008. Redemption was {{somewhat}} inspired by the Rwandan Genocide in 1994. The majority of Redemption was filmed on location outside Cape Town, South Africa since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> mimic an authentic African scenery in America.|$|E

5|$|While {{attempting}} {{to provide a}} high level of patient care for Jews, Christians, and Arabs, Shaare Zedek operated without electricity, indoor plumbing, central heating, or gas cooking stoves. Kerosene heaters were used to warm bathwater, and paraffin lamps were used in the operating room. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> retain staff due to the working conditions and to the exacting, temperamental nature of Dr. Wallach. Nevertheless, Schwester Selma worked 18-hour days, and expected her nurses and aides to display the same work ethic.|$|E
5|$|Whilst nearly {{fifteen of}} the tenders {{remained}} wedded {{to their original}} locomotives, others received new partners - the very first tender to be manufactured swapped partners seven times. After the Second World War, when the streamlined tenders were de-streamlined, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> spot any mismatches. The most readily visible mismatches were those of locomotives Nos. 6249–6252 where pre-produced Type 'A' streamlined tenders were married to unstreamlined locomotives.|$|E
5|$|A {{remake of}} Conker's Bad Fur Day, titled , was {{ultimately}} released for the Xbox in 2005 to generally favourable critical reception. Developers noted that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> port {{the game to}} the Xbox system because Bad Fur Days microcoded performance optimisations had been deeply customised for the Nintendo 64 hardware. Conker: Live & Reloaded features updated graphics and a multiplayer mode that supports the Xbox Live service. Additionally, some aspects in the single-player mode were adjusted: several minor obscenities within the voice dialogue that {{are present in the}} Nintendo 64 game were censored at Microsoft's request, the camera control was refined and improved with a zoom function, and an auto-targeting system was added to the game.|$|E

5|$|According to Kaga, upon release Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light {{received}} extensive {{criticism from}} Japanese publications, with many noting that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> understand and had fairly poor graphics, awarding it low scores. In contrast, popular opinion was more positive: {{in a poll}} taken by Family Computer Magazine, the game scored 23.48 points out of 30. Likewise, sales of the game were flat {{for the first two}} months of sales, but improved after word of mouth had spread. According to Kaga, a notable journalistic writer devoted a Famitsu column to the game, and this prompted sales to pick up around half a year after release. As of 2002, Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light had sold 329,087 units, being the third best-selling title in the series to that date.|$|E
5|$|After Van Leer's death, Paul Weber {{served as}} acting {{president}} from January 1956 to August 1957, while {{still holding the}} title of Dean of Faculties; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> find a permanent replacement due to discriminatory state laws and the looming issue of integration, along with a salary gap between Georgia Tech and comparable institutions. Weber's short tenure as acting president saw significantly increased enrollment standards, efforts by the Georgia Tech Foundation to increase faculty salaries, and further campus expansion including the Alexander Memorial Coliseum, which was completed and dedicated on October 27, 1956. Weber left larger organizational changes and integration for his eventual successor. After {{the selection of a}} replacement in the University of Toledo's Dean of Engineering, Edwin D. Harrison, Weber remained a Georgia Tech administrator and was named Vice President for Planning in 1966.|$|E
5|$|After leaving False Bay on 1 July, Bounty set {{out across}} the {{southern}} Indian Ocean on the long voyage to their next port of call, Adventure Bay in Tasmania. They passed the remote Île Saint-Paul, a small uninhabited island which Bligh knew from earlier navigators contained fresh water and a hot spring, {{but he did not}} attempt a landing. The weather was cold and wintry, conditions akin to the vicinity of Cape Horn, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> take navigational observations, but Bligh's skill was such that on 19 August he sighted Mewstone Rock, on the south-west corner of Tasmania and, two days later, made anchorage in Adventure Bay.|$|E
