[...] The report {{presents}} the theoretical calculations <b>of</b> <b>gust</b> alleviation factor made for rigid aircraft {{and with one}} degree of freedom only (i. e., vertical motion). It is shown that for average gust lengths and for orthodox (tailed) aircraft the influence of thesecond degree of freedom (i. e., pitching) on the value <b>of</b> the <b>gust</b> alleviation factor is negligibly small, providing the pitching moment of inertia and damping are not unduly small. The influence of aspect ratio, {{the importance of the}} mass parameter and the gust shape on the values <b>of</b> the <b>gust</b> alleviation factor are shown.

40|$|Analysis of {{spacecraft}} vehicle {{responses to}} atmospheric wind gusts during flight {{is important in}} the establishment of vehicle design structural requirements and operational capability. Typically, wind gust models can be either a spectral type determined by a random process having a wide range of wavelengths, or a discrete type having a single <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> predetermined magnitude and shape. Classical discrete models used by NASA during the Apollo and Space Shuttle Programs included a 9 m/sec quasi-square-wave gust with variable wavelength from 60 to 300 m. A later study derived discrete gust from a military specification (MIL-SPEC) document that used a " 1 -cosine" shape.

Results demonstrate significant additional energy present in the gusty wind resource at high temporal resolution. This energy is usually under-represented by the use of mean wind speeds in quantifying the power in the wind over longer averaging times. The results support the promise of capturing a portion of this extra energy through gust tracking solutions. The sensitivity of this “additional” wind energy to averaging time interval is also explored, providing useful information for the design <b>of</b> <b>gust</b> tracking or dynamic control algorithms for small-scale turbines. Relationships between turbulence intensity and excess energy available are drawn. Thus, an analytical model is proposed which may prove useful in predicting the excess energy available across wide areas from, for example, boundary layer turbulence models...|$|R

40|$|A new {{wind gust}} {{estimate}} method (denoted WGE method) is proposed. Contrary to most techniques used in operational weather forecasting, the determination <b>of</b> <b>gusts</b> {{in this approach}} is fully based on physical considerations. The main motivation for developing such an approach {{is to improve the}} knowledge of the physical processes that control the determination <b>of</b> <b>gusts.</b> The proposed approach assumes that surface gusts result from the deflection of air parcels flowing higher in the boundary layer, which are brought down by turbulent eddies. The WGE method takes into account the mean wind and the turbulent structure of the atmosphere. Moreover, this method includes the computation of a bounding interval around the gust estimate, which provides a range <b>of</b> likely <b>gust</b> magnitudes. The WGE method has been tested on two explosive cyclogenesis events that were satisfyingly simulated with the Modele Atmospherique Regional mesoscale model nested in the ECMWF analysis. Daily maximum gusts are predicted with good accuracy, while the hourly temporal evolution <b>of</b> estimated <b>gusts</b> depends strongly on the accuracy of the meteorological fields generated by the model. Typical error range for the gust estimates range is about 5 m s(- 1). The bounding interval is useful for determining the uncertainty around estimated <b>gusts.</b> Statistical evaluation <b>of</b> the WGE method shows that the main features of the climatology <b>of</b> <b>gusts</b> during the period from January to March 1990 are reproduced, even though estimated gusts have a negative bias (from 3 % to 10 %) compared to observations. An interesting aspect of the WGE method is the reliability of the bounding interval, with 73 % of the predicted daily gusts lying in this interval. Compared to other approaches, the WGE method is as good as other methods used in weather forecasting although extensive testing remains to be done...|$|R
