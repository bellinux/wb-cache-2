2500|$|LittleBigPlanet Sackboy's Prehistoric Moves is a LittleBigPlanet {{spin-off}} {{developed by}} Supermassive Games and SCE Worldwide Studios' XDev team, {{which can be}} played with two to five players and requires a PlayStation Move controller and a PlayStation <b>Eye</b> <b>Camera.</b> One player uses the PlayStation Move motion controller as a pointing device to manipulate the environment by triggering switches and moving platforms, while the others play using a gamepad to control Sackboy in the usual way. Although billed as a PlayStation Network game, Sackboy's Prehistoric Moves narrator introduces it as a [...] "demo". It features ten prehistoric-themed levels and was released on the PlayStation Store in North America on 7 December 2010, and in Europe on 8 December 2010 for PlayStation Plus subscribers. It was made available to other users in North America on 14 December 2010 and in Europe on 15 December 2010. The game was also bundled with LittleBigPlanet 2 when it was released in January 2011.|$|E

The image quality of compound <b>eye</b> <b>cameras</b> can be increased significantly by the use of refractive freeform arrays (RFFA) instead of conventional microlens arrays.

40|$|Miniaturized imaging systems {{combining}} an ultra-compact {{form factor}} {{in combination with}} the ability of refocusing and depth imaging have gained much interest in the field of mobile imaging. Therefore, artificial compound <b>eye</b> <b>cameras</b> are an extremely promising approach for the realization of compact monolithic camera modules on wafer level. Up to now, their imaging performance was limited to low resolution in the range of VGA format according to fabrication constrains given by the established microoptical fabrication methods, namely the reflow of photoresist. In order to overcome these classical limitations, the use of refractive freeform arrays (RFFA) instead of conventional microlens arrays is inevitable. To enable high volume and cost efficient mass production of artificial compound <b>eye</b> <b>cameras</b> for mass markets like the consumer electronics industry, their fabrication on wafer level is essential, but has not been published up to now. We present a wafer level based process chain enabling the fabrication of these elements for the first time...|$|R

40|$|Although the <b>camera</b> <b>eye</b> of the octopus is {{very similar}} to that of humans, phylogenetic and embryological {{analyses}} have suggested that their <b>camera</b> <b>eyes</b> have been acquired independently. It has been known as a typical example of convergent evolution. To study the molecular basis of convergent evolution of <b>camera</b> <b>eyes,</b> we conducted a comparative analysis of gene expression in octopus and human <b>camera</b> <b>eyes.</b> We sequenced 16, 432 ESTs of the octopus eye, leading to 1052 nonredundant genes that have matches in the protein database. Comparing these 1052 genes with 13, 303 already-known ESTs of the human eye, 729 (69. 3 %) genes were commonly expressed between the human and octopus eyes. On the contrary, when we compared octopus eye ESTs with human connective tissue ESTs, the expression similarity was quite low. To trace the evolutionary changes that are potentially responsible for <b>camera</b> <b>eye</b> formation, we also compared octopus-eye ESTs with the completed genome sequences of other organisms. We found that 1019 out of the 1052 genes had already existed at the common ancestor of bilateria, and 875 genes were conserved between humans and octopuses. It suggests that a larger number of conserved genes and their similar gene expression may be responsible for the convergent evolution of the <b>camera</b> <b>eye...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Coleoid {{cephalopods}} (squids and octopuses) {{have evolved}} a <b>camera</b> <b>eye,</b> {{the structure of}} which {{is very similar to}} that found in vertebrates and which is considered a classic example of convergent evolution. Other molluscs, however, possess mirror, pin-hole, or compound eyes, all of which differ from the <b>camera</b> <b>eye</b> in the degree of complexity of the eye structures and neurons participating in the visual circuit. Therefore, genes expressed in the cephalopod eye after divergence from the common molluscan ancestor could be involved in eye evolution through association with the acquisition of new structural components. To clarify the genetic mechanisms that contributed to the evolution of the cephalopod <b>camera</b> <b>eye,</b> we applied comprehensive transcriptomic analysis and conducted developmental validation of candidate genes involved in coleoid cephalopod eye evolution. Results We compared gene expression in the eyes of 6 molluscan (3 cephalopod and 3 non-cephalopod) species and selected 5, 707 genes as cephalopod camera eye-specific candidate genes on the basis of homology searches against 3 molluscan species without <b>camera</b> <b>eyes.</b> First, we confirmed the expression of these 5, 707 genes in the cephalopod <b>camera</b> <b>eye</b> formation processes by developmental array analysis. Second, using molecular evolutionary (dN/dS) analysis to detect positive selection in the cephalopod lineage, we identified 156 of these genes in which functions appeared to have changed after the divergence of cephalopods from the molluscan ancestor and which contributed to structural and functional diversification. Third, we selected 1, 571 genes, expressed in the <b>camera</b> <b>eyes</b> of both cephalopods and vertebrates, which could have independently acquired a function related to eye development at the expression level. Finally, as experimental validation, we identified three functionally novel cephalopod <b>camera</b> <b>eye</b> genes related to optic lobe formation in cephalopods by in situ hybridization analysis of embryonic pygmy squid. Conclusion We identified 156 genes positively selected in the cephalopod lineage and 1, 571 genes commonly found in the cephalopod and vertebrate <b>camera</b> <b>eyes</b> from the analysis of cephalopod <b>camera</b> <b>eye</b> specificity at the expression level. Experimental validation showed that the cephalopod camera eye-specific candidate genes include those expressed in the outer part of the optic lobes, which unique to coleoid cephalopods. The {{results of this study suggest}} that changes in gene expression and in the primary structure of proteins (through positive selection) from those in the common molluscan ancestor could have contributed, at least in part, to cephalopod <b>camera</b> <b>eye</b> acquisition. </p...|$|R
