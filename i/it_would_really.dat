Love previously had become known for his impressions of various Game of Thrones characters, uploading the video to YouTube, which ultimately resulted in his appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Following the appearance, Love stated that he had received an email from Benioff offering him a part in the show, saying [...] "I broached the subject by sending them an email back saying 'Listen I don't know what your plans are for me but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>really</b> mean a lot to me if I could have one of those trademark Game of Thrones gruesome death scenes, and they wrote back saying 'Actually Steve, that was exactly what we had in mind for you.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In Albrecht Altdorfer's The Battle of Alexander at Issus, one of {{the most}} famous {{paintings}} produced by the Danube School, a composition similar to Vädersolstavlan renders the battle scene in a detailed landscape under a sky crowded with celestial symbols and messages. Just as in Vädersolstavlan, the view is not depicted as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>really</b> appear, but is rather a composite of factual elements as known by the artist. In The Battle of Alexander at Issus the eastern Mediterranean Sea, Africa, and the Nile River are represented as known from contemporary maps, while the knights and soldiers are dressed in 16th century armours and the battle is depicted as retold in sources from Antiquity. [...] The frame suspended over the scene, a device which appears in many other German Renaissance battle scenes, is mirrored by the 17th century inscription in Vädersolstavlan. [...] In both paintings, Apocalyptic symbols in the sky are given a contemporary political significance. The realistically rendered sky, light, and clouds, in both paintings, are emblematic of the Danube School.|$|E
2500|$|Dimon {{commented on}} the Volcker Rule in January 2012, [...] "Part of the Volcker Rule I agreed with, which is no prop trading. But market making is an {{essential}} function. And the public should recognize {{that we have the}} widest, the deepest, the most transparent capital markets in the world. And part of that is because we have enormous market making. If the rules were written as they originally came out; I suspect they'll be changed, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>really</b> make it hard to be a market maker in the United States.” [...] He served as Chairman of the Executive Committee of The Business Council for 2011 and 2012.|$|E

Sweet as it is however, the Cosworth Vega is still way down the excitement ladder from what it would be with another 30 or 40 bhp. Then <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>really</b> be something." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1937, in {{tune with}} the National Christian Party regime, Cantacuzino had embraced eugenics, racism, and antisemitism. At a meeting in Cluj, she {{proposed}} the introduction of legislation banning all [...] "foreigners" [...] and minorities from marrying Romanian state employees, as well as 10-year reviews for all Romanian citizenship applications. Additionally, she and the GFR envisaged state bonuses for [...] "eugenic" [...] marriages between full-blooded Romanian youths. Meanwhile, her connections in the international feminist movement became alarmed by the growth of antisemitic violence. In a December 1933 letter to Cantacuzino, Cécile Brunschvicg inquired: [...] "there is talk of terrible antisemitic campaigns in Romania, and of the development of a Nazi spirit in your country. Is this true? [...] <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>really</b> be a deplorable if [...] spirit were to win over a Latin country that is so sane, and so very close to our hearts." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{rebellion}} in Ireland broke {{out at the}} end of May, with a friend in Ireland writing to Fitzwilliam that his Irish estate was [...] "the seat of war and {{rebellion in}} this part of the county". Fitzwilliam believed the origin of the rebellion was to be found in the spread of Jacobinism after his recall as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and that the solution was [...] "a fundamental change of system" [...] there. Fitzwilliam voted with the Foxites in the debates on the issue and completed his progress back to joining them. The next year he also opposed the Union between Britain and Ireland and that [...] "the measure cannot be carried but by the length of the sword. It cannot be an Union of consent on the part of Ireland. On 19 March 1799 he led the opposition in the Lords and said Emancipation should be enacted without Union because: [...] "Did anyone at this time of day believe that the family of the Stuarts would be supported by the Catholics?" [...] In 1800 he spoke again, declaring that he would support a Union but only if <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>really</b> unite the two kingdoms together, and that the penal laws were [...] "framed against a particular description of persons which now ceased to exist: they were directed against superstition, bigotry and disloyalty; and therefore should not affect the liberal, the well-meaning, and the loyal Catholics of the present day". Fox wrote to a friend on 6 December 1799 that Fitzwilliam and Lord Holland were the only [...] "two who have from me every degree of good will and affection". However, in February 1800 Fitzwilliam openly disagreed with Fox's desire for peace with France because the national interest called for a prosecution of the war at least until the enemy accepted the status quo ante bellum, although he criticised the government for conduct of it. Writing to Laurence on 2 August and 26 October Fitzwilliam changed his position on the war in the light of Austria (Britain's remaining ally) making peace with France: [...] "I am ready to confess that I do not see how war without Continental alliances can tend to produce a counter-revolutionary system in France". France under the rule of Napoleon was in Fitzwilliam's view was less revolutionary: [...] "He may continue the use of revolutionary jargon, but he will check all revolutionary practices. He may gratify his lust of glory by subjugating kingdoms and nations, but he will subvert the roders of things in them no more than is necessary for his first purpose. ... people have seen that, after all, revolutions are but a lottery for power, the people...are left worse than they were found, having been fleeced of everything valuable. From the result of the consideration, then, I am inclined to think peace desirable".|$|E
