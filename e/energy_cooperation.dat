The logistic model, which is often used to describe the law of population growth in biology, could analysis the stability of regional <b>energy</b> security <b>cooperation.</b> According to which the hierarchy of needs and resource dependencies among the Northeast Asian countries, there are three models of cooperation, which are Equality and mutual benefit model, attachment symbiotic model and resource dependence model. Each model is analyzed, and then some suggestions are given...|$|R

Another consequence of this is that much of their programme has been domestically developed, much like their nuclear weapons programme.

2500|$|The United States was {{concerned}} {{with the prospect of}} a nuclear Sweden, which jeopardized the world with further nuclear proliferation. In 1956, the United States and Sweden signed an agreement on civilian nuclear <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation.</b> The two parties agreed to exchange information regarding the construction, operation and development of research reactors. The Swedish government committed itself to providing the AEC with information regarding nuclear energy developments in Sweden. The deal also implied that the US nuclear umbrella would protect Sweden, and so {{there was no need for}} any nuclear arms. In May 1956, the National Federation of Social Democratic Women in Sweden took a stand against nuclear weapons, which heretofore had not been a major public issue in Sweden. Swedlund's position became the focal point for an intense debate in the media during 1957. The FOA's chief director, Hugo Larsson, also helped to energize the debate with an interview in Dagens Eko in 1957, in which he said that Sweden had the resources to build nuclear weapons, which could be completed in 1963-1964. [...] Among the proponents of Swedish nuclear weapons program was Dagens Nyheters chief editor, Herbert Tingsten, and former Social Democratic Defense Minister Per Edvin Sköld. Even the prospective leader of the Liberal People's Party, Per Ahlmark, was an advocate of Swedish nuclear weapons. Many of opponents of Swedish nuclear weapons development were found on the cultural left. The nuclear weapons issue would appear frequently in the press cultural pages. Meanwhile, among the opponents were Inga Thorsson, Ernst Wigforss, and Östen Unden. The editor of Folket i Bild, Per Anders Fogelström, advocated against Swedish nuclear weapons in the magazine, and published a book “Instead of the Atomic Bomb” together with Social Democratic student politician, Roland Morell. In 1957, they launched a petition against Swedish nuclear weapons, that was signed by 95,000 people and was handed over to Tage Erlander in February 1958.|$|E
