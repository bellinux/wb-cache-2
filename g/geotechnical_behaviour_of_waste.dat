40|$|In Australia, a {{large amount}} of {{industrial}} byproducts are produced annually, mainly coal wash (CW) and steel furnace slag (SFS) from coal mining and steel making, respectively. The effective reuse and recycling of these materials rather than their disposal are the preferred and sustainable methods from the waste management perspective and these are economically beneficial. In recent years, the need for more land to accommodate new infrastructures such as expansion of existing ports has been increased significantly. The use of industrial waste as structural fill material is considered relevant for these types of projects. However, {{due to the lack of}} information on the <b>geotechnical</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> materials, specifically mixtures of coal wash and steel furnace slag, they have been used in limited quantities. Individual CW and SFS can pose serious problems due to the swelling potential in SFS and particle degradation in CW that can cause differential settlements. However, the adverse effect of individual materials might be minimised by blending them together. Therefore, an in-depth study on the geotechnical behaviour of CW-SFS mixtures is essential. This doctoral thesis is part of an industrial project for the expansion of Port Kembla Outer Harbour near Wollongong, Australia. For this project, mixtures of CW-SFS (five mixtures in total) were considered for the fill material. The suitability of different CW-SFS mixtures in terms of geotechnical characteristics to be used as structural fill is investigated through extensive laboratory tests. A comprehensive range of geotechnical parameters of CW-SFS blends was determined in order to establish the relationship between them and the CW percentage. These parameters include specific gravity, compaction characteristics and degradation due to the compaction energy, permeability of the mixtures compacted to the maximum dry density, California Bearing Ratio (CBR) both for as compacted and soaked condition, the Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS), the swelling (free swelling and swelling pressure) characteristics and in-depth study on the stress-strain behaviour under monotonic triaxial conditions. In order to investigate the effect of CW (or SFS) content in the mechanical behaviour of CW-SFS blends, series of drained triaxial tests on 100 mm diameter and 200 mm height specimens were carried out. Confining pressure was varied between 30 kPa to 220 kPa to mimic port loading conditions. Based on these tests, an empirical equation was proposed to predict the peak deviatoric stress for different CW-SFS blends and confining pressure. Furthermore, the ultimate adoption of CW-SFS mixtures as structural fill was supported by establishing a mathematical model for the stressstrain behaviour based on generalised plasticity and critical state concept. It was shown that within a unique framework, the model was capable of capturing the mechanical behaviour of different CW-SFS mixtures. Based on the laboratory results, an optimisation method for the CW-SFS mixtures was suggested. Following this method, the most suitable blends can be identified by considering the required properties for site condition. The performance of the CWSFS mixtures on a large scale was assessed through field investigation, with the results confirming the suitability of the optimum mixture as structural fill. The constitutive model proposed for the CW-SFS blends was implemented into the finite element software (ABAQUS) by developing the user-defined program (known as the UMAT subroutine). The numerical model was initially calibrated using the drained triaxial results from the laboratory and then verified and assessed by comparing them to the field trial investigation. The numerical model is capable of being used under different loading conditions for a range of CW-SFS mixtures, enabling practicing engineers and designers to evaluate the performance of a given blend for site conditions...|$|E

The energy and <b>geotechnical</b> <b>behaviours</b> <b>of</b> such foundations, which are governed by their response to thermo-mechanical loads, is currently not fully understood, especially considering the different design solutions for ground-coupled heat exchangers. This paper summarises the results of numerical sensitivity analyses that were performed to investigate the thermo-mechanical response of a full-scale energy pile for different (i) pipe configurations, (ii) foundation aspect ratios, (iii) mass flow rates of the fluid circulating in the pipes and (iv) fluid mixture compositions.

40|$|Abstract — Change in <b>geotechnical</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> {{fine grained}} soils under the {{influence}} of inorganic salts depends on the chemistry of the soil constituents and the pore fluid. The modification <b>of</b> soil <b>behaviour</b> largely depends upon the clay particles which belongs to size 0. 002 mm and less and it is unique in nature. The different nature of clay is due to net electrical charge on them. In general, clay particles surface are negatively charged and its edges are positively charged. To preserve electrical neutrality the negative charge of the clay particle is balanced by the attraction of cations which are held between the layers, and {{on the surface of the}} particles. The charged clay surface together with the counter–ions in the pore water form diffuse double layer. Furthermore, the double layer is influenced by the valency of the counter–ions and the temperature. Use of salt solution as pore fluid generally causes decrease in liquid limits.

Fine sand having high permeability and low shear strength is also not suitable for earthen dam construction. For the same reasons, fine sand is not suitable for constructing landfill liners and covers. The disposal of pond ash from power plants has been a major environmental concern over a period of last few decades. In presence of moisture, pond ash reacts with lime and forms cementitious compounds which can be used to increase the strength of weak soil.

40|$|In {{spite of}} recent {{advances}} in track geotechnology, {{the understanding of the}} mechanisms of ballast degradation is vital for improved design to withstand high speed cyclic loading. The research conducted at Centre for Geomechanics and Railway Engineering (CGRE) at University of Wollongong (UOW) has shown that ballast degradation is influenced by various factors including the amplitude, frequency, number of load cycles, particle size distribution, confining pressure, angularity and fracture strength of individual grains. A series of cyclic drained triaxial tests were conducted using a largescale cylindrical apparatus designed and built at UOW for frequencies ranging from 10 - 40 Hz. A low range of confining pressures to resemble 2 ̆ 7 in-situ 2 ̆ 7 track conditions was applied. The results showed that permanent deformation and degradation of ballast increased with the frequency.

40|$|Abstract: All the hilltops of {{the city}} of Athens are {{occupied}} by the formation of "Tourkovounia " Limestones. Some of the most important monuments in the city and also many residential areas are founded on these formations. The world renowned monument of Acropolis, the ancient Supreme Court (Arios Pagos), and the Pnika are prime examples of monuments founded on these limestones. A detailed knowledge of the geotectonic data and geotechnical characteristics regarding these formations are clearly important for construction work in these areas. From the evaluation of engineering-geological maps and tectonic data, from both recent and older studies, it can be determined that these formations are intersected by faults, mainly normal, which in some locations have been subject to intensive karstic weathering. This weathering turns those faults into wide karstic fissures. The karstic voids formed by this mechanism are often 0. 5 to 2 m wide and can be infilled or partially infilled with clay or stalagmitic materials. When the karstic fissures intersect the voids can get extremely wide and in some places the voids were up to 15 m across.

Results indicated that the shale samples have Atterberg limits that might be considered moderate to high; while Liquid Limit (LL) ranged from 49 – 54, the Plasticity Index (PI) ranged from 34 – 38. These relatively high LL and PI suggested presence of expansive clays, some swelling of the shale on moisture influx and high compressibility. Natural moisture content (with mean value of 20 %) was also significantly high. Hydrochemical analyses, on the other hand, revealed that the water samples had comparatively high content of ions and dissolved particles; Ca 2 + ranged from 8. 0 – 134. 0 mg/l, Mg 2 + ranged from 0. 2 – 3. 3 mg/l, HCO- 3 ranged from 21. 8 – 1176. 1 mg/l and total dissolved solids ranged 56. 9 – 1415. 0 mg/l.

On this basis, a joint study has been initiated by the Safe Mountain Foundation (Fondazione Montagna Sicura, Cormayeur, Italy) and some Universities to investigate variations in the <b>geotechnical</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> Alpine permafrost caused by changes in temperature. Permafrost is found in Alpine regions at elevations higher than about 2500 m above sea level, depending on the location and exposure of the slope. Its mechanical features are determined by the coupled contribution of the soil particles and of the ice. The water content can have an important influence on the resistance of the frozen soil: if the water content is low, the ice {{will not be able to}} include the soil particles, however, if it is too high the resistance will be determined above all by the ice itself (Andresland, 1987). Temperature is another driving factor that can influence the mechanical <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> ice (Fish, 1997). On this basis this work has been dedicated to analysing the <b>geotechnical</b> and geophysical <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> the widespread morainic deposits found in Alpine areas, subjected to different climatic conditions when the temperature increases. The work is dedicated, in particular, to the geotechnical and geophysical characterization of two different glacial deposits present in the Aosta Valley region: the first one generated by Tsanteleina glacier (Rhêmes Valley, 2690 m a. s. l.) and the second one surrounding the Blu lake (Ayas Valley, 2214 m a. s. l.). The characterization has been carried out at different scales: at a laboratory scale, on the thinner components of the granular material and at an in situ scale, through geotechnical measurement and geophysical testing. The geotechnical measurement were performed through photographical dimension analysis of the deposit and geophysical measurement by means of seismic and electrical surveys.

40|$|Considerable {{savings in}} the cost and time {{expended}} in design and construction work will result from more realistic appraisal of material transitional between engineering soil and engineering rock. Research was therefore directed to seeking means of maximising the return of relevant information from routine site investigation work. Definitions of 'transitional material' are proposed, based on geological, contractual and technical criteria. Related definitions are proposed for 'engineering soil' and 'engineering rock'. Flow charts {{have been developed to}} assist in the categorisation of geotechnical material into the types proposed by a Working Party of the Geological Society (1977) and BS 5930 : 1081. Simple laboratory and fieldwork index testing was found to provide an adequate basis for the realistic assessment of the potential engineering <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> a range of geotechnical materials. Some modification to routine procedures is proposed for work with transitional material. Pressuremeter testing was generally found to give reproduceable results in fresh oolitic limestone (Beerstone) and in highly weathered Shale, Keuper Marl and Granite. The results of high pressure triaxial and pressuremeter testing of Beerstone are compared and assessed. Further comparison is drawn between the results of pressuremeter testing of Keuper Marl and those obtained during a commercial site investigation from (i) plate bearing tests, and (ii) laboratory testing, of material from the same site. The means of obtaining and communicating geotechnical information are critically appraised.

40|$|Many {{industrial}} processes {{result in the}} production <b>of</b> silt sized <b>waste</b> materials which may be disposed of by being pumped as a slurry to settling lagoons where the solids settle to form fills which often have a high voids ratio. These are described as hydraulic fills. These processes are commonly found in the coal based power generation and mining and mineral processing industries, amongst others. The <b>geotechnical</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> such deposits is of interest {{with respect to the}} integrity and safety of the impoundment systems and possible future use and redevelopment of the sites. Such deposits are very difficult to sample and in many cases {{it is almost impossible to}} obtain notionally undisturbed samples, and so it is necessary to prepare samples in the laboratory using techniques which simulate field conditions. The paper describes the results of a series of one dimensional compression tests, up to very high stress levels, on pulverised fuel ash (PFA) and fluorspar mine tailings. Sample preparation methods attempting to recreate the in-situ structure and density are described. The results presented consider the initial 1 -dimensional loading of the initially loose specimens, their unloading response and their creep behaviour. An attempt is made to define the normal consolidation line for these materials and the importance of the initial voids ratio is discussed. A general conceptual model of one dimensional compression behaviour is presented. The secondary compression, or creep, response is discussed, and creep behaviour may be important in considering their behaviour. The creep behaviour displays a linear relation in e-log(t) space. Contours of equal time of creep (isotaches) are suggested which are parallel to the normal consolidation line...|$|R
40|$|Solid Waste Management {{is one of}} the {{essential}} services provided by local bodies to keep the urban areas clean. Often it is poorly rendered as it is unscientific, out-dated and inefficient. With the rapid increase in population, livening standards, the generation rates <b>of</b> solid <b>waste</b> are increasing drastically. The landfill waste includes both organic and inorganic wastes as it is not often effectively segregated before disposal. The problem is acute in developing countries such as India. Bangalore city, with a population of about 10. 18 million and more than 2000 industries, generates about 4, 500 TPD <b>of</b> municipal solid <b>waste.</b> <b>Of</b> this Presently, various municipal solid waste processing units in Bangalore can handle only about 2100 TPD <b>of</b> <b>waste.</b> Mavallipura landfill developed and operated by M/s. Ramky Environmental Engineers, located 40 km away from Bangalore, is being used for disposing of about 1000 TPD, the installed capacity being only 600 TPD <b>of</b> <b>waste.</b> There are also a few dumps in around Bangalore due to historical reasons and insufficient capacity of various designated landfills. To reclaim the old dump sites/closed landfill sites for infrastructural development, it is necessary to know their geotechnical characteristics. Within the Landfill, the characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>waste</b> may change with depth due to degraded wastes as it has been dumped over a period of time. The physical parameters, chemical properties as well as the <b>geotechnical</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> the <b>waste</b> change with depth. MSW is known to be a heterogeneous material of varying constituent types and dimensions, containing elements that degrade with time. To consider MSW as a geo-material to support the foundation of structures such as buildings and pavement, an analysis of the bearing capacity of the foundation and further long-term settlement of MSW is essential. The MSW samples are retrieved from a Mavallipura landfill site, Bangalore and analysed for important geotechnical properties such as compaction characteristics, shear strength, permeability, compressibility behaviour and dynamic properties of MSW using ultrasonic and cyclic triaxial tests. This research thus aims to provide valuable information about landfill sites for reclamation, closure and infrastructural development after the closure of landfills. Scanty data are available on the geotechnical properties <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> from landfill sites with varying degrees of degradation. This landfill site is selected as there is a huge environmental concern regarding the soil and groundwater contamination in the area and also can represent a typical landfill scenario in tropical regions. Quantification, quality assessment, consequent treatment and management of leachate have become a monstrous problem world over. In this context, the present study envisages to study the physicochemical and biological characterization of representative urban municipal landfill leachate and nearby water bodies and attempts to figure out relationships between the various parameters together with understanding the various processes for chemical transformations. The analysis shows intermediate leachate age (5 - 10 years) with higher nutrient levels i. e. 10, 000 - 12, 000 mg/l and ~ 2, 000 - 3, 000 mg/l of carbon (COD) and nitrogen (TKN) respectively. Elemental analysis and underlying mechanisms reveal chemical precipitation and co-precipitation as the vital processes in leachate pond systems resulting in accumulation of trace metals in these systems. The microbial analysis also correlated with specific factors relevant to redox environments that show a gradient in nature and the abundance of biotic diversity with a change in leachate environment. Finally, the quality and the contamination potential of the sampled leachate were performed with the help of potential leachate index (LPI) analysis and water quality index (WQI) analysis for surrounding water bodies (namely surface pond and open well) of Mavallipura landfill site. A geotechnical testing program has been drawn to evaluate the engineering properties <b>of</b> municipal solid <b>waste</b> samples retrieved from a landfill at Mavallipura at various depths through augur within the landfill dumped area. Laboratory studies included are composition, moisture content, particle size analysis, compaction, permeability, direct shear test, consolidation, triaxial compression test. For the laboratory tests, we had considered maximum particle sizes of less than 4. 75 mm only. Standard Proctor Compaction tests yielded a maximum dry density of 7. 0 kN/m 3 at 50 % optimum moisture content. The permeability of MSW results shows in the range of 4 x 10 - 4 cm/sec. Compression index of MSW is 0. 46980 and recompression index of MSW is 0. 09454. Results obtained from the rectangular hyperbola method are compared with Casagrande and Taylor methods to prove that this method is reliable equally, and results are reasonably accurate. Based on direct shear tests, the MSW sample exhibited continuous strength gain with an increase in shear strain (16 %) to define strength. The cohesion of MSW was 10 kPa and friction angle is 34 °. Based on the elastic constants results obtained from the direct shear test found to be very soft material. In the triaxial test, the MSW sample exhibited continuous strength gain with an increase in axial strain. The frictional component is increased due to sliding and rolling of fibrous particles over one another resulting in the development of apparent cohesion due to antiparticle bonds within the MSW material. Landfills are an integral part <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> management, and disastrous consequences can happen if seismic vulnerability of these landfills is not considered. Dynamic properties of MSW are required to perform seismic response analysis of MSW landfills, but there is no good understanding of the dynamic shear strength of MSW in literature. A comprehensive laboratory cyclic triaxial testing program has been taken up to determine the properties at different densities, confining pressures and shear strains. MSW degrades with time, and its shear modulus and damping are expected to vary with time and degradation. For the density of 6 kN/m 3 the dynamic shear modulus values for MSW varied from 0. 68 MPa to 5. 38 MPa and damping ratio varied from 20 % to 40 % for MSW. For the density of 7 kN/m 3 the dynamic shear modulus values for MSW varied from 1. 8 MPa to 7. 5 MPa and Damping ratio varied from 23 % to 40 % for MSW. For the density of 8 kN/m 3 dynamic shear modulus values for MSW varied from 2. 46 MPa to 8. 00 MPa and damping ratio varied from 16 % to 33 % for MSW. Also, the ultrasonic testing method was used for determining the dynamic properties at low strains. The Ultrasonic test results indicated that with an increase in density of the sample and with decreased void ratio, the pulse propagation velocity (Vp) increases. With an increase in the density, the shear wave velocity and elastic constants (elastic modulus and shear modulus) increase. The elastic constant values obtained from the ultrasonic test are higher compared to values obtained from unconsolidated-undrained triaxial tests. Also, the carbon stored in the buried organic matter in Mavallipura landfill is estimated. Total organic carbon increases steeply with an increase in depth and is significantly high at a depth of 6 m. Subsurface properties cannot be specified but must be analysed through in-situ tests. The in-situ testing that are carried out in a landfill are boring, sampling, standard penetration test (SPT), dynamic cone penetration test (DCPT) and plate load tests (under static and cyclic condition). A correlation between corrected SPT ‘N’ values and measured using shear wave velocities has been developed for Mavallipura landfill site. Results show that the corrected SPT- N values increase with depth. Corrected N-values are used in the landfill design, so they are consistent with the design method, and correlations are useful. The results obtained from the dynamic cone penetration tests shows lower value when to compare with standard penetration test. The unit weight profile with depth ranged from a low unit weight of 2. 48 kN/m 3 near the surface to a highest value of approximately 9. 02 kN/m 3 at a depth of 6 m. The highest temperatures for landfills were reported at mid-waste elevations with temperatures decreasing near the top. The bearing pressure-settlement curves for plate size 75 cm and 60 cm presented similar behaviour while the plate size of 60 cm curve presents a lesser settlement of 70 mm, compared to with plate size of the 75 cm curve with the settlement of 80 mm and failure mode could be classified as punching shear. The cyclic plate load test with plate size of 60 cm and 75 cm were carried out on the soil cover. The elastic constants were found to be 73. 87 and 96. 84 kPa/mm and for 60 and 75 cm plates respectively. Geophysical testing may not be as precise but has the benefit of covering large areas at small costs and sometimes can locate features that might be missing by conventional borings. Multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) is an indirect geophysical method used in the landfill for the characterization of the municipal solid waste site. The Mavallipura landfill was surveyed up to the length of about 35 m at the top level. A series of one-dimensional and two-dimensional MASW surveys used active seismic sources such as sledgehammer (5 kg) and propelled energy generator (PEG- 40) was used. This hammer was instrumented with geophones to trigger record time. All the testing has been carried out with geophone spacing of 1 m and recorded surface wave arrivals using the source to first receiver distance as 5 m with recording length of 1000 millisecond and the recording sampling interval of 0. 5 milliseconds (ms) were applied. Results shows that the PEG- 40 hammer can generate the longest wavelength with a maximum depth of penetration. The shear wave velocity varies from 75 to 155 m/s with an increase in depth of about 27. 5 m. Based on the site characterization at the landfill site, {{it was found that the}} Mavallipura landfill site can be categorized as very loose, and it is still in a continued stage of degradation. Shear wave and P-wave velocity profile for eight major locations in the study area were determined and variation <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> material stiffness corresponding to the in-situ state with depth, was also evaluated. Also, MASW survey has been carried out to develop dispersion curve on another landfill site at Bhandewadi, Nagpur. MASW system consisting of 24 channels geode seismograph with 24 geophones of 4. 5 Hz capacity is used in this investigation. The seismic waves were created by sledgehammer with 30 cmx 30 cmx 2 cm size hammer plate with ten shots. These waves were captured by the geophones/receivers and further analyzed by inversion. The results indicated that near surface soils(less than 3 m depth) approximately the to 5 mm, and with 85 % of dry weight basis <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> particles with sizes less than 10 mm, the shear wave velocity varies from 75 to 140 m/s (frequency ranges from 30 to 23 Hz). With the increase in 6. 5 m depth, the shear wave velocity ranged from 140 to 225 m/s (frequency ranges 23 to 13 Hz). Overall, the results of the study showed that seismic surveys have the potential to capture the changes in dynamic properties like shear wave velocity and Poisson’s ratio of the depth of MSW landfill to infer the extent of degradation and provide dynamic properties needed for seismic stability evaluations. Based on the in situ and laboratory results of this study and a review of the literature, the unit weight, shear wave velocity, strain-dependent normalized shear modulus reduction and material damping ratio relationships for Mavallipura landfill are developed and also validated using semi-empirical methods. Finally, seismic response analysis of Mavallipura landfill has been carried out using the computer programs like SHAKE 2000 and DEEPSOIL. Results show that the unit weight is increased with depth in response to the increase in overburden stress. The proposed material damping ratio and normalized shear modulus reduction curve lie close to the profile given in the literature for landfills composed <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> materials with 100 % particles sized less than 20 mm. Peak spectral acceleration at 5 % damping value is 0. 7 g for 0. 07 sec in SHAKE 2000 and peak spectral acceleration at 5 % damping value is 0. 63 g for 0. 04 sec in DEEPSOIL. Amplification ratio is 6. 11 at 1. 1 l Hz in SHAKE 2000 and 4. 65 at 2. 67 Hz in DEEPSOIL. Peak ground acceleration (PGA) for the landfill site, it is observed PGA has decreased from 0. 3 g to 0. 15 g in DEEPSOIL and PGA has decreased from 0. 33 g to 0. 15 g in SHAKE 2000. The studies presented in the thesis brought out the importance of characterization <b>of</b> municipal solid <b>waste</b> leachate regarding metabolism and treatment/degradation of Mavallipura landfill leachate. For municipal solid <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> with sizes ranging from 0. 08 coefficient of permeability being about 10 - 4 cm/sec, the compression index was about 0. 47. A more reliable method of calculating the coefficient of consolidation has been recommended. Correlations between shear wave velocity and SPT-N values has been developed for the Mavallipura landfill site. The results showed that the dynamic cone penetration tests values are lower than indicated by standard penetration tests. The cyclic plate load tests carried out with plate sizes of 75 cm and 60 cm showed that elastic constants of 96. 84 kPa/mm and 73. 87 kPa/mm respectively. MSW properties evaluated in this thesis are compared with those of soft clays. The MSW properties showed higher values (strength and SBC) and lower values of compressibility, compared with those of soft clays. Thus foundation improvement on MSW is less challenging than foundations on soft soils. Also stabilization of MSW with other solid wastes such as fly ash can be considered as an economical option. Based on detailed studies the importance of unit weight, shear wave velocity, strain-dependent normalized shear modulus reduction and material damping ratio relationships for landfill waste have been developed. Based on the site characterization, the waste landfill has been categorized as very loose material, which is still in a degradation process.

40|$|Abstract: The {{clay and}} non-clay {{minerals}} {{have been identified}} by XRD analysis. The non-clay minerals include quartz, crystobalite, orthoclase, microcline, plagioclase, calcite, siderite and dolomite, and the clay minerals include kaolinite (52. 39 %), illite (36. 39 %) and illite-smectite mixed layer minerals (11. 21 %). Kaolinite is the most dominant component in the clay mineral assemblages. The clay minerals e. g. kaolinite, illite and illite-smectite have influences on the liquid limit, plastic limit and plasticity index. The higher amount of illite and illite-smectite will increase the liquid limit, plastic limit and plasticity index in the soil whereas higher amount of kaolinite would decrease the liquid limit, plastic limit and plasticity index. The higher the amount of illite and illite-smectite in the soil, the higher the activity in that soil. The clay minerals like kaolinite, illite and illite-smectite have marked influences on the shrinkage limit of the soil. The higher the illite-smectite in the soil, the higher the co-efficient of volume change (mV), compression index (CC), and preconsolidation pressure in the soils. The higher amount of kaolinite and illite decrease the co-efficient of volume change (mV), compression index (CC) and preconsolidation pressure. The increase of kaolinite and illite-smectite in the soil decreases coefficient of consolidation. But the increase of illite slightly increases the coefficient of consolidation. Illite influences the coefficient of permeability value less than illite-smectite, but more than kaolinite. Therefore, the clay minerals have significant influences on the <b>geotechnical</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> the Madhupur Clay soil of Dhaka and Savar...|$|R
