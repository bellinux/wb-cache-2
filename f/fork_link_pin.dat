50|$|The Colt {{performed}} well enough {{during the first}} round of testing that the board subjected it to additional endurance testing. A 900 round trial resulted in only two failures, both misfires due to defective primers. Additional ammunition was procured, and testing continued. During this testing, a number of <b>link</b> <b>pins</b> were also broken, and in one case continued firing with a broken rear link caused the barrel to separate just behind the front <b>link</b> <b>pin.</b> After firing a total of 5,800 rounds through the pistol, the only significant problem found was the weakness of the <b>link</b> <b>pins,</b> which was considered readily fixed by the ordnance board. The board recommended purchasing a number of the Model 1900 Colt pistols for use in field trials.|$|R
50|$|The <b>linking</b> <b>pin</b> {{model is}} an idea {{developed}} by Rensis Likert. It presents an organisation {{as a number of}} overlapping work units in which a member of a unit is the leader of another unit. In this scheme, the supervisor/manager has the dual task of maintaining unity and creating a sense of belonging within the group he or she supervises and of representing that group in meetings with superior and parallel management staff. These individuals are the <b>linking</b> <b>pins</b> within the organisation and so they become the focus of leadership development activities.|$|R
5000|$|At the 1939 Ulster GP, {{the last}} GP before the War, the two bikes {{led from the}} start against Nortons and a {{supercharged}} four-cylinder Gilera, but halfway round {{the first of the}} 14 mi laps, already timed at 135 mi/h km/h on one section, A R (Bob) Foster retired with plug trouble. Rusk completed the first lap at a record breaking average of 100.03 mi/h km/h and a lead of 34 seconds. On the third lap a <b>fork</b> <b>link</b> broke forcing retirement. [...] It is believed that this was caused by mistaken fitment of a 7R <b>fork</b> <b>link</b> instead of the stronger V4 part during servicing.|$|R

50|$|A leading <b>link</b> <b>fork</b> suspends {{the wheel}} on a link (or links) with a pivot point aft {{of the wheel}} axle. Russian Ural {{motorcycles}} still use leading <b>link</b> <b>forks</b> on sidecar equipped motorcycles, and aftermarket leading <b>link</b> <b>forks</b> are often installed today on motorcycles when they are outfitted with sidecars. They are also very popular with trikes, improving the handling while steering or braking. The most common example of a leading <b>link</b> <b>fork</b> is that found on the Honda Super Cub.|$|R
50|$|The Deployant Clasp with a Push Button (DCP) is a clasp {{available}} for many Citizen watch bracelet bands. The clasp, {{as with the}} Calibre 8700, is also used with leather bands {{as if they were}} metal bracelet-style watchbands; however, when the clasp is fastened, the band appears to be a normal eye-hole and <b>link</b> <b>pin</b> leather watchband.|$|R
50|$|In railway {{passenger}} cars fitted with flexicoil suspension, the springs {{are the only}} mechanical connection between the bogie and the car body. In heavier types of flexicoil suspension rolling stock, a bogie pivot fitted with rubber-metal bearings is used to hold a cross anchor yoke, which transfers the forces to the bogie frame via two cross anchor <b>link</b> <b>pins.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Front {{suspension}} {{is based}} on Volkswagen type 1 <b>link</b> <b>pin</b> style. [...] Rear suspension {{is based on}} VW Type 1 independent rear suspension, rear suspension arms may be lengthened up to 1 inch. Stock track width as measured, wheel mating surface to wheel mating surface must be maintained. No secondary suspension is allowed. Additional modifications are allowed with limitations. No air or coiler shocks allowed.|$|R
50|$|If the pinout of the 4307A is {{compared}} to that of the 807 the similarity is striking. All pins are assigned equivalent electrodes with the exception of pin 4, which is the suppressor grid, g3, in this type but in the 807 pin 4 is connected to the equivalent of a suppressor grid, the 'beam plates' and also the separate indirectly heated cathode.It is possible to interchange the two with the relatively minor alteration involving the <b>linking</b> of <b>pins</b> 4 and 5 and ensuring the heater supply is floating (not connected to other heaters). If the heater is supplied from an A.C. source, <b>linking</b> <b>pin</b> 4 to the centre of that source and the cathode bootstrap minimizes hum pickup.|$|R
50|$|Prototypes were raced in late 1949 and {{the last}} model was {{produced}} in 1952. The small numbers produced mean that {{there was plenty of}} variation of the specification. Earlier models were finished with chrome on the fuel tank and lower <b>fork</b> <b>link</b> but towards the end of production in 1952 this was replaced by grey paint. As well as the Burman BAR gearbox, Vincent also experimented with AJS 7R gearboxes but used Albion gearboxes for most of the machines produced.|$|R
50|$|The AJS Silver Streak was a British {{motorcycle}} {{launched in}} 1938 and {{described in the}} sales brochure as the 'aristocrats of the motor-cycle world'. Produced {{with a choice of}} 250 cc, 350 cc and 500 cc engines, the Silver Streaks were super sport machines with a special polished finish and hand tuned engines. As many parts as possible were specially chrome plated, including the mudguards, headlamp, <b>fork</b> <b>links,</b> front and rear chain cases, oil and petrol tanks and even the tool-box.|$|R

50|$|In the 1986 and 1990 {{standards}} {{the use of}} {{the second}} data pair is not defined other than as an ‘optional second data link’ both unidirectional and bidirectional use were envisioned. Other proprietary uses have been implemented for these pins. Schemes that use voltage outside of the range allowed by EIA485 are disallowed. Guidance on allowed usage can be found in Annex B of E1.11. Current standard practice is to leave the secondary data <b>link</b> <b>pins</b> unused.|$|R

On 23 December the Road Bridge reopened for all traffic except heavy goods vehicles (HGVs).

5000|$|Double linking is an {{organizing}} principle developed by Gerard Endenburg, a Dutch engineer, {{as part of}} the so-called sociocratic circular method. It operates as an extension of Rensis Likert's (single) <b>linking</b> <b>pin.</b> In the sociocratic approach, decision-making is structured in circles. Each circle is connected to the next higher circle by way of the functional leader (appointed in the next higher circle) and a representative chosen in the circle. Both the functional leader and the representative participate in policy decisions taken in the lower as well as higher circle.|$|R

We derived a cam profile {{as a function}} of certain parameters using the constraints of the bar <b>links,</b> <b>pinned</b> joints, and ranges of motion. Once this cam profile function was derived, we designed four cam profiles and investigated the moments of each. A cam that equalized the moment (or torque) and a cam that constrained the standard deviation of incremental work to be zero were included. Finally, we computed the radius of curvature for the cam profile...|$|R
