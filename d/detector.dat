5|$|Gallium is {{used for}} {{neutrino}} detection. Possibly the largest amount of pure gallium ever collected in a single spot is the Gallium-Germanium Neutrino Telescope used by the SAGE experiment at the Baksan Neutrino Observatory in Russia. This <b>detector</b> contains 55–57 tonnes of liquid gallium. Another experiment was the GALLEX neutrino <b>detector</b> operated in the early 1990s in an Italian mountain tunnel. The <b>detector</b> contained 12.2 tons of watered gallium-71. Solar neutrinos caused a few atoms of 71Ga to become radioactive 71Ge, which were detected. This experiment showed that the solar neutrino flux is 40% less than theory predicted. This deficit was not explained until better solar neutrino detectors and theories were constructed (see SNO).|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} the {{accuracy and precision}} of commercially available radon <b>detectors</b> in a field setting, 15 <b>detectors</b> from six companies were exposed to radon and compared to a reference radon level. The <b>detectors</b> from companies that had already passed National Radon Measurement Proficiency Program testing had better precision and accuracy than those <b>detectors</b> awaiting proficiency testing. Charcoal adsorption <b>detectors</b> and diffusion barrier charcoal adsorption <b>detectors</b> performed very well, and the latter <b>detectors</b> displayed excellent time averaging ability.

5|$|Liquid xenon {{is used in}} calorimeters {{to measure}} gamma rays, and as a <b>detector</b> of {{hypothetical}} weakly interacting massive particles, or WIMPs. When a WIMP collides with a xenon nucleus, theory predicts it will impart enough energy to cause ionization and scintillation. Liquid xenon is useful for these experiments because its density makes dark matter interaction more likely and it permits a quiet <b>detector</b> through self-shielding.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} {{americium}} {{in a typical}} new smoke <b>detector</b> is 1microcurie (37kBq) or 0.29 microgram. This amount declines slowly as the americium decays into neptunium-237, a different transuranic element with a much longer half-life (about 2.14 million years). With its half-life of 432.2 years, the americium in a smoke <b>detector</b> includes about 3% neptunium after 19 years, and about 5% after 32 years. The radiation passes through an ionization chamber, an air-filled space between two electrodes, and permits a small, constant current between the electrodes. Any smoke that enters the chamber absorbs the alpha particles, which reduces the ionization and affects this current, triggering the alarm. Compared to the alternative optical smoke <b>detector,</b> the ionization smoke <b>detector</b> is cheaper and can detect particles which {{are too small to}} produce significant light scattering; however, it is more prone to false alarms.|$|E
25|$|A LEED <b>detector</b> usually {{contains}} {{three or}} four hemispherical concentric grids and a phosphor screen or other position-sensitive <b>detector.</b> The grids are used for screening out the inelastically scattered electrons.

25|$|The most {{advanced}} {{type of a}} <b>detector</b> is the RICH, or Ring-imaging Cherenkov <b>detector,</b> developed in the 1980s. In a RICH <b>detector,</b> a cone of Cherenkov light is produced when a high speed charged particle traverses a suitable medium, often called radiator. This light cone is detected on a position sensitive planar photon <b>detector,</b> which allows reconstructing a ring or disc, the radius {{of which is a}} measure for the Cherenkov emission angle. Both focusing and proximity-focusing detectors are in use. In a focusing RICH <b>detector,</b> the photons are collected by a spherical mirror and focused onto the photon <b>detector</b> placed at the focal plane. The result is a circle with a radius independent of the emission point along the particle track. This scheme is suitable for low refractive index radiators—i.e. gases—due to the larger radiator length needed to create enough photons. In the more compact proximity-focusing design, a thin radiator volume emits a cone of Cherenkov light which traverses a small distance—the proximity gap—and is detected on the photon <b>detector</b> plane. The image is a ring of light, the radius of which is defined by the Cherenkov emission angle and the proximity gap. The ring thickness is determined by the thickness of the radiator. An example of a proximity gap RICH <b>detector</b> is the High Momentum Particle Identification <b>Detector</b> (HMPID), a <b>detector</b> currently under construction for ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment), one of the six experiments at the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN.|$|E

25|$|Not all {{gamma rays}} emitted by the source that {{pass through the}} <b>detector</b> will produce a count in the system. The {{probability}} that an emitted gamma ray will interact with the <b>detector</b> and produce a count is {{the efficiency of the}} <b>detector.</b> High-efficiency detectors produce spectra in less time than low-efficiency detectors. In general, larger detectors have higher efficiency than smaller detectors, although the shielding properties of the <b>detector</b> material are also important factors. <b>Detector</b> efficiency is measured by comparing a spectrum from a source of known activity to the count rates in each peak to the count rates expected from the known intensities of each gamma ray.|$|E
40|$|The {{successful}} {{development of}} lithium-drifted Ge <b>detectors</b> in the 1960 's {{marked the beginning}} of the significant use of semiconductor crystals for direct detection and spectroscopy of gamma rays. In the 1970 's, high-purity Ge became available, which enabled the production of complex <b>detectors</b> and multi-detector systems. In the following decades, the technology of semiconductor gamma-ray <b>detectors</b> continued to advance, with significant developments not only in Ge <b>detectors</b> but also in Si <b>detectors</b> and room-temperature compound-semiconductor <b>detectors.</b> In recent years, our group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has developed a variety of gamma ray <b>detectors</b> based on these semiconductor materials. Examples include Ge strip <b>detectors,</b> lithium-drifted Si strip <b>detectors,</b> and coplanar-grid CdZnTe <b>detectors.</b> These advances provide new capabilities in the measurement of gamma rays, such as the ability to perform imaging and the realization of highly compact spectroscopy systems...|$|R
