5|$|Leroux {{was one of}} 21 {{professional}} athletes featured in ESPN's The Body Issue in 2013. She appeared semi-nude on one of eight covers for the magazine. Of the experience she said, I {{think a lot of}} females struggle with the way they look, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that everyone's body is different. I think it's a big deal to be an athlete and feel confident in your body and show it off. I'm not going to say I've never struggled with how I look, but I've reached a point in my life where I'm happy with who I am.|$|E
5|$|Hopsin {{detailed}} the album to The Source saying, There's {{a variety of}} music on there. There's crazy, wild lyrics. There's sad, emotional lyrics and even funny lyrics. I got serious songs and sad songs. Just a big variety of everything. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> the full me. I {{have a lot of}} people who love me, but I have a lot of haters as well. There are at least one or two songs for someone that doesn't really like me or what I put out. I think they'll stumble across a couple songs that will make them go, oh ok, I fucks with him now. I kinda wanted to make an album to show my wide range of music that I can do. I just wanted to show the full me.|$|E
5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

I know that there's so many women that feel the same thing after they give birth. You can have your child and you can still have fun and still be sexy and still have dreams and still live for yourself. I'm not embarrassed about it, and I don't feel like I have to protect that side of me because I do believe that {{sexuality}} is a power we all have." ...|$|E

His goal that he was aiming for in this project was, [...] "to make audiences understand there should be other styles of animation beyond the existing two primary kinds of animation presented—precisely cel-drawing 2D style and CG 3D style. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that creators are not limited, that they have many options for different (animation) styles to create stories." ...|$|E

No matter what the result the motivation was {{for people to understand}} about MacArthur. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> how MacArthur loved God and loved people. MacArthur came to Japan after World War II and put the nation back together. He really respected and loved the people.

500|$|With Indicud, {{on several}} tracks Cudi took a {{backseat}} in vocals to rather showcase his production skills. [...] "The {{focus was on}} producing the record for Kendrick, I wanted to shine as a producer first. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that side off {{more than anything else}} and that's why I had my one verse then let Kendrick go ape-sh-- crazy all over the rest of it." [...] As for the A$AP Rocky feature on [...] "Brothers," [...] Cudi explained that he made the decision to go with a minimal hook and let the Harlem rapper dominate the track: [...] "I felt like that was a perfect beat for A$AP to get on there and speak some truths and talk to the younger generation, because he's in a place where a lot of kids are up to him and Kendrick. I just wanted to hear him say something a little bit more thoughtful, and he did that — he showed up. I was blown away by his craftsmanship, his professionalism and his overall mojo." ...|$|E
500|$|Other critics labeled Juno as feminist {{because of}} its {{portrayal}} of Juno as a confident and intelligent teenage girl. Antifeminist Phyllis Schlafly wrote that Junos theme [...] "isn't love, romance, or respect for life, but the triumph of feminist ideology, i.e., the irrelevancy of men, especially fathers."

[...] Cody said about writing the film, [...] "Women are clever, women are funny, women are sharp, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that these girls were human and not the stereotypical teenage girls that we often see in the media" [...] and [...] "There {{was a lack of}} authentic teen girl characters ... I saw writing this screenplay as an opportunity to create an iconic female." [...] Page praised the film for its positive depiction of teenage girls, describing Juno's character as [...] "really refreshing and allow for new possibilities in what young women can be" [...] and [...] "honest but original, completely devoid of stereotype", while also highlighting that [...] "Girls haven't had that sort of character before. We don't have our Catcher in the Rye." [...] She criticized the media perception of her character as a [...] "strong woman", arguing that if Juno were a male character, the [...] "strength" [...] of the character would not be considered remarkable. Reitman was interested in the personal/political conflict for Vanessa's character: [...] "Feminism has paved the way for Vanessa’s career, but ultimately Vanessa wants to be a full time mother." ...|$|E
