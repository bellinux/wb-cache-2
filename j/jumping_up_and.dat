25|$|Fancher {{states that}} radical hermeneutics, {{which is similar}} to but {{different}} from ontological hermeneutics, may end up being a kind of Trojan horse for psychotherapy because its emphasis on subjective narrative and deconstruction can lend itself to a dangerous relativism. He likens it to a small boy <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down on the diving board of an empty pool: what starts out in innocence is likely to end up in disaster.|$|E

500|$|Beyoncé's vocals were {{recorded}} at the KMA Studio in New York City. When the trio played Beyoncé the demo of [...] "Best Thing I Never Had", she immediately approved it after making slight modifications. Smith says that Beyoncé was literally <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down {{after hearing the}} demo. One hour later Beyoncé recorded [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] and two other songs. Smith recalled that Beyoncé focused solely on the recording, ignoring hunger as she worked into the night. Beyoncé has stated that every man and woman can relate to the song's subject matter because at one point, almost everyone ends a relationship {{because of lack of}} commitment by his or her partner.|$|E

I was wearing trainers again—I learnt from the day before that I needed to bandage my feet up so they couldn't expand anymore! We couldn't play music on the street so I was wearing an ear piece with my track playing. Loads of people were stopping and looking at me like I'd lost it, <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down to what they thought was no music playing! Gotta do what you gotta do! Everyone worked so hard in getting the video together considering the conditions, I was really grateful! ...|$|E
500|$|Results May Vary was {{released}} on September 23, 2003, and received largely unfavorable reviews. Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine panned the album, writing, [...] "the music has no melody, hooks, or energy, [...] all {{attention is focused on}} the clown <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down and screaming in front, and long before the record is over, you're left wondering, how the hell did he ever get to put this mess out?" [...] The Guardian reviewer Caroline Sullivan wrote, [...] "At least Limp Bizkit can't be accused of festering in the rap-rock ghetto [...] But Durst's problems are ever-present – and does anybody still care?" [...] Despite criticisms of the album, it was a commercial success, peaking at No.3 on the Billboard 200.|$|E

Am I crazy? Am I crazy? Am I crazy?" [...] After the play, Riegels was so distraught {{that he had to}} be talked into {{returning}} to the game by coach Nibs Price for the second half. Roy said [...] "Coach, I can't do it. I've ruined you, I've ruined myself, I've ruined the University of California. I couldn't face that crowd to save my life." [...] Coach Price responded by saying [...] "Roy, get up and go back out there — the game is only half over." ...|$|E
500|$|Zeta's Lad trainer John Upson {{was among}} those {{trainers}} who were particularly angry, feeling, correctly as it transpired, that this was his only {{chance to have a}} leading contender in a National. Before the race Upson had said: [...] "I'm not someone who always thinks their horse is going to win, but this year I just have a feeling." [...] The horse was in mid-division taking the water jump but was instantly pulled up as jockey Robbie Supple, riding in his third National, realised the race was not on. Upson later revealed: [...] "The reason I really blew my top was, that once the initial fiasco had happened, there was the starter standing there saying, 'Right, I'm disqualifying everything, apart from the nine that didn't go. I'll start the race again with nine runners.' At that stage I just thought the world had gone completely mad. The adrenaline was going and I was <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down." ...|$|E
500|$|Monteux {{believed}} {{that most of}} the anger aroused by the work was due not to the music but to Nijinsky's choreography, described by Stravinsky as [...] "knock-kneed and long-haired Lolitas <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down". With the composer's agreement Monteux presented a concert performance in Paris in April 1914. Saint-Saëns, who was present, declared Stravinsky mad and left in a rage, but he was almost alone in his dislike. At the end Stravinsky was carried shoulder-high from the theatre after what he described as [...] "the most beautiful performance that I have had of the Sacre du printemps". That performance was part of a series of [...] "Concerts Monteux", presented between February and April 1914, in which Monteux conducted the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées {{in a wide range of}} symphonic and concertante works, including the concert premiere of the orchestral version of Ravel's Valses nobles et sentimentales. His last notable engagement before the outbreak of war was as conductor of the premiere of Stravinsky's opera The Nightingale at the Palais Garnier.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} of Results May Vary was mainly negative. The album received [...] "generally unfavorable reviews" [...] on Metacritic, {{with a score}} of 33 out of 100. This is the second lowest score on Metacritic, above only Kevin Federline's album Playing with Fire. According to AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, [...] "the music has no melody, hooks, or energy, [...] all {{attention is focused on}} the clown <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down and screaming in front, and long before the record is over, you're left wondering, how the hell did he ever get to put this mess out?". In a review of Limp Bizkit's Greatest Hitz compilation, Erlewine called [...] "Behind Blue Eyes" [...] the worst in the band's [...] "never-ending series of embarrassing covers". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Durst's problems are ever-present - and does anybody still care?". Stylus criticized Results May Vary, calling it [...] "an album that {{can only be described as}} abysmal". Rob O'Connor of Yahoo! Launch also criticized Results May Vary: [...] "No, Fred, the results don't vary. The results are consistent throughout your new album—consistently crappy." [...] Kitty Empire of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Limp Bizkit have decided to expose their tender side. They really shouldn't have bothered [...] having seen Limp Bizkit's 'other side', you want the old, unapologetic, meathead version back". Scott Mervis of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also criticized Results May Vary: [...] "Results May Vary has a few highlights — 'Almost Over' (very Everlast) and 'Phenomenon' (very Primus) — but way too few to justify all the time and energy spent".|$|E
500|$|American {{recording}} artist Kanye West {{also contributed to}} three tracks on the album; Madonna called him [...] "the black Madonna" [...] and said, [...] "We're comrades in the envelope-pushing genre". Madonna said, [...] "It's {{a little bit of}} a bullfight, but we take turns. He knows that he's walking into a room with a person with a strong point of view, and I do, too. I listen to what he has to say, take it in, and he listens to what I say and takes it in. We didn't agree on everything, but he has good ideas." [...] She told Rolling Stone that of the songs she played him, West connected the most with [...] "Illuminati" [...] and that, [...] "e loved the melody, and he was actually <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down on the soundboard. He literally stood on top of the mixing board—we were worried he was going to hit his head on the ceiling, but he didn't. He ended up being very excited about that track, and then he added his spin to it, musically, and I love it. To me, he elevated the lyrics with the music. It's like a siren, alerting people." [...] In December 2014, thirteen demos of tracks for the album, including [...] "Illuminati", were leaked to the Internet. To avoid further leaks, Madonna released six completed tracks, including the final version of [...] "Illuminati" [...] with the addition of West's writing and production, with the pre-order for the album on the iTunes Store on December 20, 2014, as an [...] "early Christmas gift".|$|E

Removable bleachers were also added {{to the east and}} west ends of the fieldhouse, expanding the capacity of the court. All the bleachers featured wider walkways and new handrails for enhanced safety. The cost of the replacement, planned for August 2011, was $370,000 (paid for out of the school district's maintenance fund).|$|E
