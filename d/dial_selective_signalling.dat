In both groups, vocal {{learning in}}cludes a perceptual phase during which juveniles birds and infants memorize adult vocalizations. Despite intensive research, the neural mechanisms supporting this auditory memory are still poorly understood. The present functional MRI study demonstrates that in adult zebra finches, the right auditory midbrain nucleus responds selectively to the copied vocalizations. The <b>selective</b> <b>signal</b> {{is distinct from}} selectivity for the bird's own song and does not simply reflect acoustic differences between the stimuli. Furthermore, the amplitude of the <b>selective</b> <b>signal</b> is positively correlated with the strength of vocal learning, measured {{by the amount of}} song that experimental birds copied from the adult model.

Selective {{agonists}} and antagonists of gonadotropin receptors would be of great interest for the treatment of infertility or as non steroidal contraceptive. However, to date, only native hormones are being used in assisted reproduction technologies as there is no pharmacological agent available to manipulate gonadotropin receptors. Over the last decade, there has been a growing perception of the complexity associated with gonadotropin receptors’ cellular signaling. It is now clear that the Gs/cAMP/PKA pathway is not the sole mechanism that must be taken into account in order to understand these hormones’ biological actions. In parallel, consistent with the emerging paradigm of biased agonism, several examples of ligand-mediated <b>selective</b> <b>signaling</b> pathway activation by gonadotropin receptors have been reported.

40|$|Protease-activated {{receptor}}- 1 (PAR 1) is a G-protein–coupled receptor uniquely {{activated by}} proteolysis. Thrombin, a coagulant protease, induces inflammatory responses and endothelial barrier permeability through the activation of PAR 1. Activated protein C (APC), an anti-coagulant protease, also activates PAR 1. However, unlike thrombin, APC elicits anti-inflammatory responses and protects against endothelial barrier dysfunction induced by thrombin. We found that thrombin and APC signaling {{were lost in}} PAR 1 -deficient endothelial cells, indicating that PAR 1 is the major effector of protease signaling. To delineate the mechanism responsible for protease-selective signaling by PAR 1, we examined the effect of APC and thrombin on the activation of RhoA and Rac 1, small GTPases that differentially regulate endothelial barrier permeability. Thrombin caused robust RhoA signaling but not Rac 1 activation, whereas APC stimulated a marked increase in Rac 1 activation but not RhoA signaling, consistent with the opposing functions of these proteases on endothelial barrier integrity. Strikingly, APC signaling and endothelial barrier protection effects were abolished in cells lacking caveolin- 1, whereas thrombin signaling remained intact. These findings suggest that compartmentalization of PAR 1 in caveolae is critical for APC <b>selective</b> <b>signaling</b> to Rac 1 activation and endothelial barrier protection. We further report that APC induces PAR 1 phosphorylation and desensitizes endothelial cells to thrombin signaling but promotes limited receptor cleavage and negligible internalization and degradation even after prolonged APC exposure. Thus, APC <b>selective</b> <b>signaling</b> and endothelial barrier protective effects are mediated through compartmentalization of PAR 1 in caveolae and a novel mechanism of PAR 1 signal regulation...|$|R

Fidelity was thought to arise from the inability of SRP to bind strongly to incorrect cargos.

40|$|Insulin {{exhibits}} pleiotropic {{effects that}} are tissue- {{as well as}} development-dependent. However, the mechanisms by which insulin gains selective effects are poorly understood. Selectivity in insulin signaling is currently discussed {{as the result of}} the activation of specific signal transduction pathways. This may be gained by activating specific adapter proteins, such as IRS proteins and Shc, that 'channel' the insulin signal in a more defined way by specifically interacting with downstream located effector proteins. The insulin receptor (IR), the first step in these cascades, exists in two isoforms as a result of alternative mRNA splicing of the 11 th exon of the pro-receptor transcript. IR-A lacks whereas IR-B contains the respective sequence coding for 12 amino acids in the C-terminus of the a-chain of the receptor. Studies on general and tissue-specific IR knockout models have demonstrated that a defect IR-mediated insulin signaling leads to a type 2 diabetes-like phenotype. However, these knockouts do not discriminate between the two IR isoforms. Besides their different affinity for insulin, differences in kinase activity as well as internalization and recycling for IR-A and IR-B have been described. These data implied differences in the function of either IR isoform. Although all cell types express both isoforms to a various degree, little is known about the mechanisms that underlie IR isoform-specific signaling and their biological importance remains obscure. Besides the classical insulin target tissues liver, muscle and fat, recent research disclosed the pancreatic P-cell as an important target for pleiotropic insulin action, here involving signal transduction through IR and IGF-I receptors. The overall objective of the present thesis work was to test the hypothesis that the two IR isoforms contribute to <b>selective</b> insulin <b>signaling.</b> Specifically, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms that allow simultaneous and selective transcriptional activation of three model genes encoding insulin, beta-cell glucokinase (betaGK) and c-fos by insulin signal transduction via the two IR isoforms in the pancreatic P-cell. We show here that insulin activates the transcription of these three genes by different mechanisms. Insulin activates transcription of its own gene by signaling via IR-A and IRS/P 13 K la/mTOR/p 70 s 6 k. In contrast, betaGK and c-fos genes are activated by insulin signaling via IR-B but employing different signaling cascades. While insulin-stimulated betaGK promoter up-regulation requires the integrity of the IR-B NPEY-motif and signaling via PI 3 K-C 2 alphaPDK 1 /PKB, c-fos gene activation needs the intact YTHM-motif and signaling via P 13 K la/p 52 -Shc/MEK 1 /ERK 1 / 2. Studying the molecular mechanisms that underlie the <b>selective</b> <b>signaling</b> via IR-A versus IR-B, we found that both IR-A-mediated insulin and IRB-mediated betaGK promoter activation are not dependent on IR isoform-specific differences in internalization but on their spatial segregation in the plasma membrane. Our data demonstrate that localization and function of the two receptor types depend on the 12 amino acids encoded by exon 11. Moreover, our data suggest that selective activation of the insulin and betaGK promoters occurs by signaling from non-caveolae plasma membrane micro-domains that are differently sensitive towards cholesterol depletion. Analyzing the mechanisms that allow activation of <b>selective</b> <b>signaling</b> cascades downstream of IR-B, we found that insulin activates the betaGK promoter from membrane-standing IR-B, while c-fos promoter activation is dependent on clathrin-mediated IR-B endocytosis. In conclusion, the results of the present thesis work clearly demonstrate that spatial segregation of <b>selective</b> <b>signaling</b> pathways originating from IR-A and IR-B allows the simultaneous activation of discrete signaling cascades that lead to specific insulin effects...|$|R
