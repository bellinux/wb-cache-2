40|$|Experience {{during the}} past 6 years of {{operation}} of the 0. 3 -meter transonic cryogenic tunnel at the NASA Langley Research Center has shown that there are problems associated with efficient operation and control of cryogenic tunnels using manual control schemes. This {{is due to the}} high degree of process crosscoupling between the independent control variables (<b>temperature,</b> <b>pressure,</b> <b>and</b> fan drive speed) and the desired test condition (Mach number and Reynolds number). One problem has been the inability to maintain long-term accurate control of the test parameters. Additionally, the time required to change from one test condition to another has proven to be excessively long and much less efficient than desirable in terms of liquid nitrogen and electrical power usage. For these reasons, studies have been undertaken to: (1) develop and validate a mathematical model of the 0. 3 -meter cryogenic tunnel process, (2) utilize this model in a hybrid computer simulation to <b>design</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> <b>pressure</b> feedback control laws, and (3) evaluate the adequacy of these control schemes by analysis of closed-loop experimental data.

GODU-LH 2 has three main objectives: zero-loss storage and transfer, liquefaction, and densification of liquid hydrogen. A cryogenic refrigerator has been integrated into an existing, previously certified, 33, 000 gallon vacuum-jacketed storage vessel built by Minnesota Valley Engineering in 1991 for the Titan program.

40|$|Dynamic {{pressure}} measurements were taken during flame-tube emissions testing of three second-generation swirl-venturi lean direct injection (SV-LDI) combustor configurations. These measurements show that combustion dynamics were typically small. However, {{a small number}} of points showed high combustion dynamics, with peak-to-peak dynamic pressure fluctuations above 0. 5 psi. High combustion dynamics occurred at low inlet temperatures in all three SV-LDI configurations, so combustion dynamics were explored further at low temperature conditions. A point with greater than 1. 5 psi peak-to-peak dynamic pressure fluctuations was identified at an inlet temperature of 450 !F, a pressure of 100 psia, an air pressure drop of 3 %, and an overall equivalence ratio of 0. 35. This is an off <b>design</b> condition: the <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> <b>pressure</b> are typical of 7 % power conditions, but the equivalence ratio is high. At this condition, the combustion dynamics depended strongly on the fuel staging.

40|$|The Modular Pebble Bed Reactor system (MPBR) {{requires}} a gas turbine cycle (Brayton cycle) {{as the power}} conversion system for it to achieve economic competitiveness as a Generation IV nuclear system. The availability of controllable helium turbomachinery and compact heat exchangers are thus the critical enabling technology for the gas turbine cycle. The development of an initial reference design for an indirect helium cycle has been accomplished with the overriding constraint that this design could be built with existing technology and complies with all current codes and standards. Using the initial reference design, limiting features were identified. Finally, an optimized reference design was developed by identifying key advances in the technology that could reasonably {{be expected to be}} achieved with limited R&D. This final reference design is an indirect, intercooled and recuperated cycle consisting of a three-shaft arrangement for the turbomachinery system. A critical part of the design process involved the interaction between individual component design and overall plant performance. The helium cycle overall efficiency is significantly influenced by performance of individual components. Changes in the design of one component, a turbine for example, often required changes in other components. To allow for the optimization of the overall design with these interdependencies, a detailed steady state and transient control model was developed. The use of the steady state and transient models as a part of an iterative design process represents a key contribution of this work. A dynamic model, MPBRSim, has been developed. The model integrates the reactor core and the power conversion system simultaneously. Physical parameters such as the heat exchangers; weights and practical performance maps such as the turbine characteristics and compressor characteristics are incorporated into the model. The individual component models as well as the fully integrated model of the power conversion system have been verified with an industry-standard general thermal-fluid code Flownet. With respect to the dynamic model, bypass valve control and inventory control have been used as the primary control methods for the power conversion system. By performing simulation using the dynamic model with the designed control scheme, the combination of bypass and inventory control was optimized to assure system stability within <b>design</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> <b>pressure</b> limits. Bypass control allows for rapid control system response while inventory control allows for ultimate steady state operation at part power very near the optimum operating point for the system. Load transients simulations show that the indirect, three-shaft arrangement gas turbine power conversion system is stable and controllable. For the indirect cycle the intermediate heat exchanger (IHX) is the interface between the reactor and the turbomachinery systems. As a part of the design effort the IHX was identified as the key component in the system. Two technologies, printed circuit and compact plate-fin, were investigated that have the promise of meeting the design requirements for the system. The reference design incorporates the possibility of using either technology although the compact plate-fin design was chosen for subsequent analysis. The thermal design and parametric analysis with an IHX and recuperator using the plate-fin configuration have been performed. As a three-shaft arrangement, the turbo-shaft sets consist of a pair of turbine/compressor sets (high <b>pressure</b> <b>and</b> low <b>pressure</b> turbines with same-shaft compressor) and a power turbine coupled with a synchronous generator. The turbines and compressors are all axial type and the shaft configuration is horizontal.

40|$|A {{process flow}} sheet for the {{production}} of hydrogen to run a 50 kW fuel-cell-powered-vehicle by steam reforming of naphtha is presented. The major units in the flow sheet involve a desulfurization unit, a steam reformer, a low temperature (LT) shift reactor, a methanation reactor, and a membrane separator unit. The flow sheet is simulated using HYSYS (a steady state simulator) and the material and energy flows for each stream are obtained. For the peak load of 50 kW, it is found that 14 l/h naphtha is needed, which means that a 70 l fuel tank in the vehicle is sufficient for 5 h drive. The amount of water needed is not a critical factor, since it is generated in the fuel cell and quantities of water-makeup can be kept at the minimum level. Catalytic processes involved are briefly reviewed and commercial catalysts used are indicated. The amount of catalyst required in each reactive unit is computed by employing the <b>design</b> parameters (<b>temperature,</b> <b>pressure,</b> <b>and</b> space velocities) reported in the literature. In the desulfurization step, it is found that about 1. 6 l of a bed of ZnO is capable of handling a stream of naphtha with 1500 ppm of sulfur for 45 h of continuous operation before regeneration or replacement of the bed becomes necessary. This, however, is based on operation at 10 atm. Operation at lower pressure level will increase the desulfurization catalyst requirements, maybe to a prohibitive level. Over the reformer Liquid-Hourly Space-Velocity range of 1 – 4 h- 1, the amount of the supported nickel catalyst varies from 14 to 4 l, respectively. For the LT shift reactor the amount of catalyst required ranges from 4 to 60 l on going from 3 × 10 ^ 2 to 4 × 10 ^ 3 h- 1 typical Gas-Hourly Space-Velocity. The catalyst here is CuO–ZnO supported on Al 2 O 3. The last methanation step to remove traces of poisonous CO requires about 3. 5 l of nickel supported by various oxides. To selectively separate hydrogen, it is suggested to use a palladium–silver membrane, which is reported to give ultra-pure hydrogen. ...|$|R
