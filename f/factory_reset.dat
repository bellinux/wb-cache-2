2500|$|Chrome OS {{uses the}} same release system as Google Chrome: there are three {{distinct}} channels: Stable, Beta, and Developer preview (called the [...] "Dev" [...] channel). The stable channel is updated with features and fixes that have been thoroughly tested in the Beta channel, and the Beta channel is updated approximately once a month with stable and complete features from the Developer channel. New ideas get tested in the Developer channel, which can be very unstable at times. A fourth canary channel was confirmed to exist by Google Developer Francois Beaufort and hacker Kenny Strawn, by entering the Chrome OS shell in developer mode, typing the command [...] to access the bash shell, and finally entering the command [...] It is possible to return to verified boot mode after entering the canary channel, but the channel updater disappears {{and the only way}} to return to another channel is using the [...] "powerwash" [...] <b>factory</b> <b>reset.</b>|$|E

5000|$|... "Refresh" [...] or [...] "Reset" [...] (Windows 8 and later): Both re-install Windows from {{a copy of}} the {{operating}} system on the hard drive. The [...] "Refresh" [...] operation maintains files, settings, and Windows Store apps (but not other programs), while [...] "Reset" [...] performs a <b>factory</b> <b>reset</b> of Windows, optionally formatting the hard drive and performing disk wiping. The Reset function does not perform a full reinstall; it merely performs a <b>factory</b> <b>reset</b> from a WIM image inside a hidden recovery partition. It is possible to create a custom WIM image based on which a Reset is performed.|$|E

40|$|Mobile devices usually {{provide a}} “factory-reset ” tool to erase user-specific {{data from the}} main {{secondary}} storage. 9 Apple iPhones, 10 Android devices, and 2 BlackBerry devices were tested in the first systematic evaluation {{of the effectiveness of}} <b>factory</b> <b>resets.</b> Tests used the Cellebrite UME- 36 Pro with the UFED Physical Analyzer, the Bulk Extractor open-source tool, and our own programs for extracting metadata, classifying file paths, and comparing them between images. Two phones were subjected to more detailed analysis. Results showed that many kinds of data were removed by the resets, but much user-specific configuration data was left. Android devices did poorly at removing user documents and media, and occasional surprising user data was left on all devices including photo images, audio, documents, phone numbers, email addresses, geolocation data, configuration data, and keys. A conclusion is that reset devices can still provide some useful information to a forensic investigation...|$|R
500|$|The {{closure of}} Cox's Pill Factory, the Kemp Town branch {{line and the}} nearby Vogue cinema in the 1970s and early 1980s {{prompted}} large-scale redevelopment. [...] Between 1983 and 1985, a large area around the junction of Lewes and Upper Lewes Roads was cleared in favour of the Vogue Gyratory system and a Sainsbury's supermarket. [...] The Vogue Gyratory, a major road junction connecting Upper Lewes Road, Lewes Road, Bear Road and Hollingdean Road, opened in mid-1984. Sainsbury's was completed and opened on 23 April 1985; its design featured round-arched exterior arcades which recalled the recently demolished viaduct, and the clock was retrieved from the demolished pill <b>factory</b> and <b>reset</b> on {{the exterior of the}} new building. [...] It won Brighton Council's design award in 1985.|$|R
50|$|A <b>factory</b> <b>reset,</b> {{also known}} as master reset, is a {{software}} restore of an electronic device to its original system state by erasing {{all of the information}} stored on the device in an attempt to restore the device’s software to its original manufacturer settings. Doing so will effectively erase all of the data, settings, and applications that were previously on the device. This is often done to fix a software issue that a device is facing, but it could also be done to restore the device to its original settings. Such electronic devices include handheld computers such as PDAs and mobile phones. Since a <b>factory</b> <b>reset</b> entails deleting all information stored in the device, it is essentially the same concept as reformatting a hard drive. Pre-Installed applications and data on the card's storage card (such as a MicroSD card) will not be erased. A <b>factory</b> <b>reset</b> should be performed with caution, as it effectively destroys all data stored in the unit. Factory resets can often fix many chronic performance issues such as freezing and will not remove the device's operating system.|$|E
50|$|Other {{problems}} were experienced by some Xperia E4 users who complained that their device battery life drained too quickly despite stamina mode being enabled. To {{resolve the issue}} the device had to be soft (<b>factory)</b> <b>reset</b> by the user.|$|E
50|$|Note: a <b>factory</b> <b>reset</b> {{may only}} hide {{data from the}} {{operating}} system so it appears it no longer exists. This {{is not the same}} effect as data deletion, and may not therefore be wholly suitable in situations where the device changes ownership.|$|E
5000|$|On Android devices {{there is}} a <b>factory</b> data <b>reset</b> option in Settings->Back up and reset that will appear to erase all of the device's data and reset all of its settings. This method is {{typically}} used when the device has an issue that cannot be fixed using other methods, or when the owner wants to destroy their personal data before selling the device. After performing a study, Avast! reported that the data is recoverable using [...] "fairly generic" [...] and [...] "publicly available" [...] forensics software. [...] The [...] "Factory data reset" [...] option {{has no effect on}} the Knox Flag. As such, it does not reset the device to its original factory settings and is not a way to return the device to a state compatible with the manufacturer's warranty. Data on the SIM card and the MicroSD card are not erased.|$|R
50|$|A {{cloud service}} backed up all {{personal}} data like settings, planner, notes, calendar, photos and all contacts. It was accessible and also editable {{on a web}} interface. A <b>factory</b> <b>reset</b> or new device was able to restore all personal data by signing in with username and password.|$|E
50|$|Many {{electronic}} devices have a menu with tools and settings called the service menu. The service menu commonly includes {{a tool that}} performs a <b>factory</b> <b>reset.</b> This tool is most common in devices with displays, such as television sets and computer monitors. These menus are usually accessed through a sequence of button presses.|$|E
50|$|Factory resets can be {{achieved}} {{in a variety of}} ways depending on the electronic device. For some devices, this could be done by going into the device's service menu. Other devices may require a complete re-installation of the software. The following section lists a few common electronic devices and how they can be <b>factory</b> <b>reset.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Shedun-family malware {{is known}} for auto-rooting the Android OS [...] using {{well-known}} exploits like ExynosAbuse, Memexploit and Framaroot [...] (causing a potential privilege escalation) and for serving trojanized adware and install themselves within the system partition of the operating system, so that not even a <b>factory</b> <b>reset</b> can remove the malware from infected devices.|$|E
50|$|On May 3, 2010, Google {{announced}} that they would start to phase out the googlemail.com domain in the UK. Existing users will get the option to switch to gmail.com, while new users {{will be given a}} gmail.com address by default. This also required Android phone users to perform a <b>factory</b> <b>reset</b> (requiring a back-up to prevent data loss) to restore phone functionality.|$|E
50|$|A multi-instance object may be writable or read-only, {{depending}} on what it represents. Writable objects allow dynamic creation and removal of their children. For example, if an object represents four physical ports on an Ethernet switch, then {{it should not be}} possible to add or remove them from the data model. If an instance is added to an object, an identifier is assigned. After being assigned, identifiers cannot change during the life-cycle of the device, except by <b>factory</b> <b>reset.</b>|$|E
50|$|As {{more complex}} {{features}} {{are added to}} phones, they become more vulnerable to viruses which exploit weaknesses in these features. Even text messages {{can be used in}} attacks by worms and viruses. Advanced phones capable of e-mail can be susceptible to viruses that can multiply by sending messages through a phone's address book. In some phone models, the USSD was exploited for inducing a <b>factory</b> <b>reset,</b> resulting in clearing the data and resetting the user settings.|$|E
50|$|The Xbox One system software, {{sometimes}} called the Xbox OS, is the operating system for the eighth-generation home video game console, Xbox One. It is a Windows-based operating system using the Hyper-V virtual machine monitor and contains separate operating systems for games and applications that can run on the console. It {{is located on the}} internal HDD for day-to-day usage, while also being duplicated on the internal NAND storage of the console for recovery purposes and <b>factory</b> <b>reset</b> functionality.|$|E
5000|$|The Push-button reset {{function}} {{has been}} changed to utilize files from the current Windows installation to rebuild the system rather than a separate recovery image. System updates carry over into the new installation {{and do not have}} to be re-downloaded. The separate [...] "Refresh" [...] option is removed; users are now given explicit choices within the Reset process to remove all personal files and applications, keep personal files but remove applications, or perform a full <b>factory</b> <b>reset.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ghost Push is {{a family}} of malware that infects the Android OS by {{automatically}} gaining root access, downloading malicious software, masquerading as a system app, and then losing root access, which then makes it virtually impossible to remove the infection even by <b>factory</b> <b>reset</b> unless the firmware is reflashed. The malware hogs all the system resources, making the phone unresponsive and draining the battery. Advertisements continually appear either as full or partial screen ads or in the status bar. Unwanted apps and malicious software are automatically downloaded and installed when connected to the internet. The malware is hard to detect.|$|E
50|$|Ghost Push: This {{is a kind}} of malware which infects the Android OS by {{automatically}} gaining root access, downloading malicious software, {{converting to}} a system app and then losing root access which makes it virtually impossible to remove the infection with a <b>factory</b> <b>reset</b> unless the firmware is reflashed. The malware hogs all system resources making it unresponsive and drains the battery. The advertisements appear anytime either in full screen, as part of a display, or in the status bar. The unnecessary apps automatically activate and sometimes download more malicious software when connected to the internet. It is hard to detect and remove. It steals the personal data of the user from the phone.|$|E
50|$|In July 2014, Avast {{released}} {{data about}} a study {{carried out on}} 20 used Android smartphones in regards to data security, during which it was discovered that Android's <b>factory</b> <b>reset</b> functionality did not delete all of the data from used phones; Avast found that it was able to retrieve 40,000 photos from used smartphones; news of this discovery made international headlines. Avast then created a product called Avast Anti-Theft, which is able to wipe and overwrite all data from a phone. That same month, Avast acquired a Czech-based mobile app company called Inmite, which has developed apps for mobile banking, mobile television, several applications for Google Glass, and a car-buying app for Škoda Auto.|$|E
50|$|The March 2016 update {{builds on}} the {{features}} that were introduced in the February 2016 update. New features that {{were included in the}} March 2016 update was the ability to purchase Xbox 360 compatible games on the Xbox One, party chat while broadcasting Twitch streams, customizable DVR recording lengths, which means that owners can now record a clip for up to 5 minutes long. Other improvements included the ability to track achievement progress from the Xbox One guide, video playback from the Xbox One activity feed, the ability to have 16 people in a party chat, the ability to track Xbox 360 achievements on the Xbox One activity feed. Further improvements in the March 2016 update include the ability to launch web links and YouTube videos directly from the Game Hubs and the ability for a user to compare their avatars to their friends. Additionally, the update also introduces the ability to <b>factory</b> <b>reset</b> the console without deleting installed games and applications.|$|E

40|$|With {{hundreds}} of millions of devices expected to be traded by 20181, flaws in smartphone sanitisation functions could be a serious problem. Trade press reports 2 have al-ready raised doubts about the effectiveness of Android “Fac-tory Reset”, but this paper presents the first comprehensive study of the issue. We study the implementation of <b>Factory</b> <b>Reset</b> on 21 Android smartphones from 5 vendors running Android versions v 2. 3. x to v 4. 3. We estimate that up to 500 million devices may not properly sanitise their data partition where credentials and other sensitive data are stored, and up to 630 M may not properly sanitise the internal SD card where multimedia files are generally saved. We found we could recover Google credentials on all devices presenting a flawed <b>Factory</b> <b>Reset.</b> Full-disk encryption has the potential to mitigate the problem, but we found that a flawed <b>Factory</b> <b>Reset</b> leaves behind enough data for the encryption key to be recovered. We discuss practical improvements for Google and vendors to mitigate these risks in the future. I...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{settings}} of the throttle that are remembered, {{even if the}} power switch is turned off and the batteries are removed. However, at any time, you may force the throttle back to its original factory settings, just as you received it. When the <b>FACTORY</b> <b>RESET</b> command is issued, all memory is erased and the defaults are reloaded. Step 1 : Push MENU twice. Step 2 : If you are sure you wish to restore the original factory settings, push the 7 key. When you push the 7 key, the AIRWIRE 900 splash screen appears followed by the normal home page. The frequency and address are now back to their original factory settings. The table below shows the complete set of <b>factory</b> <b>reset</b> values...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. All mobile phones use internal flash memory to store information. The flash memory contains personal user data {{that can be}} extracted {{with the use of}} forensics tools. This information could be used to profile a user's daily activity. However, all smartphones provide a tool to erase (<b>factory</b> <b>reset)</b> the information from the flash memory. Twenty-one smartphones were used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the factory-reset feature. A set of forensics tools from Cellebrite was used for the extraction and analysis process. The factory-reset feature was found to leave significant amounts of user-generated content after operation. The amount of user-generated content varied by vendor and model number. Extracted data are presented as evidence to show the ineffectiveness of the reset. User data such as photographs, audio files, text files, login information and geolocation data were left on the phone. The data analysis uncovered the unreliable nature of a <b>factory</b> <b>reset</b> and how the user is not properly protected. Outstanding ThesisCivilian, Department of the Nav...|$|E

40|$|The ActiveSync {{protocol}} 2 ̆ 7 s implementation on some {{embedded devices}} leaves clients vulnerable to unauthorised remote policy enforcement. This paper discusses a {{proof of concept}} attack against the implementation of ActiveSync in common Smart phones including Android devices and iOS devices. A two-phase approach to exploiting the ActiveSync protocol is introduced. Phase 1 details the usage of a man-in-the-middle attack to gain a vantage point over the client device, whilst Phase 2 involves spoofing the server-side ActiveSync responses to initiate the unauthorised policy enforcement. These vulnerabilities are demonstrated by experiment, highlighting how the system can be exploited to perform a remote <b>factory</b> <b>reset</b> upon an Exchange-integrated Smart phone...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} “anti-theft ” {{mechanisms}} available to con-sumers to thwart unauthorised access to personal data on stolen Android smartphones. With millions of devices stolen in the USA in 2013 alone, such attacks are {{a serious and}} growing problem. The main mitigation against unauthorised data access on stolen devices is provided by “anti-theft” apps; that is, with “remote wipe ” and “remote lock ” func-tions. We study the top 10 Mobile Anti-Virus (MAV) apps that implement these functions. They have been downloaded {{hundreds of millions of}} times. We investigate the general security practices of MAVs, as well as the implementation of their “remote wipe ” and “remote lock ” functions. Our analysis uncovers flaws that undermine MAV security claims and highlight the fragility of third-party security apps. We find that MAV remote locks may be unreliable due to poor implementation practices, Android API limitations and vendor customisations. Mobile OS architectures leave third-party security apps little leeway to improve built-in Factory Resets, therefore MAV remote wipe functions are not an alternative to a flawed built-in <b>Factory</b> <b>Reset.</b> We conclude the only viable solutions are those driven by vendors themselves.
