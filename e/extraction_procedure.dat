Besides, the male skeleton was not well preserved so the DNA <b>extraction</b> <b>procedure</b> may be very complicated. Even if the technology is fully functional, scientists still require DNA samples from a verified living descendant of Cao Cao to confirm the results.

The advantages of such procedures include decreased operator time, reduced solvent volumes, and increased extraction efficiency. The application of existing techniques, however, {{has not yet been}} applied to tissues that are widely available postmortem. Tissue analysis can make the task of interpretation of drug levels much easier, particularly where unstable drugs are involved (e. g., cocaine) 9 This review article explores the possibilities of applying existing <b>extraction</b> <b>procedures</b> to human tissue samples 9 We also consider the reasons why forensic laboratories have been slow to investigate such possibilities 9 We hope to stimulate interest in alternative tissue <b>extraction</b> <b>procedures</b> b...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{of drugs and}} metabolites in biological fluids usually requires <b>extraction</b> <b>procedures</b> to achieve sample clean-up and analyte preconcentration.

Most cases of surgical extraction procedures, require that, the forces are diverted, from the tooth, itself, to areas such as bone surrounding the tooth, to ensure adequate bone removal, before proceeding any further in the <b>extraction</b> <b>procedure.</b> Either way, the forces applied by various instruments during, both, simple, and complicated surgical procedure, may loosen the teeth present, both, in front of, or, behind the tooth, depending upon the impact direction and location of the force being applied and, that happening, only if the forces divert from the actual tooth that needs extraction. Such deleterious forces may weaken the anchorage of adjacent teeth from within their boney socket, and, hence, result in weakening of {{the adjacent}} teeth.|$|E

40|$|Background and objective: The {{advent of}} {{next-generation}} sequencing has significantly facilitated character-ization {{of the oral}} microbiome. Despite great efforts in streamlining the processes of sequencing and data curation, upstream steps required for amplicon library generation could still influence 16 S rRNA gene-based microbial profiles. Among upstream processes, DNA extraction is a critical step that could represent {{a great source of}} bias. Accounting for bias introduced by <b>extraction</b> <b>procedures</b> is important when comparing studies that use different methods. Identifying the method that best portrays communities is also desirable. Accordingly, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate bias introduced by different DNA <b>extraction</b> <b>procedures</b> on oral microbiome profiles. Design: Four DNA extraction methods were tested on mock communities consisting of seven representative oral bacteria. Additionally, supragingival plaque samples were collected from seven individuals and divided equally to test two commonly used DNA <b>extraction</b> <b>procedures.</b> Amplicon libraries of the 16 S rRNA gene were generated and sequenced via 454 -pyrosequencing. Results: Evaluation of mock communities revealed that DNA yield and bacterial species representation varied with DNA extraction methods. Despite producing the lowest yield of DNA, a method that included bead beating was the only protocol capable of detecting all seven species in the mock community. Comparison o...|$|R
40|$|Alternative <b>extraction</b> <b>procedures</b> {{based on}} a QuEChERS {{approach}} (Quick Easy Cheap Effective Rugged and Safe) were developed for the measurement of PAHs and PAH derivatives (nitrated, oxygenated and chlorinated-PAHs) associated to particulate matter from ambient air or combustion processes. The procedures are {{based on a}} short mechanical agitation (vortex) using a small volume of solvent (< 10 ml) and including, if necessary, a purification step by solid phase extraction (SPE) or dispersive-SPE (d-SPE). Different extraction parameters were optimized like agitation time, solvent nature, adsorbent for purification, etc. Equivalent extraction efficiencies were obtained when comparing the QuEChERS and the traditional pressurised solvent <b>extraction</b> <b>procedures</b> (PLE; ASE) for ambient air and emission (wood combustion) filter samples. QuEChERS extraction protocols were validated with the analysis of certified materials (NIST SRM 1649 a, urban dust or SRM 2787, fine urban particulate matter). Compared with solvent based extractions methods (including PLE), the QuEChERS <b>extraction</b> <b>procedures</b> allow to minimize experimental errors, to decrease significantly the extraction costs (by a 5 -fold factor) and to increase the productivity (10 times more samples proceeded per working day). No costly investment and system maintenance are required and, QuEChERS-like approaches seemed fully adapted to the analysis of many particle-bound organic compounds...|$|R
