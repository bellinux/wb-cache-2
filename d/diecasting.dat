40|$|The {{development}} and verification {{of a new}} version of the <b>DieCAST</b> ocean circulation model to be referred to as CANDIE (Canadian <b>Diecast)</b> are considered. Both CANDIE and <b>DieCAST</b> have many features in common with the well-known Modular Ocean Model (MOM) of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. Of particular relevance to the present study are the rigid-lid approximation and the use of standard Cartesian coordinates. The <b>DieCAST</b> formulation in terms of the surface pressure, rather than the volume transport streamfunction, is also used in CANDIE to reduce numerical sensitivity to ocean depth variations. The major difference between MOM and <b>DieCAST</b> is the use of a mixed C and A grid formulation in <b>DieCAST</b> rather than the B grid formulation used in MOM. CANDIE differs from <b>DieCAST</b> in the use of a standard C grid formulation and a reduction in the magnitude of the time truncation error associated with the implicit treatment of the Coriolis force. The implementation of the rigid-lid approximation is retained. To assess the reliability of both <b>DieCAST</b> and CANDIE, the authors have applied these models to a problem used by Haidvogel and Beckmann in a comparison of several different model formulations. The tests include the influence of a steep-sided coastal canyon that represents a significant challenge for the step topography of Cartesian coordinate models. Haidvogel and Beckmann’s tests show general agreement between models base...|$|R

50|$|Post-war, pressed tin and <b>diecast</b> zinc {{were the}} most popular {{materials}} used in Europe and Japan.

During the 1950s and 1960s, tin and pressed steel were seen broadly Japan, which dominantly used <b>diecast</b> into the 1970s.

50|$|RAMI {{models were}} made of <b>diecast</b> zamac metal alloy - only wheels and tires were plastic (Rixon 2005, p. 72). Some early models, like the Marne Taxi are made in <b>diecast</b> halves joining {{down the middle of}} the car - this faux pas was avoided on most other models. Seats and thin fenders were <b>diecast</b> metal on R.A.M.I. models, which is a bit rare as many <b>diecast</b> {{manufacturers}} of early brass era vehicles (like French Minialuxe) often use plastic. Plastic is easier to work with for 'spidery' parts such as wheel spokes, thin fenders, steering tillers, and long gearshift and brake levers (Sinclair 1979, p. 391). Occasionally, a dab of glue can be spied at the base of a lever or a tiller (Rixon 2005, p. 72). RAMI tops, even those purportedly of cloth were <b>diecast</b> in metal as well. Thus models were heavy, especially if one was used to handling plastic Minialuxe vehicles (Gibson 1971, 23).|$|R
