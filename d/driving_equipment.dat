The gearbox was an AMX 5-SD-200D, with five forward gears and five reverse gears. This transmission was heavily influenced by that of the German Panther tank and was based on a project which had begun in 1938. The transmission was one of the AMX-30's major faults and caused a variety of mechanical problems, including that the driver would have to manually change gears at specific times, even if the tank was moving over rough terrain.

40|$|QPA-CLIPS is an {{extension}} of CLIPS oriented towards process control applications. Its constructs define a dependency network of process actions driven by sensor information. The language consists of three basic constructs: TASK, SENSOR, and FILTER. TASK's define the dependency network describing alternative state transitions for a process. SENSOR's and FILTER's define sensor information sources used to activate state transitions within the network. Deftemplate's define these constructs and their run-time environment is an interpreter knowledge base, performing pattern matching on sensor information and so activating TASK's in the dependency network. The pattern matching technique is based on the repeatable occurrence of a sensor data pattern. QPA-CIPS has been successfully tested on a SPARCStation providing supervisory control to an Allen-Bradley PLC 5 controller <b>driving</b> molding <b>equipment...</b>|$|R
50|$|During the First World War, over 2,300 women served {{overseas}} in the Canadian Army Medical Corps.

50|$|In other instances, such as {{after an}} illness or injury, an {{assessment}} of the person's capacity for driving is required. No adaptive <b>driving</b> <b>equipment</b> may be needed; the focus is on identifying any changes in the person's sensory, motor, visual, perceptual, or cognitive ability. The clinical assessment is conducted first, followed by the on-road assessment, using a vehicle equipped with the passenger brake, mirror, and in some instances, an auxiliary steering wheel.|$|E
5000|$|In August 2002 Mr. Reyes {{purchased}} a 1967 Ferrari 330 GT {{which he could}} not drive as it has a manual transmission {{and he could not}} operate the necessary pedals with one leg.

50|$|The goal of driver {{rehabilitation}} is to aid {{individuals with}} disabilities or age-related impairments maintain independent driving and transportation. This maybe done {{through the use of}} specialized mobility equipment and training. The process begins with a clinical assessment of an individual's visual, visual-perceptual, cognitive, and physical skills that are necessary for driving. If the individual meets the criteria, an on-road assessment is conducted, in which the evaluator uses a vehicle equipped with adaptive <b>driving</b> <b>equipment,</b> as well as auxiliary brake and mirror on the passenger's side of the vehicle. Accommodations can be made via the use of mechanical or electronic steering, and acceleration and braking equipment, which are {{based on the results of}} the clinical assessment. If it is determined that the person has the potential to drive, training is offered to develop proficiency in using the mobility equipment. For novice drivers, driver's education is included in the services. Following training, a vehicle equipment prescription is provided, with a referral to a mobility equipment dealer for equipment installation. When the installation is completed, the vehicle is checked for proper fit, with additional training provided as needed.|$|E
50|$|Portable engines were {{in common}} use in industrialised {{countries}} {{from the early}} 19th through early 20th centuries, during an era when mechanical power transmission was widespread. Before that, most power generation and transmission were by animal, water, wind, or human; after that, a combination of electrification (including rural electrification) and modern vehicles and equipment (such as tractors, trucks, cars, engine-generators, and machines with their engines built in) displaced most use of portable engines. In developing countries today, portable engines still have some use (typically {{in the form of}} modern small engines mounted on boards), although the technologies mentioned above increasingly limit their demand there as well. In industrialised countries they are no longer used for commercial purposes, but preserved examples can often be seen at steam fairs <b>driving</b> appropriate <b>equipment</b> for demonstration purposes.|$|R
5000|$|Incidents of open {{hostility to}} tourers - {{such as being}} {{physically}} attacked or shot at, or having the vehicle deliberately rammed - were infrequent, but they did nevertheless happen occasionally. What was very common, however, was the tailing of crews by so-called [...] "narks" [...] - members of the East German State Security Service (Stasi). A combination of superior <b>equipment,</b> <b>driving</b> skills and the ever-increasing knowledge of the local terrain possessed by the BRIXMIS crews meant, however, that they could usually be shaken off.|$|R
5000|$|The {{partnership}} with GGRT extended in to 2011, with Self <b>driving</b> top-tier <b>equipment.</b> However, there were missteps, like a crash in Sonoma qualifying that relegated {{him to the}} back of the field. With a car that his crew chief described as [...] "winning", Self worked his way through the field using his car and crashed again, finishing 25th. He finished seventh in points with three top fives. [...] The following year, Self broke out, winning three races and only finishing out of the top ten six times in a fifteen race season. He improved to sixth in points. In 2013, Self won three races in a row and never fell out of the top six in points to finish fourth. Despite the six wins, Self did not return to the RCR driver development lineup in 2014. In 2017, Self returned in a part-time capacity for Sunrise Ford Racing.|$|R
50|$|In 1973, {{additional}} 54 Comeng power cars C3858 - 3911, and 56 Comeng trailer cars T4921 - 4962, {{were ordered}} {{to coincide with the}} opening of the Eastern suburbs railway line. These trailer cars were the first to be of stainless steel construction, and they had an extra row of seats on the top deck (and are thus distinguished by an extra single window at the centre of the car on both decks). Ten driving trailers D4011 - 4020 were built with small driver's compartments for 2-car trains. However, they never saw service as driving cars due to Union bans. Subsequently, 25 driving trailer cars D4021 - 4045 (with large guard's compartments) were also built to be paired with a driving motor car to allow 2-car sets to be operated. Ten driving trailers were diesel hauled on South Coast suburban services, south of Thirroul, prior to electrification. Ten driving trailers, renumbered D4001 - 4010, were used for two car shuttles in the initial period after the electrification of the Richmond line. These driving trailer cars subsequently had their <b>driving</b> <b>equipment</b> removed and were converted into standard non-driving trailer cars. Extended orders saw the Comeng double-deck fleet expanded to include power-cars C3912-3986 & 3741-3765, trailers T4963-4987 and driving trailers D4046-4095 by 1982. By 1976, one quarter of suburban cars were double deck. All the 1973 cars are now integrated with earlier stock and operate as L, R & S Sets. With the introduction of the Millennium Trains in 2002, several early Comeng power-cars were converted to non-driving trailers, with their pantographs removed, and renumbered T4701-4723.|$|E
5000|$|The {{production}} {{version of}} the AMX-30 was fitted with Hispano-Suiza's HS-110 diesel engine, located {{in the rear of}} the hull. The 28.8 L engine could be replaced on the field in 45 minutes, and produced , offering the tank a maximum velocity of 65 km/h on roads. The fuel efficient engine, in conjunction with a total fuel capacity of 970 L, gave the AMX-30 a maximum road range of up to 600 km. The engine's drive is taken through a Gravina G.H.B.200C twin-plate centrifugal clutch. The gearbox was an AMX 5-SD-200D, with five forward gears and five reverse gears. This transmission was heavily influenced by that of the German Panther tank and was based on a project which had begun in 1938. The transmission was one of the AMX-30's major faults and caused a variety of mechanical problems, including that the driver would have to manually change gears at specific times, even if the tank was moving over rough terrain. The tank's weight is distributed over five double, aluminum-alloy, rubber-tyred road wheels on either side, propelled on 570 mm wide tracks. The tank could ford 1.3 m deep water obstacles without preparation, up to 2 m with minor preparation, and up to 4 m with full preparation. Full preparation for water operations consisted of the addition of a snorkel tube, the installation of blanking plates, carried on the front of the hull, over the engine compartment's air intake louvers, and the installment of infra-red <b>driving</b> <b>equipment,</b> including a searchlight.
