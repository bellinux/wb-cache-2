Also, rational knowledge itself is described as being inadequate <b>for</b> <b>explaining</b> reality. Those who pursue only reason and science are ignorant. Even our progress is not progress {{as we continue to}} repeat the same errors as the past.|$|E

25|$|In {{an economy}} with money, the {{marginal}} utility of a quantity {{is simply that}} of the best good or service that it could purchase. In this way it is useful <b>for</b> <b>explaining</b> supply and demand, as well as essential aspects of models of imperfect competition.|$|E
25|$|The American Psychological Association's 1995 report Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns {{stated that}} IQ scores {{accounted}} <b>for</b> (<b>explained</b> variance) {{about a quarter}} of the social status variance and one-sixth of the income variance. Statistical controls for parental SES eliminate {{about a quarter of}} this predictive power. Psychometric intelligence appears as only one of a great many factors that influence social outcomes.|$|R

25|$|Some {{more recent}} models have {{incorporated}} quantum theory {{as a component}} of the underlying neural dynamics behind binding due to the strong explanatory power of quantum mechanics and their claim of the insufficiency of current models <b>for</b> <b>explaining</b> the complexity of the binding mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Thus place-names are {{important}} for showing the swift spread of English across England, and also provide important glimpses into details {{of the history of}} Brittonic and Latin in the region.

25|$|Unlike Lorentz and Thomson, Thomas Tommasina between 1903 and 1928 {{suggested}} long wavelength radiation {{to explain}} gravity, and short wavelength radiation <b>for</b> <b>explaining</b> the cohesive forces of matter. Charles F. Brush in 1911 also proposed long wavelength radiation. But he later revised his view and changed to extremely short wavelengths.|$|E

25|$|At the time, the {{electronic}} theory of molecular structure {{was in its}} formative years and was not considered as a vehicle by biologists <b>for</b> <b>explaining</b> phenomena, however Lacassagne saw promise in the prospect of Schmidt's hypothesis in attempting to explain carcinogenesis {{by a combination of}} elements of electron quantum theory, geometry and chemical structure.|$|E
25|$|In 1957 Illica’s widow {{died and}} his papers {{were given to}} the Parma Museum. Among them was the full {{libretto}} to La bohème.

25|$|Plume {{magmatism}} is {{an effective}} mechanism <b>for</b> <b>explaining</b> the large volumes of magmatism required to inflate an intrusion to several kilometres thickness (up to and greater than 13 kilometres).

Then, after some ceremonious compliments, he took his leave; and Aynsley laughed.|$|R
25|$|Energetics is {{important}} <b>for</b> <b>explaining</b> {{the evolution of}} foraging economic decisions in organisms; for example, {{a study of the}} African honey bee, A. m. scutellata, has shown that honey bees may trade-off the high sucrose content of viscous nectar for the energetic benefits of warmer, less concentrated nectar, which also reduces their consumption and flight time.|$|E
25|$|Historians of European {{witchcraft}} {{have found}} the anthropological definition difficult to apply to European and British witchcraft, where witches could equally use (or be accused of using) physical techniques, {{as well as some}} who really had attempted to cause harm by thought alone. European witchcraft is seen by historians and anthropologists as an ideology <b>for</b> <b>explaining</b> misfortune; however, this ideology has manifested in diverse ways, as described below.|$|E
25|$|It {{has long}} been known that a kind of anemia, termed thalassemia, has a high {{frequency}} in some Mediterranean populations, including Greeks and southern Italians. The name is derived from the Greek words for sea (thalassa), meaning the Mediterranean sea, and blood (haima). Vernon Ingram deserves the credit <b>for</b> <b>explaining</b> the genetic basis of different forms of thalassemia as an imbalance in the synthesis of the two polypeptide chains of hemoglobin.|$|E

25|$|Prices and {{quantities}} {{have been}} described as the most directly observable attributes of goods produced and exchanged in a market economy. The theory of supply and demand is an organizing principle <b>for</b> <b>explaining</b> how prices coordinate the amounts produced and consumed. In microeconomics, it applies to price and output determination for a market with perfect competition, which includes the condition of no buyers or sellers large enough to have price-setting power.|$|E
25|$|Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory {{is another}} {{cognitive}} process theory that offers the important concept of self-efficacy <b>for</b> <b>explaining</b> employee's level of motivation relative to workplace tasks or goals. Self-efficacy is an individual's belief {{in his or}} her ability to achieve results in a given scenario. Empirically, studies have shown a strong correlation between self-efficacy and performance. The concept has been extended to group efficacy, which is a group's belief that it can achieve success with a given task or project.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{algorithm}} {{is also used}} to define the notion of decidability. That notion is central <b>for</b> <b>explaining</b> how formal systems come into being starting from a small set of axioms and rules. In logic, the time that an algorithm requires to complete cannot be measured, as it is not apparently related with our customary physical dimension. From such uncertainties, that characterize ongoing work, stems the unavailability of a definition of algorithm that suits both concrete (in some sense) and abstract usage of the term.|$|E
