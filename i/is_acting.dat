5|$|Pouring mercury onto a {{horizontal}} flat sheet of glass {{results in a}} puddle that has a perceptible thickness. The puddle will spread out only {{to the point where}} it is a little under half a centimetre thick, and no thinner. Again this is due to the action of mercury's strong surface tension.

The result of the compromise is a puddle of a nearly fixed thickness.|$|E
