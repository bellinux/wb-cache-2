30|$|In addition, the {{reaction}} of the HV:HF system with clays forms a thin aluminum silicate phosphonate coating on the clay. This coating, in return, prevents further spending of the HF acid and reduces {{the reaction}} rate on high surface area clays. As a consequence, the volume of silica material that can be dissolved is increased, causing further improvement to the near-wellbore permeability (Obadare et al. 2006). The production of ammonium phosphonate salt, while HF is evolved from the HV acid, eliminates the generation of insoluble precipitates as the pH of the spent acid system rises. This is a common problem with conventional HF acid systems. Furthermore, the rock substrate is conditioned to be water wet with this HV:HF chemistry. Water-wet condition improves the acid contact with the targeted alumino-silicate material. Precipitation of <b>fluorosilicates,</b> hexafluorosilicates, alumino-fluorosilicates, iron compounds and calcium fluoride, commonly generated during acidizing with conventional HF are prevented {{as a consequence of the}} strong chelating property of the HV:HF acid system (Nwoke et al., 2004).

40|$|For {{the first}} time, several {{silicate}} glass property databases were analyzed without using any a priori {{knowledge of the}} details of bonding and lumped as a single group, {{as a function of the}} chemical composition. The viscosity of over 300 compositions including soda-lime glasses, borosilicates, glasses with high alkaline earth content, NIST glass viscosity standards, lead silicates, <b>fluorosilicates,</b> and phospho-silicates have been examined. Using multiple regression modeling, linear and multiplicative relations between the chemical composition and several properties, e. g. viscosity, thermal expansion, density, refractive index, electrical conductivity were developed.

40|$|An {{effective}} method using hydrofluoric and sulfuric acid was proposed {{to enhance the}} leaching of lithium from α-spodumene, without calcination that is subjected to 1000 °C for phase transformation. The thermodynamic feasibility of the reactions was firstly verified. Dissolution conditions were tested to maximize the leaching efficiency of lithium and with efficient utilization of hydrofluoric acid (HF) served as evaluation criteria. The results showed that 96 % of lithium could be transferred into lixivium with an ore/HF/H 2 SO 4 ratio of 1 : 3 : 2 (g/mL/mL), at 100 °C for 3 h. Due {{to the fact that}} HF molecules were the main reaction form, the dissolution behaviors were theoretically represented and investigated by dissolution in HF/H 2 SO 4. When combined with chemical elements analyses and characterizations, the results of the dissolution behaviors revealed that α-spodumene and albite were preferentially dissolved over quartz. Insoluble fluoroaluminates, such as AlF 3, cryolite (Na 3 AlF 6) and cryolithionite (Na 3 Li 3 Al 2 F 12), were generated and might be further partially dissolved by H 2 SO 4. <b>Fluorosilicates,</b> such as K 2 SiF 6, Na 2 SiF 6, or KNaSiF 6, were also generated {{as a part of the}} insoluble residues.

40|$|Sandstone {{acidizing}} {{has been}} carried out with mud acid which combines hydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric acid at various ratios. The application of mud acid in sandstone formations has presented quite a large number of difficulties like corrosion, precipitation of reaction products, matrix deconsolidation, decomposition of clays by HCl, and fast spending of the acids. There has been a recent trend to use chelating agents for stimulation in place of mud acid which are used in oil industry widely for iron control operations. In this study, two chelates, L-glutamic-N, N-diacetic acid (GLDA) and hydroxyethylethylene-diaminetriacetic acid (HEDTA) have been studied as an alternative to mud acid for acidizing. In order to analyze their performance in the application of acidizing, coreflood tests were performed on Berea and Bandera sandstone cores. Another disadvantage of mud acid has been the fast spending at clay mineral surfaces leading to depletion of acid strength, migration of fines, and formation of colloidal silica gel residue. Hence, compatibility of chelates with clay minerals was investigated through the static solubility tests. GLDA and HEDTA were analyzed for their permeability enhancement properties in Berea and Bandera cores. In the coreflood experiments conducted, it was found out that chelating agents can successfully stimulate sandstone formations. The final permeability of the Berea and Bandera cores were enhanced significantly. GLDA performed better than HEDTA in all applications. The substitution of seawater in place of deionized water for mixing purposes also led to an increased conductivity of the core implying GLDA is compatible with seawater. In the static solubility tests, chelates were mixed with HF acid at various concentrations. GLDA fluids kept more amounts of minerals in the solution when compared with HEDTA fluids. Sodium-based chelates when mixed with HF acid showed inhibited performance due to the formation of sodium <b>fluorosilicates</b> precipitates which are insoluble damage creating compounds. The application of ammonium-based chelate with HF acid was able to bring a large amount of aluminosilciates into the solution.
