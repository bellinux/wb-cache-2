5|$|Diplodocids like Apatosaurus {{are often}} portrayed with their necks held <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the air, {{allowing}} them to browse on tall trees. Some studies state diplodocid necks were less flexible than previously believed, because {{the structure of the}} neck vertebrae would not have allowed the neck to bend far upwards, and that sauropods like Apatosaurus were adapted to low browsing or ground feeding.|$|E

While this seems in some way demeaning to Napoleon's figure (and {{contrasts}} in the extreme with David's version, which shows Napoleon impervious to the cold, and in a heroic light), Delaroche's artwork was not intended to portray him in a hostile or unbecoming way. Delaroche wanted to depict Napoleon as a credible man, who suffered and underwent human hardship too, on his most daring exploits, and felt that making him appear as he really {{would have been in the}} situation would by no means debase or diminish Napoleon's iconic status or legacy, but rather make him a more admirable person.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} in 1987 of a primitive tomb at Mondeval de Sora <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> {{the mountains to}} the south of Cortina testifies to the presence of Mesolithic man in the area {{as far back as the}} 6th millennium B.C. In the 6th century B.C., Etruscan writing was introduced in the province of Cadore, in whose possession is remained until the early 15th century. From the 3rd century B.C., the Romans assimilated the Veneti people, giving the area the name of Amplitium (from amplus meaning wide), today's Ampezzo.|$|E
5|$|Later, diplodocids {{were often}} portrayed with their necks held <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the air, {{allowing}} them to graze from tall trees. Studies using computer models have shown that neutral posture of the neck was horizontal, rather than vertical, and scientists such as Kent Stephens have used this to argue that sauropods including Diplodocus did not raise their heads much above shoulder level. A nuchal ligament may have held the neck in this position. A 2009 study found that all tetrapods appear to hold their necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture, and argued that the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from other animals. One of the sauropod models {{in this study was}} Diplodocus, which they found would have held its neck at about a 45° angle with the head pointed downwards in a resting posture.|$|E

5|$|Magpies {{have a long}} {{breeding}} season which varies {{in different parts of}} the country; in northern parts of Australia they will breed between June and September, but not commence until August or September in cooler regions, and may continue until January in some alpine areas. The nest is a bowl-shaped structure made of sticks and lined with softer material such as grass and bark. Near human habitation, synthetic material may be incorporated. Nests are built exclusively by females and generally placed <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a tree fork, often in an exposed position. The trees used are most commonly eucalypts, although a variety of other native trees as well as introduced pine, Crataegus, and elm have been recorded. Other bird species, such as the yellow-rumped thornbill (Acanthiza chrysorrhoa), willie wagtail (Rhipidura leucophrys), southern whiteface (Aphelocephala leucopsis), and (less commonly) noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala), often nest in the same tree as the magpie. The first two species may even locate their nest directly beneath a magpie nest, while the diminutive striated pardalote (Pardalotus striatus) has been known to make a burrow for breeding into the base of the magpie nest itself. These incursions are all tolerated by the magpies. The channel-billed cuckoo (Scythrops novaehollandiae) is a notable brood parasite in eastern Australia; magpies will raise cuckoo young, which eventually outcompete the magpie nestlings.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{service was}} operated by trains composed of an engine and three carriages. Thirty-two passengers could be accommodated in each carriage, which had longitudinal bench seating and sliding {{doors at the}} ends, leading onto a platform for boarding and alighting. It was reasoned {{that there was nothing}} to look at in the tunnels, so the only windows were in a narrow band <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the carriage sides. Gate-men rode on the carriage platforms to operate the lattice gates and announce the station names to the passengers. Because of their claustrophobic interiors, the carriages soon became known as padded cells. Unlike other railways, the C had no ticket classes or paper tickets; when the railway began operations, a flat fare of two pence, collected at a turnstile, was charged. Despite the cramped carriages and competition from bus and tram services, the railway attracted 5.1million passengers in 1891, its first year of operation. To alleviate overcrowding, the fleet of rolling stock was enlarged.|$|E

25|$|The {{distribution}} and stylistic range of these paintings is quite distinctive, and {{contrasts with the}} Wandjina tradition.

The art is primarily painted where a suitable rock shelter is found; in contrast with Wandjina art, which has a limited distribution restricted to isolated sites. Unlike Wandjina, Bradshaw art is rarely found on ceilings, rather vertical rock surfaces are used, <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> escarpments in shallower rock shelters with small overhangs and with irregular rocky floors not suitable for occupation.|$|E

25|$|Reed's first {{investigation}} is the Magdalena Cartel, {{believed to be}} responsible for 75% of New York's cocaine trade. Higgins had made contact with socialite and philanthropist Teresa Castillo (Socorro Santiago), who he believed may be able to help him get inside the cartel. She gives Reed information leading him to the Magdalena safe house, where he chases down their leader, Rey (Paolo Andino). However, Rey turns out to be head of the Latin Lords, the main rival of the Magdalena Cartel; the Cartel was using Reed to take out their competition. Reed discovers Teresa's real name is Magdalena Rojas, and she runs the cartel. He arrests her, but she tells him she doesn't know who the mole is, only that as their information was always accurate, she knows it is someone <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the OCU.|$|E
25|$|Clearing is {{when the}} player in {{possession}} of the ball is pressed hard, often near his own goal, and chooses to shoot the ball away with low precision simply {{in order to get}} out of a dangerous situation. When opponent pressure is extremely high, the ball is often cleared to a corner kick or to a throw-in. Clearing long, but into opponent control, may give the defence time and the opportunity to organise, including setting up the correct formation and pressure height. If the attack was high up the field, such as in or near the penalty area, defenders will thus quickly push out, and attackers will then be forced to retreat in order to avoid offside in the next move. Clearing may be combined with an attempt to hit a long pass or a long through ball. Players <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the field who are pressed hard, and who are eager to avoid a counter-attack, may in some instances combine clearing with a shot.|$|E
