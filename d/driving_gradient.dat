Water vapour transmission is a multi-stage process, consisting of penetrant absorption, solubility, desorption and diffusion.

In laminated leather and its layers water vapour absorption may be classified as non-Fickian: sigmoidal – for microporous film and two-stage – for all leather samples. Water vapour accumulation at the leather/adhesive layer interface causes the adhesion loss of coating polyurethane film {{and changes in the}} failure mode. Water vapour induced film delamination begins at the weakened sites of the interface (i. e. small cavities, voids, and topographical irregularities of leather, etc.).

The inhibition was antagonized by 5 mmol L- 1 mercaptoethanol. By comparison, 10 mmol L- 1 mucosal tetraethylammonium, an inhibitor of certain aquaporins, inhibited Jv by 20 %. In the presence of glucose, mucosal addition of phloridzin inhibited water transport by 20 %, suggesting that water transport is partially linked to the Na+-glucose cotransporter.

40|$|Physical-chemical {{treatment}} of liquid wastes is becoming widespread. One promising physical treatment process is contaminant adsorption on activated carbon. Units are frequently operated with {{the inclusion of}} carbon reactivation or' regeneration. In order to design adsorption processes both the kinetics of removal {{and the effects of}} regeneration require quantification. This study was conducted to establish the kinetics of phenol removal in non-flow, well-mixed reactors where cocoanut charcoal was the adsorbent. The batch system consisted of a Phipps-Bird six place paddle stirrer run at 162 RPM. Reactor volumes were 1000 ml and fluid volumes were 900 ml. Reactors were buffered to pH of 6. 8 to 7. 0. Phenol was measured by light absorbance on a Beckman DBG spectrophotometer. Removal rate was found to follow a film diffusion limitation description, where concentration gradient across the proposed film was the driving force. Effective concentration at the surface of the particle was calculated by applying the isotherm equation of Weber and Morris, for which the parameters were established for the system studied. The proportionality between <b>driving</b> <b>gradient</b> and removal rate was determined. When the ratio of phenol to carbon was in excess of approximately 40 mg/gm intraparticle diffusion limitation was indicated. Regeneration effects on carbon were studied in four phases. The first phase established, for a single high temperature regeneration of carbon, initially loaded to 1 % by weight, that uptake rate was decreased upon redose, relative to virgin carbon. The second phase showed that virgin carbon at equilibrium with the atmosphere underwent mass loss and eventual destruction at regeneration temperatures of 550 °C and 950 °C, whereas, at 170 °C, mass loss stabilized at 3 %. The third phase separated, partially, the mechanisms operative in capacity change during regeneration at a single temperature (550 °C). The final phase of the regeneration study established, for the temperatures and loadings studied, the desirability of high temperature of regeneration and heavy loading of the carbon prior to regeneration. More capacity was recovered, and carbon destruction was retarded, when the carbon was initially heavily loaded and the regeneration temperature was the highest studied...|$|E
40|$|The Maximum Entropy Production (MEP) {{principle}} is a conjecture assuming that a medium is organized {{in such a}} way that maximum power is subtracted from a gradient driving a flux (with power being a flux times its <b>driving</b> <b>gradient).</b> This maximum power is also known as the Carnot limit. It has already been shown that the atmosphere operates close to this Carnot limit when it comes to heat transport from the Equator to the poles, or vertically, from the surface to the atmospheric boundary layer. To reach this state close to the Carnot limit, the effective thermal conductivity of the atmosphere is adapted by the creation of convection cells (e. g. wind). The aim of this study is to test if the soil’s effective hydraulic conductivity also adapts itself {{in such a way}} that it operates close to the Carnot limit. The big difference between atmosphere and soil is the way of adaptation of its resistance. The soil’s hydraulic conductivity is either changed by weathering processes, which is a very slow process, or by creation of preferential flow paths. In this study the latter process is simulated in a lab experiment, where we focus on the preferential flow paths created by piping. Piping is the process of backwards erosion of sand particles subject to a large pressure gradient. Since this is a relatively fast process, it is suitable for being tested in the lab. In the lab setup a horizontal sand bed connects two reservoirs that both drain freely at a level high enough to keep the sand bed always saturated. By adding water to only one reservoir, a horizontal pressure gradient is maintained. If the flow resistance is small, a large gradient develops, leading to the effect of piping. When pipes are being formed, the effective flow resistance decreases; the flow through the sand bed increases and the pressure gradient decreases. At a certain point, the flow velocity is small enough to stop the pipes from growing any further. In this steady state, the effective flow resistance of the sand bed will be compared with the theoretical optimal flow resistance obtained with the MEP principle. For this study, different magnitudes of the forcing will be tested, while also the effect of dry spells will be explored...|$|E
40|$|This {{work is a}} {{theoretical}} contribution {{to the study of}} thermo-hydrodynamic instabilities in fluids submitted to surface-tension (Marangoni) and buoyancy (Rayleigh) effects in layered (Benard) configurations. The driving constraint consists in a thermal (or a concentrational) gradient orthogonal to the plane of the layer(s). Linear, weakly nonlinear as well as strongly nonlinear analyses are carried out, with emphasis on high Prandtl (or Schmidt) number fluids, although some results are also given for low-Prandtl number liquid metals. Attention is mostly devoted to the mechanisms responsible for the onset of complex spatio-temporal behaviours in these systems, {{as well as to the}} theoretical explanation of some existing experimental results. As far as linear stability analyses (of the diffusive reference state) are concerned, a number of different effects are studied, such as Benard convection in two layers coupled at an interface (for which a general classification of instability modes is proposed), surface deformation effects and phase-change effects (non-equilibrium evaporation). Moreover, a number of different monotonous and oscillatory instability modes (leading respectively to patterns and waves in the nonlinear regime) are identified. In the case of oscillatory modes in a liquid layer with deformable interface heated from above, our analysis generalises and clarifies earlier works on the subject. A new Rayleigh-Marangoni oscillatory mode is also described for a liquid layer with an undeformable interface heated from above (coupling between internal and surface waves). Weakly nonlinear analyses are then presented, first for monotonous modes in a 3 D system. Emphasis is placed on the derivation of amplitude (Ginzburg-Landau) equations, with universal structure determined by the general symmetry properties of the physical system considered. These equations are thus valid outside the context of hydrodynamic instabilities, although they generally depend on a certain number of numerical coefficients which are calculated for the specific convective systems studied. The nonlinear competitions of patterns such as convective rolls, hexagons and squares is studied, showing the preference for hexagons with upflow at the centre in the surface-tension-driven case (and moderate Prandtl number), and of rolls in the buoyancy-induced case. A transition to square patterns recently observed in experiments is also explained by amplitude equation analysis. The role of several fluid properties and of heat transfer conditions at the free interface is examined, for one-layer and two-layer systems. We also analyse modulation effects (spatial variation of the envelope of the patterns) in hexagonal patterns, leading to the description of secondary instabilities of supercritical hexagons (Busse balloon) in terms of phase diffusion equations, and of pentagon-heptagon defects in the hexagonal structures. In the frame of a general non-variational system of amplitude equations, we show that the pentagon-heptagon defects are generally not motionless, and may even lead to complex spatio-temporal dynamics (via a process of multiplication of defects in hexagonal structures). The onset of waves is also studied in weakly nonlinear 2 D situations. The competition between travelling and standing waves is first analysed in a two-layer Rayleigh-Benard system (competition between thermal and mechanical coupling of the layers), in the vicinity of special values of the parameters for which a multiple (Takens-Bogdanov) bifurcation occurs. The behaviours in the vicinity of this point are numerically explored. Then, the interaction between waves and steady patterns with different wavenumbers is analysed. Spatially quasiperiodic (mixed) states are found to be stable in some range when the interaction between waves and patterns is non-resonant, while several transitions to chaotic dynamics (among which an infinite sequence of homoclinic bifurcations) occur when it is resonant. Some of these results have quite general validity, because they are shown to be entirely determined by quadratic interactions in amplitude equations. Finally, models of strongly nonlinear surface-tension-driven convection are derived and analysed, which are thought to be representative of the transitions to thermal turbulence occurring at very high <b>driving</b> <b>gradient.</b> The role of the fastest growing modes (intrinsic length scale) is discussed, as well as scalings of steady regimes and their secondary instabilities (due to instability of the thermal boundary layer), leading to chaotic spatio-temporal dynamics whose preliminary analysis (energy spectrum) reveals features characteristic of hydrodynamic turbulence.

40|$|According to Dooge (1986) intermediate-scale {{catchments}} are {{systems of}} organized complexity, being too organized and yet {{too small to}} be characterized on a statistical/ conceptual basis, but too large and too heterogeneous to be characterized in a deterministic manner. A key requirement for building structurally adequate models precisely for this intermediate scale is {{a better understanding of how}} different forms of spatial organization affect storage and release of water and energy. Here, we propose that a combination of the concept of hydrological response units (HRUs) and thermodynamics offers several helpful and partly novel perspectives for gaining this improved understanding. Our key idea is to define functional similarity based on similarity of the terrestrial controls of gradients and resistance terms controlling the land surface energy balance, rainfall runoff transformation, and groundwater storage and release. This might imply that functional similarity with respect to these specific forms of water release emerges at different scales, namely the small field scale, the hillslope, and the catchment scale. We thus propose three different types of “functional units” – specialized HRUs, so to speak – which behave similarly with respect to one specific form of water release and with a characteristic extent equal to one of those three scale levels. We furthermore discuss an experimental strategy based on exemplary learning and replicate experiments to identify and delineate these functional units, and as a promising strategy for characterizing the interplay and organization of water and energy fluxes across scales. We believe the thermodynamic perspective to be well suited to unmask equifinality as inherent in the equations governing water, momentum, and energy fluxes: this is because several combinations of gradients and resistance terms yield the same mass or energy flux and the terrestrial controls of gradients and resistance terms are largely independent. We propose that structurally adequate models at this scale should consequently disentangle <b>driving</b> <b>gradients</b> and resistance terms, because this optionally equifinality to be partly reduced by including available observations, e. g., on <b>driving</b> <b>gradients.</b> Most importantly, the thermodynamic perspective yields an energy-centered perspective on rainfall-runoff transformation and evapotranspiration, including fundamental limits for energy fluxes associated with these processes. This might additionally reduce equifinality and opens up opportunities for testing thermodynamic optimality principles within independent predictions of rainfall-runoff or land surface energy exchange. This is pivotal to finding out whether or not spatial organization in catchments is in accordance with a fundamental organizing principle...|$|R

50|$|The <b>gradient</b> <b>driving</b> the {{diffusion}} is then {{the difference between}} the large excess minority carrier densities at the barrier and the low densities in the bulk, and that gradient drives diffusion of minority carriers from the interface into the bulk. The injected minority carriers are reduced in number as they travel into the bulk by recombination mechanisms that drive the excess concentrations toward the bulk values.|$|R

The lipid bilayer is {{represented as a}} capacitance (Cm). Voltage-gated and leak ion channels are represented by nonlinear (gn) and linear (gL) conductances, respectively. The electrochemical <b>gradients</b> <b>driving</b> the flow of ions are represented by batteries (E), and ion pumps and exchangers are represented by current sources (Ip).|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} hybrid-lattice Boltzmann (LB) {{algorithm}} for calculating {{the flow of}} glass-forming fluids that are governed by integral constitutive equations with pronounced nonlinear, non-Markovian dependence of the stresses on the flow history. The LB simulation for the macroscopic flow fields is combined with the mode-coupling theory of the glass transition (MCT) as a microscopic theory, {{in the framework of}} the integration-through transients (ITT) formalism. Using the combined LB-MCT algorithm, pressure-driven planar channel flow is studied for a schematic MCT model neglecting spatial correlations in the microscopic dynamics. The cessation dynamics after removal of the <b>driving</b> pressure <b>gradient</b> shows strong signatures of oscillatory flow both in the macroscopic fields and the microscopic correlation functions...|$|R
40|$|Proper {{assembly}} {{and function of}} cytochrome c oxidase, which catalyzes the reduction of O 2 and generates the proton <b>gradient</b> <b>driving</b> ATP synthesis, depend on correct copper delivery and incorporation. Structural details about the protein-protein complexes involved in this process are still missing. We describe here models of four complexes along this pathway obtained by combining bioinformatics interface predictions with information-driven docking and discuss their relevance with respect to known and pathogenic mutations...|$|R
