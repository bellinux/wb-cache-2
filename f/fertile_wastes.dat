The latter, famed for its malmsey, has lost its vines and kept its name. The cultivation extended some 1,500 feet above the sea, and the plant was treated after the fashion of Madeira and Carniola (S. Austria). The latadas, or trellises, varied in height, some being so low that the peasant had to creep under them. All, however, had the same defect: the fruit got the shade and the leaves the sun, unless trimmed away by the cultivator, who was unwilling to remove these lungs in too great quantities. The French style, the pruned plant supported by a stake, was used only for the old and worn-out, and none dreamt of the galvanised wires along which Mr. Leacock, of Funchal, trains his vines. In Grand Canary I have seen the grape-plant thrown over swathes of black stone, like those which, bare of fruit, stretch for miles across the <b>fertile</b> <b>wastes</b> of the Syrian Haurán. By heat and evaporation the grapes become raisins; and, as in Dalmatia, one pipe required as much fruit as sufficed {{for three or four}} of ordinary.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the uptake of D-galacturonic acid into the yeast cell and the genetic engineering of a yeast strain containing the fungal genes for D-galacturonic acid catabolism. Bioethanol {{is considered a}} more sustainable alternative for transport fuels derived from fossil reserves. However, as it is produced nowadays, bioethanol is criticised because of its use of valuable food crops and <b>fertile</b> agricultural lands. <b>Waste</b> products from agriculture (e. g. corn stover, wheat straw, bagasse, beet pulp), paper industry, forestry and the cultivation of bioenergy crops, i. e. fast-growing trees or grasses {{have the potential to}} overcome this problem. Unfortunately, these feedstocks, named lignocellulose substrates, are difficult to convert into bioethanol in a commercially-viable way. The hydrolysis of lignocellulose substrates into monomeric or dimeric sugars, as well as the fermentation of the sugars by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are troublesome. S. cerevisiae can ferment only a certain range of sugars. Therefore, many efforts have been devoted to the genetic engineering of yeast in order to obtain strains that can ferment xylose and arabinose, the most important non-fermentable sugars in most lignocellulosic hydrolysates. The goal of this project was to explore the use of pectin-rich substrates for bioethanol production. This is an attractive alternative for the common lignocellulose feedstocks because none of the problems concerning hydrolysis or use of food crops and agricultural lands apply. Besides pectin-rich waste streams like sugar beet pulp and citrus pulp, we are particularly interested in the pectin-rich cactus Opuntia ficus-indica. This cactus has an established high productivity in large-scale plantations in semi-arid areas. The main problem here is that pectin is to a large extent composed of the sugar D-galacturonic acid, which cannot be fermented by yeast. In this study, we have tackled this issue by focussing on the uptake and the metabolisation of D-galacturonic acid by S. cerevisiae. While the uptake of D-galacturonic acid is well established in bacteria, there are no studies on D-galacturonic acid uptake in S. cerevisiae. In contrast to what has been suggested in the literature, we have shown that S. cerevisiae transports D-galacturonic acid at an unexpectedly high rate given its inability to metabolize this compound as a substrate. The uptake of D-galacturonic acid was strongly enhanced at low pH. The D-galacturonic acid uptake easily matches or even exceeds the uptake of non-metabolized compounds like arabinose or xylose in S. cerevisiae, especially at an extracellular pH of 4. 5  5, which is typical for bioethanol fermentations. Moreover, the uptake is not inhibited by any other sugar present in lignocellulose hydrolysates, which is an important advantage. The D-galacturonic acid uptake was subsequently further characterized. Despite the strong increase of the uptake at low pH, there is only modest inhibition by proton gradient uncouplers and no intracellular accumulation above the extracellular levels, which suggests that the uptake does not occur by H+-symport. Probably the strong pH effect is due to a preference of the uptake system for the undissociated D-galacturonic acid. pHi measurements show that the buffering capacity of the cytosol is high enough to fully counteract the dissociation of D-galacturonic acid inside the cell and supports our hypothesis. There was no saturation of the uptake rate at higher substrate concentrations, which prevented determination of a Km-value for the uptake. Because of the diffusion-like characteristics of the uptake and the hydrophilic nature of D-galacturonic acid, a channel-type uptake system appears to be most likely. In spite of many efforts, we were unable to identify the gene or genes that encode the transport system. None of the plasma membrane channel deletion strains, nor any of the other plasma membrane transporter single and multiple deletion strains tested, were deficient or even partially affected in D-galacturonic acid uptake. Several explanations are possible. The D-galacturonic acid transporter does not belong to the list of 200 genes that were examined or the transport system is encoded by multiple genes. The second part of this work was devoted to the construction of a laboratory yeast strain expressing the D-galacturonic acid degradation pathway from the fungus Trichoderma reesei. Four fungal genes were expressed from plasmids and the enzymatic activity was confirmed in the recombinant S. cerevisiae strain. Since the strain did not spontaneously grow on D-galacturonic acid, spontaneous mutants were selected after prolonged incubation in D-galacturonic acid medium and glycerol, which was added as source of reducing power. The first tests with these mutants were very promising, as we saw a clear improvement of the growth only when D-galacturonic and glycerol were present together in the medium. Unfortunately, the phenotype in two of the three mutants was found to be independent of the plasmids that we introduced. Futher analysis showed an enhanced glycerol consumption, but no D-galacturonic acid utilization. Hence, the mutants must have acquired a mutation that enhances the growth on glycerol. Surprisingly, D-galacturonic acid and - as we found later - also other organic acids like D-glucuronic acid and malic acid seem to stimulate the glycerol growth. It remains puzzling why the phenotype was plasmid dependent in one of the mutants. Microarray analysis and realtime PCR have shown that the mutants have an increased expression of the glycerol/H+-symporter STL 1, probably due to multiplication of an 18 kb-large subtelomeric region containing the STL 1 gene. Moreover, STL 1 expression and improved glycerol growth were correlated in segregants of a diploid of one of the mutants crossed with the parent. Our results indicate that Stl 1 is important for the growth on glycerol, especially at low glycerol concentration. However, mere overexpression of STL 1 was insufficient to restore the phenotype, which suggests additional mutations in the mutants. Finally, our results provide an important contribution to the development of genetically engineered yeast strains able to convert pectin hydrolysates into bioethanol, since they show that introduction of a heterologous D-galacturonic acid transporter may not be required. To obtain a D-galacturonic acid fermenting yeast strain, future investigations {{will have to deal with}} several challenges like the cofactor recycling and the metabolism of glycerol, an intermediate in the D-galacturonic acid pathway that is difficult to convert to ethanol in S. cerevisiae. Finally, interesting findings were obtained regarding the growth of yeast in glycerol medium, with possible applications in yeast production from glycerol, which is nowadays quite cheaply available as a by-product from biodiesel production.
