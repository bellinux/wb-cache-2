5|$|Insectivorous insects, or {{insects that}} <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> other insects, are {{beneficial}} to humans if they eat insects {{that could cause}} damage to agriculture and human structures. For example, aphids <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> crops and cause problems for farmers, but ladybugs <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> aphids, {{and can be used}} as a means to get significantly reduce pest aphid populations. While birds are perhaps more visible predators of insects, insects themselves account for the vast majority of insect consumption. Ants also help control animal populations by consuming small vertebrates. Without predators to keep them in check, insects can undergo almost unstoppable population explosions.|$|E
5|$|Tooth shape {{depends on}} the shark's diet: those that <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> mollusks and {{crustaceans}} have dense and flattened teeth used for crushing, those that <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> fish have needle-like teeth for gripping, and those that <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> larger prey such as mammals have pointed lower teeth for gripping and triangular upper teeth with serrated edges for cutting. The teeth of plankton-feeders such as the basking shark are small and non-functional.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, the DNA {{differences}} between head lice and body lice provide corroborating evidence that humans used clothing between 80,000 and 170,000 years ago, before leaving Africa. Human head and body lice occupy distinct ecological zones: head lice live and <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> the scalp, while body lice live on clothing and <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> the body. Because body lice require clothing to survive, the divergence of head and body lice from their common ancestor provides {{an estimate of}} the date of introduction of clothing in human evolutionary history.|$|E
5|$|Beetles can be {{beneficial}} to human economics by controlling the populations of pests. The larvae and adults of some species of lady beetles (Coccinellidae) <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> aphids that are pests. Other lady beetles <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> scale insects, whitefly and mealybugs. If normal food sources are scarce, they may <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> small caterpillars, young plant bugs, or honeydew and nectar. Ground beetles (Carabidae) are common predators of many insect pests, including fly eggs, caterpillars, and wireworms. Ground beetles can help to control weeds by eating their seeds in the soil, reducing the need for herbicides to protect crops. The effectiveness of some species in reducing certain plant populations {{has resulted in the}} deliberate introduction of beetles in order to control weeds. For example, the genus Zygogramma is native to North America but has been used to control Parthenium hysterophorus in India and Ambrosia artemisiifolia in Russia.|$|E
5|$|Chewing lice {{live among}} the hairs or {{feathers}} of their host and <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> skin and debris, while sucking lice pierce the host's skin and <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> blood and other secretions. They usually spend their whole {{life on a}} single host, cementing their eggs, which are known as nits, to hairs or feathers. The eggs hatch into nymphs, which moult three times before becoming fully grown, a process that takes about four weeks.|$|E
