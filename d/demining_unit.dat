5000|$|October 25, 2011: Two {{aid workers}} with the Danish Refugee Council's <b>demining</b> <b>unit,</b> American Jessica Buchanan and Dane Poul Hagen Thisted, were {{abducted}} in the north-central Galkayo area. Gunmen from the Al-Shabaab Islamist group were {{alleged to be}} responsible. The hostages were later rescued by US Navy SEALs on January 25, 2012, and taken to Camp Lemonnier at Djibouti's Djibouti-Ambouli International Airport.|$|E
50|$|Both Morocco and the Polisario Front were {{instructed}} to co-operate with the United Nations during the voter identification process. The resolution noted the continuing deployment of engineering <b>units</b> for <b>demining</b> activities and administrative staff required to support the deployment of military personnel. The Council would consider additional deployments only when it became necessary. It called for the prompt conclusion of Status of Forces Agreements {{in relation to the}} military and <b>demining</b> <b>units,</b> and for restrictions on MINURSO aircraft to be lifted.|$|R
40|$|A study {{into the}} field of {{humanitarian}} landmine removal was conducted; with significant attention devoted to an in depth review of existing removal technologies, as well as alternative detection methods. A design proposal was also presented {{in addition to the}} technology review. The design is for an autonomous robot which is capable of working in conjunction with canine <b>demining</b> <b>units,</b> with further implications {{for the development of a}} robotic unit capable of landmine detection. Further investigation was done into the possible modes of robotic locomotion, resulting in the determination that mechanical legs, as opposed to wheels, are the better choice when traversing across soft terrain. by Amanda N.
