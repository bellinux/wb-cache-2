Factors associated with the choice of each MRSD <b>determination</b> <b>method</b> were also identified. PubMed was searched for FIH studies with mAbs published in English between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2013, and the following information was extracted: MRSD <b>determination</b> <b>method,</b> publication year, therapeutic area, antibody type, safety factor, safety assessment results after the first dose, and number of dose escalation steps. Seventy-nine FIH studies with mAbs were identified, 49 of which clearly reported the MRSD <b>determination</b> <b>method.</b> The no observed adverse effects level (NOAEL) -based approach was {{the most frequently used}} method, whereas the model-based approach was the least commonly used method (34. 7 % vs 16. 3 %). The minimal anticipated biological effect level (MABEL) - or minimum effective dose (MED) -based approach was used more frequently in 2011 – 2013 than in 1990 – 2007 (31. 6 % vs 6. 3 %, P= 0. 036), reflecting a slow, but steady acceptance of the European Medicines Agency’s guidance on mitigating risks for FIH clinical trials (2007). The median safety factor was much lower for the MABEL- or MED-based approach than for the other MRSD <b>determination</b> <b>methods</b> (10 vs 32. 2 – 53). The number of dose escalation steps was not significantly different among the different MRSD <b>determination</b> <b>methods.</b> The MABEL-based approach appears to be safer and as efficient as the other MRSD <b>determination</b> <b>methods</b> for achieving the objectives of FIH studies with mAbs faster.

40|$|In this paper, {{there is}} an implementation, verification, and {{graphical}} demonstration of a software application, {{which can be used}} swiftly over different preliminary orbit <b>determination</b> <b>methods.</b> A passive orbit <b>determination</b> <b>method</b> is used in this study to determine the location of a satellite or a flying body. It is named a passive orbit determination because it depends on observation without the use of any aids (radio and laser) installed on satellite. In order to understand how these methods work and how their output is accurate when compared with available verification data, the built models help in knowing the different inputs used with each method. Output from the different orbit <b>determination</b> <b>methods</b> (Gibbs, Lambert, and Gauss) will be compared with each other and verified by the data obtained from Satellite Tool Kit (STK) application. A modified model including all of the orbit <b>determination</b> <b>methods</b> using the same input will be introduced to investigate different models output (orbital parameters) for the same input (azimuth, elevation, and time). Simulation software is implemented using MATLAB. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) application named OrDet is produced using the GUI of MATLAB. It includes all the available used inputs and it outputs the current Classical Orbital Elements (COE) of satellite under observation. Produced COE are then used to propagate for a complete revolution and plotted on a 3 -D view. Modified model which uses an adapter to allow same input parameters, passes these parameters to the preliminary orbit <b>determination</b> <b>methods</b> under study. Result from all orbit <b>determination</b> <b>methods</b> yield exactly the same COE output, which shows the equality of concept in determination of satellite’s location, but with different numerical methods...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{is made of}} the concentrations of metals extracted from soils using the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) and a total <b>determination</b> <b>method.</b> This information is of interest in two ways.

This study looks specifically at inorganic elements (Sb, As, Ba, Cd, Cu, Cr, Pb, Mg, Hg, Se, Ag, Sn, and Zn) in soils from a firing range. Results show that total <b>determination</b> <b>methods</b> for metals can not generally be used for heterogeneous samples, such as soil samples from a firing range. Some correlation between a total <b>determination</b> <b>method</b> and TCLP was observed when Ba and Cd were present in the samples at lower concentrations (less than 80 mg/kg for Ba and less than 25 mg/kg for Cd); however, additional data are necessary to verify this correlation...|$|R

40|$|In {{this chapter}} we will define the design {{criteria}} for a requirements <b>determination</b> <b>method</b> (RDM). When studying the literature on criteria for requirements specification (methods) we have found a number of criteria that have been derived for software requirement specifications (IEEE Std 830, 1998), software specification techniques (Khwaja and Urban, 2002), software requirements and design specifications (Boehm, 1984), the quality of data models (Moody and Shank, 2003; Kesh, 1995), system develoment methodologies (Wysocki and Young, 1990; Essink and Romkema, 1989) and requirements <b>determination</b> <b>methods</b> (Hevner and Mills, 1995). The former references differ {{to a large extent}} in the level of detail and granularity of the criteria that are given. A number of authors make a distinction into criteria for the product (i. e. the requirements specification) and the criteria for the process (i. e. the requirements determination technique or procedure) (Moody and Shanks, 1995; Khwaja and Urban, 2002). In section 2. 1 we will list a number of criteria for software requirements specifications, information system development methodologies and requirements <b>determination</b> <b>methods</b> as found in the literature. 2. 1 CRITERIA FOR RDMs FOUND IN THE LITERATURE In this chapter we will ask ourselves the following question: What are according to the existing requirements determination literature, the quality {{criteria for a}} requirements <b>determination</b> <b>method</b> {{that can be used for}} eliciting, verifying and specifying the complete domain requirements for a given business application subject area in a wide range of business organizations, in an efficient and formal way?

The long-term nitrogen fertilizer location test had been taken since 2007 to analyze the nitrogen uptake rate of wheat year after year and the REN rate was calculated annually. A reasonable measurement specification of REN <b>determination</b> <b>method</b> was put forward. The REN measurement specification was:(1) The wheat nitrogen uptake of CK kept relatively stable after a few years; (2) The wheat nitrogen uptake ratio of fetilized treatment retained stable; (3) REN must be used the average of 3 years of steady period value.

40|$|Robot {{systems in}} {{critical}} applications, {{such as those}} in space and nuclear environments, must be able to operate during component failure to complete important tasks. One failure mode that has received little attention is the failure of joint position sensors. Current fault tolerant designs require the addition of directly redundant position sensors which can affect joint design. A new method is proposed that utilizes analytical redundancy to allow for continued operation during joint position sensor failure. Joint torque sensors are used with a virtual passive torque controller to make the robot joint stable without position feedback and improve position tracking performance in the presence of unknown link dynamics and end-effector loading. Two Cartesian accelerometer based methods are proposed to determine the position of the joint. The joint specific position <b>determination</b> <b>method</b> utilizes two triaxial accelerometers attached to the link driven by the joint with the failed position sensor. The joint specific method is not computationally complex and the position error is bounded. The system wide position <b>determination</b> <b>method</b> utilizes accelerometers distributed on different robot links and the end-effector to determine the position of sets of multiple joints. The system wide method requires fewer accelerometers than the joint specific method to make all joint position sensors fault tolerant but is more computationally complex and has lower convergence properties. Experiments were conducted on a laboratory manipulator. Both position <b>determination</b> <b>methods</b> were shown to track the actual position satisfactorily. A controller using the position <b>determination</b> <b>methods</b> and the virtual passive torque controller was able to servo the joints to a desired position during position sensor failure...|$|R
