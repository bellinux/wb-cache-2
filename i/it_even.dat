5|$|Hale–Bopp became {{visible to}} the naked eye in May 1996, and {{although}} its rate of brightening slowed considerably during the latter half of that year, scientists were still cautiously optimistic that it would become very bright.

5|$|Lead {{encephalopathy}} is {{a medical}} emergency and causes permanent brain damage in 70–80% of children affected by <b>it,</b> <b>even</b> those that receive the best treatment. The mortality rate for people who develop cerebral involvement is about 25%, and of those who survive who had lead encephalopathy symptoms by the time chelation therapy was begun, about 40% have permanent neurological problems such as cerebral palsy.|$|E

The school is told they have no legal recourse, and Willie and Puente are laid off to cover the school's losses.|$|E
5|$|Newton Heath LYR Football Club {{was also}} founded as a cricket club, and the North Road ground {{was used by}} both {{branches}} of the club.

5|$|The Universe can {{be defined}} as {{everything}} that exists, everything that has existed, and everything that will exist. According to our current understanding, the Universe consists of spacetime, forms of energy (including electromagnetic radiation and matter), and the physical laws that relate them.

5|$|The event which devastated {{areas from}} Montgomery to Greene County caused $20,000,000 in damage and injured 20 people.

5|$|The {{history of}} {{observations}} of Mars {{is marked by}} the oppositions of Mars, when the planet is closest to Earth and hence is most easily visible, which occur every couple of years. Even more notable are the perihelic oppositions of Mars, which occur every 15 or 17 years and are distinguished because Mars is close to perihelion, making <b>it</b> <b>even</b> closer to Earth.|$|E
5|$|The upshot is that {{scholars}} cannot assert with any confidence how much material Shakespeare took from the Ur-Hamlet (if <b>it</b> <b>even</b> existed), how much from Belleforest or Saxo, {{and how much}} from other contemporary sources (such as Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy). No clear evidence exists that Shakespeare made any direct references to Saxo's version. However, elements of Belleforest's version which are not in Saxo's story do appear in Shakespeare's play. Whether Shakespeare took these from Belleforest directly or through the Ur-Hamlet remains unclear.|$|E

5|$|Though a small {{shrine in}} the temple complex, the Vimala temple is {{important}} to the Goddess-oriented Shakta and Tantric worshippers, who revere <b>it</b> <b>even</b> more than the main Jagannath shrine. Vimala is considered to be the Tantric consort of Jagannath and a guardian of the temple complex. Devotees pay respect to Vimala before worshipping Jagannath in the main temple. Food offered to Jagannath does not get sanctified as Mahaprasad until it is also offered to Vimala. The Goddess-oriented festival of Durga Puja in the Hindu month of Ashvin (October) is celebrated for sixteen days at Vimala, culminating with Vijayadashami.|$|E
5|$|Adams resented Hamilton's {{influence}} with Washington and considered him overambitious and scandalous {{in his private}} life; Hamilton compared Adams unfavorably with Washington and thought him too emotionally unstable to be President. Hamilton took the election as an opportunity: he urged all the northern electors to vote for Adams and Pinckney, lest Jefferson get in; but he cooperated with Edward Rutledge to have South Carolina's electors vote for Jefferson and Pinckney. If all this worked, Pinckney would have more votes than Adams, Pinckney would become President, and Adams would remain Vice President, {{but it did not}} work. The Federalists found out about <b>it</b> (<b>even</b> the French minister to the United States knew), and northern Federalists voted for Adams but not for Pinckney, in sufficient numbers that Pinckney came in third and Jefferson became Vice President. Adams resented the intrigue since he felt his service to the nation was much more extensive than Pinckney's.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in October of each year, Pleione {{along with}} the rest of the cluster can be seen rising in the east in the early morning before dawn. To see it after sunset, one will need to wait until December. By mid-February, the star is visible to {{virtually}} every inhabited region of the globe, with only those south of 66° unable to see <b>it.</b> <b>Even</b> in cities like Cape Town, South Africa, at the tip of the African continent, the star rises almost 32° above the horizon. Due to its declination of roughly +24°, Pleione is circumpolar in the northern hemisphere at latitudes greater than 66° North. Once late April arrives, the cluster can be spotted briefly in the deepening twilight of the western horizon, soon to disappear with the other setting stars.|$|E
5|$|Characteristic of Marko was his reverence {{and love}} for his mother, Jevrosima; he often sought her advice, {{following}} <b>it</b> <b>even</b> when it contradicted his own desires. She lived with Marko at his mansion in Prilep, his lodestar guiding him away from evil and toward good {{on the path of}} moral improvement and Christian virtues. Marko's honesty and moral courage are noteworthy in a poem in which he was the only person who knew the will of the late Tsar Dušan regarding his heir. Marko refused to lie in favour of the pretenders—his father and uncles. He said truthfully that Dušan appointed his son, Uroš, heir to the Serbian throne. This almost cost him his life, since Vukašin tried to kill him.|$|E
5|$|Despite German {{claims that}} the {{blockage}} did not impede their operations, the operation to close the Ostend canal {{seemed to have been}} at least partially successful. The channel was largely blocked and so Bruges was ostensibly closed off from the open sea, even if the position of the blockship meant that smaller ships could get through. In fact, the entire operation had been rendered moot before <b>it</b> <b>even</b> began, due to events at the wider canal in Zeebrugge. British assessments of that operation had proven optimistic and the channel there had not been properly closed. Small coastal submarines of the UC class had been able to pass through the channel as early as the morning after the Zeebrugge Raid and German naval engineers were able to dredge channels around the blockages at both ports over the coming weeks.|$|E
