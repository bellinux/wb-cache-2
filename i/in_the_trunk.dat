5|$|There are varying {{accounts}} whether Leigh was in {{the shower}} the entire time or a body double was used for {{some parts of the}} murder sequence and its aftermath.

The 2010 book The Girl in Alfred Hitchcock's Shower by Robert Graysmith contradicts this, identifying Marli Renfro as Leigh's body double for some of the shower scene's shots. Graysmith also stated that Hitchcock later acknowledged Renfro's participation in the scene.|$|E

5|$|In a {{fifth and}} final case, (not {{present in the}} {{original}} Game Boy Advance release, but added for the DS and subsequent releases) Phoenix, now running Fey's firm as Wright and Co., is hired by teenager Ema Skye to defend her sister Lana, {{the head of the}} prosecutor's office, in a case where the body of a detective, Bruce Goodman, was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> of Edgeworth's car. Together with Ema, Phoenix traces the origins of the murder to an incident two years prior, in which a serial killer allegedly murdered Edgeworth's predecessor while trying to escape custody. Damon Gant, a senior police captain, is tricked into admitting that he framed Ema for the murder in order to manipulate Lana into doing his bidding. Though Lana is cleared of murder charges, she agrees to resign her post in order to face judgement for protecting Gant. With Ema being sent to Europe to continue training as a forensic investigator, Phoenix looks forward to continuing his career defending the innocent.|$|E
5|$|It {{is illegal}} in New Jersey {{to have an}} open {{container}} of alcohol in the passenger portion of a private automobile, but open bottles of alcohol may be transported <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> of a car, and consumption of alcohol on a bus, train, taxi, limousine, or boat is permitted. The penalty for having an open container of alcohol in a car is $200 fine for the first offense, and a $250 fine or 10 days of community service for repeat violations. The state Motor Vehicle Commission does not impose license points for open container convictions, but some automobile insurance companies impose a surcharge. New Jersey's law on open containers in motor vehicles is compliant with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), a federal act passed in 1998 which reduces the highway funding of states that do not prohibit open containers in passenger areas of automobiles.|$|E
5|$|Junpei and {{the others}} reach the incinerator; Akane disappears and Santa escapes with Ace hostage, {{trapping}} the others inside.

Through morphic fields, she connected to Junpei in the future, witnessing several possible realities and directing Junpei to help him survive. Junpei then faces the same sudoku puzzle Akane did, and relays the solution back to Akane in the past, allowing her to escape with Seven and the other children. Junpei realizes that Akane was Zero and, with assistance from Santa, had recreated the game and all the events she had witnessed in order to ensure her survival and avoid a temporal paradox. As Junpei {{and the others}} escape, they discover that the game had taken place in Building Q the entire time, and that Akane and Santa have fled, leaving behind a car with Ace restrained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk.</b> In the game's epilogue, they drive away hoping to catch up to them and, shortly after, pick up a hitchhiker whom Junpei recognizes as Alice.|$|E
