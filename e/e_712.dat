Our results point to their involvement in presently unrecognized essential Env functions pertinent only in in vivo. Interestingly, changes in the codons for residues 717 – 718 as well as some mutations in residues 714 – 716 abrogated Gag expression but still allowed expression of functional Env in a rev-independent manner.

Here we report findings derived from whole-exome sequencing of 15 EATL-II tumour-normal tissue pairs. The tumour suppressor gene SETD 2 encoding a non-redundant H 3 K 36 -specific trimethyltransferase is altered in 14 / 15 cases (93 %), mainly by loss-of-function mutations and/or loss of the corresponding locus (3 p 21. 31). These alterations consistently correlate with defective H 3 K 36 trimethylation. The JAK/STAT pathway comprises recurrent STAT 5 B (60 %), JAK 3 (46 %) and SH 2 B 3 (20 %) mutations, including a STAT 5 B V <b>712</b> <b>E</b> activating variant. In addition, frequent mutations in TP 53, BRAF and KRAS are observed. Conversely, in EATL-I, no SETD 2, STAT 5 B or JAK 3 mutations are found, and H 3 K 36 trimethylation is preserved. This study describes SETD 2 inactivation as EATL-II molecular hallmark, supports EATL-I and -II being two distinct entities, and defines potential new targets for therapeutic intervention...|$|R

Over the last decades,human influence caused significant populationdeclines in particular {{at the western}} rangeboundary. Despite the initiation of breedingand release programs the genetic structure anddiversity of European common hamsterpopulations is largely unknown. In this study,hamsters from ten localities in five Europeancountries were investigated. Mitochondrialcontrol region was sequenced from 145 animalsrepresenting all sampled populations. 385 hamster were screened for polymorphisms at 11 microsatellite loci. Both marker systemsrevealed extensive genetic differentiationamong European common hamsters. Westernpopulations displayed very low levels of mtDNAdiversity (H = 0 – 0. 2, Alsace, Limburg,Flanders, Baden-Wuerttemberg) compared toeastern populations from Saxony-Anhalt,Thuringia and Southern Moravia (H = 0. 663 – 0. 816). Microsatellite analyses revealed asimilar pattern with low to moderate diversityvalues in western hamsters (A = 1. 636 – 5. 364; H e = 0. 111 – 0. 504) and highlevels of polymorphism in eastern hamsters(A = 8. 909 – 9. 818; H <b>e</b> = 0. <b>712</b> – 0. 786). High microsatellite based F STmeasures (up to 0. 635) suggest a typical islandmodel of distribution with no current gene flowbetween most areas. Western hamster populationsexhibit obvious similarities in mitochondrialhaplotype and microsatellite alleledistributions. Gene trees group westernhamsters consistently together on the samebranch but bootstrap values never reachedsignificance. There are strong indications thatlow diversity in western populations ispartially caused by a joint historic founderevent and not only by recent population breakdowns. Overlapping mitochondrial haplotypesprove a close association between westernhamsters and animals from the east German rangein the recent past which does not support theexistence of a separate subspecies C. c. canescens in Europe.

40|$|Cellulase {{constitute}} {{the third largest}} group of enzymes employed in the industry for the processing of food, textile, detergents, paper and pulp and conversion of agricultural biomass into bio fuel and other useful products. The present study therefore was focused on production of cellulases from Trichoderma harzianum for employing in various applications. Trichoderma harzianum after qualitative screening on carboxymethyl cellulose agar and cellulose Azure was utilized {{for the production of}} endoglucanase, exoglucanase and Ã¢- glucosidase. Mandel`s mineral salt medium was found to be suitable for the production of cellulases in submerged culture at 120 rpm. Significant improvements in specific activities of cellulases were recorded in the Mandelâ€™s salt medium supplemented with 3 % wheat bran and 0. 06 % lactose as an inducer and addition of Tween 80 further facilitated cellulase production. Maximum production of all the enzymes was achieved between 72 - 96 hours of fermentation in most of the production parameter notable activities were achieved at 96 hours. The enzyme production was favorable at temperature of 25 Â°C and 30 Â°C with optimum production reported at 30 Â°C with significant specific activities of endoglucanase (137. 3 U/mg), exoglucanase (80. 63 U/mg) and Ã¢-glucosidase (106. 88 U/mg). pH 5. 0 brought significant production of endoglucanase (139. 26 U/mg), exoglucanase(90. 12 U/mg) and Ã¢-glucosidase (109. 88 U/mg). Purification was carried out on Sephadex G- 100, which revealed two distinct peaks of enzyme activity. Lyophilized fractions with 425. 7 % yield for endoglucanase, 464. 6 % exoglucanase and 468 % Ã¢-glucosidase were subjected to SDS-PAGE for the determination of molecular weights that resulted in separation of protein into five bands of 95 KDa, 75 KDa, 65 KDa, 60 KDa and 20 KDa. Characterization of crude and purified cellulases indicated maximum residual activities of crude cellulases between 35 - 55 Â°C with maximum activities attained at 45 Â°C. The temperature optima of purified cellulases shifted from 45 Â°C to 50 Â°C for endoglucanse and exoglucanase and to 55 Â°C for Ã¢-glucosidase. Study of residual activity of crude and purified cellulases in varying pH revealed that the enzymes have a broad pH range both crude and purified fractions were most active at pH 5 6. 5 with maximum residual activities retained at pH 5. 5. Metal ions like Mn 2 +, Zn 2 +, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, K, and Na had stimulatory effect on the activity of crude as well as purified cellulases Fe 2 + ion neither inhibited nor had a stimulatory effect. Lead, Hg 2 + and Cu 2 + had maximum inhibitory effect. Co 2 + inhibited endoglucanase and exoglucanase activity while a slight inhibition was reported in case of Ã¢-glucosidase. Enzyme activities of purified enzymes were stimulated by mercaptoethanol. SDS and EDTA had a slight inhibitory effect. Crude enzyme were supplemented in a high fiber formulated poultry feed. Seven dietary treatments comprising of four dietary doses of cellulases only, two dietary mixed doses with cellulases and proteases and a dietary dose without enzyme supplementation that was kept as a control were fed to birds over a period o f 43 days. Enzyme supplementation resulted in increase in average weight gain of all the treatments when compared with control. 156 g more weight than control group (A) was recorded in group E (16 ml cellulase /kg feed) on 43 rd day. A decrease in feed conversion ratio was recorded in all the treatment groups that were linear with increasing enzyme doses. With increasing cellulase dose a decrease in viscosity was noted. In vitro maximum viscosity (1. 29 cP) was recorded in control group (A) and minimum was in group <b>E</b> (0. <b>712</b> cP). Similar results were reported for In vivo viscosity studies of digesta from live birds with maximum figure (1. 089 cP) in control group (A) and maximum reduction was attained in group E (0. 521). Dry matter digestibility in control group (80. 58 %) was less than in all treatment groups with maximum reported in group G (91. 08 %). Deinking of different type of waste paper resulted in increase in color units of all treated pulps over their respective controls. An average of 2 % increase in brightness index of all treated pulps was achieved. Image analysis revealed reduction of residual ink (%) in all the enzyme treated hand sheets. The crude enzyme was found to be stable in all five commercial detergents used, with 90 % of residual activity retained after 1 hour of incubation at 40 Â°C in detergent A. More than 40 % residual activity was retained in rest of the detergents after one hour. The crude enzyme was active in removing/fading different type of stains and along with detergent the cleaning power was enhanced further. The crude preparation of cellulases was also successful in biostoning of denim bringing out an even faded look of the garment with an additional advantage of negligible back staining...|$|R
40|$|A Fibrose Cística (FC) é a doença autossômica recessiva mais freqüente em caucasianos e está associada, em seu amplo espectro de apresentação clínica, a mais de 1500 mutações no gene CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane {{conductance}} regulator). O papel de CFTR é especialmente relevante no desenvolvimento da porção reprodutiva dos ductos mesonéfricos. Em 98 % dos pacientes masculinos portadores da FC, mutações em CFTR são responsáveis pela ausência bilateral congênita dos ductos deferentes (CBAVD), associada à anomalias variáveis das vesículas seminais, ductos ejaculatórios e da porção distal dos epidídimos. A ausência uni ou bilateral congênita dos ductos deferentes (CAVD), na ausência de outros sinais clínicos de FC, é conhecida causa de infertilidade masculina, presente em 1 %- 2 % de todos os homens inférteis, e em cerca de 10 % dos azoospérmicos. A reprodução assistida utilizando a injeção intracitoplasmática de espermatozóides (ICSI) obtidos preferencialmente por aspiração microcirurgica de espermatozóides do epidídimo (MESA) permite a paternidade biológica a esses pacientes. Em função da alta morbi-mortalidade da FC e da alta freqüência de portadores assintomáticos, estimada em 1 : 25, é recomendável que seja realizado teste para identificação de mutações em CFTR em todos os pacientes com CAVD antes de serem submetidos à ICSI. Em populações de etnia homogênea, a mutação F 508 é identificada em 90 % dos pacientes com FC e em 70 % a 85 % dos pacientes com CAVD. No Brasil, onde diferenças étnicas refletem a heterogeneidade genética, a freqüência da mutação F 508 varia entre 23 % e 50 % em paciente com FC indicando que outras mutações devam estar envolvidas. Este dado levou ao estudo completo do gene CFTR de 20 homens inférteis com CAVD visando a identificação das mutações mais prevalentes em nossa população. Foram identificadas mutações em 17 pacientes (85 %) : três DF 508 representando 15 % (3 / 20), uma G 542 X, uma 875 + 1 G>A e 4 mutações ainda não descritas na literatura, a S 753 R, G 149 W identificada em dois irmãos, V 580 F <b>e</b> a <b>712</b> - 1 G>T. A variação no trato polipirimidínico em IVS 8 (alelo 5 T), seja como segunda mutação ou presente em homozigose, está diretamente relacionada com a CAVD, com freqüências em população caucasiana masculina infértil variando entre 21 % e 30 %. No presente estudo, 15 (15 / 20 = 75 %) pacientes apresentaram o alelo a variante alélica 5 T sendo que em 8 pacientes essa variante alélica foi identificada em heterozigose composta com outra mutação. Anomalias renais foram identificadas em 6 pacientes, todos com CBAVD. O presente estudo pode correlacionar o fenótipo da CAVD a alterações no genótipo de CFTR em 100 % dos pacientes investigadosCystic Fibrosis (CF) is {{the most}} common autosomal recessive disorder in caucasians and is associated, in an wide variety of different clinical manifestatons. More than 1500 mutations in the CFTR gene (Cystic Fibrosis regulator Transmembrane conductance) have been described and an even growing number of mutations are being currently studied worldwide. The role of CFTR gene is especially important in reproductive tissues of the mesonephric tract sensitive to the expression of the CFTR gene. The great majority of infertile males with CF (98 %) have clinical manifestations and mutations in CFTR are responsible for the congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), associated to the abnormalities of the seminal vesicles, ejaculatory ducts and/or the distal portion of the epididymis. The congenital absence, uni or bilateral, of the vas deferens (CAVD), in the absence of other clinical signals of CF is a known cause of male infertility present in 1 %- 2 % of all men investigated and in about 10 % of men with obstructive azoospermia. Serious considerations should be drawn about the lack of proper diagnosis of infetile males with CFTR that seek reproductive clinics for assisted reproductive techniques (ARTs), as well as the lack of proper consideratins of the existance of this disease as a potential cause of male infetility among male are takers, like urologistas, andrologistas and gynecologists that rush for the misuse of ARTs. The introduction of Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI), has given new reproductive potetntial for these couples, but again as in the majority of cases it is obstructive azoospermia, couples should be advised about proper microsurgical sperm retrieval, preferentialy microsurgical epydidymal sperm aspiration (MESA). As a consequence of the potential high mortality rate of the CF descendents and the high frequency of carriers, estimated in 1 : 25,it is highly recommended that tests for correct identification of mutations in CFTR gene are carried out for all patients with CAVD before considered being submitted to ICSI. In populations of homogeneous ethnic origin, the mutation F 508 is identified in 90 % of the patients with CF and between 70 % and 85 % of the patients with CAVD. In Brazil, where ethnic differences reflect the genetic heterogeneity, the frequency of the mutation in F 508 varies between 23 % and 50 %, indicating that other mutations must have a role. Our data looked carefully in the CFTR gene of 20 infertile men with CAVD aiming at the identification of the most prevalent mutations in our population. Mutations had been identified in 17 patients (85 %) : three DF 508 representing 15 % (3 / 20), one G 542 X, one 875 + 1 G>A and 4 mutations not yet described in literature, S 753 R, G 149 W identified in two brothers, V 580 F and 712 - 1 G>T. In the literature the allelic variant in IVS 8 (allele 5 T), either as a second mutation or in homozygosis, is directly related with the CAVD, with reported frequencies in the infertile caucasian male population varying between 21 % and 30 %. In the present study, 15 (15 / 20 = 75 %) patients presented the CFTR mutation in the IVS 8 / 5 T: eight of them in heterozygosis composed with another mutation. Regarding genitourinary tract malformations, kidney anomalies were identified in 6 patients, all with CBAVD. In the present study we could correlationate the phenotype of the CAVD with the genotype alterations of CFTR gene in 100 % of the investigated patient...|$|R

Each of the complexes were characterized by UV/vis, visible emission, IV, 1 H NMR and cyclic voltammetric studies. The UV-vis spectra shows bands in the visible region (approximately 460 nm) assigned to metal to ligand charge transfer transition (MLCT). Both complexes showed strong luminescent bands in the visible region with an excited-state lifetime of 712 and 787 ns for [Ru(dcbpy 2) mbpy-naf] 2 + and [Ru(dcbpy 2) mbpy-ant] 2 +, respectively. The Ru(II) /(III) couple in the complexes are shifted (1. 36 V vs Ag/AgCl) positively with regard to that of the starting complex (0. 50 V vs Ag/AgCl). The photovoltaic performance of the solar cells based on these complexes was obtained under AM 1. 5 conditions. The overall efficiency of energy conversion (&# 951;) are much lower than those achieved for the dye cis- [Ru(dcbpy) 2 (NCS) 2] (N 3) under the same experimental conditions. The compounds were also investigated with respect on their 1 O 2 generation quantum yields, with irradiation at 350, 419 and 575 nm, and photocleavage capabilities on DNA.
