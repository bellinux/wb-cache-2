5|$|After the 23 July {{show at the}} Day on the Green festival at the Oakland Coliseum in Oakland, California, Bonham {{and members}} of Led Zeppelin's support staff were arrested after a member of {{promoter}} Bill Graham's staff was badly beaten during the band's performance. The following day's second Oakland concert was the group's final live appearance in the United States. Two days later, as they checked in at a <b>French</b> <b>Quarter</b> hotel for their 30 July performance at the Louisiana Superdome, Plant received news that his five-year-old son, Karac, had died from a stomach virus. The rest of the tour was immediately cancelled, prompting widespread speculation about Led Zeppelin's future.|$|E
5|$|As Prince of Wales, George Augustus {{bore the}} royal arms (with an inescutcheon of Gules plain in the Hanoverian quarter), differenced by a label of three points Argent. The arms {{included}} the royal crest and supporters {{but with the}} single arched coronet of his rank, all charged on the shoulder with a similar label. His arms followed {{the change in the}} royal arms in 1801, when the Hanoverian quarter became an inescutcheon and the <b>French</b> <b>quarter</b> was dropped altogether. The 1816 alteration did not affect him as it only applied to the arms of the King.|$|E

5|$|On 1 May 1707, the kingdoms of England and Scotland were merged to {{form that}} of Great Britain; this was {{reflected}} by impaling their {{arms in a}} single quarter. The claim to the French throne continued, albeit passively, until it was mooted by the French Revolution {{and the formation of}} the French First Republic in 1792. During the peace negotiations at the Conference of Lille, from July to November 1797, the French delegates demanded that the King of Great Britain abandon the title of King of France as a condition of peace. The Acts of Union 1800 united the Kingdom of Great Britain with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Under King George III of the United Kingdom, a proclamation of 1 January 1801 set the royal style and titles and modified the Royal Arms, removing the <b>French</b> <b>quarter</b> and putting the arms of England, Scotland and Ireland on the same structural level, with the dynastic arms of Hanover moved to an inescutcheon.|$|E
5|$|The sex scene {{involving}} Rourke and Bonet {{was filmed}} {{in one of}} the unused buildings located on Royal Street and took four hours to shoot. Parker limited the crew down to himself, cinematographer Michael Seresin, camera operator Michael Roberts and the camera assistant. To make the actors more comfortable, Parker played music during the shoot. Production then moved to a corner of New Orleans, which doubled for flashback sequences set in 1943 Times Square, New York. The crew then discovered an unused bus depot, which was used to film scenes set in Ethan Krusemark's gumbo hut. Filming then moved to the St. Alphonsus Church, where the crew filmed a dialogue scene between Angel and Cyphre. Production returned to Royal Street in the <b>French</b> <b>Quarter,</b> where the final confrontation between Angel and Cyphre, and the film's ending were shot.|$|E

The Historic New Orleans Collection's Williams Research Center Annex was the first new construction completed in the <b>French</b> <b>Quarter</b> after Hurricane Katrina. In September 2015, SBP (a disaster relief organization that began after the hurricane), broke ground its new headquarters, moving from Chalmette to a 25,000-square-foot former salvage company on Toulouse Street as part of a $7.2 million relocation effort. The organization moved into its new space in May 2016. The building is also serves as the national hub for the Disaster Resilience and Recovery Lab.|$|E

25|$|The {{victory was}} {{important}} {{for the preservation of}} the <b>French</b> <b>Quarter,</b> but it was hardly the only challenge. Throughout the 1960s, new hotels opened regularly, often replacing large sections of the <b>French</b> <b>Quarter.</b> The VCC approved these structures as long as their designers adhered to prevailing exterior styles. Detractors, fearing that the Vieux Carré's charm might be compromised by the introduction of too many new inns, lobbied successfully for passage in 1969 of a municipal ordinance that forbade new hotels within the district's boundaries. However, the ordinance failed to stop the proliferation of timeshare condominiums and clandestine bed and breakfast inns throughout the <b>French</b> <b>Quarter</b> or high-rise hotels just outside its boundaries. In the 1980s, many long-term residents were driven away by rising rents, as property values rose dramatically with expectations of windfalls from the planned 1984 World's Fair.|$|E
50|$|The {{house was}} built in 1883, and was {{probably}} the only brick house built in Lewiston's 19th-century <b>French</b> <b>quarters.</b> Dr. Louis J.

In addition, the Quarter largely escaped the looting and violence that occurred after the storm; nearly all of the antique shops and art galleries in the <b>French</b> <b>Quarter,</b> for example, were untouched.|$|E

After this purchase, Handy's company began to acquire and market brands of liquor.

The company publishes a Sazerac recipe and produces a Peychaud's Bitters named after Peychaud, which is an ingredient in the traditional Sazerac cocktail.|$|R
