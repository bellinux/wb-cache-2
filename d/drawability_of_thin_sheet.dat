40|$|In this study, a novel {{manufacturing}} process is proposed {{as an alternative}} method for fabrication of double metallic bipolar plates from initially flat <b>thin</b> <b>sheets.</b> The proposed process combined hydroforming <b>of</b> <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> metal blanks to create micro-channel arrays with in-die mechanical bonding to create double bipolar plates in a single-step and single-die operation to result in thin, lightweight, and flexible bipolar plates where flow fields are formed {{on both sides and}} internal cooling channels are formed in the middle, eliminating further welding, assembly and sealing operations otherwise required with the existing methods. For a successful development of the proposed process, different scientific and research issues are investigated and discussed in this study. First, to characterize the material behavior <b>of</b> <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> metals at micro-scale, hydraulic bulge tests are performed to investigate the so-called “size effects” (i. e., grain, specimen, and feature size) on the material behavior. Based on the bulge test results, new material models are developed to include the size effect parameters. Second, to understand the deformation mechanics <b>of</b> <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> metals in micro-feature fabrication under complex loading conditions, hydroforming of different micro-channel sizes using <b>thin</b> <b>sheets</b> is performed. Effects of channel design and process condition on the overall channel formability are discussed. With the use of FEA and appropriate material models, a parametric study is conducted to establish design guidelines for process and tooling design. Third, a mechanical bonding process, specifically, pressure welding <b>of</b> <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> metals, is investigated to gain a full understanding of the process limitation and characterization. The understanding from the welding tests suggests different process windows for successful bonding <b>of</b> <b>thin</b> <b>sheets.</b> Finally, predictive process models of the hybrid process are developed using a finite element (FE) tool for rapid evaluation the process producibility. Based on the simulation results, a set of experimental tooling is developed and tested to demonstrate the feasibility of the hybrid process for fabrication of fuel cell bipolar plates in a single-step and single-die operation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Laser welding <b>of</b> <b>thin</b> <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> AISI 304 {{stainless}} steel was carried out with high power CW CO 2 laser. The laser power utilized in the welding process was estimated using the experimental results and the dimensionless parameter model for laser welding; and also the energy balance equation model. Variation of laser welding efficiency with welding speed and mode of welding was studied. Welding efficiency was high for high-speed conduction welding <b>of</b> <b>thin</b> <b>sheets</b> and also in keyhole welding process at high laser powers. Effect of pre-oxidization of the sur-face and powder as filler material on laser power coupling is also reported.

40|$|The {{structural}} behaviour {{of single}} shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single shear screwed connections <b>of</b> <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> steels at elevated temperatures {{has been investigated}} in this study. The current design rules on bolted and screwed connections <b>of</b> <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> steels for cold-formed steel structures are applicable for ambient temperature condition only. These design rules may not be applicable for elevated temperature conditions. Therefore, design guidelines should be prepared for bolted and screwed connections of cold-formed steel structures at elevated temperatures. A total of 30 tensile coupon tests were conducted to investigate the material deterioration <b>of</b> the <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> steels at elevated temperatures, and also to determine the critical temperatures for connection tests. A total of 510 tests on single shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single shear screwed connections <b>of</b> <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> steels at elevated temperatures was performed in the temperature ranged from 22 to 900 ?C using both steady state and transient state test methods. The test results were compared with the predicted values calculated from the North American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications for coldformed steel structures. In calculating the nominal strengths of the connections, the reduced material properties <b>of</b> the <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> steels were used due to the deterioration of material at elevated temperatures. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by these specifications are generally conservative at elevated temperatures. Finite element models for single shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single shear screwed connections were developed and verified against the experimental results. Explicit dynamic analysis technique {{was used in the}} numerical analyses. Extensive parametric studies that included 490 finite element specimens were carried out using the verified finite element models to evaluate the bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as the tilting and bearing strengths of screwed connections <b>of</b> <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> steels at elevated temperatures. Design equations for bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as design equations for tilting and bearing strengths of screwed connections were proposed based on both the experimental and the numerical results in the temperature ranged from 22 to 900 ?C. The bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as the tilting and bearing strengths of screwed connections obtained from the test specimens and the finite element analyses were compared with the predicted strengths calculated using the proposed design equations and also compared with the design strengths calculated using the current North American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications with consideration of the reduced material properties at elevated temperatures. It is shown that the proposed design equations are generally more accurate and reliable in predicting the bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as the tilting and bearing strengths of screwed connections <b>of</b> <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> steels at elevated temperatures than the current design rules. The reliability of the current and proposed design rules was evaluated using reliability analysis. The proposed design equations are suitable for bolted and screwed connections assembled using <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> steels <b>of</b> thickness ranged from 0. 35 to 3. 20 mm. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
