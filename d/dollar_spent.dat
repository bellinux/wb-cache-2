5|$|In the {{developing}} world, birth control increases economic growth due to there being fewer dependent children {{and thus more}} women participating in the workforce. Women's earnings, assets, body mass index, and their children's schooling and body mass index all improve with greater access to birth control. Family planning via the use of modern birth control {{is one of the}} most cost-effective health interventions. For every <b>dollar</b> <b>spent,</b> the United Nations estimates that two to six dollars are saved. These cost savings are related to preventing unplanned pregnancies and decreasing the spread of sexually transmitted illnesses. While all methods are beneficial financially, the use of copper IUDs resulted in the greatest savings.|$|E
25|$|In September 2009, JetBlue made {{changes to}} its TrueBlue program. In the new program, members receive three points for every <b>dollar</b> <b>spent</b> toward a flight, {{excluding}} taxes and fees; members earn an additional three points for every <b>dollar</b> <b>spent</b> {{on a flight}} if they book online on the JetBlue.com website. An additional two points are awarded if the member uses JetBlue cobranded American Express credit card to purchase the flight. The price of flights in points depend on the fare of the flight in U.S. dollars. The new program launched on November 9, 2009.|$|E
25|$|In June 2013, JetBlue {{announced}} that TrueBlue points will never expire for any reason. The current policy states that if members book a flight online, they can earn double with 6 points per dollar. Flights bought elsewhere result in 3 points per <b>dollar</b> <b>spent.</b>|$|E

25|$|Even {{excluding}} {{residents from}} the visitor count, Times Square is the world's second most visited tourist attraction, behind the Las Vegas Strip. The {{high level of}} pedestrian traffic has resulted in $4.8 billion in annual retail, entertainment and hotel sales, with 22 cents out of every <b>dollar</b> <b>spent</b> by visitors in New York City being spent within Times Square.|$|E
25|$|Western {{designers}} {{often feel}} the need to tinker with the proa. They are attracted by the minimalist nature and amazing speeds that proas are capable of (they may still be the fastest sailboats per <b>dollar</b> <b>spent</b> for the home builder) but they often want the proa to do more; adding cabins, different sailing rigs, and bidirectional rudders are common changes made. James Wharram was greatly influenced by the Proa design.|$|E
25|$|The World Health Organization {{estimates}} that Vitamin A supplementation has averted 1.25 million deaths due to vitamin A deficiency in 40 countries since 1998.

25|$|Initially, Velocity was {{different}} from most other frequent flyer programs, as points were earned relative {{to the cost of}} a flight, rather than distance. Velocity members originally earned 6 points per <b>dollar</b> <b>spent</b> on Virgin Australia flights. This was later altered due to the introduction of status levels; Red members now earned 5 points per dollar, Silver members remained at 6 points, and Gold members earned 7. Points accrual on V Australia, as well as the majority of Velocity's airline partners, have always based on distance.|$|E
25|$|Nielsen Media Research {{was founded}} by Arthur C. Nielsen, a market analyst whose career had begun in the 1920s with brand {{advertising}} analysis and had expanded into radio market analysis during the 1930s, culminating in Nielsen ratings of radio programming, which was meant to provide statistics as to the markets of radio shows. The first Nielsen ratings for radio programs were released {{the first week of}} December 1947. They measured the top 20 programs in four areas: total audience, average audience, cumulative audience and homes per <b>dollar</b> <b>spent</b> for time and talent.|$|E

Each 1,250 points accrued would earn the customer a $25 gift card, provided $1,500 was spent each year. With the relaunch of the Myer store card in November 2006, this changed to awards 2 points per $1 spent, regardless of annual spend, with 2,000 points required {{to receive a}} $20 gift card. Members who pay with a Myer store card receive an additional point per <b>dollar</b> <b>spent.</b> Customers also earn 1-point for every $1 spent outside of Myer when using the Myer Visa card.|$|E

50|$|A {{reward system}} (local, as well from the government) was active from 1846 {{to the end}} of the 20th century, but there is no {{evidence}} that - despite the billions of <b>dollars</b> <b>spent</b> - it was ever an efficient control method. Therefore, its importance declined over time.|$|R
25|$|When the {{streaming}} service first launched, Netflix's disc rental subscribers {{were given}} access at no additional charge. Subscribers were allowed approximately {{one hour of}} streaming per <b>dollar</b> <b>spent</b> on the monthly subscription (a $16.99 plan, for example, entitled the subscriber to 17 hours of streaming media). In January 2008, however, Netflix lifted this restriction, at which point virtually all rental-disc subscribers became entitled to unlimited streaming {{at no additional cost}} (however, subscribers on the restricted plan of two DVDs per month ($4.99) remained limited to two hours of streaming per month). This change came in a response to the introduction of Hulu and to Apple's new video-rental services. Netflix later split DVD rental subscriptions and streaming subscriptions into separate, standalone services, at which point the monthly caps on Internet streaming were lifted.|$|E
25|$|Investment {{in public}} {{transport}} also has secondary {{positive effects on}} the local economy, with between $4 and $9 of economic activity resulting from every <b>dollar</b> <b>spent.</b> Many businesses rely on access to a transit system, in particular in cities and countries where access to cars is less widespread, businesses which require {{large numbers of people}} going to a same place {{may not be able to}} accommodate a large number of cars (concert venues, sport stadia, airports, exhibitions centres,...), or businesses where people are not able to use a car (bars, hospitals, or industries in the tourism sector whose customers may not have their cars). Transit systems also have an effect on derived businesses: commercial websites have been founded, such as Hopstop.com, that give directions through mass transit systems; in some cities, such as London, products themed on the local transport system are a popular tourist souvenir. Research in the Washington, DC area shows that public transport does a better job of providing high-skill residents with access to high-skill jobs than it does mid-skill residents to mid-skill jobs and low-skill residents to low-skill jobs.|$|E
500|$|Stampede {{officials}} {{estimated in}} 2009 {{that the city}} of Calgary had a gross economic impact of $172.4 million from the ten-day event alone, with a wider provincial total of $226.7 million. [...] In terms of economic impact, the Stampede is the highest grossing festival in Canada, ahead of Ottawa's Winterlude, the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, and the Just for Laughs festival in Montreal. [...] Additionally, Stampede officials estimate that for every <b>dollar</b> <b>spent</b> at Stampede Park, tourists spend $2.65 {{in the rest of}} the city. A poll conducted in 2011 found that 40 percent of Calgarians who intended to attend the Stampede expected to spend $150–$400 over the course of the event, and 7 percent stated that they would spend more than that.|$|E

500|$|The notion {{has also}} {{diverted}} attention and resources away from efforts {{to determine the}} causes of autism. The 2004 Institute of Medicine report committee recommended that while it supported [...] "targeted research that focuses on better understanding the disease of autism, from a public health perspective the committee does not consider a significant investment in studies of the theoretical vaccine-autism connection to be useful at this time." [...] Alison Singer, a senior executive of Autism Speaks, resigned from the group in 2009 {{in a dispute over}} whether to fund more research on links between vaccination and autism, saying, [...] "There isn't an unlimited pot of money, and every <b>dollar</b> <b>spent</b> looking where we know the answer isn't is one less dollar we have to spend where we might find new answers." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} year of implementation, the FairTax {{legislation}} would apply a 23% federal retail sales tax on the total transaction value of a purchase; in other words, consumers pay to the government 23 cents of every <b>dollar</b> <b>spent</b> in total (sometimes called tax-inclusive, and presented this way to provide a direct comparison with individual income and employment taxes which reduce a person's available money before they can make purchases). The equivalent assessed tax rate is 30% if the FairTax is applied to the pre-tax price of a good like traditional U.S. state sales taxes (sometimes called tax-exclusive; this rate is not directly comparable with existing income and employment taxes). [...] After {{the first year}} of implementation, this tax rate would be automatically adjusted annually using a formula specified in the legislation that reflects actual federal receipts in the previous fiscal year.|$|E
500|$|After the war, Lawrence campaigned {{extensively}} {{for government}} sponsorship of large scientific programs. He was a forceful advocate of Big Science with its requirements for big machines and big money, and in 1946 {{he asked the}} Manhattan Project for over $2 million for research at the Radiation Laboratory. Groves approved the money, but cut a number of programs, including Seaborg's proposal for a [...] "hot" [...] radiation laboratory in densely populated Berkeley, and John Lawrence's for production of medical isotopes, because this need could now be better met from nuclear reactors. One obstacle was the University of California, which was eager to divest its wartime military obligations. Lawrence and Groves managed to persuade Sproul to accept a contract extension. In 1946, the Manhattan Project spent $7 on physics at the University of California for every <b>dollar</b> <b>spent</b> by the University.|$|E

500|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, Briskin had gained a {{reputation}} of being a very thrifty producer. However, he was also known for putting {{the quality of the}} product over saving money. Joseph Walker, the cinematographer for the 1931 film Dirigible, directed by Frank Capra, explained why the film had not used stock footage of blimps, which would have been much less expensive: , the studio's general manager, who personally supervised the making of the picture, and who is perhaps more keenly exacting in the matter of getting a full dollar's worth of production for every <b>dollar</b> <b>spent</b> than any other executive in the business, was wise enough to see that an otherwise superlative production would fall flat if such scenes were made [...] "merely adequate". Therefore he spared no expense in assuring absolute authenticity in every detail of the production.|$|E
2500|$|Cabinet {{documents}} and the previously secret business case and construction contract details were {{released by the}} incoming state government in December 2014, revealing {{for the first time}} the costing rationale for the project. An initial assessment in March 2013 had found the road would return 45 cents in benefits for every <b>dollar</b> <b>spent.</b> When [...] "wider economic benefits" [...] were factored in, the return rose to 84 cents for every <b>dollar</b> <b>spent.</b> Cabinet documents showed the Napthine government opted not to submit the business case to Infrastructure Australia, fearing it could reject the project because of the poor cost-benefit ratio. Three months later the government prepared a new business case that included other measures, including the widening of CityLink, the Tullamarine Freeway and the Eastern Freeway, to produce an estimated return of $1.40 for every dollar invested. Those figures were used by the government in a short-form business case it presented to Infrastructure Australia.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{utilitarian}} {{principle of}} seeking the greatest {{good for the}} greatest number – economic inequality is problematic. A house that provides less utility to a millionaire as a summer home than it would to a homeless family of five, {{is an example of}} reduced [...] "distributive efficiency" [...] within society, that decreases marginal utility of wealth and thus the sum total of personal utility. [...] An additional <b>dollar</b> <b>spent</b> by a poor person will go to things providing a great deal of utility to that person, such as basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare; while, an additional <b>dollar</b> <b>spent</b> by a much richer person will very likely go to luxury items providing relatively less utility to that person. Thus, the marginal utility of wealth per person ("the additional dollar") decreases as a person becomes richer. [...] From this standpoint, for any given amount of wealth in society, a society with more equality will have higher aggregate utility. Some studies have found evidence for this theory, noting that in societies where inequality is lower, population-wide satisfaction and happiness tend to be higher.|$|E
