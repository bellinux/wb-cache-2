40|$|Abstract: As {{educators}} we {{are constantly}} revising our teaching <b>delivery</b> <b>methods</b> to accommodate the ever diversifying demographic catchments of students. In the last 10 to 15 years, teaching has evolved from teacher centred chalk and talk to student centred online learning. Technology has driven further changes in pedagogical strategies. <b>Delivery</b> <b>methods</b> have evolved to reflect these pedagogical strategies often resulting in a blended solution. This paper examines the benefits and disadvantages of various <b>delivery</b> <b>methods</b> and suggests recipes for blending the different approaches. The ingredients for the blending include lectures, group discussion in various environments, apprenticeship, film, Computer Assisted Learning (CAL), e-learning and experiential learning. Our discussion examines {{the reasons for the}} failure of a single strategy delivery in today’s climate and discusses the benefits of blending <b>delivery</b> <b>methods.</b> We construct a simple framework for the selection of <b>delivery</b> <b>methods</b> applicable to computing courses, and provide examples in the use of this framework...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the recent changes to different <b>delivery</b> <b>methods</b> for a residential construction management course {{at a major}} university. The project-based course was delivered similarly to a capstone course by combining Residential Methods, Estimating, Scheduling, and Contracts into one class with one overall final project. The course introduced students to land acquisition, land development, construction services, operations, finance, marketing, and sales. Information about the course’s 14 different <b>delivery</b> <b>methods</b> and the recent changes is provided in this paper. The recent changes {{are based on a}} survey that was conducted to obtain the students’ perspectives about the course <b>delivery</b> <b>methods</b> and combination of methods students preferred and found effective. Students also provided insight on additional <b>delivery</b> <b>methods</b> they preferred and found effective from other courses that provided insight to the recent changes. The results of the student surveys are presented and discussed. Survey results led to two alternative <b>delivery</b> <b>methods</b> that have been recently adopted in the course. These methods are: 1) providing opportunities for students to build residential assemblies outside the classroom in collaboration with industry professionals on full-scale projects by applying knowledge learned in class, and 2) new interactive electronic reading.

40|$|Purpose: Magnetic {{resonance}} elastography (MRE) of {{the brain}} is being explored as a biomarker of neurodegenerative disease such as dementia. However, MRE measures for healthy brain have varied widely. Differing wave delivery methodologies may have influenced this, hence finite element-based simulations were carried out to explore this possibility.

Displacement fields and the corresponding brain constitutive properties estimated by standard inversion techniques were compared across <b>delivery</b> <b>methods</b> and frequencies. Results: The <b>delivery</b> <b>methods</b> produced widely different MRE displacement fields and inversions. Furthermore, resonances at natural frequencies influenced the displacement patterns.

25|$|The <b>delivery</b> <b>method</b> {{determines the}} dose {{required}} to raise an effective immune response. Saline injections require variable amounts of DNA, from 10μg-1mg, whereas gene gun deliveries require 100 to 1000 times. Generally, 0.2μg – 20μg are required, although quantities {{as low as}} 16ng have been reported. These quantities vary by species. Mice for example, require approximately 10 times less DNA than primates. Saline injections require more DNA because the DNA is delivered to the extracellular spaces of the target tissue (normally muscle), where it has to overcome physical barriers (such as the basal lamina and large amounts of connective tissue, to mention a few) before it is {{taken up by the}} cells, while gene gun deliveries bombard DNA directly into the cells, resulting in less “wastage”.|$|E
25|$|One way of {{administering}} resveratrol {{in humans}} may be buccal delivery, that is without swallowing, by direct absorption through tissues {{on the inside}} of the mouth. When one milligram of resveratrol in 50 ml 50% alcohol/ water solution was retained in the mouth for one minute before swallowing, 37nbsp&ng/ml of free resveratrol was measured in plasma two minutes later. This level of unchanged resveratrol in blood can only be achieved with 250nbsp&mg of resveratrol taken in a pill form. However, the viability of a buccal <b>delivery</b> <b>method</b> is called into question due to the low aqueous solubility of the molecule. For a drug to be absorbed transmucosally it must be in free-form or dissolved. Resveratrol fits the criteria for oral transmucosal dosing, except for this caveat. The low aqueous solubility greatly limits the amount that can be absorbed through the buccal mucosa. Resveratrol that is attempted to be taken buccally was expected to pass through the mucous membrane of the mouth and be absorbed as an oral dose, however, the need to explore buccal delivery in future pharmaceutical formulations was expressed.|$|E
