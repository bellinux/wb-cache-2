2500|$|Around noon August 23, 1917, Lee Sparks and Rufus Daniels, two Houston police officers, {{broke up}} a craps game {{on a street}} corner in Houston's predominantly-black San Felipe {{district}} by firing warning shots. Sparks, searching for the fleeing suspects, entered the house of local resident Sara Travers. He did not find the suspect but, after exchanging words with Travers, struck her and dragged her outside <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>nightgown.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On Friday, May 3, {{sometime}} before 9 p.m., Virgil Starks, age 37, a farmer and welder, {{was in his}} modest, yet modern ranch-style house on his 500-acre farm off Highway 67 East, almost [...] northeast of Texarkana. He turned on his favorite weekly radio show and his wife, Katie, age 36, gave him a heating pad for his sore back. He sat in his armchair in the sitting room, which was just off {{of the kitchen and}} the bedroom. While Katie was in her bedroom lying on the bed <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>nightgown,</b> she heard something from the backyard and asked Virgil to turn down the radio. Seconds later, while Virgil was reading the May 3rd edition of the Texarkana Gazette, two shots were fired into {{the back of his head}} from a closed double-window [...] away. Katie did not hear the gunshots; instead, she heard what [...] "sounded like the breaking of glass". She thought Virgil dropped something and went to see what happened. As she entered the doorway to the living room, she saw Virgil standing up and then suddenly slump back into his chair. She saw blood then ran to him and lifted up his head. When she realized he was dead, she ran to the phone to call police.|$|E
6000|$|RAINA (her eyes dilating). Ah! (She {{throws the}} cloak on the ottoman, and comes eagerly to Catherine <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>nightgown,</b> a pretty garment, but evidently {{the only one}} she has on.) ...|$|E
60|$|She {{looked so}} pitiful and {{pleading}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> white <b>nightgown</b> against the shadowy lumber-hole {{that he was}} quite worried. She continued to beseech him not to disturb her.|$|R
60|$|She rushed, passionately, {{through the}} open door into the moonlight. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> bare feet, clad only <b>in</b> <b>her</b> flowing <b>nightgown,</b> she stood like a spirit among the dark vines and lacy shadows of the old veranda.|$|R
60|$|The door clicked and opened: Olive entered <b>in</b> <b>her</b> {{long white}} <b>nightgown.</b> She {{hurried to the}} bed.|$|R
60|$|The full July moon, {{streaming}} {{through the}} open door, discovered touchingly the hopeless misery of Mariposilla. She was <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>nightgown,</b> gazing piteously into the illuminated face of the unsympathetic doll above the chimney shelf.|$|E
60|$|As he roars it Amy peeps in anxiously. She is <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>nightgown,</b> and {{her hair}} is down and her feet are bare, and she does not look so very much more than five. Alice is unable to resist the temptation.|$|E
60|$|At length that Princess {{was brought}} out <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>nightgown,</b> {{with all her}} {{beautiful}} hair falling down her back, and looking so pretty that even the beef-eaters and keepers of the wild animals wept plentifully at seeing her. And she walked with her poor little feet (only luckily the arena was covered with sawdust), and went and leaned up against a great stone in {{the centre of the}} amphitheatre, round which the Court and the people were seated in boxes, with bars before them, for fear of the great, fierce, red-maned, black-throated, long-tailed, roaring, bellowing, rushing lions.|$|E
6000|$|MABEL and RONALD DANCY enter. She is {{a pretty}} young woman with [...] bobbed hair, fortunately, for she has {{just got out of}} bed, and is <b>in</b> [...] <b>her</b> <b>nightgown</b> and a wrapper. DANCY is in his smoking jacket. He [...] has a pale, {{determined}} face with high cheekbones, small, deep-set [...] dark eyes, reddish crisp hair, and looks like a horseman.|$|R
6000|$|<b>In</b> <b>her</b> batiste <b>nightgown</b> she was {{standing}} at the bureau engaged in the invariable rites of wishing that she had a real dressing-table with a triple mirror, of bending toward the streaky glass and raising her chin to inspect a pin-head mole on her throat, and finally of brushing <b>her</b> hair. <b>In</b> rhythm to the strokes she went on: ...|$|R
50|$|Like many American {{films of}} the time, All Aboard was subject to cuts by city and state film {{censorship}} boards. For example, the Chicago Board of Censors required the cut of the scene with the woman rolling on the man and of the woman <b>in</b> hallway with <b>her</b> <b>nightgown</b> raised, exposing <b>her</b> legs.|$|R
60|$|When the {{carriage}} stopped, {{the three women}} sprang out at once, and how they all got through the door, I cannot tell. There was such a tremendous ring at {{the gate of the}} court that the old concierge, who opened it by pulling a wire in his little den somewhere in the rear, must have been dreadfully startled in his sleep. We rushed through the court and up the stairs past our apartments to Pomona's room; and there in the open doorway stood Jonas, his coat off, his sandy hair in wild confusion, his face radiant, and in his hands Little Kensington <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>nightgown.</b>|$|E
60|$|It {{was nearly}} ten when he bade her go to bed. And {{after she had}} gone obedient into the bedroom, he brought ink and paper down by the fire. The drifter, the unstable, the good-for-nothing--did not falter. He had thought, {{when it came to}} the point, he would fail himself; but a sort of rage bore him forward. If he lived on, and confessed, they would shut him up, take from him the one thing he loved, cut him off from her; sand up his only well in the desert. Curse them! And he wrote by firelight which mellowed the white sheets of paper; while, against the dark curtain, the girl, <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>nightgown,</b> {{unconscious}} of the cold, stood watching.|$|E
6000|$|... "They've hoofed out the prostitute. One {{night while}} we were away that old numskull Thornbury was doddering about the {{passages}} very late. (Nobody seems to have {{asked him what he}} was up to.) He saw the Signora Lola Mendoza, as she calls herself, cross the passage <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>nightgown.</b> He communicated his suspicions next morning to Elliot, with the result that Rodriguez went to the woman and gave her twenty-four hours in which to clear out of the place. No one seems to have enquired into the truth of the story, or to have asked Thornbury and Elliot what business it was of theirs; they had it entirely their own way. I propose that we should all sign a Round Robin, go to Rodriguez in a body, and insist upon a full enquiry. Something's got to be done, don't you agree?" ...|$|E
50|$|He {{took out}} a £1000 life {{insurance}} policy against the accidental death of his Mrs Chantrelle in August 1877. She was found unconscious {{on the morning of}} 2 January 1878 and later died in hospital. He was arrested after her funeral on 5 January 1878 when traces of opium were found <b>in</b> vomit on <b>her</b> <b>nightgown.</b>|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Vivian's money {{runs out}} and Michael owes $2,000 to gangster Ace (Edward Arnold), who {{tells him to}} pay up or else. Desperate, Michael tries to {{blackmail}} Robert by threatening to inform the press about Mary's criminal background. When that does not work, he kidnaps Robert's boy. However, Vivian scrawls a message <b>in</b> lipstick on <b>her</b> <b>nightgown</b> and throws herself {{out the window of}} the fourth-floor apartment where she and her son are being held, leading to the child's rescue.|$|R
50|$|Remi and Bigmama {{set sail}} for England on a cargo liner. On the first morning, Remi leaves her cabin and explores the ship, clad <b>in</b> nothing but <b>her</b> <b>nightgown.</b> She is {{discovered}} by Miss Smith, who drags {{her back to}} Bigmama, offering to tutor Remi during the voyage. Remi feigns illness to escape Miss Smith, sneaks out of her cabin, and stumbles into the crew quarters, where she meets Mr Lowther. She spends {{most of the remaining}} voyage with Lowther, learning about the ship and listening to the crew’s stories.|$|R
6000|$|At length that Princess {{was brought}} out <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>nightgown,</b> {{with all her}} {{beautiful}} hair falling down her back, and looking so pretty that even the beef-eaters and keepers of the wild animals wept plentifully at seeing her.

And now the gates were opened, and with a wurrawarrurawarar two great lean, hungry, roaring lions rushed out of their den, where they had been kept for three weeks on nothing but a little toast-and-water, and dashed straight up to the stone where poor Rosalba was waiting. Commend her to your patron saints, all you kind people, for she is in a dreadful state! ...|$|E
60|$|Next {{morning she}} was waked up by hearing Mrs. Gleason pour milk into the trough. She lay very still till {{the woman was}} gone; then she crept out and drank all she wanted, and took the best bits of cold potato and bread for her breakfast, and the lazy pigs did not get up till she was done. While they ate and rooted in the dirt, Betty slept {{as long as she}} liked, with no school, no errands, no {{patchwork}} to do. She liked it, and kept hidden till night; then she went home, and opened the little window in the store closet, and got in and took as many good things to eat and carry away as she liked. She had a fine walk <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>nightgown,</b> and saw the flowers asleep, heard the little birds chirp in the nest, and watched the fireflies and moths at their pretty play. No one saw her but the cats; and they played with her, and hopped at her toes, in the moonlight, and had great fun.|$|E
60|$|The autumn {{season was}} in full swing. Tristan was {{twitching}} his rug up under his armpits twice a week; Isolde waved her scarf in miraculous sympathy with the conductor's baton. In {{all parts of the}} house were to be found pink faces and glittering breasts. When a Royal hand attached to an invisible body slipped out and withdrew the red and white bouquet reposing on the scarlet ledge, the Queen of England seemed a name worth dying for. Beauty, in its hothouse variety (which is none of the worst), flowered in box after box; and though nothing was said of profound importance, and though it is generally agreed that wit deserted beautiful lips about the time that Walpole died--at any rate when Victoria <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>nightgown</b> descended to meet her ministers, the lips (through an opera glass) remained red, adorable. Bald distinguished men with gold-headed canes strolled down the crimson avenues between the stalls, and only broke from intercourse with the boxes when the lights went down, and the conductor, first bowing to the Queen, next to the bald-headed men, swept round on his feet and raised his wand.|$|E
50|$|Flashbacks in {{the third}} season pick up Maura's family saga from the second season, now {{focusing}} on her somewhat strained childhood in the 1950s. Unable to express herself and perennially untalented at sports, Maura frequently dressed up <b>in</b> <b>her</b> mother's <b>nightgown</b> and jewelry and danced alone in the family bunker. Rose and Yetta were somewhat tolerant, provided Maura confined her activities to the bunker. Things took {{a turn for the}} worse when Haim screamed at <b>her</b> <b>in</b> front of the whole family, revealing how Gittel had been killed in the Holocaust because of her gender identity. Brina shortly thereafter publicly denounced Maura at school, beginning their lifelong feud.|$|R
5000|$|A 250 {{in all but}} name, the 1963 330 America {{shared the}} {{outgoing}} model's chassis but not its engine. Powered by the new 4.0 L engine of the later 330 cars, fifty 330 Americas were built. 185VR15 Pirelli Cinturato tyres (CA67) were original equipment, changed to 205VR15s (CN72) after 1964. A famous 330 America was that of California socialite Sandra Ilene West, who was buried {{at the wheel of}} the car following a 1977 drug overdose. Her instructions specified that she be clad <b>in</b> <b>her</b> lace <b>nightgown</b> with the driver’s seat [...] "slanted at a comfortable angle". Car and driver are interred at the Alamo Masonic Cemetery, San Antonio, Texas.|$|R
6000|$|... "How old is he?" [...] Dolly asked, innocently enough, {{standing}} {{up by the}} bedside <b>in</b> <b>her</b> dainty white <b>nightgown.</b> But Winnie caught at her meaning with the preternatural sharpness of the girl brought up in immediate contact with the landed interest. [...] "Oh, he's of age," [...] she answered quickly, with a knowing nod. [...] "He's come into the property; he has nobody on earth but himself to consult about his domestic arrangements." ...|$|R
60|$|Exactly {{the same}} way. Then she would divide her {{years between the}} little studio in England and Kami's big studio at Vitry-sur-Marne. No, {{she would go to}} another master, who should force her into the success that was her right, if patient toil and desperate {{endeavour}} gave one a right to anything. Dick had told her that he had worked ten years to understand his craft. She had worked ten years, and ten years were nothing. Dick had said that ten years were nothing,--but that was in regard to herself only. He had said--this very man who could not find time to write--that he would wait ten years for her, and that she was bound to come back to him sooner or later. He had said this in the absurd letter about sunstroke and diphtheria; and then he had stopped writing. He was wandering up and down moonlit streets, kissing cooks. She would like to lecture him now,--not <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>nightgown,</b> of course, but properly dressed, severely and from a height. Yet if he was kissing other girls he certainly would not care whether she lecture him or not. He would laugh at her. Very good.|$|E
6000|$|... “It’s {{a beautifully}} simple view,” I said. “I imagine {{you are not}} the only one who holds it; but I really must look after your comforts. You mustn’t forget that we have to see Baron H. early to-morrow morning.” And I went out quietly into the passage {{wondering}} in what part of the house Therese had elected to sleep that night. But, lo and behold, when I got to the foot of the stairs there was Therese coming down from the upper regions <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>nightgown,</b> like a sleep-walker. However, it wasn’t that, because, before I could exclaim, she vanished off the first floor landing like a streak of white mist and without the slightest sound. Her attire made it perfectly clear that she could not have heard us coming in. In fact, she must have been certain that the house was empty, because she was as well aware as myself that the Italian girls after their work at the opera were going to a masked ball to dance for their own amusement, attended of course by their conscientious father. But what thought, need, or sudden impulse had driven Therese out of bed like this was something I couldn’t conceive.|$|E
60|$|The {{penetrating}} {{quality of}} these tones which I {{had not heard}} for so many, many days made my eyes run full of tears. I guessed easily that the appeal was addressed to the atrocious Therese. The speaker was concealed from me by the high back of the sofa, but her apprehension was perfectly justified. For was it not I who had turned back Therese the pious, the insatiable, coming downstairs <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>nightgown</b> to torment her sister some more? Mere surprise at Doña Rita’s presence {{in the house was}} enough to paralyze me; but I was also overcome by an enormous sense of relief, by the assurance of security for her and for myself. I didn’t even ask myself how she came there. It was enough for me that she was not in Tolosa. I could have smiled at the thought that all I had to do now was to hasten the departure of that abominable lunatic—for Tolosa: an easy task, almost no task at all. Yes, I would have smiled, had not I felt outraged by the presence of Señor Ortega under the same roof with Doña Rita. The mere fact was repugnant to me, morally revolting; so that I should have liked to rush at him and throw him out into the street. But that was not to be done for various reasons. One of them was pity. I was suddenly at peace with all mankind, with all nature. I felt as if I couldn’t hurt a fly. The intensity of my emotion sealed my lips. With a fearful joy tugging at my heart I moved round the head of the couch without a word.|$|E
50|$|When d'Artagnan later reveals to Milady {{that the}} tryst {{has been with}} him, not des Wardes, she {{attempts}} to kill him. <b>In</b> the struggle, <b>her</b> <b>nightgown</b> is torn, revealing the old fleur-de-lis brand. Knowing that her terrible secret has been revealed to her enemy, Milady is doubly resolved that d'Artagnan must die. Her attempts to secure his assassination lead to her eventual downfall. D'Artagnan escapes and immediately reports to Athos that Milady has a brand on her shoulder identical to one he discovered on his wife's body. When Athos hears this and identifies the ring Milady gave to d'Artagnan as his mother's, the former Comte de la Fère realizes that his wife is not dead after all.|$|R
60|$|They {{turned the}} clothes back. Paul saw his mother {{like a girl}} curled up <b>in</b> <b>her</b> flannel nightdress. Quickly they made {{one half of the}} bed, moved her, made the other, {{straightened}} <b>her</b> <b>nightgown</b> over <b>her</b> small feet, and covered her up.|$|R
6000|$|Though utterly {{unlike in}} character, the twins got on remarkably well together, and seldom quarreled more than thrice a day. Of course, Demi tyrannized over Daisy, and gallantly defended her from every other aggressor, while Daisy made a galley slave of herself, and adored her brother {{as the one}} perfect being in the world. A rosy, chubby, sunshiny little soul was Daisy, who found her way to everybody's heart, and nestled there. One of the {{captivating}} children, who seem made to be kissed and cuddled, adorned and adored like little goddesses, and produced for general approval on all festive occasions. Her small virtues were so sweet {{that she would have}} been quite angelic if a few small naughtinesses had not kept her delightfully human. It was all fair weather <b>in</b> <b>her</b> world, and every morning she scrambled up to the window <b>in</b> <b>her</b> little <b>nightgown</b> to look out, and say, no matter whether it rained or shone, [...] "Oh, pitty day, oh, pitty day!" [...] Everyone was a friend, and she offered kisses to a stranger so confidingly that the most inveterate bachelor relented, and baby-lovers became faithful worshipers.|$|R
6000|$|He only {{stood there}} perhaps twenty seconds, but visual records gleaned {{in a moment}} {{sometimes}} outlast the visions of hours and days. The electric light was not burning; but, in {{the centre of the}} room the girl was kneeling <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>nightgown</b> before a little table on which were four lighted candles. Her arms were crossed on her breast; the candle-light shone on her fair cropped hair, on the profile of cheek and chin, on her bowed white neck. For a moment he thought her alone; then behind her saw his brother in a sleeping suit, leaning against the wall, with arms crossed, watching. It was {{the expression on his face}} which burned the whole thing in, so that always afterwards he was able to see that little scene--such an expression as could never have been on the face of one even faintly conscious that he was watched by any living thing on earth. The whole of Larry's heart and feeling seemed to have come up out of him. Yearning, mockery, love, despair! The depth of his feeling for this girl, his stress of mind, fears, hopes; the flotsam good and evil of his soul, all transfigured there, exposed and unforgettable. The candle-light shone upward on to his face, twisted by the strangest smile; his eyes, darker and more wistful than mortal eyes should be, seemed to beseech and mock the white-clad girl, who, all unconscious, knelt without movement, like a carved figure of devotion. The words seemed coming from his lips: [...] "Pray for us! Bravo! Yes! Pray for us!" [...] And suddenly Keith saw her stretch out her arms, and lift her face with a look of ecstasy, and Laurence starting forward. What had she seen beyond the candle flames? It is the unexpected which invests visions with poignancy. Nothing more strange could Keith have seen in this nest of the murky and illicit. But in sheer panic lest he might be caught thus spying he drew back and hurried on. So Larry was living there with her! When the moment came he could still find him.|$|E

50|$|Fifteen-year-old Tina Gray is stalked {{through a}} boiler room and {{attacked}} by a disfigured man wearing a blade-fixed glove. She awakens from the nightmare, but her mother points out four mysterious slashes <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>nightgown.</b>|$|E

60|$|Her fingers {{dropped from}} the {{frilling}} of <b>her</b> <b>nightgown,</b> and <b>her</b> fierce black eyes flashed at me.|$|R
60|$|Her figure looked {{singularly}} {{tall and}} imposing {{as she stood}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> long white <b>nightgown,</b> a thick cable of twisted dark hair hanging straight down {{her back to her}} waist. The kindly dimness of the weak candle abstracted from her form and features the little blemishes which sunlight might have revealed--the stubble scratches upon her wrists, and the weariness of her eyes--her high enthusiasm having a transfiguring effect upon the face which had been her undoing, showing it as a thing of immaculate beauty, with a touch of dignity which was almost regal. The little ones kneeling round, their sleepy eyes blinking and red, awaited her preparations full of a suspended wonder which their physical heaviness at that hour would not allow to become active.|$|R
