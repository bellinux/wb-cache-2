5|$|The Jawaharlal Nehru Port, which {{currently}} handles 55–60% of India's containerised cargo, was commissioned on 26 May 1989 across the creek at Nhava Sheva {{with a view}} to de-congest Bombay Harbour and to serve as a <b>hub</b> <b>port</b> for the city. The geographical limits of Greater Bombay were coextensive with municipal limits of Greater Bombay. On 1 October 1990, the Greater Bombay district was bifurcated to form two revenue districts namely, Bombay City and Bombay Suburban, though they continued to be administered by same Municipal Administration.|$|E
5|$|Nehru Centre was {{established}} in 1972 at Worli in Bombay. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) was set up on 26 January 1975 by the Government of Maharashtra as an apex body for planning and co-ordination of development activities in the Mumbai metropolitan region. Nehru Science Centre, India's largest interactive science centre, {{was established}} in 1972 at Worli in Bombay. In August 1979, a sister township of Navi Mumbai was founded by City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) across Thane and Raigad districts of Maharashtra to help the dispersal and control of Mumbai's population. The Great Bombay Textile Strike was called on 18 January 1982 by trade union leader Dutta Samant, where nearly 250,000 workers and more than 50 textile mills in Bombay went on strike. On 17 May 1984, riots broke out in Bombay, Thane, and Bhiwandi after a saffron flag was placed {{at the top of}} a mosque. 278 were killed and 1,118 were wounded. The Jawaharlal Nehru Port was commissioned on 26 May 1989 at Nhava Sheva with a view to de-congest Bombay Harbour and to serve as a <b>hub</b> <b>port</b> for the city. In December 1992 – January 93, over 1,000 people were killed and the city paralyzed by communal riots between the Hindus and the Muslims caused by the destruction of the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya. A series of 13 co-ordinated bomb explosions took place in Bombay on 12 March 1993, which resulted in 257 deaths and 700 injuries. The attacks were believed to be orchestrated by mafia don Dawood Ibrahim in retaliation for the Babri Mosque demolition. In 1996, the newly elected Shiv Sena-led government renamed the city of Bombay to the native name Mumbai, after the Koli native Marathi people Goddess Mumbadevi. Soon colonial British names were shed to assert or reassert local names, such as Victoria Terminus being renamed to Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus on 4 March 1996, after the 17th century Marathi King Shivaji.|$|E
25|$|Chennai Port, {{formerly}} known as Madras Port, is the second largest container port of India, behind the Nhava Sheva Port, and the largest port in the Bay of Bengal. It is the third oldest port among the 13 major ports of India with official port operations beginning in 1881, although maritime trade started much earlier in 1639 on the undeveloped shore. It is an artificial and all-weather port with wet docks. Once a major travel port, it become a major container port in the post-Independence era. The port remains a primary reason for the economic growth of Tamil Nadu, especially for the manufacturing boom in South India, and has contributed greatly {{to the development of}} the city. It is due of the existence of the port that the city of Chennai eventually became known as the Gateway of South India. The port has become a <b>hub</b> <b>port</b> for containers, cars and project cargo in the east coast of India. From handling a meagre volume of cargo in the early years of its existence, consisting chiefly of imports of oil and motors and the export of groundnuts, granite and ores, the port has started handling more than 60 million tonnes of cargo in recent years. In 2008, the port's container traffic crossed 1 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs). It is currently ranked the 86th largest container port in the world and there are plans to expand the capacity to about 140 million tonnes per annum. It is an ISO 14001:2004 and ISPS-certified port and has become a main line port having direct connectivity to more than 50 ports around the world.|$|E
30|$|Here, both {{market and}} {{geographical}} factors are discussed. First, {{the role of}} the <b>hub</b> <b>port’s</b> location as both a production and consumption center is significant to ensure the balance of trade movements (import/export) and realize low container reposition costs. Moreover, the number of connected markets and the presence of <b>hub</b> <b>ports</b> in multiple supply/value chains are both significant since main <b>hub</b> <b>ports,</b> such as Singapore, have a competitive advantage due to their attractive connected markets. As geographical influences, overlapping origin and/or destination markets could be served simultaneously by multiple <b>hub</b> <b>ports.</b> Therefore, the locations of the origin/destination markets are highlighted considering the high voyage costs.|$|R

30|$|All <b>hub</b> <b>ports</b> have {{advantages}} {{in terms of}} time and location categories, which are the main influencers of the PPI, whereas the PPIs of Singapore and Tanjung Pelepas for relay networks are highly influenced by the location category, which could be due to the absence of feeder-link-related criteria. The liner-related category has the least influence on the PPI for all <b>hub</b> <b>ports</b> in both networks. Furthermore, the comparatively lower performances in the liner-related and time categories may contribute to the low PPIs of both Kelang and Tanjung Pelepas in the relay case. The influences of both the port traffic and operation categories are nearly the same for all <b>hub</b> <b>ports,</b> although Singapore has a slightly higher contribution from the operation category.|$|R

40|$|Container {{ports in}} the Mediterranean region can be {{classified}} into two main categories, i. e. <b>hub</b> <b>ports</b> and gateway ports This paper, after a brief comparison about the amount and the typology of maritime trade of Italian ports during the recent years, focuses on Italian deep sea container services and their integration with short sea container routes. In particular, a detailed overview has been performed about the deep sea container lines crossing: the ports forming the North Tyrrhenian gateway cluster, i. e.

30|$|The {{reviewed}} literature {{reveals the}} various criteria from previous studies, and the findings differ based on decision maker perspectives. However, criteria such as cost and location are highlighted by most existing studies. Recent studies (i.e., Zarei (2015) and Wu and Peng (2013)) consider a different range of criteria, including qualitative factors, rather than confining their scopes primarily to cost. The majority of studies {{focus on the}} competitiveness of neighboring <b>hub</b> <b>ports</b> while analyzing competition in general despite the various liner network types. There are few studies on <b>hub</b> <b>ports</b> and feeder markets related to South Asia, and this visible knowledge {{gap in the literature}} emphasizes the significance of the current study.|$|R
30|$|According to the interviews, {{a cascade}} effect {{characterized}} by the replacement of small vessels with large container carriers creates complexity, as shipping lines attempt to maintain limited ports of call due to high vessel operating costs and port infrastructure limitations. As such, both market-oriented and operational-oriented approaches in liner service design were discussed. As examples, shipping lines currently maintain multiple <b>hub</b> <b>ports</b> simultaneously to expand market coverage, thus incorporating the market-oriented approach. On the other hand, some major shipping lines relocate their transshipment hubs from existing major <b>hub</b> <b>ports</b> to newly developed ports due to advantages such as low cost and congestion free operations, as per the operational-oriented approach.|$|R

30|$|According to the {{performance}} evaluations of <b>hub</b> <b>ports</b> around the Bay of Bengal, the dominant performance of Singapore was highlighted for most criteria, whereas {{the performance}}s of the other <b>hub</b> <b>ports</b> varied by criteria. Tanjung Pelepas had the lowest performance for most criteria, and Colombo and Kelang also had the lowest performances on few criteria. Therefore, recommendations could be made for each port to enhance competitiveness. This study has its limitations. Although respondents at senior management levels from relevant divisions of shipping lines were selected to ensure representativeness, methods other than surveys can be considered, to avoid the influence of respondents’ subjectivity. As further research, new criteria can be added considering the developed contextualized framework (e.g., macro level factors), and non-significant criteria can be excluded.|$|R
5000|$|The EHCI {{utilizes}} OHCI or UHCI controllers as [...] "companion controllers", where USB 2 {{devices are}} managed through the EHCI stack, and the port {{logic of the}} EHCI allows a low-speed or full-speed USB device to be routed to a port of a [...] "companion" [...] UHCI or OHCI controller, where the low-speed or full-speed USB devices are managed through the respective UHCI or OHCI stack. For example, a USB 2 PCIe host controller card that presents 4 USB [...] "Standard A" [...] connectors typically presents one 4-port EHCI and two 2-port OHCI controllers to system software. When a high-speed USB device is attached {{to any of the}} 4 connectors, the device is managed through one of the 4 root <b>hub</b> <b>ports</b> of the EHCI controller. If a low-speed or full-speed USB device is attached to connectors 1 or 2, it will be routed to the root <b>hub</b> <b>ports</b> of one of the OHCI controllers for management, and low-speed and full-speed USB devices attached to connectors 3 or 4 will be routed to the root <b>hub</b> <b>ports</b> of the other OHCI controller.

30|$|Due {{to their}} {{location}} characteristics and operational performances, four <b>hub</b> <b>ports,</b> namely, Colombo in South Asia and Singapore, Kelang, and Tanjung Pelepas in Southeast Asia, {{compete in the}} feeder market related to the Bay of Bengal, which is not directly served by mainline vessels in hub and spoke networks. Moreover, due to their {{close proximity to the}} East-West trunk sea route, these four <b>hub</b> <b>ports</b> compete with each other to be selected as the transshipment hub for relay networks. The consideration of two liner networks is important, as shipping lines take this aspect into account when determining the movement of containers. As an example, if one vessel has containers destined to Tuticorin feeder port as well as containers being transshipped to another mainline vessel, and if this first vessel calls at both Colombo and Singapore, the container destined to Tuticorin port would be transshipped at Colombo because of the lower feeder cost, whereas the container being transshipped to another mainline vessel would be transshipped at Singapore because the connecting mainline vessel also calls at Singapore port. We assume that these aspects create distinct roles for transshipment hubs in hub and spoke or relay networks.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} several years, port related charges in Japanese ports have been {{substantially}} higher than those charged in other major international <b>hub</b> <b>ports.</b> All major container ports in Japan feature so-called Dedicated Terminals in which cost-effectiveness is justified by huge container volume to be handled. One of the reasons cited for high port charges is a relative decrease in handling volume compared to the terminal capacity, resulting in inefficient use of the existing capacity. The use of the Multi-User Container Terminal (MUT) concept employed {{in some of the}} major container <b>hub</b> <b>ports</b> such as Hong Kong, Pusan, Hamburg and Rotterdam reduces redundant terminal space and results in substantial cost savings in cargo handling costs and therefore is desired for ports in Japan as well. One of the key issues in the MUT operation is the berth allocation to calling vessels. In a recent study, an allocation problem for the MUT was examined, in which each vessel was treated equally. However, as some vessel operators desire high priority services, the goal {{of this paper is to}} modify the existing formulation of the berth allocation problem in order to treat calling vessels at various service priorities by developing a genetic algorithm based heuristic for the resulting non-linear problem. ...|$|R

Ports around Bohai Bay and the port group in the Yangtze River Delta were the most competitive areas in terms of outbound and inbound structure, respectively. The major contributors to port similarity in different regions varied geographically due to the different market demands and cargo supplies. For adjacent ports, the functional convergence of inbound structure was more serious than the outbound. The convergence between <b>hub</b> <b>ports</b> was more serious than between adjacent ports in terms of both outbound and inbound structure. The average similarity coefficients displayed an increasing trend over time.
