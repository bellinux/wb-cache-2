40|$|Background : Patients {{with type}} 2 {{diabetes}} have increased levels of oxidative stress and inflammation. A high <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake may be beneficial. Objective : To study whether <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake <b>and</b> levels of plasma antioxidants relate to markers of oxidative stress and inflammation {{in a group of}} patients with {{type 2 diabetes}}. Further, to investigate whether plasma antioxidants are good biomarkers for intake of <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables.</b> Design : Patients with type 2 diabetes were studied. Their dietary intake and levels of plasma antioxidants, and markers of oxidative stress and inflammation were analysed. Results : <b>Fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake was inversely related to oxidative stress. Plasma carotenoids were negatively correlated with inflammation.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess personal, social and environmental factors regarding <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake among 11 - to 12 -year-old children in Europe. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was undertaken, with nationally or regionally representative samples of in total 13, 305 children (mean age 11. 4 years) from nine European countries. Pupils in the classroom completed a self-administered questionnaire measuring <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake <b>and</b> personal, social and environmental factors during one school lesson. Age-adjusted covariance analyses were carried out by gender, for the full sample and for each country separately. Proportions responding positively to the constructs are presented. RESULTS: Overall, European children held a positive attitude towards <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake. For some constructs, large between-country differences were found. Children had a more positive attitude towards <b>fruit</b> than towards <b>vegetables,</b> <b>and</b> girls were on average more positive than boys.

The transfer of potassium ions through nerve cell membranes is necessary for normal nerve transmission; potassium deficiency and excess can each result in numerous abnormalities, including an abnormal heart rhythm and various electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities. Fresh <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> are good dietary sources of potassium. The body responds to the influx of dietary potassium, which raises serum potassium levels, with a shift of potassium from outside to inside cells {{and an increase in}} potassium excretion by the kidneys.|$|E

Sweetness {{is the main}} theme and the Rosh Hashana dinners typically begin with apples dipped in honey, and end with honey cake. The challah is usually round, often studded with raisins and drizzled with honey, and other symbolic <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> are eaten as an entree, such as pomegranates, carrots, leeks and beets. Fish dishes, symbolizing abundance, are served; for example, gefilte fish is traditional for Ashkenazim, while Moroccan Jews prepare the spicy fish dish, chraime. Honey cake (lekach) is often served as dessert, accompanied by tea or coffee.|$|E

Programs established by the New Deal and efforts by Florida governors in mid and late 1930s, particularly David Sholtz, brought relief to the economic slump, but the region remained in an abysmal financial state until the onslaught of American involvement in World War II.|$|E

40|$|Summary Background A high {{intake of}} <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> is {{important}} {{as an essential}} part of a healthy lifestyle. Although differences in <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake have been observed between the European countries, large proportions of the population, including children and adolescents, have a low consumption compared with the recommendations. It is important to promote a high intake of <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> in childhood as dietary habits acquired in early life may have a great impact on long-term health status. In order to increase the intake of <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> among children, insight into important and changeable correlates of <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption is needed. The Pro Children cross-sectional survey was designed to gather information about the actual consumption and potential correlates of <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption among 11 - to 13 -year-old children and their parents in the participating European countries. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the intake of <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> among Portuguese children and their mothers. Proportion of children reporting positively to personal, social and physical environmental factors regarding <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption, together with assessment of potential correlates of daily <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake were also studied. Focus was made on gender and regional differences (Norte, Centro, Lisboa e vale de Tejo, Alentejo and Algarve) in the consumption and the associated factors within Portugal. Method For this thesis data from the Pro Children cross-sectional study in Portugal was used. Portugal had the largest sample size of the nine participating countries with 2535 eligible students from 27 schools and their respective parents. A precoded self-administered questionnaire was developed to assess <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake as well as possible factors associated with these consumption patterns among children, as well as among one of their parents. <b>Fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake was assessed with a 24 -hour recall and food frequency questions. The potential correlates included were divided into demographic, personal, perceived social environmental and perceived physical-environmental factors, and were assessed with separate questions. Data from 2134 children and 1314 mothers were included in the analyses. Results The consumption of <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> was low among the children, both amount (mean fruit intake = 153 grams <b>and</b> mean <b>vegetables</b> intake = 111 grams) and frequency of intake (daily fruit intake = 56. 5 % <b>and</b> daily <b>vegetable</b> intake = 50. 1 %). Both gender and regional differences were found. Girls had a more frequent consumption of both <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> compared with boys, and Lisboa and Algarve were the two regions where children reported the lowest consumption of <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> respectively. The proportion of children consuming 400 grams per day, as recommended by WHO, the day prior to the survey was only 21. 4 %. The consumption of <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> was also low among the mothers, and only 44. 0 % of the mothers reported to reach the WHO recommendations. Children were in general positive towards factors regarding <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake. Gender <b>and</b> regional differences were found, with more girls reporting positively to the personal and social environmental factors regarding <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> compared with boys. In addition, nearly all children perceived the <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> availability at home to be good. The personal factors, i. e. knowledge, liking and preferences, were found to be significantly associated with daily intake of <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables,</b> as well as two social environmental factors: modelling and demand family rule. In addition, mothers’ intake of fruit was associated with daily fruit intake among their offspring. Gender and regional differences were also found for the factors associated with daily <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake. Conclusion The <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake among Portuguese children as well as their mothers, although high in the European setting, is low compared with the recommendations. However children are positive toward factors regarding <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption. Gender <b>and</b> regional differences were found both for consumption of <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables,</b> <b>and</b> for the associated factors. It is important to increase the consumption, especially of <b>vegetables,</b> <b>and</b> personal and social environmental factors together with mother’s intake were found to be important correlates...|$|R
