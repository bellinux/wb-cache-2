5|$|Elizabeth Bear's Carnival (2006) revisits the trope of the single-gender world, {{as a pair}} of {{gay male}} ambassador-spies attempt to {{infiltrate}} and subvert the predominately lesbian civilization of New Amazonia, whose matriarchal rulers <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> enslaved their men. In 2007, J.K. Rowling's statement that Albus Dumbledore, a character in her Harry Potter series, was gay caused some controversy. Sarah Hall's dystopian novel The Carhullan Army (2007), published in the US under the title Daughters of the North, matter of factly features lesbians as primary characters. The novel won the 2007 John Llewellyn Rhys Prize and James Tiptree, Jr. Award, and was shortlisted for the 2008 Arthur C. Clarke Award. It is perhaps telling of the evolution of public perception of same sex relationships that the relationships are unmentioned or only peripherally noted in reviews.|$|E
5|$|Today, the {{international}} border is firmly established and peaceful; {{there is a}} greater sense of Canadian nationality, and fears of U.S. Manifest Destiny <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> disappeared. Canada and the U.S. have formalized their trading partnership with the North American Free Trade Agreement, leading to increased trade between the two nations. This trade now coursing up and down the valleys of the Red and Mississippi rivers more than fulfils Lord Selkirk's predictions made nearly two centuries ago; while he first sought access over U.S. territory for the succour of his nascent colony, now commerce in manufactures and commodities goes in both directions. The trade corridor once occupied by the long-gone Red River Trails continues to be employed for its historic purposes.|$|E
5|$|Until recently, {{red deer}} and elk were {{considered}} to be one species, Cervus elaphus. However, mitochondrial DNA studies, conducted on hundreds of samples in 2004 from red deer and elk subspecies as well as other species of the Cervus deer family, strongly indicate that elk, or wapiti, should be a distinct species, namely Cervus canadensis. The previous classification had over a dozen subspecies under the C. elaphus species designation; DNA evidence concludes that elk are more closely related to Thorold's deer and even sika deer than they are to the red deer. Though elk and red deer can produce fertile offspring in captivity, geographic isolation between the species in the wild and differences in mating behaviors indicate that reproduction between them outside a controlled environment would be unlikely. However, the two species have freely inter-bred in New Zealand's Fiordland National Park, where the cross-bred animals <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> removed the pure elk blood from the area.|$|E

25|$|To be on {{the safe}} side, a pill-activated {{inflation}} device is preferred. A small pill that dissolves on water contact is the safest option, as it also works in shallow waters where a hydrostatic activator fails. This type of jacket is called an 'automatic'. As it is more sensitive to the presence of water, early models could also be activated by very heavy rain or spray. For this reason, spare re-arming kits should be carried on board for each life jacket. However, with modern cup/bobbin mechanisms this problem rarely arises and mechanisms such as the Halkey Roberts Pro firing system <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> eliminated accidental firing.|$|E
25|$|The most commons {{species of}} fish in the river are Coregonus lavaretus, European perch and {{northern}} pike, all three which have been the basis for sustenance fishing.

Uncommon fish species include European river lamprey, three-spined stickleback, nine-spined stickleback and common minnow.

Both steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and King salmon are extant in the Guadalupe River, making San Jose the southernmost major U. S. city with known salmon spawning runs, the other cities being Anchorage, Alaska; Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon and Sacramento, California. Runs of up to 1,000 Chinook or King Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) swam up the Guadalupe River each fall in the 1990s, but <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> vanished in the current decade apparently blocked from access to breeding grounds by impassable culverts, weirs and wide, exposed and flat concrete paved channels installed by the Santa Clara Valley Water District.

25|$|In 1883, a {{group of}} {{railroad}} surveyors headed by S. L. Dolson and David Loring arrived in Rock Point, near present-day Gold Hill. They were charged with finding the best route through the Rogue Valley for the Oregon and California Railroad. Citizens of neighboring Jacksonville hoped that it would pass between their town and Hanley Butte, near the present day Claire Hanley Arboretum. Such a move would <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> guaranteed prosperous growth for Jacksonville, but Dolson decided instead to stake the railroad closer to Bear Creek. The response from Jacksonville was mixed, but the decision was final. By November 1883, a depot site had been chosen and a surveying team led by Charles J. Howard was hard at work platting the new town. They completed their work in early December 1883, laying out 82 blocks for development.|$|E
25|$|Diving helmet squeeze: Helmet squeeze {{will occur}} if the gas supply hose is severed above the diver and the {{non-return}} valve at the helmet gas inlet fails {{or is not}} fitted. Severity {{will depend on the}} hydrostatic pressure difference. A very rapid descent, usually by accident, may exceed {{the rate at which the}} breathing gas supply can equalise the pressure causing a temporary squeeze. The introduction of the non-return valve and high maximum gas supply flow rates <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> eliminated both these risks. In helmets fitted with a neck dam, the dam will admit water into the helmet if the internal pressure gets too low; this is less of a problem than helmet squeeze but the diver may drown if the gas supply is not reinstated quickly. This form of barotrauma is avoidable by controlled descent rate, which is standard practice for commercial divers, who will use shotlines, diving stages and wet bells to control descent and ascent rates.|$|E

500|$|Jenny Sawyer {{wrote in}} Christian Science Monitor on 25 July 2007 that the books {{represent}} a [...] "disturbing trend in commercial storytelling and Western society" [...] in that stories [...] "moral center [...] <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> vanished from much of today's pop culture... after 10 years, 4,195 pages, and over 375 million copies, J.

Harry Potter, Sawyer argues, neither faces a [...] "moral struggle" [...] nor undergoes any ethical growth, and is thus [...] "no guide in circumstances in which right and wrong are anything less than black and white". In contrast Emily Griesinger described Harry's first passage through to Platform 9¾ as an application of faith and hope, and his encounter with the Sorting Hat as {{the first of many}} in which Harry is shaped by the choices he makes.

Before its official release date on October5, the band played at the Austin City Limits Music Festival and KBCO's World Class Rockfest. The album was also preceded by its first single, [...] "No Phone", which hit number13 on Billboards Modern Rock Tracks chart; the song covered the ubiquitous and privacy-invading use of cell phones, and was described by Jeremy Mahadevan of the New Straits Times as [...] "a traditionally minimalist Cake anthem, with a killer melody and, unique to this album, fairly extensive use of synths". A second single, [...] "Wheels", was also released but failed to chart. Pressure Chief itself hit number17 on the Billboard top200, spending 7 weeks in the charts, and received mixed reviews from critics. Although it was acknowledged as a continuation of their old work, albeit with an increased use of synthesisers, Sam Spies of the Richmond Times-Dispatch noted that [...] "the experiments in style that made Cake fun to listen to <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> disappeared from 'Pressure Chief'...What's left is mostly uninspired, so-called alternative rock", and Graeme Hammond of the Sunday Herald Sun wrote that [...] "the melodies are listless, the album bereft of anything with the verve of Short Skirt/Long Jacket or Comfort Eagle".|$|E
