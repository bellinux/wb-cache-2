5|$|A mile (1.6km) {{north of}} NY417, NY16 reaches a bridge over Olean Creek, a {{tributary}} of the Allegheny. On the other side, it becomes a four-lane road with a divider as it approaches NY17, currently concurrent with I-86 pending the entire expressway's upgrade to Interstate Highway standards. A trumpet interchange provides access to I-86 and NY17 in both directions in the vicinity of Baldwin Heights. But NY16 runs parallel to the freeway and remains a four-lane route, although no longer divided, following the Olean valley. At Hinsdale it finally does cross I-86/NY17. Shortly afterwards, in the hamlet of Maplehurst, NY446, the former route of NY408, comes <b>in</b> <b>from</b> the east and terminates.|$|E
5|$|A {{study in}} 2010 {{concluded}} that {{the main source of}} the mercury is likely worldwide industry, rather than local sources. As water levels rise and fall, mercury accumulation does as well. About 16 percent of the mercury comes <b>in</b> <b>from</b> rivers, and 84 percent comes from the atmosphere in a non-toxic, inorganic form. The non-toxic mercury is converted into toxic methyl mercury by bacteria which thrive in the more saline water of the North arm affected by the causeway.|$|E

The road curves more gently and takes longer straightaways, with lower density of residential and commercial development. Two miles from Pawling, the Appalachian Trail crosses the road next to the line's Appalachian Trail station. The flag stop allows hikers access to the nearby Pawling Nature Preserve.|$|E
5|$|After {{her return}} to Japan, Hōshō was {{transferred}} to the Third Fleet, unofficially assigned to the training fleet (later called the Mobile Force Training Force), and officially assigned in October. She conducted flight training in the Inland Sea for aircraft that flew <b>in</b> <b>from</b> shore bases, since no aircraft were based on board Hōshō. On 15 January 1943, the 50th Air Flotilla was created for carrier aircrew training and both Hōshō and Ryūhō were assigned to the new unit. The two ships provided carrier landing training and served as target ships for torpedo training. In January 1944, Hōshō was reassigned to the 12th Air Fleet, then to the Combined Fleet, but continued to perform the same mission of training fleet carrier pilots in the Inland Sea. In this role, Hōshō shuttled back and forth between Kure and the Western Inland Sea, spending equal amounts of time at each location.|$|E

5|$|All Hallows Church is {{the oldest}} {{existing}} building in Wellingborough and dates from c.1160.

The west tower, crowned with a graceful broach spire rising to , was completed about 1270, after which the chancel was rebuilt and given the east window twenty years later. The church was restored in 1861 by Edmund Francis Law. The 20th-century Church of St Mary was built by Ninian Comper.|$|E

The Dutch were expelled from the city for six hours but reinforcements were brought <b>in</b> <b>from</b> the nearby cities of Ambarawa and Semarang that afternoon. Indonesian fighters retreated at 12:00pm and the Dutch re-entered the city. The Indonesian attack, later known in Indonesia as Serangan Oemoem (new spelling: Serangan Umum '1 March General Offensive'), is commemorated by a large monument in Yogyakarta.

5|$|An {{adaptation}} of the comics was originally envisioned by producer Tonino Cervi. Cervi hired director Seth Holt and began producing the film as an international co-production, with a cast that included Jean Sorel, Elsa Martinelli and Gilbert Roland. After producer Dino De Laurentiis saw the footage that had been shot, he halted production on the film, had a new screenplay developed, and hired a new director and cast. This resulted in Bava directing the film on a much lower budget, with more well-known actors taking smaller roles. Many of {{the cast and crew}} members were brought <b>in</b> <b>from</b> Barbarella, De Laurentiis' other comic book {{adaptation of}} that year.|$|E
