40|$|Sand {{extraction}} from coastal {{sand dunes}} results in significant loss of sand {{from the natural}} system, destruction of dune vegetation and dramatic geo-technical modification. This can place significant limitations on land use. The identification of, and extraction from sand bodies that {{are not part of}} active coastal barriers or dune structures is therefore considered to be a more <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>practice.</b> Sedimentological investigation of several back-barrier estuarine sequences have located several marine sand deposits within the Illawarra region that meet the above criteria. The action of overwash, possibly by tsunami waves in the late Holocene has deposited large volumes of sand from coastal barrier systems into their respective back-barrier environments. Several of these deposits are identified and mapped with detailed data on one of the deposits presented in this paper. These sand deposits are dominated by fine- to medium-grained quartz sand and hence represent a potential resource for construction sand in particular sand for concrete production. Advances in the understanding of late Holocene overwash activity on coastal sediments could assist in the identification of other sand deposits removed from the coastal zone. Such deposits may allow sand mining activities, providing significant resources of fine- to -medium-grained sand for the construction industry and beach nourishment programs under the principles of sound environmental management...|$|E

40|$|Monitoring of {{watersheds}} that {{discharge into}} Lake Erie {{has revealed that}} dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) levels have increased {{over the last decade}} (Baker, 2007). Many of these watersheds have a large agricultural base, suggesting that a portion of the increased DRP is likely attributable to agricultural activities. The objective of this fact sheet is to discuss management practices that can be implemented by producers to minimize the risk of phosphorus loss. Implementation of these practices not only has environmental benefits but economic benefits as well. Producers today are facing higher input costs (including fertilizer), and the more efficiently inputs are managed, the greater the economic return. Any nutrient transported off-farm represents a loss on an investment. Soil Testing The most cost effective and <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>practice</b> a producer can implement is the use of soil analysis. Soil testing allows one to assess a soil’s current nutrient status and decide on appropriate fertilizer rates to maximize crop production. The Ohio State University recommends that a single composite soil sample (consisting of a minimum of 15 individual cores at an 8 -inch depth) represent no more than 20 contiguous, uniform acres. Once soil samples have been collected, they should be thoroughly mixed and submitted to a reputable lab for analysis. After analysis has been completed, one will receive a soil test report that should reveal the soil’s current phosphorus level. The first step in making a phosphorus fertilizer decision is determining whether additional phosphorus is necessary. Ohio State has established critical levels for phosphorus based upon a Bray-Kurtz P 1 extraction (Table 1). If a Mehlich III extractant is used for phosphorus determination, refer to the fact sheet titled “Understanding Soil Tests for Plant-Available Phosphorus ” (searc...|$|E
40|$|Crediting {{soil for}} {{beneficial}} nutrients or eliminating the over-application of such nutrients can save farmers big bucks in fertilizer costs, according to University of Nebraska-Lincoln research. Whether it is crediting {{soil organic matter}} for nitrogen or eliminating the unnecessary use of phosphorus, potassium and sulfur, these and other cost saving tips to help deal with high input costs in crop production {{can be found at}} UNL 2 ̆ 7 s Surviving High Input Costs in Crop Production ([URL] Web page. Here are four money savings suggestions: 1) Credit soil organic matter for nitrogen. The percentage of organic matter in the soil is a factor used by UNL to make recommendations for nitrogen fertilizer in corn and other crops, said Gary Zoubek, UNL Extension educator in York County. Farmers, particularly those with high organic matter in their soils, need to encourage their soil test laboratories or crop consultants {{to take into account the}} nitrogen from soil organic matter when recommending nitrogen for corn and other grain crops. When nitrogen rates are based on a realistic yield goal and credits for soil nitrates, previous legume crops and potential nitrogen release from organic matter, nitrogen fertilizer recommendations are reduced and nitrogen fertilizer is saved. Take this step for an added profit of 18. 75 per acre, said Aaron Nygren, extension educator in Colfax County. That 2 ̆ 7 s based on 28 pounds of nitrogen saved at 67 cents per pound per each additional percent of organic matter in the soil for a field with a yield of 200 bushels. 2) Eliminate unnecessary use of phosphorus, potassium and sulfur. These nutrients are essential and must be adequately supplied to crops if soil levels are limited to ensure optimal yield, said Richard Ferguson, UNL soils specialist. Adding fertilizer containing these nutrients, as well as nitrogen, iron, zinc and occasionally sulfur, is sometimes necessary for optimal yield in Nebraska crops. A soil test is the best way to determine if the availability of these nutrients is low enough to require fertilization. Not applying phosphorus, potassium and sulfur when soil nutrient availability is adequate can save up to 100 per acre. 3) Credit residual soil nitrate-nitrogen. Since the climate across Nebraska ranges from semi-arid to semi-humid, there can be significant residual nitrate-nitrogen in the root zone from the previous year. This nitrogen typically results from unused fertilizer and nitrogen mineralized from soil organic matter, said Gary Hergert, UNL nutrient management specialist at the Panhandle Research and Extension Center at Scottsbluff. It is profitable and an <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>practice</b> to routinely sample soil for residual nitrate-nitrogen and adjust the calculated nitrogen recommendation accordingly. If Nebraska farmers would save, for example, 36 pounds of nitrogen costing 67 -cents per pound, this could save them 24 per acre, Hergert said. 4) Give proper nitrogen credit for legumes in corn and sorghum rotations. UNL and other land-grant university research clearly demonstrates that farmers can safely reduce their nitrogen input for corn following a legume crop, such as soybeans. UNL recommendations for corn following soybean indicate that there can be a credit of 45 pounds of nitrogen per acre for non-sandy soils and 25 pounds of nitrogen per acre for sandy soils unless the previous soybean yield was less than 30 bushels per acre, Nygren said. Nitrogen fertilizer recommendations for corn following alfalfa can be reduced by 90 to 150 pounds on fine textured soils and by 40 to 100 pounds on sandy soils depending on the alfalfa stand. Based on an average credit of 45 pounds of nitrogen after soybeans and 120 pounds of nitrogen after alfalfa at 67 cents per pound of nitrogen, this adds up to a 30. 15 to 80. 40 per acre savings...|$|E
