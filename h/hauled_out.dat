5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of the storm, the National Park Service closed visitor centers and campgrounds along the Outer Banks. For about 12hours, the ferry between Hatteras and Ocracoke was closed. North Carolina Governor Mike Easley put rescue teams and the National Guard on standby. Residents and {{tourists}} were advised to secure loose objects, and to remain indoors. As the storm's effects were expected to be minor, no evacuations were ordered. On Ocracoke Island, boats were <b>hauled</b> <b>out.</b> The threat of the storm forced the cancellation of a fishing tournament at Atlantic Beach, which resulted in effects to the local economy.|$|E
5|$|Levant {{returned}} to Navy service in 1766 {{under the command}} of Captain Basil Keith, and was assigned to patrol and convoy duties on the Navy's Jamaica Station. In August she docked at Deptford to take on crew and supplies, setting sail for the Caribbean on 28 November. Levant held her Jamaica post for three years, but this extensive service in tropical waters left her in poor condition. In 1770 she {{returned to}} Deptford Dockyard where she was decommissioned and <b>hauled</b> <b>out</b> of the water for rebuilding. The work was granted to shipwright John Dudman and took six months from November 1770 to April 1771. Repair and rebuilding expenses were £5,869 with an additional £3,059 for fitting-out, amounting to considerably more than the vessel's original construction cost of £5,423.|$|E

5|$|An apex {{predator}} affects {{prey population}} dynamics and defense tactics (such as camouflage). The polar bear is the apex predator within its range. Several animal species, particularly Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus), routinely scavenge polar bear kills. The relationship between ringed seals and polar bears {{is so close}} that the abundance of ringed seals in some areas appears to regulate the density of polar bears, while polar bear predation in turn regulates density and reproductive success of ringed seals. The evolutionary pressure of polar bear predation on seals probably accounts for some significant differences between Arctic and Antarctic seals. Compared to the Antarctic, {{where there is no}} major surface predator, Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when <b>hauled</b> <b>out</b> on the ice, and rarely defecate on the ice. The fur of Arctic pups is white, presumably to provide camouflage from predators, whereas Antarctic pups all have dark fur.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{moved to}} Atlanta, Georgia {{for the final}} phase. Wenham and his team {{transformed}} a defunct train yard into an abandoned auto plant used by the protagonists as their headquarters. Redesigning the train yard took place over several months. It was required to allow enough space for stunt drivers to drive into the building, {{and it had to}} include an integrated lighting system. The design team removed walls, <b>hauled</b> <b>out</b> old railway cars, suspended rusted car parts and auto-plant car rails, and constructed smaller buildings within the main building to transform the site. With twenty-five pages of script to shoot in a limited time, cinematographer Stephen Windon and his team spent three weeks setting up a series of high-powered, motorized lights in the rafters of the building, that could be controlled remotely to allow lighting to be altered quickly while fully illuminating the set. An exterior scene involving Diesel and Walker attending a car party, involving several high-performance cars, was filmed near the Georgia Dome. The train heist scene was filmed in Rice, California over three weeks.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds {{are also}} {{targeted}} by terrestrial and pagophilic predators. The polar bear is well adapted for hunting Arctic seals and walruses, particularly pups. Bears {{are known to}} use sit-and-wait tactics as well as active stalking and pursuit of prey on ice or water. Other terrestrial predators include cougars, brown hyenas and various species of canids, which mostly target the young. Pinnipeds lessen the chance of predation by gathering in groups. Some species are capable of inflicting damaging wounds on their attackers with their sharp canines—an adult walrus is capable of killing polar bears. When out at sea, northern elephant seals dive {{out of the reach}} of surface-hunting orcas and white sharks. In the Antarctic, which lacks terrestrial predators, pinniped species spend more time on the ice than their Arctic counterparts. Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when <b>hauled</b> <b>out,</b> and rarely defecate on the ice. Ringed seals build dens underneath fast ice for protection.|$|E

25|$|Winema was {{operated}} as an excursion steamer until {{as late as}} {{the summer}} of 1916. Possibly the vessel operated until 1919. In June 1919, Winema was reported to have undergone repairs and to be ready to be placed into service. In 1919 Winema was <b>hauled</b> <b>out</b> of the lake permanently near where the Pelican Bay marina was located in the 1960s. According to one source, Winema was abandoned in 1925.|$|E
25|$|The Hawaiian {{style of}} {{ranching}} originally included capturing wild cattle by driving them into pits dug {{in the forest}} floor.

40|$|A {{sample of}} 52 cods, Gadus morhua, caught {{close to a}} grey seal, Halichoerus grypus, <b>haul</b> <b>out</b> site, {{and a total of}} 652 cods from 18 {{commercial}} catches (average sample size 36 cods) were examined with regard to cod worm infestation. The sampling was carried out from July 1978 to January 1981 in Norwegian coastal waters between 62 ° and 66 ° North. The presence of larval cod worm was recorded in 64 % of the examined fishes, and the average infestation in all 704 fishes was 8. 5 cod-worms per fish. However, the infestation decreased significantly with increasing distances from the <b>haul</b> <b>out</b> sites of grey seals and common seals, Phoca vitulina. The heaviest infestations were recorded in cod from the outern part of in shore waters, and slightly decreasing towards the fjords, fitting well to the observed distribution of seals. A substantial decrease was also recorded with increasing distance (and depth) off shore from the mentioned grey seal <b>haul</b> <b>out</b> site...|$|R
40|$|The Hawaiian {{monk seal}} is an {{endangered}} species with a current population of approximately 1400 animals. Seals are distributed primarily at six sites in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands. The most depleted of these subpopulations occurs at Midway Atoll. Seal numbers declined at Midway by over 90 % from the 1950 s to 1990 s and currently stand at approximately 70 animals. A cooperative agreement between the National Marine Fisheries Service and Hawaii Wildlife Fund in 1997 led {{to the establishment of}} a year-round monk seal monitoring program at Midway Atoll from 1997 – 2000. This project reports results from this year-round study. Data for the study were based primarily on beach censuses that monitored monk seal <b>haul</b> <b>outs</b> at Midway Atoll. Analyses examined (1) changes in <b>haul</b> <b>out</b> patterns by island over time, (2) seasonal patterns in <b>haul</b> <b>outs,</b> (3) the influence of the barrier reef on monk seal beach counts, (4) preferred pupping habitat, and (5) differences between year-round and seasonal data. Results indicate that there was a shift in <b>haul</b> <b>outs</b> between islands {{over the course of the}} study. A strong seasonal pattern in beach counts for immature animals was also identified. The barrier reef was identified as an important <b>haul</b> <b>out</b> area, particularly for immature animals. Preferred pupping sites were identified. Finally, year-round studies were shown to be valuable in the identification of mother/pup pairs and in the development of female reproductive histories. Seasonal and yearround studies performed equally well in determining average annual beach counts. This study may prove important in identifying potential causes of the slow increase in the Midway monk seal subpopulation. It may also suggest possible remedies or management actions to promote or accelerate the recovery of monk seals at Midway Atoll. Recommendations for future research are also discussed...|$|R

5000|$|Harbor {{seals must}} {{spend a great}} deal of time on shore when moulting, which occurs shortly after breeding. This onshore time is {{important}} to the life cycle, and can be disturbed when there is substantial human presence.

Harbor seals are sometimes reluctant to <b>haul</b> <b>out</b> in the presence of humans, so shoreline development and access must be carefully studied in known locations of seal <b>haul</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
