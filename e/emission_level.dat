25|$|Current {{predictions}} {{based on}} the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report 2007 say that Climate Change might impact the countries closer to the equator more seriously than the countries located more in the North or South. Tropical Vietnam {{is assumed to be}} one of the most vulnerable countries in connection with Climate Change. The medium <b>emission</b> <b>level</b> scenario for 2080-2099 predicts a higher annual rainfall which occurs in the already wet months of the year. At the same time, the dry months might become even hotter due to temperature rise and the stress on the crops might increase due to higher evaporation rates and less available water. Like the current climate differs both in time and in space, also the changing climate is predicted to affect rather the North than the South and it might influence rather the winter than the summer months. Beneath rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns, sea level rise is predicted to affect Vietnam as a country with a coastal line of more than 3,000km especially. The loss of land and soils due to flooding and inundation might lead to a loss of 5% of the total land seriously affecting agriculture, industry, human and natural environment. Salt water intrusion and salinisation of soils and irrigation water (either groundwater or surface water of other water bodies) are predicted to cause serious problems in connection with sea level rise as well.|$|E

40|$|The current paper details a {{computer-aided}} {{research of}} the <b>emission</b> <b>levels</b> in two {{areas of the city}} of Sibiu, Romania. The research started from the numbers of motor vehicles passing through key segments of those two areas, located at entry points into the city of Sibiu.

A systematic investigation of the tailpipe-out <b>emission</b> <b>levels</b> for the real-world drive cycle showed that the levels of vehicle speed and acceleration are immaterial if the vehicle operating points remain within the cleaner zone of the engine map.

40|$|Full annular {{versions}} of advanced combustor designs, sized to fit within the CF 6 - 50 engine, were defined, manufactured, and tested at high pressure conditions. Configurations were screened, and significant reductions in CO, HC, and NOx <b>emissions</b> <b>levels</b> were achieved {{with two of}} these advanced combustor design concepts. Emissions and performance data at a typical AST cruise condition were also obtained along with combustor noise data {{as a part of}} an addendum to the basic program.
