25|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of The French Laundry, Thomas Keller started a small olive oil company called EVO, Inc. in 1992, with his girlfriend of the time, to {{distribute}} Provençal-style olive oil and red wine vinegar. Recently, Keller started marketing a line of signature white Limoges porcelain dinnerware by Raynaud called Hommage Point (in homage to French chef and restaurateur, Fernand Point) that he helped design and a collection of silver <b>hollow</b> <b>ware</b> by Christofle. He has also attached his name to a set of signature knives manufactured by MAC.|$|E
25|$|An {{improved}} European {{situation and}} mild economic recession in 1796–1797 {{did not bring}} the expected wealth to the Gallatin partnership. As Gallatin struggled with the Federalists in the Congress, his partners happened upon six German glassblowers traveling to Kentucky. Convinced that glass would revive their sagging investment, the partners asked the Germans {{to set up shop}} in New Geneva. Gallatin was appalled with the idea, and considered it to be a gamble. Nonetheless, production of glass began on January 18, 1798. Window glass, whiskey bottles, and other <b>hollow</b> <b>ware</b> were produced. This was the first glass blown west of the Alleghenies.|$|E
25|$|In 1913, five {{additional}} wage boards {{were set}} up that covered <b>hollow</b> <b>ware</b> making, shirt making, sugar confectionery and food preserving, tin box making, and linen and cotton embroidery, along with {{a portion of the}} laundry industry. These extensions led to an additional 140,000 being covered by minimum wage legislation. The Public Health (Prevention and Treatment of Disease) Act 1913 empowered local authorities to formulate tuberculosis schemes, while a Trade Union passed that same year clarified the legal position of trade unions while also restoring their political power, together with the financial position of the Labour Party. In 1914, Local Authorities received grants from the government to provide maternal and child welfare services. while the Criminal Justice Administration Act passed that same year compelled magistrates to allow for sufficient time to be made for paying fines. As noted by the historian C. P. Hill, this legislation was both merciful and economical, as it helped to reduce the prison population. The budget of 1914 brought greater progressivity into the taxation system by increasing levels of direct taxation on the wealthy while also investing more money in social services. The educational grant was increased, with money allocated towards the training of specialist teachers, schools for the deformed, grants for open-air schools for victims of tuberculosis, and further state provision for school-meal services. In addition, new provisions for maternity centres, sanitoria, and ancillary health services under the 1911 insurance bill were introduced, together with £4million in loans for local authority house-building.|$|E
5000|$|Lord Vishnu's {{earrings}} {{are shown}} {{in the form of}} Makara; but makarakundala can also decorate Shiva's ears. Its contemporary usage is as ornaments in the form of bracelets in <b>hollow</b> silver <b>ware</b> inlaid with jewels for eyes and ears, which is given as a wedding gift to the bride. Makaras' jaws are made of pearls which are stated to possess aphrodisiac properties ...|$|R

5000|$|Originally {{conceived}} {{as only a}} flatware pattern, <b>hollow</b> <b>ware</b> was soon added to the line. As the demand for this pattern increased, a Golden Grand Baroque was introduced.|$|E
50|$|During {{the first}} decades he himself {{designed}} jewellery, <b>hollow</b> <b>ware</b> and cutlery. He generated his own style, among other things characterized by the so-called drawn out or stretched mountings holding the stones of the jewellery.|$|E
50|$|Silversmithing {{is the art}} {{of turning}} silver sheet metal into <b>hollow</b> <b>ware</b> (dishes, bowls, porringers, cups, candlesticks, vases, ewers, urns, etc.), {{flatware}} (silverware), and other articles of household silver, church plate or sculpture. It may also include the making of jewelry.|$|E
50|$|At first {{producing}} only cast-iron products, {{the company}} added nickel-plated ware in 1892.In 1894 Wagner {{was one of}} the first to make aluminum cookware.The company acquired their competitor Sidney <b>Hollow</b> <b>Ware</b> from Phillip Smith in 1897.A third brother, William H. Wagner, joined the company to run this operation.In 1903 Sidney <b>Hollow</b> <b>Ware</b> was sold back to Smith.By 1913 Wagner was distributing its products globally.The company said in its early advertisements:Wagner grew into a major manufacturer of cast iron and aluminum products, selling in the US and Europe.In addition to cookware it manufactured furnace grates, feed troughs, rubbish burners, kettles, and chemists' mortars.The company won many awards, and at one point had a 60% market share in cookware.Brand names included Wagner Ware, National, Long Life, Wardway and Ward's Cast Iron.|$|E
50|$|In 1905 Evald Nielsen {{opened his}} own shop and {{workshop}} in a cellar in Raadhusstræde, Copenhagen. At first {{he worked as}} silversmith as well as engraver, {{but after a few}} years he concentrated on silver producing and selling <b>hollow</b> <b>ware,</b> jewelery and first of all cutlery. In 1914 his workshop employed 14 persons.|$|E
50|$|He died in 1948 and was {{survived by}} {{three of his}} four sons. The eldest, Bishambar Dayal Varshnei who died in 1939, {{introduced}} <b>hollow</b> <b>ware</b> technology to India. His second son, Harish Chandra Varshnei is credited {{with the introduction of}} sheet glass manufacturing (with the Fourcault process) to Continental Asia (ex-Japan) in the 1920s.|$|E
50|$|The factory {{was again}} expanded; {{doubled in size}} in 1971 {{to allow for the}} booming pewter {{manufacturing}} business. Pewter became the major business of Stieff as sales of Sterling Silver waned since the 1960s. Sterling Silver <b>hollow</b> <b>ware</b> was made at Stieff until 1999, but pewter became the star of the company in the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
5000|$|Construction {{of the new}} factory {{began in}} the winter of 1786. The company made <b>hollow</b> <b>ware</b> (utility bottles) but the main output was window glass. In December 1787 Jean de Neufville wrote to Colonel Clement Dibble of Philadelphia, that [...] "the glass house comes very well, ... of course during the winter months exports to New York must be discontinued, while {{navigation}} on the Hudson was closed." ...|$|E
50|$|By {{the main}} {{entrance}} in the old Rolfe Street Baths are displays of local artefacts encompassing {{some of the many}} products which were made by Black Country industry, cast iron <b>hollow</b> <b>ware,</b> animal traps, vehicles, chain, anchors, enamels, weighing scales, laundry irons, nails, locks and fire clay products. The exhibition includes more fragile items such as glassware, reflecting the centuries-old industry that produced lead crystal glass and the Joseph Chance glass works between Oldbury and Smethwick.|$|E
50|$|In 1809, the Oneida Iron and Glass Company {{commenced}} operations, {{and during}} the War of 1812-15, was engaged in the manufacturing of shot and shell for the United States Army. After {{the close of the}} war, the Company engaged in the manufacturing of <b>hollow</b> <b>ware,</b> until 1865, when the business was discontinued. A large tannery is now located near the site of the old furnace. One other notable place of interest is the Old Taberg Cemetery.|$|E
50|$|The {{techniques}} of jiggering and jolleying {{can be seen}} as extensions of the potter's wheel: in jiggering, a shaped tool is slowly brought down onto the plastic clay body that has been placed on top of the rotating plaster mould. The jigger tool shapes one face, the mould the other. The term is specific to the shaping of flat ware, such as plates, whilst a similar technique, jolleying, refers to the production of <b>hollow</b> <b>ware,</b> such as cups.|$|E
50|$|Born in Glassboro, New Jersey, Ferrell {{attended}} the common schools and completed an academic course. Ferrell was elected {{a member of}} the Glassboro township committee in 1872 and 1873.

50|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century {{steam power}} was {{introduced}} to run a grinding hull and drop hammers in a silver die stamping shop. The key to the success of buildings such as Leah’s Yard was that they could be adapted to provide accommodation for a number of different metal industry trades on the same site. They provided adaptable, cheap work space by crowding buildings into a confined area. By 1905, the workshops around the courtyard of Leah’s Yard were occupied by eighteen little mesters whose trades included dram flask manufacturer, <b>hollow</b> <b>ware</b> and silver buffers, palette knife makers, steel fork manufacturer, silver ferrule maker, brass and nickel silver turners, electroplate producer and a cutler.|$|E
5000|$|Jacob Vollrath began {{building}} farm implements, steam engines, cast iron ranges and cooking utensils in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. He manufactured porcelain enameled pots, pans, plates, cups and other kitchenware by coating cast iron with ceramic glaze. In 1874 {{it was reported}} that J.J. Vollrath & Sons was constructing a factory for the production of porcelain <b>hollow</b> <b>ware</b> and cast iron fences. [...] In 1874 he formed the Sheboygan Cast Steel Co. and constructed a plant in Sheboygan to do general foundry work while his son Andrew was in Germany learning porcelain enamelling. The Sheboygan Cast Steel Company produced railroad frogs and small cast parts for the furniture industry. The company expanded into manufacturing cooking ranges and agricultural implements.|$|E
5000|$|Coal mining {{was added}} in 1912, after a major strike. In 1913, five {{additional}} wage boards {{were set up}} that covered <b>hollow</b> <b>ware</b> making, shirt making, sugar confectionery and food preserving, tin box making, and linen and cotton embroidery, along with {{a portion of the}} laundry industry. These extensions led to an additional 140,000 being covered by minimum wage legislation. Unions pushed for the 1918 Act to greatly extend the coverage of minimum wages [...] In 1917, Whitley councils or Joint Industrial Councils were established in 41 industries with over 2 million employees to bring together unions and management to discuss not only wages and conditions but also a wide range of related issues such as jobs, security, benefits and technical education.|$|E
5000|$|The {{building}} that housed Levison Brothers / California Jewelry Co. San Francisco was {{for many years}} located at 132, 134, and 136 Sutter Street, San Francisco California, and was designed and built by the firm partners. Per {{an article in the}} Daily Alta California, the building was a 3 story plus basement structure built at a cost of $130,000 (1871 U.S. dollars), and included full lapidary machinery for gem cutting, with Mr. Cullen the in-house head of jewelry design. Importations that year were $500,000 per annum, and manufactures $300,000 per annum. First floor tenants of the Sutter Street building included W.K. Vanderslice & Co. silversmiths who were well-known San Francisco producers of fine quality sterling silver flatware and <b>hollow</b> <b>ware</b> out of this facility starting approximately 1873.|$|E
5000|$|The Stieff Company {{was known}} for the quality and value of its silver products, {{beautiful}} hand chasing & Repoussé work. The most famous pattern made by Stieff and introduced in 1892 was Maryland Rose, later known as Stieff Rose. Other famous patterns include Chrysanthemum, Lady Claire, Princess, Puritan, Clinton, Forget Me Not, Homewood, Betsy Patterson and Corsage. Post World War II came Diamond Star, Personna, Rose Motif, Silver Surf, Carrollton, and Royal Dynasty. Colonial Williamsburg commissioned Stieff to create Queen Anne and Williamsburg Shell, while Smithsonian was made for the Smithsonian Institution. The two most rare patterns are Victoria and Plain; both discontinued prior to 1920. The Stieff craftsmen created Sterling <b>hollow</b> <b>ware,</b> flatware and novelty items including trophies and awards. The company thrived for generations, later moving into Pewter, Jewelry and plated wares.|$|E
50|$|In 1795, Albert Gallatin {{gathered}} several investors {{together as}} Albert Gallatin & Company to purchase {{tracts of land}} including the towns of Wilson's Port, Georgetown, and unused lots across the Monongahela River in Greensboro. They named the community New Geneva and built a general store, gun factory, sawmill, and a gristmill. Several years later, in 1797, Albert Gallatin & Company partner John Baddolet wrote to Gallatin {{about a group of}} German glassblowers who wanted to build a glass factory in the area. John Gabler, Adolph Eberhart, George Reppert, Lewis Reitz, Baltzer Kramer, and Christian Kramer had the skills and knowledge of glassmaking, but needed the capital and land for a glassworks. Gallatin, Badollet, and the glassblowers entered into the venture, along with partners James Nicholson, Louis Bourdillon, and Charles A. Cazenove. The first glasshouse was built near Georges Creek and production began on January 18, 1798. The glassblowers mainly produced window glass, although whiskey bottles, bowls, and other <b>hollow</b> <b>ware</b> were also made.|$|E
5000|$|The Stieff family sold Kirk-Stieff in 1990 to Lenox, {{makers of}} table top items like flatware, china and crystal. Lenox was a {{division}} of Brown-Forman Corp. Eventually silverware production was moved to Providence RI while sterling silver <b>hollow</b> <b>ware</b> and pewter would remain at the Stieff factory. Manufacturing ceased in 1999 in Baltimore, as operations were consolidated at a Lenox plant in Smithfield RI and later to New Jersey. Today the name survives as a brand of Lifetime Brands Inc., Lifetime bought Kirk-Stieff and other silver brands from Lenox in July 2007. Sale price was 8.775 million dollars (US Dollars) The silver is now made in Puerto RIco, but only as Sterling Flatware (unchased). Of the Stieff patterns, only the pattern Stieff Rose is still made, and that is by [...] "special order" [...] and {{can take up to}} a year for delivery. Several of the Kirk patterns are still made by Lifetime Brands, at the Lifetime Brands website, which I shall not list as commercial businesses should not be promoted at this site.|$|E
