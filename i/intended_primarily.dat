First They Killed My Father (2017), a drama set during Cambodia's Khmer Rouge era, again enabled her to combine both interests.

5|$|The {{first known}} game {{incorporating}} graphics that updated in real time, rather than {{only when the}} player made a move, was a pool game programmed by William Brown and Ted Lewis specifically for {{a demonstration of the}} University of Michigan-developed MIDSAC computer at the University of Michigan in 1954. The game, developed over six months by the pair, featured a pool stick controlled by a joystick and a knob, and a full rack of 15 balls on a table seen in an overhead view. The computer calculated the movements of the balls as they collided and moved around the table, disappearing when they reached a pocket, and updated the graphics continuously, forty times a second, so as to show real-time motion. Like previous video games, the pool game was <b>intended</b> <b>primarily</b> to showcase the computing power of the MIDSAC computer.|$|E
