She served with the Second Division of the Austro-Hungarian Navy's battleships and shelled Senigallia {{as part of the}} {{bombardment}} of the key seaport of Ancona, Italy, during May 1915. However, Allied control of the Strait of Otranto meant that the Austro-Hungarian Navy was, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> <b>and</b> <b>purposes,</b> effectively bottled up in the Adriatic. Nonetheless, the presence of the Zrínyi and other battleships tied down a substantial force of Allied ships.|$|E

This is because both these autonomous bodies resemble the Public Service in many respects since they adopt the procedures of the Public Service pertaining to appointments, terms and conditions of service and the remuneration system.

5|$|With the Ordos now {{adequately}} fortified, the Mongols avoided {{its walls}} by riding east to invade Datong and Xuanfu (宣府; present-day Xuanhua, Hebei Province), which were two major garrisons guarding {{the corridor to}} Beijing where no walls had been built. The two defence lines of Xuanfu and Datong left by the Northern Qi and the early Ming had deteriorated by this point, and <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> <b>and</b> <b>purposes</b> the inner line was the capital's main line of defence.|$|E

However, {{in times of}} drought, some of the {{structures}} become visible again. The lake dropped to its lowest level on January 22, 1977, more than 27feet (8m) below its average depth, and the amphitheater and bridges were visible {{for the first time}} in more than 10 years. Before the water flooded downtown Monte Ne again, the rest of the buildings were either bulldozed or moved to avoid problems for swimmers, boaters, and fishermen. The few bridges that spanned the lagoon and the amphitheater were not demolished.|$|E
5|$|Although {{formally}} {{separate from}} Greek Orthodox and Latin (Catholic) Christians, the Armenians consider their quarter {{to be part}} of the Christian Quarter. The three Christian patriarchates of Jerusalem and the government of Armenia have publicly expressed their opposition to any political division of the two quarters. The central reasons for the existence of a separate Armenian Quarter is the miaphysitism and distinct language and culture of the Armenians, who, unlike the majority of Christians in Jerusalem (also in Israel and Palestine), are neither Arab nor Palestinian. However, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> <b>and</b> <b>purposes,</b> the Armenians living in the Armenian Quarter are considered Palestinians by Israel and the United Nations (UN).

Until 1986 there were only 15 families in temporary buildings, and nowadays it grew to about 240 families. In 2005 a new neighborhood named Nof Hasharon was built adjacent to Nirit.

50|$|Following {{the decline}} of the Mughal power, the region of Deccan saw the rise of Maratha Empire. The Nizam himself saw many invasions by the Marathas in the 1720s, which {{resulted}} in the Nizam paying a regular tax (Chauth) to the Marathas. The major battles fought between the Marathas and the Nizam include Palkhed, Bhopal, Rakshasbhuvan, and Kharda, in all of which the Nizam lost. Following the conquest of Deccan by Bajirao I and the imposition of chauth by him, Nizam remained a tributary of the Marathas <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> <b>and</b> purposes.|$|R
5|$|Production of {{components}} would be split between Breguet and BAC, and the aircraft themselves would be assembled on two production lines; {{one in the}} UK and one in France, To avoid any duplication of work, each aircraft component had only one source. The British light strike/tactical support versions were the most demanding design, requiring supersonic performance, superior avionics, a cutting edge nav/attack system of more accuracy and complexity than the French version, moving map display, laser range-finder and marked-target seeker (LRMTS). As a result, the initial Br.121 design needed a thinner wing, redesigned fuselage, a higher rear cockpit, and after-burning engines. While putting on smiling faces for the public, maintaining {{the illusion of a}} shared design, the British design de facto departed from the French sub-sonic Breguet 121 {{to such a degree that}} it was <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> <b>and</b> <b>purposes</b> a new design.|$|E

The Plessy decision essentially capped a series of Supreme Court decisions which underscored the destruction of Reconstruction {{and the return of}} 2 ̆ 2 states rights 2 ̆ 2 to southern governments.

Having lost its Ethiopian sanctuary, as a consequence of this agreement, in May 1988 the SNM waged a historically daring invasion on Togdheer and Northwest regions of Somaliland. With this secretly and meticulously planned attack—a shocking surprise to both Siyad Barre and Mingeste Haile Miriam regimes — SNM fighters easily took Burao (Burco) and Hargeisa (Hargeysa) cities. Although the SNM was finally pushed out of the two cities, the lightning attack proved to be the deathblow of the Siyad Barre regime. The end result being the peaceful transfer of power, in a spirit of unity, at the 1990 SNM Congress — a lasting peace that survives today.|$|R
50|$|In the end, however, technical, reliability, {{and cost}} issues have proven nearly insurmountable. Indeed, the ASDS has been {{cancelled}} <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> <b>and</b> purposes; <b>all</b> {{that is left}} is an ASDS-1 improvement program to boost {{the performance of the}} existing sub and complete its operational testing. The Richmond Times-Dispatch notes that the ASDS mini-subs were originally supposed to cost $80 million each, but numerous problems with the first boat have ballooned its cost to $446 million so far (vendor and government facility costs inclusive). Instead of completing integration and entering service in 2000, testing continued and the first boat was officially delivered in July 2003. GlobalSecurity adds that the program was initially projected to cost $527 million (including delivery of all six boats), but it is now predicted to rise to more than $2 billion - significantly more than the $1.4 billion SSGN Tactical Trident conversion program to which it is related.|$|R

Although a stated aim of Future had been to circumvent the monopolistic distribution network, in the short term, Future was not making a profit, and the promise of higher sales and better advertising through Diamond seemed like a good offer. In addition, some retailers had expressed concern over dealing directly with Future, allegedly fearful that Diamond might make things difficult for them. Despite Future offering free shipping and large wholesale discounts and making their output [...] "100% returnable" [...] (thereby effectively removing the main risk to the retailers of unsold stock) - and thus making their product [...] "free <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> <b>and</b> purposes" [...] - retailers were not ordering enough copies to make Future viable.

[...] As the horsepower race continued, Chevrolet introduced a new version of their small block, with 283 cubic inches of displacement and 245 horsepower. They also introduced a limited number of Rochester fuel injected 283 engines that produced 283 horsepower, the first production engine to achieve 1 horsepower per cubic inch. [...] <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> <b>and</b> purposes, this made the 1957 Bel Air a [...] "hot rod", right off the production line. It was available with manual transmission only.
