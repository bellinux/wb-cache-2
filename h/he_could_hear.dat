5|$|Delayed by {{the late}} arrival of the York garrison, it was late evening before the Royalists were fully deployed. A flurry of rain showers and the discouragement of Newcastle and Eythin persuaded Rupert to delay his attack until the next day. From {{the ranks of the}} allied army <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the singing of psalms. As the Royalist troops broke ranks for their supper, Leven noted the lack of {{preparation}} among his opponents and ordered his men to attack at or shortly after 7:30pm, just as a thunderstorm broke out over the moor.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{residents}} on farming properties {{to the west}} of York heard a large aircraft flying low over the area. The aircraft seemed to be in trouble because the noise from the engines was changing significantly. At times the engines seemed to be operating normally but on at least one occasion all engine noise ceased for a brief time and then returned as a very loud, high-pitched noise. One resident reported that when all engine noise ceased <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> a rushing sound until the scream from the engines returned. Several residents reported seeing a bright flash of white light in the distance, followed by a loud crashing and scraping noise. Those closest to the crash could then see the yellow glow of a major fire.|$|E
25|$|Lima in {{the early}} twentieth century was filled with musical theatre and many well known musicians made their home in Lima.

60|$|Fortunately <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> Bosinney's passionate {{pleading}}--that pleading {{which the}} man of the world's conduct had let loose like a flood; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not see Irene shivering, as though some garment had been torn from her, nor her eyes, black and mournful, like the eyes of a beaten child. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> Bosinney entreating, entreating, always entreating; <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> her sudden, soft weeping, nor see that poor, hungry-looking devil, awed and trembling, humbly touching her hand.|$|R

25|$|Between 1916 and 1924, Gilbert Murray {{conducted}} 236 experiments into telepathy {{and reported}} 36% as successful, however, {{it was suggested}} that the results could be explained by hyperaesthesia as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> what was being said by the sender. Psychologist Leonard T. Troland had carried out experiments in telepathy at Harvard University which were reported in 1917. The subjects produced below chance expectations.|$|E
25|$|A {{production}} crew conducting research for Maxwell, an eponymous biographical film by the BBC, uncovered tapes {{stored in a}} suitcase owned by Maxwell's former head of security John Pole. Later in his life, Maxwell had become increasingly paranoid of his own employees and had the offices of those he suspected of disloyalty wired so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> their conversations. After Maxwell's death, the tapes remained in Pole's suitcase and were only discovered by the researchers in 2007.|$|E
500|$|The Appeal Court {{noted that}} Bamber had [...] "tried to ring his father back at White House Farm {{but he could}} not get a reply".

500|$|Gary Gygax {{was born}} in Chicago, the son of Almina Emelie [...] "Posey" [...] (Burdick) and Swiss {{immigrant}} and former Chicago Symphony Orchestra violinist Ernst Gygax. He was named Ernest after his father, but he was commonly known as Gary, the middle name {{given to him by}} his mother after the actor Gary Cooper. The family lived on Kenmore Avenue, close enough to Wrigley Field that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the roar of the crowds watching the Chicago Cubs play. At age 7, he became a member {{of a small group of}} friends who called themselves the [...] "Kenmore Pirates". In 1946, after the Kenmore Pirates were involved in a fracas with another gang of boys, his father decided to move the family to Posey's family home in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, where Posey's family had settled in the early 19th century, and where Gary's grandparents still lived.|$|E
500|$|On 16 December, {{working from}} the small yard behind 11 Exchange Buildings, the gang began {{to break through the}} back wall of the shop; number 10 had been unoccupied since 12 December. At around 10:00 that evening, {{returning}} to his home at 120 Houndsditch, Max Weil heard curious noises coming from his neighbour's property. Outside his house Weil found Police Constable Piper on his beat and informed him of the noises. Piper checked at 118 and 121 Houndsditch, where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the noise, which he thought was unusual enough to investigate further. At 11:00 he knocked at the door of 11 Exchange Buildings—the only property with a light on in the back. The door was opened in a furtive manner and Piper became suspicious immediately. So as not to rouse the man's concerns, Piper asked him [...] "is the missus in?" [...] The man answered in broken English that she was out, and the policeman said he would return later.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{after he}} kidnapped her, Garrido forced Dugard into a shower with him. The {{first time he}} raped her, {{she was still in}} handcuffs, which she wore during her first week in captivity. During that period, Dugard's only human contact was Garrido, who {{sometimes}} brought her fast food and told her amusing stories. He provided a bucket for her to use to relieve herself. At one point, he provided her with a television, but she could not watch the news and was unaware of the publicized search for her. Almost {{a month and a half}} after her kidnapping, by Dugard's recollection, Garrido moved her to a larger room next door, where she was handcuffed to a bed. He explained that the [...] "demon angels" [...] let him take her and that she would help him with his sexual problems because society had ignored him. He went on methamphetamine binges he called [...] "runs", during which he would dress Dugard up and spend time with her cutting out figures from pornographic magazines. He made her listen for the voices he said <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> from the walls. Garrido also often professed the belief that he was a chosen servant of God. These binges would end with him sobbing and apologizing to Dugard alternating with threats to sell her to people who would put her in a cage.|$|E

500|$|In early 1873, {{the navy}} created the {{civilian}} post of Inspector of Naval Bands, with a rank of Collegiate Assessor, and appointed Rimsky-Korsakov. This kept {{him on the}} navy payroll and listed on the roster of the Chancellery of the Navy Department but allowed him to resign his commission. The composer commented, [...] "I parted with delight with both my military status and my officer's uniform", he later wrote. [...] "Henceforth I was a musician officially and incontestably." [...] As Inspector, Rimsky-Korsakov applied himself with zeal to his duties. He visited naval bands throughout Russia, supervised the bandmasters and their appointments, reviewed the bands' repertoire, and inspected {{the quality of their}} instruments. He wrote a study program for a complement of music students who held navy fellowships at the Conservatory, and acted as an intermediary between the Conservatory and the navy. He also indulged in a long-standing desire to familiarize himself with the construction and playing technique of orchestral instruments. These studies prompted him to write a textbook on orchestration. He used the privileges of rank to exercise and expand upon his knowledge. He discussed arrangements of musical works for military band with bandmasters, encouraged and reviewed their efforts, held concerts at which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> these pieces, and orchestrated original works, and works by other composers, for military bands.|$|E
500|$|That evening, the 27th Infantry placed two belts of antipersonnel {{mines and}} trip flares {{across the road}} and stream bed [...] and [...] in front of its {{positions}} in the valley. After dusk, the North Koreans began shelling the general area of the 27th Infantry positions until just before midnight. ROK troops had planned to mount an attack, but {{it became apparent that}} the North Koreans would hit first. Then the KPA 13th Division launched a major attack against the entire UN front in and around the valley. Nine US tanks supported the infantry troops in the valley. Because it was on higher ground and positioned in front of all the other American units, C Company on the left of the road usually was the first to detect an approaching attack. That evening the C Company commander telephoned the regimental headquarters that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> tanks. When the artillery fired an illuminating shell he was able to count 19 North Korean vehicles in the attacking column on the road. The tanks and self-propelled guns approached the American positions, firing rapidly. Most of their shells landed in the rear areas. North Korean infantry moved forward {{on both sides of the}} road. Simultaneously, other North Korean units attacked the ROK troops on the high ridges flanking the valley.|$|E
500|$|The {{first issue}} was widely {{acclaimed}} in publications such as Publishers Weekly, MTV, Ain't it Cool News, Complex magazine, Comic Book Resources, iFanboy and ComicsAlliance; they all praised Vaughan's ability to incorporate elements of different genres, establishing the vast setting and mythology, and introducing characters that engaged the reader. Multiple reviewers likened {{the book to}} a combination of sci-fi/fantasy works such as Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings and classic works of literature such as Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet and the New Testament. AICN singled-out the use of the newborn Hazel as a lone individual to chronicle large-scale events from a past perspective, and Alex Zalben of MTV Geek remarking that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> a John Williams score as he read the book. Multiple reviewers also lauded Vaughan for beginning the story with Hazel's birth rather than hurting the story's pace with copious exposition of Alana and Marko's initial meeting and courtship. Todd Allen of The Beat approved of the book's unique [...] "flavor", singling out the characters' motivations, the immersiveness of its surrealist setting, the strangeness of the story's various oddities and the timely nature of the story's political undertones. Both Alex Evans of Weekly Comic Book Review and P. S. Hayes of Geeks of Doom called the series a [...] "classic"; Hayes also praised Image Comics for publishing such an [...] "original" [...] series. Also widely praised was Fiona Staples' artwork, which was characterized as [...] "glorious", with Zalben predicting that readers would [...] "fall head over heels in love" [...] with it, and Greg McElhatton of Comic Book Resources positively comparing it to that of Leinil Francis Yu, specifically her use of delicate lines to frame characters with large, bold figures and Staples' mixture of the familiar and the foreign together in her character designs to create a visually cohesive universe. AICN singled out Staples' handling of grand, sweeping space shots and other genre trappings, as well as her mastery of facial expressions – which AICN felt was perfectly suited to Vaughan's subtle dialogue. Todd Allen of The Beat wrote that Staples' landscapes at times play as much a part in the story as the foreground.|$|E

2500|$|Dallas Patrolman Marion L. Baker {{had been}} {{assigned}} to serve as a motorcycle escort for the motorcade, and he was riding just behind the camera cars. He testified that the first shot <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> was fired after he turned from Main St. onto Houston St. and had traveled approximately 60 to 80 feet along Houston as he approached the Houston and Elm streets intersection. Baker stated that he recognized the first shot <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> as the report of a high-powered rifle and that he thought the shots had originated from the building [...] "either {{right in front of me}} [...] or the one across to the right of it" [...] He also said that he noticed pigeons take flight up from the roof of the depository building and start flying around. Baker then quickly drove to the corner of Houston and Elm St., parked his motorcycle, then looked westward into the aftermath of persons screaming, running and laying on the ground. He then listened to Chief Curry's radio broadcast saying, [...] "Get some men up on that railroad track".|$|E
2500|$|Later, Captain Amadou Sanogo, {{identified}} as CNRDR's president, also went on state television {{to declare a}} dusk-to-dawn curfew [...] "until further notice".
