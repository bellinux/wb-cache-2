40|$|The {{evolving}} {{circumstances under}} which irrigation districts operate include growing demands for more accurate knowledge and accountability of flow throughout the conveyance network, along with increased needs for timely awareness when unexpected flow conditions are present. For open channel conveyance systems, critical-flow structures (<b>flumes</b> or <b>weirs)</b> offer the simplicity of a direct correlation between upstream water level and a corresponding discharge. Unfortunately at many locations where flow measurement is desired there may be insufficient head available for operation of a critical-flow measurement structure under all flow conditions that may occur. In recent years following development of computer-based design and calibration software, long-throated flumes have gained increasing popularity as the class of critical-flow structures which offer the greatest submergence tolerance. Numerous long-throated flumes have been installed at sites where head availability is marginal.

40|$|<b>Flumes</b> and <b>weirs</b> are {{hydraulic}} structures used {{to measure}} soil erosion and runoff at the outlet of agricultural catchments. Long-throated flumes use critical flow theory to determine discharge from a single water depth measurement upstream of the flume structure. In erodible catchments, sediments often deposit {{at the entrance of}} the flume, just where water level is measured, preventing proper discharge determination. This work proposes the combination of critical depth theory with two models of water flow at free overfalls that may be applied when the exit of the flume presents a drop. The method allows the recording of discharge measurements when the upstream water level sensor fails because of the accumulation of sediments. This paper proposes three discharge predictors: (1) one based on critical flow theory, (2) another based on the momentum balance between the critical section and the free overfall section, and (3) the third based on energy balance between the upstream water section and the free overfall section. Two flume performance indicators and a practical protocol are used to decide, based on the performance indicators, which of the three discharge predictors is most appropriate for every flow situation. The critical flow discharge predictor is recommended when the performance indicators show evidence of no sediment deposition at the upstream section. On the contrary, the momentum balance discharge predictor is recommended if there is evidence of sediments deposition. In case of uncertainty, the recommended discharge predictor is the one based on energy balance between the upstream and the free overfall sections. The proposed equations apply to trapezoidal flumes, but they could be adapted for other geometries. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The Study {{investigates the}} use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to analyze the mean {{characteristics}} of curvilinear flows in selected hydraulic structures. Three chosen turbulence models {{are associated with the}} Volume of Fluid (VOF) scheme to predict the characteristics of the mean flow. Many hydraulic structures in engineering practice involve highly curvilinear flows. Five typical hydraulic structures commonly used for flow regulation or flow measurement are considered in the present study; cut-throat <b>flumes,</b> lateral <b>weirs,</b> sharp-crested weirs, circular spillways, and siphon spillways. Velocity distributions, pressure distributions, water surface profiles, secondary flows, and discharge coefficients are the mean characteristics of flows that are studied. Presently, computing methods and high speed computers are strong tools for engineers. With the help of a properly validated numerical model, one can avoid the time consuming and expensive experimental tests based on the physical models to obtain the characteristics of highly curvilinear flows encountered in hydraulic practices. This is {{based on the fact that}} unlike physical models, it is far simpler to apply changing boundary conditions and flow parameters to a solved numerical model and obtain a flow characteristics for hydraulic structures associated with highly curvilinear flows. The flows in hydraulic structures are turbulent. Hence, one needs to solve numerically the continuity equation and momentum equations, including turbulent stresses, as the governing equations of turbulent flows. Because the above mentioned flows are generally complex and highly curvilinear, the transport equations are needed to model the turbulent stresses in the momentum equations. In the present study, three Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) schemes are used to simulate the turbulent flows. Specifically, the Reynolds stress model (RSM), the Standard k-[varepsilon] model, and the RNG k-[varepsilon] model were used in the present study. Further, the VOF scheme is adopted to find the shape of free surface profile...|$|R

Its purpose is to report on laboratory investigation on the flow over different types of oblique weirs, including behaviour and hydraulic characteristic of the flow, different phenomena in the neighbourhood of the weir, hydraulic parameters and physical laws that govern the process. To that end, many experiments were performed in a shallow flume under various flow conditions. Two different types of impermeable weirs are tested, including a rectangular sharp-crested weir and a rectangular broad-crested weir, both placed 450 obliquely to the flow direction. These weirs are schematically designed with vertical upstream and downstream walls, sharp edges, and two small end parts of each weir perpendicular to the flow. Flow velocities were measured using Particle Tracking Velocimetry technique, which helps gaining instantaneous whole field velocity maps. In conjunction with Matlab we can get almost necessary statistical information. By changing the flow discharge and the downstream water level, different flow behaviour and various phenomena like vortex, hydraulic jump, undulation, flow divergence, flow concentration, etc. can be observed. The data collected from measurements are used to investigate the hydraulic process and the phenomena of interest. This report also aims at a quantitative view on the energy loss and the discharge coefficient. It is shown that the flow tends to change its direction to perpendicular direction with the weir crest. This leads to the difference in water levels at two ends of the weir, the flow concentration at {{on one side of the}} <b>flume</b> behind <b>weir,</b> the variation in flow velocity distribution. In case of emerged flow condition, the flow behind weir becomes highly turbulent and very complex, which make it difficult to perform accurate measurements.

40|$|In river {{engineering}} problems {{information on}} discharges and water levels {{is essential for}} many reasons. For irrigation and drinking water purposes {{it is very important}} to know how much water can be extracted from a river. Managers of waste water stations need to know how much they can release without exceeding the norms, and information on flood waves in the past help to predict the probability of flood waves in the future. Discharge measurements are therefore necessary. Different methods to measure a river discharge exist, such as the velocity area method, the moving boat method and methods using structures like <b>flumes</b> and <b>weirs.</b> Another method is the dilution method, based on the dilution of a soluble, non-disintegrating substance, to be released in the river. For steady flows, the principles of this method are rather simple, and recommendations on how to perform the measurements already exist (ISO Handbook). However, for unsteady flows, this method is much more complicated, and even its applicability is questionable. Studies on this topic, in which rivers were schematised as prismatic channels have already been carried out. In the present study the practice is the central issue. The applicability of the dilution method is investigated for mountain rivers with irregular cross-sections, big rocks and unsteady discharges. In chapter 2 the principles of the dilution method are explained, and the studies made thus far are outlined, as well as the approach in the present study. In chapter 3 the basic equations for the motion of water and transport processes, necessary for a transport model that can deal with the typical problems of an irregularly shaped mountain river, are formulated. A numerical scheme is derived in chapter 4, resulting into a flow-and-transport-simulating computer program (FATS). Dilution discharge measurements are simulated in imaginary rivers under flood wave conditions. The river discharge is then a time dependent upstream boundary condition, and a few measurements (water levels, concentrations) are generated. In chapter 5 a numerical procedure is developed (FINDQ) to compute the upstream river discharge, which uses only these measurements without any further information on characteristic river parameters. Determination of these parameters is an identification problem, which is solved using the DUD procedure. The quality of the discharge determination can be estimated by comparing the result with the original upstream boundary condition in FATS, supposed to be 'true'. Finally, in chapter 6, attention is paid to the field work and equipment required to obtain real measurements for the discharge determination. Using the FINDQ-DUD algorithm, the river discharge as a function of time can then be computed to a certain degree of accuracy, which is the eventual aim of this study.

40|$|This {{report is}} the {{conclusion}} of a comprehensive set of experiments, which were performed on weirs placed obliquely in an open channel. Its purpose is to report on laboratory investigation on the flow over different types of oblique weirs, including behavior and hydraulic characteristic of the flow, different phenomena in the neighborhood of the weir, and hydraulic parameters and physical laws that govern the process. The report also aims at presenting a quantitative view on the energy loss and the discharge coefficient for oblique weirs. To that end, many experiments were performed in a shallow flume under various flow conditions. Three different types of impermeable weirs are tested, namely a rectangular sharp-crested weir, a rectangular broad-crested weir (both placed 45 degrees obliquely to the flow direction) and a dike-form weir with both upstream and downstream slopes of 1 : 4. The last type was tested with several oblique angles of 0, 45 and 60 degrees with the incident flow. By adjusting the flow discharge and the downstream water level, different flow regimes and states reveal the complex three dimensional structure of the flow with various phenomena like hydraulic jump, undulation, flow concentration, flow divergence, gyre formation, etc. In case of emerged flow condition, the flow behind weir becomes highly turbulent and very complex, which {{make it more difficult to}} perform accurate measurements. This flow regime also accounts for the higher head loss and energy dissipation than in case of submerged flow. Generally speaking, the hydraulic phenomena that happen in the neighborhood of an oblique weir are equivalent for different weir form, although there are some remarkable differences such as the size of the recirculation zone behind weir, and the amplitude of the undulation waves. Experimental data were obtained by many instruments and techniques; most of them had been carefully calibrated and were highly accurate and reliable. The data collected from acoustic and electro-magnetic single point velocimeters and depth measurements were used to investigate the hydraulic process and the phenomena of interest. Meanwhile the whole surface flow velocity field was measured using particle tracking velocimetry technique, which helps obtaining instantaneous whole field velocity maps. Combine with mathematic tools we can interpret the data and gain necessary statistical information. When the oblique angle of the weir is altered, both the flow direction and the flow rate change. The flow always tends to keep its direction to nearly perpendicular to the weir crest when it reaches and passes the weir. This leads to the difference in water levels at two ends of the weir, the flow concentration at on one side of the <b>flume</b> behind <b>weir,</b> the variation in flow velocity distribution and other asymmetries across the flow. Increasing the oblique angle, the effective length of the weir increases significantly, whereas the discharge coefficient Cd slightly decreases. Together they make the discharge capacity of the oblique weir increases. Finally, the discharge coefficient and its relations to other flow and geometry parameters obtained from this research were compared to the available knowledge on oblique weirs, including the published researches from De Vries (1959), Borghei et al. (2003) and the numerical models simulations from Wols (2005). The common findings between researches enhanced each other reliability; whereas the differences are a motivation for further studies.
