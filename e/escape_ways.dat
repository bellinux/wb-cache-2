40|$|Segregation of {{conveyor}} roadways is a ventilation {{practice that}} is being increasingly applied in Australia. It is largely driven by the legislated requirements in Queensland pertaining to separation of <b>escape</b> <b>ways</b> from the mine. This legal requirement {{was based on a}} recommendation from the Moura No. 2 Wardens Inquiry into the mine disaster that claimed 11 lives. The report recommended “the introduction of a requirement for all underground mines to have one intake airway that is completely segregated from other parallel intake airways so as to provide two separate means of egress from the mine via an intake airway”. This recommendation seeks to assist mineworkers to escape from a mine after a fire by providing them with an airway that is free from smoke or contaminants. The concept of an airway being “completely segregated” is an ideal that is challenging to implement in practice when considering the effect of leakage. The practice of belt segregation is concerned with the potential for fires in the belt roadway although there are numerous other potential fire sources in underground coal mines. A review of segregation practices has been conducted applying ventilation engineering principles. Four different scenarios have been analysed with regard to the effectiveness of the segregation stoppings in preventing potential fire contaminants migrating {{to other parts of the}} mine. The results show that in some cases the benefits of segregation to a person evacuating a mine in the event of a fire range from beneficial to detrimental. This is influenced by many factors including the location of that individual in that particular mine. There is room for improvement in the design and implementation of <b>escape</b> <b>ways</b> in underground coal mines. <b>Escape</b> <b>ways</b> need to be planned and designated with regard to the potential sources of fire, pressure differentials between <b>escape</b> <b>ways</b> and the operational practicalities of maintaining the pressure differential between them...|$|E
40|$|The walking {{speed of}} {{passengers}} {{is important in}} estimating the time re-quired to evacuate a ship. Therefore we investigated the walking speed on stairs and in corridors during ship listing and dynamic ship motion condi-tions, using the TNO Ship Motion Simulator. Data were obtained from sub-jects between 18 and 83 years of age. Ship listing reduced walking speed up to about 35, dependent on the direction of tilt. Seniors were about 15 slower than other age categories. Ascending stairs slowed down walking speed up to 40 for all age categories, descending up to 30. Another find-ing was that people needed the handrail during ship listing. This imposes a considerable reduction on the specific flow through the <b>escape</b> <b>ways.</b> Dy-namic ship movements slowed down walking speed up to 15 with in-creasing frequency and with increasing amplitude. At large eccentric posi-tions, parasitic linear accelerations will be the main factor reducing specific flow: passengers need handrails if these accelerations exceed 0. 5 m/s². For the purpose of predicting the time required for evacuations, the reduction in passenger walking speed and the reduced capacity of <b>escape</b> <b>ways</b> {{should be taken into}} account in the IMO guidelines...|$|E

40|$|Partnership makes a {{difference}} [...] . here is one example. Imagine trying to escape when working in an enclosed space hundreds of feet underground. Emergencies like fires or explosions are frightening potential hazards for the approximately 44, 000 underground mine workers in the United States. U. S. law requires underground miners to participate in mine emergency evacuation drills, but these drills are conducted in smoke-free environments that do not fully prepare workers for conditions they might encounter in a real escape situation. Several U. S. mining companies approached NIOSH to help them better prepare their workers for underground emergencies. Working with NIOSH researchers, the group created an innovative program to plan, conduct, and evaluate evacuation exercises using nontoxic smoke to simulate a real fire. Over 1, 900 workers in nine mines traveled 700 to 1, 000 feet through smoke-filled passages with visibility less than five feet. Miners used technologies identified or developed by NIOSH to assist their escape, such as chemical light sticks, audible strobe lights, reflective materials, directional lifelines, lighted vests, and hand-held laser pointers. As {{a result of these}} exercises, several of the mining companies have installed directional lifelines in their <b>escape</b> <b>ways,</b> purchased chemical light sticks, and are exploring the use of hand-held lasers. The Mine Safety and Health Administration has also required directional lifelines in <b>escape</b> <b>ways</b> of underground coal mines that are ventilated with conveyor belt entry air. As word of the training spread, so did the number of mining companies that wanted to participate and include smoke simulation training at their facilities. The long-term outcome of this training is a workforce better prepared to deal with emergency situations in a safe manner.

40|$|Both in {{military}} and civil applications, {{there is an}} urgent need for a highly up-to-date road data, which should be ideally semantically structured (into main roads, walking paths, <b>escape</b> <b>ways,</b> etc.) with application-driven attributes, such as road width, road type, surface condition and many others. A vectorization algorithm processing aerial images recently acquired yields an up-to-date road vector data, which are, however, often represented by wriggly, noisy polylines without semantics. The reasons for zigzagged street courses are insufficiencies in the intermediate results of sensor data processing (orthophotos, elevation maps) and occlusions caused by trees, buildings, and others. In the current contribution, an improved computation of geometric attributes will be explained which makes a difference between straight and circular (or elliptic) polylines. Using improved attributes, the candidates for polylines having identical course and sharing a junction are determined. From such candidates, we form chains of polylines. These chains correspond better to the intuitive perception of the term street than the previously used road polylines, because, even after being interrupted by narrower side roads, a chain maintains its label. The generalization of chains with simultaneously adjusting positions of junctions is evidently performed. We apply a generalization with the purpose-based modification of a well-known polyline simplification algorithm once chain-wise and once polyline-wise {{in order to show}} - by means of qualitative results - the advantages of the chain-wise generalization...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies show}} an {{increase}} in the population of beavers, nutria and other rodents in vast regions of central Europe over the last 15 years. Unfortunately, this caused in many instances considerable damage on large rivers along dykes and earthworks in the floodplain areas, leading to an increased risk of bank failures. However, most of these mammals belong to protected species. This work is aimed at showing positive experience in cooperation with universities, research institutes and environmental agencies regarding measures to permanently safeguard the banks using composite erosion control systems with polymer coated steel wire net (as flexible reinforcement component) and a geosynthetic (to promote vegetation growth). The steel mesh component works as an effective long-term barrier against the intrusion of mammals, discouraging them from digging inside the core of the dyke. An analysis of the sensitive areas to be protected led also to definition of the characteristics of these interventions (length, shape, <b>escape</b> <b>ways,</b> population areas, etc.). The study will present several additional benefits when using polymer steel nets along dykes, such as: high and durable erosion protection in overflow areas, promotion of fast and effective vegetation growth (increasing stability), surface protection against ice impacts (in northern regions), ease of installation, maintenance, ability to conform to irregular shapes of the slope.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Visibility {{of escape}} routes is most {{important}} to guarantee the safety of people indoors during fires. In {{the case of a}} fire, visibility is strongly in-fluenced by the smoke present in the room. In the present work, the extinction co-efficient of the visible light has been experimentally measured {{in the presence of the}} smoke produced by four different test fires, named TF 2, TF 3, TF 4, and TF 5. Tests have been carried out in a specially suited test room in the Italian Fire De-partment Research Center, provided with instruments to measure the optical density of smoke and the spectral extinction coefficient. The results show that, between the smokes produced in the test fires, TF 3 be-haves as the most absorbent one, for the so-called white smokes (with a predomi-nance of particles of condensed liquid), and TF 4 for the black smokes (with predominantly soot particles). Results can also be used to quantitatively calculate the light intensity reduc-tion due to the possible fire that could be produced in a room, in order to properly design the emergency lighting system of the <b>escape</b> <b>ways.</b> Verification tests with a normal emergency lamp have been performed to check this statement. A differ-ence between the computed and measured reduction of illuminance has been dis-covered, and can be ascribed to a large amount of scattered light in the white smokes. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed...|$|E

40|$|The biomechanical {{action of}} an orthesis for the {{conservative}} treatment of AIS has two goals: correction and stabilization. These goals have been pursued through very well established principles of correction, {{developed over the}} years, divided in terms of efficacy (the correct positioning of pushes, {{as well as through}} <b>escape</b> <b>ways</b> and proper drivers of the forces and stops) and acceptability (compliance, perfect body design, maximal freedom in the ADL). To achieve all these goals, the Sforzesco brace has been developed through progressive changes and verification. Finally, we discovered we had something new, and summarised it in the SPoRT acronym: Symmetric, Patient-oriented, Rigid, Three-dimensional, active. The SPoRT concept always requires a customised construction of the brace according to the patient's individual requirements. It's possible to apply CAD-CAM technologies, which usually allow us to obtain the best results in this case, but without using pre-built forms stored in databases, as is usually done. Once done, a final test must be made on the patient so as to change the first theoretical project and adapt it in the best possible way, depending on the real interaction between the body and the brace. The results that are today available on the SPoRT concept relate to the Sforzesco brace and necessarily are short-term, because the first treated patients are now reaching the third-year follow-up examination and haven't yet completed their treatments. According to first studies we can state that: tte Sforzesco brace is more effective than the Lyon brace after six months of treatment; the Sforzesco brace is equally effective as Risser Plast brace...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{trial was}} {{conducted}} with passage ways for migrating silver eel at a low head weir in a tributary to River Mörrumsån in Sweden. Behavioral traits useful for maximizing the number of eel per volume of water were sought. Six openings {{were made in the}} weir and supplied with various set-ups. One of the openings, a plain hole, served as a control. A second opening had significantly more eel passing than the control (11 versus 2; p 3 ̆c 0. 05). This setup (U-chute) had a raceway extending 7 m upstream of the weir. Inflow of water (and eel) took place through vertical slots on the side. Further development of this model is advocated. Two other set-ups had about the same number of eel passing (4 and 2) as the control. The first was a nature like bypass. The other, the M-chute, had a submerged raceway extending 7 m upstream. Inflow took place over the sides. The last two set-ups had no eel passing through or entering, and very few eel were observed near. The first was a dead end (no water flow) and the second had a flow of water coming out of the entrance. A separate trial, involving silver eel and modified water quality, was carried out at the aquarium experimental facility at Ar, Sweden. Eel, kept in 4 m² experimental fresh water fish tanks, were offered two narrow <b>escape</b> <b>ways.</b> One opening had an inflow of brackish water, the other opening had an inflow of fresh water. Significantly more eel passed out through the opening with brackish water than the opening with fresh water (21 versus 8; p 3 ̆c 0. 05). This effect was however not deemed strong enough for attracting eel to passages. It is argued {{there is a need for}} better knowledge of silver eel migration behavior during the descent to the sea...|$|E
40|$|Mine {{operators}} often rely on mine {{rescue teams}} {{to save lives}} during an underground emergency such as an underground fire, explosion or roof fall. It is extremely important that team members are provided with adequate exploration equipment and that training simulations are conducted in a realistic manner. A series of mine rescue training exercises was developed, conducted and evaluated by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{in cooperation with the}} Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, Bureau of Deep Mine Safety. The exercises were conducted at NIOSH s Lake Lynn Laboratory during 1995 to 1998 and resulted in improved technology and training for mine rescue teams. For example, existing technologies were identified to help rescue teams during exploration. These included chemical light sticks to identify team members and mark crosscuts and mine materials, strobe lights for mapping out <b>escape</b> <b>ways,</b> and a helmet mounted thermal imaging system to see through smoke. A hands-free communication system showed potential for enhanced communications between team members and the fresh air base. A new high-visibility team lifeline that allows for flexibility of movement between team members was developed. A positive-pressure inflatable escape device (IED) was used to isolate the hazardous environment from fresh air and allow rescue team members to traverse through. An inflatable feed-tube partition that can rapidly block large openings such as underground passageways and simultaneously provide a feed-tube for high-expansion foam generators was also deployed for several simulations. During the simulations, mine rescue team members donned self-contained breathing apparatuses (SCBA) and traversed more than 305 -m of mine passageways filled with nontoxic smoke. Visibility ranged from 0. 3 to 0. 9 -m. In one area of the mine, a kerosene heater was used to simulate a fire and reduce the oxygen concentration. In another area, a 1. 5 pct methane zone was established. The team members searched for "victims, mapped the passageways, built temporary stoppings and ventilated the smoke-filled entries.

40|$|A {{conversion}} {{describes the}} process in which a ship undergoes large modifications. For cruise ships, conversions are costly processes that often require drydocking and lengthy off-hire periods. There are many drivers that necessitate such large investments, including technical considerations such as a vessel’s age or operational efficiency, as well as strategic ones such as market competition and revenue. Regardless of the reason, conversions demand large workloads, {{both in terms of}} the drydock process and the planning period beforehand. The primary aim of this thesis is to investigate what can be done during a vessel’s initial design stage to reduce the length, planning, and cost of future conversions. Ideally, recommendations should be straightforward, simple to implement, and cost-effective. By identifying potential initial design improvements, a provident approach is established for a ship’s entire lifecycle. In order to develop this outline, current conversion trends are studied at a broad, industry-wide and narrowed vessel level in order to identify today’s conversion drivers and tasks. Using this information, four common conversion cases are selected as the foundation for the initial design solutions. These cases are broad enough to cover all relevant conversion tasks yet narrow enough to yield specific design solutions. A rules-based approach is then adopted to identify the technical challenges and initial design implications of each case, with a focus on SOLAS regulations. The cases are studied with respect to three disciplines, chosen due to their respective impacts on conversion processes. Namely, these are structural fire protection, means of escape and evacuation, and stability. Each discipline carries significant weight both in initial design and conversion engineering and the final recommendations therefore have broad influences. The final list of initial design recommendations covers the three disciplines through arrangement principles and conservative margin allowances. Structural fire protection methods primarily focus on the classification of perimeter bulkhead and deck boundaries. Those for means of escape and evacuation are presented as both arrangement and margin solutions. The dimensioning of <b>escape</b> <b>ways,</b> lifesaving capacity, and evacuation routing are the bases for recommendations within this discipline. Finally, stability concerns are addressed through allowances and planning aimed at both the construction period and entire service life of a ship. The thesis concludes with a case study and a discussion of the results and future implications of the research. The goal of the case study is to illustrate the methods identified and identify the prevalence and impact of the various conversion cases by considering a recently built cruise ship. The emphasis of the case study is on structural fire protection, since it is the most tangible of the three disciplines. The following discussion highlights the limitations and future considerations of both the study itself and the topic as a whole...|$|E
