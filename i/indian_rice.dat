6000|$|Of {{this last}} {{character}} {{were two of}} the men on the open glade just mentioned, while their companions were of the race of the aborigines. What is much more remarkable, the four were absolutely strangers to each other's faces, having {{met for the first time}} in their lives, only an hour previously to the commencement of our tale. By saying that they were strangers to each other, we do not mean that the white men were acquaintances, and the Indians strangers, but that neither of the four had ever seen either of the party until they met on that grassy glade, though fame had made them somewhat acquainted through their reputations. At the moment when we desire to present this group to the imagination of the reader, three of its number were grave and silent observers of the movements of the fourth. The fourth individual was of middle size, young, active, exceedingly well formed, and with a certain open and frank expression of countenance, that rendered him at least well-looking, though slightly marked with the small-pox. His real name was Benjamin Boden, though he was extensively known throughout the northwestern territories by the sobriquet of Ben Buzz--extensively as to distances, if not as to people. By the voyageurs, and other French of that region, he was almost universally styled le Bourdon^ or the [...] "Drone"; not, however, from his idleness or inactivity, but from the circumstances that he was notorious for laying his hands on the products of labor that proceeded from others. In a word, Ben Boden was a [...] "bee-hunter," [...] and as he was one of the first to exercise his craft in that portion of the country, so was he infinitely the most skilful and prosperous. The honey of le Bourdon was not only thought to be purer and of higher flavor than that of any other trader in the article, but it was much the most abundant. There were a score of respectable families on the two banks of the Detroit, who never purchased of any one else, but who patiently waited for the arrival of the capacious bark canoe of Buzz, in the autumn, to lay in their supplies of this savory nutriment for the approaching winter. The whole family of griddle cakes, including those of buckwheat, <b>Indian</b> <b>rice,</b> and wheaten flour, were more or less dependent on the safe arrival of le Bourdon, for their popularity and welcome. Honey was eaten with all; and wild honey had a reputation, rightfully or not obtained, that even rendered it more welcome than that which was formed by the labor and art of the domesticated bee.|$|E
40|$|Presented diploma {{thesis is}} focused on {{analysis}} of selected biologically active substances in different kinds of natural and peeled rice. In rice samples phenolic compounds, antioxidant activity, content of saccharides and vitamin C were analysed. Active substances and saccharides were analysed by UV-VIS spectrophotometry and RP-HPLC-UV/VIS. Content of phenolic compounds and saccharides was measured before and after acid hydrolysis. The content of these compounds increased several times because of release of active substances from glycosides. As a part of diploma thesis basic sensory analysis was performed and consumer questionnaires were evaluated. The highest level of antioxidant activity was detected in <b>Indian</b> Wild <b>rice.</b> The highest content of total polyphenols and flavonoids was detected in Red Rice Natural before acid hydrolysis. After acid hydrolysis the highest content was detected in <b>Indian</b> Wild <b>rice.</b> The highest content of individual flavonoids, phenolic acids and catechins was detected in natural <b>rice</b> <b>Indian</b> Wild, <b>Rice</b> Three colours and in two samples of rice parboiled. The highest content of total and reducing saccharides was found in <b>rice</b> <b>Indian</b> Wild before hydrolysis, while after hydrolysis the content was very similar in all rice samples. The amount of individual monosaccharides after acid hydrolysis increased, while total content of disaccharides decreased.
