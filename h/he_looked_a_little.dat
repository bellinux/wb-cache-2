25|$|I {{turned a}} face to him of such joy that no-one in that great crowd could have had one moment's doubt. I just said, Oh Tom, & he seized my hand, & said how do you do, in quite a loud voice. He walked {{straight}} on to the platform then & gave a most remarkably clever, well thought out lecture.... I stood the whole time, holding Polly up high in my arms. Polly was very excited & wild. I kept my eyes on Tom's face the whole time, & I kept nodding my head at him, & making encouraging signs. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> older, more mature & smart, much thinner & not well or robust or rumbustious at all. No sign of a woman's care about him. No cosy evenings with dogs and gramophones I should say.|$|E
500|$|With the {{intention}} of playing the 2015 season in the forward line alongside Jesse Hogan and Chris Dawes, a groin injury hampered Watts' pre-season training for three months heading into the season. He had a strong start to the season recording seventeen disposals, seven marks and three goals in the club's twenty-six point win against Gold Coast at the MCG in round one and was named in Melbourne's best players by AFL Media. After a buoyant start to the season, he quickly found himself facing negativity from the media after the round three loss to Adelaide at the Adelaide Oval where he dropped two marks in quick succession, with one leading to an Adelaide goal. Multiple media figures called {{for him to be}} dropped with David Schwarz stating he [...] "might have to sit out a week" [...] and Dermott Brereton professing [...] "you have to make a stand as to what your team stands for, and that means you can't bring him back in until you are convinced he will not do that again"; Jason Dunstall supplemented these statements by noting [...] "he can't relapse into these kind of performances", adding [...] "I don't like using the word, but <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> soft at times".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} days, Wolfman Jack made {{sporadic}} public appearances, usually as a Master of Ceremonies (an [...] "MC") for rock bands at local Los Angeles clubs. At each appearance <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> different because Smith had not decided what the Wolfman should look like. Early pictures show {{him with a}} goatee; however, sometimes he combed his straight hair forward and added dark makeup to look somewhat [...] "ethnic". Other times {{he had a big}} afro wig and large sunglasses. The ambiguity of his race contributed to the controversy of his program. It was not until he appeared in the 1969 film, A Session with the Committee (a montage of skits by the seminal comedy troupe The Committee), that mainstream America got a good look at Wolfman Jack.|$|E
5000|$|Kermit the Frog: What's {{wrong with}} the drummer? <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> crazed.Zoot: Oh, <b>he's</b> just upset about missing the Rembrandt exhibit at The National Gallery.Animal: him in a wild, angry tone Renoir!! ...|$|R
60|$|The man ceased his task. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> around, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bewildered.|$|R
60|$|I {{paused and}} glanced at Mr. Ravenor. <b>He</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> puzzled, but not {{particularly}} interested.|$|R
60|$|Spencer stood {{squarely}} {{upon his}} feet. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> tired.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> shamefaced, and {{his light}} eyes {{were full of}} {{something}} like contrition.|$|E
60|$|It {{was very}} clear that he was not pleased to see him. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> uneasy.|$|E
60|$|Cecily. I {{suppose that}} is why <b>he</b> often <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bored when we three are together.|$|R
6000|$|... "The game's up, Ryder," [...] said Holmes quietly. [...] "Hold up, man, or you'll be {{into the}} fire! Give him an arm {{back into his}} chair, Watson. He's not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!" ...|$|R
60|$|The man spoke no word of reply, though <b>he</b> did <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{surprised}} {{as the party}} left him and rode away.|$|R
6000|$|No: {{that was}} not what he was in search of. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> lower down: and read on regularly, from that point, as follows: ...|$|E
60|$|As {{he passed}} along the street, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> anxious. Sherlock Holmes--and {{possibly}} even Doctor Watson--would have deduced {{that he had}} something on his conscience.|$|E
60|$|But {{now that}} his anger was over <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> frightened. Felicity was not there. We found her in the kitchen, {{lighting}} up the fire.|$|E
60|$|They all drank fervently {{and with}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{guttural}} murmur. Von Schwerin {{set down his}} empty glass. <b>He</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> glum.|$|R
60|$|They hurried outside. French {{blew his}} whistle. One of the plain-clothes men came running {{up from the}} avenue. <b>He</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sheepish.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I {{think he}} is not a beggar, for he wanted to pay Monna Lisa, only she asked him to do work for her instead. And he gets himself shaved, and his clothes are tidy: Monna Lisa says he is a decent man. But {{sometimes}} I {{think he is}} not in his right mind: Lupo, at Peretola, was not in his right mind, and <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> like Lupo sometimes, as if he didn't know where he was." ...|$|R
60|$|Each time I saw Ellesworth <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> shabbier {{than the}} last. Then {{one day he}} called me up on the telephone, and made an appointment.|$|E
60|$|When he {{came out}} again <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> pale and tragic, but what passed between them in that {{interview}} was never known, even when all was known.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit embarrassed. [...] "I {{asked her}} to--right {{there in front}} of that window. I said, 'I want you to let me buy you that white dress.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How's the old Colonel? The best feller--excuse my {{calling him}} a feller--but he is, and a good one too. I went to see Mr. Binnie, my other tenant. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> yellow about the gills, Mr. Binnie. Very proud woman that is who lives with him--uncommon haughty. When will you come down and take your mutton in the Regent's Park, Mr. Clive? There's some {{tolerable}} good wine down there. Our reverend gent drops in and takes a glass, don't he, missis?" ...|$|R
60|$|While {{the rest}} of us were talking away, and Scott and Harry finding fault with each other, the captain came back. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> in <b>a</b> <b>little</b> better humor.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she stopped}} short, and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> at her <b>a</b> <b>little</b> abruptly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I will do so, papa. He wishes it himself.' Then with an effort, he added, 'I {{am sorry}} I went to-day; I ought not, but--' and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> foolish.|$|E
60|$|He {{listened to}} the replies without expression. When it came to Philip's turn he fancied that Mr. Gibbons stared at him curiously. Philip's clothes were neat and tolerably cut. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{different}} from the others.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> surprised. [...] "My hand is not over-clean, miss, as you see," [...] {{opening it}} with a comical look of regret on his face. [...] "I've just come in from work and haven't washed yet." ...|$|E
500|$|However, Roger Ebert {{argued the}} film was a [...] "glum, lackluster movie in which even the big effects {{sequences}} seem dutiful instead of exhilarating." [...] He also felt that [...] "Brandon Routh lacks charisma as Superman", surmising that he [...] "may have been cast because <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> like Reeve". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that Warner Bros. should have rebooted the series {{along the lines of}} Batman Begins. He also felt Bosworth, at 22 years old, was too young to portray Lois Lane, and the climax did not [...] "match the potential of the tiring 154-minute-long film".|$|R
60|$|They walked about {{under the}} trees; {{suddenly}} they came {{face to face}} with Mr. Sabin. <b>He</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> worn, but <b>he</b> was as carefully dressed as usual, and he welcomed them with a smile and an utter absence of any embarrassment.|$|R
60|$|The Marquis {{laid down}} his book. <b>He</b> was {{certainly}} <b>looking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> tired. Letitia {{came up to}} his side and patted his hand.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bewildered, but he obeyed her, as {{most people}} did {{when she was in}} earnest. She gave the driver an address somewhere in the city. As soon as they were off, she turned towards him.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> self-conscious. [...] "Well--I--shall be delighted. You see, I {{was awake}} {{most of the}} night, and in riding one gets hungry--and, besides, breakfast was a little hurried. In fact, I don't {{remember}} that I had any." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> wistfully {{from one}} to the other. Antagonism and dislike were written in their faces. Even Pamela, who was skilled in the art of subterfuge, made little effort to conceal her aversion. Nevertheless, he {{continued}} doggedly.|$|E
60|$|Tony {{seemed to}} groan, and sat still <b>a</b> pace. Then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> up with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> flush in his face.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> {{appeared}} presently, <b>looking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> irritable {{at being}} disturbed in his slumbers. [...] "I made my report at the office," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> at me <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> and then, without resenting {{the freedom}} of my question--"The Countess Scarabelli, you mean," [...] he said.|$|R
