5|$|While {{serving as}} regimental quartermaster, Grant yearned for a combat role; when finally allowed, {{he led a}} cavalry charge at the Battle of Resaca de la Palma, demonstrating his equestrian ability at Monterrey by {{carrying}} a dispatch past snipers while hanging {{off the side of}} his <b>horse,</b> <b>keeping</b> the animal between him and the enemy. Before leaving the city he stopped at a house occupied by wounded Americans, giving them assurance he would send for help. Polk, wary of Taylor's growing popularity, divided his forces, sending some troops (including Grant's unit) to form a new army under Major General Winfield Scott. Traveling by sea, Scott's army landed at Veracruz and advanced toward Mexico City. The army met the Mexican forces at the battles of Molino del Rey and Chapultepec outside Mexico City. For his bravery at Molino del Rey, Grant was brevetted first lieutenant. At San Cosmé, men under Grant's direction dragged a disassembled howitzer into a church steeple, reassembled it, and bombarded nearby Mexican troops. His bravery and initiative earned him his second brevet promotion to captain. On September 14, 1847, Scott's army marched into the city; Mexico ceded the vast territory, including California, to the U.S. on February 2, 1848.|$|E
25|$|Until the {{initiation}} ceremony and induction into {{the society and}} the receiving of the word, the horseman who were not {{members of the society}} but potential candidates would have trouble with horses. This would often be caused by older ploughmen who were members of the society tampering with their horses. They would put things like tacks under the horse's collar to cause it to behave irrationally. This would be unknown to the potential candidate as the techniques for training and controlling the horses were not yet given to him. Most of these techniques were based on the horse's sharp sense of smell. Foul substances placed in front of the horse or on the animal itself would cause it to refuse to move forward. This technique is known as jading and is still used by horse trainers today. There were also pleasant smelling things that were used to make a horse move forward or calm down. If the substance was an oil it could be wiped on the trainer's forehead, they would then {{stand in front of the}} animal and the smell would draw it towards them. This practice was often used in taming unruly horses. There were also pleasant smelling and inviting materials, such as sweets, that the horseman could keep in their pocket in order to calm, attract, and subdue a crazed <b>horse.</b> <b>Keeping</b> these techniques secret, along with the myth that there was a word that only the horseman knew that gave them and them alone power over horses helped guarantee their reputation, prestige, job security, and pay. The same type of logic and protection of trade secrets can be seen among modern magicians who keep their tricks secret and only share them with other members of their trade.|$|E

60|$|A single {{horseman}} {{followed the}} chase, upon a steed so thoroughly {{subjected to the}} rein, that it obeyed the touch of the bridle {{as if it had}} been a mechanical impulse operating on the nicest piece of machinery; so that, seated deep in his demipique saddle, and so trussed up there as to make falling almost impossible, the rider, without either fear or hesitation, might increase or diminish the speed at which he rode, which, even on the most animating occasions of the chase, seldom exceeded three-fourths of a gallop, the <b>horse</b> <b>keeping</b> his haunches under him, and never stretching forward beyond the managed pace of the academy. The security with which he chose to prosecute even this favourite, and, in the ordinary case, somewhat dangerous amusement, as well as the rest of his equipage, marked King James. No attendant was within sight; indeed, it was often a nice strain of flattery to permit the Sovereign to suppose he had outridden and distanced all the rest of the chase.|$|E

It was {{important}} that he should not be seen. The horse would attract no attention, because Prescott had a number, and hardy, range-bred horses are often left to run loose through the winter. Still, clear moonlight streamed through between the slender trees, and there was a glow from the windows of the house. As Wandle drew nearer it he moved with greater caution. He was fortunate in having done so, for he stopped with a start as two black mounted figures cut against the sky not far in front of him. They were clearly visible as they crossed an opening, and though he stood in shadow beside a denser growth of trees his heart beat faster as he watched them. They were riding slowly, keeping out of view of the house, which was significant, because had they been neighbors of Prescott's returning from a visit to him they would have taken no trouble to avoid being seen. These were police troopers, watching the homestead.|$|E

To show how serious they are about this proposal, they promised that they will never return to Italy, and as guarantees for this, they will send their own sons to the Italians. With these exaggerate but still unacceptable promises (knowing that Berengar will not accept their departure after the destruction they caused, and would want to take them all prisoners), the Hungarians managed to totally convince the king that their fate depends only from his goodwill. So the Italians responded harshly, threatening them, probably wanting their total surrender.|$|R

5000|$|Tribal {{people in}} what today is Turkmenistan first used the Akhal-Teke for raiding. The horses were their most treasured {{possession}} {{since they were}} crucial for income and survival. They selectively bred their <b>horses,</b> <b>keeping</b> records of the pedigrees via an oral tradition. Horses were managed and trained in very specific ways. Stallions were tethered next to the tent while mares and foals were free to seek forage. The stallions were covered from head to tail with up to seven layers of felt, which kept their coat short and shiny. Before raids they were put on a sparse diet {{to prepare them for}} the long ride through the desert with no water and hardly any feed. The horses were called Argamaks (divine or Sacred Horses) by the Russians, and were cherished by those who valued their speed and stamina in the desert and loyalty to their owner.

50|$|To {{ask for the}} {{haunches}} in, {{the rider}} uses the outside leg to guide the horse's hindquarters from the track, and the rider's hips and upper body mirrors the axis of the horse's hips and shoulders. The rider's outside leg is used behind the neutral position to controls the outside hind leg of the <b>horse,</b> <b>keeping</b> it inward from the track and under the horse's body. This both encourages and requires collection and impulsion in this movement. The rider's outside rein maintains the connection, preventing the horse from swinging the shoulders to the outside and straightening its spine, maintaining the energy produced by the horse's outside hind leg. The rider's inside leg asks the horse to bend {{in the direction of}} movement and to maintain forward motion and rhythm.

5000|$|Today, {{approximately}} 2 000 Finnhorses are {{in training}} and 3 000 are competing in harness racing. Finnhorse harness racing has recently decreased slightly, and occasionally coldblood heats have to be cancelled {{due to lack of}} participants. [...] As of 2004, less than 35 percent of all harness racing heats were open for coldblood horses, more than 5 percental units less than in the early 1990s. Harness racing in general is not experiencing any such decline. The decrease of the popularity of the Finnhorse can be result from many factors. For instance, the expenses of <b>horse</b> <b>keeping</b> in Finland are high, so light trotters, usable for competition a year earlier than a Finnhorse, are economically more desirable. Light trotter heats also have higher purses, as they attract more competitors and thus collect more entry fees. However, the Finnhorse is not necessarily unprofitable: its build withstands competition better than light trotters, and thus can be raced for many years. Success with a Finnhorse may also be more easily achieved, as many Finnhorse trotters are trained and raced more or less as a hobby and can succeed without requiring the dedication or focus of a full-time professional. Finnhorses have been so successful against other coldblood trotter breeds of Scandinavia, that in the 21st century, Finnhorses have been admitted in Swedish and Norwegian races only by invitation.|$|E
50|$|After rising {{tensions}} with Mexico following the United States' annexation of Texas, {{war broke out}} in 1846.

The sector contributes with new economic, social and physical possibilities, but also with conflicts between various stakeholders and interests. The overall aim of this work was to contribute to increased understanding of the new and diverse equine sector as a factor for peri-urban landscape development, with stakeholders’ as well as public perspectives. Specific objectives were to map out the influence of the equine sector on the development of multifunctional land use in peri-urban areas and to analyze stakeholder experiences and attitudes towards <b>horse</b> <b>keeping</b> as a land use. Further to outline specific features of <b>horse</b> <b>keeping</b> in peri-urban areas as a new and expanding area of research and to determine the significance of the issue within the broader context of land use and spatial planning.

Some of the footings were amended with P-sorbing materials, such as [Ca(OH) 2], [Fe 2 (SO 4) 3], or Fe-gypsum, to retain DRP. High DRP concentrations (17 – 18 mg l- 1) were observed in runoff from a woodchip footing amended earlier with Ca(OH) 2 and in sand footing amended with CaCO 3. However, application of Fe-gypsum to woodchips decreased the DRP load in percolation water by 83 % compared to the footing without Fe-gypsum. Fe compounds were better than Ca compounds.
