40|$|ABSTRACT. Forming {{simulation}} technologies keep {{on developing}} {{at a rapid}} pace, to address formability, tolerance control, and product performance issues throughout an increasing range of processes, and in ever more detail. Springback prediction, die compensation and assembly simulation continue to evolve, with new concepts to improve the accuracy of springback prediction and compensation. Prediction is addressed both from the numerical methods perspective, for example, using enhanced material models with elasto-plastic springback, and from a process perspective, for example by the incorporation of geometric drawbeads. Die compensation highlights how the integration of simulation and geometry plays an ever more important role, {{both in terms of}} improving accuracy and reducing lead time. Automotive components assembly processes include roll hemming and welding. The assembly simulation is the ideal solution for improving roll hemming, welding and the welding assembly processes, ensuring better part quality. The coupling of both stamping and welding simulation methodologies enables the user to optimize a complete manufacturing chain. The overall industrial objective is moving rapidly from simple <b>Draw-Die</b> compensation...|$|E
