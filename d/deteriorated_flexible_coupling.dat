To know the quality of the ductile cast iron, the properties and micro structure of the material should be known.

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increase}} in ship traffic in Arctic waters the later years, this challenges today's ship design. One of the challenges is the contact loads that occur, due to ice blocks encountering the ship propeller. The ice propeller interaction is a complicated process, and more knowledge on the effect of the ice propeller interaction on the ship propulsion drive train is needed. This master thesis focus on improving the dynamic mathematical model of one of the ship propulsion drive train components, namely the <b>flexible</b> <b>coupling.</b> The model developed is based on the Geislinger <b>flexible</b> <b>coupling,</b> and is developed using the bond graph approach with the 20 -sim simulation software. It takes in to account the major dynamic effects of the radially aligned springs and the oil flow between the oil chambers. Simulations show that the dynamic stiffness and damping coefficient of the <b>flexible</b> <b>coupling</b> model developed in this project, is heavily dependent on the deflection frequency and velocity. Both the damping factor and stiffness increases with frequency. This is due to an increase in both the amount of oil that is compressed, and the pressure difference between the oil chambers increases, with increasing deflection velocity. Simulations show that the static stiffness is mainly dependent on the geometry of the radially aligned springs, and that the dynamic stiffness is heavily dependent on the coefficient of discharge describing the oil flow between the oil chambers of the coupling. The coupling model was implemented in to a marine propulsion drive train established in another project, which was subjected to torsional ice impact loads, and compared to the original model. Simulations did show that the oil compressibility caused the <b>flexible</b> <b>coupling</b> to become stiffer than the reference model, during the rapid change of oil chamber volume. While the oil chamber volume change was less, the <b>flexible</b> <b>coupling</b> became less stiff than the reference model. It is recommended that the tapering of the radially aligned springs is included in the model as this affects the <b>flexible</b> <b>coupling</b> stiffness, especially during impact loads. Also it is recommended that CFD simulations are performed to verify the coefficient of discharge used in the model. </p...|$|R

40|$|In general, {{standard}} of ISO 10816 {{is used for}} drives of transport mechanisms, determinating general criteria and principles for oscillations of machines. On the basis of evaluative criteria of the standard mentioned above, vibrations of a belt conveyer were measured. By experimental measurements {{it was found that}} vibrations of the belt conveyer evidently exceed limiting values defined by the standard. For an improvement of unacceptable state, a consequential solution was suggested. The application of pneumatic <b>flexible</b> <b>coupling</b> in drive of the belt conveyer was one of the possible solution. Consequential experimental measurements for verification of vibrations confirmed that application of pneumatic <b>flexible</b> <b>coupling</b> resulted in decrease of vibrations by 60 %.

40|$|Abstract. Collaborative {{systems that}} {{automate}} {{the sharing of}} programmer-defined user interfaces offer limited coupling flexibility, typically forcing all users of an application to share {{all aspects of the}} user interfaces. Those that automatically support high coupling flexibility are tied to a narrow set of predefined user-interfaces.

The framework refines an abstract layered model of collaboration with structured application layers and automatic acquisition, transformation, and processing of updates. It has been used to easily provide <b>flexible</b> <b>coupling</b> in complex, existing single-user software and shown to support all known ways to share user-interfaces. Coupling flexibility comes at the cost of a small amount of additional programming. We have carefully crafted the framework to ensure that this overhead is proportional to the degree of coupling flexibility desired. 1...|$|R

Forming of the stiffness matrix has been described as well for the case when the stiffnesses of the elastic elements are variable functions of the turning angle, i. e. of time. The <b>flexible</b> <b>coupling</b> stiffness is then a nonlinear function described by polynomial while the stiffnesses of teeth of the meshed gears are nonlinear and periodic functions that have been described by Fourier series with corresponding number of members. For the system with the stiffness matrix of which the elements are nonlinear functions of time the computation of the eigenvalues has been performed with the <b>flexible</b> <b>coupling</b> stiffness linearized in vicinity of working point and with stiffnesses of teeth of the meshed gears that have been varied with minimal, mean and maximal values.
