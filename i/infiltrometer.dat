40|$|Abstract The {{effects of}} {{continuous}} (1 · 0 mg/l) and concentrated (10 mg/l) irrigation water-added polyacrylamide (PAM) on infiltration {{of a highly}} erodible Mediterranean soil were studied using recirculating furrow <b>infiltrometers.</b> Polyacrylamide avoided the seal formation observed in the wetted surface of the control furrow and helped to maintain higher infiltration rates for both PAM treatments. Mean final cumulative infiltration for the continuous and concentrated PAM experiments increased by 20 and 14 %, respectively, {{as the result of}} reduced seal formation and surface sealing. Steady-state furrow infiltration rates, evaluated with disc <b>infiltrometers</b> 15 h after irrigation and under soil water tensions of 40 and 100 mm, confirmed the infiltration benefit of PAM treatments. Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity calculated under the same tensions revealed that the PAM-treated furrows were about 95 % more permeable than the control. Polyacrylamide application also increased average saturated conductivity by 168 % because of more unblocked pores in the treated furrows. The ability of PAM to influence surface soil conditions and improve infiltration can greatly enhance management of irrigated Mediterranean soils by allowing longer irrigation and higher inflow rates. Application of 10 mg/l in the inflow only during the advance phase of the irrigation can reduce labour, and ensures that loss of PAM from furrow tail water is minimized and that quantities applied during the season are reduced...|$|R

The research {{was based on a}} case study approach, combining field measurements and simulations. The results were compared to publicized results from the raingarden at Risvollan and literature values addressing cold climate. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) provides a measure of infiltration capacity and is recommended to be above 10 cm/h in cold climate raingardens. The results show a seasonal variation in Ksat, from 1 cm/h (October) to 0. 05 cm/h (November-April). Simulation of a raingarden in Trondheim, show a change from 75 % to 25 % in the amount of winter inflow the raingarden infiltrate or drain when Ksat goes from 1 cm/h to 0. 05 cm/h.

50|$|There {{are three}} main {{problems}} related {{to the use of}} infiltrometers:1. The pounding of the <b>infiltrometer</b> into the ground deforms the soil causing cracks and increasing the measured infiltration capacity.2. Natural rainfall reaches terminal velocity. Also natural droplet sizes differ with different types of storms. Pouring water from a measuring cup however loses this momentum and variance.3.

50|$|Infiltration is {{the process}} by which water on the ground surface enters the soil. Infiltration rate in soil science {{is a measure of the}} rate at which soil is able to absorb {{rainfall}} or irrigation. It is measured in inches per hour or millimeters per hour. The rate decreases as the soil becomes saturated. If the precipitation rate exceeds the infiltration rate, runoff will usually occur unless there is some physical barrier. It is related to the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the near-surface soil. The rate of infiltration can be measured using an <b>infiltrometer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Double ring <b>infiltrometer</b> {{requires}} two rings: {{an inner}} and outer ring. The purpose {{is to create a}} one-dimensional flow of water from the inner ring, as the analysis of data is simplified. If water is flowing in one-dimension at steady state condition, and a unit gradient is present in the underlying soil, the infiltration rate is approximately equal to the saturated hydraulic conductivity.An inner ring is driven into the ground, and a second bigger ring around that to help control the flow of water through the first ring. Water is supplied either with a constant or falling head condition, and the operator records how much water infiltrates from the inner ring into the soil over a given time period.|$|E

40|$|In tilled soils, {{hydraulic}} properties required as {{input to}} process-based water balance models may undergo temporal changes during the cropping cycle, particularly {{as a result}} of raindrop impact. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of raindrop induced aggregate breakdown on changes to soil hydraulic properties in an Alfisol sown to wheat under minimum tillage and conventional cultivation at Kapunda, South Australia. Unsaturated hydraulic properties of the sandy loam A horizon were measured at two stages in the cropping cycle during Year 7 of the trial using tension <b>infiltrometers.</b> The surface was also subjected to simulated rainfall and the hydraulic properties re-measured after the soil water content had returned to the initial pre-rain value. Results showed that a pre-seeding, the total porosity was greater under conventional cultivation (CC) (0. 56 m 3 m- 3), that under direct drilling (DD) (0. 48 m 3 m- 3). Much of the additional porosity under CC was restricted to large voids that were air filled at a matric head of just - 20 mm. In consequence, at this supply potential, the hydraulic conductivity was significantly greater under DD (35. 6 mm h- 1) compared with CC (15. 3 mm h- 1). The sorptivity also followed a similar trend (11. 2 mm per 30 min under CC compared with 18. 4 mm per 30 min under DD). Later in the cropping cycle, the hydraulic properties displayed no significant differences between treatments. This was attributed to consolidation of the conventionally cultivated seedbed under natural rainfall, with total porosity decreasing from 0. 56 at pre-seeding to 0. 48 at post-harvest. Simulated raindrop impact had no effect on hydraulic conductivity or sorptivity measured at a supply potential of - 40 mm, but at a supply potential of - 20 mm the measured hydraulic conductivity was reduced to 4. 5 mm h- 1 at pre-seeding and 8. 6 mm h- 1 at post-harvest. These values were similar to the pre-rainfall simulation measurements at - 40 mm and suggest that the effect of aggregate disruption from raindrop impact was predominantly restricted to pores of equivalent radius > 0. 75 mm. Time to incipient ponding was predicted adequately using soil properties obtained at a supply potential of - 40 mm prior to rainfall, primarily because infiltration of intense rainfall into dry soil was dominated by sorptivity. It is concluded that tension <b>infiltrometers</b> provide a rapid and practical method for surveying temporal changes to surface hydraulic properties and that at this site there is no sustained influence of tillage on the measured hydraulic properties...|$|R
50|$|The SWMS_2D model (Šimůnek et al., 1992) {{considerably}} {{extended the}} capabilities of SWMII by including provisions for solute transport. Solute transport was described using the standard advection-dispersion equation that included linear sorption, first-order degradation in both the liquid and solid phases, and zero-order production in both phases. Several other numerical improvements were at the time also implemented in SWMS_2D. These included solution of the mixed form of the Richards equation as suggested by Celia et al. (1990), thus providing excellent mass balances in the water flow calculations. While SWMII could simulate water flow in either two-dimensional vertical or horizontal planes, SWMS_2D extended the range of applications also to three-dimensional axisymetrical flow domains around a vertical axis of symmetry. Examples are flow to a well, infiltration from a surface ring or tension disc <b>infiltrometer,</b> and infiltration from a surface or subsurface dripper.|$|E
50|$|Natural {{impervious}} {{areas are}} defined herein as land covers that can contribute {{a substantial amount}} of stormflow during small and large storms, but commonly are classified as pervious areas. These areas are not commonly considered as an important source of stormflow in most highway and urban runoff-quality studies, but may produce {{a substantial amount of}} stormflow. These natural impervious areas may include open water, wetlands, rock outcrops, barren ground (natural soils with low imperviousness), and areas of compacted soils. Natural impervious areas, depending on their nature and antecedent conditions, may produce stormflow from infiltration excess overland flow, saturation overland flow, or direct precipitation. The effects of natural impervious areas on runoff generation are expected to be more important in areas with low TIA than highly developed areas. The NLCD provides land-cover statistics that {{can be used as a}} qualitative measure of the prevalence of different land covers that may act as natural impervious areas. Open water may act as a natural impervious area if direct precipitation is routed through the channel network and arrives as stormflow at the site of interest. Wetlands may act as a natural impervious area during storms when groundwater discharge and saturation overland flow are a substantial proportion of stormflow. Barren ground in riparian areas may act as a natural impervious area during storms because these areas are a source of infiltration excess overland flows. Seemingly pervious areas that have been affected by development activities may act asimpervious areas and generate infiltration excess overland flows. These stormflows may occur even during storms that do not meet precipitation volume or intensity criteria to produce runoff based on nominal infiltration rates. Developed pervious areas may behave like impervious areas because development and subsequent use tends to compact soils and reduce infiltration rates. For example, Felton and Lull (1963) measured infiltration rates for forest soils and lawns to indicate a potential 80 percent reduction in infiltration as a result of development activities. Similarly, Taylor (1982) did <b>infiltrometer</b> tests in areas before and after suburban development and noted that topsoil alteration and compaction by construction activities reduced infiltration rates by more than 77 percent.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} tillage practices on soil hydraulic properties was studied in a mature, drip irrigated apricot orchard with a 7 % slope, in Murcia (SE Spain). The soil had a loamy texture. Three soil tillage treatments were applied between {{the rows of}} trees: 1) control treatment (non-tilled, although weeds were cut to ground level using a blade attached to a tractor following the common practice of the area), 2) perforation treatment, in which soil surface was mechanically perforated with an adapted plough, and 3) mini-catchment treatment, in which small banks were manually raised perpendicular {{to the line of}} emitters. The perforation and mini-catchment treatments increased the infiltration of water into the soil surface: the hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity values were higher than those of the control treatment. Both tillage treatments were designed to prevent runoff and both increased rainwater penetration of the soil. They may therefore be useful as part of water management strategies in semiarid areas with scarce water resources, such as Mediterranean countries.

The eight equations were also fitted to rainfall data to permit calculating runoff from small surface areas {{about the size of a}} typical crop plant. Comparison of the regression curves for infiltration and rainfall suggested that land management practices that appropriately alter the soil surface will permit wide-range control of infiltration, runoff, and erosion; and thereby achieve conservation and more efficient use of soil and water resources for crop production.

40|$|Little {{attention}} has been paid to the possibility that soil water repellency could enhance non-equilibrium water flow and solute transport through macropores present in structured clay soils. In this study, we measured infiltration and solute transport in a clay soil under near-saturated conditions in both the field using tension <b>infiltrometers</b> and in the laboratory on undisturbed soil columns. Measurements were made on adjacent plots under grass and continuous arable cultivation. Steady-state field infiltration rates measured using water and ethanol as the infiltrating fluids demonstrated that the soil macroporosity under grass was better developed, but that much of the structural pore system was inactive due to water repellency. No water repellency was detected on the arable plot disturbed by tillage. Dye tracing showed that the conducting macroporosity was largely comprised of earthworm channels in the grassed plot and inter-aggregate voids resulting from ploughing in the arable plot. Tracer breakthrough curves measured on field-dry soil indicated rapid macropore transport in columns taken from both plots, although the degree of non-equilibrium transport appeared somewhat stronger under grass. This result, which was attributed to water repellency, was also consistent with the larger flow-weighted mean pore size found in the field infiltration experiments. It is concluded that water repellency in undisturbed structured clay soils can have significant effects on the occurrence of non-equilibrium water and solute transport in macropores. <br /...|$|R
