Grêmio scored with Jonas in the stoppage time after a corner kick, but Palmeiras secured 3 points. After the win Palmeiras was awaited by the Choque-Rei derby with São Paulo on the next Sunday. The 1st half of the match was bad for both teams, but in the second half São Paulo scored from two counterattacks, in the first one the new boy, Lucas, made a wonderful finish past Deola and the second was a great assist <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> to Fernandão make 2–0. Palmeiras was unlucky in the 2nd half, where the team almost scored 4 times.|$|E
25|$|Anger's {{first film}} {{was created in}} 1937, {{when he was only}} ten years old. The short, titled Ferdinand the Bull, had been shot on the ends of 16mm film that had been left unused after the Anglemyer's family {{vacation}} to Yosemite National Park, where they had been making home movies with it. In Ferdinand the Bull, which has never been made publicly available, Kenneth dressed as a matador, wearing a cape, while two of his friends <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boy</b> Scouts played the bull. His second work, Who Has Been Rocking My Dreamboat, which Anger himself often considers to be his first proper film, was made up of footage of children playing during the summer, accompanied with popular songs by bands like the Ink Spots. Anger had created Who Has Been Rocking My Dreamboat in 1941, when he was fourteen, shortly before the Attack on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent entry of the United States into the Second World War, adding to the poignancy of this early work. The following year he produced another amateur film, Prisoner of Mars, which was heavily influenced by Flash Gordon, a series that he was a fan of. In this science fiction-inspired feature, he added elements taken from the Greek mythological myth of the Minotaur and himself played the protagonist, as well as constructing a small volcano in his back yard to create a form of home-made special effect. It is believed that many of these early films are lost, with Anger burning much of his previous work in 1967.|$|E
25|$|In Bayonetta 2, a {{few months}} after the events of the first game, Bayonetta and Jeanne are {{fighting}} an outbreak of angels when a supernatural summoning goes wrong and Jeanne is killed by Gomorrah. Bayonetta then sets out to rescue Jeanne's soul from a realm called Hell, heading to the sacred mountain of Fimbulvintr to find the doorway to Inferno. Arriving at the town of Noatun, she encounters a mysterious boy named Loki who serves as her guide to the mountain. She also reunites with Luka, who tells her about the legend of the deity Aesir, who created and ruled the human realm. During their journey, the pair is attacked by a masked Lumen Sage who targets Loki. When they reach the Gates of Hell, Bayonetta meets, Loptr, who is apparently working with the Masked Lumen and knows Loki very well. Through a vision, he reveals to her that her father Balder was not responsible for the witch hunts and he tried to save her mother. But Rosa was killed by an unknown assailant who looks like Loki. To escape their attackers, Bayonetta and Loki flee into Hell but the Masked Lumen follows them. Separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> Bayonetta fights through hordes of demons and successfully rescues Jeanne's soul. However, she finds Loki being attacked again by the Masked Lumen. Intervening, Bayonetta fights the Sage, who is revealed to be her father Balder at a young age. Balder had been targeting Loki for Rosa's murder. Suddenly, Loki unwillingly sends both Bayonetta and Balder back into the past during the Witch Hunts. Bayonetta meets her mother Rosa, and the two of them fight against the angels. During the battle, she fights a younger version of Loptr, and she realizes that he was Rosa's murderer and framed Loki for the crime. Later encountering Balder, the pair enter the Umbran Witch sanctuary to find that Loptr had killed Rosa. When he escapes, Bayonetta tells Balder that the killer was not Loki. She then opens a time portal and the two of them return to the present. With the help of Jeanne flying a fighter jet, Bayonetta and Balder set out for Fimbulvientr to confront Loptr, who has captured Loki. He reveals that he and Loki are the two halves of Aesir. When Aesir divided his power into the Eyes of the World, he split his soul into two: Loki being the good half and Loptr being the evil half. But Loptr decided to take back his power and become Aesir once again. Draining Loki of his power, Loptr takes the Eyes from both Bayonetta and Balder and transforms into Aesir. While the Witch and the Sage team up to fight Aesir, Loki uses his hidden power to erase the Eyes and weaken Loptr. Bayonetta and Balder defeat Loptr and split his soul from his body. When he tries to escape into the past to be reborn, Balder stops him by sealing the soul inside his body, despite Loki warning that it will corrupt him. Bayonetta tearfully bids farewell to her father as he is transported back into the past and becomes the corrupted Father Balder. As Loki begins to fade, he promises to Bayonetta that they will meet again when he is reborn.|$|E

[...] The Observer editor Kitty Empire wrote in an assessment, [...] "With the exception of their persuasive No 1 single, [...] "What Makes You Beautiful", their songs aren't wildly distinctive."

The band that plays at the party, the Diamond Smugglers, is from Thomas's hometown of Austin, Texas, and they played at Thomas's wedding and 40th birthday party. The scene near the end with Logan smashing a police car to get intentionally thrown in prison confused the crew, who doubted its artistic and technical plausibility. However, Thomas {{was pleased with the}} final output, and producer Dan Etheridge called it [...] "one of the most compact and interesting visual storytelling pieces in the episode." [...] The episode went over budget. In this episode, Mac wears a shirt that says [...] "Ask Me About My STD", something which several critics commended for its comedic value. Thomas {{came up with the idea}} for the shirt and hired one of the other guest actors in the scene for another episode, commenting [...] "It's funny, I actually made that up, and I now have one, too." [...] In addition, because Thomas was so pleased with the acting in the scene <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> who hands Mac a whiskey, he hired the actor for a role in a subsequent episode as an important witness to Dean O'Dell's death.|$|E
