40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} gas-disk gravity on the planetesimal dynamics in inclined binary systems, where the circumprimary disk plane is tilted by a significant angle (i_B) {{with respect to the}} binary disk plane. Our focus is on the Lidov-Kozai mechanism and the evolution of planetesimal eccentricity and inclination. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we find that, on one hand, the disk gravity generally narrows down the Kozai-on region, i. e., the Lidov-Kozai effect can be suppressed in certain parts of (or even the whole of) the disk, depending on various parameters. In the Kozai-off region, planetesimals would move on orbits close to the mid-plane of gas-disk, with the relative angle (i^') following a small amplitude periodical oscillation. On the other hand, when we include the effects of disk gravity, we find that the Lidov-Kozai effect can operate even at arbitrarily low inclinations (i_B), although lower i_B leads to a smaller Kozai-on region. Furthermore, in the Kozai-on region, most planetesimals' eccentricities can be excited to extremely high values (âˆ¼ 1), and such extreme high eccentricities usually accompany orbital flipping, i. e., planetesimal orbit flips back and forth between anterograde and retrograde. Once a planetesimal reaches very high orbital eccentricity, gas <b>drag</b> <b>damping</b> will shrink the planetesimal orbit, forming a "hot planetesimal" on a near circular orbit very close to the primary star. Such a mechanism, if replacing the planetesimals and gas <b>drag</b> <b>damping</b> with Jupiters and tidal damping respectively, may lead to frequent production of hot-Jupiters.

40|$|Cyclotron modes are studied on rigid rotor, multi-species ion plasmas {{confined}} in a Penning-Malmberg trap. Collective effects and radial electric fields shift the cyclotron mode frequencies {{away from the}} ``bare'' cyclotron frequencies for each species s. These frequency shifts are measured on the distinct cyclotron modes (m = 0, 1, and 2) with sinusoidal azimuthal dependence. We find that the frequency shifts corroborate a simple theory expression in which collective effects enter only through the ExB rotation frequency and the species fraction, when the plasma is radially uniform. At ultra-low temperatures, these plasmas exhibit centrifugal separation by mass, and additional frequency shifts are observed in agreement with a more general theory. Additionally, quantitative measurements of the plasma heating from short resonant cyclotron bursts {{are found to be}} proportional to the species fraction. These cyclotron modes are used as a diagnostic tool to estimate the plasma composition, in order to investigate the damping of Langmuir waves due to inter-species collisions. Experiments and theory of this collisional inter-species <b>drag</b> <b>damping</b> are presented. This also provides the first experimental confirmation of recent theory predicting enhanced collisional slowing due to long-range collisions. <b>Drag</b> <b>damping</b> theory, proportional to the collisional slowing rate, is in quantitative agreement with the experimental results only when these long-range collisions are included, exceeding classical collision calculations by as much as an order of magnitude. At large wave amplitudes, Langmuir waves exhibit harmonic generation, non-linear frequency shifts, and a parametric decay instability, which are experimentally investigated. The parametric wave-wave coupling rates are in agreement with three-wave instability theory in the dispersion dominated oscillatory coupling regime, and in the phase-locked exponential decay regime. However, significant variations are observed near the decay threshold, including slow, oscillatory growth of the daughter wave.

40|$|In rapidly {{rotating}} planetary atmospheres {{that are}} heated from below, equatorial superrotation can occur through convective generation of equatorial Rossby waves. If the heating from below is sufficiently strong that convection penetrates {{into the upper}} troposphere, then the convection generates equatorial Rossby waves, which can induce the equatorward angular momentum transport necessary for superrotation. This paper investigates {{the conditions under which}} the convective generation of equatorial Rossby waves and their angular momentum transport lead to superrotation. It also addresses how the strength and width of superrotating equatorial jets are controlled. In simulations with an idealized general circulation model (GCM), the relative roles of baroclinicity, heating from below, and bottom drag are explored systematically. Equatorial superrotation generally occurs when the heating from below is sufficiently strong. However, the threshold heating at which the transition to superrotation occurs increases as the baroclinicity or the bottom drag increases. The greater the baroclinicity is, the stronger the angular momentum transport out of low latitudes by baroclinic eddies of extratropical origin. This competes with the angular momentum transport toward the equator by convectively generated Rossby waves and thus can inhibit a transition to superrotation. Equatorial bottom <b>drag</b> <b>damps</b> both the mean zonal flow and convectively generated Rossby waves, weakening the equatorward angular momentum transport as the drag increases; this can also inhibit a transition to superrotation. The strength of superrotating equatorial jets scales approximately with the square of their width. When they are sufficiently strong, their width, in turn, scales with the equatorial Rossby radius and thus depends on the thermal stratification of the equatorial atmosphere. The results have broad implications for planetary atmospheres, particularly for how superrotation can be generated in giant planet atmospheres and in terrestrial atmospheres in warm climates. ...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 A global, multi-level, wave-mean flow model {{based on}} an {{approximate}} version of the primitive equations is developed to investigate {{the development of a}} baroclinic wave field initially confined to a single zonal wavenumber. The effects of physical processes (surface <b>drag</b> and thermal <b>damping)</b> and internal diffusion on the evolution have been examined. The nature of the mean flow adjustment by the nonlinear baroclinic waves is also studied. For a simulation with a relatively strong internal diffusion it is found that a single life cycle characterized by baroclinic growth and barotropic decay is obtained (as in Simmons and Hoskins, 1978), whereas with weaker diffusion the wave undergoes secondary life cycles before a nearly wave-free state is reached (as in Barnes and Young, 1991). In an experiment with weak 4 th order diffusion secondary life cycles occur with little net decay. Relatively strong barotropic growth follows the initial life cycle. In experiments with surface drag (Rayleigh friction) and thermal damping (Newtonian cooling), repeated life cycles of baroclinic growth and barotropic decay can be obtained. It is found that in the complete absence of surface drag, the flow evolves to a nearly wave-free state after one secondary cycle. This demonstrates that surface drag {{plays an important role in}} nonlinear baroclinic instability. With relatively strong surface drag multiple life cycle behavior is found for sufficiently strong thermal damping. Such a behavior strengthens for very strong thermal damping. A steady wave state in which the wave amplitude equilibrates at an essentially constant level has only been obtained with very strong "potential vorticity damping". Both the "barotropic governor" process (James and Gray, 1986) and the baroclinic adjusment process are responsible for major parts of the stabilization of the mean flow in simulations with and without surface <b>drag</b> and thermal <b>damping.</b> However, the "barotropic governor" process dominates the flow evolution in the model simulations without surface <b>drag</b> and thermal <b>damping.</b> The "barotropic governor" modifies the meridional gradient of zonal mean potential vorticity, which influences the baroclinic adjustment...|$|R

40|$|Previous work on modal {{analysis}} of mooring lines has been performed from different theoretical formulations. Most {{studies have focused}} on mooring lines of a single homogeneous material, and the effect of added mass and damping produced by the water has not been examined deeply. The variational formulation approach, employed in this research to perform a {{modal analysis}}, has been useful to study the behavior of several realistic mooring lines. The cases presented are composed from segments of materials with different mechanical characteristics, more similar to those in current offshore projects. In the newly proposed formulation, damping produced by transverse motion of the mooring line through the surrounding water has been added to the modal analysis. The modal analysis formulation applied in this work has been verified with calculations from commercial software and the results are sufficiently accurate to understand the global behavior of the dynamics of mooring lines with the damping produced by the sea water. Inclusion of linearized <b>drag</b> <b>damping</b> in the modal analysis showed that the modal periods of the mooring systems studied depend on the amplitude of the transverse motion of the mooring line. When more amplitude in the motion is expected more damping is obtained. Two realistic designs of mooring lines were compared: one made up with a main insert of steel rope, called ?Steel System?, and one composed by a main insert of polyester, named ?Polyester System?. Comparing the natural periods of both systems, the Steel System appears to be safer because its fundamental natural period is more distant from the wave excitation periods produced by storms. The same happens considering the wave excitation periods produced by prevailing seas. In this case the natural periods of the Polyester System are nearer to the wave excitation periods causing fatigue loads. The transverse mode shapes for lateral motions of the mooring lines are observed to be continuous and smooth across material transitions, such as transitions between chain and wire rope and transitions between chain and polyester rope.

In the absence of tidal friction, it is concluded that if the period for precession of the spin axis is much shorter than the orbit precession period, the obliquity of the object will remain very nearly constant in spite of the movement of the orbit normal. It is further concluded, that since the obliquity is not changed by the motion of the orbit plane, the decay of the obliquity towards zero by tidal friction is not significantly altered by this motion.

Stochastic reconnection is {{a generic}} effect, due to field line wandering, {{in which the}} speed of reconnection {{is determined by the}} ability of ejected plasma to diffuse away from the current sheet along magnetic field lines, rather than by the details of current sheet structure. We consider the limit of weak stochasticity, so that the mean magnetic field energy density is greater than either the turbulent kinetic energy density or the energy density associated with the fluctuating component of the field. We consider field line stochasticity generated through a turbulent cascade, which leads us to consider the effect of neutral drag on the turbulent cascade of energy. In a collisionless plasma, neutral particle viscosity and ion-neutral <b>drag</b> will <b>damp</b> mid-scale turbulent motions, but the power spectrum of the magnetic perturbations extends below the viscous cutoff scale. We give a simple physical picture of the magnetic field structure below this cutoff, consistent with numerical experiments. We provide arguments for the reemergence of the turbulent cascade well below the viscous cut-off scale and derive estimates for field line diffusion on all scales. We note that this explains the persistence of a single power law form for the turbulent power spectrum of the interstellar medium, from scales of tens of parsecs down to thousands of kilometers.

We show that forcing the flow at wavelengths inherent to the unforced flow drastically <b>damps</b> <b>drag</b> oscillations associated with the vortex shedding and vorticity bursts, up to their complete suppression. The overall parameter analysis suggests that this damping results from the surplus of streamwise vorticity provided by the forcing, that tends to stabilize the ternary vorticity lobes observed at the aft part of the bluff body. In addition, conversely to a blowing-type or suction-type forcing, the blowing/suction-type forcing involves strong nonlinear interactions between locally decelerated and accelerated regions, severely affecting both the mean drag and the frequencies representative of the vortex shedding and vorticity bursts...|$|R
40|$|The {{meteorology}} of hot Jupiters {{has been}} characterized primarily with thermal measurements, but recent observations suggest the possibility of directly detecting the winds by observing the Doppler shift of spectral lines seen during transit. Motivated by these observations, we show how Doppler measurements can place powerful constraints on the meteorology. We show that the atmospheric circulation [...] and Doppler signature [...] of hot Jupiters splits into two regimes. Under weak stellar insolation, the day-night thermal forcing generates fast zonal jet streams from the interaction of atmospheric waves with the mean flow. In this regime, air along the terminator (as seen during transit) flows toward Earth in some regions and away from Earth in others, leading to a Doppler signature exhibiting superposed blueshifted and redshifted components. Under intense stellar insolation, however, the strong thermal forcing damps these planetary-scale waves, inhibiting their ability to generate jets. Strong frictional <b>drag</b> likewise <b>damps</b> these waves and inhibits jet formation. As a result, this second regime exhibits a circulation dominated by high-altitude, day-to-night airflow, leading to a predominantly blueshifted Doppler signature during transit. We present state-of-the-art circulation models including nongray radiative transfer to quantify this regime shift and the resulting Doppler signatures; these models suggest that cool planets like GJ 436 b lie in the first regime, HD 189733 b is transitional, while planets hotter than HD 209458 b lie in the second regime. Moreover, we show how the amplitude of the Doppler shifts constrains the strength of frictional drag in the upper atmospheres of hot Jupiters. If due to winds, the ~ 2 -km/sec blueshift inferred on HD 209458 b may require drag time constants as short as 10 ^ 4 - 10 ^ 6 seconds, possibly the result of Lorentz-force braking on this planet's hot dayside.
