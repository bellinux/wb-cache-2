5|$|Canada is {{recognized}} as a middle power for its role in international affairs with a tendency to pursue multilateral solutions. Canada's foreign policy based on international peacekeeping and security is carried out through coalitions and international organizations, and through the work of numerous federal institutions. Canada's peacekeeping role during the 20th century <b>has</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> major role in its global image. The strategy of the Canadian government's foreign aid policy reflects an emphasis to meet the Millennium Development Goals, while also providing assistance in response to foreign humanitarian crises.|$|E

5|$|For millennia, archery <b>has</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> {{pivotal role}} in Chinese history. Because the {{cultures}} associated with Chinese society spanned a wide geography and time range, the techniques and equipment associated with Chinese archery are diverse. Historical sources and archaeological evidence suggest {{that a variety of}} bow designs existed throughout Chinese history. For much of the 20th century, only one Chinese traditional bow and arrow making workshop was active. However, {{in the beginning of the}} 21st century, there has been revival in interest among craftsmen looking to construct bows and arrows in the traditional Chinese style.|$|E

5|$|Telecommunication <b>has</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> {{significant}} role in social relationships. Nevertheless, devices like the telephone system were originally advertised {{with an emphasis on}} the practical dimensions of the device (such as the ability to conduct business or order home services) as opposed to the social dimensions. It was not until the late 1920s and 1930s that the social dimensions of the device became a prominent theme in telephone advertisements. New promotions started appealing to consumers' emotions, stressing the importance of social conversations and staying connected to family and friends.|$|E
5|$|Television <b>has</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> {{major role}} {{in the history of the}} Premier League. The League's {{decision}} to assign broadcasting rights to BSkyB in 1992 was at the time a radical decision, but one that has paid off. At the time pay television was an almost untested proposition in the UK market, as was charging fans to watch live televised football. However, a combination of Sky's strategy, the quality of Premier League football and the public's appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League's TV rights soar.|$|E

5|$|The Quancard family <b>has</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> role in {{the life}} and history of Cubzac-les-Ponts. Firstly, Jean Quancard was elected by {{absolute}} majority as mayor of Cubzac on May 15, 1892 and remained in office for 27 years. Also, a fair, organised annually from 1936 to 1939 for its success, supported restoration work for the Saint-Julien steeple and provided financial help to the priest. Finally, the owners periodically host events, including expositions, family weddings and family reunions. The last family reunion, from May 2006, saw approximately 200 members of the Quancard family.|$|E
5|$|The Sudan women's {{national}} football team is an unofficial, non-Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) recognised team called The Challenge that {{plays in a}} domestic competition in Khartoum against teams wearing traditional Muslim garb.

The development of a national team faces several challenges common to much of Africa, along with Sudan-specific issues such as religion. There is an additional problem of a fatwa banning the creation of women's teams.|$|E

5|$|The salt-tolerant {{mangrove}} margin {{has expanded}} inland as freshwater {{flow into the}} bay has been channelized, replacing freshwater sawgrass marshes. The L-31E coastal storm surge levee inland of the park's western boundary <b>has</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> significant role in isolating former freshwater marshlands from their water sources. At the same time, tidal water does not reach {{the interior of the}} coastal margin, limiting interchange between salt and freshwater ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|The walrus <b>has</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> {{prominent}} role in the cultures of many indigenous Arctic peoples, who have hunted the walrus for its meat, fat, skin, tusks, and bone. During the 19th century and the early 20th century, walruses were widely hunted and killed for their blubber, walrus ivory, and meat. The population of walruses dropped rapidly all around the Arctic region. Their population has rebounded somewhat since then, though the populations of Atlantic and Laptev walruses remain fragmented and at low levels compared with the time before human interference.|$|E
