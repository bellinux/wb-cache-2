5|$|Commercial sealing was {{historically}} <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> whaling industry. Exploited species included harp seals, hooded seals, Caspian seals, elephant seals, walruses and {{all species}} of fur seal. The scale of seal harvesting decreased substantially after the 1960s, after the Canadian government reduced {{the length of}} the hunting season and implemented measures to protect adult females. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, Antarctic fur seals may be as numerous as they were prior to harvesting. The northern elephant seal was hunted to near extinction in the late 19th century, with only a small population remaining on Guadalupe Island. It has since recolonized much of its historic range, but has a population bottleneck. Conversely, the Mediterranean monk seal was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea and northwest Africa, and only remains in the northeastern Mediterranean and some parts of northwest Africa.|$|E

25|$|The {{political}} {{effects of}} the Marshall Plan may have been <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> economic ones. Marshall Plan aid allowed the nations of Western Europe to relax austerity measures and rationing, reducing discontent and bringing political stability. The communist influence on Western Europe was greatly reduced, and throughout the region communist parties faded in popularity {{in the years after}} the Marshall Plan. The trade relations fostered by the Marshall Plan helped forge the North Atlantic alliance that would persist throughout the Cold War. At the same time, the nonparticipation of the states of the Eastern Bloc {{was one of the first}} clear signs that the continent was now divided.|$|E

Yet, the total image, {{greater than the sum}} of the parts of which it is composed, now resides {{in the mind of the}} beholder. The dynamism of form implicit or explicit in the quantitative and qualitative properties of the work, set in motion by the artist, could be reassembled and understood in a dynamic process no longer solely restricted to the artist and subject matter.|$|E

500|$|Blues {{had been}} around a long time before it became a part of the first {{explosion}} of recorded popular music in American history. This came in the 1920s, when classic female blues singers like Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith and Mamie Smith grew very popular; the first hit of this field was Mamie Smith's [...] "Crazy Blues". [...] These urban blues singers changed the idea of popular music from being simple songs that could be easily performed by anyone to works primarily associated with an individual singer. [...] Performers like Sophie Tucker, known for [...] "Some of These Days", became closely associated with their hits, making their individualized interpretations <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> song itself.|$|E
500|$|The {{staff of}} Parks and Recreation {{conceived}} {{the idea that}} Ron Swanson had his birthdate redacted from all government documents early {{in the development of}} the series, and it eventually developed into the subplot featured in [...] "Eagleton" [...] where Leslie finds out about his birthday and plans a surprise for him. Michael Schur, co-creator of the series, said the scene when Leslie surprises Ron with a quiet evening alone was his favorite scene in the show. During the scene, Leslie and Ron declare their mutual admiration for one another. Schur said it was difficult to make such an outwardly emotional scene effective in a comedy, but he believed it ultimately worked because of Amy Poehler and Nick Offerman's strong performances. Poehler said of the scene: [...] "It's really sweet and it's just an example of how it's important to Leslie who she works with. It's <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> job itself. I completely relate to that." [...] Rashida Jones also praised the scene, which she said made her cry during a cast read-through of the script.|$|E

She believed school had become a place where social life mattered more than the academics. The experience outside of the classroom had become <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> academics. Despite her attitude that school should be a place for learning, away from social distractions, Lloyd still maintained an idealistic view on the world and education. In a speech given to the National Association of Deans of Women from January, 1944 she stated, [...] "Education must be inspired by courageous and spiritual leadership and must touch the hearts of people as well as train their minds." [...] Additionally, in a speech given at the American Legion Auxiliary Services on August 16, 1945, she said, [...] "It is through generosity and compassion and honesty and love that we will build a new world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Right upon {{setting up}} camp in Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, Romanian troops joined the Wehrmacht and the Schutzstaffel-organized Einsatzgruppen in mass shootings of Bessarabian and Ukrainian Jews, {{resulting}} {{in the deaths of}} 10,000 to 20,000 people. Scholar Christopher R. Browning compares these killings with similar atrocities perpetrated by locals in Reichskommissariat Ukraine, Lithuania and Latvia (see Holocaust in Latvia, Holocaust in Lithuania, Holocaust in Ukraine). From then on, as the fighting troops progressed over the Dniester, the local administration deported large numbers of Jews into the fighting zone, in hopes that they would be exterminated by the Germans. Antonescu himself stated: [...] "I am in favor of expelling the Jews from Bessarabia and [...] Bukovina {{to the other side of}} the border [...] There is nothing for them to do here and I don't mind if we appear in history as barbarians [...] There has never been a time more suitable in our history to get rid of the Jews, and if necessary, you are to make use of machine guns against them." [...] He also explained that his aim was: [...] "the policy of purification of the Romanian race, and I will not give way before any obstacle in achieving this historical goal of our nation. If we do not take advantage of the situation which presents itself today [...] we shall miss the last chance that history offers to us. And I do not wish to miss it, because if I do so further generations will blame me." [...] He made a contradictory statement about the murder of Jews in Chișinău, claiming that their perpetrators were [...] "bastards" [...] who [...] "stained" [...] his regime's reputation. Antonescu saw the [...] "war" [...] against the Jews as being <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> war against the Soviet Union, and regularly demanded reports from his officers in Bessarabia and Transnistria about their measures against the Jews. In late August 1941 in Tighina Antonescu called a secret conference attended by himself, the governors of Bessarabia and Bukovina and the governor-designate of Transnistria to discuss his plans regarding the Jews in those regions.|$|E

This highlights the complicated nature of working with technical translation. Various cultures can exhibit drastic differences in how communication occurs, even when both cultures are working with the same target language.

Encountering discrepancies in rhetorical writing strategies, differentiation in tones, document formatting issues, and conflicting conceptual goals for engineering reports, the author emphasizes cultural practices, outside of the direct realm of linguistic forms, that can impede proper communication in technical translation.|$|R
