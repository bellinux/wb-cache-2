40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) first Air Traffic Management (ATM) Technology Demonstration (ATD- 1) {{was created}} to {{facilitate}} the transition of mature ATM technologies from the laboratory to operational use. The technologies selected for demonstration are the Traffic Management Advisor with Terminal Metering (TMA-TM), which provides precise time-based scheduling in the Terminal airspace; Controller Managed Spacing (CMS), which provides controllers with decision support tools to enable precise schedule conformance; and Interval Management (IM), which consists of flight deck automation that enables aircraft to achieve or maintain precise spacing behind another aircraft. Recent simulations and IM algorithm development at NASA have focused on trajectory-based IM operations where aircraft equipped with IM avionics are expected to achieve a spacing goal, assigned by air traffic controllers, at the final approach fix. The recently published IM Minimum Operational Performance Standards describe five types of IM operations. This paper discusses the results and conclusions of a human-in-the-loop simulation that investigated three of those IM operations. The results {{presented in this paper}} focus on system performance and integration metrics. Overall, the IM operations conducted in this simulation integrated well with ground-based decisions support tools and certain types of IM operational were able to provide improved spacing precision at the final approach fix; however, some issues were identified that should be addressed prior to implementing <b>IM</b> <b>procedures</b> into real-world operations...|$|R
40|$|Interval Management (IM) is one NexGen {{method for}} {{achieving}} airspace efficiencies. In order to initiate <b>IM</b> <b>procedures,</b> Air Traffic Control provides an IM clearance to the IM aircraft's pilots that indicates an intended spacing from another aircraft (the target to follow - or TTF) {{and the point}} at which this should be achieved. Pilots enter the clearance in the flight deck IM (FIM) system; and once the TTF's Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast signal is available, the FIM algorithm generates target speeds to meet that IM goal. This study examined four Avionics Conditions (defined by the instrumentation and location presenting FIM information) and three Notification Methods (defined by the visual and aural alerts that notified pilots to IM-related events). Current commercial pilots flew descents into Dallas/Fort-Worth in a high-fidelity commercial flight deck simulation environment with realistic traffic and communications. All 12 crews experienced each Avionics Condition, where order was counterbalanced over crews. Each crew used only one of the three Notification Methods. This paper presents results from eye tracking data collected from both pilots, including: normalized number of samples falling within FIM displays, normalized heads-up time, noticing time, dwell time on first FIM display look after a new speed, a workload-related metric, and a measure comparing the scan paths of pilot flying and pilot monitoring; and discusses these in the context of other objective (vertical and speed profile deviations, response time to dial in commanded speeds, out-of-speed-conformance and reminder indications) and subjective measures (workload, situation awareness, usability, and operational acceptability) ...|$|R

A few equations are necessary in order to derive the IS curve: ā = āc + āi + āg + āex - āim - 1, and Ỹt = (Yt - Ȳt) / Ȳt = (Yt / Ȳt) - (Ȳt / Ȳt) = (Yt / Ȳt) - 1.

40|$|The present {{research}} work {{is directed to}} study of some controllers for design, modelling, simulation and RTDS implementation of induction motor (IM) drive system to identify suitable controller for high performance. Initially dynamic modelling and simulation of a feedback linearization scheme for high performance IM drive is carried out. The flux measurement required in this scheme is achieved using flux estimator rather sensor to simplify the system. The complexity and calculation involved in reference frame transformation is taken care by implementing the scheme in stationary reference frame. Two linear and independent subsystems: (i) Electrical and (ii) Mechanical are created by linearizing control scheme. The systematic design of closed loop control scheme using Proportional Integral (PI) controller is developed for implementation. To take care of uncertainties in the system the Fuzzy controller is added to speed controller. Sliding Mode (SM) controller {{considered to be a}} robust control strategy is designed and developed for <b>IM</b> drive. A <b>procedure</b> of finding gain and bandwidth of the controller is developed to take care of model inaccuracies, load disturbances and rotor resistance variation. During practical implementation of this controller for IM leads to oscillations and of state variable chattering due to presence of limiter and PWM inverter in the system. Iterative Learning controller (ILC) introduced in recent time is gaining popularity due to capability to take care of short comings of Sliding Mode controller. Feedback and feed forward Iterative Learning controller combining fuzzy logic is designed and developed.

Trade levels enter the estimation in logs, whereas “trade first differences” are calculated as the rate of year-to-year changes in percentage. We also add lagged trade variables (lagged by 1  year) to allow for a more deferred adjustment process. Note that, overall, the coefficients of worker and job characteristics do not change in a qualitative manner in these different specifications, nor do the GAV and ICT coefficients (except for the low skill level as a consequence of its interaction with the trade variables). We find some evidence (on the 5 % significance level) for a significant effect of import levels on the probability of becoming unemployed for low-skilled employees: A 1 % higher import value is associated with a 0.017 % (0.016 % for lagged imports) higher probability of becoming unemployed. In other words, low-skilled individuals who work in industries characterized by relatively large contemporaneous imports may, ceteris paribus, face a slightly greater likelihood of becoming unemployed. As shown in the fourth and fifth columns of Table  2, no significant effects are found for first differences (i.e. changes) in import and export values: A change in imports or exports in a certain industry does not significantly affect the probability of becoming unemployed.|$|R

40|$|The Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB) {{now offers}} a {{complete}} door-to-door parcel service, {{combined with other}} logistical services ("ExpressCargo"). In doing so, they have intensified competition with private haulage contractors. By contrast, the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) and the German Railway (DB) abandoned this line of business {{at the end of}} 1996 and the end of 1997, respectively, owing to insufficient earnings. DB and SBB now concentrate their activities on the core sectors of rail transport and have withdrawn from services which are also offered on competitive markets. The ÖBB, on the other hand, pursue a strategy of extending their operations with the goal of raising the utilization of existing capacities. With regard to the parcel service, the government payments to the ÖBB might distort competition between the ÖBB's "ExpressCargo" and the general rail shipment provided by private haulage contractors. In 1997, the federal government paid ATS 16. 4 billion to the ÖBB to reimburse the ÖBB for the costs of operating the railtrack and of expanding the railroad infrastructure {{as well as for the}} costs of providing public services. These payments are covered by the general social consensus in Austria and are intended to help the "environmentally friendly" railways compete with road transportation. The environment argument is, however, irrelevant for competition between "ExpressCargo" and general rail shipment provided by haulage contractors because these services do not differ in their impact on the environment. Market distortions my also result from the enterprise structure of the ÖBB. The ÖBB are a vertically integrated firm, with activities ranging from the operation of the infrastructure to rail transport, to logistic services. The ÖBB, moreover, have the monopoly of "environmentally friendly" rail transport. A vertically integrated firm is likely to support strategically important lines of activity if this support is necessary for strengthening its overall market position or maximizing profits. Such cross subsidies are, however, problematic for the entire economy, if such subsidies are drawn from monopoly rents and from business activities subsidized by the government. In this particular case, the possibility should be ruled out that the competitive position of "ExpressCargo" vis-à-vis the competing haulage contractors is strengthened by cross subsidies and that the ÖBB render access to rail services more difficult to competing rail parcel services. Monitoring of the infrastructure balance sheets and of the use of funds for public services by public accountants and the Ministry for Science and Transportation may reveal undesirable cross subsidies and market distortions ex post. The establishment of independent enterprises for the business segments of rail infrastructure, transportation, and logistic would, however, rule out market distortions <b>ex</b> ante.

Apoptose in der durch Hyperlipidämie induzierten Atherosklerose: In Aorten von 'Froxfield Heritable Hypercholesterolemic'-Kaninchen (genetische Hyperlipidämie) korrelierte die Apoptose von vaskulären glatten Muskelzellen und Makrophagen in fortgeschrittenen fibrösen Plaques mit einem 18 -fachen Anstieg des proapoptotischen Bax. In Aorten Cholesterin gefütterter 'New Zealand White'-Kaninchen (0, 25 % Cholest., 12 Wochen) konnte eine erhöhte Baxexpression in Endothelzellen nachgewiesen werden, ohne daß morphologische Veränderungen zu beobachten waren. Die Apoptose in akut abgestoßenen allogenen Herztransplantaten (Rattenmodell) war von einer erhöhten Bax-Expression und einer totalen, posttranslationalen Degradation des antiapoptotischen Bcl- 2 in ein spezifisches Degradationsprodukt durch eine Serinprotease gekennzeichnet. Die Rolle des wichtigen kardiovaskulären Mediators Stickstoffmonoxid (NO) auf die Apoptose wird kontrovers diskutiert. Da in der Zellkultur protektive Effekte von NO gezeigt werden konnten, wurde deren physiologische Relevanz in der durch Ischämie/Reperfusion induzierten Apoptose <b>ex</b> vivo <b>im</b> Langendorff-Rattenherzen untersucht. Es konnte gezeigt werden, daß Hemmung der endogenen NO-Synthese mit L-NG-Monomethyl-L-Arginin (LNMMA, 1 mM) die Apoptose potenzierte und mit einer Aktivierung der Caspase- 3 korrelierte. Bcl- 2 und Bax wurden nicht reguliert. Untersuchung der Regulation der Proteinexpression der eNOS (endotheliale NO-Synthase) durch den proinflammatorischen/ proatherogenen Tumor-Nekrose-Faktor-[Alpha] (TNF[Alpha]) in der Endothelzellkultur (HUVEC) gaben Hinweise auf einen, die eNOS schützenden, Interaktionspartner. Zusammenfassend konnte in allen untersuchten Modellen für Herz(-Kreislauf) -Krankheiten Apoptose nachgewiesen werden, die jeweils spezifische Charakteristika zeigt, deren genauere Aufklärung interessante Ziele zukünftiger präventiver und therapeutischer Maßnahmen verspricht. Die Befunde weisen zudem auf antiapoptotische Effekte von NO - insbesondere durch die endotheliale NO-Synthaseaktivität - hin, deren genauere Charakterisierung dazu beitragen könnte, pathophysiologische Zustände der kardiovaskulären Biologie zu erklären. Apoptosis is a {{distinct}} form of cell death that has been under intensive investigations {{in the past few}} years. Many signalling pathways were elucidated in cell-free systems or in intact cells. But only little is known about apoptosis in cardiac and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate apoptosis in various cardiac diseases: in hyperlipidemia induced atherosclerosis, in acute rejected heart transplants, in ischemia and reperfusion as well as in chronic hypoxia. Atherosclerosis is the main contributor to myocardial infarction. Also hyperlipidemia is a known major risk factor. To investigate apoptosis in hyperlipidemia induced atherosclerosis, genetically induced hyperlipidemia in Froxfield Heritable Hypercholesterolemic Rabbits (FFH, n= 8) was compared with New Zealand White rabbits either fed with a cholesterol diet (H, n= 8, 0, 25 % cholesterol, 3 % coconut oil) or with a normal diet (control, n= 5) for 12 weeks. To determine apoptosis DNA-laddering and immunohistochemical TUNEL-stainings were performed. In advanced fibrous plaques of FFH rabbits apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and macrophages (M|os) correlated with a drastic 18 -fold increased expression of proapoptotic Bax. The antiapoptotic protein Bcl- 2 remained unchanged. In conclusion, apoptosis in advanced plaques seems to be a double edged sword: apoptosis of VSMCs may lead to plaque rupture due to diminished collagen synthesis and following myocardial infarction. In contrast, apoptosis of M|o could induce plaque stabilisation. Cholesterol diet did not induce morphological changes of the aortas in spite of elevated serum cholesterol. A doubling of Bax expression was observed in endothelial cells, indicating the induction of apoptosis in this cell type. Apoptosis of endothelial cells could be an initial manifestation leading to endothelial dysfunction and subsequent plaque development. The increased expression of Bax seems to correlate with elevated Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) levels in both models underlining the induction of apoptosis by elevated serum LDL. Heart transplantation is a common therapeutical option in the terminal stages of heart failure. The most important complications are acute rejection and chronic vasculopathy of the transplants. To investigate apoptosis as an effector mechanism of acute rejection, the model of allogenic heart transplantation from Wistar Furth to Lewis rats (n = 15) was used. These hearts were rejected from 6 to 10 days after transplantation. Apoptosis in acute rejected heart transplants was characterised by an enhanced (3 -fold) expression of Bax. Bcl- 2 was completely degraded into a specific degradation product of about 17 kD. An RNase protection assay with multiple probes revealed no transcriptional changes of mRNA levels in acute rejected compared to control hearts. The posttranscriptional degradation of Bcl- 2 was further analysed in a radioactive assay in vitro. The involvement of a serine protease which is sensitive to nitric oxide (NO) and dithiotreitol (DTT) was eludicated. Apoptosis and in particular the elevated ratio of proapoptotic Bax to antiapoptotic Bcl- 2 could be responsible for transplant rejection. In addition, the degradation of Bcl- 2 could also contribute to transplant rejection probably due to diminished antiapoptotic Bcl- 2 levels or by producing an apoptotic degradation fragment. Myocardial infarction is either a consequence of atherosclerotic vessel occlusion or of transplantation. Typically it is accompanied by a loss of cardiomyocytes. Ischemia/ reperfusion is an accepted model for myocardial infarction. To investigate apoptosis in ischemia/reperfusion, hearts from male Wistar Furth rats were perfused ex vivo in a Langendorff apparatus (n= 6 per group; 30 minutes equilibration, 30 min. global ischemia, 30 min. reperfusion). Reperfusion, but not ischemia alone induced apoptosis. Apoptosis was accompanied by the activation of caspase- 3, a member of the apoptosis inducing caspase-cascade (as determined by western blotting and a radioactive assay in vitro). In contrast to acute hypoxia in ischemia, chronic hypoxia in Wistar Furth rats (21 days 10 % O 2, n= 4) resulted in apoptosis of the hearts which was characterised by a doubling of proapoptotic Bax and a halffold reduction of antiapoptotic Bcl- 2. Thus the enhanced ratio of Bax to Bcl- 2 could be responsible for apoptosis in chronic hypoxia. Myocardial diseases are often accompanied by a reduction of endogenous nitric oxide. The role of nitric oxide in apoptosis is discussed controversially. The physiological relevance of antiapoptotic NO-effects was demonstrated in ischemia/ reperfusion experiments. Inhibiting the endogenous NO-synthase in ischemia/reperfusion with its competitive inhibitor L-NG-Monomethyl-L-arginine (LNMMA, 1 mM) potentiated apoptosis. In addition, caspase- 3 was activated suggesting protective effects of the endogenous NO production due to an inhibiting interference with caspase- 3. These results were underlined by the observations that hearts of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) -knockout-mice (n= 2 per group) showed apoptosis, which correlated with an elevated Bax expression. All taken together, apoptosis was demonstrated in all models under investigation. Apoptosis shows specific characteristic features in the distinct cardiac/cardiovascular diseases providing future targets for prevention and therapy. Proatherosclerotic and proinflammatoric factors are known to inhibit endogenous NO release. Therefore, the regulation of eNOS protein synthesis in response to tumour necrosis factor [Alpha] (TNF[Alpha]) in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX, an inhibitor of protein synthesis) was analysed in human umbilical vein endothelial cell cultures (HUVEC). The apoptotic stimuli TNF[Alpha]/CHX resulted in the proteolysis of eNOS. The diminished eNOS protein levels were accompanied by a reduced enzyme activity suggesting an antiapoptotic function of the endogenous NO synthesis. Inhibition of the proteasome with ZLLLH, a proteasome-specific inhibitor, only reversed eNOS proteolysis induced by TNF[Alpha]/CHX indicating the involvement of a protein which is interacting with eNOS. eNOS itself seems not to be degraded by the proteasome, because ZLLLH had no effect on TNF[Alpha] induced degradation. In conclusion, these results suggest the presence of a protective eNOS associated protein which is degraded by TNF/CHX leading to a subsequent degradation of eNOS. The chaperone Hsp 90 could be such an eNOS interacting protein. However, in our system we could not observe a significant role of HSP 70 or Caveolin- 1 in eNOS degradation. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed the involvement of an eNOS interacting protein of around 70 kD molecular weight. This protein has still to be identified. In summary, nitric oxide, especially derived from eNOS, seems to be protective against apoptotic cell death. Elucidating the mechanisms leading to a decreased NO production by the eNOS could help to explain pathological disorders of the cardiovascular biology...|$|R
40|$|The only {{available}} vaccine against TB  the Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine  provides reliable protection against severe manifestations of childhood TB, but not against pulmonary tuberculosis in adults. Despite many attempts, no improved alternative TB vaccine has been fully licensed so far. It may be crucial for future vaccine development to gain further knowledge on the stimulatory antigens of this vaccine strain and their elicited immune responses. The {{aim of the}} current study was to investigate the BCG-mediated adaptive immune responses directed against lipid preparations (chloroform-methanol extracts, CMEs) of bacteria of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC). To this end, the BCG-sensitized guinea pig was employed as a model for human BCG vaccination. In particular, the present study addressed whether lipopeptides in the CME preparations constitute relevant stimulatory antigens for adaptive cellular immune responses upon BCG sensitization and whether the expression of stimulatory lipid antigens varies across the genus Mycobacterium. It was further attempted to identify the molecular nature of the stimulatory antigens present in CME. Outbred Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs were sensitized with BCG or, for comparison purposes, with heat-inactivated wet mass of the virulent M. bovis strain AN 5. Ex vivo, the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was investigated in a CFSE-based proliferation assay which was subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry. In this assay, CMEs of M. bovis BCG and M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv and, in addition, a Kochs Old Tuberculin standard were used as antigenic stimuli. The molecular nature of the relevant stimulatory antigens within these preparations was investigated by means of delipidation and protease treatment. Furthermore, the stimulatory potentials of a lipopeptide-enriched subfraction of CME(H 37 Rv) (LppEL), of a defined mycobacterial protein antigen (AG 85 A), and of different BCG preparations (live or heat-inactivated bacteria, bacterial lysates derived from BCG cultures in the exponential {{as well as in the}} static growth phase, and culture supernatant) were tested for their stimulatory potentials in the ex vivo lymphocyte proliferation assay. A restimulation assay based on the antigen-specific expansion of ex vivo lymphocytes, the sorting for expanded lymphocytes and the restimulation of these cells, was established in this study and served subsequently for determination of the antigen-specificity of the stimulated lymphocytes as well as for investigating the distribution of the stimulatory antigens among the tested preparations (Tuberculin, CME(BCG), CME(H 37 Rv), LppEL). The distribution of the stimulatory antigens was further analyzed among the genus Mycobacterium using CMEs of several MTC strains, including clinical ones, (M. bovis AN 5, M. tuberculosis CDC 1551, Haarlem 2336, HN 878, Beijing 1934, East African-Indian strains 1797 and 91 / 0079, M. canetti) and of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) (M. marinum, M. avium ssp. avium and M. avium ssp. paratuberculosis, M. leprae, M. fortuitum). It was attempted to identify the molecular nature of the stimulatory antigens in the lipid preparations by two complementary approaches: the purification of lipopeptides from enriched antigen preparations by means of reversed phase chromatography and the investigation of the stimulatory potentials of synthetic, N-terminal peptides of M. tuberculosis lipoproteins. Flowcytometric analysis of the ex vivo lymphocyte proliferation assay revealed that guinea pigs mount strong, adaptive lymphocyte responses upon sensitization with both BCG and inactivated, virulent M. bovis AN 5. The lymphocytes proliferated upon stimulation with CME preparations of M. bovis BCG and M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv. The CME(BCG) -stimulated proliferation manifested in a similar range as lymphocyte responses elicited by tuberculin with the median proliferation being represented by ~ 45 % CFSE-low lymphocytes in BCG-sensitized guinea pigs. This proliferation was significantly stronger than the lymphocyte responses to the defined mycobacterial protein antigen AG 85 A (p &# 8804; 0. 0001, students t test). The above-mentioned preparations of BCG bacteria, however, stimulated strong proliferation as well (significantly above 20 % CFSElow cells, p &# 8804; 0. 001, one-sample t test). The CME(BCG) -responding lymphocytes were predominantly (~ 83 %) CD 4 -positive T cells. Delipidation as well as protease treatment of CME(BCG) decreased the stimulatory capacities significantly (p &# 8804; 0. 0001, students t test) to median levels below 20 % CFSE-low cells. The same effect on the ex vivo lymphocyte proliferation was observed upon delipidation as well as proteinase K treatment of tuberculin. Furthermore, when stimulating the ex vivo PBMCs with a lipopeptide-enriched subfraction of CME(H 37 Rv) (LppEL), the median lymphocyte proliferation manifested similar to the lymphocyte response to the parental CME(H 37 Rv) preparation and both proliferative responses were positively correlated (r = 0. 64, Spearman correlation). Using the restimulation assay, it could be confirmed that the proliferated T cells responded specifically to antigens present in tuberculin, CME(BCG) and CME(H 37 Rv), as well as in LppEL. Strong proliferative responses (on average significantly above 20 % CFSE-low cells, p &# 8804; 0. 05, one-sample t test) were, however, only observed in response to CME preparations of MTC bacteria. In contrast, the average proliferative response to CME preparations of NTM did not exceed the 20 % cut-off significantly (p > 0. 05). So far, it was not possible to identify single lipopeptides which accounted for the observed, strong lymphocyte proliferation. However, it is remarkable that some synthetic N-terminal peptides of M. tuberculosis lipoproteins (LprG, PstS 3, LppW, LprL, Pitlp, and LppD) stimulated stronger lymphocyte proliferation on average in the group or in individual guinea pigs. The results demonstrate that the guinea pig is well-suited to investigate adaptive immune responses elicited by MTC bacteria and, in particular, it is a good model to investigate BCG vaccination in a defined experimental setting. All findings were in full accordance with the observations in M. tuberculosis-infected humans. Strong evidence for the stimulatory potential and the relevance of lipopeptides in CME preparations was provided by three independent immunological approaches. Moreover, it could be demonstrated that lipopeptides account for a majority of the stimulatory capacities not only of CME, but also of Kochs Old Tuberculin. The extensive expression and the release of strong antigens, such as the putative lipopeptides, by BCG is supported by the data. Furthermore, the putative stimulatory lipopeptides must be specifically expressed or cross-recognized within the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, but only rarely in non-tuberculous mycobacteria. However, the identification of single strong lipopeptide antigens requires further investigation. In this line, it must be considered that antigen mixtures of several single, strong lipopeptide antigens, whose existence has been suggested by the present results, might be necessary to elicit similar strong lymphocyte responses as observed upon stimulation with complex, lipopeptide-containing antigen mixtures such as CME. Der einzige, verfügbare Impfstoff gegen Tuberkulose  der Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) - Impfstoff  schützt verlässlich vor schweren Formen der Tuberkulose im Kindesalter, aber nicht vor Lungentuberkulose bei Erwachsenen. Trotz vieler Versuche konnte bisher noch kein verbesserter, alternativer TB-Impfstoff zugelassen werden. Für die zukünftige Impfstoff- entwicklung kann der weitere Erkenntnisgewinn über die stimulatorischen Antigene dieses Impfstammes und die durch sie hervorgerufenen Immunantworten entscheidend sein. Das Ziel der hier beschriebenen Studie war die Untersuchung der BCG-vermittelten adaptiven Immunantwort, die sich gegen Lipidpräparationen (Chloroform-Methanol-Extrakte, CME) von Bakterien des Mycobacterium tuberculosis-Komplexes (MTC) richtet. Mit BCG sensibilisierte Meerschweinchen wurden als Modell für die BCG-Impfung im Menschen eingesetzt. Die hier vorliegende Studie befasst sich im Speziellen mit der Frage, ob Lipopeptide in CME-Präparationen relevante stimulatorische Antigene für die adaptive, zelluläre Immunantwort nach BCG-Impfung darstellen und ob die Expression von stimulatorischen Lipidantigenen innerhalb des Genus Mycobacterium variiert. Eine weitere Intention war, die molekulare Struktur der stimulatorischen Antigene in CME zu identifizieren. Auszucht-Dunkin-Hartley-Meerschweinchen wurden mit BCG oder  zu Vergleichszwecken  mit hitze-inaktivierter Feuchtmasse des virulenten M. bovis-Stamms AN 5 sensibilisiert. Die ex vivo Proliferation von mononukleären Zellen aus dem peripheren Blut (peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMCs) wurde in einem auf CFSE-Färbung basierenden Proliferations- assay untersucht, der mittels Durchflusszytometrie analysiert wurde. In diesem Assay wurden CMEs von M. bovis BCG und M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv sowie zusätzlich ein Kochscher Alttuberkulin-Standard als antigene Stimuli verwendet. Die Untersuchung der molekularen Struktur der relevanten, stimulatorischen Antigene in diesen Präparationen erfolgte mit Hilfe von Delipidierung und Protease-Behandlung. Darüber hinaus wurden die stimulatorischen Potenziale von einer Lipopeptid-angereicherten CME(H 37 Rv) -Subfraktion (LppEL), einem definierten, mykobakteriellen Protein-Antigen (AG 85 A) und verschiedenen BCG-Präparationen (lebende oder Hitze-inaktivierte Bakterien, bakterielle Lysate von BCG-Kulturen in der exponentiellen als auch in der statischen Wachstumsphase, Kulturüberstand) <b>im</b> <b>ex</b> vivo-Lymphozytenproliferationsassay getestet.
