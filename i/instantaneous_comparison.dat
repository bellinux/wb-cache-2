50|$|Fault {{detection}} for a {{horde of}} industrial robots experiences similar difficulties as lack of fault detection models and dynamic operating condition. Industrial robots are crucial in automotive manufacturing and perform different tasks as welding, material handling, painting, etc. In this scenario, robotic maintenance becomes critical to ensure continuous production and avoid downtime. Historically, the fault detection models for all the industrial robots are trained similarly. Critical model parameters like training samples, components, and alarming limits are set {{the same for all}} the units regardless of their different functionalities. Even though these identical fault detection models can effectively identify faults sometimes, numerous false alarms discourage users from trusting the reliability of the system. However, within a machine network, industrial robots with similar tasks or working regimes can be group together; the abnormal units in a cluster can then be prioritized for maintenance via training based or <b>instantaneous</b> <b>comparison.</b> This peer to peer comparison methodology inside a machine network could improve the fault detection accuracy significantly.|$|E

40|$|Recently, the SPIKE-distance {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a parameter-free and time-scale independent measure of spike train synchrony. This measure is time-resolved since it relies on instantaneous estimates of spike train dissimilarity. However, its original definition led to spuriously high instantaneous values for event-like firing patterns. Here we present a substantial improvement of this measure which eliminates this shortcoming. The reliability gained allows us to track changes in instantaneous clustering, i. e., time-localized patterns of (dis) similarity among multiple spike trains. Additional new features include selective and triggered temporal averaging {{as well as the}} <b>instantaneous</b> <b>comparison</b> of spike train groups. In a second step, a causal SPIKE-distance is defined such that the instantaneous values of dissimilarity rely on past information only so that time-resolved spike train synchrony can be estimated in real-time. We demonstrate that these methods are capable of extracting valuable information from field data by monitoring the synchrony between neuronal spike trains during an epileptic seizure. Finally, the applicability of both the regular and the real-time SPIKE-distance to continuous data is illustrated on model electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings.

40|$|The paper {{approaches}} {{different aspects}} inherent to the multifaceted task of semi-actively controlling the three-dimensional dynamics of a frame structure through interstorey chevron braces embedding smart dampers. The control strategy is finalized {{to mitigate the}} latero-torsional motion of a large-scaled laboratory prototype, which experimentally simulates the seismic response of a two-storey building. A synthetic discrete model is purposely formulated in the reduced space of a few significant dynamic variables, and consistently updated to match the modal properties identified from the experimental response of the uncontrolled prototype. The potential occurrence of significant eccentricity in the storey mass distribution, breaking the global structural symmetry, is considered. The control action is introduced by two magneto-rheological dampers, whose dissipative properties can be modified in real-time, supplying an opportune magnetic field. The suited adjustment of the damper characteristic is governed by a clipped-optimal control law, which entails the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>comparison</b> of the actual force with the active force evaluated through a non-collocated acceleration feedback designed according to the LQG method. Since the dampers are positioned purposely to deliver two eccentric and independent forces, acting on the first-storey displacements, the set-up allows the mitigation of the three-dimensional motion arising when monodirectional ground motion is imposed on the non-symmetric structure. Numerical investigations on the model controlled response to different natural accelerograms are presented. The effectiveness of the control strategy is discussed through synthetic performance indexes. Comments on the real effectiveness of the control strategy in mitigating the experimental response of the prototype are drawn, based on the promising results of a test campaign.

40|$|Many {{remote sensing}} {{techniques}} and passive sensors {{have been developed}} to measure global aerosol properties. While <b>instantaneous</b> <b>comparisons</b> between pixel-level data often reveal quantitative differences, here we use Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis, also known as Principal Component Analysis, to demonstrate that satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) data sets exhibit essentially the same spatial and temporal variability and are thus suitable for large-scale studies. Analysis results show that the first four EOF modes of AOD account for the bulk of the variance and agree well across the four data sets used in this study (i. e., Aqua MODIS, Terra MODIS, MISR, and SeaWiFS). Only SeaWiFS data over land have slightly different EOF patterns. Globally, the first two EOF modes show annual cycles and are mainly related to Sahara dust in the northern hemisphere and biomass burning in the southern hemisphere, respectively. After removing the mean seasonal cycle from the data, major aerosol sources, including biomass burning in South America and dust in West Africa, are revealed in the dominant modes due to the different interannual variability of aerosol emissions. The enhancement of biomass burning associated with El Nio over Indonesia and central South America is also captured with the EOF technique...|$|R

Both CALIOP and MODIS {{are part of}} the NASA A-Train constellation of satellites and provide continuous near-coincident measurements that result in over 28 million cloud detection comparisons and over 5 million CTH comparisons for the months of August 2006 and February 2007. To facilitate the comparison, a computationally efficient and accurate collocation methodology is developed. With the collocated MODIS and CALIOP retrievals, nearly <b>instantaneous</b> <b>comparisons</b> are compiled regionally and globally.

Consumers are rarely in isotopic equilibrium with their food sources, so <b>instantaneous</b> <b>comparisons</b> between the d 15 N of a consumer and its diet provide little information about trophic variation, even if the trophic positions of the diet are known. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} trophic link between zooplankton and planktivorous fish. We first review the extent of temporal variability of zooplankton d 15 N, then examine the consequences of this variability for understanding the isotopic composition of planktivorous fish communities. We use time series of d 15 N for Daphnia, calanoid copepods, and particulate organic matter (. 200 mm) to generate theoretical diets for a model juvenile sockeye over a typical growing season. We use a TIM to predict the isotopic trajectory of individual juveniles feeding on these diets and explore how variance in growth rate and isotopic enrichment (DdN) can affect estimates of trophic position and intrapopulation isotopic variability. In general, we found that using a seasonal average of Daphnia d 15 N to estimate the trophic position of planktivorous fish is nearly equivalent to using a TIM. However, temporal variation in the d 15 N of food sources, coupled with individual differences in the growth rate of consumers, can contribute to intra-population isotopic variation of consumers and lead to correlations between consumer size and d 15 N...|$|R

While a companion paper was devoted {{exclusively to the}} description of the algorithm, its strengths, and its limitations, the main focus {{of this paper is to}} report on the results, applicability, and expected accuraciesfrom this algorithm. Some examples are given that compare retrieved results with ground-based radar data from different geographical regions to illustrate the performance and utility of the algorithm under distinct rainfall conditions. More quantitative validation is accomplished using two months of radar data from Darwin, Australia, and the radar network over Japan. <b>Instantaneous</b> <b>comparisons</b> at Darwin indicate that root-mean-square errors for 1. 25 deg areas over water are 0. 09 mm/h compared to the mean rainfall value of 0. 224 mm/h while the correlation exceeds 0. 9.

Results are less encouraging over land with root-mean-square errors somewhat larger than the mean rain rates and correlations of only 0. 71 and 0. 62 for Darwin and Japan, respectively. These validation studies are further used in combination with the theoretical treatment of expected accuracies developed in the companion paper to define error estimates on a broader scale than individual radar sites from which the errors may be analyzed.

40|$|Space-borne {{microwave}} sensors provide critical rain information used {{in several}} global multi-satellite rain products, {{which in turn}} are used {{for a variety of}} important studies, including landslide forecasting, flash flood warning, data assimilation, climate studies, and validation of model forecasts of precipitation. This study employs four years (2003 - 2006) of satellite data to assess the relative performance and skill of SSM/I (F 13, F 14 and F 15), AMSU-B (N 15, N 16 and N 17), AMSR-E (Aqua) and the TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) in estimating surface rainfall based on direct <b>instantaneous</b> <b>comparisons</b> with ground-based rain estimates from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Ground Validation (GV) sites at Kwajalein, Republic of the Marshall Islands (KWAJ) and Melbourne, Florida (MELB). The relative performance of each of these satellite estimates is examined via comparisons with space- and time-coincident GV radar-based rain rate estimates. Because underlying surface terrain is known to affect the relative performance of the satellite algorithms, the data for MELB was further stratified into ocean, land and coast categories using a 0. 25 deg terrain mask. Of all the satellite estimates compared in this study, TMI and AMSR-E exhibited considerably higher correlations and skills in estimating/observing surface precipitation. While SSM/I and AMSU-B exhibited lower correlations and skills for each of the different terrain categories, the SSM/I absolute biases trended slightly lower than AMSR-E over ocean, where the observations from both emission and scattering channels were used in the retrievals. AMSU-B exhibited the least skill relative to GV in all of the relevant statistical categories, and an anomalous spike was observed in the probability distribution functions near 1. 0 mm/hr. This statistical artifact appears to be related to attempts by algorithm developers to include some lighter rain rates, not easily detectable by its scatter-only frequencies. AMSU-B, however, agreed well with GV when the matching data was analyzed on monthly scales. These results signal developers of global rainfall products, such as the TRMM Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA), and the Climate Data Center s Morphing (CMORPH) technique, that care must be taken when incorporating data from these input satellite estimates in order to provide the highest quality estimates in their products...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} level 2 and level 3 {{rainfall}} {{products from the}} Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission gridded distribution of 118 high resolution tipping buckets from the Oklahoma Mesonet. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, a joint satellite mission between NASA and the National Space Development Agency (NASDA) of Japan, was designed to estimate global precipitation between 40 S and 40 N latitude. The TRMM satellite, consisting of two main precipitation sensors, a passive microwave (TMI) and precipitation radar (PR) sensors, was launched in 1997. Although the great advantage of TRMM has been its ability to sample precipitation globally over the tropical oceans in places where ground sensors do not exist, regional points over land still offer the best opportunity for validating these rain estimates. For this study, the gauge data was gridded at I x I degree resolution between 34 and 36 N and - 95 and - 100 W. The location of Oklahoma is somewhat unique, in that, it is located near the turning point for the satellite. This study investigates effects of temporal sampling on the satellite measurements and the resulting rainfall bias observed between space and ground based sensors. The {{first part of the}} study analyzes the monthly rainfall statistics of the 3 AI 2 (TMI), the 3 A 25 (PR) and the 31142 (combined sensors) with the rain gauges. It uses regression techniques and a computation of the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative probability density function (CDF) for each sensor to evaluate the effects of temporal sampling on the satellite products and the sufficiency of using two overpasses a day to estimate rainfall on a monthly scale.

In addition to showing the salient effects of temporal sampling, the study also revisits the historical problem of correlating point gauge estimates with area estimates, though, the problem is ameliorated by averaging and gridding the data to the area resolution scale of the satellite...|$|R

40|$|In {{alpine ski}} racing the {{relationships}} between skier kinetics and kinematics and their effect on performance and injury-related aspects are not well understood. There is currently no validated system to determine all external forces simultaneously acting on skiers, particularly under race conditions and throughout entire races. To address the problem, this study proposes and assesses a method for determining skier kinetics with a single lightweight differential global navigation satellite system (dGNSS). The dGNSS kinetic method was compared to a reference system for six skiers and two turns each. The pattern differences obtained between the measurement systems (offset ± SD) were − 26 ± 152 N for the ground reaction force, 1 ± 96 N for ski friction and − 6 ± 6 N for the air drag force. The differences between turn means were small. The error pattern within the dGNSS kinetic method was highly repeatable and precision was therefore good (SD within system: 63 N ground reaction force, 42 N friction force and 7 N air drag force) allowing <b>instantaneous</b> relative <b>comparisons</b> and identification of discriminative meaningful changes.

40|$|The Park Grass Experiment, {{begun in}} 1856, {{is the oldest}} {{ecological}} experiment in existence. Its value to science has changed and grown since it was founded to answer agricultural questions. In recent times the experiment has shown inter alia how: plant species richness, biomass and pH are related; community composition responds to climatic perturbation and nutrient additions; soil is acidified and corrected by liming. It also provided {{one of the first}} demonstrations of the evolution of adaptation at a very local scale and contains a putative case of the evolution of reproductive isolation by reinforcement. The application of molecular genetic markers to archived plant material promises to reveal a whole new chapter of genetic detail about the long-term dynamics of plant populations. Over the range of values observed at Park Grass, biomass (productivity) has a negative effect upon species richness. Any positive effect of species richness on productivity could only be weak by comparison. The experiment provides support for both the competitive exclusion and pool size hypotheses for determination of species density. <b>Instantaneous</b> <b>comparisons</b> of species richness between plots do not accurately reflect temporal rates of loss which may be multiplicative rather than additive. This suggests that comparisons among sites, nutrient inputs, especially N treatments, or soil acidity may in general underestimate the threat posed to plant species diversity by long-term changes in plant nutrient availability, both enrichment and depletion. Differences between plots at the community level are maintained despite a flow of propagules between plots. There is no strong evidence for a spatial mass effect. Guild (grass/legume/other) compositions of plant communities have equilibrated, but the species composition within guilds is more dynamic and continues to change over time, suggesting that species and guild abundances are independently regulated. At least some members of all the major trophic levels, including predators (spiders), herbivores (leafhoppers) and detritivores (springtails) are treatment-specific in their distributions. Plant populations on Park Grass are subdivided by treatments which, to some degree, have led to plots becoming genetically isolated from one another and decoupled demographically. This subdivision has created a metapopulation structure in each species, characterized by species-specific rates of local colonization and extinction. Inverse clines in flowering time occur in the grass Anthoxanthum odoratum across some plot boundaries. These suggest that reproductive isolation between plots has been reinforced by natural selection. Drift as well as selection may have taken place in A. odoratum, especially on plots where effective population size is restricted by population bottlenecks caused by drought. Park Grass illustrates how long-term experiments grow in value with time and how they may be used to investigate scientific questions that were inconceivable at their inception. This is as likely to be true of the future of Park Grass as it has proved to be of its past. ...|$|R

This dissertation contains three main studies of the KLJN system. The first study presents the refutation of a physical model, proposed by Gunn, Allison and Abbott (GAA), to utilize electromagnetic waves for eavesdropping on the KLJN secure key distribution. The correct mathematical model of the GAA scheme is deduced, {{which is based on}} impedances at the quasi-static limit. Mathematical analysis and simulation results confirm our approach and prove that GAA?s experimental interpretation is incorrect too. The second study analyzes one of the passive (listening) attacks against the KLJN system, the cable capacitance attack. In practical situations, due to the non-idealities of the building elements, there is a small information leak, which can be mitigated by privacy amplification or other techniques so that unconditional (information-theoretic) security is preserved. The industrial cable and circuit simulator LTSPICE is used to validate the information leak due to one of the non-idealities in KLJN, the parasitic (cable) capacitance. Simulation results show that privacy amplification and/or capacitor killer (capacitance compensation) arrangements can effectively eliminate the leak.

Unfortunately, many existing flow visualization systems were developed for time-independent (steady) solutions and do not adequately depict solutions from unsteady flow simulations. Furthermore, most systems only handle one time step of the solutions individually and do not consider the time-dependent nature of the solutions. For example, instantaneous streamlines are computed by tracking the particles using one time step of the solution. However, for streaklines and timelines, particles need to be tracked through all time steps. Streaklines can reveal quite different information about the flow than those revealed by <b>instantaneous</b> streamlines. <b>Comparisons</b> of <b>instantaneous</b> streamlines with dynamic streaklines are shown.

40|$|Cooperativity {{among the}} four {{subunits}} helps give rise to the remarkable voltage sensitivity of Shaker potassium channels, whose open probability changes tenfold for a 5 -mV change in membrane potential. The cooperativity in these channels is thought to arise from a concerted structural transition as the final step in opening the channel. Recordings of single-channel ionic currents from certain other channel types, {{as well as our}} previous recordings from T 442 S mutant Shaker channels, however, display intermediate conductance levels in addition to the fully open and closed states. These sublevels might represent stepwise, rather than concerted, transitions in the final steps of channel activation. Here, we report a similar fine structure in the closing transitions of Shaker channels lacking the mutation. Describing the deactivation time course with hidden Markov models, we find that two subconductance levels are rapidly traversed during most closing transitions of chimeric, high conductance Shaker channels. The lifetimes of these levels are voltage-dependent, with maximal values of 52 and 22 μs at − 100 mV, and the voltage dependences of transitions among these states suggest that they arise from equivalent conformational changes occurring in individual subunits. At least one subconductance level is found to be traversed in normal conductance Shaker channels. We speculate that voltage-dependent conformational changes in the subunits give rise to changes in a “pore gate” associated with the selectivity filter region of the channel, producing the subconductance states. As a control for the hidden Markov analysis, we applied the same procedures to recordings of the recovery from N-type inactivation in Shaker channels.

The subject of globalization has been widely discussed {{in the new millennium}} by the scholars, administrators, activists and others all over the world from media research and communication policy points of view. A substantial amount of research has been carried out on the impact of globalization on media system, management and operations in abroad. Scholars have conducted an extensive and intensive review of major studies about media and globalization. There are several schools of thought in the field of media. The scholars examined television programs, news networks, children's culture and pop music and noted that the adoption of local cultural texts into mainstream U.

Scholars have coined a new theory of media globalization which pointed out that feedback in the converged world of digital communication is <b>instantaneous</b> in <b>comparison</b> with traditional analog mass communication. Globalization is commonly used as a shorthand way of describing the spread and connectedness of production, communication and technologies across the world.

Scholars have noted that global media adversely affect local culture, value system and public interest because of increasing media monopoly and imperialism. The phenomenon of media globalization along with the increasing abundance of media-text production has produced various effects which are being researched by communication scholars. The media organizations are required {{to strike a balance between}} profit motive and service motive in order to achieve the goal of corporate social responsibility in the age of globalization of media...|$|R
40|$|A scalar plume is {{the spatial}} and {{temporal}} structure of a released scalar, such as heat, chemical or contaminant. The resulting downstream structure is governed by the 3 D Advection-Diffusion equation, which couples both advection, through the Navier Stokes equations, and diffusion describing the relative relationship {{and structure of the}} plume. Solutions to these equations for turbulent flows are computationally expensive and therefore most of the understanding surrounding turbulent plume structure stems from experimental results. Currently, a majority of experiments investigating plume structure have been done in aqueous environments using planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF), while in gaseous environments experiments utilize single point ion detection techniques. This thesis adapted a current gaseous PLIF technique to study airborne 2 D scalar plume structure to be suitable for capturing neutrally buoyant plume-like data under two boundary conditions: (1) free-stream release, and (2) near bed release. Processing of the two collected datasets included investigations into instantaneous behavior and computation of relevant statistical metrics including mean concentration, RMS of concentration fluctuations, and intermittency. Results in the free-stream and near bed data differ greatly in the <b>instantaneous</b> and statistical <b>comparisons,</b> suggesting a significant difference in airborne plume behavior once a boundary is introduced...|$|R
40|$|The {{temperature}} measured by non-linear excitation regime two-line atomic fluorescence, NTLAF, is compared with previous {{data in a}} well characterised turbulent non-premixed flame, known as the TNF DLR-A flame. The comparison of the previous detailed single-point measurements with the NTLAF measurements is {{used to assess the}} accuracy, and limitations, of the NTLAF technique. The NTLAF measurements were obtained using two different seeding methods, both separately and together, namely by seeding the indium as a solution of indium chloride conveyed as a fine mist with the fuel and by directly seeding neutral indium atoms into the fuel stream by laser ablation of an indium rod. Both instantaneous images and radial profiles of the mean and RMS data are reported for the different techniques. The calculated inter-pixel uncertainty of the measurements is estimated to be ∼ 50 K in the mean, and 8 % uncertainty on an <b>instantaneous</b> basis. The <b>comparison</b> is performed on a conditional basis, given that the NTLAF measurements are limited to a lower temperature threshold and to the stoichiometric and rich regions of the flame. On this basis, the NTLAF method is found to generally agree with the TNF DLR-A data to within approximately 100 K. Paul R. Medwell, Qing N. Chan, Bassam B. Dally, Saleh Mahmoud, Zeyad T.

40|$|AbstractA {{computationally}} economic finite-element-based {{approach has}} been developed to predict the stress–strain and fracture behaviour of an 8 -Harness satin woven ceramic matrix composite with strain-induced damage. The finite element analysis utilises a solid element to model the behaviour of the homogenised orthotropic uni-directional tow and its matrix. The underpinning models of the tow and matrix, (Tang et al., 2009) capture the physics of the interactions between fibres and matrix; and, in this way, permit modelling that bridges the length scales of the fibres and full-scale components. The non-linear multi-axial stress–strain behaviour of the composite has been discretised by multi-linear elastic curves; and the latter {{has been used as}} input to a user defined subroutine, UMAT, in the commercial finite element package, ABAQUS. A partial unit cell model has been constructed of the 8 -Harness satin weave composite of carbon fibres embedded in an amorphous carbon matrix, HITCO C/C. Predictions of the global stress–strain curve, which include the effects of fibre waviness, have been made for two failure modes: the first by deformation localisation, and the second by dynamic tow failure on fibre fracture, triggered by <b>instantaneous</b> pull-out deactivation. <b>Comparisons</b> have been made between the predictions and experimental data that exhibit two classes of fracture behaviour: brittle and quasi-ductile. The predicted results, both with and without tow waviness, compare well with the experimental data; however, the predictions for waviness are slightly better. The two extremes of experimental behaviour have been found to correspond with the two tow fracture criteria modelled...|$|R
40|$|Phased-Array Doppler Sonars (PADS) {{have been}} used to probe an area several hundred meters on a side with 8 m spatial resolution, {{sampling}} every second or less with under 2 cm/s rms velocity error per sample. Estimates from two systems were combined to produce horizontal velocity vectors. Here concerns specific to use in shallow water are addressed. In particular, the shallower the water is, the larger the fraction of bottom backscatter, so the stronger the bias is toward zero Doppler shift in the estimates. First, direct comparisons are made with other current measurements made during the ONR-sponsored multi-investigator field experiment “SandyDuck, ” which took place in fall 1997 off the coast of Duck, NC. While the coherences between PADS and in situ current measurements are high, the amplitude of the sonar response is generally low. To explore this further, a simplified model of wave shoaling is developed, permitting estimates of wave-frequency velocity variances from point measurements to be extrapolated over the whole field of view of the PADS for comparison. The resulting time-space movies of sonar response are consistent with quasi-steady acoustic backscatter intensity from the bottom competing with a variable backscatter level from the water volume. The latter may arise (for example) from intermittent injection of bubbles by breaking waves, producing patches of high or low acoustic response that advect with the mean flow. Once this competition is calibrated via the surface wave variance <b>comparison,</b> <b>instantaneous</b> measured total backscatter intensities can be compared to an estimated bottom backscatter level (which is updated on a longer time-scale, appropriate to evolution of the water depth or bottom roughness) to provide corrected sonar estimates over the region. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDuring the FETCH {{experiment}} in NW Mediterranean Sea (March and April 1998), surface fluxes were measured {{on board a}} research vessel and on a moored buoy. To provide the ocean surface forcing at the mesoscale, output fields of three meteorological models (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and Meteo-France ARPEGE and ALADIN) were gathered as well as satellite data. To evaluate the consistency of model fields, we compare ship measurements to the predicted radiative and turbulent surface fluxes and to turbulent fluxes derived from analyses using a bulk formula. We first analyze {{the quality of the}} ship bulk fluxes in terms of possible effects of the flow distortion and of intrinsic variability as function of the integration time. The airflow distortion over the ship is found to significantly affect fluxes, but the mean fluxes over the experiment remain unchanged because of compensation between positive and negative errors due to the varying apparent wind direction. Spectral analysis of the ship time series as well as comparison of fluxes obtained by using several averaging times from 1 to 90 min show that the optimal scale for computing ship fluxes is about 20 min, ensuring consistency with the derivation of bulk drag and exchange coefficient. These fluxes are then taken as reference for the comparison with models and satellites. None of the predicted radiative fluxes is consistent with ship measurements. Model turbulent fluxes differ from each other, and the main reason is the discrepancy between modeled and observed atmospheric features. Large discrepancies are found between predicted fluxes and ship fluxes in strong wind conditions due to the different flux parameterization for heat fluxes. Model bulk fluxes thus compare better to ship than predicted fluxes, particularly during the middle period of the experiment depending on the model. On the contrary, the Meteosat-derived downward radiative fluxes are comparable to the ship data, and their high time sampling allows us to describe the diurnal cycle of the solar heating. They can be used either at an <b>instantaneous</b> scale (<b>comparison</b> of the satellite flux averaged over 0. 1 ° Â 0. 1 ° with 10 min averaged ship fluxes) or at a larger scale (0. 3 ° Â 0. 3 °, 1 hour). It is shown that the surface latent heat flux, derived from a combination of Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSMI) brightness temperatures and sea surface temperature (SST), as obtained from IR sensors (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), is of a quality similar or better to model bulk fluxes.

40|$|The systems studied involve {{deposition}} of metals {{of a larger}} atomic diameter on a Cu 100 single crystal surface under vacuum and determining the structures formed along with {{the effect on the}} Cu 100 substrate. Cu microelectrodes were fabricated and characterised with Indium electrodeposited on the electrode surface. The In on Cu 100 growth mode is compared with the growth mode of electrodeposited Indium on Cu microelectrodes. The Cu 100 /In system has been studied for the In coverage range 0. 1 - 0. 65 monolayer using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). The Auger signal versus deposition time plot for the {{deposition of}} In on Cu 100 is characteristic of the Stranski-Krastanov growth mode. In this deposition mechanism the first atomic layer grows in a layer by layer fashion but when monolayer point is reached, subsequent growth occurs in the form of 3 D crystallites. At a concentration of 0. 4 ± 0. 05 monolayer In forms a (9 V 2 x 2 a / 2) R 4 5 ° on the Cu 100 surface which on heating above a temperature of 373 K undergoes a reproducible phase transition to form a c(2 x 2) phase. Increasing the In deposited to a surface concentration of 0. 6 ± 0. 05 monolayer results in a Cu 100 -c(4 x 4) -ln overlayer structure which remains uniform with heating. A Tensor LEED analysis was conducted on this structure in conjunction with K. Pussi et al., from which {{it was found that the}} In overlayer consisted of two layers. The In layer closest to bulk comprises a c(2 x 2) structure with In atoms occupying 4 fold hollow sites with respect to substrate. The top layer is a c(4 x 4) In layer in which the atoms lie at four fold hollow sites with respect to the c(2 x 2) layer. The deposition of 0. 25 ML Sb on clean Cu 100 at room temperature results in a p(2 x 2) LEED pattern which is confirmed by STM. Using Tensor LEED calculations, the structure of the Cu 100 -p(2 x 2) -Sb phase has been determined. The results show that despite the large size mismatch between Sb (atomic radius = 1. 450 A) and Cu (atomic radius = 1. 278 A), a surface alloy is formed in which Sb atoms substitute Cu atoms in the outermost layer. Sb is found to ripple outward from the surface by 0. 56 + 0. 05 A. The second and deeper Cu layers are found to be close to their bulk values. As the Sb coverage is increased to a concentration of 0. 33 ML, the surface exhibits a p(6 x 6) LEED pattern. The atomic resolution STM images for this surface display alternating double and single rows of atoms implying a reconstruction in the selvedge. Based on the STM and LEED results possible models for the Cu 100 - p(6 x 6) -Sb structure have been proposed. The favoured structures are based on a slight deformation from the simple c(2 x 2) surface. Cu microelectrodes were fabricated and characterized using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The Cu microelectrodes were found to have a potential window of — 0. 08 to - 0. 6 V in HCIO 4, although this can be improved with pH adjustment, with the potential window found to be at a maximum of + 0. 1 to - 1. 0 V at a pH of 4. Chronoamperometric data was taken in differing concentrations of HCIO 4 giving resistance, capacitance and RC time constant values for the Cu microelectrode in an HCIO 4 electrolyte system. Indium was electrochemically deposited on the Cu microelectrode at a potential of— 0. 6 V. Cyclic voltammograms are taken at different scan rates to determine the dynamics of In deposition. At low scan rates there was an increase in the amount of. In deposited as witnessed by hysteresis on the cyclic voltammograms. This hysteresis is thought to be caused by In on In deposition. Al scan rates of 1. 0 Vs"! and above it is thought that little or no In deposition occurs as peaks corresponding to indium reduction or subsequent oxidation are no longer observed. SEM and EDX were used to confirm the deposition of In on the Cu microelectrodes. Chronoamperometric measurements were taken to determine the growth mode and nucleation type of the deposited In. From these measurements, a plot of I/Imax versus t for the. In deposition is compared with nucleation and growth models for 2 D progressive, 2 D instantaneous, 3 D progressive and 3 D <b>instantaneous.</b> After <b>comparison</b> it was found that the electrodeposition of In on Cu microelectrodes obeys a progressive nucleation mode with further In growth found to be 3 D. This result compares favourably with the growth mode for In deposition on a Cu 100 substrate under vacuum, with the growth mode for both being 3 D. It was found that the nucleation types for both were remarkably similar with vacuum deposited In and electrodeposited indium both undergoing progressive nucleation...|$|R
