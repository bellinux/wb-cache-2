5000|$|In the game, {{the player}} can select between seven [...] "operatives", {{which are the}} {{characters}} controlled throughout the playthrough. The skills varies depending on the character chosen to play. If the character dies, another operative can be selected with {{a different set of}} skills. When all characters had died, the game finishes. The player is also able to rescue operatives lost in the <b>field,</b> <b>unlocking</b> them for future playthroughs of the game or, alternatively, rescue a fallen agent who's just been killed.|$|R
50|$|Environments {{are fully}} {{interactive}} to allow players to destroy it, pick up {{items on the}} <b>field</b> and <b>unlock</b> new pathways. Cutting away the field in such a fashion {{can be used to}} the player's advantage during battles with monsters.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{his arrival}} at the control level, Ratchet discovers that Vox has wired the station to explode, and if Ratchet cannot {{deactivate}} the explosives, everyone there will die. Running a massive gauntlet of enemies and destroying the station's power generators, Ratchet deactivates the containment <b>fields</b> and <b>unlocks</b> the station's escape shuttles. After being defeated by Ratchet, Vox manually activates the station's self-destruct sequence, planning to kill both himself and Ratchet.|$|R

We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} magnetic <b>field</b> on the <b>unlocking</b> stress for dislocations in Cz-Si, measured at 600 o C, depending on the thermal prehistory of samples. The effect increases with increasing of the duration of sample annealing at 600 o C before the magnetic field treatment. The experimental data {{are consistent with the}} assumption that the magnetic field stimulate some changes in configuration of oxygen accumulated at dislocations before the magnetic field treatment, but not the state of oxygen in a bulk...|$|R
40|$|The {{equations}} {{describing the}} spin dynamics of He- 3 -A have been generalised {{to allow for}} the effect of susceptibility anisotropy on the Leggett-Takagi damping. Analytical and numerical solutions have been obtained for the configuration where 1 is locked parallel to a static magnetic field by boundaries. Our investigations show that the dipole unlocking transition, where d flips from parallel to perpendicular to 1, should proceed via a long lived spin precession at a frequency (omega(L) + omega(LD)), where omega(L) is the Larmor frequency and omega(LD) the Larmor frequency at the dipole <b>unlocking</b> <b>field.</b> Progress in searching for this mode experimentally is reported...|$|R
40|$|Metagenomics {{deals with}} the {{isolation}} of genetic material directly recovered from environmental samples. Metagenomics as an approach has emerged {{over the past two}} decades to elucidate a host of microbial communities inhabiting a specific niche with the goal of understanding their genetic diversity, population structure, and ecological role played by them. A number of new and novel molecules with significant functionalities and applications have been identified through this approach. In fact, many investigators are engaged in this <b>field</b> to <b>unlock</b> the untapped genetic resources with funding from governments sector. The sustainable economic future of modern industrialized societies requires the development of novel molecules, enzymes, processes, products, and applications. Metagenomics can also be applied to solve practical challenges in the field of medicine, agriculture, sustainability, and ecology. Metagenomics promises to provide new molecules and novel enzymes with diverse functions and enhanced features compared to the enzymes from the culturable microorganisms. Besides the application of metagenomics for unlocking novel biocatalysts from nature, it also has found applications in fields as diverse as bioremediation, personalized medicine, xenobiotic metabolism, and so forth...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} transverse continuous wave NMR in a geometry where the modes {{are influenced by}} susceptibility anisotropy. The helium sample is separated by mylar foils into layers 12 mu m thick perpendicular to the external dc magnetic field. In this geometry l is constrained to be parallel to the field and d switches from parallel to perpendicular to the field over a small range of field around the dipole <b>unlocking</b> <b>field.</b> The mode frequencies below this critical field yield a value for the susceptibility anisotropy. Above the critical field the expected negative frequency shift is observed, {{as well as a}} positive frequency shift due to bulk material and an unexpected signal close to the Larmor frequency...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Nanoantennas for {{visible and}} {{infrared}} radiation can strongly enhance {{the interaction of}} light with nanoscale matter by their ability to efficiently link propagating and spatially localized optical <b>fields.</b> This ability <b>unlocks</b> an enormous potential for applications ranging from nanoscale optical microscopy and spectroscopy over solar energy conversion, integrated optical nanocircuitry, opto-electronics and density-of-states engineering to ultra-sensing as well as enhancement of optical nonlinearities. Here we review the current understanding of metallic optical antennas based on the background of both well-developed radiowave antenna engineering and plasmonics. In particular, we discuss the role of plasmonic resonances {{on the performance of}} nanoantennas and address the influence of geometrical parameters imposed by nanofabrication. Finally, we give a brief account of the current status of the field and the major established and emerging lines of investigation in this vivid area of research. Contents...|$|R

5000|$|Despite {{his initial}} strong {{performances}} on the pitch, in March 2015, Marios Oikonomou {{went through a}} difficult spell {{in which he was}} forced to stay in the bench after the arrival of Daniele Gastaldello. The transition to the three-man defence allowed him to return to the <b>field</b> and to <b>unlock</b> the game against A.S. Livorno Calcio by scoring a goal giving three key points in the race for promotion. He insisted on the method of training and the managerial abilities of Luis Diego López. Oikonomou is necessary to turn into a game the good things done in training: [...] "We must think only of what we feel in the week and put it into practice in the match. There is nothing to change in our daily work even though we do few goals." [...] But even with the arrival of Gastaldello, Oikonomou has seen it as a stimulus: [...] "I tried to {{look on the bright side}} - admitted the defender - from players like him and Domenico Maietta I can learn a lot, they both have a valuable experience. With them I feel good, and now with the three-man defence we can do good things [...] ".|$|R
40|$|This study investigates dual element isotope {{fractionation}} during aerobic biodegradation of 1, 2 -dichloroethane (1, 2 -DCA) via oxidative cleavage of a C−H bond (Pseudomonas sp. strain DCA 1) versus C−Cl bond cleavage by S N 2 reaction (Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ 10 and Ancylobacter aquaticus AD 20). Compound-specific chlorine isotope analysis of 1, 2 -DCA was performed {{for the first}} time, and {{isotope fractionation}} (&# 949; Cl bulk) was determined by measurements of the same samples in three different laboratories using two gas chromatography−isotope ratio mass spectrometry systems and one gas chromatography−quadrupole mass spectrometry system. Strongly pathway-dependent slopes (&# 916;&# 948; 13 C/&# 916; &# 948; 37 Cl), 0. 78 &# 177; 0. 03 (oxidation) and 7. 7 &# 177; 0. 2 (S N 2), delineate {{the potential of the}} dual isotope approach to identify 1, 2 -DCA degradation pathways in the field. In contrast to different &# 949; C bulk values [− 3. 5 &# 177; 0. 1 ‰ (oxidation) and − 31. 9 &# 177; 0. 7 and − 32. 0 &# 177; 0. 9 ‰ (S N 2) ], the obtained &# 949; Cl bulk values were surprisingly similar for the two pathways: − 3. 8 &# 177; 0. 2 ‰ (oxidation) and − 4. 2 &# 177; 0. 1 and − 4. 4 &# 177; 0. 2 ‰ (S N 2). Apparent kinetic isotope effects (AKIEs) of 1. 0070 &# 177; 0. 0002 (13 C-AKIE, oxidation), 1. 068 &# 177; 0. 001 (13 C-AKIE, S N 2), and 1. 0087 &# 177; 0. 0002 (37 Cl-AKIE, S N 2) fell within expected ranges. In contrast, an unexpectedly large secondary 37 Cl-AKIE of 1. 0038 &# 177; 0. 0002 reveals a hitherto unrecognized involvement of C−Cl bonds in microbial C−H bond oxidation. Our two-dimensional isotope fractionation patterns allow for the first time reliable 1, 2 -DCA degradation pathway identification in the <b>field,</b> which <b>unlocks</b> the full potential of isotope applications for this important groundwater contaminant...|$|R
40|$|The lack {{of clarity}} and shared {{understanding}} regarding the scientific foundations of Health Policy and Systems Research (HPSR) [1] potentially has very negative consequences for the field [2]. Disagreement over the value {{of different types of}} theoretical frameworks and research methods can lead to inappropriate evaluations of research proposals, contradictory reviews of the same paper, and delays in publication. Excessive time may be spent communicating broad frameworks to other researchers within HPSR, inhibiting progression to more detailed and specific conversations. Communication barriers may discourage inter-disciplinary collaboration, driving researchers back to their disciplinary safety zones, and creating potential for conflict that may discourage younger researchers who may be less secure in their career from staying in the field. As the second paper in this series concluded [1], there is an urgent need to build understanding across disciplinary boundaries. This final paper in the "Building the Field of HPSR" series turns to practical questions concerning how to remove structural barriers that currently inhibit the development of the HPSR <b>field</b> and thus <b>unlock</b> HPSR capacities. HPSR suffers from many of the same problems as other branches of health research in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) : major imbalances between the resources available in high- versus low- and middle-income contexts [3], acute shortages of skilled researchers (especially senior ones), and relatively few organizations that house HPSR expertise [4]. Historically, low levels of funding for HPSR compared to clinical or biomedical research have compounded these problems. Many papers provide relevant recommendations to address health research capacity issues in LMICs [5]–[8]. However, there is also a nexus of issues specific to HPSR that currently constrains development of the field. This paper builds on the analysis of the previous papers in this series [1],[9] to investigate the practical problems faced and then develops an agenda for building the HPSR field...|$|R
