5000|$|The use of <b>flumequine</b> in food {{animals had}} sparked {{considerable}} debate. Significant and harmful residues of quinolones {{have been found}} in animals treated with quinolones and later slaughtered and sold as food products. There has been significant concern regarding the amount of <b>flumequine</b> residue found within food animals such as fish, poultry and cattle. [...] In 2003 the Joint FAO/WHO Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) withdrew the maximum residue limits (MRLs) for <b>flumequine</b> and carbadox based on evidence showing both are direct acting genotoxic carcinogens, therefore the Committee was unable to establish an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for human exposure to such residues. Subsequently, in 2006, the JEFCA, re-established the ADI having received appropriate evidence and MRLs were re-specified. The role of JECFA is to evaluate toxicology, residue chemistry and related information and make recommendations for acceptable daily intake (ADI) levels and maximum residue limits (MRLs). At its 16th session, held May 2006, the Committee on Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Foods (CCRVDF) requested information on registered uses of <b>flumequine.</b> As the CCRVDF did not receive any information regarding the registered uses of <b>flumequine</b> that they had requested, the committee members agreed to discontinue work on the MRLs for <b>flumequine</b> in shrimp.|$|E

The aims of this study were to examine and compare the pharmacokinetic properties of the quinolones oxolinic acid, <b>flumequine,</b> sarafloxacin, and enrofloxacin after intravascular and oral administration to Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) by using identical experimental designs. The study was performed in seawater at 10. 2 +/- 0. 2 degree C with Atlantic salmon weighing 240 +/- 50 g (mean +/- standard deviation). The bioavailability varied considerably among the four quinolones. Following oral administration of medicated feed, the bioavailabilities of oxolinic acid, <b>flumequine,</b> sarafloxacin, and enrofloxacin were 30. 1, 44. 7, 2. 2, and 55. 5 %, respectively. Taking the different dosages (25 mg/kg of body weight for oxolinic acid and <b>flumequine</b> and 10 mg/kg for sarafloxacin and enrofloxacin) into account, enrofloxacin showed the highest maximum concentration in plasma, followed by <b>flumequine,</b> oxolinic acid, and sarafloxacin.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{transfer}} of R plasmids between bacteria {{has been well}} studied under laboratory conditions and the transfer frequency {{has been found to}} vary between plasmids and under various physical conditions. For the first time, we here study the expression of the selected plasmid mobility genes traD, virB 11 and virD 4 in the 45 kb IncU plasmid, pRAS 1, conferring resistance to tetracycline, trimethoprim and sulphonamide, using an in vivo zebrafish infection- treatment model. Results Three days after oral infection of adult zebrafish with Aeromonas hydrophila harboring pRAS 1, elevated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF α, IL- 1 β and IL- 8) and complement C 3 genes in the intestine coincided with disease symptoms. Tetracycline, trimethoprim and an ineffective concentration of <b>flumequine</b> given 48 h prior to sampling, strongly increased expression of plasmid mobility genes, whereas an effective dosage of <b>flumequine</b> resulted in lower levels of mRNA copies of these genes relative to placebo treatment. Following effective treatment with <b>flumequine,</b> and ineffective treatments with a low concentration of <b>flumequine,</b> with trimethoprim or with sulphonamide, the intestinal expression of immune genes was strongly induced compared to placebo treated control fish. Conclusions Treatment of zebrafish infected with an antibiotic resistant (Tc R, Tm R, Su R) A. hydrophila with ineffective concentrations of <b>flumequine</b> or the ineffective antimicrobials tetracycline and trimethoprim strongly induced expression of genes mediating conjugative {{transfer of}} the R-plasmid pRAS 1. Simultaneously, there was a strong induction of selected inflammatory and immune response genes, which was again evident in fish subjected to ineffective treatment protocols. Our findings point to the essential role of therapeutic practices in escalation or control of antibiotic resistance transfer, and suggest that antibiotic substances, even in sub-inhibitory concentrations, may stimulate innate defenses against bacterial infections. </p...|$|E

Fingerlings were arranged in 30 subjects groups maintained in 15 °C flow-through tanks, and experimentally infected by IM injection of about 1 or 10 LD 50. A preliminary administration of 200 g/ 100 kg of fish of Flumix was done on a sample during a fortnight and {{did not result in}} any observation of acute toxicity. A conspicuous protective effect of the drug was noticed in all cases the treatment was carried on at the same day as the infection. Differences between mortality percentages in controls and treated fish were about 60 p. 100, whatever the trout species ant the bacterial strain. Variations were of trifling importance according to the therapeutic doses, and when testing fish with high doses of pathogen ([MATH] 10 LD 50) the effect seemed better, resulting of the higher mortality of controls. In some cases, the treatment was started 20 hours after inoculation of Aeromonas. Except in one case, the protection was then very lowered, and this has been ascribed to the loss of appetite of diseased subjects In conclusion, the efficacy of <b>fluméquine</b> treatments in control of furunculosis is stated and some practical indications are given. The dose of 40 g/ 100 kg of fish of <b>fluméquine</b> powder (40 g/kg of food when feeding at 1 %) is recommended for fish, diet being distributed in 2 meals, and the rules of every other antimicrobial treatments being respected...|$|E
40|$|Phytotoxicity of <b>Flumequine</b> on {{the aquatic}} weed Lythrum salicaria L. was {{determined}} by two laboratory models: a single concentration test, by which the effects of 100 mg l(- 1) were evaluated after 10, 20, 30 days and a multiple concentration test, by which the effects of 5000 - 1000 - 500 - 100 - 50 mu g l(- 1) were evaluated after 35 -day exposure. 100 mg l(- 1) are highly toxic and significantly decrease the growth of plants; this effect increases with time. Concentrations between 5000 and 50 mu g l(- 1) induced hormesis in plants, by significantly increasing mean number and dimension of leaves and secondary roots. The effect is the highest at 50 mu g l(- 1) and decreases with increase in concentration. Both toxic effect and hormesis {{can be related to}} plant drug uptake, quite high, in the order of mu g g(- 1). The ecological implication of <b>Flumequine</b> contamination in aquatic environments and the possible use of Lythrum salicaria for bioremediation and/ or monitoring technique are discussed.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine antimicrobial resistance rate of Escherichia coli isolates from chickens against commonly used antimicrobials in veterinary medicine. A total of 200 faecal samples of chickens were analyzed for pathogenic E. coli. Isolates were subjected to antimicrobial resistance testing by the disc diffusion method. The microbial resistance of tylosin, oxytetracycline, linco-spectin, neomycin, sulfadiazine/trimethoprim, enrofloxacin, difloxacin, <b>flumequine</b> and forphenical were determined. Out of 200 bacterial isolates 96 % were identified as E. coli. A high prevalence of resistance were observed in E. coli for commonly used antibiotics in poultry medicine, tylosin (100 %), oxytetracycline (94. 8 %), sulfadiazine/trimethprim (80. 7 %), <b>flumequine</b> (79. 7 %), neomycin (79. 2 %), difloxacin (78. 7 %), enrofloxacin (65. 5 %). The least resistance rate of E. coli isolates were observed for florphenicol (4. 2 %) and linco-spectin (4. 2 %). Findings from this study indicates high resistance rate of E. coli to commonly used antibiotics, therefore, the use of antimicrobial agents should be restricted to treating infections and call for banning of antimicrobials as growth promoters in poultry industry...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Italy {{is one of}} {{the major}} fish {{producing}} countries in the Mediterranean area. It produces 39, 700 tonnes/year of trout, 19, 700 tonnes/year of sea bass and sea bream, 1700 tonnes/year of eels and almost 5000 tonnes/year of other salt water and fresh water species. Several pathologies affect such species, therefore it is often necessary to undertake antibiotic treatments (tetracycline, <b>flumequine,</b> sulphonamides, amoxicillin) or to arrange vaccination programmes against the principal bacterial pathologies (vibriosis...|$|E
