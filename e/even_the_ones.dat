25|$|The {{consequences}} {{of reducing the}} costs of production of the 8th edition can be seen today in surviving sets. With only 402 plates, this edition has the fewest since the second edition, and far fewer woodcuts within the text pages were used than in the 7th edition. The maps are all reprinted from the 7th edition, <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> {{that should have been}} updated. In the first few volumes, a sheet of onion-skin paper faces each plate, but after volume 6, they were eliminated. To save money, the end pages and covers were not marbled, as this was an expensive process. Finally, the end pages contain advertisements for other products sold by A & C. Black, such as atlases and travel guides, and advertisements encouraging subscribers to continue their enrollments.|$|E
500|$|In March 2016, Marvel {{announced}} that Ms. Marvel would tie into the [...] "Civil War II" [...] storyline by releasing a promotional image illustrating a rift between Khan and Danvers. [...] "While [...] "Civil War II" [...] may have initiated this rift, we've {{known for some}} time that Kamala would eventually need to separate herself from her idols. Her journey centers around self-discovery and identity, and a part of that exploration includes separating yourself from those you put on pedestals. The rift between Carol and Kamala doesn't really have to do with right and wrong. It has to do with growing up and realizing that you perceive the world differently from <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> you love," [...] Amanat elaborated.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers responded {{positively}} to [...] "Tapestry". Zack Handlen, while writing for The A.V.

[...] He gave the episode a rating of [...] "A". In DeCandido's review of [...] "Tapestry" [...] for Tor.com, he compared the episode to It's a Wonderful Life, and called it one of the [...] "finest hours" [...] of the series. He praised [...] "Tapestry" [...] for endorsing the Q/Picard chemistry at the heart of Q episodes, and said that Stewart and de Lancie [...] "play off each other magnificently".

500|$|On 11 October 1914, Marie and Ferdinand were {{acclaimed}} as {{king and}} queen in the Chamber of Deputies. Princess Anne Marie Callimachi, {{a close friend of}} Marie's, wrote that [...] "as Crown Princess, [...] had been popular; as queen, she was more loved". Marie maintained a certain influence on her husband and the entire court, leading historian A. L. Easterman to write that [...] "it was not , but Marie who ruled in Romania". At the time of Ferdinand's ascension, the government was led by the liberal prime minister Ion I. C. Brătianu. Ferdinand and Marie jointly decided to not make many changes in court and let people accept the transition from one regime to another, rather than force them. Thus, many of Carol and Elisabeth's servants were kept in place, <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> who were not particularly liked. With Brătianu's help, Marie began pressuring Ferdinand into entering the war; concurrently, she contacted various reigning relatives in Europe and bargained for the best terms for Romania, in case the country would enter the war. Marie favoured an alliance with the Triple Entente (Russia, France and Britain), partly because of her British ancestry. Neutrality was not without perils, and entering the war with the Entente meant that Romania would act as Russia's [...] "buffer" [...] against possible attacks.|$|E

2500|$|The {{series has}} been noted for its {{relatively}} sympathetic portrayal of the aristocratic family, and the class-based society of early 20thcentury Britain. This has led to criticism from the political left and praise from the right. James Fenton wrote in The New York Review of Books [...] "it is noticeable that the aristocrats in the series, <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> {{who are supposed to}} be the most ridiculous, never lapse into the most offensive kind of upper-class drawl one would expect of them. Great care has been taken to keep them pleasant and approachable, even when the things they say are sometimes shown to be class-bound and unfeeling." [...] Jerry Bowyer argued in Forbes that the sympathy for aristocracy is over-stated, and that the show is simply more balanced than most period dramas, which he believes have had a tendency to demonise or ridicule upper class characters. He wrote that Downton Abbey shows [...] "there is no inherent need for good TV to be left of center. Stories sympathetic to virtue, preservation of property and admiration of nobility and of wealth can be told beautifully and to wide audiences." ...|$|E

60|$|Considering the {{situation}} and circumstances, the record for next day, May 29, is one which has a surprise in it for those dull {{people who think that}} nothing but medicines and doctors can cure the sick. A little starvation can really do more for the average sick man than can the best medicines and the best doctors. I do not mean a restricted diet; I mean total abstention from food for one or two days. I speak from experience; starvation has been my cold and fever doctor for fifteen years, and has accomplished a cure in all instances. The third mate told me in Honolulu that the 'Portyghee' had lain in his hammock for months, raising his family of abscesses and feeding like a cannibal. We have seen that in spite of dreadful weather, deprivation of sleep, scorching, drenching, and all manner of miseries, thirteen days of starvation 'wonderfully recovered' him. There were four sailors down sick when the ship was burned. Twenty-five days of pitiless starvation have followed, and now we have this curious record: 'All the men are hearty and strong; <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> that were down sick are well, except poor Peter.' When I wrote an article some months ago urging temporary abstention from food as a remedy for an inactive appetite and for disease, I was accused of jesting, but I was in earnest. 'We are all wonderfully well and strong, comparatively speaking.' On this day the starvation regime drew its belt a couple of buckle-holes tighter: the bread ration was reduced from the usual piece of cracker the size of a silver dollar to the half of that, and one meal was abolished from the daily three. This will weaken the men physically, but if there are any diseases of an ordinary sort left in them they will disappear.|$|E
