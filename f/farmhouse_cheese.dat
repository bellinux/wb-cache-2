40|$|Abstract For {{studying}} the microbiota of four Danish surface-ripened cheeses produced at three farmhouses and one industrial dairy, both a culture-dependent and culture-independent approach were used. After dereplication {{of the initial}} set of 433 isolates by (GTG) 5 -PCR fingerprinting, 217 bacterial and 25 yeast isolates were identified by se-quencing of the 16 S rRNA gene or the D 1 /D 2 domain of the 26 S rRNA gene, respectively. At the end of ripening, the cheese core microbiota of the <b>farmhouse</b> <b>cheeses</b> consisted of the mesophilic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) starter cultures Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Leuconostoc mesen-teorides as well as non-starter LAB including different Lactobacillus spp. The cheese from the industrial dairy was almost exclusively dominated by Lb. paracasei. The surface bacterial microbiota of all four cheeses were domi-nated by Corynebacterium spp. and/or Brachybacterium spp. Brevibacterium spp. {{was found to be}} subdominant compared to other bacteria on the <b>farmhouse</b> <b>cheeses,</b> and no Brevibacterium spp. was found on the cheese from the industrial dairy, even though B. linens was used as surface-ripening culture. Moreover, Gram-negative bacteria identi-fied as Alcalignes faecalis and Proteus vulgaris were found on one of the <b>farmhouse</b> <b>cheeses.</b> The surface yeast micro-biota consisted primarily of one dominating species for each <b>cheese.</b> For the <b>farmhouse</b> <b>cheeses,</b> the dominant yeast species were Yarrowia lipolytica, Geotrichum spp. and Debaryomyces hansenii, respectively, and for the cheese from the industrial dairy, D. hansenii was the dominant yeast species. Additionally, denaturing gradient gel electro-phoresis (DGGE) analysis revealed that Streptococcus thermophilus was present in the <b>farmhouse</b> raw milk <b>cheese</b> analysed in this study. Furthermore, DGGE bands corresponding to Vagococcus carniphilus, Psychrobacter spp. and Lb. curvatus on the cheese surfaces indicated that these bacterial species {{may play a role in}} cheese ripening...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to specify the relationships between animal species (cow versus goat) and the contents of fat-soluble constituents (fatty acids, carotenoids, retinol and α-tocopherol) in raw milk <b>farmhouse</b> <b>cheeses.</b> Four hundred and thirty-two <b>farmhouse</b> <b>cheeses</b> (74 farms × 6 - 7 cheeses), including 306 cow's milk cheeses and 126 goat's milk cheeses, produced in real herd management conditions throughout the year, were collected. The conditions of milk production were identified beforehand by means of surveys. In order to limit the confounding effects related to the management practices specific to each animal species, the effect of animal species was studied only within cheeses associated with conditions of milk production common to both animal species. Except for C 8 : 0, C 10 : 0 and β-carotene, and to a lesser extent C 4 : 0, the levels of which in cheese clearly differed according to the animal species, the variability within species was higher than the variability between species. Caprine milk fat was on average richer (P 30 % richer) and to a lesser extent C 6 : 0, C 12 : 0 and C 18 : 0 (from 8 to 25 % higher) than bovine milk fat. On the other hand, bovine milk fat was richer (P 30 % richer) and to a lesser extent C 14 : 0, C 16 : 0 and C 18 : 3 n − 3 (from 16 to 23 % richer). Caprine milk fat was completely devoid of β-carotene. In conclusion, the results of this work indicate that, under real herd management conditions, the animal species (cow versus goat) is a strong influencing factor of the nutritional composition of cheese...|$|R

40|$|Unpasteurised {{milk and}} many cheeses contain a diverse {{microbiological}} population. These microorganisms play {{important roles in}} dairy foods and can, for example, {{contribute to the development}} of flavours and aromas, determine safety, cause spoilage or enhance the health of the consumer. It is thus important to understand thoroughly the microorganisms present in these food types. Traditional culture dependent and culture-independent methods have provided much detail regarding the microbial content of dairy foods. However, the development of next-generation DNA sequencing technologies has revolutionised our knowledge of complex microbial environments. Throughout this thesis we observe the benefits of applying these technologies to provide a detailed understanding of the bacterial content of dairy foods, including those present in milk pre- and post-pasteurisation, Irish <b>farmhouse</b> <b>cheeses</b> and commercially produced cheeses which encounter a discolouration defect, as well as to study genomic changes in microbes associated with dairy foods. Through the application of these state-of-the-art technologies we identified the presence of microorganisms not previously associated with dairy foods...|$|R

50|$|Part of the artisanal {{cheese making}} process is aging and {{ripening}} of the cheeses to develop flavor and textural characteristics. One type of artisanal cheese {{is known as}} farmstead cheese, made traditionally with milk from the producer's own herds of cows, sheep, and goats. Artisan cheeses may be made by mixing milk from multiple farms, whereas the more strict definition of farmstead cheese (or <b>farmhouse</b> <b>cheese)</b> requires that milk come only from one farm.|$|E

40|$|Several {{recent studies}} have {{demonstrated}} the existence of robust crossmodal correspondences between food and beverage items and shapes varying on the angular-round continuum. To date, however, the majority of this research has involved relatively simple gustatory, oral-somatosensory, and/or olfactory stimuli. In the present study, therefore, we extended this research in order to investigate whether people also exhibit robust crossmodal correspondences between shapes and cheese. To this end, participants in Experiment 1 (conducted at a Gastronomy event) tasted three aged <b>farmhouse</b> <b>cheeses</b> (Keen's Cheddar, Tunworth, and Berkswell, from Neal's Yard Dairy, UK). Participants rated each cheese using a single response scale anchored at either end by a rounded and an angular shape. Significant differences in shape symbolism were observed across the three cheeses. In Experiments 2 (conducted with cheesemongers and cheese experts) and 3 (conducted with customers in a cheese store), participants separately rated the olfactory, gustatory, and oral-somatosensory attributes of different cheeses (Tunworth, Lancashire, and Stawley) on the angular-round continuum. The results revealed that participants' crossmodal correspondences were based primarily on the taste, rather than the smell or texture of the cheeses. Implications of these findings for the marketing of dairy products are discussed. Practical applications: The {{results of the present}} study demonstrate that taste is the leading contributor to the systematic associations consumers have between the flavors of cheese and certain angular/sharp or organic/round shapes and speech sounds, with the same pattern of crossmodal correspondences being held across different tasting groups (non-experts, regular consumers, and cheesemongers/experts). These results provide insights regarding the abstract imagery that might best be associated with specific taste attributes in commercial cheeses. These results may also be used to not only develop abstract imagery for product packaging that can capture specific shape/sound symbolic properties, but also to develop descriptors that can provide a common ground on which to talk about cheeses, thereby improving communication between different panels of cheese tasters. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|A {{piece of}} {{research}} is presented that {{was conducted on the}} Guayanes <b>Farmhouse</b> Telita <b>Cheese</b> Producers Network located in the Piar and Padre Chien rural municipalities of Bolivar state in Venezuela. Guayanes telita cheese is a regional dairy product. The producers {{are to be found in}} a rural area with a high potential for marketing the label in the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR). This market is the focal point of the strategic importance of this study for the Region and the Country. The research is of a descriptive scope conducted in the field. A questionnaire based on good food production practice was used as a data gathering technique. The final sample comprised 30 production units. Statistical processing was performed with version 15. 2 of the STATGRAPHICS Centurion computational tool. The results would appear to confirm previous studies that point to the existence of factors that prevent these Micro-SMEs from guaranteeing the food safety of the product. The results indicate that new lines of research need to be opened up. These are oriented towards formulating strategies for the continuous improvement of these micro-SMEs, including quality control indicators...|$|R
40|$|Eleven {{strains of}} lactococci {{isolated}} from a <b>farmhouse</b> starter-free <b>cheese</b> manufactured from raw cow's milk were analysed in detail for some technologically-related properties. Large phenotypic differences were encountered between the isolates, {{some of which}} could be of practical relevance. Several strains produced lactic acid at a rate and at a final concentration suitable for large-scale cheesemaking. The enzymatic capabilities assayed with the API ZYM system showed that all strains possess similar profiles with weak proteinase and moderate leucine-arylamidase and esterase-lipase activities. Interestingly, two related strains presented a strong β-galactosidase activity. Plasmid and chromosomal analyses indicated a high degree of diversity among wild strains and showed low homology with some well-known Lactococcus lactis strains. Under highly stringent conditions, only one plasmid from a single strain gave a clear positive hybridization signal with lactococcal-derived probes for the β-phosphogalactosidase and the proteinase genes. In general, wild strains produced more odorous compounds and in higher amounts than the reference strains. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

50|$|There are {{two types}} of Cantal cheese. Cantal Fermier is a <b>farmhouse</b> <b>cheese</b> made of raw milk. Cantal Laitier is the commercial, mass-produced version from pasteurized milk; both have to adhere to the same strict quality controls. Cantal is shaped like a cylinder. Cantal is made from raw or pasteurized cow's milk of the Salers breed. For Cantal, the milk of cows that are fed on hay (during 15 November to 15 April) is used; the summer milk of the same cows grazing on {{mountain}} meadows makes the Salers cheese.|$|E
5000|$|Farmstead cheese, less {{commonly}} known as <b>farmhouse</b> <b>cheese,</b> is produced from the milk collected on the same farm where the cheese is produced. Unlike artisan cheese, which may also include milk purchased and transported from off-farm sources, farmstead cheese makers only use milk from animals they raise. According to the American Cheese Society, [...] "milk used {{in the production of}} farmstead cheeses may not be obtained from any outside source". As a result, the cheeses produced often have unique flavors owing to the farm's local terroir. [...] Most farmstead cheese is produced from cow, goat or sheep milk, although some farmstead cheeses are produced from water buffalo milk (mainly Buffalo mozzarella).|$|E
50|$|Abbaye de Belloc is a French Pyrenees, {{traditional}} <b>farmhouse,</b> semi-hard <b>cheese</b> {{from the}} Pays Basque region, made from unpasteurized sheep milk, with a fat content of 60%. The cheese is still {{made in the}} traditional manner by the Benedictine monks of the Abbaye de Notre-Dame de Belloc, at the commune of Belloc in the Ariège department of southwestern France. Production of this Ossau-Iraty cheese is regulated by A.O.C. laws. Abbaye is produced from the milk of a centuries-old breed of red-nosed Manech ewes, particular to the Basque region, delivered by farms neighboring the Belloc Monastery. It is believed that these Benedictine monks {{were the first to}} teach shepherds from the Basque region how to make cheese many centuries ago. Abbaye de Belloc has a pleasantly nutty and complex flavor that is characteristic of Basque, and is made in a 5 kg fat wheel with a natural, crusty, brownish colored rind with patches of red, orange and yellow. This semi-firm cheese has a dense, rich and creamy texture and a distinctive lanolin aroma. Careful attention under the correct maturing conditions accentuates this cheese's rich, caramelized flavors, which sometime resemble burnt caramel, that can make Abbaye de Belloc so addictive. It pairs particularly well with Pinot Noir, as it is mild enough not to overwhelm the subtleties of this delicate varietal, but also has sufficient complexity {{to stand up to the}} bolder flavors of a Syrah/Shiraz.|$|R
40|$|The {{microbial}} {{composition of}} smear-ripened cheeses {{is not very}} clear. A total of 194 bacterial isolates and 187 yeast isolates from the surfaces of four Irish <b>farmhouse</b> smear-ripened <b>cheeses</b> were identified at the midpoint of ripening using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), repetitive sequence-based PCR, and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing for identifying and typing the bacteria and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and mitochondrial DNA {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (mtDNA RFLP) analysis for identifying and typing the yeast. The yeast microflora was very uniform, and Debaryomyces hansenii was the dominant species in the four cheeses. Yarrowia lipolytica was also isolated in low numbers from one cheese. The bacteria were highly diverse, and 14 different species, Corynebacterium casei, Corynebacterium variabile, Arthrobacter arilaitensis, Arthrobacter sp., Microbacterium gubbeenense, Agrococcus sp. nov., Brevibacterium linens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus equorum, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Micrococcus luteus, Halomonas venusta, Vibrio sp., and Bacillus sp., were identified on the four cheeses. Each cheese had a more or less unique microflora with four to nine species on its surface. However, two bacteria, C. casei and A. arilaitensis, were found on each cheese. Diversity at the strain level was also observed, based on the different PFGE patterns and mtDNA RFLP profiles of the dominant bacterial and yeast species. None of the ripening cultures deliberately inoculated onto the surface were reisolated from the cheeses. This study confirms the importance of the adventitious, resident microflora in the ripening of smear cheeses...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} the lipid and volatile fractions of three commercially available, <b>farmhouse</b> sheep <b>cheeses</b> from Chile (Chilozabal, Patagonia and Quillahue cheeses) as a preliminary contribution to know, promote, protect and improve their quality. Two cheese samples of each type of cheese were purchased in specialty stores in the capital city: Patagonia, Quillahue, and two different fabrications of Chilozabal cheese (two different stores). Significant differences in the total fatty acid amounts were observed among the cheeses. Quillahue cheese had the highest content of unsaturated and branched-chain fatty acids and the lowest value of the atherogenic index. Chilozabal cheese showed the highest content of CLA and vaccenic acid. The total amount of free fatty acids was highest in one of the Chilozabal cheeses and 85 % lower in Quillahue. Short-chain FFA represented 58 % of the total FFA in both Chilozabal cheeses, suggesting the use of pregastric lipase-containing lamb rennet paste. In Quillahue and Patagonia cheeses, short-chain FFA were 42 % of the total FFA, consistent with the use of commercial rennets without lipase activity. The volatile composition of these cheeses was rather similar to that of other well-known hard and semi-hard sheep cheeses. Volatile acids were the most abundant compounds in all cheeses and significant differences were found in the content of esters, ketones and alcohols among the cheeses. Compositional differences among the Chilean sheep cheeses were essentially due to breed, feed management, and technological factors...|$|R
