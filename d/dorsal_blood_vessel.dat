5000|$|The {{exterior}} {{of an individual}} segment is a thin cuticle over skin, commonly pigmented red to brown, which has specialized cells that secrete mucus over the cuticle to keep the body moist and ease movement through soil. Under the skin is a layer of nerve tissue, and two layers of muscles—a thin outer layer of circular muscle, and a much thicker inner layer of longitudinal muscle. Interior to the muscle layer is a fluid-filled chamber called a coelom that by its pressurization provides structure to the worm's boneless body. The segments are separated from each other by transverse dividing walls called [...] "septa" [...] (singular [...] "septum") that are perforated, allowing the coelomic fluid to pass between segments. A pair of structures called nephrostomes are located {{at the back of}} each septum; a nephric tubule leads from each nephrostome through the septum and into the following segment. This tubule then leads to the main body fluid filtering organ, the nephridium or metanephridium, which removes metabolic waste from the coelomic fluid and expels it through pores called nephridiopores on the worm's sides; usually two nephridia (sometimes more) are found in most segments. At the center of a worm is the digestive tract, which runs straight through from mouth to anus without coiling, and is flanked above and below by blood vessels (the <b>dorsal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> and the ventral blood vessel as well as a subneural blood vessel) and the ventral nerve cord, and is surrounded in each segment by a pair of pallial blood vessels that connect the dorsal to the subneural blood vessels.|$|E

40|$|In the {{dorsal horn}} of the spinal cord, {{activation}} of small fibre nociceptive afferents {{leads to the}} release of nitric oxide and enkephalins by interneurons. In this work we encountered unexpected relationships among local spinal cord <b>dorsal</b> horn <b>blood</b> flow, specific forms of afferent input, nitric oxide and intrinsic opioids. Selective rises in rat lumbar <b>dorsal</b> cord <b>blood</b> flow using laser Doppler flowmetry and microelectrode hydrogen clearance polarography were generated by ipsilateral, ‘nociceptive’ low (3 Hz) frequency stimulation of sciatic afferents. Inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) prevented rises in flow during stimulation without influencing baseline flow. Ipsilateral hindpaw intradermal injection of capsaicin, a nociceptive activator, also generated large rises in flow sensitive to NOS inhibition. During NOS blockade or morphine administration there were unexpected acute declines in the <b>dorsal</b> cord <b>blood</b> flow strictly confined to low frequency stimulation epochs. This acute vasoconstrictive effect was prevented by administration of an opioid receptor antagonist. Using immunohistochemistry, terminals apparently innervating <b>dorsal</b> spinal cord <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> were labelled with antibodies against neuronal NOS and met-enkephalin. We conclude that local nitric oxide and opioids, probably from interneurons, have competitive actions on dorsal horn microvessels once interneurons are activated during a nociceptive barrage.
