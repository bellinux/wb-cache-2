25|$|Fulci and screenwriter Dardano Sacchetti {{share many}} screen credits from 1977 to 1983. Indeed, most of Fulci's most celebrated horror films {{were written by}} Sacchetti. After collaborating with Sacchetti for six years, Fulci went off on his own in 1983 to direct Conquest in Mexico, failing to involve Sacchetti in the deal. The film was {{supposed}} to be a high budget production, and Sacchetti allegedly resented the fact that Fulci had not thought to involve him in the project. The film actually wound up <b>doing</b> <b>quite</b> poorly upon its release, and afterwards, Fulci had trouble jump-starting his working relationship with Sacchetti, who by this time had gone his own way.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1986, NBC was <b>doing</b> <b>quite</b> well in the ratings with its Thursday night lineup but was still {{experiment}}ing on other nights. One such experiment was the anthology series The New Alfred Hitchcock Presents featuring new stories introduced by colorized vintage footage of Alfred Hitchcock. After just one season on the network, the show was cancelled abruptly after the July 20, 1986 airing of two repeat episodes placed 55th for the week in the Nielsen ratings against 5th-rated Murder, She Wrote on CBS. [...] Needing an inexpensive replacement on short notice as a fill-in until the 1986-87 television season started in September, NBC began airing one-hour episodes of Dalton, re-titled Dalton's Code of Vengeance, in a four-episode limited run beginning on July 27, 1986.|$|E

In {{an interview with}} the Oxford Student [...] he stated that he [...] "did not really enjoy the English course" [...] and that [...] "I thought I was <b>doing</b> <b>quite</b> well until I came out with my third class degree and then I realised that I wasn’t — it was the year they stopped giving fourth class degrees otherwise I’d have got one of those". He discovered William Blake's illustrations around 1970, which would also later influence him greatly.|$|E

[...] Batting just before lunch on day 3 having fielded for 2 days as Australia made 600 at Trent Bridge in 1989, Moxon faced a near impossible ball from Terry Alderman which swung considerably and he was caught at second slip - Moxon <b>doing</b> <b>quite</b> well to edge it. [...] In the second innings he received a [...] "grub hunter" [...] (a ball that kept very low) to be bowled. [...] Moxon never played for England again.|$|E

[...] In his book, , Aiken said, [...] "It's a Southern tradition to be given your first name from your grandmama's maiden name." [...] Aiken's middle name came from his paternal grandmother's maiden name; he and Foster used the married surnames of their mothers to name their son.|$|E

2500|$|Although the Chinese let up on reforms, they {{continued}} {{military operations in}} the areas in rebellion, causing thousands of refugees to gather around Lhasa. In July 1957, the Dalai Lama hosted a large ceremony in the Potala Palace, during which he accepted a golden throne and petition from representatives of the Chushi Gangdruk movement and in return gave them a blessing touch on their foreheads, and issued them with a talisman. They would soon become a 5,000-man strong [...] "Defenders of the Faith Volunteer Army" [...] {{under the leadership of}} Gompo Tashi Andrugtsang that would struggle against the Chinese for years. However, in September 1957 when the first two CIA trainees dropped into Tibet to deliver a message from the CIA offering support to the Tibetan leader, it was refused. The second drop of four men was disastrous: only one managed to escape alive. Meanwhile, by 1958 Gompo's army was <b>doing</b> <b>quite</b> well taking control of large portions of central Tibet.|$|E
2500|$|The term noun has a {{narrower}} purview and is detached from {{any notion of}} entity description. For instance, the words bit/bits {{in a bit of}} time, a little bit of peanut butter, and bits of information can be understood as a noun, but they can hardly be understood as representing some entity on its own. In that sense, these words shall be understood as being the head of a [...] "noun phrase" [...] in a formalist account of grammar, but as a portion of some unbounded entity in a nominal group. Since formal linguists are interested in the recurring patterns of word classes such as [...] "a" [...] + [...] "" [...] and not in the way humans describe entities, they recruit the term [...] "noun phrase" [...] for their grammatical descriptions, a structure defined as a pattern around a noun, and not as a way of describing an entity such as the [...] "nominal group". In other words, given the different architectures of language that are assumed by functional and formal theories of language, the terms [...] "noun phrase" [...] and [...] "nominal group" [...] must be seen to be <b>doing</b> <b>quite</b> different descriptive work.|$|E
