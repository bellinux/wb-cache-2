5000|$|Some {{developing}} countries {{have argued that}} a global <b>Green</b> New <b>Deal</b> may undermine national sovereignty regarding a country's control over its natural resources. Brazil, Mexico, and India have emphasized national sovereignty when discussing the <b>Green</b> New <b>Deal,</b> with India also expressing fears of a green [...] "economic straitjacket". Bolivia, on its part, has argued that a <b>Green</b> New <b>Deal</b> may signal the [...] "privatization and commodification of nature". China, while voicing some support for a <b>Green</b> New <b>Deal,</b> {{also pointed out that}} it may result in [...] "trade protectionism under the pretext of environmental protection".|$|R
30|$|In April 2009, UNDP {{published}} a report titled A Global <b>Green</b> New <b>Deal</b> and expounded {{on the basic}} content of the program. The <b>Green</b> New <b>Deal</b> announced by President Obama covered many aspects like energy conservation, efficiency increases, new energy exploitation, and tackling climate change, among which was new energy exploitation as {{the core of the}} Deal. With his New Deal, President Obama was even called as the First Green American President. In the UK, the <b>Green</b> New <b>Deal</b> pushed the economic development towards a low-carbon orientation.|$|R
40|$|Voluntary {{environmental}} agreements (VEAs) are attracting considerable attention {{due to the}} complexity of the current environmental issues. Fostering collaboration between public and private parties is considered an effective means for achieving sustainable development goals. Even though VEAs have been studied in the past, little research has focused on the novel and successful agreements from the Netherlands (<b>Green</b> <b>Deals)</b> and the UK (WRAP agreements). Thus, this study aims at filling this gap of knowledge by exploring the way the Dutch <b>Green</b> <b>Deals</b> and WRAP agreements work and how their efficiency is measured. The data in this qualitative study was collected through theme interviews. In total eight experts from the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment (3), the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in the UK (2), WRAP (2) and a consulting company in the Netherlands (1) were interviewed. The data was analyzed through thematic analysis. The study focused on exploring the development, implementation, and performance phases of the agreements. The added value and the key differences of the studied phenomena were also examined. According to the research findings, the <b>Green</b> <b>Deals</b> and WRAP agreements promote active knowledge sharing and learning. Furthermore, governments prefer to use voluntary approaches for tacking environmental issues and for achieving progress through collaboration and innovation. Critical factors for successful implementation of the agreements are ambition, sharing, communication, access to expertise, trust and respect...|$|R
25|$|The <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> {{provided}} {{low interest}} loans for energy efficiency {{improvements to the}} energy bills of the properties the upgrades are performed on. These debts are passed onto new occupiers when they take over the payment of energy bills. The costs of the loan repayments should be less than the savings on the bills from the upgrades, however {{this will be a}} guideline and not legally enforceable guarantee. It is believed that tying repayment to energy bills will give investors a secure return.|$|E
50|$|The {{registers}} of <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> Installers, <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> Assessors, <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> Advisers and <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> Providers became {{active at}} the launch. Property Assessments {{can now be}} undertaken by <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> Assessor Organisations (GDAO) and Installations under the Energy Company Obligation can now take place by certified installers. Following this, the first <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> Plans were available from 28 January 2013. Although the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) stated that the first <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> plans would not be confirmed until January 2013, <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> Assessments performed by <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> Advisors took place from 1 October 2012. DECC proposes tying low interest loans of estimated 7%, issued by <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> Providers for energy efficiency improvements to the energy bills of the properties the upgrades are performed on. These debts would then be passed onto new occupiers when they take over the payment of the bills. However, recent reports show {{a high number of}} UK energy customers are in considerable debt.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> Advisor {{has to be}} {{employed}} to perform an inspection of the property to provide a report on advised energy improvement measures. A <b>green</b> <b>deal</b> advice report is only valid when produced by a <b>green</b> <b>deal</b> advisor that complies with (NOS) standards. The funding for these measures is then issued by the <b>green</b> <b>deal</b> finance company (GDFC); following this the <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> Provider and a <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> Installer will install the measures. It is hoped the <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> {{will lead to the}} renovation of the UK's housing stock with an estimated 14 million homes seeing energy efficiency improvements ranging from; double glazing, cavity wall and loft insulation through to gas and oil boilers, and renewable technologies such as solar PV, solar thermal and heat pumps.|$|E

The amendment states that The Secretary of State will report to parliament on proposals for an apprenticeships scheme within the <b>Green</b> <b>Deal.</b> She later criticised the <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> saying in the Independent [...] "Because of sky-high interest rates, hidden charges and penalty payments, the reality for most people will be that the <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> ends up costing them more than they save." ...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> was {{included}} in the Energy Act 2011 and came into force on 1 October 2012. DECC announced a list of pioneer <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> providers in April 2012. Twenty two providers, including three of the biggest six energy companies and B&Q, (the only high street name) have signed a declaration stating they intend to become <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> Providers, once DECC had appointed the <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> Oversight Body. Other expected providers such as Tesco, Marks and Spencer and the other three major energy companies were missing from the list. Fears of low take up of the <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> has led Government to budget Â£200 million to encourage early uptake. The policy caused a rift in the Coalition Government in April 2012. Senior Conservative ministers, including Eric Pickles ( [...] Communities and Local Government Secretary), called for the scheme to be scrapped as it could cost the so-called [...] "squeezed" [...] middle, thousands of pounds. The <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> will rely on the Consumer Credit Act to provide safeguards for those taking out <b>green</b> <b>deal</b> loans.|$|E

30|$|Transforming {{economic}} development mode and developing green economy require systemic guarantees. In China, systemic guarantee means implementing a <b>Green</b> New <b>Deal.</b> This borrows the concept from the United Nations (UN) and is {{for its own}} needs. UNEP initiated the Global <b>Green</b> New <b>Deal</b> in October 2008. It states that the twenty-first century represents a historic moment for focusing investment on environmental protection, which will ensure economic prosperity and create job opportunities. At the United Nations Climate Change Conference (December 11, 2008) and World Environment Day event (June 2009), Ban Ki-moon, the UN Secretary-General, {{stressed the importance of}} the <b>Green</b> New <b>Deal</b> several times. He stated that the world needs a <b>Green</b> New <b>Deal</b> that focuses on investment in renewable resources, building environmentally friendly infrastructure, and increasing energy efficiency. He stated that today's crisis could be transformed into tomorrow's sustainable growth if part of the economic stimulus packages was invested in the green economy.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} attract investors, the <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> {{may need to}} be altered, compromising its {{original}} objective. The range of investors it had been assumed would underpin the <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> would require returns of 11%-15%, thus there is a 4-8 percentage point shortfall between what is needed to make the <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> attractive to investors and what the Government has set as the loan interest rate.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Green</b> New <b>Deal</b> in Poland - this {{campaign}} encompasses two books [...] "Green New Deal in Poland" [...] and [...] "Green New Deal - social" [...] {{and a series}} of public debates in several Polish cities with politicians and specialists in the given area. The book discusses <b>Green</b> New <b>Deal</b> in the world and in Europe, <b>Green</b> New <b>Deal</b> as a tool to balance economy, society and natural environment. It covers areas such as: green transport (mobility), electric vehicles, decentralized energy systems, smart grid 2.0, micro-generation, thermo-renovation, agriculture and sustainable development of rural areas, sustainable water and resource management, climate policy as a tool to modernize the economy and the society. Emphasis is put on women, their equal chances in the <b>Green</b> New <b>Deal</b> policy (employment, quota policies, the status in politics and business). The book examines the problem of energy efficiency, low-energy and autonomous buildings, eco-innovations, green technologies, potential of green jobs etc. Additionally, education and climate democracy are discussed through the âGreen-New-Deal-lensesâ.|$|R

50|$|The high {{interest}} {{rate of the}} <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> has been extensively criticized since it was revealed at the scheme's launch. Interest rates of more than 7% are significantly higher than available high street loans. This has led to some <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> providers such as Npower raising concerns about the high rates, adding that, unless they were reduced, the scheme would fail. The {{high interest}} rate has raised concerns that the <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> will not meet its golden rule.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> {{policy was}} {{outlined}} in 2010 by the Conservative Party. The {{amount of the}} loans would be of up to Â£6,500. After a series of setbacks, a renewed <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> was launched on 28 January 2013, with mixed results.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> {{does not}} offer any {{subsidies}} or grants for home insulation. Instead {{a new type of}} loan is provided which is attached to the property rather than the individual who takes out the loan. The purchaser of property becomes liable for the loan taken out to insulate the property. The <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> policy has met substantial criticism. In 2013, the Telegraph wrote that the high rate of interest charged for loans taken out under the <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> will mean there will be insignificant take-up, and hence the policy will be ineffective.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the time}} of creation, the <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> was praised as ârevolutionary,â its {{initiators}} setting very high targets. The government expected that 14 million homes could benefit from it until 2020, that investments could reach Â£10 billion, and that 65,000 jobs could be created. However, in 2012, numbers in take-up rates were greatly disappointing, making the <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> look like it was âdoomed to fail.â The <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> principle relied on take-up by the market, which was greatly criticized for having ânever worked {{anywhere in the world}} â¦ and unlikely to happen in the UK." ...|$|E
5000|$|It {{is not yet}} {{entirely clear}} what kind of legal entity is applied by Land Registry {{documentation}} to properties that have received <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> loans, or how the mortgage providers will treat those properties when the property is resold or remortgaged. The Council of Mortgage Lenders have issued guidelines, but have stated [...] "Lenders will make their own individual commercial decisions {{in response to the}} <b>Green</b> <b>Deal,</b> and these may vary." [...] Furthermore, within the background documentation the final paragraph raises questions around the core functionality of the deal: [...] "It is not altogether clear why consumers will be attracted by <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> finance at not especially low interest rates. In addition, since the golden rule is to be met only âon averageâ, in some cases energy bill savings might not cover the cost of the <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> measures and plan. There are therefore considerable concerns about take up of the Green Deal." [...] The CML has also expressed concern over a lender's liability for <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> finance in the case of mortgage default.|$|E
5000|$|There {{has also}} been doubts cast over whether the central tenet of the scheme - the {{so-called}} [...] "Golden Rule" [...] whereby the cost of repayments never outweighs the savings on the bill - will actually be successfully implemented. There is also criticism that it will only benefit {{the middle class and}} not be of any help to those most in need and the working class. The <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> {{has also been}} criticized by the Citizens Advice Bureau for its lack of protection for consumers, particularly those inheriting a <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> when taking over a property The policy has also been criticized by senior Conservative MPs, when it was revealed that for any work on a property to get planning permission it would also be forced to take on a <b>Green</b> <b>Deal.</b> This has been dubbed a 'conservatory tax' by the media. Consumer Focus has also raised concerns about the lack of consumer redress, particularly for those who inherit a <b>Green</b> <b>Deal.</b> This secondary mis-selling would mean that unless the <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> provider issued a transferable warranty for the works under current contract law, the new occupiers who had not agreed the original contract would be unable to get compensation or repairs if the <b>Green</b> <b>Deal</b> installation was later found to be faulty, for example causes damp.|$|E
