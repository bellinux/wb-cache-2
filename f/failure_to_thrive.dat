5|$|The {{name of the}} {{disorder}} emphasizes problems with attachment but the criteria includes symptoms such as <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>thrive,</b> a lack of developmentally appropriate social responsiveness, apathy, and onset before 8 months.|$|E
5|$|Pediatricians {{are often}} the first health {{professionals}} to assess and raise suspicions of RAD in children with the disorder. The initial presentation varies according to the child's developmental and chronological age, although it always involves a disturbance in social interaction. Infants up to about 18–24 months may present with non-organic <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>thrive</b> and display abnormal responsiveness to stimuli. Laboratory investigations will be unremarkable barring possible findings consistent with malnutrition or dehydration, while serum growth hormone levels will be normal or elevated.|$|E
5|$|Reactive {{attachment}} disorder {{first made}} its appearance in standard nosologies of psychological disorders in DSM-III, 1980, following {{an accumulation of}} evidence on institutionalized children. The criteria included a requirement of onset {{before the age of}} 8 months and was equated with <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>thrive.</b> Both these features were dropped in DSM-III-R, 1987. Instead, onset was changed to being within the first 5 years of life and the disorder itself was divided into two subcategories, inhibited and disinhibited. These changes resulted from further research on maltreated and institutionalized children and remain in the current version, DSM-IV, 1994, and its 2000 text revision, DSM-IV-TR, as well as in ICD-10, 1992. Both nosologies focus on young children who are not merely at increased risk for subsequent disorders but are already exhibiting clinical disturbance.|$|E
40|$|Missional {{communities}} are failing. Missional {{communities are}} failing {{because they do}} not contextualize the nature, function, and historical forms of the church. Specifically, missional communities fail due to lack of leadership, gospel proclamation, incarnational living to a particular people, and mission dependence on the Holy Spirit. All of these things stem from not putting the nature, function, and historical forms of the church before modern forms. Missional communities will begin <b>to</b> <b>thrive</b> if communities will not just copy forms of other missional churches, but if they will contextualize the nature, functions, and historical forms of the church in their own settings. A thriving missional community will have trained leaders who lead their communities to live in unity, proclaim the gospel, live out Jesus incarnationally to a particular people, and practice dependence on the Holy Spirit. In this written statement we will first look at the pitfalls that cause missional communities to fail. Then we will look at the approaches churches have taken {{to address the problem of}} missional communities failing. We will then explore ways in which we can move from <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>thriving</b> as a missional community. This paper will describe a program that addresses the issues of missional communities failing through a comprehensive coaching process. The coaching process will help leaders avoid the pitfalls that lead <b>to</b> <b>failure,</b> helping them <b>to</b> install practices that lead <b>to</b> a <b>thriving</b> missional community...|$|R
25|$|Symptoms vary {{according}} to the abnormality, but often feature poor muscle tone and motor function, seizures, developmental delays, mental retardation, <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> grow and <b>thrive,</b> difficulties with feeding, swelling in the extremities, and a smaller than normal head. Most infants with an NMD appear normal, but some disorders have characteristic facial or skull features that can be recognized by a neurologist.|$|R
40|$|Congenital clefts {{and other}} malformations of the atlas are {{incidental}} findings identified while investigating the cervical spine following trauma. A persistent bifid anterior and posterior arch of the atlas beyond {{the age of}} 3 – 4  years is observed in skeletal dysplasias, Goldenhar syndrome, Conradi syndrome, and Down’s syndrome. There is {{a high incidence of}} both anterior and posterior spina bifida of the atlas in patients with metabolic disorders, such as Morquio’s syndrome [Baraitser and Winter in London dysmorphology database, Oxford University Press, 2005; Torriani, Lourenco in Rev Hosp Clin Fac Med Sao Paulo 53 : 73 – 76, 2002]. We report two siblings and their mother, with congenital, persistent torticollis, plagiocephaly, facial asymmetry, grooved tongues, and asymptomatic “dolicho-odontoid process”. All are of normal intelligence. No associated Neurological dysfunction, paresis, apnoea, or <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> <b>thrive</b> were encountered. Radiographs of the cervical spine were non-contributory, but 3 D CT scanning of this area allowed further visualisation of the cervico–cranial malformation complex in this family and might possibly explain the sudden early juvenile mortality. Agenesis of the posterior arch of the atlas and bifidity/clefting of anterior arch of the atlas associated with asymptomatic “dolicho-odontoid process” were the hallmark in the proband and his female sibling. Some of the features were present in the mother. All the family subjects were investigated. To {{the best of our knowledge}} the constellation of malformation complex in this family has not been previously reported...|$|R

25|$|Individuals with CS appear prematurely {{aged and}} exhibit severe growth {{retardation}} leading to short stature. They {{have a small}} head (less than the -3 standard deviation), fail to gain weight and <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>thrive.</b> They also have extreme cutaneous photosensitivity (sensitivity to sunlight), neurodevelopmental abnormalities, and deafness, and often exhibit lipoatrophy, atrophic skin, severe tooth decay, sparse hair, calcium deposits in neurons, cataracts, sensorineural hearing loss, pigmentary retinopathy, and bone abnormalities. However, {{they do not have}} a higher risk of cancer.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} manifestations of primary antibody deficiencies is gastrointestinal disorders. In this study we reviewed 83 patients including 25 with X-Linked agamma¬globulinemia. 40 with common variable immunodeficiency, 14 with IgA defi¬ciency and 4 with IgG subclass deficiency. The mean age of patients was 10 year (l- 28 yr). The ratio of male to female was 1. 5. Gastrointestinal system was affected {{in more than half}} (57. 8 %) of them. The most common symptom was diarrhea (56. 6 %o) and the most prevalent pathogen was. G. Lamblia. Other disorders were chronic active hepatitis in 6 patients, ulcerative colitis in 2, small intestinal villus atrophy in 5, nodular lymphoid hyperplasia of small in¬testine in 3 and chronic gastritis in 4 patients. One patient suffered from abdomi¬nal lymphoma. We found a direct correlation between <b>failure</b> of patients <b>to</b> <b>thrive</b> and the duration of the delay in diagnosing the underlying disease. This difference was more apparent in those with both antibody deficiency and gastrointestinal involve¬ment...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{contamination}} by {{agricultural chemicals}} and industrial waste disposal results in {{adverse effects on}} reproduction of exposed birds. The diversity of pollutants results in physiological effects at several levels, including direct effects on breeding adults as well as developmental effects on embryos. The effects on embryos include mortality or reduced hatchability, <b>failure</b> of chicks <b>to</b> <b>thrive</b> (wasting syndrome), and teratological effects producing skeletal abnormalities and impaired differentiation of the reproductive and nervous systems through mechanisms of hormonal mimicking of estrogens. The range of chemical effects on adult birds covers acute mortality, sublethal stress, reduced fertility, suppression of egg formation, eggshell thinning, and impaired incubation and chick rearing behaviors. The types of pollutants shown to cause reproductive effects include organochlorine pesticides and industrial pollutants, organophosphate pesticides, petroleum hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and in a fewer number of reports, herbicides, and fungicides. o,p'-DDT, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and mixtures of organochlorines {{have been identified as}} environmental estrogens affecting populations of gulls breeding in polluted "hot spots " in southern California, the Great Lakes, and Puget Sound. Estrogenic organochlorines represent an important class of toxicants to birds because differentiation of the avian reproductive system is estroge...|$|R
30|$|Composting {{plants have}} {{experienced}} {{two kinds of}} technical failures: first, {{the failure of the}} mechanical systems those manipulate waste streams before biological process starts; second, the failure of the decomposition process itself mainly attributable <b>to</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> create an environment for the biological process <b>to</b> <b>thrive.</b> The technological <b>failure</b> of composting is primarily a failure of the mechanical pre-processing systems. The large-scale composting facilities with the complex mechanical pre-processing to remove non-compostable materials have largely failed at their tasks. There is hardly any mechanical system which could ever adequately identify and separate all of the materials in the mixed waste to ensure the production of good-quality compost. In addition, there is a failure in the composting process itself due <b>to</b> the <b>failure</b> in understanding the nature of biological processes. Compost bacteria, insects, and microorganisms require certain environmental conditions <b>to</b> <b>thrive.</b> If these conditions are absent or interrupted, it badly affects the composting process and its quality.|$|R
25|$|Infection in newborns is {{particularly}} severe. Pertussis is fatal in an estimated 1.6% of hospitalized US infants under {{one year of}} age. First-year infants {{are also more likely}} to develop complications, such as: pneumonia (20%), encephalopathy (0.3%), seizures (1%), <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>thrive,</b> and death (1%)—perhaps due to the ability of the bacterium to suppress the immune system. Pertussis can cause severe paroxysm-induced cerebral hypoxia, and 50% of infants admitted to hospital suffer apneas. Reported fatalities from pertussis in infants increased substantially from 1990 to 2010.|$|E
500|$|Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) {{deficiency}} {{leads to}} adrenal insufficiency, {{a lack of}} production of glucocorticoids such as cortisol by the adrenal gland. If the problem is chronic, symptoms consist of fatigue, weight loss, <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>thrive</b> (in children), delayed puberty (in adolescents), hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels), anemia and hyponatremia (low sodium levels). If the onset is abrupt, collapse, shock and vomiting may occur. [...] ACTH deficiency is highly similar to primary Addison's disease, which is cortisol deficiency {{as the result of}} direct damage to the adrenal glands; the latter form, however, often leads to hyperpigmentation of the skin, which does not occur in ACTH deficiency.|$|E
500|$|The {{opening of}} East European orphanages {{in the early}} 1990s {{following}} the end of the Cold War provided substantial opportunities for research on attachment and other aspects of institutional rearing, however such research rarely mentions [...] "maternal deprivation" [...] other than in a historical context. Maternal deprivation as a discrete syndrome is a concept that is rarely used other than in connection with extreme deprivation and <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>thrive.</b> Rather there is consideration of a range of different lacks and deficiencies in different forms of care, or lack of care, of which attachment is only one aspect, as well as consideration of constitutional and genetic factors in determining developmental outcome. Subsequent studies have however confirmed Bowlby's concept of [...] "cycles of disadvantage" [...] although not all children from unhappy homes reproduce the deficiencies in their own experience. Rather, it is now conceptualised as a series of pathways through childhood and a number of varied influences will determine which path a particular child takes.|$|E
40|$|Sarcocystis {{species are}} {{intracellular}} protozoan parasites with an intermediate-definitive host life cycle {{based on a}} prey-predator relationship. Asexual stages develop in intermediate hosts after they ingest the oocyst stage from definitive-host feces and terminate {{with the formation of}} intramuscular cysts (sarcocysts). Sarcocysts in meat eaten by a definitive host initiate sexual stages in the intestine that terminate in oocysts excreted in the feces. Most Sarcocystis species infect specific hosts or closely related host species. For example, humans and some primates are definitive hosts for Sarcocystis hominis and S. suihominis after eating raw meat from cattle and pigs, respectively. The prevalence of intestinal sarcocystosis in humans is low and is only rarely associated with illness, except in volunteers who ingest large numbers of sarcocysts. Cases of infection of humans as intermediate hosts, with intramuscular cysts, number less than 100 and are of unknown origin. The asexual stages, including sarcocysts, can stimulate a strong inflammatory response. Livestock have suffered acute debilitating infections, resulting in abortion and death or chronic infections with <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> grow or <b>thrive.</b> This review provides a summary of Sarcocystis biology, including its morphology, life cycle, host specificity, prevalence, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies, for human and food animal infections...|$|R

After the partner organization prepares a proposal for funding and it is approved, a Water <b>to</b> <b>Thrive</b> well-building campaign is launched in the United States. Campaigns are sponsored by churches, schools, individuals, or any interested group. Their goal is to raise $5,000 to build one well. Once the well is funded, building begins and can take 18-24 months. Water <b>to</b> <b>Thrive</b> and well sponsors are sent regular progress and completion reports.

40|$|<b>Failures</b> <b>to</b> {{establish}} coherent 				legal {{regimes and}} workable market systems, often {{in developing countries}} and 				those transitioning from non-market economies, have led <b>to</b> <b>thriving</b> informal 				economies. In such, the costs are simply 				lower for the individual to remain outside of the law. By analyzing the informal phenomenon, its 				consequences, and effects upon {{many of the most}} important human rights, it is 				demonstrated that virtually the entire human rights corpus is frustrated by the 				idea of people living outside of the law. 				When people do not participate in the formal legal system in any 				meaningful way and have no real legal protections, human rights guarantees 				become little more than unfulfilled promises...|$|R

2500|$|Additional {{congenital}} anomalies, {{effects on}} other organs, and less common features of JBS have included: imperforate anus (occlusion of the anus), vesicoureteral reflux (reversal {{of the flow}} of urine, from the bladder back into the ureters, toward the kidneys); [...] of the uterus and vagina in female infants, neonatal cholestasis of the liver, with cirrhosis and portal hypertension (high blood pressure in the hepatic portal vein); dilated cardiomyopathy, dextrocardia (congenital displacement of the heart to {{the right side of the}} chest), atrial and ventricular septal defect; low birth-weight, <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>thrive,</b> hypotonia (decreased muscle tone); sacral hiatus (a structural deficiency of the sacral vertebrae), congenital cataracts, and cafe-au-lait spots.|$|E
2500|$|In other animals, {{riboflavin}} deficiency {{results in}} lack of growth, <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>thrive,</b> and eventual death. Experimental riboflavin deficiency in dogs results in growth failure, weakness, ataxia, and inability to stand. The animals collapse, become comatose, and die. During the deficiency state, dermatitis develops together with hair loss. Other signs include corneal opacity, lenticular cataracts, hemorrhagic adrenals, fatty degeneration of the kidney and liver, and inflammation of the mucous membrane of the gastrointestinal tract. Post-mortem studies in rhesus monkeys fed a riboflavin-deficient diet revealed about one-third the normal amount of riboflavin was present in the liver, which is the main storage organ for riboflavin in mammals.
