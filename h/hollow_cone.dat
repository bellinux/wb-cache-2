500|$|The latest {{generation}} Planar 3, released in 2016, is a wholesale improvement on the classic. Rega reports that only 2 part assemblies remain unchanged from the prior RP3 model, the dustcover and dustcover hinges. Significant revisions to plinth, platter, tonearm show net improvements in fit and finish, {{as well as}} performance. The new plinth is an MDF core with a high-pressure acrylic laminate finish, and thicker braces, for improved strength and aesthetics, lowering noise floor and improving response. The main bearing well has been completely redesigned to reduce pressure on the ball bearing and hub, while allowing for a higher tolerance assembly, netting smoother operation and lower noise. A new hub (subplatter) is constructed of polycarbonate, reshaped to improve contact with the platter and lower overall resonance of the main bearing/hub/platter assembly. The 12mm platter is a new glass material, dubbed Optiwhite, is noticeably clearer in appearance and {{is said to be}} machined to higher tolerance which improves rotational stability. The old RB303 tonearm {{has been replaced by a}} new RB330 version of the classic, with patent pending [...] "zero-tolerance" [...] bearings, stiffer vertical bearing housing, redesigned bias (anti-skate) housing, improved three-point plinth mounting, a new arm tube coating, and new arm wiring. The 24V AC synchronous motor has a new control PCB and housing cover for greater consistency during assembly and improved reliability, and the power switch has been relocated under the plinth for better ergonomics. New feet are said to lower noise transfer into the turntable, via a new stiffer, wider, <b>hollow</b> <b>cone</b> design constructed from Santoprene rubber. As always, the Planar 3 is still produced in Rega's UK manufacturing plant located in Southend-on-Sea, Essex UK. Remarkably, the 2016 Planar 3 only rose in price nominally from its predecessor, revealing the benefits of Rega's increased manufacturing capacity and popularity.|$|E

The influence of sputtering conditions on the formation and development of bioglass cones was studied. It was shown that larger populations of well-developed cones could be achieved by increasing the argon sputtering pressure.

40|$|We {{consider}} banana shaped regions {{as examples}} of compact regions, whose boundary has two conical singularities. Their regularised holographic entropy is calculated with all divergent as well as finite terms. The coefficient of the squared logarithmic divergence, also {{in such a case}} with internally curved boundary, agrees with that calculated in the literature for infinite circular cones with their internally flat boundary. For the otherwise conformally invariant coefficient of the ordinary logarithmic divergence an anomaly under exceptional conformal transformations is observed. The construction of minimal submanifolds, needed for the entanglement entropy of cones, requires fine-tuning of Cauchy data. Perturbations of such fine-tuning leads to solutions relevant for <b>hollow</b> <b>cones.</b> The divergent parts for the entanglement entropy of <b>hollow</b> <b>cones</b> are calculated.

40|$|Northern Jovian hectometric (HOM) radio emissions, {{detected}} {{from high}} Jovian latitudes by the Unified Radio and Plasma Wave experiment on the Ulysses spacecraft, were observed at all Jovian longitudes. This emission was observed to be predominantly right-hand circularly polarized, but some {{left-hand circular polarization}} was observed implying the presence of O mode emissions from the northern Jovian hemisphere. Intense HOM emissions, with well-defined directions and polarizations, were often confined to similar longitudinal regions where intense HOM emissions were previously observed at low latitudes. The present analysis confirms that these northern HOM sources lie in the Jovian polar regions on magnetic field lines that pass through the Io plasma torus. The observations may be consistent with emission from either a filled cone beam or a longitudinal distribution of thin <b>hollow</b> <b>cones...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The small {{dispersion}} in {{the observed}} relation between period and intrinsic opening angles of the conal emission regions in pulsars {{can be used}} to study their geometry. Applying this direct method shows the corresponding <b>hollow</b> <b>cones</b> to be consistent with being circular; an upper limit of approximately 10 % is derived for the deviation from a circular geometry. Previous investigations have relied on assumptions regarding the statistical properties of the pulsar sample used in the analysis. The disparate conclusions reached in the past concerning the geometry of pulsar beams is traced to the sensitivity of such indirect methods to the validity of these assumptions. It is further argued that there is no observational evidence for an evolution with pulsar age of the angle between the cone axis and rotation axis. Key words: pulsars: general 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A new {{picture of}} pulsar high-energy {{emission}} is proposed {{that is different}} from both the traditional polar cap and outer gap models, but combines elements of each. The slot gap model is based on electron acceleration {{along the edge of the}} open field region from the neutron star surface to near the light cylinder and thus could form a physical basis for the two-pole caustic model of (Dyks & Rudak, 2003). Along the last open field line, the pair formation front rises to very high altitude forming a slot gap, where the accelerating electric field is unscreened by pairs. The resulting radiation features both <b>hollow</b> <b>cones</b> from the lower-altitude pair cascades, seen at small viewing angles, as well as caustic emission on the trailing-edge field lines at high altitude, seen from both poles at large viewing angle. The combination of the small solid angle of slot gap emission (≪ 1 sr) with a high probability of viewing the emission predicts that more gamma-ray pulsars could be detected at larger distances. In this picture, many of the positional coincidences of radio pulsars with unidentified EGRET sources become plausible as real associations, as the flux predicted by the slot gap model for many of the pulsars would provide the observed EGRET source flux. The expected probability of seeing radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsars in this model will also be discussed...|$|R
