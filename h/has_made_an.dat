There are no seismic or geophysical instruments on the mountain (the nearest are in Nikolski), and some eruptions are first observed by pilots flying over the volcano. A field {{study was conducted in}} late 2001, and an automatic system based on thermal anomalies was implemented following eruptive events in 2005.
