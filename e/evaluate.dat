If the policy does apply, its {{condition}} is <b>evaluated</b> (in case of an atomic policy) or its sub-policies are <b>evaluated</b> (in case of a composed policy) and the result is returned. For composed policies, the sub-policies are <b>evaluated</b> in the given order; as a consequence, the policy tree is <b>evaluated</b> depth-first. For now, we assume all sub-policies and expressions to be <b>evaluated</b> sequentially.|$|R

For example, in the expression , if the first argument <b>evaluates</b> to nonzero (true), the result of the entire expression cannot be anything else than true, so b (...) is not <b>evaluated.</b> Similarly, in the expression , if the first argument <b>evaluates</b> to zero (false), the result of the entire expression cannot be anything else than false, so b (...) is not <b>evaluated.</b>|$|R

Seven hundred and fifty two from SSA and 398 from NA. Four studies <b>evaluated</b> parts of BRCA 1 & 2 in 171 patients, 5 studies <b>evaluated</b> {{the whole of the}} BRCA 1 gene in 465 patients, 6 studies <b>evaluated</b> all the regions of both genes in 299, while 2 studies <b>evaluated</b> parts of BRCA 1 in 571 and 1 study <b>evaluated</b> part of BRCA 2 in 20 patients.|$|R

25|$|In {{spite of}} its {{formidable}} definition, the topological index is usually straightforward to <b>evaluate</b> explicitly. So this {{makes it possible to}} <b>evaluate</b> the analytical index. (The cokernel and kernel of an elliptic operator are in general extremely hard to <b>evaluate</b> individually; the index theorem shows that we can usually at least <b>evaluate</b> their difference.) Many important invariants of a manifold (such as the signature) can be given as the index of suitable differential operators, so the index theorem allows us to <b>evaluate</b> these invariants in terms of topological data.|$|E

The other half were sent to another computer across the room to <b>evaluate</b> computer#1’s performance.|$|E

The author starts from Hume who greatly influenced modern philosophy but omits detailed polemics with various subjective attitudes which refer to Hume. The author concentrates on the analysis of <b>evaluating</b> itself and {{on the character of}} assessments and judgements on values. He reveals that <b>evaluating</b> is a complex emotional-cognitive process focusing on objects and discovering values as features of those objects. When <b>evaluating</b> is correct then judgements passed according to it are true or false. <b>Evaluating</b> is not only expression of subjective pleasant or unpleasant states.
