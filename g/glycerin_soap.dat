50|$|<b>Glycerin</b> <b>soap</b> {{is made by}} melting and {{continuously}} heating soap {{that has}} been partially dissolved in a high percentage alcohol solution until the mixture reaches a clear, jelly-like consistency. The alcohol is added to a slow cooked hot-processed soap and then simmered with a sugar solution until the soap is clear or translucent, and then the simmered soap is chilled in a freezer. With home- and hand-made soaps that still contain glycerin left over from saponification, the grating, melting and cooking can proceed without the addition of anything into the mixture, though sugar or more glycerin is sometimes added. <b>Glycerin</b> <b>soap</b> can also be produced without remelting soap through directly cooking raw home-made soap.|$|E

40|$|Galaxolide is {{the most}} used {{fragrance}} since the early 1990 s, {{and it has been}} largely detected in environmental and biological matrices. This polycyclic musk is present in almost all of our daily products, so the risk of human exposure is substantial, as it had been proved by its detection in human tissues and fluids. Due to the lack of information about the concentrations found in consumer products, monitoring data is needed for exposure assessment purposes. Dermal contact, mostly by personal care products, seems to be the major route of human exposure to galaxolide, and, due to the immaturity of young children’s skin, exposure consequences can be worse in this population. The main objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate galaxolide levels in personal care products used by children of Oporto (Portugal), aged 0 – 5 years, and relate it with consumer habits. Consumer patterns were obtained through 250 questionnaires to caregivers of Oporto children.

5000|$|Some soapmakers prefer [...] "melt and pour" [...] {{because the}} process is simple and safe, {{allowing}} the soapmaker to concentrate more on the aesthetic aspects of soap making. Because it avoids the need to handle lye, a hazardous and very caustic chemical, it is a hobby even children can enjoy under adult supervision. Unlike cold-processed soap, which requires a period of [...] "curing" [...] to allow saponification to complete and excess water to evaporate, the [...] "melt and pour" [...] process is completed once the base has cooled and hardened. The meltable base is usually naturally rich in glycerine, a by-product of saponification which has humectant and emollient properties, whereas commercial soap bars have often had this component removed. As with the rebatching method, it {{can be considered a}} misnomer to refer to the melt and pour process as soap making. The process has much in common with candle making using meltable wax which, using a similar process, can be scented, dyed and shaped on a small or large scale of production. Adding value to a melt and pour soap base involves augmentation by colouring, scenting, shaping and wrapping the bars, but the general characteristics of the soap, such as transparency or opacity, lathering, pH, fat content and hardness, will be implicitly those of the manufactured base. Melt and pour does not give the soaper complete control over the ingredients; for example, over the choice of fat to use. Conventional cold process or hot process soaps do not melt readily once they have saponified; the exceptions are clear <b>glycerin</b> <b>soaps,</b> and white soap made from white coconut oil. Melt and pour bases are typically manufactured from these types of soap.|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of ice on wings and other control surfaces of airplanes {{is one of}} the oldest and most vexing problems that aircraft engineers and scientists continue to face. While no easy, comprehensive answers exist, the staff at NASAs Icing Research Tunnel (IRT) at the Glenn Research Center in Cleveland has done pioneering work to make flight safer for experimental, commercial, and military customers. The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) initiated government research on aircraft icing in the 1930 s at its Langley facility in Virginia. Icing research shifted to the NACA's Cleveland facility in the 1940 s. Initially there was little focus on icing at either location, as these facilities were more concerned with aerodynamics and engine development. With several high-profile fatal crashes of air mail carriers, however, the NACA soon realized the need for a leading research facility devoted to icing prevention and removal. The IRT began operation in 1944 and, despite renovations and periodic attempts to shut it down, has continued to function productively for almost 60 years. In part because icing has proved so problematic over time, IRT researchers have been unusually open-minded in experimenting with a wide variety of substances, devices, and techniques. Early icing prevention experiments involved grease, pumping hot engine exhaust onto the wings, <b>glycerin</b> <b>soap,</b> mechanical and inflatable "boots," and even corn syrup. The IRT staff also looked abroad for ideas and later tried a German and Soviet technique of electromagnetism, to no avail. More recently, European polymer fluids have been more promising. The IRT even periodically had "amateur nights" in which a dentist's coating for children's teeth proved unequal to the demands of super-cooled water droplets blown at 100 miles per hour. Despite many research dead-ends, IRT researchers have achieved great success over the years. They have developed important computer models, such as the LEWICE software, and made significant contributions to prevent ice buildup on turbine-powered commercial aircraft, helicopters, and military planes...|$|E

40|$|Public and Government {{concern about}} {{environmental}} pollution {{and the high}} price of petroleum products have forced the development of alternative fuels for automotive applications. Biodiesel is one of the alternative fuels which can be produced from vegetable oils (either pure or waste) or animal fats. Since biodiesel has properties similar to diesel, it can be substituted for the latter with little or no engine modification. Also, its use can reduce the engine emissions. In this study, biodiesel is produced from waste vegetable oil using Fuel Pod 2 ™ system. The chemical catalists used were methanol and Sodium hydroxide. The production process yielded 87 % biodiesel with the remaining being <b>glycerin</b> and <b>soap.</b> The biodiesel production cost was evaluated considering the chemical costs, running costs, waste oil collection costs, etc. The biodiesel price was found to be about 60 pence per litre which is nearly half of the petro-diesel price. A Ford Puma 2. 4 litre diesel engine was used to investigate the effects of petro-diesel/biodiesel blends on the performance and emissions of the diesel engine. Petro-diesel and biodiesel (B 100) fuels was tested in addition to three blends B 10 (10 % biodiesel and 90 % petro-diesel), B 15 and B 20. The engine load varied as 25, 50, 75, and 100 % full load. Also, the engine speed varied as 1500, 2200, 2600, 3000 and 3300 rpm. At these conditions, the engine torque, fuel consumption and emissions were measured. Accordingly, the performance parameters were evaluated such as engine power, specific fuel consumption and engine efficiency.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the current}} energy scene of fossil fuel, {{renewable}} energy sources such as biodiesel, bioethanol, biomethane, and biomass from wastes or hydrogen have become the subjects of great interest. These fuels contribute to the reduction of dependence on fossil fuels. In addition, energy sources such as these could partially replace the use of those fuels which are responsible for environmental pollution and may be scarce in the future. For these reasons they are known as “alternative fuels”. Vegetable oil cannot be directly used in the diesel engine for its high viscosity, high density, high flash point and lower calorific value. So {{it needs to be}} converted into biodiesel to make it consistent with fuel properties of diesel. Biodiesel production is a valuable process which needs a continued study and optimization process. The present study was intended to consider aspects related to the production of biodiesel from Neem oil and investigating its fuel properties. The seeds of Neem contain 30 - 40 % oil. This report deals with biodiesel obtained from Neem oil which are mono alkyl esters produced using ‘Transesterification’ process. The optimum conditions to achieve maximum yield of biodiesel were investigated at different temperatures and with different molar ratio of Neem oil and methanol. The most expected result including layer of <b>glycerin</b> and <b>soap</b> has been investigated at 3 : 1 molar ratio of methanol and Neem oil at 55 to 61 °C temperature ranges. It was apparent that the fuel properties of biodiesel including density, kinematic viscosity and calorific value lie within the standards biodiesel properties especially (ASTM 6751 - 02) recommended standard of kinematic viscosity lies between 1. 90 to 6. 0 centistokes.

40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis of surface and ultrastructural changes in stratum corneum (SC) with {{transepidermal water loss}} (TEWL) was conducted to develop {{a better understanding of}} the surfactant-induced damage to human skin. Treatments comprised a synthetic hnionic surfactant (A), a composition of <b>soap,</b> <b>glycerin,</b> and petrolaturn (B), a pure soap (C), and water (control). An increase in water loss is shown to correlate with increased perturbation of lipid barrier and damage to multiple layers of corneocytes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that, in general, one to two layers of lipid lamellae enveloped the outer layers of SC throughout he tissue. A significantly larger number of lamellae (approximately six to eight) appeared only in the lower layers. Surface topology, obtained using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), displayed a normal unperturbed structure. Treatment with A did not result in significant changes in SC. B caused regional variations in corneocytes and an increase in TEWL. Treatment with C exhibited significant variation in TEWL numbers: lipid lamellae were disordered and corneocytes appeared damaged and swollen. Intercorneocyte damage ranged from one to two (for TEWL- 11 g/m 2 hr) to up to six cell layers (for TEWL- 34 g/m 2 hr) of the SC.
