3000|$|Before {{getting to}} the details of our {{relaying}} with channel borrowing, we will take a small step back to list some of the different concepts related to relaying and rate diversity that have been proposed to enhance throughput in 802.11 -type networks. One of the first ideas was to leverage multihopping for spatial reuse. In a wireless network, using multiple short hops can increase the number of simultaneous transmissions if combined with power control (note that this work assumed that all nodes have a fixed data rate, so it does not exploit rate diversity) [5]. However, it was also observed that if most traffic goes to and from an access point, spatial reuse alone does not lead to an increase in network throughput [5]. The reason is that the access point remains the bottleneck, and each path is basically contending for the same resources, much the same way direct transmissions would. The <b>first</b> <b>main</b> <b>point</b> to realize is that infrastructure networks thus behave fundamentally differently than mesh networks: the access point is the true bottleneck and spatial reuse by itself does not alleviate this problem!

5000|$|Celsus’ <b>first</b> <b>main</b> <b>point</b> in his True Word was {{to refute}} the {{validity}} of Christianity. In his opinion Christian theology {{was based on an}} amalgamation of false eastern philosophical ideas hastily tied together. He stated that Christians would “weave together erroneous opinions drawn from ancient sources and trumpet them aloud”.Celsus gave a point by point critique of Christian doctrine, and why it should not have been believed by anyone. He denied the virgin birth of Jesus, and accused Mary of being an adulteress turned out by her husband. His theory was not new, as even Jews at that time were saying the same. The remainder of Christian stories - what now makes up the Christian Bible- Celsus found very insipid and unappealing compared to Greek and Roman legends of powerful and colorful gods. Celsus also found Christian philosophy lacking when compared to secular philosophy, and declared that “things are stated much better among the Greeks”. [...] Celsus used Plato as the representative for Greek philosophers and, according to him, when comparing the two philosophical traditions Christianity appeared far worse, as [...] "Plato is not guilty of boasting and falsehood", a crime which Celsus obviously feels is a trademark of Christian theologians. The only connection Celsus made between Greek philosophy and Christianity was when he asserted that “Jesus perverted the words of the philosopher” (i.e. Plato).|$|R

40|$|As {{there are}} no {{scientific}} insights concerning sheet metal forming by hammering using an industrial robot, the main objective of this research work is to develop such a process and to gain a scientific basis for this forming method. By providing all technical components such as equipment and software, its technical practicability is proven. Chapter 2 systematically describes {{the state of the}} art of conventional and incremental sheet metal forming processes. In chapter 3 today's sheet metal production is analyzed based on published literature. In chapter 4, the concept of the system and the process cycle are presented. In addition, several alternatives of sub-systems and systems, which combine the hammering forming process with other forming, cutting and joining methods, are shown. Chapter 5 describes the realization of the first test facility for the hammering forming process according to the selected variants of the sub-systems. A first fundamental research is described in compliance with the <b>first</b> <b>main</b> <b>point</b> of examination defined in chapter 3. The acquired scientific knowledge was applied to increase the application area of the hammering forming process by deriving new forming strategies for the product of sheet metal parts with more complex geometries and improved geometrical accuracy. In chapter 6 a one-dimensional mechanical model of the robot cell for hammering sheet metal forming is presented based on well-chosen assumptions and simplifications. After the derivation and verification of the mechanical model, the model is used for a theoretical examination of vibrations to formulate qualitative and quantitative statements concerning the dimensioning of the hammering tool and the industrial robot. In chapter 7 a prototypical pilot installation is presented, consisting of the sub-systems for fixing and supporting the sheet metal, the hammering tool and the software for path generation. The combined sub-systems for fixing and supporting the sheet metal and the hammering tool are realized in accordance with the solution variants in chapter 4. The pilot installation is used for testing the hammering sheet metal forming process and the developed components by producing several demonstration sheet metal parts and one sheet metal prototype for the automobile industry...|$|R
