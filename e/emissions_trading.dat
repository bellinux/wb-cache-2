5|$|An <b>emissions</b> <b>trading</b> {{scheme for}} {{greenhouse}} gas emissions (GHGs) works by establishing property rights for the atmosphere. The atmosphere is a global public good, and GHG emissions are an international externality (p.21). The emissions from all sources of GHGs contribute to the overall stock of GHGs in the atmosphere. In the cap-and-trade variant of <b>emissions</b> <b>trading,</b> a limit on access to a resource (the cap) is defined and then allocated among users {{in the form of}} permits.

40|$|How to {{implement}} <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> is one {{question in the}} current negotiations on a new sulfur protocol in Europe. Whereas the current protocol stipulates a 30 percent uniform reduction, national emission ceilings included in the proposed new protocol imply differentiated reductions. In addition, emission and fuel standards are proposed. This paper examines the costs and environmental impacts of <b>emission</b> <b>trading.</b> <b>Emission</b> <b>trading</b> combined with regulations is a new element in the paper. Calculations using the RAINS (Regional Acidification INformation and Simulation) model suggest that overlaying <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> on regulations not only reduces the cost savings but has beneficial impacts as well: ecosystem protection is not changed and significant decreases in environmental benefits for countries are largely avoided. <b>Emission</b> <b>trading</b> {{can also be used}} to decrease emissions and increase ecosystem protection. If combined with existing legislation, <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> minimizes losses in expected environmental benefits for some countries, and most countries gain. However, the initial distribution of emission ceilings has to be used so that some countries are not confronted with higher costs. Trade-offs appear to exist between the use of <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> to achieve cost savings on the one hand, and ecosystem protection and distributional equity on the other.

40|$|Abstract: Over {{the past}} 10 years, the Chinese State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) has {{actively}} investigated the potent to use <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> to reduce sulphur dioxide (SO 2) emissions from electricity generators and industrial sources. In 1999, SEPA partnered with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (U. S. EPA) to cooperate {{on a study}} to assess the feasibility of implementing SO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> in China. SEPA has also pursued <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> pilot projects in several cities and provinces. The authors, using information from the feasibility study and pilot projects, introduce the circumstances necessary for SO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> in China, outline the experience to date, and analyse implementation opportunities and barriers in China. The contents of the paper are: (1) SO 2 emission control policies in China; (2) institutional requirements and the basis for introducing SO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> in China; (3) case studies of <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> in China; (4) opportunities and barriers to implementing <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> in China; (5) recommendations to transition from pilot projects to a nationwide SO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> program; and (6) conclusions and suggestions. Key words: sulphur dioxide, <b>emission</b> <b>trading,</b> market-based instrument, China 1. BACKGROUND Acid rain and sulphur dioxide (SO 2) pollution in China are very severe – ambient concentrations in some regions are several times higher than air quality standards – and have significant impacts on human health, ecosystems, and cultural resources. The toll on {{human health and the}} economy from air pollution is estimated to cost as much as 2 % of GDP annually (Xie, 1998). As a result, since 1995 the Chinese government has placed great importance on controlling acid rain and SO 2 pollution. In order to accomplish this, the government has identified key geographic areas where the problem is particularly severe and adopted a series of policies and measures to abate SO 2 <b>emissions.</b> <b>Emission</b> <b>trading</b> is one of the instruments the government is investigating. This paper analyses the opportunities and barriers to implementing SO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> in China considering current institutional and legal conditions...|$|R

40|$|<b>Emission</b> <b>trading</b> {{policies}} are increasingly important in environmental protection, especially in controlling {{air pollution in}} the United States.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{illuminate}} potential problems with the flexibility mechanism in the Kyoto Protocol connected to the establishment of an enforcement system. The Kyoto mechanisms are <b>emission</b> <b>trading,</b> Joint Implementation with other Annex B countries and finally the Clean Development Mechanism. With regard to <b>emission</b> <b>trading,</b> we discuss new challenges for monitoring, reporting and verification, the issue of supplementarity, intertemporal <b>emission</b> <b>trading,</b> the “hot-air” problem and liability issues. The Joint Implementation mechanism is a credit trading mechanism within an already established <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> regime. The additional problems for Joint Implementation projects under the Kyoto Protocol compared to <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> would mainly be higher transaction costs obtained from bargaining between two parties. Increased costs through an enforcement system would not necessarily occur here. The Clean Development Mechanism on the other hand is a credit trading mechanism outside an <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> system and here several new problems arise. We discuss the problem of additionality and leakages. Finally, we discuss the enforcement of non-compliance under the Protocol. We conclude by discussing the possible incentives for cheating and undermining the intentions of the Protocol that are revealed by the problems with the flexibility mechanisms discussed in the pape...|$|R

40|$|China’s air {{pollution}} {{has become a}} major environmental concern for the Chinese government and the Chinese public. Although China has established a comprehensive legal framework for environmental protection, many obstacles impede the enforcement of environmental laws and regulations. In light of the Chinese government’s vigorous use of <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> as a primary means of addressing the environmental problems in recent years, this paper identifies and explains the major economic, legal, political, social, and cultural impediments to enforcing the environmental regulation of China. The paper then engages in a comparative analysis of the <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> programs of the United States and China, focusing on their different features and varied performance levels in terms of participation and compliance enforcement. The analysis reveals that China’s pollution <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> programs are simply hybrids of traditional command-and-control and modern market-based approaches to environmental regulation – approaches that have been unable to help resolve long-standing enforcement problems. Nevertheless, such empirical findings do not lead to the conclusion that China should give up <b>emission</b> <b>trading.</b> The study shows that <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> possesses advantageous features that can help relieve the economic, political, legal, social, and cultural impediments to enforcement faced by China.

5|$|The {{government}} recognises {{that there}} are no viable alternative aviation fuels, and whilst it accepts that the exemption of aviation fuel from fuel tax is anomalous, it sees no scope for a unilateral approach in addressing this. The strategy adopted in the White Paper seeks to mitigate the global impact of air transport primarily through <b>emissions</b> <b>trading</b> schemes. Although the Kyoto Protocol implemented <b>emissions</b> <b>trading</b> as a means to reduce emissions at national levels, the global nature of air transport means that all air travel is excluded from this mechanism. The government is seeking to redress this through the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), which has been working on the environmental issue since 1998, but progress is slow. In the meantime efforts are being made to include aviation in the EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) with an original target to implement this by 2008. In 2006 the government re-affirmed this policy as the best approach for addressing the climate change impacts of aviation, and current proposals aim at accomplishing this for all flights within the EU by 2011, with the scheme being extended to include all flights to and from the EU the following year.|$|E
