25|$|The postwar {{summer of}} 1919 {{had already been}} marked by deadly race riots <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> dozen cities across the country, {{including}} Chicago, Knoxville, Washington, DC, and Omaha, Nebraska. Competition for jobs and housing in crowded markets following World War I as veterans returned to society resulted in outbreaks of racial violence, usually of ethnic whites against blacks. Having served their country in the Great War, African-American veterans resisted racial discrimination and violence. In 1919 blacks vigorously fought back when their communities were attacked. Labor unrest and strikes took place in several cities as workers tried to organize. As industries hired blacks as strikebreakers in some cities, worker resentment against them increased.|$|E

25|$|After {{finishing}} elementary school, {{students are}} obliged to take one year in high school. They are able to pick from Gymnasium, which {{is seen as the}} highest level of high-school education and usually considered as a preparatory school for attending a university, although anyone can apply to any university. Besides Gymnasiums, Slovakia has specialised high schools with bacalaureat and specialised highschools without bacalaureat. Schools with bacalaureat take 5 years to complete while the ones without usually take less. Gymnasiums and many other high schools require passing an entry exam, consider previous study results or perform a combination of both before accepting a new student. A student may apply to two high schools at once. If student fails to get accepted in any high school, the student can submit an appeal or seek a third high school with an empty slot for one more student outside of the standard application process. Parents and students prefer to avoid this uncertainty and tend to choose at least one high school with a high chance of acceptance. Most high-schools are finished by passing a matura exam, which consists of Slovak language and literature, one foreign language and one specialised subject. If school offered multiple specializations or taught multiple foreign languages, student may choose which subject he or she wants to do the matura exam in. If student wants and the school allows it, it's possible to do matura exam <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> subjects.|$|E

500|$|After twelve rehearsals, the {{orchestra}} {{made its debut}} at the Queen's Hall on 7 October 1932, conducted by Beecham. [...] After the first item, Berlioz's Roman Carnival Overture, the audience went wild, some of them standing on their seats to clap and shout. In The Sunday Times Ernest Newman wrote, [...] "Nothing so electrifying has been heard in a London concert room for years. The tone was magnificent, the precision perfect, the reading a miracle of fire and beauty, and the enthusiasm of the audience {{could not have been}} greater." [...] In The Times H C Colles said that the LPO was [...] "as fine an instrument as could be wished for"; Neville Cardus wrote in The Manchester Guardian, [...] "nothing more sumptuous and daring in orchestral playing could be heard <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> other cities between New York and Vienna"; and W J Turner, of The Illustrated London News, praised {{the orchestra}}'s [...] "youthful dash and virtuosity... at last we have an independent orchestra which rivals the BBC Symphony Orchestra".|$|E
500|$|Views of Elgar's stature {{have varied}} {{in the decades}} since his music came to {{prominence}} {{at the beginning of}} the twentieth century. Richard Strauss, as noted, hailed Elgar as a progressive composer; even the hostile reviewer in The Observer, unimpressed by the thematic material of the First Symphony in 1908, called the orchestration [...] "magnificently modern". Hans Richter rated Elgar as [...] "the greatest modern composer" [...] in any country, and Richter's colleague Arthur Nikisch considered the First Symphony [...] "a masterpiece of the first order" [...] to be [...] "justly ranked with the great symphonic models – Beethoven and Brahms." [...] By contrast, the critic W. J. Turner, in the mid-twentieth century, wrote of Elgar's [...] "Salvation Army symphonies," [...] and Herbert von Karajan called the Enigma Variations [...] "second-hand Brahms". Elgar's immense popularity was not long-lived. After the success of his First Symphony and Violin Concerto, his Second Symphony and Cello Concerto were politely received but without the earlier wild enthusiasm. His music was identified in the public mind with the Edwardian era, and after the First World War he no longer seemed a progressive or modern composer. In the early 1920s, even the First Symphony had only one London performance <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> years. Henry Wood and younger conductors such as Boult, Sargent and Barbirolli championed Elgar's music, but in the recording catalogues and the concert programmes of the middle of the century his works were not well represented.|$|E
