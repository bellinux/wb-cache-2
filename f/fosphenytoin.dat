50|$|The only {{currently}} available method to diagnose Unverricht-Lundborg {{disease is a}} genetic test to check {{for the presence of}} the mutated cystatin B gene.

Twenty-four adult New Zealand White rabbits (2. 1 +/- 0. 4 kg) were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone (30 mg/kg) followed by i. v or i. m administration of a single 10 mg/kg phenytoin sodium or <b>fosphenytoin</b> sodium equivalents. Blood samples (1. 5 ml) were obtained from a femoral artery cannula predose and at 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240 and 300 min after drug administration.

Following i. v administration of <b>fosphenytoin</b> sodium plasma phenytoin concentrations were similar to those obtained following i. v administration of an equivalent dose of phenytoin sodium.

40|$|Andrew ThomsonCore Medical Publishing, Knutsford, UKIntroduction: Status epilepticus (SE) is a {{life-threatening}} condition requiring prompt {{treatment in the}} emergency department to control seizures and limit potential neurologic damage. <b>Fosphenytoin</b> is a water-soluble prodrug of phenytoin (an established treatment option for SE) that has been developed to overcome the often severe venous adverse events that can occur following the intravenous administration of phenytoin. Aims: The objective {{of this article is}} to review the evidence for the use of <b>fosphenytoin</b> in the treatment of SE. Evidence review: <b>Fosphenytoin</b> can be infused more rapidly than phenytoin and there is evidence that therapeutic drug levels are achieved at least at a similar rate. Although few studies have been conducted in SE patients, there is evidence that <b>fosphenytoin</b> is at least as effective as phenytoin in terms of response and control of SE. There is also moderate evidence that there are fewer vascular adverse events following intravenous <b>fosphenytoin</b> compared with phenytoin administration when both drugs are infused at the recommended dosage and rate. Evidence from pharmacoeconomic studies indicates that a reduction in the incidence of adverse events and their subsequent management are critical factors for cost-effectiveness with <b>fosphenytoin.</b> Clinical value: In conclusion, <b>fosphenytoin</b> is a valuable treatment option for the rapid treatment of SE; the risk of venous adverse events is lower than with phenytoin when administered at the recommended rate.

We studied the pharmacokinetics and clinical effects of phenytoin and <b>fosphenytoin</b> sodium in children with severe falciparum malaria and status epilepticus. Methods Children received intravenous (i. v.) phenytoin as a 18 mg kg(- 1) loading dose infused over 20 min followed by a 2. 5 mg kg(- 1) 12 hourly maintenance dose infused over 5 min (n = 11), or i. v. <b>fosphenytoin,</b> administered at a rate of 50 mg min(- 1) phenytoin sodium equivalents (PE; n = 16), or intramuscular (i. m.) <b>fosphenytoin</b> as a 18 mg kg(- 1) loading dose followed by 2. 5 mg kg(- 1) 12 hourly of PE (n = 11). Concentrations of phenytoin in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), frequency of seizures, cardiovascular effects (respiratory rate, blood pressure, trancutaneous oxygen tension and level of consciousness) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) blood flow velocity were monitored. Results After all routes of administration, a plasma unbound phenytoin concentration of more than 1 mug ml(- 1) was rapidly (within 5 - 20 min) attained. Mean (95 % confidence interval) steady state free phenytoin concentrations were 2. 1 (1. 7, 2. 4; i. v. phenytoin, n = 6), 1. 5 (0. 96, 2. 1; i. v. <b>fosphenytoin,</b> n = 11) and 1. 4 (0. 5, 2. 4; i. m. <b>fosphenytoin,</b> n = 6), and were not statistically different for the three routes of administration. Median times (range) to peak plasma phenytoin concentrations following the loading dose were 0. 08 (0. 08 - 0. 17), 0. 37 (0. 33 - 0. 67) and 0. 38 (0. 17 - 2. 0) h for i. v. <b>fosphenytoin,</b> i. v. phenytoin and i. m. <b>fosphenytoin,</b> respectively. CSF: plasma phenytoin concentration ratio ranged from 0. 12 to 0. 53 (median = 0. 28, n = 16).

METHODS: Multiple intravenous (i. v.) doses of chloramphenicol succinate (CAP) (25 mg kg- 1 6 hourly for 72 h) and a single intramuscular (i. m.) seizure prophylactic dose of <b>fosphenytoin</b> (18 mg kg- 1 phenytoin sodium equivalents) were concomitantly administered to 15 African children with malaria. Control children (n = 13) with malaria received a similar dose of <b>fosphenytoin</b> and multiple i. v. doses (25 mg kg- 1 8 hourly for 72 h) of cefotaxime (CEF). Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, level of consciousness and convulsion episodes were monitored.

She had right hemiparesis and later developed right facial twitching that did not respond to intravenous <b>fosphenytoin</b> and levetiracetam. She was transferred for further management. Upon arrival, lorazepam and <b>fosphenytoin</b> were given and right face clonic movements resolved. However, continuous EEG monitoring revealed ongoing non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). Following treatment with IV valproate and lacosamide, there was resolution of NCSE. SESA is likely an under recognized clinical syndrome that is quite distinct from typical alcohol withdrawal seizures and requires a different diagnostic and management approach. NCSE is likely to account for the encephalopathy and focal neurological deficits seen in patients presenting with the clinical syndrome of SESA. Therefore, a high degree of suspicion is warranted and continuous EEG monitoring is recommended for alcoholic patients with encephalopathy and focal neurological deficits...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{repetitive}} seizures, {{more commonly}} known as cluster, crescendo or sequential seizures, are defined as episodes of increased seizure activity occurring in patients with refractory epilepsy who are already receiving stable regimens of anticonvulsants. They lie in the seizure spectrum between isolated seizures and status epilepticus. If acute repetitive seizures are left untreated, they may progress to status epilepticus. Acute repetitive seizures and prolonged seizures are rated as a neurological emergency and treatment must be prompt. The primary goals of therapy are cessation of the seizure and prevention of recurrence. The use of traditional intravenous agents such as phenytoin, phenobarbital (phenobarbitone), lorazepam and diazepam is well established in the first-line treatment of acute seizures. However, adverse effects and the time to onset of effect often dictate the choice between older anticonvulsants. Newer agents (such as <b>fosphenytoin)</b> and alternative routes of administration (such as rectal administration of diazepam solution) have been developed {{in an effort to}} reduce adverse effects, decrease the time to onset of effect, reduce acute care facility costs and investigate the possibility of home treatment. Diazepam rectal gel, a newer formulation of diazepam intended for rectal administration, effectively terminates acute seizures and prevents recurrence within the first 12 hours after administration. Diazepam rectal gel is available for use by a trained caregiver in a home setting and, therefore, emergency room treatment and hospitalisation may not be required and could be avoided. This may result in reductions in financial and emotional costs associated with acute repetitive seizures, but broader clinical experience is needed to assess this. Diazepam rectal gel is not associated with respiratory depression and most adverse effects appear to be mild to moderate in severity. At present, diazepam rectal gel is a valuable addition to the current anticonvulsant armamentarium for first-line therapy of acute repetitive seizures. Wider clinical experience will better determine the place of this formulation in the treatment of this debilitating disorder.

40|$|Tiagabine is an {{antiepileptic}} drug used as adjunctive {{therapy for}} partial seizures that {{is believed to}} selectively inhibit the presynaptic reuptake of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). We describe {{a case of a}} tiagabine overdose that resulted in status epilepticus (SE) in a patient with no seizure history. A 14 -year-old girl with a history of asthma presented with convulsive SE after ingestion of an unknown amount of her sister’s tiagabine in a suicide attempt. Attempted anticonvulsant therapy included a total of diazepam 10 mg IV, lorazepam 6 mg IV, pyridoxine 5 g IV, and <b>fosphenytoin</b> 20 mg PE/kg. All were without effect. A computed tomography and electrocardiogram were normal. Con-tinuous bedside EEG monitoring showed suppression of seizure activity following intravenous midazolam. A tiagabine level ob-tained on ED arrival was 420 ng/mL (therapeutic 20 – 103 ng/mL). The patient was discharged to psychiatry within 1 week with no neurologic sequelae...|$|E
40|$|Seizures are {{a common}} cause of {{emergency}} department vis-its, andapproximately 28 %of epilepsypatients present to an emergency department annually for treatment. This article will {{provide an overview of}} the pharmacotherapeutic man-agement of seizures and anticonvulsant therapy for patients who present to the adult emergency department, including practical information for pharmacists covering or cross-covering this practice area. The benzodiazepines are re-viewed as a class, including dosing strategies, pharmaco-dynamic considerations, and advantages and disadvantages of lorazepam, diazepam, andmidazolam. Indications for the use of phenytoin and <b>fosphenytoin</b> will be reviewed, as well as dosing, adverse effects, and cost-effectiveness data. In ad-dition, dosing, administration, pharmacokinetics, and ad-verse effects of phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and valproate will be discussed. Clinical indications for serum anticonvulsant concentration monitoring and subsequent calculation of loading doses from serum concentrations are reviewed. Since status epilepticus is a life-threatening emer-gency, its therapeuticmanagement is reviewed, including the use of continuous infusion midazolam, pentobarbital, and propofol. There are many opportunities for clinical pharma-cists to collaborate {{with other members of the}} health care team to optimize efficacy and minimize adverse effects of anticonvulsant agents in the emergency department setting...|$|E
