5000|$|The {{earliest}} breech-lock Canon FD lenses (1970-1973) {{are generally}} recognizable by a chrome (silver) <b>filter</b> <b>ring</b> {{at the front}} (this ring includes its own bayonet used to mount an appropriate lens hood).

In the 'chrome nose' series, only the large-aperture 55mm f/1.2,and 55mm F1.2 AL (Aspherical) and the 7.5mm Fish-Eye lenses used S.S.C. coating. This first series of FD lenses shared other characteristics that would later change; the breech-lock ring can be rotated freely without mounting it on a camera body, and the aperture ring had a green [...] "o" [...] at the end of the scale to indicate automatic aperture operation, which at the time was only possible with an F-1 body that had the Servo EE Finder attached. The aperture ring could be rotated freely on and off of [...] "o", although the small AE switch pin in the back of the lens (which came out when the aperture ring was rotated to [...] "o" [...] prevented one from doing this unless the body has the appropriate small hole in the proper location. There are chrome nose first generation FD lenses without chrome front barrels, Several wide angle lenses and some telephoto lenses have black barrels, but their date code, lack of an aperture lock button and freely rotating breech ring place them into the first version FD lens group.|$|E

Cascaded microring resonators {{have been used to}} realize refractive index sensors with high sensitivity in the intensity detection mode.

A significant drawback of this configuration is decreased range of detection. We overcome this problem by thermo-optically tuning the spectrum the <b>filter</b> <b>ring</b> to track the position of maximum overlap, as the spectrum of the probing ring undergoes shift.

40|$|Spin Filtering is {{the only}} {{experimentally}} demonstrated method {{which could lead to}} an intense beam of polarized antiprotons. The physics of spin filtering defines certain requirements to the storage ring, which have {{to be taken into account}} in the design of a dedicated spin <b>filter</b> <b>ring.</b> Spin filtering makes use of the repetitive interaction of circulating unpolarized particles with a polarized target in a storage cell. The polarization build up process for an antiproton beam is expected to be most effective around energies of 50 up to a few hundred MeV. The process makes use of the different scattering cross sections of particles with different polarization states, leading to different loss probabilities in the storage ring. In order to achieve a significantly high degree of polarization of the circulating ion beam with a reasonable intensity, the storage ring has to provide a long beam lifetime at a target thickness of a polarized target as high as possible. Depolarizing resonances have to be avoided to reach a long polarization lifetime...|$|E
40|$|We have {{isolated}} {{a complement}} of gene homologs from the simplest extant eukaryotic species to possess voltage-gated sodium (Na+) and calcium (Ca 2 +) channels, Salpingoeca rosetta. The isolated channels {{share the same}} 4 Domain, 6 Transmembrane helices (4 x 6 TM) architecture characteristic of voltage-gated ion channels and do not exhibit any alternative splicing. Transfection and expression of both channels in Human Embryonic Kidney- 293 T (HEK- 293 T) cells generate voltage-dependent ionic currents. SroNav 2 codes for an 1831 amino-acid transmembrane protein of four repeat domains with a selectivity <b>filter</b> <b>ring,</b> DEEA, resembling Ca 2 +-selective sodium channel genes found exclusively in non-vertebrate animals. The structurally similar to Nav 1, SroNav 2 shows non-selective ion permeability and allows the passage of both divalent and monovalent ions. The SroNav 2 selectivity filter mutant, DEKA, produced to mimic neuronal vertebrate Nav 1 channels, produces a highly selective channel that exclusively passes monovalent ions. SroCav 1 codes for a 1664 amino-acid transmembrane protein, requires co-expression of a native β auxiliary subunit, and is highly selective and does not allow the passage of sodium. SroCav 1 lacks obvious calcium-dependent inactivation and does not exhibit the same long-lasting currents characteristic of L-type channels with Ba 2 + as a charge carrier. We envisage that these homologs of voltage-gated Ca 2 + and Na+ channels found in single cell choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta may generate Ca 2 +-dependent action potentials that signal between cells of choanoflagellate colonies, regulate intra-cellular events, or control movement of it’s single flagellum or cilia...|$|E

40|$|The MOS 6581, more {{commonly}} known as the Sound Interface Device, or ‘SID chip’ was the sonic heart of 1982 ’s Commodore 64 home computer. By considering its development, specification, use and abuse by composers, alongside its continuing legacy, this paper argues that, more than any other device, the SID chip is responsible for shaping the sound of videogame music. The importance of the SID chip is partly a consequence of Bob Yannes’ chip design (Bagnall 2011). Compared with the brutal atonality of chips such as the Atari VCS’ TIA (Montfort and Bogost 2009), SID offers a remarkably complex 3 -channel synthesiser with dynamic waveform selection, per-channel ADSR envelopes, a multimode <b>filter,</b> <b>ring</b> and cross modulation. However, the limitations and flaws of the chip are just as significant and the compositional, sound design and programming techniques developed by 1980 s composer/coders like Rob Hubbard and Martin Galway are central in defining the distinctive sound of C 64 gameplay [...] While noting a specific approach to looping that distinguishes many C 64 compositions from those created for the Nintendo Entertainment System (see Collins 2008; Schartmann 2015), the argument here centres on the inexorable link between the technical and the musical. Hubbard et al. developed their own bespoke low-level drivers to interface with the SID chip in order to create pseudo-polyphony through rapid arpeggiation, Pulse Width Modulation, ringmod, drum synthesis, portamento, and even sample playback. In this work we note the indivisibility of sound design, synthesis and composition in the birth of the forms and aesthetics that would go on to be defined as ‘chiptunes’...|$|E
40|$|AbstractInactivation is a {{fundamental}} property of voltage-gated ion channels. Fast inactivation of Na+ channels involves channel block by the III–IV cytoplasmic interdomain linker. The mechanisms of nonfast types of inactivation (intermediate, slow, and ultraslow) are unclear, although the ionic environment and P-loops rearrangement appear to be involved. In this study, we employed a TTX-based P-loop domain model of a sodium channel and the MCM method to investigate a possible role of P-loop rearrangement in the nonfast inactivation. Our modeling predicts that Na+ ions can bind between neighboring domains in the outer-carboxylates ring EEDD, forming an ordered structure with interdomain contacts that stabilize the conducting conformation of the outer pore. In this model, the permeant ions can transit between the EEDD ring and the selectivity <b>filter</b> <b>ring</b> DEKA, retaining contacts {{with at least two}} carboxylates. In the absence of Na+, the electrostatic repulsion between the EEDD carboxylates disrupts the permeable configuration. In this Na+-deficient model, the region between the EEDD and DEKA rings is inaccessible for Na+ but is accessible for TMA. Taken together, these results suggest that Na+-saturated models are consistent with experimental characteristics of the open channels, whereas Na+-deficient models are consistent with experimentally defined properties of the slow-inactivated channels. Our calculations further predict that binding of LAs to the inner pore would depend on whether Na+ occupies the DEKA ring. In the absence of Na+ in the DEKA ring, the cationic group of lidocaine occurs in the focus of the pore helices’ macrodipoles and would prevent occupation of the ring by Na+. Loading the DEKA ring with Na+ results in the electrostatic repulsion with lidocaine. Thus, there are antagonistic relations between a cationic ligand bound in the inner pore and Na+ in the DEKA ring...|$|E
