The incidence of facial and udder lesions generally is increased when teeth are left intact. However, {{there is no evidence that}} these lesions affect piglet mortality or weaning weight. Thus, based on the conditions of these experiments, there is no strong justification for teeth clipping. Many producers have abandoned teeth clipping. Besides saving labor, they report having fewer poor doing piglets and joint infections that can result from teeth clipping. Some producers have tried to stop clipping, but because of <b>greasy</b> <b>pig</b> <b>disease</b> problems they have resumed.

40|$|Effectiveness {{could be}} {{inspected}} by conduction of clinical trials, by reviewing in vitro susceptibility of bacteria and by performing meta-analysis or systematic review. Through meta-analysis, {{the researchers are}} able to integrate results and findings from different studies. This analytical method is of particular importance {{in the assessment of}} therapeutic efficacy when individual studies do not provide an overview over all studies on a topic. As their samples are too small, individual studies cannot provide a quantitative evaluation of the effect of treatment, nor can they test null hypothesis. Prior to meta-analysis, the traditional method was a narrative discourse on previous findings, which, however, could be misleading and subjective. Systematic reviews are exact summaries of the best evidences related to exactly specified clinical dilemmas. These reviews support the synthesis of best evidence for treatment or establishment of best medical practice. We reviewed and evaluated the efficacy of the treatment of various infections with enrofloxacin for individual animal species. A special meta-analysis was carried out and graphically presented for the treatment of each disease (forrest plots). In most cases, we chose the odds ratio to present the effect size. By following a systematic way of reviewing, we ensured repeatability of our meta-analyses in case this would be done by other investigators. In heterogeneous meta-analyses, we calculated the total size of the effect according to a random calculation model for total effect size. Additionally the homogeneity of studies was graphically evaluated with funnel plots. In addition to clinical studies, we reviewed and combined data on bacterial in vitro susceptibility to enrofloxacin. These results were also considered in the final opinion about individual meta-analysis of efficacy of enrofloxacin. Individual studies were collected by reviewing databases available on CD ROMs or Online. We also reviewed references in different published studies and databases on the internet. We obtained 919 articles for the studies for the first selection, for a closer review, we chose 237 healthcare studiesČ 110 in pigs, 67 in ruminants and 60 in poultry. In 19 meta-analyses, we reviewed and evaluated efficacy of enrofloxacin usage and bacterial in vitro susceptibilityto enrofloxacin, while in 7 cases we also calculated the individual effect size (odds ratio) for a specific parameter. The results demonstrate efficacy of enrofloxacin treatment of respiratory infections in all above mentioned domestic animals (P< 0. 01). Enrofloxacin is very effective in treatment of coli and salmonella infections in pigs and poultry (P< 0. 001) and effective in treatment of mycoplasma infections, with additional studies of colibacillosis, salmonellosis and mycoplasma infections being necessary in cattle. Meta-analysis in poultry showed efficacy of enrofloxacin treatment in infectious coryza, staphylococcosis, pasteurellosis in turkeys, and R. anatipestifer infection in ducks (P< 0. 001). In pigs, enrofloxacin treatment was significantly more effective in trial group than in control group for MMA syndrome, urinary tract infections and streptococcal infections (P< 0. 05). For Glässerćs disease, the difference, in comparison to control group, was not significant (P= 0. 25), however, the pathogen (H. parasuis, n = 124) was 100 % susceptible to enrofloxacin. In <b>greasy</b> <b>pig</b> <b>disease,</b> there is a high in vitro susceptibility of S. hyicus to enrofloxacin (98. 3 %, n = 744). Complex questions about cattle mastitis call for additional enrofloxacin studies, although in vitro results of mastitis pathogen susceptibility are good. Likewise, additional endometritis treatment studies in cattle are necessary, since the difference between trial and control group was not statistically significant (P= 0. 9), although the results were in favour of enrofloxacin treatment. We reviewed the available studies and could assess sufficiently andinsufficiently analysed parameters. Some studies revealed statistically significant results and some not. It occurred in some cases that studies that lacked significant results, due their weight, had a greater impact on the analysis than those with significant results. It was this part of our researchthat revealed one of the greatest difference between meta-analysis andthe narrative comparison of the literature. Our findings can be considered useful for investigators, doctors of veterinary medicine in practice and for the breeders, {{as well as for the}} manufacturers of veterinary medicines and governmental authorities. Our work offers an overall survey of the problem andprovides guidelines for further research of the topic...|$|E

40|$|Although Clostridium {{perfringens}} {{is recognized}} as an important cause of clostridial enteric diseases, only limited knowledge exists concerning the association of particular C. perfringens toxinotypes (type A to E) with gastrointestinal (GI) diseases in domestic animals. Some C. perfringens isolates also produce the newly discovered beta 2 -toxin (CPB 2). Recent epidemiological studies suggested that C. perfringens isolates carrying the gene encoding CPB 2 (cpb 2) are strongly associated with clostridial GI diseases in domestic animals, including necrotic enteritis in piglets and typhlocolitis in horses. These putative relationships, obtained by PCR genotyping, were tested {{in the present study}} by further genotyping and phenotyping of 29 cpb 2 -positive C. perfringens isolates from <b>pigs</b> with GI <b>disease</b> (<b>pig</b> GI <b>disease</b> isolates). PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis reconfirmed the presence of cpb 2 gene sequences in all the disease isolates included in the study.

Novobiocin was the most active compound tested, with an MIC for 90 % of the strains tested (MIC 90) of 32. 0 micrograms/ml. Initial testing with sulfadiazine-trimethoprim yielded an MIC 90 of > 64. 0 micrograms/ml, but subsequent testing with thymidine phosphorylase-supplemented medium yielded an MIC 90 of 0. 06 microgram/ml. Both lincomycin and spectinomycin were relatively inactive against the S. hyicus strains tested, with MIC 90 s of > 64. 0 and > 128. 0 micrograms/ml, respectively.

40|$|In Vietnam, {{there are}} more than 4 million {{households}} producing pigs and pork. This accounts for 57 % of quantity of meat consumed. One of the most critical constraints to pig production is the presence of animal <b>disease.</b> <b>Pig</b> <b>disease</b> outbreaks are a regular occurrence {{in various parts of the}} country, with the industry affected by diseases such as foot and mouth disease, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, classical swine fever, porcine high fever disease, and swine influenza. In addition, food safety issues related to <b>pig</b> <b>diseases</b> and pork-borne diseases have also increasingly become more important concerns for consumers. Recent studies have shown significant changes in consumption behaviour in response to disease outbreaks. For instance, at least half of urban consumers stop consuming pork in times of <b>pig</b> <b>disease</b> epidemics and/or shift consumption to other meat substitutes such as poultry or fish. Disease risks thus have both public health and livelihoods impacts that are important to understand for appropriate policy and practice response. A proposed methodology for investigating disease risks uses a system dynamics analysis framework. System dynamics models are particularly relevant in the study of livestock systems, as they capture the diverse actors and feedbacks present in value chains and their interface with disease risk and behaviour. A system dynamics model is developed that will describe different scenarios of disease risks and the consequences of different interventions to mitigate these risks. Data from a sample of 1000 farmers and value chain actors including all actors in the pig value chain in Vietnam was collected with support from an ACIAR-funded project on Reducing Disease Risks and Improving Food Safety in Smallholder Pig Value Chains in Vietnam.

The aim is to evaluate the significance of pathologic-anatomical examinations for early detection of <b>pig</b> <b>diseases</b> and to investigate {{the impact of the}} findings on the improvement of pig health. Pig producers can participate if {{at least one of the}} following criteria is fulfilled: high morbidity and/or high mortality, unusual clinical signs, recurrent problems of unknown aetiology resistant to therapy or increased use of antimicrobials. Accordingly, the veterinarian examines the herd, fills in a standardised anamnesis protocol and submits one to three pigs representing the health problem to a designated pathology laboratory. After post mortem examination, the veterinarian offers specific recommendations to the farmer. Three to six months later, the Swiss Pig Health Service (SPHS) follows up the success of the veterinary recommendations. In 2014, 371 farms submitted pigs for PathoPig. In 84 % of these cases, a conclusive diagnosis was obtained. In 56 % of the cases, gastrointestinal problems were determined, most often (44 %) caused by pathogenic Escherichia coli. In more than 80 % of the cases, the animal health status could be improved considerably after the veterinary consultation.

Regarding <b>pig</b> <b>diseases,</b> Limpopo province is important as the greater part of the province falls within the African swine fever control area. Emerging small-scale pig farmers in Limpopo perceived pig production as an important means of improving their livelihood and an alternative investment. They engage in trading and marketing their products with a potential risk to animal health, because the preferred markets often facilitate potential longdistance spread and disease dispersal over broad geographic areas. In this study, we explored the interconnectedness of smallholder pig farmers in Limpopo, determined the weaknesses and critical control points, and projected interventions that policy makers can implement to reduce the risks to pig health. The geo-coordinates of surveyed farms were used to draw maps, links and networks. Predictive risks to pigs were determined through the analyses of trade networks, and the relationship to previous outbreaks of African swine fever was postulated. Auction points were identified as high-risk areas for the spread of animal diseases. Veterinary authorities should prioritise focused surveillance and diagnostic efforts in Limpopo. Early disease detection and prompt eradication should be targeted and messages promoting enhanced biosecurity to smallholder farmers are advocated. The system may also benefit from the restructuring of marketing and auction networks.

Classical edema disease has not previously been described in Denmark, but between February 1994 and November 1995 cases appeared in 51 pig herds, among which direct or indirect trading contacts were confirmed for 36 of the herds. A total of 213 isolates from <b>pigs</b> with edema <b>disease</b> in Denmark and other countries and 23 E. coli O 139 isolates from pigs with diarrhea or healthy pigs were analyzed to characterize their O serogroups, HindIII ribotypes, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) types, and 183 of the isolates were also analyzed for their plasmid profiles.
