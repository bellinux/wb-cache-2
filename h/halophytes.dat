5|$|Diffusion {{of carbon}} dioxide and oxygen is {{approximately}} 10,000 times slower in water than in air. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming hypoxic (an environment with O2 concentration below 2mg/liter) and eventually completely anoxic where anaerobic bacteria thrive among the roots. Water also influences the intensity and spectral composition of light as it reflects off the water surface and submerged particles. Aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive, compete, and diversify in these environments. For example, their roots and stems contain large air spaces (aerenchyma) that regulate the efficient transportation of gases (for example, CO2 and O2) used in respiration and photosynthesis. Salt water plants (<b>halophytes)</b> have additional specialized adaptations, such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and osmoregulating their internal salt (NaCl) concentrations, to live in estuarine, brackish, or oceanic environments. Anaerobic soil microorganisms in aquatic environments use nitrate, manganese ions, ferric ions, sulfate, carbon dioxide, and some organic compounds; other microorganisms are facultative anaerobes and use oxygen during respiration when the soil becomes drier. The activity of soil microorganisms and the chemistry of the water reduces the oxidation-reduction potentials of the water. Carbon dioxide, for example, is reduced to methane (CH4) by methanogenic bacteria. The physiology of fish is also specially adapted to compensate for environmental salt levels through osmoregulation. Their gills form electrochemical gradients that mediate salt excretion in salt water and uptake in fresh water.|$|E

25|$|The living cycads {{are found}} {{across much of}} the {{subtropical}} and tropical parts of the world. The greatest diversity occurs in South and Central America. They are also found in Mexico, the Antilles, southeastern United States, Australia, Melanesia, Micronesia, Japan, China, Southeast Asia, India, Sri Lanka, Madagascar, and southern and tropical Africa, where at least 65 species occur. Some can survive in harsh desert or semi-desert climates (xerophytic), others in wet rain forest conditions, and some in both. Some can grow in sand or even on rock, some in oxygen-poor, swampy, bog-like soils rich in organic material. Some are able to grow in full sun, some in full shade, and some in both. Some are salt tolerant (<b>halophytes).</b>|$|E
500|$|In C4 plants, sodium is a {{micronutrient}} {{that aids}} metabolism, specifically in regeneration of phosphoenolpyruvate and synthesis of chlorophyll. In others, it substitutes for potassium in several roles, such as maintaining turgor pressure and aiding {{in the opening}} and closing of stomata. Excess sodium in the soil can limit [...] the uptake of water by decreasing the water potential, which may result in plant wilting; excess concentrations in the cytoplasm can lead to enzyme inhibition, which in turn causes necrosis and chlorosis. In response, some plants have developed mechanisms to limit sodium uptake in the roots, to store it in cell vacuoles, and restrict salt transport from roots to leaves; excess sodium may also be stored in old plant tissue, limiting the damage to new growth. <b>Halophytes</b> have adapted {{to be able to}} flourish in sodium rich environments.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{evaluated}} Cd-phytoextraction {{ability of the}} <b>halophyte</b> Cakile maritima comparatively to the glycophyte Brassica juncea commonly recommended for phytoextraction. Seedlings were grown in nutrient solution added with 0 – 100 M Cd for 21 days. Cd impaired growth in B. juncea but had no significant impact on C. maritima. The <b>halophyte</b> C. maritima maintained also higher photosynthetic activity than the glycophyte B. juncea. Cd decreased leaf chlorophyll (Chl) and carotenoids concentrations as well as PSII efficiency (Fv/Fm, Fv/F 0 and ˚PSII) in B. juncea while it increased intercellular CO 2 concentration in this species. Shoot Cd content was higher in the <b>halophyte</b> C. maritima reaching 1365 g g− 1 dw at 100 M while it was 548 g g− 1 dw in B. juncea at the same dose. The translocation factor (TF) was higher for C. maritima than for B. juncea at all external Cd doses.
