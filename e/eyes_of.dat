40|$|Written by {{the eminent}} German legal historian, Michael Stolleis, these two ‘Essays on Legal History’ offer an {{original}} and compelling {{history of the}} symbolism through which law is characterised as being 'above' us. In ‘The <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> the Law’, {{the history of this}} metaphor is followed from antiquity through to the present day: from the Greek <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Justice, the <b>eye</b> <b>of</b> the impartial judge of the Underworld, the <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> God watching past, present and future, the <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> the Prince, guiding his subjects, to the almighty <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> the Law. While our belief in the law may have become brittle, nothing escapes what is now the <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Big Brother. ‘In the Name of the Law’ takes up the various formulas used to legitimate the decisions of the courts, from the times of absolutism over the 19 th century until today. The speaker who speaks {{in the name of a}} higher being underlines his function: his authority comes from above. And it is ‘in the name of’ god, king, people, state, nation, or law, that a weak, earthly, justice receives its support. Book description from publisher website at: [URL]...|$|R
