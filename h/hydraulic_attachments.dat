40|$|This {{publication}} {{was prepared}} {{in an effort}} to assist utility companies, electrical contractors, manufacturers of aerial bucket trucks and hydraulic impact tools, insurers of these companies, electrical lineman, and maintenance personnel in avoiding the hazards of using metal reinforced hoses on aerial bucket trucks near energized power lines. The case of a 37 year old electrical lineman who died when he jumped from a burning aerial bucket and fell 35 feet to the ground was reviewed. At the time of the accident the lineman was sagging the center phase of a three phase, 12, 400 volt energized power line. A metal reinforced, rubber hydraulic hose was attached to an impact wrench the lineman was using. The hose simultaneously contacted two phases of the line, and the heat generated caused the hose to melt and rupture. The hydraulic fluid from the ruptured hose ignited on contact with the power line and the bucket became engulfed in flames. He attempted to jump to safety, but caught his foot {{on the side of the}} bucket and fell on his head and chest. NIOSH recommends that employers remove any metal reinforced hoses currently installed on any part of the boom, aerial bucket or <b>hydraulic</b> <b>attachments</b> of aerial bucket trucks used to work near energized power lines.

50|$|In recent years, {{hydraulic}} excavator capabilities have expanded far beyond excavation tasks. With {{the advent of}} <b>hydraulic</b> powered <b>attachments</b> such as a tiltrotator, breaker, a grapple or an auger, the excavator is frequently used in many applications other than excavation and with the tiltrotator attachment, actually serves as an effective tool carrier. Many excavators feature quick coupler (quick-attach) mounting systems for simplified attachment mounting, dramatically increasing the machine's utilization on the jobsite.|$|R
50|$|The skidders use {{the same}} 6V53 Detroit Diesel engine and {{steering}} gearbox as the M113, but utilized a more heavily built undercarriage and a 4-speed Clark powershift transmission. The skidder either came as a cable arch model, with a tilting tray to set the logs on (A <b>hydraulic</b> grapple <b>attachment</b> was later offered to fit over the cable fairleads). Or as a Clam-Bunk forwarder, with a Prentice grapple mounted {{on the roof of}} the cab. Dealers also modified the base tractor to handle various forestry and utility jobs.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the advent}} of <b>hydraulic</b> powered <b>attachments</b> such as a tiltrotator, breaker, a grapple or an auger, the backhoe is {{frequently}} used in many applications other than excavation and with the tiltrotator attachment, serves as an effective tool carrier. Many backhoes feature quick coupler (quick-attach) mounting systems for simplified attachment mounting, dramatically increasing the machine's utilization on the job site. Backhoes are usually employed together with loaders and bulldozers. Excavators that use a backhoe are sometimes called [...] "trackhoes" [...] by {{people who do not}} realize the name is due to the action of the bucket, not its location on a backhoe loader.|$|R
50|$|Some {{models of}} skid steer now {{also have an}} {{automatic}} attachment changer mechanism. This allows a driver to change between a variety of terrain handling, shaping, and leveling tools without having to leave the machine, by using a hydraulic control mechanism to latch onto the <b>attachments.</b> <b>Hydraulic</b> supply lines to powered attachments may be routed so that the couplings are located near the cab, and the driver {{does not need to}} leave the machine to connect or disconnect those supply lines.|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic {{excavators}} {{have been}} popular devices in construction field {{because of its}} multi-workings and economic efficiency. The mathematical models of excavators have many nonlinearities because of nonlinear opening characteristics and dead zone of main control valve, oil temperature variation, etc. The objective {{of this paper is}} to develop a simulator for hydraulic excavator using AMESim. Components and whole circuit are expressed graphically. Parameters and nonlinear characteristics are inputted in text style. The simulator can be used to forecast excavator behavior when new components, new mechanical <b>attachments,</b> <b>hydraulic</b> circuit changes, and new control algorithm are applied. The simulator could be a kind of development platform for various new excavators...|$|R
40|$|YesMost {{clinically}} available prosthetic feet have a rigid attachment or incorporate an “ankle” device allowing elastic articulation during stance, {{with the}} foot {{returning to a}} “neutral” position at toe-off. We investigated whether using a foot with a hydraulically controlled articulating ankle that allows the foot to be relatively dorsiflexed at toe-off and throughout swing would increase minimum toe clearance (MTC). Twenty-one people with unilateral transtibial amputation completed overground walking trials using their habitual prosthetic foot with rigid or elastic articulating attachment and a foot with a <b>hydraulic</b> ankle <b>attachment</b> (hyA-F). MTC and other kinematic variables were assessed across multiple trials. When using the hyA-F, mean MTC increased on both limbs (p= 0. 03). On the prosthetic limb this was {{partly due to the}} device being in its fully dorsiflexed position at toe-off, which reduced the “toes down” foot angle throughout swing (p = 0. 01). Walking speed also increased when using the hyA-F (p = 0. 001) and was associated with greater swing-limb hip flexion on the prosthetic side (p = 0. 04), which {{may have contributed to the}} increase in mean MTC. Variability in MTC increased on the prosthetic side when using the hyA-F (p = 0. 03), but this did not increase risk of tripping...|$|R

The rotary movement of the hybrid hydraulic excavator was achieved by a newly developed electric motor, fuel consumption could be reduced {{as the result of}} the speed inhibition when the excavator standby. The modeling of excavator’s <b>hydraulic</b> system, front-end <b>attachments</b> and revolving frame were built on the AMESim platform according to the installation and actual sizes of the hydraulic components. By setting the parameters of every component in the model, mechanical- electronic- hydraulic integrated simulation was achieved. The paper focused on the solutions of hydraulic system’s pressure fluctuation and poor simulation results of front-end attachments. As a conclusion, appropriate solutions and simulation results were proposed to improve the precision...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{steering}} system for working machines attachment is a mediator between operator and the environment, {{thus it is}} one of the main factors which influence the efficiency and safety of the operator's work. The subject of this article is the test stand which enables one to test various {{steering system}}s for the <b>hydraulic</b> driven working <b>attachment.</b> The test stand is designed and already build by authors. The close representation of the real working attachment manipulation conditions as well as the ability to connect various steering systems to it were the main design criterions. The first one was obtained by imitation of the maximal angular range and the maximal angular speed of the boom and the stick from the real working machine. The micro-controller ATmega 32 was used as a supervisory system of the mechanical arm. This solution grants the test stand the ability to attend various steering systems without major changes of its construction...|$|R

Fujian University of Technology; Xiamen University; Fuzhou University; Huaqiao University; University of WollongongThis paper {{designed and}} developed an integrated testing system for performance {{parameters of the}} Hydraulic excavator. Combined with sensing technology, computer technology and virtual instrument technology this system can detect six key parameters of the excavator including motor speed, <b>hydraulic</b> system pressure, <b>attachment</b> action time, swing speed, walking speed, current characteristics, so as to evaluate {{the performance of the}} excavator. The testing system takes full consideration of the interaction between the tester and driver, meanwhile, can automatically detect all parameters by using the parallel test method in order to make sure the whole test completed in one hour. As the testing system is designed base on the idea of modularization, it can add new modules to meet the functional requirements alone with the development of research in the future. This testing system can not only improve the test efficiency, but also be used as analysis tools for the research and optimization of performance parameters of excavators. 漏 (2012) Trans Tech Publications...|$|R
