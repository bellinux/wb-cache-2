Ayane has a threefold stake in this plot: she wants revenge for Raidou being changed into a monster, for Hayate being brainwashed {{in their attempt to}} realize Project Epsilon, and for the manipulation and death of Genra. At the end of the game, Ayane uses her ninpo ("ninja arts") spell to blow up the DOATEC Tri-Tower.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unclear}} {{how much of a}} {{concurrent}} increase in fishing for great white sharks <b>has</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> decline of great white shark populations from the 1970s to the present. No accurate global population numbers are available, but the great white shark is now considered vulnerable. Sharks taken during the long interval between birth and sexual maturity never reproduce, making population recovery and growth difficult.|$|E

5|$|Admiralty {{law is the}} {{particular}} body of national laws applied to maritime questions and offenses, as the uncertainty of sea voyages <b>has</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> sea {{to be viewed as}} a unique jurisdiction since antiquity. Rhodian, Roman, Byzantine, Trani, and Amalfian laws were important influences on the French, Genovese, and Hanseatic codes which established the first English courts of admiralty. Unlike the usual English common law system, the courts of admiralty hewed closer to Continental practice, leaving it open for abuse that contributed to the American Revolution. The adoption of the present constitution reintroduced admiralty law to the United States, but with a relatively larger sphere for trials by jury.|$|E
5|$|Business {{declined}} {{during the}} construction and blasting of the station, with many storefronts losing business and some even being forced to close. However, starting in 2013, construction of the station <b>has</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> value of real estate {{in the area to}} start to rise. Although the surrounding area's real estate prices had been declining since the 1990s, there had been increases in the purchases and leases of residential units around the area, causing real estate prices to rise again. On the Upper East Side, prices of real estate west of Third Avenue had historically been higher than prices east of there, but due to the subway's construction, prices of real estate east of the avenue had risen dramatically since the station's construction started. With the opening of the new station, business owners hoped to see an increase in patronage.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, Felix's {{party is}} able to achieve {{entrance}} into Piers' home, a legendary, secluded Atlantis-like society named Lemuria far out in the ocean. When they convene with Lemuria's ancient king, Hydros, they learn about Alchemy's true nature; {{it has always been}} the sustenance of Weyard's very life force, and its absence over the past ages <b>has</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> world's continents to decrease in size and parts of the world to collapse into the abyss. Knowing that restoring Alchemy is what must be done to actually save the world, Felix crosses the sea in order to activate Jupiter Lighthouse. But when Isaac's pursuing party enters the lighthouse, they are trapped and ambushed by Karst and Agatio. Felix rescues Isaac, but Karst and Agatio escape with the Mars Star formerly in Isaac's possession.|$|E
5|$|Human {{activities}} have affected stocks of {{many species of}} teleost, through overfishing, pollution and global warming. Among many recorded instances, overfishing caused the complete collapse of the Atlantic cod population off Newfoundland in 1992, leading to Canada's indefinite closure of the fishery. Pollution, especially in rivers and along coasts, has harmed teleosts as sewage, pesticides and herbicides have entered the water. Many pollutants, such as heavy metals, organochlorines, and carbamates interfere with teleost reproduction, often by disrupting their endocrine systems. In the roach, river pollution <b>has</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> intersex condition, in which an individual's gonads contain both cells that can make male gametes (such as spermatogonia) and cells that can make female gametes (such as oogonia). Since endocrine disruption also affects humans, teleosts are used to indicate the presence of such chemicals in water. Water pollution caused local extinction of teleost populations in many northern European lakes {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century.|$|E

When the Gunslinger arrives the next day, residents wearing facial markings similar to Jex race through town, confusing the cyborg and allowing Jex to flee to his ship. However, instead of taking off, Jex tells the Doctor he is ready to face justice in the afterlife, and causes the ship to self-destruct.|$|E

When {{she is about to}} be punished, the Obscurus attacks and kills Mary Lou and her eldest daughter Chastity. Graves arrives and after Credence leads him to the location of Modesty, dismisses him as being a Squib and refuses to teach him magic. Credence reveals he is the Obscurus's host, having lived longer than any other host due to the intensity of his magic. In a fit of rage, Credence transforms into an Obscurus and attacks the city.|$|E
5|$|On January 7, 1929, The Capitol Theatre, a major Jasper Avenue {{competitor}} to the Princess, {{closed for}} renovations promising {{a change that}} “will please every theatre-goer in Edmonton”. Almost three months later on March 27, the theatre reopened with dual Movietone and Vitaphone sound systems.

Parsifal is overcome with remorse, blaming himself for this state of affairs. Gurnemanz tells him that today is the day of Titurel's funeral, and that Parsifal has a great duty to perform. Kundry washes Parsifal's feet and Gurnemanz anoints him with water from the Holy Spring, recognizing him as the pure fool, now enlightened by compassion, and as the new King of the Knights of the Grail.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{renumbering}} in 2003, {{portions of}} US491 in New Mexico have been upgraded to a four-lane divided highway, with grade separations at the busiest interchanges. The New Mexico Department of Transportation has noted that, as sections are upgraded, fatality rates improve on the four-lane portions, but remain {{high on the}} two-lane portions. As construction has proceeded, the most dangerous portions of the highway have moved to points where the four-lane portion ends, and traffic merges to two lanes. This <b>has</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> department to coordinate the phases of the upgrades to minimize the number of two-lane/four-lane transitions. Construction on the final phase was originally scheduled to begin January 2008, however the state applied for American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds to finish the project and completion was delayed until 2012.|$|E
5|$|Testing often {{including}} {{observing the}} colour of the fluid, measuring CSF pressure, and counting and identifying {{white and red}} blood cells within the fluid; measuring protein and glucose levels; and culturing the fluid. The presence of red blood cells and xanthochromia may indicate subarachnoid hemorrhage; whereas central nervous system infections such as meningitis, may be indicated by elevated white blood cell levels. A CSF culture may yield the microorganism that <b>has</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> infection, or PCR {{may be used to}} identify a viral cause. Investigations to the total type and nature of proteins reveal point to specific diseases, including multiple sclerosis, paraneoplastic syndromes, systemic lupus erythematosus, neurosarcoidosis, cerebral angiitis; and specific antibodies such as Aquaporin 4 may be tested for to assist in the diagnosis of autoimmune conditions. A lumbar puncture that drains CSF may also be used as part of treatment for some conditions, including idiopathic intracranial hypertension and normal pressure hydrocephalus.|$|E
5|$|The northwestern and {{northern}} {{portions of the}} Yucatán Peninsula experience lower rainfall {{than the rest of}} the peninsula; these regions feature highly porous limestone bedrock resulting in less surface water. This limestone geology results in most rainwater filtering directly through the bedrock to the phreatic zone, from whence it slowly flows to the coasts to form large submarine springs. Various freshwater springs rise along the coast to form watering holes. The filtering of rainwater through the limestone <b>has</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> formation of extensive cave systems. These cave rooves are subject to collapse forming deep sinkholes; if the bottom of the cave is deeper than the groundwater level then a cenote is formed.|$|E
