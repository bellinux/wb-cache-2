5|$|Gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, are giant planets {{primarily}} {{composed of}} {{hydrogen and helium}} and are the most massive planets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> Jupiter, at 318 Earth masses, is the largest planet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> and Saturn is one third as massive, at 95 Earth masses.|$|E
5|$|Also if {{assuming}} a radius of one AU, then {{there may not}} be sufficient building material <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> to construct a Dyson shell. Anders Sandberg estimates that there is 1.82 kg of easily usable building material <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> enough for a 1-AU shell with a mass of 600kg/m2—about 8–20cm thick on average, depending on the density of the material. This includes the hard-to-access cores of the gas giants; the inner planets alone provide only 11.79 kg, enough for a 1-AU shell with a mass of just 42kg/m2.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{remaining}} irregular moons, Sao and Laomedeia follow prograde orbits, whereas Halimede, Psamathe and Neso follow retrograde orbits. Given {{the similarity of}} their orbits, {{it was suggested that}} Neso and Psamathe could have a common origin in the break-up of a larger moon. Psamathe and Neso have the largest orbits of any natural satellites discovered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>system</b> to date. They take 25 years to orbit Neptune at an average of 125 times the distance between Earth and the Moon. Neptune has the largest Hill sphere <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> owing primarily to its large distance from the Sun; this allows it to retain control of such distant moons. Nevertheless, Jupiter's S/2003 J 2 orbits at the greatest percentage of the primary's Hill radius of all the moons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> on average, and the Jovian moons in the Carme and Pasiphae groups orbit at a greater percentage of their primary's Hill radius than Psamathe and Neso.|$|E

5|$|Ethan Siegel, who {{is deeply}} {{skeptical of the}} {{existence}} of an undiscovered new planet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> nevertheless speculates that at least one super-Earth, which have been commonly discovered in other planetary systems but have not been discovered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> might have been ejected from the Solar System during a dynamical instability in the early Solar System. Hal Levison thinks that the chance of an ejected object ending up in the inner Oort cloud is only about 2%, and speculates that many objects must have been thrown past the Oort cloud if one has entered a stable orbit.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede (Jupiter III), {{the third}} Galilean moon {{is named after}} the mythological Ganymede, cupbearer of the Greek gods and Zeus's beloved. Ganymede is the largest natural {{satellite}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> at 5262.4 kilometers in diameter, which makes it larger than the planet Mercury – although only at about half of its mass since Ganymede is an icy world. It is the only satellite <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> known to possess a magnetosphere, likely created through convection within the liquid iron core.|$|E
5|$|Giant planets can {{significantly}} influence terrestrial planet formation. The presence of giants tends to increase eccentricities and inclinations (see Kozai mechanism) of planetesimals and embryos in the terrestrial planet region (inside 4AU <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System).</b> If giant planets form too early, they can slow or prevent inner planet accretion. If they form {{near the end}} of the oligarchic stage, as is thought to have happened <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> they will influence the merges of planetary embryos, making them more violent. As a result, the number of terrestrial planets will decrease and they will be more massive. In addition, the size of the system will shrink, because terrestrial planets will form closer to the central star. The influence of giant planets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> particularly that of Jupiter, is thought to have been limited because they are relatively remote from the terrestrial planets.|$|E

5|$|The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star. It {{contains}} almost 99.9percent of all {{the mass}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Sun, which {{comprises}} {{nearly all}} the matter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> is composed of roughly 98% hydrogen and helium. Jupiter and Saturn, which comprise {{nearly all the}} remaining matter, are also primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. A composition gradient exists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> created by heat and light pressure from the Sun; those objects closer to the Sun, which are more affected by heat and light pressure, are composed of elements with high melting points. Objects farther from the Sun are composed largely of materials with lower melting points. The boundary <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> beyond which those volatile substances could condense {{is known as the}} frost line, and it lies at roughly 5 AU from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The Uranian {{satellite}} {{system is the}} least massive among those of the giant planets. Indeed, the combined mass of the five major satellites {{is less than half}} that of Triton (the seventh-largest moon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System)</b> alone. The largest of the satellites, Titania, has a radius of 788.9km, or less than half that of the Moon, but slightly more than that of Rhea, the second-largest moon of Saturn, making Titania the eighth-largest moon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> Uranus is about 10,000times more massive than its moons.|$|E
50|$|Bodies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> {{have been}} {{considered}} for terraforming and space colonization.

5|$|The {{gravitational}} perturbations of {{the other}} planets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> combine to modify the orbit of the Earth and the orientation of its spin axis. These changes can influence the planetary climate.|$|E
5|$|The planet's {{most famous}} feature is its {{prominent}} ring {{system that is}} composed mostly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 62 moons are known to orbit Saturn, of which 53 are officially named. This {{does not include the}} hundreds of moonlets in the rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon, and the second-largest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> is larger than the planet Mercury, although less massive, and is the only moon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> to have a substantial atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotational}} {{period and}} seasonal cycles of Mars are likewise {{similar to those}} of Earth, as is the tilt that produces the seasons. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and second-highest known mountain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> The smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.|$|E
50|$|The {{abundance}} of helium-3 {{is thought to}} be greater on the Moon than on Earth, having been embedded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper layer of regolith by <b>the</b> <b>solar</b> wind over billions of years, though still lower in quantity than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system's</b> gas giants.|$|R

5|$|Callisto (Jupiter IV) is {{the fourth}} and last Galilean moon, and is the second largest of the four, and at 4820.6 {{kilometers}} in diameter, it is the third largest moon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> and barely smaller than Mercury, though {{only a third of}} the latter's mass. It is named after the Greek mythological nymph Callisto, a lover of Zeus who was a daughter of the Arkadian King Lykaon and a hunting companion of the goddess Artemis. The moon does not form part of the orbital resonance that affects three inner Galilean satellites and thus does not experience appreciable tidal heating. Callisto is composed of approximately equal amounts of rock and ices, which makes it the least dense of the Galilean moons.
