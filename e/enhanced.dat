40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that <b>enhancing</b> lesions on contrast-enhanced T 1 -weighted MR images are predictive of impending exacerbations in cases of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. We examined whether <b>enhancing</b> lesions, new en-hancing lesions, and new hypointense lesions (‘‘black holes’’) could accurately predict exacer-bations in a cohort of 50 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis within a time frame of up to 6 months. METHODS: Data were obtained from 50 patients with relapsing-remitting disease. All pa-tients underwent monthly MR imaging and clinical examinations for a period of 12 months. Putative predictors of clinical relapse were defined from <b>enhancing</b> lesions, new <b>enhancing</b> lesions, and new black hole outcomes, and their operating characteristics were studied. RESULTS: Overall, the positive predictive values (PV 1) of <b>enhancing</b> lesions, new <b>enhancing</b> lesions, or new black holes for an exacerbation did not exceed 0. 25 and the negative predictive values (PV 2) were all near 0. 9. The best predictor for new <b>enhancing</b> lesions was the occur-rence of new <b>enhancing</b> lesions in each of the previous 3 months (PV 1 : 0. 79 [95 % confidenc...|$|R
