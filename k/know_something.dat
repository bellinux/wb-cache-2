25|$|Tariq A. Al-Maeena, a {{columnist}} for the Saudi Gazette, used the quotation on August 23, 2017 (“Netanyahu is calculatedly following the game plan set by his mentor Ariel Sharon, a former Israeli prime minister who once said in a recorded interview: ‘I don’t <b>know</b> <b>something</b> called International Principles. I vow that I’ll burn every Palestinian child (that) will be born in this area.’”).|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{demonstration}} of Pythagoras' theorem, the dialogue takes an epistemological turn when the interlocutors begin to discuss the fundamental nature of knowledge. The general question asked is how one can claim to <b>know</b> <b>something</b> when one does not even know what knowledge is. Via the Socratic method, it is shown {{that the answer to}} the question posed is innateness – one possesses a priori knowledge.|$|E
25|$|In the English-speaking world, {{many people}} who {{otherwise}} might not {{have heard of the}} landing at Suvla Bay <b>know</b> <b>something</b> of its history through the song And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda written in 1972 by Eric Bogle and covered by numerous artists including the Clancy Brothers, Joan Baez and the Pogues. The song, while emotionally charged and vivid, is not an accurate historical account of the landing and subsequent events. Suvla also appears in the traditional Irish song The Foggy Dew commemorating the 1916 Easter Rising.|$|E

25|$|There {{are mixed}} results in how {{important}} phonological information is to deaf individuals when reading {{and when that}} information is obtained. Alphabets, abugidas, abjads, and syllabaries all seem to require the reader/writer to <b>know</b> <b>something</b> about the phonology of their target language prior to learning the system. Profoundly deaf children {{do not have access}} to the same auditory base that hearing children do. Orally trained deaf children do not always use phonological information in reading tasks, word recognition tasks or homophonic tasks; however, deaf signers who are not orally trained do utilize phonological information in word-rhyming tasks. Furthermore when performing on tasks with phonologically confusable initial sounds, hearing readers made more errors than deaf readers. Yet when given sentences that are sublexically confusable when translated into ASL, deaf readers made more errors than hearing readers. The body of literature clearly shows that skilled deaf readers can employ phonological skills, even if they don’t all the time; without additional longitudinal studies it is uncertain if a profoundly deaf person must <b>know</b> <b>something</b> about the phonology of the target language to become a skilled reader (less than 75% of the deaf population) or if by becoming a skilled reader a deaf person learns how to employ phonological skills of the target language.|$|E
25|$|Plato was {{the first}} philosopher who {{systematically}} inquired into issues such as those noted above. He wrote many dialogues, such as Euthyphro and the Apology, but {{it is from the}} Meno that the modern instantiation of Plato's Problem is derived. In the Meno, Plato theorizes about the relationship between knowledge and experience and provides an explanation for how it is possible to <b>know</b> <b>something</b> that one has never been explicitly taught. Plato believed that we possess innate ideas that precede any knowledge that we gain through experience.|$|E
25|$|Foote {{was destined}} for the law, but {{certainly}} not by nature. In his chambers at the Inner Temple, and in the Grecian Coffee House nearby, he came to <b>know</b> <b>something</b> of lawyers if not of law, and was afterwards able to jest at the jargon and to mimic the mannerisms of the bar, and to satirize the Latitats of the other branch of the profession with particular success. Though he never applied himself to his studies at the Inner Temple, he well applied himself to spending money and living as a bon vivant which led to him quickly running out of funds.|$|E

25|$|Since I am anxious {{that you}} should all <b>know</b> <b>something</b> about my trip and the {{condition}} of the country as we find it in British East Africa, I am sending this general letter. I have had my first visit to a native village where goats, sheep and human beings occupy the same hut. The houses are built of bamboo and thatched with grass; the center or highest point is about ten feet, sloping to the outer edge until the door or hole to crawl through is about three feet high.... The chief occupation for the men is herding goats; the women do the gardening, wood chopping, carrying of heavy loads, etc. The women carried all our trunks and baggage from the depot up to the mission station, a distance of about three miles. It is considered a disgrace for a man to carry a load of wood, pail of water, etc.|$|E
500|$|Lu said of {{his role}} as {{legislative}} director, [...] "It's {{one of the most}} fun jobs in the Senate (but) it's also an incredibly difficult job because you have to <b>know</b> <b>something</b> about any given thing going on in the Senate at the time ... It takes a couple years off your life." [...] Lu, along with Robert Gibbs and several other Obama staffers, read Obama's manuscript for The Audacity of Hope and provided him with several editorial suggestions.|$|E
500|$|Along with tarot divination, astrology {{is one of}} {{the core}} studies of Western esotericism, and as such has {{influenced}} systems of magical belief not only among Western esotericists and Hermeticists, but also belief systems such as Wicca that have borrowed from or been influenced by the Western esoteric tradition. Tanya Luhrmann has said that [...] "all magicians <b>know</b> <b>something</b> about astrology," [...] and refers to a table of correspondences in Starhawk's The Spiral Dance, organised by planet, {{as an example of the}} astrological lore studied by magicians.|$|E

500|$|Regarding the 1939 New York World's Fair {{itself and}} its futuristic theme of the World of Tomorrow, Conran noted: [...] "...obviously the title refers to the World Expo {{and the spirit of}} that was looking at the future with a sense of {{optimism}} and a sense of the whimsical, you <b>know,</b> <b>something</b> that we've lost a lot in our fantasies. We're more cynical, more practical, ... I think what this film attempts to do is to take that enthusiasm and innocence and celebrate it-to not get mired in the practicality that we're fixated upon today." ...|$|E
500|$|Film {{scholars}} and historians view Citizen Kane as Welles's {{attempt to create}} a new style of filmmaking by studying various forms of film making, and combining them all into one. However, Welles stated that his love for cinema began only when he started the work on the film. When asked where he got the confidence as a first-time director to direct a film so radically different from contemporary cinema, he responded, [...] "Ignorance, ignorance, sheer ignorance—you know there's no confidence to equal it. It's only when you <b>know</b> <b>something</b> about a profession, I think, that you're timid or careful." ...|$|E
500|$|I can {{at times}} feel {{strongly}} the beauties, you describe, in themselves & for themselves — but more frequently all things appear little — all knowledge, {{that can be}} acquired, child's play — the universe itself—what but an immense heap of little things? — I can contemplate nothing but parts, & parts are all little — ! — My mind feels as if it ached to behold & <b>know</b> <b>something</b> great — something one & indivisible — {{and it is only}} in the faith of this that rocks or waterfalls, mountains or caverns give me the sense of sublimity or majesty! — But in this faith all things counterfeit infinity! ...|$|E

500|$|Although he did {{not often}} write or speak about it, Tolkien {{advocated}} {{the dismantling of the}} British Empire and even of the United Kingdom. In a 1936 letter to a former student, Belgian linguist Simonne d'Ardenne, he wrote, [...] "The political situation is dreadful... I have the greatest sympathy with Belgium—which is about the right size of any country! I wish my own were bounded still by the seas of the Tweed and the walls of Wales... we folk do at least <b>know</b> <b>something</b> of mortality and eternity and when Hitler (or a Frenchman) says 'Germany (or France) must live forever' we know that he lies." ...|$|E
500|$|Philosophers of mind {{call the}} {{subjective}} aspects of mental events [...] "qualia" [...] or [...] "raw feels". There {{is something that}} {{it is like to}} feel pain, to see a familiar shade of blue, and so on. There are qualia involved in these mental events that seem particularly difficult to reduce to anything physical. David Chalmers explains this argument by stating that we could conceivably know all the objective information about something, such as the brain states and wavelengths of light involved with seeing the color red, but still not <b>know</b> <b>something</b> fundamental about the situation – {{what it is like to}} see the color red.|$|E
500|$|Anggun {{success is}} Europe and America has been {{credited}} with helping other Asian singers such as Coco Lee, Utada Hikaru, and Tata Young. Malaysian singer Yuna asked Anggun's guidance when launching her recording career in the United States in 2011. Ian De Cotta from Singapore newspaper Today called her the [...] "Voice of Asia" [...] as well as [...] "Southeast Asia's international singing sensation." [...] Filipino journalist Lionel Zivan S. Valdellon described Anggun as [...] "a very good ambassadress for Indonesia and Asia in general". Regarding the role of Asia in Western music industry, Anggun said [...] "I think it's about time people <b>know</b> <b>something</b> more about Asia, {{not only as a}} vacation place." ...|$|E

500|$|The song {{references}} drugs both metaphorically and literally, and innocently {{delivers a}} transgressive message {{through the use}} of simile: [...] "I'm going to do you like drugs tonight". Miguel said of the song's lyrics, [...] "I have this propensity to just come out and say things. That's how I am in real life. If I wanna <b>know</b> <b>something</b> I just ask. Like, 'Hey, do you like drugs?' Because I do! Sometimes! ... MDMA… on occasion." [...] Alex Macpherson of The Guardian observes [...] "faded psychedelia" [...] and [...] "promises of narcotic [...] " [...] in the song's lyrics. Pitchfork Medias Carrie Battan said that [...] "Do You..." [...] is [...] "not so much about being in love as about a shared love of vices." ...|$|E
500|$|In her youth, Wintour {{was educated}} at the {{independent}} North London Collegiate School, where she frequently rebelled against {{the dress code}} by taking up the hemlines of her skirts. At the age of 14, she began wearing {{her hair in a}} bob. She developed an interest in fashion as a regular viewer of Cathy McGowan on Ready Steady Go!, and from the issues of Seventeen which her grandmother sent from the United States. [...] "Growing up in London in the '60s, you'd have to have had Irving Penn's sack over your head not to <b>know</b> <b>something</b> extraordinary was happening in fashion," [...] she recalled. Her father regularly consulted her when he was considering ideas for increasing readership in the youth market.|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the album {{took place at}} Record Plant, RCA Studios, and Capitol Recording Studios in Los Angeles in April 1975. Streisand and Columbia Records released Lazy Afternoon on October 1, 1975. It features handwritten liner notes developed by Streisand herself; she opened the booklet by writing, [...] "While I usually let the vinyl speak for itself, I really had fun making this record, and I thought it might interest you to <b>know</b> <b>something</b> about each song. After all, I wouldn't {{want to be a}} chef who doesn't share her secrets!" [...] Additionally, the label issued the album as an 8-track cartridge later in 1975, with the track listing switching the order of [...] "By the Way" [...] and [...] "Widescreen" [...] around. The album was later released in a compact disc format on October 25, 1990.|$|E
