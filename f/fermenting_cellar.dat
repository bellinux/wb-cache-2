50|$|In 1869, an {{explosion}} in the <b>fermenting</b> <b>cellar</b> caused a massive fire to engulf the building, destroying the wooden interior, but leaving the stone and machinery largely undamaged. The building was reconstructed and reopened in May 1870.|$|E
5000|$|Neuweiler Brewery, {{also known}} as Germania Brewery, is a {{historic}} brewery complex located at Allentown, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania. The complex was built between 1911 and 1913, and consists of the office building, brew house, stock house, pump house, wash house, chemistry lab building, boiler room, bottling house, garage, <b>fermenting</b> <b>cellar,</b> and smokestack with the name [...] "Neuweiler" [...] on it. The office building is a two-story, brick and granite building. The remaining buildings in the complex are built of brick. The brew house stands six-stories, and has a copper hipped roof with cupola. The stock house is a long, narrow four-story building. The brewery closed in 1968.|$|E

50|$|In 1880, {{part of the}} {{original}} Georgian brewery was rebuilt: the Tower and Brew House visible for example from Cliffe Bridge. This {{is an example of a}} country brewery with a facade in a rustic Neo-Gothic design of the Victorian era, a listed building at Grade II*. Behind it stands another half: the Georgian <b>fermenting</b> room, <b>cellars</b> and Vat House. The fermenting room, Brew House and cellars have not changed in layout and dimensions, although reinforced and their contents have evolved. The Vat House was converted and expanded into the modern bottling process.|$|R
50|$|Process engineeringBreweries can be {{completely}} equipped with brewhouses, including <b>fermenting</b> and storage <b>cellar</b> equipment, along with assigned supply installations. Further, the company supplies syrup areas, mixing and carbonising equipment for manufacturing plants of non-alcoholic beverages. Heating systems as UHT- and flash heating systems or pasteurizing systems {{are available for}} beverage preservation.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{theoretical}} part of the thesis is the study and {{the treatment of the}} problem of the manufacturing of beer, focused on the czech conditions and classical Czech technology. Within {{the theoretical}} part the history of this branch of industry together with the modern methods, enabling greater productivity of beer production, are summarized. Experimental part of the thesis was carried out in a small brewery in Czech republic, producing aproximately 10 000 hl per year. In this brewery the selected parameters were studied not only in the course of cooking and fermentation of beer, but during the output control in racking to the drums and plastic bottles, as well. The studied parameters were as follows: the sugar content of front and wort, the control of microbiological contamination in <b>fermenting</b> <b>cellar</b> and in beer-storage cellar, the content of CO 2 by last stage of fermentation and pH- value and color by the end-product...|$|E
50|$|The main {{fields of}} {{application}} include the automation of breweries (see brewery) and/or <b>fermenting</b> and storage <b>cellars.</b> Also a complete automation {{of all the}} production areas of a brewery (e.g. at Warsteiner Beer and Brewery) - from raw material intake to filling - can be realised with the brewmaxx process control systems. The “small” control system, brewmaxx compact, has been available for individual production areas, e.g. ancillary plants, water treatment, filter or CO2 plants as well as small and medium-sized breweries, {{since the middle of}} 2010.|$|R
50|$|During World War Two, Franco {{helped his}} father wall up the family’s old Riservas {{just before the}} Front passed through the area in 1944. Years later, he held a number of {{vertical}} tastings with these Riservas—going back to the late 1800s—that demonstrated the wine's aging capacity. The winery has maintained a non-interventionist approach in the <b>cellar,</b> <b>fermenting</b> the wine only by means of native yeasts and using only large, neutral Slavonian casks, as Sangiovese is naturally rich in tannins and {{does not need to}} be supplemented by the wood tannins imparted by small barriques. He was always a defender of a 100% Sangiovese Brunello di Montalcino, even at times when his wines were considered old-fashioned.|$|R
40|$|The {{content of}} this thesis is the {{documentation}} {{for the project}} of Microbrewery in Hodonin. This microbrewery is a detached building on building plot in the urban area of Hodonin. In the building is located a microbewery with planed beer production 3500 hl per year and restaurant for 150 guest with the summer terrace planed for 35 guests. Building is a ground floor structure with cellar under the part of it. The ground floor is divided into the section for guest and a part for restaurant’s services with kitchen, storages and background for employees. In the restaurant is located a brewhouse which is a heart of the object. Microbrewery – <b>fermenting</b> room, lager <b>cellar,</b> tank cellar, boiler room, engine room for ventilation, storage of barrels and drinks {{are located in the}} basement. Bearing system is formed by walls- in the ground floor by ceramic blocks and monolithic concrete walls, in the basement by the concrete formwork blocks. The building is insulated. The roof above the kitchen and the restroom for guests is a flat roof. The roof above the restaurant consists of a wooden chest nailed trusses with a slope of 4 %. As the roof covering is used a PVC foi...|$|R
