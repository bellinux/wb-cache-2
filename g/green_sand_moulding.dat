The mould cavity prepared under chemical bonded <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> system must produce sufficient permeability and hardness to withstand sand drop while pouring molten metal through ladle.

Experimental matrices of central composite design allow conducting minimum experiments that provide complete insight of the process. Statistical significance of influencing variables and their interaction were determined to control the process. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was conducted to validate the model statistically. Mathematical equation was derived separately for mould hardness and permeability, which are expressed as a non-linear function of input variables based on the collected experimental input-output data.

Temperature and the evolution of partial gas pressure have been analysed in moulds bonded with bentonite with or without the addition of seacoal, water glass or furan resin. Moulds were poured with ductile iron. For comparison, also tests with the grey iron have been executed. It was found that the gas atmosphere near the interface depends mainly on the content of a carbonaceous substance in the <b>mould.</b> In the <b>green</b> <b>sand</b> <b>moulds</b> with 5 % of seacoal or bonded with furan resin, after the mould filling, a sudden increase in the hydrogen content and the drop of oxygen is observed. This gas evolution results from the oxidation of carbon and reduction of water vapour in the mould material, and also from the reduction of water vapour and alloy reoxidation. In carbon-free sand, the evolution in the gas composition is slower because water vapour is reduced only at the interface.

40|$|Industrial {{processing}} of materials containing quartz induces physico-chemical modifications {{that contribute to}} the variability of quartz hazard in different plants. Here, modifications affecting a quartz-rich sand during cast iron production, have been investigated. Composition, morphology, presence of radicals associated to quartz and reactivity in free radical generation were studied on a raw sand and on a dust recovered after mould dismantling. Additionally, cytotoxicity of the processed dust and ROS and NO generation were evaluated on MH-S macrophages. Particle morphology and size were marginally affected by casting processing, which caused only a slight increase of the amount of respirable fraction. The raw sand was able to catalyze •OH and CO 2 •– generation in cell-free test, even if in a lesser extent than the reference quartz (Min-U-Sil), and shows hAl radicals, conventionally found in any quartz-bearing raw materials. Enrichment in iron and extensive coverage with amorphous carbon were observed during processing. They likely contributed, respectively, to increasing the ability of processed dust to release CO 2 •–and to suppressing •OH generation respect to the raw sand. Carbon coverage and repeated thermal treatments during industrial processing also caused annealing of radiogenic hAl defects. Finally, no cellular responses were observed with the respirable fraction of the processed powder.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{concerns}} {{the formation of}} pinholes in castings by reaction between cast iron with compacted graphite and <b>green</b> <b>sand</b> <b>mould.</b> Methodology: Experiments were done on bar castings moulded in green bentonite mixtures without carbonaceous matters. <b>Moulding</b> <b>sand</b> moisture and aluminium content in the melt were purposely changed. Metal was melted in a 100 kg furnace by remelting the uniform charge of return material. Metal was inoculated all at once in a ladle and modified in a reaction chamber in a mould or as sandwich method in a pouring ladle. Findings: The formation of pinholes was not caused by high moisture of the mould but this defect was sensible to aluminium content in metal. In castings with high aluminium content > 0. 2 % the pinholes occurred in high numbers, and namely under low and also high moistures (> 4 %). In previous melts with aluminium contents < 0. 02 % defects occurred in small range. Practical implications: Thus the conclusions known from literature {{about the influence of}} Al on pinholes occurrence in cast irons were confirmed. Oxygen activity in metal during its flowing and cooling in the mould was also measured but this quantity was not changed too in dependence on pinholes content. Morphological analyses near the defect have indicated that it is a physical type of pinholes caused by hydrogen. Originality: A number of works were aimed at explanation of causes of pinholes formation in lamellar graphite iron castings and spheroidal graphite ones. But this defect is formed in castings from compacted graphite cast iron too and the research was aimed just to this material. The contribution is in such a way an exceptional one...|$|R

The quasi-solid–liquid transition feature of granular materials can be considered as an appropriate basis for further studying the deformation of shear area when cutting <b>sand</b> <b>mould.</b> In order to improve the integrity and accuracy of <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> structure and reduce the tool wear by controlling the size of cutting force, in this paper, the quasi-solid–liquid transition theory of granular system is introduced into the parallel-sided shear zone model of the cutting process to analyze the flow stress of shear zone.

30|$|According to the {{constitutive}} equation of <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> shear zone (Eq. (23)), for the <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> with uniform grain size, {{there are two}} aspects {{of the influence of}} particle size on cutting force. One is the static strength of <b>sand</b> <b>mould,</b> the other are the linear and quadric terms of shear rate which are the momentum and kinetic energy of the moving sand respectively. In general, the static strength of <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> increases with the increase of the diameter of sand, and the momentum and kinetic energy of the single sand also increase with the diameter of sand particles. So the cutting force of the <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> increases with the diameter increasing. However, the sand granularity in the <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> is of 70 / 140, which means that the size of sand distributes randomly within a certain range. Therefore, the distributions of the sand particles and strength are non-uniform. In the <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> cutting process, when cutting the large sand particle or the region with higher strength, the cutting forces will increase. Otherwise, cutting forces will decrease. In the {{constitutive equation}}s of prediction model (Eq. (23)), the compression strength σs is calculated as the macroscopical experimental results of the <b>sand</b> <b>mould,</b> and the <b>sand</b> particle diameter is calculated as an average diameter. That means the predictive model does not consider the effect of non-homogeneity, so the fluctuation of predicted cutting force is lower than the measured results.|$|R

So, the process of cutting <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> is similar to the process of the granules transition from solid state to liquid state.

In order to realize the prediction and control of the cutting force in the <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> milling process, an analytical model of cutting force is proposed based on the unequal division shear zone model of orthogonal cutting.
