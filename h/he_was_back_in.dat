5|$|Between 1926 and 1927, Cooper {{discussed}} {{the plans for}} Pan American Airways with John Hambleton, which was formed during 1927. Cooper {{was a member of}} the board of directors of Pan American Airways. During his tenure at Pan Am, the company established the first regularly scheduled transatlantic service. While he was on the board, Cooper did not devote his full attention to the organization; he took time in 1929 and 1930 to work on the script for King Kong. By 1931, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> Hollywood. He resigned from the board of directors in 1935, following health complications.|$|E

5|$|Burgoyne lost 1,000 {{men in the}} two battles, {{leaving him}} outnumbered by roughly 3 to 1; American losses came to about 500 killed and wounded. Burgoyne had also lost several of his most {{effective}} leaders, his attempts to capture the American position had failed, and his forward line was now breached. That night he lit fires at his remaining forward positions and withdrew {{under the cover of}} darkness. On the morning of October 8, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the fortified positions he had held on September 16. By October 13 he was surrounded at Saratoga, and on October 17 he surrendered his army. The remnants of his expedition retreated from Ticonderoga back to Quebec.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1915 Dyer {{was through}} with Australia, the New Zealand Truth {{reporting}} that he had left by 4 December, and by Christmas Eve the American press were already announcing his arrival in the States. In January, Dyer was in San Francisco, where he fought local boxer Bob McAllister, losing on points in a four-round contest. He then travelled to the East Coast and to New York, and on 6 May 1916 <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the ring, in a ten-round fight with local boxer Tommy Maloney. The fight went the distance ending in a draw, though local newspapers gave the decision to Maloney. After the fight Dyer entertained the crowd with an operatic song.|$|E
5|$|England beat Scotland 7–2 in April 1955, {{and this}} time Matthews linked up much better with Revie, and 40-year-old Matthews was largely {{credited}} for the outstanding margin of victory. In this game Duncan Edwards was making his England debut; when Matthews made his, Edwards had not even been born. Matthews went on England's unsuccessful tour of the continent in 1955, as the selectors erratic choices helped to ensure a 1–0 defeat to France, a 1–1 draw with Spain, and a 3–1 defeat to Portugal. Left out against Denmark, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the team in October for a 1–1 draw with Wales.|$|E

5|$|Mason, {{along with}} a group of other Advanced Liberals {{supporting}} John Morley, the gladstonian, was one of the founding members of the Reform Club in Manchester, a political club founded in 1867 for Liberals and their supporters. Despite retiring from local politics because of conflict with the Liberals, by 1878 <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> favour and Liberal councillors were encouraging Mason to stand for parliamentary election. Although he was a popular candidate, he was initially reluctant to put himself forward. However, he stood for Parliament in the 1880 General Elections. His campaign in March and April 1880 involved vitriolic attacks on the local Conservative Party and on 3April 1880 he was elected MP for Ashton-under-Lyne, beating his opponent, John Ross Coulthart, by 2,966 votes to 2,586.|$|E
5|$|No battles are {{recorded}} during the campaign, and chronicles do not record its outcome. By September, however, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> {{the south of}} England at Buckingham, where Constantine witnessed a charter as subregulus, that is a king acknowledging Æthelstan's overlordship. In 935 a charter was attested by Constantine, Owain of Strathclyde, Hywel Dda, Idwal Foel, and Morgan ap Owain. At Christmas {{of the same year}} Owain of Strathclyde was once more at Æthelstan's court along with the Welsh kings, but Constantine was not. His return to England less than two years later would be in very different circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{government}} of the Oregon Territory arrived in March 1849, a new legislature with two chambers was established. Lovejoy was elected to the first session of this legislature, first serving in the lower chamber Oregon House of Representatives.

5|$|When rehearsals {{opened in}} September 1955, Rodgers {{assembled}} {{the cast and}} told them that he was going into the hospital for a minor operation. In fact, Rodgers had been diagnosed with cancer of the jawbone. He spent the weekend before the operation writing one final song for Pipe Dream. The surgery required removal of part of the jawbone and tongue, and some of the lymph nodes. The operation took place on September 21, 1955; within ten days of the operation <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the theatre watching rehearsals, though for some time only as a spectator.|$|E
5|$|When {{this was}} {{effected}} in 1090, John {{became the first}} Bishop of Bath, and St Peter's was raised to cathedral status. As the roles of bishop and abbot had been combined, the monastery became a priory, run by its prior. With the elevation of the abbey to cathedral status, {{it was felt that}} a larger, more up-to-date building was required. John of Tours planned a new cathedral on a grand scale, dedicated to Saint Peter and Saint Paul, but only the ambulatory was complete when he died in December 1122. He was buried in the cathedral. The most renowned scholar monk based in the abbey was Adelard of Bath; after his various travels <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the monastery by 1106.|$|E

Friedman chose the latter, thus earning a Master of Arts degree in 1933. He was strongly influenced by Jacob Viner, Frank Knight, and Henry Simons. It was at Chicago that Friedman met his future wife, economist Rose Director. During the 1933–1934 academic year he had a fellowship at Columbia University, where he studied statistics with renowned statistician and economist Harold Hotelling. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> Chicago for the 1934–1935 academic year, working as a research assistant for Henry Schultz, who was then working on Theory and Measurement of Demand.

5|$|Alexander {{spent most}} of 1145 and 1146 at the papal court in Rome, {{although}} some time during that period he was in England {{as one of the}} witnesses to the peace accord signed between the earls of Chester and Leicester. He returned to the papal court, then at Auxerre, in 1147, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> England by {{the time of his death}} the following year. Henry of Huntingdon says that Alexander picked up his last illness while travelling. Alexander died in February 1148, probably on the 20th, as that was the date on which his death was commemorated at Lincoln Cathedral, and he was buried at Lincoln on 25 February 1148. No tomb remains, but 12th-century documents record that Alexander left the cathedral a number of books, mostly biblical works.|$|E

5|$|Guido Forti, after {{discussing}} {{the matter with}} commercial rights-owner Bernie Ecclestone, had decided to withdraw the team from the German GP as negotiations over the team's ownership between himself and Shannon continued, despite {{the threat of the}} FIA (F1's governing body) imposing a fine on the outfit for missing the race. Following the failure of these negotiations, he then announced that Shannon's deal had fallen through and that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> charge of the team. He hoped to finalise some more sponsorship deals which would allow Forti to compete in the Hungarian GP. Shannon responded by claiming it still owned 51% of the team, and that it intended to solve Forti's financial problems itself, in addition to replacing Guido Forti as Team Principal. He duly took the company to court over the matter, an arduous process in the Italian legal system.|$|E

King Edward's financial obligations were never paid in full during the earl's lifetime, and at Salisbury' death the king owed him £11,720. Of this, some £6374 were written off by his executors in 1346.|$|E
