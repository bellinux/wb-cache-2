Patients and Methods: The patients who had persistent or recrudescent <b>fever</b> after <b>treatment</b> with IVIG were subsequently treated with low-dose oral MTX [10 mg/body surface area (BSA) ] once weekly. Results: Seventeen patients developed persistent or recrudescent <b>fever</b> after <b>treatment</b> of KD with IVIG and were consequently given MTX. The proportion of children with coronary artery lesions (CALs) was 76 %. The median value of maximum body temperatures decreased significantly within 24 hours of MTX therapy (38. 6 vs. 37. 0, p < 0. 001). The median CRP (Creactive protein) level was found to be significantly lower 1 week after administering the first dose of MTX (8. 9 mg/dL vs. 1. 2 mg/dL, p < 0. 001). The median duration of <b>fever</b> before MTX <b>treatment</b> was shorter in CALs (-) group than in CALs (+) group (7 days vs. 10 days, p = 0. 023). No adverse effects of MTX were observed.

25|$|<b>Fever</b> during <b>treatment</b> can {{be due to}} {{a number}} of causes. It can occur as a natural effect of {{tuberculosis}} (in which case it should resolve within three weeks of starting <b>treatment).</b> <b>Fever</b> can be a result of drug resistance (but in that case the organism must be resistant to two or more of the drugs). Fever may {{be due to a}} superadded infection or additional diagnosis (patients with TB are not exempt from getting influenza and other illnesses during the course of treatment). In a few patients, the fever is due to drug allergy. The clinician must also consider the possibility that the diagnosis of TB is wrong. If the patient has been on treatment for more than two weeks and if the fever had initially settled and then come back, it is reasonable to stop all TB medication for 72 hours. If the fever persists despite stopping all TB medication, then the fever is not due to the drugs. If the <b>fever</b> disappears off <b>treatment,</b> then the drugs need to be tested individually to determine the cause. The same scheme as is used for test dosing for drug-induced hepatitis (described below) may be used.

5000|$|In dogs, these sacs are {{occasionally}} {{referred to}} as [...] "scent glands", because they enable the animals to mark their territory and identify other dogs. Most small dogs and many large ones too will need their anal sacs expressed at some stage of their lives. Anal sac expression should be performed to maintain the dog's hygiene, for instance if the fluid leaks spontaneously and to eliminate discomfort. Discomfort {{is evidenced by the}} dog dragging its posterior on the ground ("scooting"), licking or biting at the anus, sitting uncomfortably, having difficulty sitting or standing, or chasing its tail. In some dogs the sacs can spontaneously empty, especially under times of stress, and create a very sudden unpleasant change in the odor of the dog. Dog feces are normally firm, and the anal sacs usually empty when the dog defecates. When the dog's stools are soft they may not exert enough pressure on the glands, which then may fail to empty. This may cause discomfort as the full anal sac pushes on the anus. The sacs can be emptied by the dog's keeper, or by a groomer or veterinarian. The sacs are emptied by squeezing the sac so the contents are released through the small openings (ducts) {{on either side of the}} anus. This technique is known as [...] Discomfort may also be evident with impaction or infection of the anal glands. Anal sac impaction results from blockage of the duct leading from the gland to the opening. The sac is usually non-painful and swollen. Anal sac infection results in pain, swelling, and sometimes abscessation and <b>fever.</b> <b>Treatment</b> often involves frequent expression of the sac and systemic antibiotics. Occasionally treatment may include, lancing of an abscess or antibiotic infusion into the gland in the case of infection. The most common bacterial isolates from anal gland infection are E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens, and Proteus species.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Seeking {{treatment}} in formal healthcare for uncomplicated infections {{is vital to}} combating disease in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Healthcare treatment-seeking behaviour varies within and between communities and is modified by socio-economic, demographic, and physical factors. As a result, it remains a challenge to quantify healthcare treatment-seeking behaviour using a metric that is comparable across communities. Here, we present an application for transforming individual categorical responses (actions related to fever) to a continuous probabilistic estimate of <b>fever</b> <b>treatment</b> for one country in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Methods Using nationally representative household survey data from the 2013 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in Namibia, individual-level responses (n[*]=[*] 1138) were linked to theoretical estimates of travel time to the nearest public or private health facility. Bayesian Item Response Theory (IRT) models were fitted via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation to estimate parameters related to <b>fever</b> <b>treatment</b> and estimate probability of treatment for children under five years. Different models were implemented to evaluate computational needs {{and the effect of}} including predictor variables such as rurality. The mean treatment rates were then estimated at regional level. Results Modelling results suggested probability of <b>fever</b> <b>treatment</b> was highest in regions with relatively high incidence of malaria historically. The minimum predicted threshold probability of seeking treatment was 0. 3 (model 1 : 0. 340; 95 % CI 0. 155 – 0. 597), suggesting that even in populations at large distances from facilities, there was still a 30 % chance of an individual seeking treatment for fever. The agreement between correctly predicted probability of treatment at individual level based on a subset of data (n[*]=[*] 247) was high (AUC[*]=[*] 0. 978), with a sensitivity of 96. 7 % and a specificity of 75. 3 %. Conclusion We have shown how individual responses in national surveys can be transformed to probabilistic measures comparable at population level. Our analysis of household survey data on fever suggested a 30 % baseline threshold for <b>fever</b> <b>treatment</b> in Namibia. However, this threshold level is likely to vary by country or endemicity. Although our focus was on <b>fever</b> <b>treatment,</b> the methodology outlined can be extended to multiple health seeking behaviours captured in routine national survey data and to other infectious diseases...|$|E

Empirical data on utilization of health facilities is important to understanding geographic accessibility and defining health facility catchments at a national level.
