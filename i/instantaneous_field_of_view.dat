5000|$|The {{elementary}} (or effective) <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> (EFOV) {{is defined}} as the useful <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> at each scan position. Each such element consists of a 2×2 circular pixel matrix of what is called <b>instantaneous</b> <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> (IFOV). Each <b>of</b> the four pixels projected on the ground is circular and has a diameter of 12 km at nadir.

50|$|In remote sensing, {{the solid}} angle through which a {{detector}} element (a pixel sensor) {{is sensitive to}} electromagnetic radiation at any one time, is called <b>instantaneous</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> or IFOV. A measure of the spatial resolution of a remote sensing imaging system, it is often expressed as dimensions of visible ground area, for some known sensor altitude. Single pixel IFOV {{is closely related to}} concept of resolved pixel size, ground resolved distance, ground sample distance and modulation transfer function.|$|E
5000|$|This MSI imager uses a push-broom {{concept and}} its design {{has been driven}} by the large 290 km swath requirements, {{together}} with the high geometrical and spectral performance required of the measurements. It has a 150 mm aperture and a three-mirror anastigmat design with a focal length of about 600 mm; the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> is about 21 degrees by 3.5 degrees. [...] The mirrors are rectangular and made of silicon carbide, a similar technology to those on the Gaia mission.|$|E
50|$|The <b>instantaneous</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> (IFOV) is {{the area}} from which {{radiation}} currently impinges on the detector. The swath width is the distance, centered on the sensor path, from which signal will be captured in a single scan. Swath width {{is a function of}} the angular field of view (AFOV) of the scanning system. Most scanning sensors have an array of detectors such that the IFOV is the angle subtended by each detector and the AFOV is the total angle subtended by the array.|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} flying an earth observing mission using {{a group of}} {{observatories}} flying in formation, rather than a single observatory, is addressed. Contraints placed {{on the design of}} the observatories and of the mission, if it is required that the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> the two instruments overlap by a specified amount, are determined. The complexities of formation flying are found to greatly outweigh simpler solutions which combine instruments on a single spacecraft payload. While formation flying may be beneficial when crossing times and simultaneity arguments are not stringent, it is not practical for EOS. Accomplishment of the EOS scientific mission requires the simultaneous measurement of a basic set of earth system science parameters; it also requires that many events be observed by groups of instruments looking through the same atmospheric path...|$|R
50|$|More {{complex systems}} were used with digital processing, {{especially}} crossed-array and rosette seekers. These had such extremely narrow <b>instantaneous</b> <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> (IFOV) {{that they could}} be processed to produce an image, in the same fashion as a desktop scanner. By remembering the location of the target from scan to scan, objects moving at high speeds relative to the target could be eliminated. This is known as cinematic filtering. The same process is used by imaging systems, which image directly instead of scanning, and have the further capability of eliminating small targets by measuring their angular size directly.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} an imaging spectrometer, which is being studied as a {{potential}} Space Shuttle experiment, is evaluated as a 'push-broom' imager that includes a spectrometer to disperse each line of imaging information into its spectral components. Using this instrument, the dispersed energy falls upon a two-dimensional focal plane array that detects both spatial and spectral information. As the line <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> is advanced over the earth by {{the motion of the}} spacecraft, the focal plane is read out constantly, which produces 'push-broom' images at multiple wavelengths. Ground <b>instantaneous</b> <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> 10 m in the visual and 20 m in the infrared are provided by the system, at a spectral resolution of 20 nm over the range from 0. 4 - 2. 5 microns. The system utilizes a triple-pass Schmidt optical system with a mosaic focal plane. A subset of the data stream is selected and encoded for transmission by the use of onboard processing...|$|R

This wide field of view also enables HAWC to observe phenomena such as GRBs, which are rare, from unknown directions, and last only a few seconds. HAWC can thus discover new TeV sources and observe flaring in known sources that may have no low energy counterpart, i.e. orphan TeV flares from AGN that are signatures of hadronic acceleration.|$|E
50|$|Other {{companies}} also {{picked up on}} the work by Eletroacustic and designed their own scanning methods. AEG and Kepka of Vienna used systems with two movable plates that continually scanned horizontally or vertically, and determined the location of the target by timing when the image disappeared (AEG) or reappeared (Kepka). The Kepka Madrid system had an <b>instantaneous</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> (IFOV) of about 1.8 degrees and scanned a full 20 degree pattern. Combined with the movement of the entire seeker within the missile, it could track at angles as great as 100 degrees. Rheinmetall-Borsig and another team at AEG produced different variations on the spinning-disk system.|$|E
50|$|This {{situation}} {{leads to}} the use of a number of designs that use a relatively wide FOV to allow easy tracking, and then process the received signal in some way to gain additional accuracy for guidance. Generally the entire seeker assembly is mounted on a gimbal system that allows it to track the target through wide angles, and the angle between the seeker and the missile aircraft is used to produce guidance corrections. This gives rise the concepts of <b>instantaneous</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> (IFOV) which is the angle the detector sees, and the overall field of view, also known as the tacking angle or off-boresight capability, which includes the movement of the entire seeker assembly. Since the assembly cannot move instantly, a target moving rapidly across the missile's line of flight may be lost from the IFOV, which gives rise to the concept of a tracking rate, normally expressed in degrees per second.|$|E

The shuttle imaging spectrometer concept achieves 10 - and 20 -meter ground <b>instantaneous</b> <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> with 20 -nanometer spectral resolution from earth orbit. Onboard processing allows the selection of spectral bands during flight; this, in turn, permits the sensor parameters to be tailored to the experiment objectives.

5000|$|The Next-Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) is a {{ground-based}} robotic search for exoplanets. The facility {{is located at}} Paranal Observatory {{on the outskirts of}} the Atacama desert in northern Chile, a few kilometers from ESO's Very Large Telescope and near the VISTA Survey Telescope. Science operations began in early 2015. The astronomical survey is managed by a consortium of seven European universities and other academic institutions from Chile, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Prototypes of the array were tested in 2009 and 2010 on La Palma, and from 2012 to 2014 at Geneva Observatory. The aim of NGTS is to discover super-Earths and exo-Neptunes transiting relatively bright and nearby stars with an apparent magnitude of up to 13. The survey uses transit photometry, which precisely measures the dimming of a star to detect the presence of a planet when it crosses in front of it. NGTS consists of an array of twelve commercial 0.2-metre telescopes (f/2.8), each equipped with a red-sensitive CCD camera operating in the visible and near-infrared at 600-900 nm. The array covers an <b>instantaneous</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> of 96 square degrees (8 deg2 per telescope) or around 0.23% of the entire sky. NGTS builds heavily on the experience of its predecessor, SuperWASP, using more sensitive detectors, refined software, and improved optics. Compared to the Kepler spacecraft with its fixed field of view of 115 square degrees, the sky area covered by NGTS will be sixteen times larger, because the survey intends to scan four different fields every year over a period of four years. As a result, the number of discovered nearby exoplanets will be much larger.|$|E
5000|$|The HAWC Gamma-ray Observatory {{is a wide}} {{field of}} view, {{continuously}} operating, TeV gamma-ray telescope that explores the origin of cosmic rays, study the acceleration of particles in extreme physical environments, and search for new TeV physics. HAWC was built at an elevation of 4100 m above sea level in Mexico by a collaboration of 15 US and 12 Mexican institutions, and it is operated with funding from the US National Science Foundation, the US Department of Energy and CONACyT (Mexico’s science funding agency). HAWC was completed in spring of 2015, and consists of an array of 300 water Cherenkov detectors. It {{is designed to be}} more than an order of magnitude more sensitive than its predecessor, Milagro. [...] HAWC monitors the northern sky and makes coincident observations with other wide field of view observatories. HAWC overlap with observatories, such as VERITAS, HESS, MAGIC, IceCube and later, CTA, so they can make overlapping multi-wavelength and multi-messenger observations and to maximize coincident observations with the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi). HAWC has the ability to detect a large ensemble of gamma-ray sources - measuring their spectra and variability to characterize TeV scale acceleration mechanisms. In a one-year survey, HAWC can perform a deep, unbiased survey of the TeV gamma-ray with a 50 mCrab sensitivity at 5σ. HAWC will observe hard-spectrum (high photon energies) Galactic sources in the TeV with a sensitivity similar to that of Fermi in the GeV, detect diffuse emission from regions of the Galactic plane, have sensitivity to see known TeV active galactic nuclei and the brightest known GeV gamma-ray bursts, and represents a large enough step in sensitivity to likely discover new phenomena. Because HAWC has a 2 steradian <b>instantaneous</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> it will observe diffuse gamma-ray emission from the plane of the Galaxy over a broad range of Galactic longitudes reaching to the Galactic center.|$|E

Modest improvement in resolution is achieved for the 10. 65  GHz channels, albeit with slight ringing in the vicinity of coastlines and other sharp brightness temperature gradients. For all other channels, resolution is coarsened to approximate the 18. 7  GHz EFOV. It is shown that the resolution matching procedure reduces nonlinear correlations between channels in the presence of coastlines as well as enables the more efficient separation of large brightness temperature variations due to coastlines from the much smaller variations due to other geophysical variables.
