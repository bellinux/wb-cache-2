[...] Sepinwall expressed that Aniston [...] "acquits herself just fine in the small role of Jules eccentric new therapist. Shes likable and daffy but never over-the-top." [...] Hollywood Life journalist Laura Schreffler was not as enthusiastic as the general consensus, avouching that Anistons guest appearance was overhyped and a [...] "glorified cameo". Schreffler added that Cox overshadowed her, asserting that she [...] "is still way more hilarious".|$|R
