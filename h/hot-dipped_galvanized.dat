40|$|<b>Hot-dipped</b> <b>galvanized</b> steels {{are widely}} used in the {{automotive}} industry. The formability and damage resistance of zinc coatings depend strongly on their microstructure and adhesion to the steel substrate. In order to improve the mechanical performance of zinc coatings, the influence of their thickness, grain orientation and grain size on the zinc coating/steel substrate interface cracking behavior was studied. To this end, scanning electron microscopic observations during in situ tensile testing of zinc coated IF steel sheets were performed. After partial delamination of the zinc coating, cross sections of zinc coated steel were prepared to determine the location and extent of the interface cracking and the crystallographic orientation of the delaminated zinc grains. A two-grain model using a finite element method is proposed to analyze the zinc coating/steel substrate interface cracking behavior. In addition, the coating adhesion strength can be estimated based on this model. Both calculations and experimental observations show that: (i) a preferential zinc grain orientation with the [0001] direction parallel to the interface and (ii) a small grain size mitigate zinc coating/steel substrate interface cracking.

The material variations studied include zinc coating integrity, structure, composition, thickness, roughness, oil, and the amount and type of Fe-Zn intermetallics.

40|$|Buildings in Port Aransas {{encounter}} drastic environmental challenges: {{the potential}} catastrophic storm surge and high winds from a hurricane, and daily conditions hostile to buildings, vehicles, and even most vegetation. Its location {{a few hundred}} feet from the Gulf of Mexico and near-tropical latitude expose buildings to continuous high humidity, winds laden with scouring sand and corrosive salt, and extremes of temperature and ultraviolet light. Building construction methods are able to address each of these, but doing so in a sustainable way creates significant challenges. The new research building at the Marine Science Institute has been designed and is being constructed to meet the demand for both survivability and sustainability. It is tracking towards formal certification as a LEED Gold structure while being robust and resistant to the harsh coastal environment. The effects of a hurricane are mitigated by elevating buildings and providing a windproof envelope. Ground-level enclosures are designed to be sacrificial and non-structural so they can wash or blow away without imposing damage on the upper portions of the building, and only non-critical functions and equipment will be supported within them. Design features that integrate survivability with sustainability include: orientation of building axis; integral shading from direct summer sunlight; light wells; photovoltaic arrays; collection of rainwater and air conditioning condensate for use in landscape irrigation; reduced impervious cover; xeriscaping and indigenous plants; recycling of waste heat from air conditioning systems; roofing system that reflects light and heat; long life, low maintenance stainless steel, high-tensile vinyl, hard-anodized aluminum and <b>hot-dipped</b> <b>galvanized</b> mountings throughout; chloride-resistant concrete; reduced visual impact; recycling of construction materials. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{thermoplastic}} adhesive bonding process {{was developed for}} galvanized steel to polypropylene (PP) composite using a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) based adhesive with a total process cycle of less than 120 seconds. The processing temperature significantly affected the strength of adhesive bonded lap joints. Cataplasma and cyclic moisture/temperature aging tests demonstrated that the <b>hot-dipped</b> <b>galvanized</b> steel with a polyester melamine based primer did not improve the joint durability of galvanized steel to PP composite bonded with this HDPE based adhesive. The significant loss in the adhesion of the primer to galvanized steel under Cataplasma environment {{was due to the}} blistering of the primer. The blistering was essentially a process of the cathodic disbondment. ^ The fracture performance of HDPE based adhesive bonded double cantilever beam (DCB) aluminum joints was investigated. The fracture toughness, 1. 77 kJ/m 2, of the joints with a bondline thickness of 0. 2 mm at a testing crosshead speed of 5. 08 mm/minute, derived from beam theory equation, was significantly different from fracture toughness, 2. 54 kJ/m 2, obtained by cohesive zone model (CZM) approach, in which Needleman 2 ̆ 7 s modified exponential traction-separation law was employed. The large amount of deformation occurring in adhesive ahead of the crack tip significantly contributes the fracture toughness of joints. A modified equation was proposed to compute the fracture toughness of the adhesive bonded DCB joints. ^ The mechanical properties of the adhesive bonded DCB joints are strongly rate-dependent due to the viscoelasticity of the adhesive layer. A new rate-dependent cohesive zone model was developed to analyze the rate-dependent fracture behavior. The model consists of a rate-independent cohesive zone model in parallel to a Maxwell element. The numerical simulations were in good agreement with the experimental data for various testing crosshead speeds and for a relaxation test. A generalized rate-dependent CZM was suggested. ...|$|E
40|$|De-icing/anti-icing salts {{used during}} the winter season are the major culprit in {{limiting}} the durability of reinforced concrete structures. The salts induce corrosion of rebar, by penetrating the concrete and breaking down the protective film formed on the steel in the high alkaline environment of the concrete. Since the corrosion products occupy a volume larger {{than that of the}} corroded steel, they crack the concrete. The use of more corrosion resistant alloys is one method of improving the durability of reinforced concrete structures. Conventional <b>hot-dipped</b> <b>galvanized</b> steel (HDG) is an economical alternative to black steel mainly because: the zinc coating has a higher chloride threshold and, when the bar eventually corrodes, it provides additional protection to the base steel through its sacrificial anode effect, its corrosion products are soluble and do not crack the concrete, and it forms a stable protective film even in low pH concrete. However, its major drawback is the brittle and less corrosion resistant (than pure Zn) Fe-Zn intermetallic compounds (IMC) formed in the coating. To remedy this, a ductile pure zinc coating produced by a continuously galvanizing process has recently been developed. Small amounts of aluminum are added to the zinc bath with the goal of forming an Fe-Al inhibition layer between the steel and the zinc coating. In this project, three prototypes of the continuously galvanized rebar (CGR) grades, C 1, C 2 and C 3 were electrochemically assessed, using galvanostatic pulse (GP) and linear polarization resistance (LPR) techniques, to evaluate and compare the corrosion behaviour of these bars against HDG and black steel. A second goal of the project was to identify the characteristic electrochemical potentials of HDG steel and CGR coatings to provide similar guidelines to those provided by ASTM C 876 for assessing the probability of corrosion of uncoated carbon steel rebar in the field. All bars were cast in both non-cracked and cracked concrete, and exposed to a multi-chloride brine solution locally available and used across Ontario, Canada. Metallographic examination performed on the galvanized bars showed the non-uniformity of all coatings, particularly the CGR grades - some regions which were significantly less than the specified thickness, and some others were too thin to be detected. The coating thickness on the tested HDG, C 1 and C 2, and C 3 bars were in the range of 105 – 250 µm, 15 – 60 µm, 5 – 33 µm respectively. The aluminum content of the C 3 bars, ~ 9 %, was similar in range to “Galfan” steel. After weekly electrochemical testing for 64 weeks, the results showed that the C 3 performed the same as black steel in both passive and active state. The C 1 and C 2 bars performed the same as HDG bars in the passive state and three to five times better than black steel in the active state. The HDG bars exhibited ten times better “corrosion performance” than black steel in both passive and active state. The time to corrosion initiation was not determined in the present project, as a result, “corrosion performance” is defined as the active corrosion rate after initiation. The electrochemical behaviour of galvanized bars has been attributed to their zinc thickness and/or the presence of significant aluminum content in the coatings. The corrosion product of the high Al containing bar, C 3, appeared to affect the bonding between the bar and its concrete, which then negatively affected the electrochemical behaviour of the bar. To characterize the corrosion potentials of these galvanized bars, the passive and active corrosion potential values of all galvanized bars were in the range of - 266 to - 382 mV vs SCE and - 345 to - 686 mV vs SCE, respectively. Moreover, the HDG and C 3 rebar grades are in the upper and lower end of the ranges, respectively. The potential guideline developed for accessing probability of corrosion of black steel in concrete suggests that when the potential is more positive than - 335 mV vs SCE (or - 410 mV CSE), there is low probability of corrosion, when it is more negative than - 385 mV vs SCE (or 460 mV vs CSE), there is high probability of corrosion, and an uncertain region exists between these potentials...|$|E
