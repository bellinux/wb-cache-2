40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{propose the}} Trial-Based Thought Record, a modified, 7 -column thought record {{addressing}} core beliefs by sentence reversion and the analogy to a trial. METHOD: Clients (n = 30) {{participated in a}} simulation of a trial and exhibited shifts in their adherence to core beliefs and in the intensity of corresponding emotions after each step (investigation, prosecutor <b>s</b> <b>plea,</b> defense attorney <b>s</b> <b>plea,</b> prosecutor <b>s</b> second <b>plea,</b> defense attorney <b>s</b> second <b>plea,</b> and jury verdict) during a session. RESULTS: Significant mean reductions existed between percent values after investigation (taken as baseline) and defense attorney <b>s</b> <b>plea</b> (p < 0. 001), and after the jury s verdict, either in beliefs (p < 0. 001) or in intensity of emotions (p < 0. 001). Significant differences also emerged between the defense attorney s first and second pleas (p = 0. 009) and between the defense attorney <b>s</b> second <b>plea</b> and jury <b>s</b> verdict concerning core beliefs (p = 0. 005) and emotions (p = 0. 02). CONCLUSION: Trial-Based Thought Record may at least temporarily help patients constructively reduce attachment to negative core beliefs and corresponding emotions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new method to measure health inequalities that {{are caused by}} {{conditions}} amenable to policy intervention. The method is built on a technique that can separate avoidable and unavoidable mortality risks, using world mortality data compiled by the World Health Organization for the year 2000. The new method is applied to data from 191 countries. It is found that controlling for unavoidable mortality risks leads to a lower estimate of health inequality than otherwise, especially for developed countries. Furthermore, although countries with a higher life expectancy at birth tend to have lower health inequality, there are significant variations in health inequalities across countries with the same life expectancy.

40|$|When {{considering}} the defendant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>plea,</b> barristers, like lawyers, have two overriding, selfish interests: maximizing remuneration and avoiding sanction. The tension between defendant and defender is most acute when {{the defendant is}} indigent and the defender has been chosen to represent him. It is their relationship that is addressed in this article. The goal is to align the defender 2 ̆ 7 s selfish interests with the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s need for thoughtful advice over how to plead, so that, behind the guise of apparently disinterested advice, the advocate is not pursuing his interests at the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s expense. By contrast to most American practice, the method of compensating barristers, together {{with the threat of}} sanction for misbehavior, actually inclines barristers to prefer a trial over a guilty plea. As a result, when recommending a guilty plea, the barrister is arguably trying to protect the defendant because he acts against his self-interest in doing so. Could American jurisdictions borrow from English practice, so that the lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s interests are more coextensive with the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s when {{considering the}} defendant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>plea?</b> The answer is in general yes, even as the specifics of English arrangements defy adoption. This article addresses the barrister 2 ̆ 7 s and lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s interests in Parts I and IV; however, it begins in Part I by explaining the barrister 2 ̆ 7 s relationship with the defendant. In doing so it uncovers the tension between the interests of each and indicates how, and how not, that tension is resolved to align their interests. Part II of this article considers the erroneous reasons why critics believe barristers ignore the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s interests to pursue their own. In conclusion, Part V considers lessons the American criminal system can learn from England about how to align the lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s interests with those of the defendant.

France, Germany, and Belgium, concerned that such a move by NATO would send a message that war with Iraq was inevitable, resisted the request. In response, Turkey, the only member of NATO that shares a border with Iraq, pressed the issue by invoking Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which provides that 2 ̆ 2 [t]he Parties will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened. 2 ̆ 2 Despite Turkey 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>plea</b> for collective defense, which is the purpose of NATO, France and the others continued to block any planning for almost a month.

Thrown in a van {{on the streets of}} Milan, the abduction took Abu Omar from Italy to Egypt, where he was allegedly tortured and interrogated about his role in recruiting fighters for extremist Islamic causes, including the insurgency in Iraq. This essay posits that lost amidst politically charged rhetoric about Bush administration impunity and the “war on terror” is that the Italian Court did not have jurisdiction over the USAF officer and violated the human rights of the other U. <b>S.</b> <b>defendants.</b> None of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>defendants</b> were at the proceedings. Although the Italian government refused to forward extradition requests from the Italian prosecutor to the U. S. government, Italian law allows for in absentia trials. Two Americans secured private counsel, the remaining U. <b>S.</b> <b>defendants</b> were solely represented by court-appointed Italian attorneys, none of whom ever spoke with their clients. Regardless of whether what happened to Abu Omar is considered an extraordinary rendition or state enabled kidnapping, the Italian proceedings should provide little comfort to those truly interested in {{the rule of law and}} human rights. Rather than supporting the rule of law, the Italian trial blatantly disregarded international law and treaty and the conduct of the in absentia proceedings simply followed one alleged human rights abuse with another.

40|$|Contemporary {{death penalty}} law is deeply conflicted. The basic {{procedural}} and jurisprudential structures - the foundational principle of 2 ̆ 2 individual consideration, 2 ̆ 2 the open-ended evidentiary rules that govern sentencing processes, and the procedural devices by which that unbounded evidence is evaluated - all originated as {{the offspring of}} an explicitly non-retributive penal theory crafted {{in large part by}} Herbert Wechsler and codified in the Model Penal Code. The Court 2 ̆ 7 s understanding of the purposes served by the death penalty, however, has increasingly been informed by retributive principles. Currently, the American Law Institute is undertaking a fundamental revision of the Code 2 ̆ 7 s sentencing provisions to reflect the resurgence of retributivism in contemporary penal discourse. In this Article, the author argues that because the Court has continued to sanction the procedural structures outlined by the MPC - structures which reflect the non-retributive theoretical underpinnings of the Code - contemporary sentencing procedures fail to serve the predominantly retributive role that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s understanding of the death penalty indicates they should play. Thus, the capital sentencing procedures outlined in the Code, implemented by numerous states, and sanctioned by the Court, must also be subjected to a new, and searching, scrutiny. The author suggests that a retributive approach to capital sentencing procedure would diverge from the current utilitarian, offender-based model in three important respects. First, the evidentiary universe upon which sentencing decisions are made would be more tightly circumscribed to ensure that the sentencing decision is grounded on appropriate retributive considerations: the harm caused by the offender and his personal culpability. Second, the mitigation and aggravation components of the sentencing inquiry would be disentangled, and the weighing paradigm reflected in the MPC would be abandoned. Third, in recrafting the penalty phase, arguments in mitigation would be conceptually disaggregated from pleas for mercy. Under such a regime, 2 ̆ 2 bad character 2 ̆ 2 evidence that now routinely is admitted at penalty phase proceedings would instead only be admissible to rebut a defendant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>plea</b> for mercy. By shifting the focus of capital sentencing from the character of the offender {{to the nature of the}} offense the predominant retributive goal: ensuring that only the most morally blameworthy defendants are subject to the most severe penal sanction, would better be achieved...|$|R

Nonetheless it concludes that charge bargaining is likely here to stay and offers recommendations for making charge bargaining more compatible with the unique functions of international justice...|$|R
