The high speed gas sampling valve mounted on the engine cylinder {{was connected to the}} gas chromatograph instrument directly, and samplings were continuously gathered at the intended crank shaft angle ranges. The electro-magnetic valve lift time was controlled by setting a time-lag from the TDC reference point of the engine crank angle. Crank pulses were provided by crank pulse generator.

40|$|Several {{initiatives}} are currently emerging {{to observe the}} exchange of energy and matter between the earth's surface and atmosphere standardized over larger space and time domains. For example, the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and the Integrated Carbon Observing System (ICOS) are set to provide the ability of unbiased ecological inference across ecoclimatic zones and decades by deploying highly scalable and robust instruments and data processing. In the construction of these observatories, enclosed infrared gas analyzers are widely employed for eddy covariance applications. While these sensors represent a substantial improvement compared to their open- and closed-path predecessors, remaining high-frequency attenuation varies with site properties and gas sampling systems, and requires correction. Here, we show that components of the <b>gas</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>system</b> can substantially contribute to such high-frequency attenuation, but their effects can be significantly reduced by careful system design. From laboratory tests we determine the frequency at which signal attenuation reaches 50  % for individual parts of the <b>gas</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>system.</b> For different models of rain caps and particulate filters, this frequency falls into ranges of 2. 5 – 16. 5  Hz for CO 2, 2. 4 – 14. 3  Hz for H 2 O, and 8. 3 – 21. 8  Hz for CO 2, 1. 4 – 19. 9  Hz for H 2 O, respectively. A short and thin stainless steel intake tube was found to not limit frequency response, with 50  % attenuation occurring at frequencies well above 10  Hz for both H 2 O and CO 2. From field tests we found that heating the intake tube and particulate filter continuously with 4  W was effective, and reduced the occurrence of problematic relative humidity levels (RH [*]>[*] 60  %) by 50  % in the infrared gas analyzer cell. No further improvement of H 2 O frequency response was found for heating in excess of 4  W. These laboratory and field tests were reconciled using resistor–capacitor theory, and NEON's final <b>gas</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>system</b> was developed on this basis. The design consists of the stainless steel intake tube, a pleated mesh particulate filter and a low-volume rain cap in combination with 4  W of heating and insulation. In comparison to the original design, this reduced the high-frequency attenuation for H 2 O by [*]≈[*] 3 ∕ 4, and the remaining cospectral correction did not exceed 3  %, even at high relative humidity (95  %). The standardized design can be used across a wide range of ecoclimates and site layouts, and maximizes practicability due to minimal flow resistance and maintenance needs. Furthermore, due to minimal high-frequency spectral loss, it supports the routine application of adaptive correction procedures, and enables largely automated data processing across sites...|$|E

40|$|Titan {{is unique}} in the solar system, the only moon that has a dense atmosphere. The major {{constituents}} of the atmosphere, nitrogen and methane, are continuously broken apart {{by a combination of}} solar UV, impinging electrons from Saturn s magnetosphere, and a steady flux of cosmic rays. The resulting molecular fragments recombine and form a variety of new species, many of which were detected for the first time by Voyager 1. The ubiquitous, surface- hiding aerosol blanket manifests the existence of still more complex compounds. In addition to hydrocarbons and nitriles, the atmosphere is known to contain CO, CO 2 and externally delivered H 2 O. The Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer (GCMS) on the Huygens Probe will measure the chemical composition of the atmosphere of Titan from 170 Km altitude (approximately 1 hPa) to the surface (approximately 1500 hPa) and determine the isotope ratios of the major constituents. The GCMS will also analyze gas samples from the Aerosol Collector Pyrolyser (ACP) and may be able to obtain compositional information of several surface materials.

40|$|Small-scale spatial {{variability}} in soil carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) fluxes poses serious {{challenges to the}} experimental design, and number of <b>gas</b> <b>samples</b> needed to provide a reliable estimate of flux usually exceeds analytical capacities. We pooled <b>gas</b> <b>samples</b> –analogously to soil pooling – to overcome this challenge. Our sample pooling technique collects a composite <b>gas</b> <b>sample</b> from several chambers instead of the conventional practise of analyzing samples from chambers individually, thus reducing numbers of <b>gas</b> <b>samples.</b> The method was verified to be reasonably accurate in forest, grassland and agricultural fields over a four week measurement campaign. Pooling technique results differed by 2 – 8 % for CO 2 and by 3 – 4 % for N 2 O when compared to individual chamber means. That shows pooling of <b>gas</b> <b>samples</b> across individual static chambers is an acceptable approach to integrate spatial heterogeneity...|$|R
