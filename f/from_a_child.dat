5|$|Tsarina Alexandra chose Maria to {{accompany}} Tsar Nicholas II and herself to Yekaterinburg {{when the family}} was briefly separated in April 1918. Maria had grown <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> to a woman {{during the years of}} captivity, according to the Baroness Sophie Buxhoevden, a lady in waiting, and the Tsarina felt she could depend upon her third daughter to help her as she could not rely upon the deeply depressed Olga or Anastasia, who was still a child. Level-headed Tatiana was needed to watch over her ill brother. They were forced to leave their other children behind in Tobolsk because Maria's brother Alexei was ill. The four other children joined their family in Yekaterinburg several weeks later.|$|E
5|$|Later, Howard {{arrives at}} Mickey's Diner and uses their {{phone to call}} home. As {{he tried to get}} a hold of Liz, he unintentionally scolds Jamie on the phone over Turbo-Man. Jamie, in turn, rebukes his father about how he never keeps his promises, and hangs up. Liz overhears the {{argument}} and becomes disappointed in her husband. Howard then encounters Myron at the diner. As they sat down and talk, Myron tells Howard about the time when his father was unable to get him a Johnny Seven OMA toy on Christmas. They hear on the KQRS radio station that the D.J. is running a Turbo-Man competition. When they get to the studio, they find out they can only win a gift certificate. They are nearly arrested, but Myron bluffs the police into backing off by threatening them with a package (which he claims is a mail bomb, unaware that it really is one). Officer Hummell tries to open it and it blows up in his face. After his car is stripped by thieves, Howard is ultimately forced to return home empty-handed. Upon seeing Ted in his house placing the star on his tree, Howard gets angry and attempts to steal the Turbo-Man doll from Ted's house that he had bought for his son Johnny (E.J. De La Pena), but changes his mind at the last moment as he could not see himself stealing <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> He is attacked by Ted's pet reindeer but manages to lock him up but he unintentionally sets some of his stuff on fire he tires to put it out but kicks it outside the window. This commotion leads him to be caught by Ted and a distraught Liz. Liz and Jamie leave for the local Wintertainment Parade with Ted and Johnny; Howard follows, aiming to make amends. At the parade, Ted makes a pass at Liz, but after seeing what he really is, she turns him down by hitting him with a thermos of eggnog.|$|E

40|$|Background Due {{to limited}} {{information}} on sugar drink counseling, characteristics {{of parents who}} reported ever receiving counseling <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>child’s</b> doctor to limit <b>a</b> <b>child’s</b> sugar drink intake were examined. Methods This cross-sectional analysis was conducted on a convenient sample of 1570 US parents (aged 18 years) using the 2009 HealthStyles Survey. The outcome measure was parents with children aged 18 years who reported being told by <b>a</b> <b>child’s</b> doctor to limit <b>a</b> <b>child’s</b> sugar drink intake. Data were weighted to provide national estimates. Multivariable logistic regression {{was used to examine}} factors associated with ever receiving sugar-drink counseling <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>child’s</b> doctor.

25|$|The Bouverie Centre (first {{known as}} the Collins Street Clinic) was {{established}} as a clinical mental health service for children and adolescents. In 1956, the centre was renamed the Bouverie Clinic following its relocation from Collins Street, in the CBD of Melbourne to Bouverie Street, Carlton. The Bouverie Centre made the transition <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> psychiatric clinic to the first family therapy centre in Australia in the mid 1970s. In 2007 the Bouverie Centre moved into a $5 million, state government funded, purpose built building at 8 Gardiner Street, Brunswick.|$|E

25|$|In {{the initial}} excavation, two large hearths were found and many small ones as well. The remains of local animals were found, in {{addition}} to wooden posts from approximately twelve huts. Scraps of clothing made of hide were also found. This led archaeologists to estimate the population was around 20-30 inhabitants. A human footprint was {{also found in the}} clay, probably <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> Inside the camp, archaeologists found a chunk of meat that still had preserved DNA. After a DNA analysis, it matched that of a gomphothere, indicating the type of food the inhabitants ate.|$|E
25|$|Adult Nursing Relationship (ANR): The {{suckling}} of {{milk from}} a female's breast {{on a regular}} basis from one or more partner(s). Successful ANRs depend on a stable and long-term relationship, as otherwise {{it is very difficult to}} maintain a steady milk flow. Couples may begin an ANR by transferring regular suckling <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> to a sexual partner (e.g. spouse). Such a relationship may form as an expression of close intimacy and mutual tenderness, and may even exist without sex. Breastfeeding can have a strong stabilizing effect on the partnership. The breastfeeding woman may experience orgasms or a pleasurable let-down reflex.|$|E
25|$|Today {{tourists}} {{see only}} the sculpted figurines of this clock, but behind this ensemble there is a mechanism that engages and that {{represents one of the}} most beautiful curiosities of the cathedral. The animated characters launch into movement at different hours of the day. One angel sounds the bell while a second turns over an hourglass. Different characters, representing the ages of life (<b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> to an old man) parade in front of Death. On the last level are the Apostles, passing in front of Christ. The clock shows much more than the official time; it also indicates solar time, the day of the week (each represented by a god of mythology), the month, the year, the sign of the zodiac, the phase of the moon and the position of several planets. All these automatons are put into operation at 12:30 PM.|$|E

Out of an estimated number of 5,000 escapees, a total of 239 people died while trying to cross the Berlin Wall.|$|E
500|$|Prior to acting, LaBeouf practiced comedy {{around his}} {{neighborhood}} as an [...] "escape" [...] from a hostile environment.

[...] He subsequently found an agent through the Yellow Pages {{and was taken}} on after pretending to be his own manager. LaBeouf {{has said that he}} initially became an actor because his family was broke, not because he wanted to pursue an acting career, having originally gotten the idea <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> actor he met who had things he wanted.|$|E

500|$|Welles used an aural {{technique}} {{from radio}} called the [...] "lightning-mix". Welles used this technique to link complex montage sequences via {{a series of}} related sounds or phrases. For example, Kane grows <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> into {{a young man in}} just two shots. As Thatcher hands eight-year-old Kane a sled and wishes him a Merry Christmas, the sequence suddenly jumps to a shot of Thatcher fifteen years later, completing the sentence he began in both the previous shot and the chronological past. Other radio techniques include using a number of voices, each saying a sentence or sometimes merely a fragment of a sentence, and splicing the dialogue together in quick succession, such as the projection room scene. The film's sound cost $16,996, but was originally budgeted at $7,288.|$|E
500|$|Fusanosuke Natsume {{says that}} the theme of {{disaster}} and growth in the manga is a reference to [...] "post-War Japanese manga" [...] that Osamu Tezuka began in the mid 1940s. He also comments that {{the violence in the}} manga has context that children can understand, and is not just there at random. While Toriyama has said that Journey to the West was an influence on the manga, Xavier Mínguez-López comments that it is a parody of the Chinese novel, since the stories are similar. He notes that Toriyama uses Chinese mythology and Japanese folktales, the dragon Shenlong who is summoned from the Dragon Balls, as well as characters who are able to come back to life as examples of similarities. Rachel Cantrell {{says that the}} manga parodies martial arts very well, and mentions how Toriyama uses panels to a full extent. She notes that the manga has a coming-of-age theme due to how the story captures Goku <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> to an adult.|$|E

2500|$|The unnamed fireteam {{comprised}} three Spartans: [...] "Smith", [...] "Jones", and [...] "Brown". Initially, none {{of these}} characters' traits—not even their genders—were determined.

Brian Reed recalled {{that at one point}} they had added Fireteam Majestic member Thorne, as well as Spartan leader Palmer, and a still-unnamed Jones, who would be an expert in alien languages. Spartan Jones turned into Spartan Vesper, and her character matured <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> prodigy to someone more serious, if innocent.|$|E
2500|$|When the DVD was released, Monsters and Critics {{said of the}} season, [...] "The {{second season}} of Body of Proof takes what worked with the first season and {{continues}} {{to build on the}} premise. The series still feels formulaic to me, but the cast make it worth taking the time to watch and help it overcome any short comings. The second season sees more medical mysteries and twist with each episode as Dr. Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and her team are back to handle everything <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> kidnapping to a murder where the entire city could be suspect. Along with murder and other crimes, the team deals with a new romance and Hunt continues to work around strained relationships with her ex-husband and boss. The series still feels formulaic and doesn't quite fire on all cylinders for me, but season two was an improvement. The series leaves you wanting to see what will happen in season three.|$|E
