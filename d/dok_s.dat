Afirmirano pričanje o nadnaravnim bićima pokazuje povijesnu, političku i etničku koherentnost lokalnih skupina <b>dok,</b> <b>s</b> druge strane, negiranje, racionaliziranje i autocenzura kazivača upućuje na pripadnike skupina koje žive na etnički i politički slojevitom području nakon Domovinskoga rata. Recent field {{research}} {{of belief in}} supernatural beings in Dalmatia 2 ̆ 7 s hinterland suggests that the research of belief in fairies, witches, moras and werewolves can offer some general insights into local belonging of certain population groups. This paper focuses on two such groups and their attitude toward believing in supernatural beings. The first groups is composed of informants from the Dalmatinska Zagora region who emphasize their own knowledge of the legends about supernatural beings and frequently witness and interpret personal experience and encounters with fairies, moras, witches and werewolves. The accounts attempt to reconstruct collective memories. Each of the informants tries to add something to the initial story, tries to remember additional elements to complete it, in order to underline their belonging to the tradition of their village. The knowledge of information, details, the stressing of one 2 ̆ 7 s own involvement in the encounter with supernatural beings makes them qualified {{members of the local}} community. On the other hand, a group of informants from Bukovica, although evidently privy to the researched topic, is almost always inclined towards negation, self-censorship and rationalizing when it comes to believing in supernatural beings. Unlike Dalmatinska Zagora, where informants identify the knowledge of and telling stories about supernatural beings as part of their tradition and as a symbol of local belonging, primarily due to the homogeneousness of their group or region, the people from Bukovica, whether ethnic Serbs or Croats, consider these beliefs and stories as something “forbidden” or at least not recommended. In other words, the inhabitants of Bukovica are prone to negation, self-censorship and rationalizing when it comes to supernatural beings because, in their attempts at achieving a peaceful coexistence, {{they do not want to}} compromise themselves as backward or primitive Croatian or Serbian returning refugees, thus avoiding the negative image in the eyes of the “intellectual” elite...|$|E

U prvome dijelu, polazeći od povijesti feminizma, autor prati mijenjanje slike žene u svakoj od pojedinih faza. Posebno se osvrće na problematiku tumačenja naravi i kulture, roda i spola, u drugome i trećem valu feminizma u kojima je pod utjecajima postmoderne i rodne teorije došlo do dekonstrukcije naravne slike žene. Naime, <b>dok</b> <b>s</b> jedne strane postmoderni feminizam (postfeminizam) dovodi u pitanje postojanja kategorije žene kao takve ističući da ne postoji žena (ut sic) nego postoji kategorija ženā (bjelkinje, crnkinje, lezbijke, heteroseksualne itd.), s druge strane, rodna teorija kategoriju žene smatra proizvodom kulture. U drugome dijelu rada, autor prema novijoj katoličkoj biblijsko–teološkoj antropologiji Ivana Pavla II. i Benedikta XVI. tumači naravnu sliku žene. Na kraju, imajući u vidu sliku žene prema »staromu feminizmu«, kao i utjecaj rodne teorije na naravnu sliku žene, autor u novome feminizmu vidi mogući put ne samo u očuvanju naravne slike žene, nego i mogućnost stvaranja drugačije kulture, kulture u kojoj žena ne bi bila diskriminirana. In {{the article}} the author {{deals with the}} {{phenomenon}} of feminism {{and the image of}} women portrayed by feminism through its historical phases. In the first section, starting from the history of feminism and its various phases, the author traces the changes in the image of women in each individual phase. The author makes a special reference to the problem of interpretation of nature and culture, gender and sexuality {{in the second and third}} waves of feminism in which, under the influence of postmodernism and the gender theory, there came about a deconstruction of the natural image of women. Namely, while on the one hand postmodern feminism (post–feminism) questions the existence of the category »woman« as such, emphasizing that »woman« does not exist (ut sic), but rather only a category of women (white, black, lesbian, heterosexual, etc.), on the other hand the gender theory considers the category »woman« a product of culture. In the second section of the essay the author explains the natural image of women according to the more recent Catholic bibilical–theological anthropology of John Paul II and Benedict XVI. Taking into account the image of women from the aspect of »the old feminism«, and the influence of the gender theory on the natural image of women, the author sees in the new feminism a possible means not only of preserving the natural image of women, but also the possibilty of creating a different culture, a culture in which women would not be discriminated...|$|E

Istraživanje se temelji na pretpostavci o međusobnoj povezanosti procesa izgradnje turističke destinacije, medijske reprezentacije kulturne baštine te diskursne konstrukcije kulturnoga identiteta. Identitet se shvaća antropološki i konstrukcionistčki, kao rezultat simboličkoga procesa identifikacije, pri čemu kulturna baština ima ulogu ključnoga disursnog sredstva artikulacije nacionalne kulture. Analiza obuhvaća internetske stranice Hrvatske turističke zajednice te uzorak od trideset i pet lokalnih turističkih zajednica. Prvi dio empirijske analize odnosi se na tipološke karakteristike reprezentirane kulturne baštine, drugi se fokusira na analizu porijekla reprezentirane baštine i s njom povezanoga procesa kulturne identifikacije, dok se posljednji dio bavi medijskim aspektima reprezentacije kulturne baštine u „novome“ mediju internetskih stranica. Rezultati pokazuju snažne selekcijske procese u reprezentaciji kulturne baštine, koji se mogu pripisati ideološkim potrebama nove nacionalne države za izgradnjom vlastitoga nacionalnog identiteta artikulacijom kulturne sličnosti sa Srednjom Europom, „Zapadom“ i Mediteranom, s istodobnom negativnom identifikacijom s Balkanom, „Istokom“ i socijalističkim odnosno komunističkim naslijeđem. Takvi se rezultati s jedne strane uklapaju u suvremene kritičke teorije kulturne baštine koje je smatraju proizvodom tradicije europskoga nacionalizma i msredstvom diskursne konstrukcije jedinstvene nacionalne kulture, <b>dok</b> <b>s</b> druge strane pokazuju određene specifičnosti uvjetovane posebnostima hrvatske nacionalne ideologije. Tourism {{has a very}} {{important}} role in the Croatian society, primarily as a source of income for the central government and many local communities. However, it is also important as a cultural phenomenon in which host communities represent themselves to guests and thereby advertise what they consider important for their cultural identity. Cultural heritage has a central role in this process because it is inextricably connected both with tourism, as a symbolic resource for tourist branding and creating an image of a tourist destination, and as a socially prestigious expression of cultural identity. According to the recent theoretical approaches to cultural heritage, heritage is primarily a type of social discourse which aims to naturalise the connection between certain types of heritage and specific cultural values. Stemming from the 19 th century nationalist ideology of the European bourgeois, cultural heritage is especially seen as an expression of national cultural identity, which is itself constructed through discursive agency, including that of media representations. In order to legitimise a nation as a political and cultural entity, such discourses are aimed at reducing the intranational differences {{and at the same time}} emphasizing the differences between itself and other nations. However, the latter process only takes place in case of nations which are seen as the cultural “Other”, which the nation is striving to discern itself from, while nations and cultures which are recognised as being culturally similar are generally identified with in positive terms. The sample consists of the website of the national tourist board (Hrvatska turistička zajednica – Croatian Tourist Board) as well as the websites of 35 local tourist boards. The analysis itself consists of three main parts. The first is aimed at analysing typologicalcharacteristics of the represented cultural heritage in the sample. The second deals with its origins and the explicit and implicit expression of cultural identification. The final part is a media analysis of the websites in the sample, focusing on the way they are used as a globally popular “new” medium. Empirical results indicate that the representation of cultural heritage in the sample reflects selection strategies, which are driven by purposes other than pure economical ones. Although the context of tourist promotion would indicate a widespread use of cultural heritage as a form of symbolic capital which is in tourism turned into financial capital, results show that heritage resources are not used to their full potential, with the selection strategies favouring those heritage elements which are directly connected with the dominant national discourse of Croatia as a part of the Mediterranean, Central European, Catholic and “Western” cultural circles, with a corresponding negative identification with the Balkan,communist and “Eastern” cultures. This fundamental discursive structure reflects the dominant national myth of Croatia as the bulwark (or antemurale) of Christianity and Europeanness, against the inferior eastern cultures, which are seen as a threat to the unquestionable cultural values of the Western European civilisation. These results by and large confirm the results of previous research on cultural representations in printed tourist brochures in the 2000 s (see Rivera 2005 and 2008). However, unlike previous research, which indicated very explicit and verbal cultural identification processes, our results show that the new official narrative of the nation is less explicit in expressing cultural values in terms of the superiority of the Western culture(s) and inferiority of the “East”. This narrative is more heavily coded, using semiotic resources of heritage to express some of the same ideas that were previously expressed in a more direct manner. However, it may be said that the additional level of cultural codes of heritage does not “dull the blade” of the national discourse, but rather supports it through rich symbolism and, indirectly, through the work of the “authorized heritage discourse”. The Croatian heritage discourse thus “authorizes” those cultural elements of heritage that are seen as reflecting the country’s belonging to the Western(Christian and Catholic) European cultural sphere, and at the same time erasing the heritage ofother cultures (and even unwanted parts of the national past itself), thereby significantly reducing the cultural diversity of Croatian cultural heritage. At the same time, the media analysis, which was aimed at analysing the way key characteristics of the “new” media are used in the sample, has shown that just as heritage resources are subject to selection, so is the use of the medium. Only those of its possibilities are used which allow for an efficient communication of visual and textual data, i. e. digitalisation and networked communication,while others such as distribution of production and user participation are significantly neglected or even suppressed. As a result, the media messages are centrally produced and disseminated in a manner akin to the “old”, broadcast media. The purpose of this strategy is to maintain control over the processes of representation and the expression of cultural meanings of Croatian cultural heritage, thereby controlling one of the most powerful means of symbolic identity construction...|$|E

Tobacco and alcohol – sources of massive quantities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) – have been clearly identified as etiologic factors that contribute to these malignancies. Considering the role of glutathione (GSH) in ROS detoxification, we hypothesized that potential biological markers can be found in addition to the parameters of oxidative stress. In line with previous studies that emphasized the accumulation of GSH in tumor cells, in this study, we have reported a lower ratio of oxidized versus reduced GSH in head and neck tumors. Objective: The aim of the paper was to evaluate the prognostic and clinical significance of the ratio of oxidized versus reduced GSH in patients with head and neck cancers. Methods: Thirty-six patients with HNSCC were included in this study. The tumoral redox status was determined by measuring the ratio of oxidized/reduced GSH (GSSG/GSH) by capillary electrophoresis. Statistical analysis was performed to assess the correlation between patient, clinical factors and the redox status. Results: The results showed a low tumoral ratio of GSSG/GSH and a better locoregional control. Moreover, a significant correlation between the tumoral redox status ratio (GSSG/GSH) and nodal stage (N 0 versus N 1, N 2 and N 3) was also observed. A higher tumoral redox status ratio was found {{to be associated with the}} presence of lymph node metastasis (N 1, N 2 and N 3). Conclusion: A strong correlation was observed between the oxidative status and locoregional control of the tumors. Moreover, a higher basal tumoral redox status ratio was found to be correlated with the presence of lymph node metastasis.

Anticipatory eye {{movements}} are studied {{as a good}} psycholinguistic measure of argument structure processing. It is well documented that people tend to turn their gaze towards the reference of the noun when they listen to a sentence; however, when they hear a verb in a sentence, their gaze anticipates its arguments, i. e. the gaze is turned to the objects that are references of the verb’s arguments. Although {{there is no agreement}} {{on the nature of the}} processes that are reflected in the anticipatory gaze (whether they reflect syntactic processes of argument structure building or semantic processes related to the meaning of the verb), anticipatory eye movements correspond to the top–down processes in language processing. In this study we measured anticipatory eye movements in two groups of children: children with typical language development (TLD) and children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). In a listening paradigm the anticipatory gaze was recorded in two conditions: (1) with the last word of the sentence (part of the argument structure of the verb) represented as a picture and (2) with the last word of the sentence not represented on the screen. Instead, a picture that represents a semantically related word was presented. The difference in the anticipatory eye movements in the two groups of children was obtained. In the TLD group the average duration of the anticipatory gaze was more than 2, 5 s in the first (»syntactic«) condition, while shorter in the second (»semantic«) condition (≈ 2 s). In the SLI group the anticipatory eye movements were shorter in the »syntactic« condition (1, 4 s) and slightly longer in the »semantic« condition (1, 6 s). This pattern of results reveals the difference in language processing in the two groups of participants: while children with TLD use the syntactic information in sentence structure building in a top–down processing, children with SLI rely on the semantic information as a compensation strategy for their language difficulty...|$|R

The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the legal institute of sports contracts of minors, not only {{from the standpoint of the}} legislative system, but also from the practical point of view, where particular attention is paid to the legal uncertainty and frequent invalidity of such contract provisions. In the introduction to the main topic of the paper, the legal terms of “minors” and “sports contracts” are considered, followed by a brief presentation of relevant legal sources. Since the law of the Republic of Croatia does not include an explicit definition of the terms of minors and sports contracts, their meaning is primarily explained. Hence, it is established that a minor is a person under eighteen years of age, while sports contracts are defined as contracts sui generis, the particularities of which do not stem from their characteristics in the meaning of the law of obligations, but from mere substantive facts, namely between which parties such a contract is concluded and what its subject is. All the preconditions for the validity of sports contracts of minors are further presented, including the issue of invalidity of contract in cases where such preconditions are not fulfilled. The second part of the paper concerns the shortcomings of the relevant regulations of the Croatian Football Association, as well as the Croatian Basketball Federation. This topic is further elaborated from the international law standpoint, in order to indicate necessary future legislative changes. The author suggests certain changes de lege ferenda, of which the most important is the idea of establishing a special register of sports contracts of minors. The main purpose of the paper, therefore, is to draw attention to the inadequate legislative regulation of minors in sports in terms of the law of obligations, all with the aim of advocating changes de lege ferenda...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Increasing {{evidence}} {{has shown that}} immune surveillance is compromised in a tumor-promoting microenvironment for patients with {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC), and can be restored by appropriate chemotherapy. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we analyzed microarray gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 30 patients with newly-diagnosed advanced stage NSCLC, and 20 age-, sex-, and co-morbidity-matched healthy controls. All the patients received a median of four courses of chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine for a 28 -day cycle as first line treatment. RESULTS: Sixty-nine differentially expressed genes between the patients and controls, and 59 differentially expressed genes before and after chemotherapy were identified. The IL 4 pathway was significantly enriched in both tumor progression and chemotherapy signatures. CXCR 4 and IL 2 RG were down-regulated, while <b>DOK</b> 2 and <b>S</b> 100 A 15 were up-regulated in the patients, and expressions of all four genes were partially or totally reversed after chemotherapy. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR for the four up-regulated (S 100 A 15, DOK 2) and down-regulated (TLR 7, TOP 1 MT) genes in the patients, and the six up-regulated (TLR 7, CRISP 3, TOP 1 MT) and down-regulated (S 100 A 15, DOK 2, IL 2 RG) genes after chemotherapy confirmed the validity of the microarray results. Further immunohistochemical analysis of the paraffin-embedded lung cancer tissues identified strong S 100 A 15 nuclear staining not only in stage IV NSCLC as compared to stage IIIB NSCLC (p =  0. 005), but also in patients with stable or progressive disease as compared to those with a partial response (p =  0. 032). A high percentage of S 100 A 15 nuclear stained cells (HR 1. 028, p =  0. 01) was the only independent factor associated with three-year overall mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a potential role of the IL 4 pathway in immune surveillance of advanced stage NSCLC, and immune potentiation of combination chemotherapy. S 100 A 15 may serve as a potential biomarker for tumor staging, and a predictor of poor prognosis in NSCLC...|$|R

The altarpiece from St. Mark 2 ̆ 7 s church, Madonna with the Child, St. Francis and St. Anthony, is attributed to Pietro Liberi (1605 - 1687), Venetian painter from the late Baroque. The smaller altarpiece, the Annunciation, St. Anthony and, St. Jerome was commissioned {{by the members of}} the family of sailors for the chapel of St. Anthony which they built in the 18 th century.

These tunes partly origin from the earlier Glagolitic liturgical musical heritage, on the other side leaning on the activities of two members of the ecclesiastical enlightening trends of {{the second half of the}} 18 and the early 19 centuries, Father Petar Knežević (1702 - 1768) and Father Paškal Jukić (1748 - 1806). The tunes are analysed in several layers; through various aspects of their historic, cultural, ethno-musicological, literary, socio-anthropological and liturgical determinations and rekognisabilities. Confirmed is the wide spread of the texts by Knežević and Jukić with the appertaining tunes, over an entire network of various places in the coastal and hinterland parts of Dalmatia (including also Herzegovina), that is certainly to be added also the power of their spatial and historic continuity and rootedness. This entire situation is permeated with the simultaneous existence of two main facts: the preserved initial textual and melodic patterns and richness of their numerous (local) variants, and the development of special tunes that are closely related to particular places - Solin, in this case. These qualities first and foremost relate to the vitality and live dynamism of the natural course of maturing and development of the folk (both ecclesiastical and profane) tune as a live and coherent social substance. This is evident in the singing of the Folk Singers (Pučki pivači) choir of the church of Our Lady of Islet, for many years now participating in liturgical celebrations in the Solin parish church; in their Marian (O prislavna, Božja Mati; Litanije lauretanske BDM; Veseli se, Majo Božja) and saints worshiping tunes (Stipan jur blaženi). Although it is impossible to exactly determine the age or certain of the facts related to the tunes of Solin, indirect logical conclusions still makes possible noticing a significant number of social and historic circumstances. In the background of this situation, in situ is also felt a deeper historic determination, that - sometimes more and sometimes less markedly - implies a view to the historic course from the Salonitan and the Old-Croatian ages to the times of activities of fraternities of the last few centuries. Of particular importance is the genuine tune of Solin, O prislavna, characterised by melodic richness and suggestiveness of its expression, whereas the Christmas song Stipan jur blaženi most certainly makes a successful paraphrase of the song Ovoga vrimena...|$|R

The present paper aims to determine, on the example of fifty verbal neologisms which have emerged in the last twenty years, whether they fit into the grammatical categories which are traditionally related to verbs. From the viewpoint of word formation, the paper examines if the new verbs are derived from native or foreign bases, which processes and morphemes are productive and to what extent the word-formational characteristics of Croatian neologisms match the existing descriptions of word formation in Croatian. Furthermore, special attention is paid to the category of aspect. It has been noticed that among the identified verbal neologisms there is a large number of biaspectual ones (asemblirati, bekapirati, dajdžestirati), while the aspectual doublets of the perfective verbs, if they do exist, are very rare and stylistically marked (dramiti – izdramiti, lajkati – odlajkati, eskortirati – *odeskortirati). The increase in the number of biaspectual verbs is linked to their foreign origin, i. e. to only partial integration into the linguistic system of Croatian. This also has an effect on the heterogeneity of the aspectual meanings of the verb, which are a direct result of the inability to add prefixes and suffixes to these new verbs. The paper also focuses on the valence of verbal neologisms with a special emphasis on their number and the morphosyntactic features of their complements. It has been observed that the newly-formed verbs display an undeveloped valence, which affects the sentential models in which only a small number of complements and adjuncts are realized. The need for a re-examination of the existing models of grammatical description has arisen as {{the result of the}} appearance of new reflexive verbs which are impossible to describe by resorting to traditional methodology (čekirati se, overdozirati se, logirati se). The description of the grammatical features of verbal neologisms in this paper also includes the extralinguistic factors, i. e. the communication spaces that the majority of the examples of newly identified verbs come from. The domain of the new media shapes different rules for communicating information, which affects both the form and the grammatical features of verbs, and the syntactic makeup of the sentences they are used in...|$|R

Autorica analizira ovaj putopis kao kulturno-povijesnu činjenicu te kao tekst koji se upisuje u književni podžanr putopisnih tekstova. Sadržaj teksta, kao i njegov kulturološki okvir, propituje se kroz analizu sa španjolskoga na hrvatski jezik prevedenih naratoloških sekvenci, <b>dok</b> se poveznica <b>s</b> etnografijom definira na razini opisa kao osnovne strukturne odrednice kako etnografskoga tako i književnog teksta. In {{a broader}} {{sense of its}} connotative meaning, this article is a {{contribution}} to retrospective ethnological work or historical ethnology, the last syntagm corresponding to the Jacques Le Goff 2 ̆ 7 s concept. These perspectives are to be seen through comprehending the article {{as an attempt to}} find analytical tools for re-reading the re-discovered travelogue ‘Recuerdos de un viaje al país de los Eslavos del Sur’, which was written by Georges Perrot in the years which follow the travel that took place in 1868. The text elaborated in this article was published in Barcelona in 1878. This attempt includes re-reading the Perrot’s work as a kind of report on un-known, but clearly framed, territories, which was presented to his Spanish audience through series of structured descriptions and critical comments. While partly transfering sequences of Perrot’s thick descriptive figures to Croatian language, the author of the article emphasises the tendency of his suggestive text to, with its descriptive techniques which are at the same time part of literary as well ethnographical descriptive practices and traditions, inform readers about the country of South Slavs in a popularly scientific and, at the same time, literary manner. However, the point of this critical reading of Perrot 2 ̆ 7 s text is exactly in juxtaposing those truly meaningful and creative way of transforming experiences of people and places into the text which are to be read from subjective descriptions, and, on the other hand, to criticize the way in which Perrot, while trying to be highly objective in his comments, steps into critical field of subjective judgemental thinking and writing about people and places. In trying to penetrate the layers of complex life styles and manifold forms of habitats of the Un-known and Other, while supporting his statements with data and numbers, according to the author of the article, he speaks as much about the culture of his origin as about the culture which he describes. In this particular travelogue, the described culture, or the culture of the Other, is the culture of South Slavs, while the culture of the origin of the Observer, or the Writer, is blurred on the horizon as the ideal and dominant one. In conclusion, the subjectivity of Perrot 2 ̆ 7 s thick descriptive technique is seen as the utmost quality of his travelogue 2 ̆ 7 Memories from the Journey to the Country of South Slavs 2 ̆ 7, though some judgemental syntagms with which French writer attributes described societies (like patriarchal communism, e. g.) the author of the article, in her attempt to do retrospective ethnological analysis, would not discard as groundless...|$|R
40|$|Vođenje rata, kao jedna od najstarijih „aktivnosti“ čovječanstva, oduvijek se pokušavalo opravdati. Kao rezultat takvih nastojanja proizašao je već zarana pojam pravednog rata. Taj je pojam proživio stoljeća i tisućljeća ljudskog postojanja <b>dok</b> nije suočen <b>s</b> apsolutnom zabranom rata u 20. stoljeću. Međutim ni tada nije nestao. Ne više izričito „ratovi“, već različiti slučajevi upotrebe sile opravdavaju se na jednak ili sličan način kao i „klasični“ ratovi s pomoću elemenata pojma pravednog rata. U 2014. godini dogodila se intervencija jedne suverene države u drugoj, koja se pokušala opravdati elementima pojma pravednog rata. The {{concept of}} a just war {{developed}} {{as an effort to}} restrict wars by rules of conduct during a state of war, and to limit the causes of starting war in the first place. The main elements of the {{concept of a}} just war were set and elaborated by St. Thomas Aquinas. In his understanding, war could only be justified if three criteria were met: a) war is declared by a sovereign authority (auctoritas principis); b) the war has a just cause (iusta causa); c) and there is also a righteous intention (recta intentio) of those waging the war, which is the promotion of good and avoidance of evil. In the 20 th century, an absolute prohibition of war was introduced by the UN Charter. However, some space was left for the legitimate use of force in two cases – in the case of self-defence {{and in the case of}} a collective action of the United Nations when there is a threat to peace, disruption of peace, or an act of aggression. However, self-defence has proved to be an incredibly elastic term (ranging from interceptive, the controversial aspect of anticipatory, to the most controversial of all, pre-emptive self-defence). There have also been attempts to subsume actions, under collective actions, that do not belong there. In addition to the dubious forms of self-defence, in the last 70 years countries have also used force in various other situations that could not be subsumed under self-defence, and which, by repeating themselves in several patterns, have led to the identification of several forms of use of force – different unilateral interventions. The interventions of one or several states by using force in the territory of another state for different reasons and justifications are the most frequent form of the modern use of force which stretches the rules (prohibitions) of international law on the use of force. The following main reasons have been given in practice: pro-democratic intervention, intervention to protect one 2 ̆ 7 s own citizens, and humanitarian intervention. By explaining them, countries again, just as at the time prior to any legal regulation of wars, justify their use of force by the just cause that they aim to achieve, they prove their righteous intentions, they persuade the international community that they have no other choice, and thus they opt for their only remaining choice. In brief, contemporary states wage just wars. The beginning of 2014 was very intensive in Ukraine, and although the subject-matter of this paper ends with the end of the first six months, those events continued after this period. The protests of citizens, who were favouring the pro-European options against the pro-Russian ones, led to a change in leadership. Dissatisfied with how the events had been evolving, Russia supported the efforts of the Crimean Russian population for independence (and subsequent annexation to Russia). To begin with, Russia persistently denied the presence of its military forces in the territory of Crimea, but eventually admitted this. If we keep in mind the definition of aggression stated in the UN General Assembly Resolution and the detailed description of the facts in place, no other conclusion may be drawn but that Russia committed aggression against Ukraine. Russia 2 ̆ 7 s justification for its own actions contained the elements that make up the concept of a just war: defending the innocent (just cause), as well as the main intention which guided Russia 2 ̆ 7 s decision (righteous intention). Therefore, Russia conducted its “just war” against Ukraine in 2014, justifying it as an intervention requested by the legitimate government of Ukraine (deposed President Yanukovych) ...|$|R
40|$|U sklopu {{monitoring}}a dabrova u Hrvatskoj i Srbiji nakon njihove reintrodukcije, evidentiraju se gubici dabrova prema mjestu i vremenu uginuća, uzroku, spolu i starosti jedinke. Podaci se prikupljaju pomoću mreže suradnika, odnosno po evidenciji događaja. Na temelju analize prikupljenih podataka o stradanju dabrova u proteklih 18 godina, uočava se porast stradalih dabrova, posebice nakon porasta populacije i prostornog širenja dabrova, odnosno 10 godina nakon ispuštanja u Hrvatskoj. U promatranom razdoblju u Hrvatskoj je evidentirano ukupno 111 gubitaka dabrova, dok je u Srbiji taj broj znatno manji i iznosi 36 jedinki. U Srbiji nije primjetan proporcionalni porast stradanja dabrova u odnosu na dinamiku populacije. Najviše dabrova stradava u prometu, 40 % u Hrvatskoj i 17 % u Srbiji, te nezakonitim lovom i ribolovom 22 % u Hrvatskoj i 19 % u Srbiji. Iznimku čini jedna jedinka koja je stradala uslijed pada stabla na odraslog dabra. Često se kod pronalaska lešine ne može utvrditi uzrok uginuća 21 % u Hrvatskoj i 28 % u Srbiji. U Srbiji je utvrđen značajan udio uginuća zbog bolesti, čak 25 % evidentiranih gubitaka. Što se tiče starosne strukture stradalih dabrova, najvećim dijelom stradavaju adultne jedinke a potom subadultne, <b>dok</b> je, <b>s</b> obzirom na brojne nepotpune informacije, često starost nepoznata. Kada se analizira spol stradalih jedinki, također je nepoznato najviše zastupljeno, što je donekle razumljivo jer ne postoji kod dabra izraženi spolni dimorfizam, a kod utvrđenog spola neznatno više stradava mužjaka. S obzirom na vrijeme stradavanja, najviše jedinki je evidentirano u proljeće i jesen, dok najmanje dabrova stradava tijekom zime. Kao mjere zaštite dabrova u prvom redu poziva se na poštivanje zakonskih propisa vezano za ilegalni lov i ribolov, a stradavanju u prometu moguće je smanjiti ili ponegdje u potpunosti spriječiti postavljanjem žičane ograde uz prometnicu na problematičnim prijelazima. Također se mogu uspješno spriječiti gubici kod radova na vodotocima u području koje nastanjuju dabrovi, da se stručno i tehničko osoblje koje obavlja zahvat na uređenju vodotoka educira i orijentira na mjere zaštite dabrova kod izvođenja radova (zaštita nastambi i jedinki od radnih strojeva). Takozvani „opasni“ objekti u koje dabrovi mogu upasti i u njima stradati, mogu se prilagoditi na način da se dabrovima onemogući ulazak u takav prostor ili da se osigura mogućnost izlaska iz takovog prostora. U biti, zaštita dabrova provodi se dobrom medijskom prezentacijom i informiranjem javnosti o dabru i njegovom način života, mjerama zaštite i edukacijom građana. Takva izravna komunikacija omogućava i jednostavnije prikupljanje podataka o dabrovima, uključujući i podatke o stradalim ili uginulim jedinkama. Population {{monitoring of}} beavers in Croatia and Serbia is being continuously run {{since the first}} release of beavers in 1996. in Croatia(Grubešić i Krapinec, 1998, Grubešić, 2014). Serbia has started with monitoring in 1999. When the first beak has been registered {{in the north of}} Vojvodina and it has been intensified since 2004. when they started with inhabitation – reintroduction (Ćirović, 2010). As a part of monitoring beavers in Croatia and Serbia since their reintroduction, beaver losses are being recorded by place and time of death, cause, sex and age of individuals. Information is being gathered with help of a network of associates, and by evidence of events. Based on the analysis of gathered information on beaver killings in the past 18 years a growth of killed beavers has been noticed, especially after the population growth and territorial expansion of beavers, and 10 years after the release in Croatia. In the observed period in Croatia a total of 111 beaver losses have been registered, while in Serbia this number is significantly lower and amounts to 36 individuals. Based on registered beaver losses a significant rise in beaver losses in the past 7 years has been noticed on the territory of Republic of Croatia. Actually the number of killed individuals has risen significantly when the beaver population has stabilized and increased its numbers and after 10 years since the inhabitation. In Serbia, despite the stabilization and territorial expansion, registered losses are relatively small, and stagnation or slight drop in killed or died animals has been noted. The main factor of mortality in Croatia and Serbia has been traffic. About one third of beavers (50 individuals) have been killed in traffic accidents. Traffic share in beaver mortality is equal or even somewhat smaller when compared to results from some parts of Germany, where this share is from 50 % to even 86, 5 % (Pokorny and associates 2014., Muller 2014). Strangulation in fishing nets has been the second most significant beaver loss in populations on the territory of Posavina and Podravina (22 beavers – 15 %). Autopsy unquestionably proved that 17 beavers (11. 6 %) died from illness. For 33 of them (22, 4 %), due to untimely findings or delivery to autopsy, a precise cause of death could not have been determined. When we look at beaver loss causes on the territory of Republic of Croatia traffic absolutely dominates, followed by unknown causes, and in third place illegal hunting and fishing (especially gillnets). In Serbia alongside unknown causes significant influences have diseases. From all 147 losses, only one beaver has been killed underneath a tree. Even though it has been noted he has been “killed at work” the position of the beavers body and tree points that the killing was not a consequence of knocking down the tree in question (Picture 1 and 2), but that the tree fell on the beaver as it has been passing by, most likely as a consequence of wind blowing the bitten tree down or exceptionally that an another individual knocked down the tree and it fell on the beaver passing by. Mostly adult individuals are being killed (Croatia 39, Serbia 14 beavers) which is linked to their increased activity in search for food and in moving about in general. Reasearch of other authors also shows that adult individuals are mostly being killed and mainly females (Pokorny and associates 2014). Sub adult individuals are being killed when exploring the territory (new locations) or when they inhabit a zone where the get killed easily, especially in traffic. This age group has mostly been killed in Serbia (15 beavers). In relation to sexual structure in Croatia and in Serbia a larger number of males were killed than females. Unfortunately, for half of killed beavers {{we were not able to}} tell the sex. If we look at beaver killing on a seasonal level, then two periods stick out, mostly spring then autumn. In spring beavers move more, especially the sub adult ones in search for foo and exploration of new habitats, while in autumn when they are more active in agricultural lands, they are being killed in traffic or in illegal hunting (this influence is most likely significantly bigger than the recorded one, but the prefix “illegal” points to unavailability of information and data on individuals killed this way). Illness for now are not a more significant cause of population loss, but in the future, especially in areas overcrowded by beaver, the might have a more significant role in the reduction of population, considering that we are dealing with a species (rodents) that are sensitive to certain diseases (leptospirosis, tularemia) (Parker and ass. 1951, Hopla 1974, Hornfeldti sur. 1986, Morneri sur., 1988, Wolli sur. 2012). Certain problems or flaws in delivering information on losses emerge due to associates not being educated; these are accidental findings by people who have seen this species most likely for the first time. Apart from that some information has been delivered without details that would give a clearer picture in determining a cause of death, age and sex. As a measure of protecting beavers first in line is respecting the legislation connected to illegal hunting and fishing, and the traffic killing might be decreased or somewhere completely prevented by setting up a wire fence alongside roads in troubling crosses. Also losses can be successfully prevented in watercourse construction in territories inhabited by beavers, that the personnel that is carrying out the construction is being educated and pointed to beaver protection measures while carrying out the work (lodge and animal protection from excavators). So called “dangerous” objects in which beavers can fall into and get hurt, can be adjusted in a way that beavers are enabled to get into such spaces but also to ensure the possibility of getting out from such a space. Beaver protection is being carried out by good media presentation and informing the public of beavers and their way of life, protection measures and citizen education. Such direct communication enables and simplifies information gathering on beavers, also including information on killed or died individuals...|$|R
