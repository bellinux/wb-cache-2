La manière d'être plus que simple, puis-qu'il logeait sous une canonnière, et qu'il n'avait pas même de chaises dans sa tente, son affabilité, sa bonhomie lui conciliaient l'affection de tous les individus de son armée.

II mangeait dans sa tente assis par terre autour d'une natte sur laquelle il prenait le plus détestable repas. L'apres-midi, un semblable repas lui servait de souper, il s'endormait ensuite pendant quelques heures, passait une partie de la nuit à chanter, et a la pointe du jour il sortait presque nu et se roulait sur l'herbe assurant que cet exercice lui était necessaire pour le preserver des rhumatismes.... Sa manière de s'exprimer dans toutes les langues est aussi singulière que toute sa façon d'être, ses phrases sont incohérentes, et s'il n'est pas insensé, il dit et fait du moins tout ce qu'il faut pour le paraître; mais il est heureux et cette quality dont le Cardinal Mazarin faisait tant de cas, est, à bon droit, fort estimée de l'Impératrice et du Prince Potemkin ...

6000|$|Janet little {{suspected}} that special preparations {{had been made}} for her comfort. Early in April, while the wilderness {{was still in the}} grip of winter, Delphin had been summoned from a far-away lumber camp to Saint Hubert, where several packing-cases and two rolls of lead pipe from Montreal lay in a shed beside the railroad siding. He had superintended the transportation of these, on dog sledges, up the frozen <b>decharge,</b> accompanied on his last trip by a plumber of sorts from Beaupre, thirty miles down the line; and between them they had improvised a bathroom, and attached a boiler to the range! Only a week before the arrival of Madame the spring on the hillside above the camp had been tapped, and the pipe laid securely underground. Besides this unheard-of luxury for the Lac du Sablier there were iron beds and mattresses and little wood stoves to go in the four bedrooms, which were more securely chinked with moss. The traditions of that camp had been hospitable. In Professor Wishart's day many guests had come and gone, or pitched their tents nearby; and Augusta Maturin, until this summer, had rarely been here alone, although she had no fears of the wilderness, and Delphin brought his daughter Delphine to do the housework and cooking. The land for miles round about was owned by a Toronto capitalist who had been a friend of her father, and who could afford as a hobby the sparing of the forest. By his permission a few sportsmen came to fish or shoot, and occasionally their campfires could be seen across the water, starlike glows {{in the darkness of the}} night, at morning and evening little blue threads of smoke that rose against the forest; [...] "bocane," [...] Delphin called it, and Janet found a sweet, strange magic in these words of the pioneer.|$|E
6000|$|In {{order to}} reach the camp on Lac du Sablier from the tiny {{railroad}} station at Saint Hubert, a trip of some eight miles up the <b>decharge</b> was necessary. The day had been when Augusta Maturity had done her share of paddling and poling, with an habitant guide in the bow. She had foreseen all the needs of this occasion, warm clothes for Janet, who was wrapped in blankets and placed on cushions {{in the middle of}} a canoe, while she herself followed in a second, from time to time exclaiming, in a reassuring voice, that one had nothing to fear in the hands of Delphin and Herve, whom she had known intimately for more than twenty years. It was indeed a wonderful, exciting, and at moments seemingly perilous journey up the forested aisle of the river: at sight of the first roaring reach of rapids Janet held her breath--so incredible did it appear that any human power could impel and guide a boat up the white stairway between the boulders! Was it not courting destruction? Yet she felt a strange, wild delight in the sense of danger, of amazement at the woodsman's eye that found and followed the crystal paths through the waste of foam.... There were long, quiet stretches, hemmed in by alders, where the canoes, dodging the fallen trees, glided through the still water... No such silent, exhilarating motion Janet had ever known. Even the dipping paddles made no noise, though sometimes there was a gurgle, as though a fish had broken the water behind them; sometimes, in the shining pools ahead, she saw the trout leap out. At every startling flop Delphin would exclaim: [...] "Un gros!" [...] From an upper branch of a spruce a kingfisher darted like an arrow into the water, making a splash like a falling stone. Once, after they had passed through the breach of a beaver dam, Herve nodded his head toward a mound of twigs by the bank and muttered something. Augusta Maturin laughed.|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} model for dusty plasma afterglow has been developed. Comparison with experimental data {{shows that the}} transition from ambipolar to free diffusion {{plays a major role}} in the <b>decharging</b> process Dusty or complex plasmas are ionised gases composed of electrons, ions and neutral species in which macroscopic charged dust particles are immersed. The dust particle charge (Qd) is related to the ion and electron currents (Ii and Ie respectively) onto the surface of the dust particle: dQd dt = Ie + Ii (1) These currents depend on the particle radius rd, the electron (ion) density and the electron (ion) temperature [1]. At equilibrium, currents compensate each other. In laboratory plasma, these particles are negatively charged due to a higher mobility of the electrons. The dust particle charging process is thus highly dependent on plasma species densities and temperatures. Many publications are devoted to the study of dust particle charge (see for example [2, 3, 4]). Recently the <b>decharging</b> of dust particles in complex plasma afterglow raises interest as well as the dust particle residual charge [5, 6, 7]. Indeed it has been observed that dust particles do keep residual electric charges when the power of a RF discharge is turned off. Moreover, negatively charged, neutral and positively charged dust particles have been obeserved in the late afterglow of the RF discharge. A four stage model has been proposed in order to explain these results (Fig. 1) [6]: • Firstly, the electron temperature decreases while the plasma density remains almost constant resulting in a strong decrease of dust particle charges. • Secondly, the plasma density decreases but ion and electron densities remain equal leading to almost no change in particle charge. 34 th EPS 2007; L.

Upon "free decharging" conditions, the charge distribution had a sharp peak at zero and was rather symmetric (with charges concentrated between - 10 e and + 10 e), yet positively and negatively charged particles were homogeneously distributed over the cloud. However, when <b>decharging</b> evolved in the presence of an external DC field (applied shortly before the plasma switch-off) practically all residual charges were positive.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to reporting poor practices, the Court judges the accounting of public financial and budgetary officials, collection agencies, or treasury departments, e.g., treasurers, paymasters-general, tax collectors, certified public accountants, and can fine them for late reporting.

40|$|XLF-Cernunnos (XLF) is a {{component}} of the DNA ligase IV-XRCC 4 (LX) complex, which functions during DNA non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Here, we use biochemical and cellular approaches to probe the impact of XLF on LX activities. We show that XLF stimulates adenylation of LX complexes de-adenylated by pyrophosphate or following LX <b>decharging</b> during ligation. XLF enhances LX ligation activity in an ATP-independent and dependent manner. ATP-independent stimulation can be attributed to enhanced end-bridging. Whilst ATP alone fails to stimulate LX ligation activity, addition of XLF and ATP promotes ligation {{in a manner consistent with}} XLF-stimulated readenylation linked to ligation. We show that XLF is a weakly bound partner of the tightly associated LX complex and, unlike XRCC 4, is dispensable for LX stability. 2 BN cells, which have little, if any, residual XLF activity, show a 3 -fold decreased ability to repair DNA double strand breaks covering a range of complexity. These findings strongly suggest that XLF is not essential for NHEJ but promotes LX adenylation and hence ligation. We propose a model in which XLF, by in situ recharging DNA ligase IV after the first ligation event, promotes double stranded ligation by a single LX complex...|$|R

Cr K edge XANES spectra have been simulated for different near neighbour environments around the Cr^ 3 + recombination centres and compared with the experimental curve. In Cr^ 3 +:ZnGa_ 2 O_ 4 compound, the Cr^ 3 + local structure corresponds mostly to that of a normal spinel (∼ 70 %), while the rest comprises of distorted octahedral environment arising from cationic site inversion and a contribution from chromium clustering. This local structure is strongly different in Cr^ 3 +:MgGa_ 2 O_ 4 and Cr^ 3 +:ZnAl_ 2 O_ 4 where, for both cases, chromium clustering represents the main contribution.

The scanning mode spectra (SMS) are obtained by tracking the thermal motion of the grains, with the interaction strength then determined from the frequencies and the eigenvector configuration of the normal modes.

The interaction of the top particle acting on the bottom particle is repulsive in the vertical direction and attractive in the horizontal direction. The vertical interaction from the top to bottom particle is stronger than that from the bottom to top particle, agreeing with an extended ion wake tail as predicted by the inhomogeneous ion wake theory. Determination of the horizontal attraction strength serves as a direct verification and quantification of the ion wake effect. Heating of the lower particle in both the vertical and horizontal directions is observed and quantitatively related to the nonreciprocity of the interaction.
