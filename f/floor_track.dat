5|$|The {{most common}} serious {{injuries}} were multiple lower leg fractures and dislocations, spinal fractures, hip fractures, head injuries, and multiple lacerations and contusions. The NTSB investigators found severe {{damage on the}} floor of the cabin, leading many of the passengers' seats to fracture where the legs met the <b>floor</b> <b>track.</b> This fracturing permitted many of the seats to come loose during the impact and aggravated the passengers' injuries. The report posits that the passengers' legs hit the lower seat frames in front of them. At the same time, the seats collapsed and twisted downward and to the left, likely causing hip and spinal fractures. As the impact progressed, the seats, now separated, flung passengers forward into each other as well as into other wreckage, causing head injuries and lacerations. Passengers holding onto infants reported being unable to either prevent their children from being ejected from their grasp in the impact or locate their children in the darkness afterward. The NTSB held that, had the children been in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved child seats, many injuries might have been mitigated. Rescuers remarked that some infants were found smiling or seemingly unharmed. The NTSB was unable to accurately chart where individual passengers were seated because Avianca only assigned seats to a few passengers and many who were assigned reported moving after takeoff.|$|E

5000|$|In 1980, {{the band}} {{recorded}} a four track session for Capital Radio and one track, [...] "Robot's Dance", was played regularly by DJ Nicky Horne.

In 2008 the facilities were revamped once again, installing an embedded granule track featuring four-lane straightaways, two-lane ovals, and a pole vault pit. Additionally, a turf infield has been included to allow training {{by many of the}} University's sports teams.

40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} the Physiological Cost Index (PCI) {{in a sample}} population of 12 healthy adults aged over 65 years, on a treadmill versus a 10 -metre <b>floor</b> <b>track.</b> Method: Subjects were studied on two occasions, one week apart. On each occasion the subjects performed a floor walking test and a treadmill walking test according to a randomized, crossover design. During each trial the subjects' walking speed, resting heart rate and walking heart rate were measured. The PCI (beats/metre) - an empirical measure of the energy efficiency in gait - was calculated from the net heart rate (walking heart rate - resting heart rate {beats/ minute}) divided by the walking speed (metre/minute). Results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation and significance established at p< 0. 01. Results: There {{was no significant difference}} between the mean resting and walking heart rates during treadmill and floor walking. The treadmill walking speed (61. 21 ± 19. 27 metre/minute) was significantly slower than the floor walking speed (72. 17 ± 12. 02 metre/minute). Thus the treadmill PCI (0. 60 ± 0. 26 beats/metre) was significantly higher than the floor walking PCI (0. 43 ± 0. 13 beats/metre). Clinical relevance: The results of this study suggest that a floor walking track offers a more functional medium than the treadmill for assessing the PCI in elderly subjects. 6 page(s...|$|E

40|$|A {{study has}} been {{conducted}} into the design of civil aircraft seats which are forward-facing and use the lap-belt method of restraint. Within these terms of reference, {{the response of the}} seat restraint occupant system (SROS) to impact loading has been analysed using physical (dynamic testing) and analytical (computer simulation) modelling techniques. With the increasing use of fibre-reinforced polymer composites in aircraft for weight efficiency, and the consequent appearance of composite seats, attention must be given to the crash performance of these structures. Composite structures are characterised by brittle failure with low impact energy absorption, in comparison to the collapse of metal structures which may exhibit plastic deformation prior to failure. However, using the developing technology of composite sub-structures with high specific energy absorption capability, seat structures have been modified to incorporate composite load-limiting elements. The redesign process involved the compatibility of energy absorber loads with occupant dynamics to minimise injury potential, together with the alleviation of forces in the structural load path to reduce damage and preclude failure of the seat, <b>floor</b> <b>track,</b> and other components. Shortcomings of existing seat designs were assessed, and the dynamics of lap-belted occupants analysed, including secondary head impact with the forward seat structure. The computer' model created was validated against the results of dynamic tests, and then used in a parametric study of occupant dynamics. Conclusions and recommendations include guidlines relating to the future design of both metal and composite seats...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a robust tracking system for autonomous robots equipped with omnidirectional cameras. The proposed method uses a 3 D shape and color-based object model. This allows to tackle difficulties that arise when the tracked object is placed {{above the ground}} plane <b>floor.</b> <b>Tracking</b> under these conditions has two major difficulties: first, observation with omnidirectional sensors largely deforms the target’s shape; second, the object of interest embedded in a dynamic scenario may suffer from occlusion, overlap and ambiguities. To surmount these difficulties, we use a 3 D particle filter to represent the target’s state space: position and velocity {{with respect to the}} robot. To compute the likelihood of each particle the following features are taken into account: i) image color; ii) mismatch between target’s color and background color. We test the accuracy of the algorithm in a RoboCup Middle Size League scenario, both with static and moving targets. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{seats are}} {{designed}} to withstand strong forces {{so as not to}} break or come loose from their <b>floor</b> <b>tracks</b> during turbulence or accidents. The backs of seats are often equipped with a fold-down tray for eating, writing, or as a place to set up a portable computer, or a music or video player. Seats without another row of seats in front of them have a tray that is either folded into the armrest or that clips into brackets {{on the underside of the}} armrests. However, seats in premium cabins generally have trays in the armrests or clip-on trays, regardless of whether there is another row of seats in front of them. Seatbacks now often feature small colour LCD screens for videos, television and video games. Controls for this display as well as an outlet to plug in audio headsets are normally found in the armrest of each seat.|$|R
