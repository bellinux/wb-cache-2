40|$|Technical {{developments}} {{in the last ten}} years have made possible mapping and sequencing of the entire human genome, along with the possibility of treating genetic disorders by manipulating DNA. A variety of issues regarding potential uses and abuses of these technologies have become apparent. They relate to both genetic screening and <b>gene</b> <b>therapy.</b> Problems facing individuals and their families mostly revolve around rights of self-determination and of confidentiality. Health care professionals will need to design optimal systems to provide genetic counseling, and to protect confidentiality of DNA data bases. Society and social institutions will need to develop policies and laws that protect the privacy of individuals whose DNA is stored in data banks. Patenting of the results of gene research remains controversial internationally. Moreover, there is concern in many quarters about society’s potential abuse of gene technology for eugenic purposes. <b>Gene</b> <b>therapy</b> is now a reality. There is little disagreement on the use of <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> to treat genetic diseases in individuals by somatic cell therapy. There is much controversy, however, over the use of <b>germ-line</b> cell <b>therapy.</b> <b>Gene</b> technology has contributed to the growth among a small group of influential people of the Post-Modern Movement, which is strongly antiscience and antitechnology.

40|$|The role of {{immunoglobulin}} structural {{genes in}} the generation of autoantibodies in humans has not been elucidated. Human monoclonal IgM anti-IgG autoantibodies (rheumatoid factors, RFs) from unrelated people often share idiotypic antigens. Antibodies against synthetic peptides have localized two of the shared idiotypic determinants to {{the second and third}} complementarity-determining regions of the kappa light chain. The reported sequences of several human RF light chains are remarkably homologous in these regions. Animal studies have shown that some shared idiotypic antigens represent serological markers for immunoglobulin variable (V) -region genes. Therefore, we hypothesized that human RF light chains derived from a single <b>germ-line</b> <b>gene,</b> designated V kappa-(RF), or from a small family of very closely related genes. In the present experiments, we have isolated and sequenced two human V kappa <b>germ-line</b> <b>genes</b> that encode kappa light chains, which are identical or closely related to the light chains of human RF. The data indicate that the shared idiotypic antigens on RF are phenotypic markers for a kappa V-region gene that is highly conserved in the human population.

40|$|With {{pre-implantation}} {{genetic diagnosis}} (PGD), genetic testing and selective transfer of embryos is possible. In the future, <b>germ-line</b> <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> (GLGT) applied to embryos before implantation, {{in order to}} introduce missing genes or replace mutant ones, may be possible. The objective of this dissertation is to analyse moral aspects of these technologies, as described by eighteen British, Italian and Swedish gynaecologists and geneticists. The objective is systematised into three parts: research interviews and qualitative analysis, philosophical analysis, and elaboration of a framework that supports the combination of analytic methods. PGD was described as positive since it enabled some couples at risk for a genetic disease {{to have a child}} without the disease. PGD was described as in different senses ‘better’ than methods for prenatal diagnosis and selective termination of pregnancy. It was also described as positive since it provided couples at risk with one more option, even if it did not result in the birth of a healthy child. However, interviewees were concerned about the difficulty of defining and evaluating genetic disease. They were also concerned about patients’ choices, and about exaggerated use or misuse. Whereas PGD gave rise to ambivalence in terms of how to understand, describe and evaluate it, GLGT was often described as unrealistic or undesirable. The results of the qualitative analysis are used in a philosophical analysis of the concepts of choice, autonomous choice, ambivalence, trust and ambivalence in trust relations. A set of distinct characteristics of each concept are elaborated. The results of the philosophical analysis are used in the discussion {{of the results of the}} qualitative analysis. The study shows that the technologies imply both ‘new’ ways to perform ‘old’ medical practices and ‘new’ practices. Old moral questions are reformulated. New moral questions are added. Against the background of this, the concept of genetic identity is discussed.

40|$|Intravenous {{immunoglobulin}} preparations (IVIG) {{have shown}} positive {{effects in the}} treatment of immune defects and autoimmune diseases. It is not clear how IVIG interacts with the components of the immune system. To investigate this, we cloned previously a large number of phage displayed IgG Fab fragments derived from three patients with autoimmune thrombocytopenia (AITP) that were specifically bound by IVIG molecules. Many of these Fabs reacted with platelets. Sequencing revealed that the most frequently used <b>germ-line</b> <b>gene</b> segments of all IVIG-bound Fabs were identical to those observed for many other autoantibodies. Particularly, the loci 3 – 30 or 3 – 30 / 3 – 30. 5, 3 – 23 and 3 r, 3 l, and 2 a 2 represented the most abundant genes used for the heavy (VH) and light chain V region (VL), respectively. This suggested a specific interaction of IVIG molecules with B cells that present B cell receptors derived from these <b>germ-line</b> <b>genes.</b> In the current study we determined the genetic origin of IVIG-reactive IgG and IgM cloned from a healthy person. A favoured selection of antibodies derived from the same germ-line origins as in AITP was observed. Because 3 – 30 and 3 – 23 are the most frequently rearranged VH <b>germ-line</b> <b>gene</b> segments among human B cells, our results suggest that this favoured anti-idiotypic interaction may have an important role for the development and control of the normal B cell repertoire...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Recombinant DNA {{technology}} will soon allow physicians {{an opportunity to}} carry out both somatic cell- and <b>germ-line</b> <b>gene</b> <b>therapy.</b> While somatic cell gene therapy raises no new ethical problems, gene therapy of gametes, fertilized eggs or early embryos does raise several novel concerns. The first issue discussed here relates to making a distinction between negative and positive eugenics; the second issue deals with the evolutionary consequences of lost genetic diversity. In distinguishing between positive and negative eugenics, the concept of malady is applied as a definitional criterion for identifying genetic disorders that could qualify for germ-line therapy. Because gene replacement techniques are currently unavailable for humans, and because {{even if they were}} possible the number of people involved would be quite small, the loss of diversity concern seems moot. Finally, we dissuss the issue of iatrogenic disorders associated with gene therapy and discuss several 'real world considera-tions/ Key Words: germ-line therapy, malady, slippery slop...|$|E

Deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid are used in <b>gene</b> <b>therapy.</b> Over time and with proper oversight, human <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> might become an effective weapon in modern medicine&#x 2032;s arsenal to help fight diseases such as cancer, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, diabetes, high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases, cystic fibrosis, hemophilia and other genetic disorders. <b>Gene</b> <b>therapy</b> trials in humans are of two types, somatic and germ line <b>gene</b> <b>therapy.</b> There are many ethical, social, and commercial issues raised by the prospects of treating patients whose consent is impossible to obtain. This review summarizes deoxyribonucleic acid-based therapeutics and gene transfer technologies for the diseases that are known to be genetic in origin. Deoxyribonucleic acid-based therapeutics includes plasmids, oligonucleotides for antisense and antigene applications, deoxyribonucleic acid aptamers and deoxyribonucleic acidzymes. This review also includes current status of <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> and recent developments in <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> research...|$|R
