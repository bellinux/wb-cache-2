Conductivity measurements and electrochemical behavior have been also carried out. The results obtained reveal that the highest conductivities are obtained in those samples heated to the maximum temperature studied. Stability towards oxygen increases with treatment temperature, reaching the samples treated to 1273 K for 2 hours, a gasification temperature similar to the graphite material studied.

Aging of precursor RF monoliths with 1 N HCl aq. {{was found to}} markedly increase the hydrophobicity of the corresponding CMHs as characterized by water vapor adsorption experiments conducted at 298 K. Analysis of the water vapor adsorption data indicates that levels of hydrophobicity of CMHs {{are similar to those}} exhibited by other types of highly hydrophobic adsorbents, such as a coal-derived activated carbon and a defect-free pure silica zeolite Beta. HCl aging also drastically changes the porous structure of CMHs from microporous to micro/mesoporous as characterized by nitrogen adsorption/desorption experiments. Because of significantly enhanced hydrophobicity of CMHs as well as hierarchical pore structure (straight macropores connected with micro/mesopores), CMHs can readily separate 1 -butanol molecules from a diluted aqueous solution at 310 K and demonstrate high capacities (up to approximate to 3. 13 mol kg(- 1) at a 1 -butanol concentration of 135 mM). The unique morphology of CMHs, consisting of straight macropores coupled with micro/mesopores embedded within honeycomb walls, and the highly hydrophobic surface properties offer future prospects of CMHs in various applications that require fast separation of hydrophobic molecules from a large volume of aqueous solutions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe year 2014 {{marks the}} first decade of the rise of graphene. Graphene, a single atomiclayer of carbon atoms in sp 2 bonding {{configuration}} <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>honeycomb</b> <b>structure,</b> has nowbecome a well-known and well-established material. Among some of its many outstandingfundamental properties, one can mention a very high carrier mobility, a very large spindiffusion length, unsurpassed mechanical properties as graphene is the strongest materialever measured and an exceptional thermal conductivity scaling more than one order ofmagnitude above that of copper. After the first years of the graphene rush, graphene growthis now well controlled using various methods like epitaxial growth on silicon carbidesubstrate, chemical vapour deposition (CVD) or plasma techniques on metal, insulator orsemiconductor substrates. More applied research is now taking over the initial studies ongraphene production. Indeed, graphene is a promising material for many advancedapplications such as, but not limited to, electronic, spintronics, sensors, photonics,micro/nano-electromechanical (MEMS/NEMS) systems, super-capacitors or touch-screentechnologies. In this context, this Special Issue of the Journal of Physics D: AppliedPhysics on graphene reviews some of the recent achievements, progress and prospects inthis field. It includes a collection of seventeen invited articles covering the current statusand future prospects of some selected topics of strong current interest. This Special Issue isorganized in four sections. The first section is dedicated to graphene devices, and opens with an article by de Heeret al on an investigation of integrating graphene devices with silicon complementarymetal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) technology. Then, a study by Svintsov et al proposesa lateral all-graphene tunnel field-effect transistor (FET) with a high on/off current switchingratio. Next, Tsukagoshi et al present how a band-gap opening occurs in a graphene bilayerby using a perpendicular electric field to operate logic gates. Plac¸ais et al then show therealization of graphene microwave nano-transistors that are especially suitable for fastcharge detectors. Matsumoto et al describe next some interesting graphene-based biosensorapplications, while the following article by Otsuji et al shows recent advances in plasmonicsin terahertz device applications. This section ends with the Dollfus et al article dealing withnon-linear effects in graphene devices investigated by simulation methods. The second section concerns the electronic and transport properties and includes fourarticles. The first one by Gurzadyan et al provides an investigation of graphene oxide inwater by femtosecond pump–probe spectroscopy to study its transient absorption properties. Jouault et al then review the quantum Hall effect of self-organized graphene monolayersepitaxially grown on the C-face of SiC. Next, Petkovic et al report on the observation ofedge magneto-plasmons in graphene. Finally, Roche and Valenzuela focus on the limits ofconventional views in graphene spin transport and offer novel perspectives for furtherprogress. The third section addresses graphene tailoring and functionalization as studied byGenorio and Znidarsic for graphene nanoribbons, or by atomic intercalation as shown bythe two articles from Starke and Forti, and from Bisson et al. The last section is devoted to graphene growth and morphology. Ogino et al firstdescribe a method to grow graphene on insulating substrates using polymer films as acarbon source. Then, Suemitsu et al show the recent progresses in epitaxial grapheneformation on cubic silicon carbide thin films.

30|$|Penta-graphene (PG), {{which can}} be exfoliated from bulk T 12 carbon, {{is one of the}} most {{recently}} proposed graphene allotropes, and it consists of repeating carbon pentagon structures [17]. Some investigations have predicted that PG is stable with fixed lattice constants [17, 18]. It <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>honeycomb</b> <b>structure</b> and is <b>a</b> promising metal-free, low-cost catalyst for low-temperature CO oxidation [19]. Nitrogen-doped PG displays very high catalytic activity and is more competitive with many metal-based and carbon-based catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation owing to the very small energy barrier of the rate-limiting step [20]. It has also been reported that transition-metal-doped PG is a potential hydrogen-storage material [21]. Furthermore, unlike graphene, PG is an intrinsic quasi-direct-band-gap semiconductor with a band gap in the range 1.52 – 4.48  eV [8, 17, 22], implying an enormous potential for application in semiconductor gas sensors. In addition, PG <b>has</b> <b>a</b> unique hybrid bond structure containing both sp 3 and sp 2 carbon bonds. Owing to the tetrahedral character of the sp 3 hybridization of carbon bonds, PG is not ideally planar, but rather oscillates out-of-plane in a periodic corrugated manner [17], indicating more possible positions for gas adsorption as a sensing element.|$|R

A creep curve for the gomatofu could be analyzed by using a 4 -element model. Hardness and elasticity of Hookean and Voigt (E_ 0,E_ 1) of the (A) sample cooked for 25 min decreased with mixing time {{for all of the}} samples under various mixing rates, and after 25 min of cooking increased with cooking time because of weight loss.

40|$|A new {{strategy}} is developed to prepare porous microspheres with narrow size distribution for peptides controlled release, involving a fabrication of porous microspheres without any porogens {{followed by a}} pore closing process. Amphiphilic polymers with different hydrophobic segments (poly(monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol-co-D,L-lactide) (mPEG-PLA), poly(monomethoxypolyethylene co-glycolic acid) (mPEG-PLGA)) are employed as microspheres matrix to prepare porous microspheres based on a double emulsion-premix membrane emulsification technique combined with a solvent evaporation method. Both microspheres possess narrow size distribution and porous surface, which are mainly caused by (a) hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) segments absorbing water molecules followed by a water evaporation process and (b) local explosion of microspheres due to fast evaporation of dichloromethane (MC). Importantly, mPEG-PLGA microspheres <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>honeycomb</b> like <b>structure</b> while mPEG-PLA microspheres <b>have</b> <b>a</b> solid structure internally, illustrating that the different hydrophobic segments could modulate the affinity between solvent and matrix polymer and influence the phase separation rate of microspheres matrix.

40|$|Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are {{a recent}} class of {{materials}} built up from metal ions or clusters {{held together by}} organic polycomplexing linkers. The wide variety in building units makes that they offer an unprecedented chemical and structural diversity. The hybrid nature of these materials allows adsorbate interactions both with the inorganic and organic nodes of the framework, creating unique interaction possibilities. Most research is devoted to adsorption and separation of gasses on MOFs, while liquid phase separations especially in aqueous phase are scarcely investigated. Furthermore, when considering the industrial implementation of MOFs as adsorbents their mechanical behaviour during shaping operations should be investigated more deeply. In a first part ofnbsp;thesis, the removal of nitrogen and sulfur compounds fromnbsp;is investigated with several MOFs pursuing different strategies. The direct adsorptivenbsp;of S-heterocycles was investigated with the CPO- 27 series. This series <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>honeycomb</b> <b>structure</b> in which the pores are lined with open metal sites (Ni 2 +, Co 2 +, Mg 2 +, Cu 2 +, Zn 2 +). It isnbsp;that {{the nature of the}} exposed open metal sites <b>has</b> <b>a</b> clear influence on the adsorption capacity and affinity, with CPO- 27 (Ni) having the highest affinity and capacity for all testednbsp;Computational experimentsnbsp;that this outstanding performance is due to an optimal interactionnbsp;thenbsp;nickel site and the sulfurnbsp;of the S-heterocycle. In a second strategy, the selective removal of nitrogen compounds is investigated with the mesoporous MIL- 100 series. The results show a clear influence of the metal sites (V, Cr, Al, Fe) on the affinity and adsorption enthalpies for nitrogen and sulfur compounds. The availability of open metal sites and the possibility of having additional H-bond acceptor sites are importantnbsp;contributing to the observed affinity differences for the differently metallated MOFs. In a third strategy, the adsorptive removal of N/S-compounds from fuels was investigated with a fully coordinated and flexible material, namely MIL- 53 (Fe). By using in situ energy dispersive X-ray diffraction the influence of the solvent and adsorbate properties on the framework flexibility was studied. MIL- 53 (Fe) displays a remarkable uptake preference, whereby strong H-bond acceptors like benzothiophene are superior in uptake kinetics andnbsp;compared to H-bond donors like indole. In a second part, it is shown that the stablenbsp;of the MIL- 140 type display exceptional performance innbsp;phenol mixtures, outperforming other material classes like zeolites, silicas, carbons and other metal-organic frameworks. By combining experimental adsorption data with computational input, it is shown that the optimal pore shape of MIL- 140 C allows for a convenient separationnbsp;ortho vs para-substituted phenols, due to packing effects. On the other hand, the highly hydrophobic pore surface allows for an enthalpic separation between phenols with different functional groups (like methoxy, methyl or hydroxy). nbsp;combination of enthalpic and entropic separation mechanisms results in distinct windows of separation in column breakthrough experiments withnbsp;phenol mixtures. In a final part, the mechanical properties of MOF films and powdersnbsp;investigated. First, electrochemically synthesized Cu-MOF films were characterized with a combination of nano-indentation and scratch experiments. Differences in hardness, elasticity and adhesionnbsp;of the films are found {{to be related to the}} structural differences between the Cu-MOFs. Finally, the effect of mechanical stresses during powder shaping conditions was investigated for different Zr-MOFs, as these are predicted to be amongst the more mechanically robust frameworks. An inverse relationship between framework collapse and porenbsp;was established under ball-milling conditions. Addition of acid modulators during the synthesis of UiO- 66, resulted in a striking improvement of the mechanical robustness. The increased strength of Zr-carboxylate bonds is in line with the pKa values of the used modulators. nrpages: 157 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{energies}} and temperature-dependent dynamics of hydrogen and lithium chemisorption on a silicon nanosheet, called silicene, were studied using density functional theory and molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations. Silicene <b>has</b> <b>a</b> buckled <b>honeycomb</b> <b>structure,</b> and <b>has</b> been fabricated as suspended monolayer sheets and nanoribbons in recent experiments. We calculated the adsorption energies of hydrogen and lithium on silicene for different adsorption ratios between 3. 1 % and 100 %. The studies will clarify {{the characteristics of}} these novel and promising nanomaterials, and {{pave the way for}} their applications. For Hydrogen, the adsorption energy <b>had</b> <b>a</b> maximum of 3. 01 eV/H for complete hydrogenation, and decreased by 24. 5 % to 2. 27 eV/H for single atom adsorption on a 32 -silicon-atom supercell. It was determined that the preferred hydrogen adsorption patterns were clusters. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed the stability of adsorption configurations at 300 K. The electronic structure of these stable configurations could be modified and controlled through partial and complete hydrogenations, and a transformation from zero-gap semiconductor to insulator was observed. For lithium on silicene, the adsorption energy <b>had</b> <b>a</b> maximum of 2. 23 eV/Li for 50 % lithiation and decreased by 29. 6 % to 1. 57 eV/Li for 100 % lithiation. For partial Lithium adsorptions up to 50 %, the preferred adsorption sites were hollow sites on top of silicon hexagons. This preference changed as more lithium atoms were introduced. At a 100 % adsorption ratio, the lithium atoms adsorbed to sites directly above or below the silicon atoms. Unlike hydrogenated silicene, the band structure of each partially lithiated structure was shown to be that of a metal. Combining hydrogen and lithium adsorptions, it was shown that silicene-Li nanocompounds can be considered for hydrogen storage...|$|R
40|$|A {{monolayer}} of {{a transition}} metal dichalcogenide (TMD) such as WSe$_ 2 $ is a two-dimensional (2 D) direct band-gap valley-semiconductor <b>having</b> <b>an</b> effective <b>Honeycomb</b> lattice <b>structure</b> with broken inversion symmetry. The inequivalent valleys in the Brillouin zone could be selectively addressed using circularly-polarized light fields, suggesting the possibility for magneto-optical measurement and manipulation of the valley pseudospin degree of freedom. Here we report such experiments that demonstrate the valley Zeeman effect [...] strongly anisotropic lifting of the degeneracy of the valley pseudospin degree of freedom using an external magnetic field. While the valley-splitting measured using the exciton transition {{is consistent with the}} difference of the conduction and valence band orbital magnetic moments, the trion transition exhibits an unexpectedly large valley Zeeman effect which cannot be understood using an independent electron-hole picture. Instead, we find an explanation using the recently predicted large Berry curvature and the associated magnetic moment for the electron-hole exchange interaction modified trion dispersion. Our results raise the possibility of observing optical excitation induced valley Hall effect in monolayer TMDs or topological states of photons strongly coupled to trion excitations in a microcavity...|$|R
40|$|Semiconductor {{quantum dots}} (QDs) have {{attracted}} significant interest in sensitized solar cells. The semiconductor QDs exploit as <b>a</b> sensitizer and <b>have</b> several advantages such as quantum confinement, large extinction coefficient, and multiple exciton generation. A successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method is an ion-by-ion growth of thin films and provides high {{coverage of the}} electrode. Therefore, the SILAR method is a fascinating process for preparation of CdSe QDs. In addition, an inverse opal TiO 2 (IO-TiO 2) film <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>honeycomb</b> <b>structure</b> with large interconnected pores that lead to a better infiltration of electrolyte in a photoelectrochemical cell. To investigate {{the effect of the}} electrode morphology, we have studied the optical absorption properties of CdSe QDs adsorbed on IO-TiO 2 and nanoparticulate TiO 2 (NPTiO 2) electrodes for comparison, including the photovoltaic properties of CdSe QDs sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). CdSe QDs were grown on an IO-TiO 2 and NP-TiO 2 surface by a SILAR method for different cycles. A sandwich structure solar cell was consisted of Cu 2 S on brass as a counter electrode and a polysulfide (S/S 2 -) redox system as the electrolyte. The average diameter of the QDs was estimated by applying an effective mass approximation to the optical absorption spectra. Linear dependence {{of the size of the}} QDs with increasing number of cycles was confirmed by a redshift in the optical absorption spectrum. The average diameter of the CdSe QDs on the IO-TiO 2 electrodes was similar to that on the NP-TiO 2 ones, indicating that growth is independent of morphology. However, there were more CdSe QDs on the NP-TiO 2 electrodes than on the IO-TiO 2 ones, indicating that there were different amounts of active sites on each type of electrode. In addition, the Urbach parameter (as a guide of disordered states) of the exponential optical absorption tail was also estimated from the optical absorption spectrum. The Urbach parameter of CdSe QDs on IO-TiO 2 electrodes was higher than that on NP-TiO 2 ones, indicating that CdSe QDs on IO-TiO 2 electrodes are more disordered states than those on NP-TiO 2 electrodes. The Urbach parameter decreases in both cases with the increase of SILAR cycles, and it tended to move toward a constant value. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and photovoltaic properties of sandwich structure solar cells were studied under an illumination of air mass (AM) 1. 5 using Cu 2 S on brass as a counter electrode and a polysulfide (S/S 2 -) redox system. The photosensitization of CdSe QDs on TiO 2 electrodes in the visible region could be observed in both electrode morphologies. The IPCE spectra of both IO-TiO 2 and NP-TiO 2 cells were shifted to low photon energy region because a size of CdSe QDs on TiO 2 grows with increasing SILAR cycle. The lower IPCE in IO-TiO 2 cell comparison with NP-TiO 2 cell could be because of a fewer adsorption of Cd 2 + ions, and smaller surface area. The maximum photovoltaic conversion efficiency (η) of CdSe QDs on IO-TiO 2 was 1. 3 % and that of CdSe QDs on NP-TiO 2 was 2. 7 %, prepared with 9 cycles. Lower η of CdSe QDs on IO-TiO 2 than that on NP-TiO 2 was possibly because of the lower adsorption of Cd 2 + ions, a larger amount of surface states, and lower TiO 2 surface area. In this study, the series resistance (Rs) could assume that depends on the charge transfer resistance in TiO 2 film adsorbed with CdSe QDs. The estimated Rs of IO-TiO 2 cell is larger than NP-TiO 2 one. A possible reason for the different Rs, the QDs on IO-TiO 2 has fewer amounts than the QDs on NP-TiO 2, which result in the QDs on IO-TiO 2 has fewer injected electrons than the QDs on NP-TiO 2. These results indicate that the CdSe SILAR cycle is the important condition that affects the photovoltaic properties of CdSe QDSSCs. 電気通信大学 201...|$|R
