6000|$|From this {{proceeding}} Mr. Forster dissented, and {{he resigned}} his office. His point {{seems to have}} been that no suspect should be released until the new Coercion Act had been fashioned, whereas the rest of the cabinet held that there was no excuse for the continued detention under arbitrary warrant of men as to whom the ground for the “reasonable suspicion” required by the law had now disappeared. He probably felt that the appointment of a viceroy of cabinet rank and with successful Irish experience was in fact his own supersession. “I have received your letter,” Mr. Gladstone wrote to him (May 2), “with much grief, but on this it would be selfish to expatiate. I have no choice; followed or not followed I must go on. There are portions of the subject which touch you personally, and which seem to me to deserve much attention. But I have such an interest in the main <b>issue,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could not be deemed impartial; so I had better not enter on them. One thing, however, I wish to say. You wish to minimise in any further statement the cause of your retreat. In my opinion—and I speak from experience—viewing the nature of that course, you will find this hardly possible. For a justification you, I fear, will have to found upon the doctrine of ‘a new departure.’ We must protest against it, and deny it with heart and soul.” ...|$|E

This is an <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have {{spent a good deal of}} time on in the past year because I believe so strongly that we are all more secure when children and adults around the world are taught math and science instead of hate. The bill we are voting on today includes authorization for an International Youth Opportunity Fund, which will provide resources to build schools in Muslim countries. The legislation also acknowledges that the U.S. has a vested interest in committing to a long-term, sustainable investment in education around the globe. Some of this language is modeled on legislation that I introduced in September, The Education for All Act of 2004, and I believe it takes us a small step towards eliminating madrassas and replacing them with schools that provide a real education to all children.|$|E

The very idea that any member of the Naval Academy family could be part of an environment that fosters sexual harassment, misconduct, or even assault is of great concern to me, and it is contrary to all {{we are trying to do}} and achieve. Preventing and deterring this unacceptable behavior is a leadership <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> and all the Academy leaders take to heart. The public trusts that the Service Academies will adhere to the highest standards and that we will serve as beacons that exemplify character, dignity and respect. We will increase our efforts to meet that trust." [...] Superintendent Rempt has recently been criticized for not allowing former Navy quarterback Lamar Owens to graduate, despite his acquittal on a rape charge. Some alumni have attributed this to an overeagerness on Rempt's part to placate critics urging a crackdown on sexual assault and harassment.|$|E
5000|$|According to Grimes, {{around when}} she first began songwriting she had a {{realization}} as to how music was created after listening to Panda Bear's album Person Pitch, which she describes [...] "jumpstarted" [...] her mind. She explains, [...] "Up until that point I had basically only made weird atonal drone music, with no sense of songwriting. I barely understood anything about music, {{it seemed like a}} mystery. But suddenly all music clicked into place and seemed so simple and easy. I was pretty much able to spontaneously write songs immediately after listening to this album once." [...] On her music making process she has also said, [...] "I have a nervous tic. When I was a kid, I would constantly be banging on things with my foot. Making music has been a really good mechanism for releasing some kind of percussive <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have. It's usually about finding a perfect beat; I play around until I get a tempo I like and then it's just a matter of filling in the blanks". Grimes utilizes looping and layering techniques, particularly with vocals; many of her songs feature layers of over fifty different vocal tracks which create an [...] "ethereal" [...] sound.|$|E

[...] She did not repeat that she believed that cancer was a fungus or that salt water could flush it out.

Which alternative form of relationism should be endorsed instead (if any) is then an issue to be discussed at another occasion...|$|E
40|$|With every {{discovery}} {{emerging from}} the world of science over the last 500 years concerning the origins of the universe and of life itself, the traditional explanations offered by the Christian Church appeared to be more and more dated and irrelevant.   Christian leaders, unable to embrace the knowledge revolution seemed to believe  {{that the only way to}} save Christianity was not to disturb the old patterns either by listening to, much less by entertaining the new knowledge. I tried to articulate this challenge in a book entitled: Why Christianity Must Change or Die, published in 1998.   In <b>that</b> book <b>I</b> examined in detail the <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was convinced Christianity must address. Shortly after that book was published I reduced its content to twelve theses, which I attached in Luther-like fashion to the great doors on the Chapel of Mansfield College at Oxford University in the United Kingdom. I then mailed copies of those Twelve Theses to every acknowledged Christian leader of the world. It was an attempt to call them into a debate on the real <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was certain the Christian Church now faced.   I framed my twelve theses in the boldest, most provocative language possible, designed primarily to elicit response and debate.
