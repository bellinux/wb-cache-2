5000|$|In the 19th century, various patents {{were awarded}} in the U.S. and Europe for {{commercial}} roasters, {{to allow for}} large batches of coffee. Nevertheless, home roasting continued to be popular. A man working at a commercial roasting plant beginning in the 1850s in St. Louis, Missouri, said that [...] "selling roasted coffee was up-hill work, as everyone roasted coffee in the kitchen oven." [...] Appliances catering to the home roaster were developed; <b>in</b> 1849 <b>a</b> spherical coffee roaster was invented in Cincinnati, Ohio, for use {{on the top of}} a wood-fired kitchen stove, fitted into a burner opening. Green beans were available at the local general store, or even through mail order. For roasting, many people used such simple methods as a layer of beans on <b>a</b> metal sheet <b>in</b> the oven, or beans stirred <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cast iron <b>skillet</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> fire. Despite the wide popularity of home roasting, Burns felt that it would soon disappear because of the great strides made in commercial roasting in the 1860s and 1870s, including the benefits of the economies of scale. The commercial roaster inventions patented by Burns revolutionized the U.S. roasting industry, much like the innovations of inventors in Emmerich am Rhein greatly advanced commercial coffee roasting <b>in</b> Germany. <b>As</b> well, the 1864 marketing breakthrough of the Arbuckle Brothers in Philadelphia, introducing the convenient one-pound (0.45 kg) paper bag of roasted coffee, brought success and imitators. From that time commercially roasted coffee grew in popularity until it gradually overtook home roasting during the 1900s in America. In 1903 and 1906 the first electric roasters were patented in the U.S. and Germany, respectively; these commercial devices eliminated the problem of smoke or fuel vapor imparting a bad taste to the coffee. In France, the home roaster did not yield to the commercial roaster until after the 1920s, especially in rural areas. Coffee was roasted to <b>a</b> dark color <b>in</b> small batches at home and by shopkeepers, using a variety of appliances including ones with a rotating cylinder of glass, sheet iron or wire mesh, and ones driven by hand, clockwork or electric motor. Because of the smoke and blowing chaff, country dwellers generally roasted outdoors.|$|R

5000|$|The {{species has}} been used in antiquity for the {{production}} of potash, hence: its Arabic name, ušnān. The 10th-century Arab physician, al-Tamimi, described the plant in his day as being imported into Palestine, Egypt and other countries from the riverine gulches around the vicinity of Amman, in Transjordan, and used in the production of an alkali soap (Arabic: غاسول = ġāsūl) and of cleaning agents. According to al-Tamimi, the plants were gathered in their fresh, green-state in large bundles, transferred to furnaces made with plastered floors and stone spouts, where they were cast inside, beneath which were laid large timbers that were set aflame, causing the melting alkali-substance to drip down by the spouts into a threshing-floor directly below. The liquid would there be collected and eventually become hardened when it cooled-off, the finished product resembling a hard black-colored stone. The stone-like mineral could be broken-up into smaller fragments and used as a laundry detergent. Some of the salt bushes produced a type of potassium alum (Arabic: shab) that was brownish <b>in</b> color, having <b>a</b> strong alkalinity and burning effect when tasted. Al-Tamimi adds that one of the chemical elements had by burning Seidlitzia's succulent green leaves is al-qalī, which, besides being a natural cleansing agent, its [...] "plant ashes" [...] (potash) could be converted into potassium by placing the ashes into a pot, adding water thereto, and heating it until one is left with an evaporated solution. When this solution was mixed with coarsely ground yellow-orpiment (...) and with oil extracted from unripe olives, heated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ceramic <b>skillet</b> placed <b>over</b> <b>a</b> fire, and turned constantly with an iron spoon until it congeals (having the fire actually touch it until it turns reddish in color), it too, according to al-Tamimi, is said to have certain medicinal properties, said to prevent tooth decay, as well as in assuaging blood loss from the gums. It is also said to be useful in removing halitosis. When the substance congeals, stirring ceases, and the substance is then allowed to burn completely while remaining in the ceramic skillet. It is then taken-up while still hot and is pounded by mortar and pestle, until one is left with a fine powder. It is then sifted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sieve and stored until ready for use. A quantity of one dirham-weight (ca. 3.31 g during Ottoman times) was traditionally applied with one's finger to the effected part of the gums in the mouth, and allowed to remain there for one hour. Its application, however, {{is said to have been}} quite unpleasant because of its severe burning effect and strong alkalinity. After which, the mouth was rinsed with cold water, followed by gargling with Persian rose oil to aid in the mouth's cooling.|$|R
