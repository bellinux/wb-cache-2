5|$|Since its {{completion}} in 1968, the Oroville Dam has allocated {{the flow of}} the Feather River from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta into the State Water Project's California Aqueduct, which provides a major supply of water for irrigation in the San Joaquin Valley as well as municipal and industrial water supplies to coastal Southern California, and has prevented large amounts of flood damage to the area — more than $1.3 billion between the years of 1987 and 1999. The dam has confined <b>fish</b> <b>migration</b> up the Feather River and the controlled flow of the river {{as a result of the}} Oroville Dam has affected riparian habitat. Multiple attempts at trying to counter the dam's impacts on <b>fish</b> <b>migration</b> have included the construction of a salmon/steelhead fish incubator on the river, which began shortly after the dam was completed.|$|E
5|$|For Upper Bonnington, {{the first}} dam {{built on the}} river, the {{original}} goal was to improve navigation between Kootenay Lake and the Kootenay's mouth on the Columbia by drowning the dangerous Bonnigton Falls rapids that also blocked <b>fish</b> <b>migration,</b> and hopefully introducing fish to the upper river by constructing a fish ladder. None of these amenities for steamboats or salmon were ever constructed—in fact, the dam ended up being built above the falls instead of below them—and Upper Bonnington Dam, when completed in 1906, only generated hydroelectric power, and has served that purpose ever since.|$|E
5|$|The {{installation}} of dams dramatically altered {{the landscape and}} ecosystem of the river. At one time, the Columbia {{was one of the}} top salmon-producing river systems in the world. Previously active fishing sites, such as Celilo Falls in the eastern Columbia River Gorge, have exhibited a sharp decline in fishing along the Columbia in the last century, and salmon populations have been dramatically reduced.

5|$|Since {{the late}} 19th century, {{public and private}} sectors have heavily {{developed}} the river. To aid ship and barge navigation, locks have been built along the lower Columbia and its tributaries, and dredging has opened, maintained, and enlarged shipping channels. Since the early 20th century, dams have been built across the river for power generation, navigation, irrigation, and flood control. The 14 hydroelectric dams on the Columbia's main stem and many more on its tributaries produce more than 44percent of total U.S. hydroelectric generation. Production of nuclear power has taken place at two sites along the river. Plutonium for nuclear weapons was produced for decades at the Hanford Site, which is now the most contaminated nuclear site in the US.

5|$|The Klamath is {{the most}} {{important}} North American river south of the Columbia River for anadromous <b>fish</b> <b>migration.</b> Its salmon, steelhead and rainbow trout have adapted to unusually high water temperatures and acidity levels relative to other rivers in the Pacific Northwest. The numerous fish were a major source of food for Native Americans, who have inhabited the basin for at least 7,000years. The first Europeans to enter the Klamath River basin were fur trappers for the Hudson's Bay Company in the 1820s; they established the Siskiyou Trail along the Klamath and Trinity rivers into the Sacramento Valley. Within several decades of white settlement, native peoples were forced into reservations. During the latter days of the California Gold Rush, increasing numbers of miners began working the Klamath River and its tributaries, causing considerable harm to the environment. Conflict and introduced diseases left indigenous tribes with only 10% of their original population.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, twenty-one {{northwest}} Washington tribes, {{joined by}} the United States filed a Request for Determination in U.S. District Court, asking the court {{to find that the}} State of Washington has a treaty-based duty to preserve fish runs and habitat sufficiently for the tribes to earn a “moderate living,” and sought to compel the state to repair or replace culverts that impede salmon migration. On August 22, 2007, the district court issued a summary judgment order, holding that while culverts impeding andromadous <b>fish</b> <b>migration</b> are not the only factor diminishing their upstream habitat, in building and maintaining culverts that impede salmon migration, Washington State had diminished the size of salmon runs within the case area and thereby violated its obligation under the Stevens Treaties. On March 29, 2013, the court issued an injunction ordering the state to significantly increase the effort for removing state-owned culverts that block habitat for salmon and steelhead, and to replace the state-owned culverts that have the greatest adverse impact on the habitat of andromadous fish by 2030.|$|E

40|$|The Kamniška Bistrica {{river is}} 33 km long, it {{originates}} below the Kamnik-Savinja Alps, runs southward past Kamnik and Domžale, and flows in the Sava river {{just above the}} confluence of the rivers Sava and Ljubljanica. Its torrential character has resulted in regular flooding, so there has been always a tendency for its regulation and exploitation of water power. With the construction of barriers and dams for the purposes of slowing down the current, stabilization of the stream channel, insurance against erosion and fortified banks and embankments for flood protection, the river system was interrupted both longitudinally and laterally. All riparian and aquatic species, especially fish, have been exposed to the effects of these changes. The worst damage was made to the types of fish, which migrates over longer distances. Many species couldn’t adapt to the changes in the aquatic environment, and had disappeared from the river. Numerous transverse water structures are interrupting the longitudinal connectivity of the Kamniška Bistrica river and doesn’t allow <b>fish</b> <b>migrations,</b> so essential for their existence – particularly for potamodromous <b>fish</b> (<b>migrations</b> within inland waters) and diadromous <b>fish</b> (<b>migrations</b> between oceans / seas and inland waters) which are almost extinct. In this thesis we are getting to know the characteristics of the Kamniška Bistrica River Basin and its features, and assess the impact of numerous transverse water structures, as well as other factors that affect fish communities of Kamniška Bistrica. Our main objective is to identify those water structures, of which improvements on free passage for fish and other aquatic organisms would contribute most largely to the improvement of longitudinal connectivity of the Kamniška Bistrica river...|$|R
40|$|Animal migrations provide {{important}} ecological functions and can allow for increased biodi-versity through habitat and niche diversification. However, aquatic migrations in general, {{and those of}} the world’s largest fish in particular, are imperiled worldwide and are often poorly understood.

These species are important apex predators in the main stem rivers of the Amazon Basin and make up the region’s largest fishery.

5|$|The Columbia Basin {{is noted}} for its spring floods, major flood years were 1876, 1894, 1948 and 1964. As {{recently}} as the mid-1960s, the upper Columbia and Kootenay rivers in British Columbia were still free-flowing and unaffected by dams and reservoirs, resulting in the 1948 Vanport Oregon flood. The uncontrolled discharge past the Canada-U.S. border created problems for electricity generation in the US, and Canada also wanted to utilize the Columbia river {{for the production of}} hydroelectric power. Negotiated in 1961 between the governments of the two countries, the Columbia River Treaty attempted to ratify these problems. Construction of the first three of the four dams authorized by the treaty—Mica, Keenleyside and Duncan—was implemented in 1964. Of the four dams, the first two are on the Columbia, the third is on the Duncan River, a tributary of the Kootenay, and the fourth Libby, on the Kootenay River proper. However, operation of the dams has led to environmental problems in both rivers because they have caused unnatural flow fluctuations, blocked <b>fish</b> <b>migration,</b> flooded fertile agricultural land, and forced over 2,000 people to relocate.|$|E
5|$|The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) {{divides the}} waters of the Columbia and its tributaries into three {{freshwater}} ecoregions, naming them Columbia Glaciated, Columbia Unglaciated, and Upper Snake. The Columbia Glaciated ecoregion, making up {{about a third of the}} total watershed, lies in the north and was covered with ice sheets during the Pleistocene. The ecoregion includes the mainstem Columbia north of the Snake River and tributaries such as the Yakima, Okanagan, Pend Oreille, Clark Fork, and Kootenay rivers. The effects of glaciation include a number of large lakes and a relatively low diversity of freshwater fish. The Upper Snake ecoregion is defined as the Snake River watershed above Shoshone Falls, which totally blocks <b>fish</b> <b>migration.</b> This region has 14species of fish, many of which are endemic. The Columbia Unglaciated ecoregion makes up the rest of the watershed. It includes the mainstem Columbia below the Snake River and tributaries such as the Salmon, John Day, Deschutes, and lower Snake Rivers. Of the three ecoregions it is the richest in terms of freshwater species diversity. There are 35species of fish, of which four are endemic. There are also high levels of mollusk endemism.|$|E

40|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>migrations</b> {{into the}} streams of seasonally-flooded {{depressions}} (or dambos) {{that cover the}} central plateaus of Africa are a well-known phenomenon to scientists and lay people alike. However, the factors causing seasonal migrations are poorly understood and most scientific references to them are anecdotal, lacking rigorous description. <b>Fish</b> <b>migrations</b> into dambos in Zimbabwe were investigated during the 1999 / 2000 rainy season, by electrofishing and using traps. The fish fell into two categories: those that used the dambo, and those that remained in the main river. At {{the beginning of the}} rainy season Barbus paludinosus, B. lineomaculatus, Clarias gariepinus and Tilapia sparrmanii moved from the perennial river into the small dambo streams and spawned there, then moved back to the perennial river, leaving their young in the dambo, which acted as a nursery area. Barbus spp. were the most numerous migrants and they moved mainly during daylight hours. Other fish species present in the system included Opsaridium zambezense, Leptoglanis rotundiceps, Chiloglanis neumanni, Labeo barbus marequensis, Labeo cylindricus, Oreochromis mossambicus, Tilapia rendalli, Marcusenius macrolepidotus and Micropterus salmoides. These did not enter the dambo streams but remained in the perennial river.

25|$|Most years, off {{southern}} Africa between May and July, {{billions of}} sardines (specifically the Southern African pilchard Sardinops sagax) spawn {{in the cool}} waters of the Agulhas Bank and move northward along {{the east coast of}} South Africa. This great <b>fish</b> <b>migration</b> is called the sardine run. Their sheer numbers create a feeding frenzy along the coastline. The run, containing millions of individual sardines, occurs when a current of cold water heads north from the Agulhas Bank up to Mozambique where it then leaves the coastline and goes further east into the Indian Ocean. During the sardine run, as many as 18,000 dolphins, behaving like sheepdogs, herd the sardines into bait balls, or corral them in shallow water. Once rounded up, the dolphins and other predators take turns ploughing through the bait balls, gorging on the fish as they sweep through. Seabirds also attack them from above, flocks of gannets, cormorants, terns and gulls. The sardine run is featured in the first episode of the 2001 BBC nature documentary The Blue Planet and in the 2008 3D IMAX documentary film Wild Ocean.|$|E

40|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>migrations</b> {{can deliver}} {{materials}} and energy against stream currents and provide important subsidies to stream ecosystems. There is an extensive literature on Pacific salmon, which are semelparous, showing that marine-derived nutrients {{are incorporated into}} all stream and riparian trophic levels where salmon migrations occur, and that these nutrients can spur productivity. In contrast, there is little research {{on the role of}} iteroparous fishes. I investigated the effects of iteroparous sucker (Catostomidae) migrations on nutrient dynamics, algal growth, and caddisfly (Limnephilidae: Limnephilus spp.) growth in a small, oligotrophic Lake Michigan tributary, using experimental barriers to establish reaches with and without a sucker migration. Soluble reactive phosphorus and ammonium became elevated during the sucker migration at treatment reaches relative to reference reaches while nitrate dynamics did not differ between treatments. Algal and caddisfly growth were higher in reaches receiving a sucker migration. Limnephilus in enclosures with a sucker carcass became rapidly enriched in δ 15 N and δ 13 C indicating assimilation of sucker materials. Stable isotope data from the field suggest assimilation of sucker N but not C, but this result could not be confirmed statistically due to gaps in the data. This study suggests that iteroparous <b>fish</b> <b>migrations</b> can provide important nutrient subsidies to stream ecosystems. Suckers are restricted from much of their historic spawning range by anthropogenic barriers; my results suggest that restoring connectivity in the Great Lakes Region would restore this important process to a state more closely resembling natural conditions...|$|R
