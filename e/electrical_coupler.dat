40|$|This {{study is}} meant to be an initial study of the {{possibility}} to replace the discrete control signal wires over the <b>electrical</b> <b>coupler</b> between train cars with a data bus system. The {{reason for this is that}} the <b>electrical</b> <b>coupler</b> is large and heavy due to the high amount of contacts it contains. It is also a problem for manufacturers who are upgrading an existing fleet and need to transfer more signals through a coupler with no spare contacts to use. Except the control signals there are also Ethernet and power signals in the <b>electrical</b> <b>coupler.</b> Some trains also use a bus system for control signals and/or signals containing a large amount of data such as passenger information. This report gives a presentation of some common ways to distribute electrical signals throughout a train used by most manufacturers. It also presents some design recommendations for a system that would collect existing signals to a bus system and two different design proposals that should be considered if such a system is to be developed. The study shows that there are already systems on the market for transferringcontrol signals over a bus but they are more aimed for trains under construction. Forthis reason a new bus system would only be suitable for upgrading existing couplersto free up space in the <b>electrical</b> <b>coupler</b> unit...|$|E

5000|$|The 1960 {{stock was}} {{designed}} {{to solve the problems}} of handedness, as extra wires were provided in the <b>electrical</b> <b>couplers</b> to make them fully reversible. Twelve motor cars were ordered and were assembled into six 4-car units, by modifying 2 extra standard stock trailers for each 4-car train. It was expected that these would be the first of 350 motor cars and the same number of converted trailers, for the complete upgrade of the Central Line, but the standard stock was proving to be increasingly unreliable, and there was insufficient time to assess the new prototypes. Instead, 57 trains of newly built 1959 stock were diverted from the Piccadilly line as an interim measure, and increased from seven cars to eight by ordering an extra 57 non-driving motor cars. Many of these were stabled at Hainault depot, until the delivery of 1962 stock, which was virtually identical to the 1959 stock. A total of 87 and a half 8-car trains were ordered, the first entering service on 12 April 1962, and by 17 May 1964, all of the 1959 stock had left the depot and been returned to the Piccadilly Line. The 1962 stock was still handed, with [...] "A" [...] and [...] "D" [...] ends, and so the problems of stabling them and managing them in the depot remained.|$|R
40|$|When two carbon-nanotube coated {{electrodes}} {{are placed}} at small distance from each other, electron field emission from carbon nanotubes allows DC or AC electrical current to flow {{between these two}} electrodes. The voltage drop across these two electrodes depends on the electric field needed for field emission of electrons for carrying the electrical current in the circuit and the distance between these two electrodes. For applications to high-voltage circuits, which operate at much higher voltages than what is needed across two counter electrodes to provide adequate electron field emission current, this device serves as an effective non-contact <b>electrical</b> power <b>coupler.</b> Both rectifying <b>electrical</b> coupling and full-wave electrical coupling have been explored and will be reported in this paper. * Corresponding author'...|$|R
5000|$|He {{was born}} in Elkton, Maryland, on January 17, 1856, and was educated privately at Princeton, New Jersey. His brother, Louis Davidson Ricketts, {{achieved}} prominence as a mining engineer and in finance in New Mexico. Ricketts first arrived at RPI in 1871, at only fifteen years of age. During his junior year, {{he was a member}} of the editorial board which produced one of the more irreverent volumes of the Transit, the school yearbook. Immediately following his graduation in 1875, Ricketts was appointed as Assistant in Mathematics and Astronomy at RPI. He served as an assistant engineer for the Troy and Boston Railroad Company during the summers of 1876 and 1877, and was later elected a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Ricketts was promoted to Assistant Professor in 1882 and in 1884 became the William H. Hart Professor of Rational & Technical Mechanics, the first endowed chair at the Institute. Between 1881 and 1883 Ricketts obtained patents for the invention of an electromagnetic station indicator and a railway-car <b>electrical</b> circuit <b>coupler,</b> and in later years he was vice-president of the Trojan Car Coupler Company. He did research on testing materials, and in 1885 the English journal, Iron, reprinted an article by Ricketts from Van Nostrandâ€™s Engineering Magazine on [...] "Physical Tests of Malleable Cast Iron, with Ten Tables." ...|$|R
