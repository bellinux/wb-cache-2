40|$|Outdoor and <b>Environmental</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Centres</b> provide {{programs}} {{that are designed to}} address a range of <b>environmental</b> <b>education</b> aims, and contribute broadly to student learning for sustainability. This paper examines the roles such Centres can play, and how they might contribute to the Australian Government’s initiative in relation to sustainable schools. Interviews with the principals of 23 such Centres in Queensland revealed three roles or models under which they operate: the destination model; the expert/advisor model; and the partnership model. Principals’ understandings of these roles are discussed and the factors that support or hinder their implementation are identified. It is concluded that while the provision of programs in the environment is still a vital role of outdoor and <b>environmental</b> <b>education</b> <b>centres,</b> these can also be seen as a point of entry to long-term partnerships with whole school communities...|$|R

In the process, it is an exploratory response as to how better the Centres can answer the call of the Reconstruction and Development Programme to "empower all communities to act on environmental issues" (African National Congress 1994 : 40). The research traces the history, the philosophical background and functions of <b>environmental</b> <b>education,</b> of <b>environmental</b> <b>education</b> <b>centres,</b> and of personnel employed at environmental educators, in the ex-Natal Education Department and in its successor, the KZNDEC. The researcher recommends that <b>environmental</b> <b>education</b> <b>centres</b> should become "agents of change" in the wider environment, and in the educational processes, of the communities of which they are a part. The study suggests methods by which people's lives at a "deep rural" level may be improved by helping restore the balance of "the three pillars of sustainable development - economic, social and environmental - and [in the process, having a positive] focus on poverty eradication" (WSSD 2002). The centres, the researcher contends, can become more effective agents of the KZNDEC {{for the protection of the}} environment "for the benefit of present and future generations" (Constitutional Assembly 1996 : 11).

The Phase I of the park has 136,560 plants of 172 indigenous species with about 1,000 name boards with inscriptions of the botanical names. It also includes solar-powered lights, seven water tanks, PVC pipes for a length of 3,100 m, and roads and pathways stretching 4km on the 58-acre campus. The environmental clearance for the Adyar Poonga was obtained from the Union ministry of environment and forests in mid-January 2011. The park was opened to public on 22 January 2011. One fourth of the 58-acre park would be the conservation zone to which public would have no access. A ticket plaza has been built near Brodies Castle Road.|$|E

This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the availability and adequacy of environmental information resources to support field workers at the Wildlife and Environment Society of South Africa's (WESSA) four <b>environmental</b> <b>education</b> <b>centres</b> in KwaZulu-Natal. It begins by examining the environment, the environmental crisis and <b>environmental</b> <b>education</b> {{as a response to the}} crisis, before giving an overview of the history of WESSA. To provide a wider context within which to view the study, literature dealing with <b>environmental</b> <b>education,</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>education</b> <b>centres</b> in South Africa and environmental information was examined. A study population consisting of 18 field workers and eight management staff, based at the four <b>environmental</b> <b>education</b> <b>centres,</b> was surveyed by means of interviews. This allowed for selected attributes such as length of employment at the <b>centre,</b> highest <b>education</b> qualification and previous <b>environmental</b> <b>education</b> experience to be elicited from field workers. Other information asked ofthe population concerned available environmental information resources, the environmental information support required by field workers and the adequacy of this support to field workers. Results were then analysed. With the responses to the open-ended questions, content analysis was used to determine categories which were subsequently tabulated, together with the responses from closed questions. The results revealed that WESSA provides a number of ongoing, in-house training opportunities which expose field workers to environmental information resources; WESSA publications dominate the environmental information resources used during the training offield workers and consequently, during the preparation and conducting of courses by field workers; booklets, books and colleagues are considered valuable information resources by field workers; and there is a recognised lack of environmental information by both field workers and management staff. Recommendations for improving the environmental information resource support to field workers are made in light of the results of the survey and the literature review...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe International Community has {{designated}} the “Sustainable Development” {{as a central}} issue {{for the future of}} humanity. Unesco has named the decade 2005 - 2014 as the decade for the “Education for the Sustainable Development”. It has also engaged with the promotion of this project in order to “…integrate the values and practices of sustainable development to all the forms of education”. The <b>Environmental</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Centres</b> (EEC) were created during the past twenty years and they emerged from the growing interest in the issue of <b>Environmental</b> <b>Education.</b> Of course, the places where EEC are created are places of rich natural resources. The institution of EEC is highly connected to the environmental movement and it is internationally {{considered one of the most}} important factors of extra curriculum <b>education.</b> The <b>Environmental</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Centres</b> are encouraged to cooperate with the citizens in decision-making [2]. They are also encouraged to connect with the lifelong learning, the traditional learning, the local administration and the production units in the appropriate places and with the appropriate members, in order to become an effective structure of Education for Sustainable Development [6]. They can influence the local communities and create an environmental friendly situation. In 2013, at the place Meliti in the prefecture of Florina, an empirical research was carried out in order to explore the role of an Environmental Center in distant areas. The research shows that the operation of <b>Environmental</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Centres</b> influences the students and the local communities, especially when the centre operates in peripheral and disadvantaged areas. The EEC Melitis has a positive impact on the local community. It brings profit to local community, to local businesses (coffee shops, restaurants, ect.), it empowers the local pride, it makes children familiar with the natural and economic identity of their area and with their parents’ professions. Most importantly, the children are being environmentally informed and they can evolve into future protectors of sustainability...|$|R

Thus the dissertation investigation is about whether learning programmes for the Senior Phase learners in Mpumalanga are assessed for their quality, namely, effectiveness and relevancy within the Outcomes-Based Education (OBE) system. Each directorate or section of the Mpumalangas' Department of Agriculture Conservation and Environment is obliged to ensure that appropriate policy guidelines are put in place to assist Environmental Officers (EO' s) to implement the Core Functions of the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Education</b> (EE) Directorate. Sometimes EO's need assistance in implementing policy guidelines. In this investigation EO' s were provided with an opportunity to translate policy into action by participating in the workshops conducted by the researcher. The participation of the EO' s meant that they had to learn how to develop learning programmes that are strongly guided by the EE Directorate's policy guidelines and Core Functions.

40|$|Direct {{experiences}} of nature are becoming less common in our urbanised world and little research exists regarding {{the impact of}} less direct experiences, particularly how childhood reading relates {{to the development of}} pro-environmental values. This study differs from previous reports into the influence of books, as it concentrates on the potential influence of fiction rather than factual or scientific texts. This qualitative study involved semi-structured interviews with 31 educators at Eastern Australian <b>Environmental</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Centres</b> to understand the relationship of childhood reading and value development. Findings reveal that participants: (a) recall predominantly fictional reading material; (b) recall stories by Tolkien, Blyton and Rowling as pro-environmental influences; and (c) commonly exhibit the counter-intuitive influence of fantasy/SF stories in their formative years. Stories will never replace authentic childhood experiences in the natural environment; however, judicious use of appropriate stories could be a valuable teaching strategy as readers often unquestioningly accept information from stories...|$|R

40|$|The {{intensification}} of Ontario’s communities through recent policies {{such as the}} Greater Golden Horseshoe Growth Plan (GGH) will {{reduce the amount of}} local natural spaces for residents. Presently many of Ontario’s youth experience the natural world primarily by visiting <b>environmental</b> <b>education</b> <b>centres.</b> This study used sequential exploratory mixed methods to discover the perceptions of environmental educators concerning the realities of their daily practice. The first phase of the study utilized a grounded theory approach to construct an understanding of <b>environmental</b> <b>education</b> in Ontario. The interrelated themes of increasing environmental consciousness, evaluation of programs and centres, influence of visiting adults on program effectiveness, and programming were revealed. The second phase utilized the themes derived to construct an online survey in order to measure the actual practice of environmental educators compared to their perceived best methods. The results indicate that the scarcity of effective program and institutional evaluation, ineffective communication between supervising adults, and the conflict over pedagogical aims lead to some centres potentially only achieving mediocre increases in the environmental consciousness of the participants. The need for explicit, accessible areas where youth can engage in repetitive unstructured activities in the natural world is highlighted as an area for community stakeholders to focus their efforts on if pro-environmental behaviour is a desired trait in residents...|$|R
