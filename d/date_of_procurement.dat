40|$|Purchasing {{function}} is, {{along with}} a sale, {{one of the most}} important functions of every commercial (trading) company. Management <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> is related to selection and number of suppliers, policy relations with them, setting <b>of</b> purchasing (<b>procurement)</b> quotas as well as to methods and types of payments. The role <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> in relations between suppliers and buyers has been changing with market developments. Purchasing is no longer just a passive function for selecting the best suppliers to send orders to, but it establishes partnership relations with suppliers. The objectives <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> function, among others, are timely and safe delivery, professional relationships with suppliers, product quality, inventory optimization and cost reduction. Due to strong competitive pressures in the markets where they operate that limit the possibility of significant influence on individual forming of selling prices of goods and services, commercial (trading) companies are forced to find appropriate methods to reduce their operating costs. One of the business areas where a company can realize cost reductions is <b>procurement.</b> The complexity <b>of</b> business operations and market relations are influencing the value <b>of</b> costs <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> <b>of</b> goods and services that represent a significant share in the sales value of commercial companies. In order to reduce and control procurement costs, enterprises must develop and implement appropriate cost management systems. Reducing procurement costs can be achieved in two key areas, namely in the area <b>of</b> prices <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> objects and in the area of cost reduction <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> function. Traditional approach <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> cost management, which is oriented on management <b>of</b> prices <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> objects and for which needed information is supplied by financial accounting, is not suitable to actual needs of the enterprises. Therefore, it is necessary to develop appropriate contemporary cost management models that are based on information of management accounting and, in general, of management information systems, in order to increase the profitability <b>of</b> commercial enterprises. <b>procurement</b> function, purchasing costs, management of purchasing costs...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the economic characteristics <b>of</b> construction <b>procurement</b> systems partially {{in terms of}} transaction cost economics and partly those of project management. It proposes the theoretical principle of an inconsistent trinity, according to which, in selecting a procurement system, the client will inevitably face a trade-off between the procurement system best able to deliver: (1) fastest completion of the project (and therefore higher discounted present value of revenue from the project); (2) least vulnerability when making changes (lower transaction hold-up costs arising from temporal or process specificity); as well as (3) least vulnerability to non-performance (lower transaction measurement costs from greater visibility to third parties for ordering of disputes). The model provides a potentially testable contribution to a transaction cost theory <b>of</b> construction <b>procurement.</b> It also has two implications: (1) the three main family types <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> systems are held to be intrinsically different in economic terms, so selection <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> system does matter; (2) no system can enjoy absolute advantage over others, so the proposed strategy <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> system selection is to align the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> systems with attributes of projects.

It investigated and explored the issues and barriers to effective implementation <b>of</b> different <b>procurement</b> methods that the organisations used, the environment and its suitability for implementing different forms <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> in context <b>of</b> public sector in Pakistan and the relationship it had to successful project outcomes. The research {{was carried out in}} two stages. In the first stage archival analysis was conducted of government documents, reports including reports by international organisations, policy documents and literature. As a result of this it was found that there are two different methods <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> used for procuring infrastructure projects in public sector in Pakistan i. e. the traditional method for example competitive design-bid-build and the non-traditional method for example Public-Private-Partnership (PPP). During the second stage case studies were selected based on archival analysis. A total of 6 public sector organisations had been selected as organisational case studies and 8 projects had been selected among these organisations as project case studies. Out of the 6 organisations 5 were federal government and 1 provincial government organisation. The organisational coverage of sub-sectors of infrastructure includes transport, water and power sub-sectors. Geographically the organisations and projects covered all four provinces and tribal areas as well as the state of Azad and Jammu Kashmir. Projects were selected on the basis <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> method. Out <b>of</b> the total 8, 3 of the projects were on Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT), 2 projects on Build-Own-Operate (BOO), 1 project on Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) (only BOOT project in Pakistan) and 2 projects on traditional method <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> were selected. A total of 24 respondents participated from these 6 organisations. The case studies were analysed using qualitative content analysis techniques of the in depth interviews. Cross case analysis had also been carried out based on looking at the similarities and differences across similar as well as different methods <b>of</b> <b>procurement.</b> As a result multiple issues have been identified which affected the choice <b>of</b> <b>procurement.</b> The barriers and constraints to implementation <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> have also been described in detail. It was reported that the procurement practice had a direct impact on successful project outcomes in case of public sector infrastructure projects in Pakistan.
