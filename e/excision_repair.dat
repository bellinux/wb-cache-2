5|$|There are two types: {{nucleotide}} <b>excision</b> <b>repair</b> {{and base}} <b>excision</b> <b>repair.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{only one}} of the two strands of a double helix has a defect, the other strand {{can be used as a}} {{template}} to guide the correction of the damaged strand. In order to repair damage to one of the two paired molecules of DNA, there exist a number of <b>excision</b> <b>repair</b> mechanisms that remove the damaged nucleotide and replace it with an undamaged nucleotide complementary to that found in the undamaged DNA strand.|$|E
5|$|Cells {{are known}} to {{eliminate}} three types of damage to their DNA by chemically reversing it. These mechanisms do not require a template, since the types of damage they counteract can occur in {{only one of the}} four bases. Such direct reversal mechanisms are specific to the type of damage incurred and do not involve breakage of the phosphodiester backbone. The formation of pyrimidine dimers upon irradiation with UV light results in an abnormal covalent bond between adjacent pyrimidine bases. The photoreactivation process directly reverses this damage by the action of the enzyme photolyase, whose activation is obligately dependent on energy absorbed from blue/UV light (300–500nm wavelength) to promote catalysis. Photolyase, an old enzyme present in bacteria, fungi, and most animals no longer functions in humans, who instead use nucleotide <b>excision</b> <b>repair</b> to repair damage from UV irradiation. Another type of damage, methylation of guanine bases, is directly reversed by the protein methyl guanine methyl transferase (MGMT), the bacterial equivalent of which is called ogt. This is an expensive process because each MGMT molecule can be used only once; that is, the reaction is stoichiometric rather than catalytic. A generalized response to methylating agents in bacteria is known as the adaptive response and confers a level of resistance to alkylating agents upon sustained exposure by upregulation of alkylation repair enzymes. The third type of DNA damage reversed by cells is certain methylation of the bases cytosine and adenine.|$|E
50|$|Polymorphisms {{have been}} {{discovered}} in multiple XPD exons. XPD refers to ‘’’xeroderma pigmentosum group D’’’ that are needed for <b>excision</b> <b>repairs</b> of bulky cuts in the DNA, which are mostly produced by smoking. Asp312Asn and Lys751Gln are the two polymorphisms that are consequence in conversions in an amino acid. Alternation in Asn and Gln alleles is stated to having a role in reducing the repair efficiency in humans {{that leads to a}} risk of lung cancer.|$|R
40|$|AbstractPCNA autoantibodies {{specific}} for cyclin/PCNA {{were used}} to determine the nuclear distribution of this protein in transformed human amnion cells (AMA) irradiated with ultraviolet light (254 nm) under conditions that induced nucleotide <b>excision</b> DNA <b>repair</b> synthesis. The results showed a striking increase in nuclear cyclin/PCNA antigen staining of non S-phase cells that was not abolished by cycloheximide (20 μg/ml, added 2 h before irradiation), and that is most likely due to a redistribution of pre-existing cyclin. These observations raise the possibility that cyclin/PCNA {{may play a role in}} nucleotide <b>excision</b> DNA <b>repair</b> synthesis in addition to its putative role in replicative DNA synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Human {{lymphocytes}} sonicated {{in vitro}} with pulsed ultrasounds {{of the same}} frequency and intensity as those used far diagnostic purposes appear to cause {{two different types of}} damage of DNA molecules. One can be repaired within a short time (60 minutes) and involves single strand breaking. The other one requires a longer time far repair (20 to 24 hours) and appears to be due to the formation of large <b>excision</b> <b>repairs</b> leading to Sister Chromatid Exchange (SCE). A spectrofluorimetric method evidencing these two types of damage is described. Electrophoretic anomalies of damaged molecules are shown. along with morphological ones, by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) ...|$|R
25|$|Nucleotide <b>excision</b> <b>repair</b> is a DNA repair mechanism. There {{are three}} <b>excision</b> <b>repair</b> pathways: {{nucleotide}} <b>excision</b> <b>repair</b> (NER), base <b>excision</b> <b>repair</b> (BER), and DNA mismatch repair (MMR). In NER, the damaged DNA strand is removed and the undamaged strand is kept as {{a template for}} the formation of a complementary sequence with DNA polymerase. DNA ligase joins the strands together to form dsDNA. There are two subpathways for NER, which differ only in their mechanism for recognition: global genomic NER (GG-NER) and transcription coupled NER (TC-NER).|$|E
25|$|Epigenetic {{alterations}} (epimutations) in base <b>excision</b> <b>repair</b> genes {{have only}} recently begun to be evaluated in a few cancers, compared to the numerous previous studies of epimutations in genes acting in other DNA repair pathways (such as MLH1 in mismatch repair and MGMT in direct reversal). Some examples of epimutations in base <b>excision</b> <b>repair</b> genes that occur in cancers are summarized below.|$|E

30|$|Discussion: Uterine sacculation {{syndrome}} (Kent and Waters 2009) is {{an increasingly}} common but generally unrecognised phenomeneon. The key is suspicion {{based on the}} diagnostic triad. Diagnosis is by hysterecoscpy. Treatment options can be medical or surgical, be it hysterectomy or laparoscopic <b>excision</b> and <b>repair.</b>|$|R
40|$|DNA {{mismatch}} repair (MMR) {{is a critical}} genome-stabilization system. However, the molecular mechanism of MMR in human cells remains obscure {{because many of the}} components have not yet been identified. Using a functional in vitro reconstitution system, this study identified three HeLa cell fractions essential for in vitro MMR. These fractions divide human MMR into two distinct stages: mismatch-provoked <b>excision</b> and <b>repair</b> synthesis. In vitro dissection of the MMR reaction and crucial intermediates elucidated biochemical functions of individual fractions in human MMR and identified hitherto unknown functions of human replication protein A (hRPA) in MMR. Thus, one fraction carries out nick-directed and mismatch-dependent excision; the second carries out DNA repair synthesis and DNA ligation; and the third provides hRPA, which plays multiple roles in human MMR by protecting the template DNA strand from degradation, enhancing <b>repair</b> <b>excision,</b> and facilitating <b>repair</b> synthesis. It is anticipated that further analysis of these fractions will identify additional MMR components and enable the complete reconstitution of the human MMR pathway with purified proteins...|$|R

25|$|The {{nucleotide}} <b>excision</b> <b>repair</b> (NER) pathway is {{a mechanism}} to repair damage to DNA. ERCC2 is involved in transcription-coupled NER and is an integral member of the basal transcription factor BTF2/TFIIH complex. ERCC3 is an ATP-dependent DNA helicase that functions in NER. It also is a subunit of basal transcription factor 2 (TFIIH) and, thus, functions in class II transcription. XPG (ERCC5) forms a stable complex with TFIIH, which is active in transcription and NER. ERCC6 encodes a DNA-binding protein that is important in transcription-coupled <b>excision</b> <b>repair.</b> ERCC8 interacts with Cockayne syndrome type B (CSB) protein, with p44 (GTF2H2), a subunit of the RNA polymerase II transcription factor IIH, and ERCC6. It is involved in transcription-coupled <b>excision</b> <b>repair.</b>|$|E
25|$|Inhibition of DNA repair {{processes}} {{is considered}} one of main mechanism of inorganic arsenic genotoxicity. Nucleotide <b>excision</b> <b>repair</b> (NER) and base <b>excision</b> <b>repair</b> (BER) are the processes implicated in the repair of DNA base damage induced by ROS after arsenic exposure. In particular, the NER mechanism is the major pathway for repairing bulky distortions in DNA double helix, while the BER mechanism is mainly implicated in the repair of single strand breaks induced by ROS, but inorganic arsenic could also repress the BER mechanism.|$|E

40|$|The {{excision}} of pyrimidine dimers from the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of Neurospora crassa was examined. Postirradiation incubation {{in the presence}} of several chemicals known to inhibit various repair systems indicated that caffeine reduced the rate of excision twofold, but did not inhibit excision completely as did proflavine and quinacrine. Examination of the time course of <b>excision</b> showed that <b>repair</b> occurs at a relatively rapid rate: approximately 60 dimers excised per min after 500 ergs/mm 2. Further evidence for rapid excision was obtained by sedimentation analysis of DNA; the maximal number of breaks introduced during repair was three, suggesting that breaks are repaired almost as fast as they are made and that only a few dimers are repaired at a time. Repair synthesis was measured by prelabeling the DNA with 15 N and D 2 O, and then subjecting the DNA to equilibrium density gradient centrifugation after postirradiation incubation with 32 P. Accumulation of single-strand breaks with increasing dose of ultraviolet radiation suggested that the limiting step was subsequent to the incision and <b>excision</b> steps of <b>repair.</b> Equilibrium CsCl centrifugation demonstrated that the limiting step in <b>excision</b> was <b>repair</b> synthesis...|$|R

25|$|During {{nucleotide}} <b>excision</b> <b>repair,</b> several protein complexes cooperate {{to recognize}} damaged DNA and locally separate the DNA helix {{for a short}} distance {{on either side of}} the site of a site of DNA damage. The ERCC1–XPF nuclease incises the damaged DNA strand on the 5′ side of the lesion. During NER, the ERCC1 protein interacts with the XPA protein to coordinate DNA and protein binding.|$|E
25|$|UVB photons {{can cause}} direct DNA damage. UVB {{radiation}} excites DNA molecules in skin cells, causing aberrant covalent bonds to form between adjacent pyrimidine bases, producing a dimer. Most UV-induced pyrimidine dimers in DNA are removed {{by the process}} known as nucleotide <b>excision</b> <b>repair</b> that employs about 30 different proteins. Those pyrimidine dimers that escape this repair process can induce a form of programmed cell death (apoptosis) or can cause DNA replication errors leading to mutation.|$|E

25|$|MUTYH encodes DNA {{repair enzyme}} MYH glycosylase. During normal {{cellular}} activities, guanine sometimes becomes altered by oxygen, which causes it to pair with adenine instead of cytosine. MYH glycosylase fixes these mistakes by base <b>excision</b> <b>repair,</b> such that mutations do not accumulate in the DNA {{and lead to}} tumor formation. When MYH glycosylase does not function correctly, DNA errors may accrue to initiate tumorigenesis with a clinical presentation {{similar to that in}} patients with APC mutations.|$|E
25|$|Most notable {{among the}} changes in DNA are the 1,2-intrastrand cross-links with purine bases. These include 1,2-intrastrand d(GpG) adducts which form nearly 90% of the adducts and the less common 1,2-intrastrand d(ApG) adducts. 1,3-intrastrand d(GpXpG) adducts occur but are readily excised by the {{nucleotide}} <b>excision</b> <b>repair</b> (NER). Other adducts include inter-strand crosslinks and nonfunctional adducts that have been postulated to contribute to cisplatin's activity. Interaction with cellular proteins, particularly HMG domain proteins, has also been advanced as a mechanism of interfering with mitosis, although this is probably not its primary method of action.|$|E
25|$|TFIIH {{enters the}} complex. TFIIH {{is a large}} protein complex that {{contains}} among others the CDK7/cyclin H kinase complex and a DNA helicase. TFIIH has three functions: It binds specifically to the template strand {{to ensure that the}} correct strand of DNA is transcribed and melts or unwinds the DNA (ATP-dependent) to separate the two strands using its helicase activity. It has a kinase activity that phosphorylates the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II at the amino acid serine. This switches the RNA polymerase to start producing RNA. Finally it is essential for Nucleotide <b>Excision</b> <b>Repair</b> (NER) of damaged DNA. TFIIH and TFIIE strongly interact with one another. TFIIE affects TFIIH’s catalytic activity. Without TFIIE, TFIIH will not unwind the promoter.|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} ofmalignant tumors of {{the upper}} gastrointestinal tract and liver is, based largely on epidemiological evidence, causally related to the consumption of ethanol. It is widely recog-nized that oxidants {{play a key role}} in alcohol-induced liver injury; however, it is unclear how oxidants may be involved in DNA damage. We asked whether nicotinamide adenine dinucle-otide phosphate oxidase, cytochrome P 450 CYP 2 E 1, or both are responsible for the production ofDNAdamage. The rodentTsukamoto-Frenchmodel of intragastric ethanol infusionwasused. Wistar rats, Cyp 2 e 1 -, p 47 phox-null, and hCyp 2 e 1 transgenic mice were used. The abundance of oxidative DNA adducts, mutagenic apurinic/apyrimidinic sites, and expression of base <b>excision</b> DNA <b>repair</b> genes was determined. In rats and wild-typemice, ethanol treatment for 4 weeks led to an increase in oxidative DNA damage and induction of expression of the base <b>excision</b> DNA <b>repair</b> genes that are known to remove oxidative DNA lesions. No increase in either of the endpointswas observed in ethanol-treatedCyp 2 e 1 -nullmice, whereas themagnitude of response in p 47 phox-null mice and transgenic hCyp 2 e 1 was identical to that in wild types.

25|$|The {{evolution}} of early reproductive proteins and enzymes is attributed in modern models of evolutionary theory to ultraviolet radiation. UVB causes thymine base pairs {{next to each}} other in genetic sequences to bond together into thymine dimers, a disruption in the strand that reproductive enzymes cannot copy. This leads to frameshifting during genetic replication and protein synthesis, usually killing the cell. Before formation of the UV-blocking ozone layer, when early prokaryotes approached the surface of the ocean, they almost invariably died out. The few that survived had developed enzymes that monitored the genetic material and removed thymine dimers by nucleotide <b>excision</b> <b>repair</b> enzymes. Many enzymes and proteins involved in modern mitosis and meiosis are similar to repair enzymes, and are believed to be evolved modifications of the enzymes originally used to overcome DNA damages caused by UV.|$|E
