5|$|Robert Russell as John Stearne. Playing Hopkins's thuggish assistant, Russell {{certainly}} {{looked the}} part. However, as filming progressed, Reeves found the actor's high-pitched voice unsuitable {{for such a}} rough character, and after production was completed <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> of his dialogue dubbed by another actor, Jack Lynn (who also appeared in a small role as an innkeeper).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, two {{separate}} embassies had been dispatched to Tyre {{to appeal to}} Ummidius Caius Quadratus, who as legate of Syria had some authority over the lower-ranking procurator of Iudaea. One, from the Samaritans, protested the Jewish attacks on Samaritan villages. The Jewish counter-embassy held the Samaritans responsible for the violence and accused Cumanus of siding with them. Agreeing to investigate, Quadratus proceeded in 52 to Iudaea, where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> of Cumanus' Jewish prisoners crucified and ordered the beheading of several other Jews and Samaritans who {{had been involved in}} the fighting.|$|E
5|$|Legend {{goes that}} Tulsidas was born after {{staying in the}} womb for twelve months, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> thirty two teeth in his mouth at birth, his health and looks were {{like that of a}} five-year-old boy, and he did not cry {{at the time of his}} birth but uttered Rama instead. He was {{therefore}} named Rambola (literally, he who uttered Rama), as Tulsidas himself states in Vinaya Patrika. As per the Mula Gosain Charita, he was born under the Abhuktamūla constellation, which according to Jyotisha (Hindu astrology) causes immediate danger to the life of the father. Due to the inauspicious events at the time of his birth, he was abandoned by his parents on the fourth night, sent away with Chuniya (some sources call her Muniya), a female servant of Hulsi. In his works Kavitavali and Vinayapatrika, Tulsidas attests to his parents abandoning him after birth due to an inauspicious astrological configuration.|$|E

5|$|Link, {{who is the}} {{apprentice}} of a blacksmith, goes to deliver a sword to a captain at Hyrule Castle, only to encounter a mysterious figure named Yuga, who transforms a descendant of a Sage, Seres, into a painting. After being knocked out during the fight, Link is found by a merchant named Ravio, who gives him a bracelet in exchange for being allowed to stay in his home, and tells him to report {{what had happened to}} Princess Zelda. After going to Hyrule Castle, Zelda gives Link the Pendant of Courage and instructs him to seek out the pendants of Power and Wisdom in order to gain the power of the Master Sword. Along the way, Link encounters Yuga again and is turned into a painting himself. However, thanks to Ravio's bracelet, Link is protected from Yuga's spell and gains the ability to merge with walls and move around as a painting. After finding the other pendants and obtaining the Master Sword, Link returns to Hyrule Castle where he witnesses Yuga transform Zelda into a painting. Link pursues Yuga through a dimensional crack, arriving in the twisted decaying kingdom of Lorule. There, Yuga uses Zelda and the descendants of the Seven Sages, who <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> trapped inside paintings, to revive Ganon and fuse with him, obtaining the Triforce of Power in the process. Just then, Link is assisted by Princess Hilda, the ruler of Lorule, who traps Yuga in magic bonds.|$|E

25|$|The filming {{schedule}} {{consisted of}} fifty one days with thirty-two full nights of shooting in downtown Los Angeles. The shooting schedule presented difficulties for the director {{due to the}} schedule of the star Shaquille O'Neal. O'Neal was already committed for playing in the 1996 Summer Olympics, and training at the Los Angeles Lakers camp in Hawaii. This left Johnson with five weeks to complete filming all scenes with O'Neal. O'Neal had one read through of the script before the Olympics and then worked with acting coach Ben Martin in between games {{to work on his}} character. When O'Neal returned to act {{with the rest of the}} cast, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> his lines memorized.|$|E
25|$|Bhishma was an invincible warrior. He {{was also}} a highly skilled in {{political}} science. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> the qualities and abilities for an excellent king. His goodness and sacrifice {{made him one of}} the greatest devotees of Lord Krishna himself. He tried his best to bring reconciliation between the Pandavas and Kauravas to prevent the war. Even in the Kurukshetra war, while he was the general, he tried his best to keep the war low key by minimizing confrontation between the two camps. Even as he fell he tried to use the opportunity to persuade both camps to put an end to the war. Bhishma was a complete human, a complete warrior and a complete teacher (acharya), hence he was known as Bhishmacharya.|$|E

Tom and Michelle Billington's three children, Bronwyne, Marek and Amaris are also often included {{in the list of}} his grandchildren, therefore Bronwyne's daughter Miami is also often referred to as one of his great-grandchildren.

25|$|The Irish Confederates had pinned {{their hopes}} on Royalist {{victory in the}} Wars of the Three Kingdoms, {{so that they could}} cite their loyalty to Charles I and force him into {{accepting}} their demands – including toleration for Catholicism, Irish self-government, and an end to the Plantation policy. But, Charles' Royalists were defeated in the English Civil War by the Parliamentarians, who committed themselves to re-conquering Ireland and punishing those responsible for the rebellion of 1641. In 1649, Cromwell landed in Ireland with his New Model Army and by 1652, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> but completed the conquest. The English Parliament published punitive terms of surrender for Catholics and Royalists in Ireland, which included the mass confiscation of all Catholic-owned land.|$|E
25|$|Odysseus {{was curious}} {{as to what the}} Sirens sang to him, and so, on the advice of Circe, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> of his sailors plug their ears with beeswax and tie him to the mast. He ordered his men to leave him tied tightly to the mast, no matter how much he would beg. When he heard their {{beautiful}} song, he ordered the sailors to untie him but they bound him tighter. When they had passed out of earshot, Odysseus demonstrated with his frowns to be released. Some post-Homeric authors state that the Sirens were fated to die if someone heard their singing and escaped them, and that after Odysseus passed by they therefore flung themselves into the water and perished.|$|E
25|$|When {{his brother}} Napoleon Bonaparte annexed the Kingdom of Holland into the French Empire in 1810, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> local {{government}} radically reformed to become compatible with French structures. Ommen too was affected: the separate jurisdictions of Stad Ommen (composed {{of the city}} of Ommen and the Ommerschans) and Ambt Ommen (which comprised {{most of the rest of}} the current municipality, Avereest and Den Ham as well) were merged into one Mairie Ommen (though Den Ham became a separate municipality). This caused much controversy and discontent locally because the marke communities thus lost their ancient rights of self-governance. In 1818, shortly after Dutch independence, Mairie Ommen was once more decentralised into the municipalities Stad Ommen, Ambt Ommen and Avereest. To ensure good coordination, one burgomaster was appointed over both Stad and Ambt from 1851 onwards.|$|E

25|$|The first {{large-scale}} {{operation was}} to dredge the lakes and other water features. 320,000 tonnes of silt {{had to be}} removed. The wall of the ha-ha had largely collapsed {{and had to be}} rebuilt by hand. It was also found that very few trees survived before the 3rd Duke's time; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> the mature trees felled to sell for their timber in order to raise cash. There had been a few plantings of commercial softwood, including a spruce plantation {{on the site of the}} Saxon Deities (largely by John Michael Rysbrack placed 1728-1730). These were felled. Further thinning was carried out, including reopening views between the various buildings and monuments. Replanting of 20,000 trees and shrubs followed, using species present in the original garden. Paths which had become overgrown were re-excavated and eventually covered in gravel from local pits.|$|E
25|$|During Stalin's Great Purge in 1937, Berestov fell {{afoul of}} the NKVD and was arrested. In {{the course of his}} {{interrogation}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> his front teeth smashed out, all of his toes were broken, and he also suffered a broken rib. In 1939 he was released and rehabilitated, having been vouched for by Gen. S.K. Timoshenko. After his release, in August, 1939, he became head of supply in the newly formed 168th Rifle Division. In December he took command of the 402nd Rifle Regiment in that same division. Wounded in late February, 1940, during the Winter War, he continued in command and was soon awarded his first of four Orders of the Red Banner. On 5 March he was promoted to Colonel. After {{the end of the war}} Berestov was sent to the Vystrel courses, from which he graduated in June 1941.|$|E
25|$|Zachara's {{music is}} mostly {{written in a}} Romantic vein, {{and most of his}} piano music follows in the {{footsteps}} of his countryman, Frédéric Chopin (1810-1849). Zachara was an expert in the music of Chopin, and it is said that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> of Chopin's music memorized. He occasionally did transcriptions of the music of other composers, including Chopin, Liszt, Strauss, and others. Partial scores of transcriptions exist of Chopin’s ‘Butterfly’ Etude (Op. 25 No. 9) for piano solo, and two-piano versions of Chopin’s Etude Op. 25 No. 9, and ‘Minute Waltz’ (Op. 64 No. 1). Zachara had used his own opus numbering system earlier in his career, extending at least to his piano sonatas (opus numbers 80 and 81) but this system seems to have been abandoned by the early 1950s. The list of works below reflects original opus numbers assigned by Zachara. A new system of assigning notation to all of Zachara’s works, whether completely or partially existing, is currently being created (2008).|$|E
