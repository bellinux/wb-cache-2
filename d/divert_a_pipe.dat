30|$|In the {{trajectory}} method, all the flow in <b>a</b> stream is <b>diverted</b> into <b>a</b> <b>pipe</b> (Yan 1996; Hudson 2004; Salguero et al. 2008). Flow from <b>a</b> horizontal <b>pipe</b> {{can be estimated}} using either the California pipe method developed by van Leer (1924) or {{the trajectory}} method developed by Greeve (1928). This flow measurement technique is based on measuring brink depth {{at the end of}} the pipe (Berkowitz 2013). The diverted water is discharged with pressure so that the rate of flow can be estimated from measurements of the jet (Rohwer 1943; Boman and Shukla 2009). At least two measurements of the discharging jet are required to calculate the rate of flow of the water (Yan 1996; Liu et al. 2014). The method provides reasonably accurate values of discharge only for certain ranges of size and flow conditions and can be applied to streams where discharge can be <b>diverted</b> through <b>a</b> <b>pipe</b> (Hudson 1993; Boman and Shukla 2009). This method can be adapted for the measurement of discharge in small open channels where flow can be directed to <b>a</b> <b>pipe</b> (Liu et al. 2014). This method needs trained man power and involves complicated calculations (Boman and Shukla 2009).|$|R
5000|$|There are {{safety valves}} known as PSV's {{and can be}} {{connected}} to pressure gauges (usually with a 1/2" [...] BSP fitting). These allow a resistance of pressure {{to be applied to}} limit the pressure forced on the gauge tube, resulting in prevention of over pressurisation. the matter that has been injected into the gauge, if over pressurised, will be <b>diverted</b> through <b>a</b> <b>pipe</b> in the safety valve, and shall be driven away from the gauge.|$|R
50|$|In {{urban design}} and urban planning, {{daylighting}} is the redirection {{of a stream}} into an above-ground channel. Typically, {{the goal is to}} restore a stream of water to a more natural state. Daylighting is intended to improve the riparian environment for a stream which had been previously <b>diverted</b> into <b>a</b> culvert, <b>pipe,</b> or <b>a</b> drainage system. In the UK, the practice is also known as deculverting.|$|R
30|$|The {{electromagnetic}} method measures point {{velocity of}} a stream by using an electromagnetic meter. Continuous records of velocity {{at one point in}} a cross section and of the stage readings are used to calculate the stream discharge records (Egusa et al. 2013). This method works according to Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction, the motion of water flowing in a stream cuts the vertical component of the earth’s magnetic field and an electromotive force (EMF) is induced in the water. This EMF can be sensed by electrodes (‘probes’) {{on each side of the}} stream and is found to be directly proportional to the average velocity of flow in the cross section (Herschy 2008). This method gives accurate results but special training is needed to use the probes (Ryckborst and Christie 1977; Van Gent et al. 2008). Electromagnetic method gives reliable results only for streams where all the flow can be <b>diverted</b> into <b>a</b> <b>pipe</b> (Herschy 2008).|$|R
5000|$|The 2016 Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid car {{features}} an Exhaust Gas Heat Recovery (EGHR) system to accelerate coolant heat up time. This gives faster heat {{up of the}} engine coolant which in turn heats up the engine faster. Less choke is used giving reduced emissions and fuel consumption. This will also quicken cabin heating warm up for passenger comfort and window defrosting. For hybrid applications it also can warm the battery pack. The cooling system is connected to a heat exchanger placed in the exhaust gas transferring the thermal energy from the exhaust gas to the cooling system. When the engine is warmed up the exhaust gas is <b>diverted</b> to <b>a</b> by-pass <b>pipe.</b> http://gmauthority.com/blog/2015/04/2016-chevrolet-malibu-hybrid-exhaust-gas-heat-recovery-feature-spotlight/ ...|$|R
40|$|A slurry system draws slurry from a {{slurry tank}} via {{one of several}} intake pipes, where each <b>pipe</b> has <b>an</b> intake opening at a {{different}} depth in the slurry. The slurry is returned to the slurry tank via <b>a</b> bypass <b>pipe</b> {{in order to continue}} the agitation of the slurry. The slurry is then <b>diverted</b> to <b>a</b> delivery <b>pipe,</b> which supplies slurry to a polisher. The flow of shiny in the bypass pipe is stopped in order for the slurry in the slurry tank to begin to settle. As the polishing continues, slurry is removed from shallower depths in order to pull finer grit from the slurry. When the polishing is complete, the flow in the delivery pipe is ceased. The flow of slurry in the bypass pipe is resumed to start agitating the slurry. In another embodiment, the multiple intake pipes are replaced by <b>a</b> single adjustable <b>pipe.</b> <b>As</b> the slurry is settling, the pipe is moved upward to remove the finer grit {{near the top of the}} slurry tank as the polishing process continues...|$|R

The critical value of the fluid velocity at which the straight position of <b>a</b> <b>pipe</b> loses its stability is called critical flow velocity.
