5|$|In technology, medicine, and mathematics, ancient Egypt {{achieved}} a relatively <b>high</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> productivity and sophistication. Traditional empiricism, {{as evidenced by}} the Edwin Smith and Ebers papyri (c. 1600BC), is first credited to Egypt. The Egyptians created their own alphabet and decimal system.|$|E
5|$|Ballistics was {{the first}} game {{developed}} at Grin. Careful planning and production methods enabled a very quick completion time of 6 months; the game was finished before even acquiring a distribution partner. Grin used TQM methods to ensure a <b>high</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> work, and JIT techniques to ensure the timing of different production phases came together.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, the {{orchestra}} became {{renowned for its}} <b>high</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> playing and for performing new and unfamiliar music. The pioneering work of Boult and the BBC SO included an early performance of Schoenberg's Variations, Op. 31, British premieres, including Berg's Wozzeck and Three Movements from the Lyric Suite, and world premieres, including Vaughan Williams's Symphony No. 4 in F minor. Anton Webern conducted eight BBC SO concerts between 1931 and 1936.|$|E

5|$|Broke drilled {{his crew}} to an {{extremely}} <b>high</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> naval gunnery; he regularly had them fire at targets, such as floating barrels. Often these drills {{would be made}} into competitions to see which gun crew could hit the target and how fast they could do so. He even had his gun crews fire at targets 'blindfold' to good effect; they were only given the bearing to lay their gun on without being allowed to sight the gun on the target themselves. This constituted a very early example of 'director firing'.|$|E
5|$|Gabon gained its {{independence}} from France on 17 August 1960. The country had a relatively <b>high</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> living and {{was considered one of}} the more stable countries in West Africa, both politically and economically. At the time of the coup, the country had an estimated US$200 average annual income {{and was one of the}} few countries in Africa with a positive trade balance, with exports exceeding imports by 30 percent. As of 1964, the country was among the largest producers of uranium and manganese in French Africa, which Time suggested was one of the reasons for France's response to the coup. It also had petroleum, iron, and logging interests stationed in Gabon.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to their British counterparts, the French Navy {{was in a}} state of confusion. Although the quality of the fleet's ships was high, the fleet hierarchy was riven by the same crises that had torn through France since the Revolution five years earlier. Consequently, the <b>high</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> ships and ordnance was not matched by that of the available crews, which were largely untrained and inexperienced. With the Terror resulting in the death or dismissal of many senior French sailors and officers, political appointees and conscripts – many of whom had never been to sea at all, let alone in a fighting vessel – filled the Atlantic fleet.|$|E

5|$|The Antiquary {{was printed}} at Mazgaon, Bombay, by the Bombay Education Society {{and later the}} British India Press, but {{illustrations}} were produced in London by the firm of Griggs who were known for the accuracy of their work. A <b>high</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> reproduction was essential so that scholars could work on the epigraphic material without needing to see the originals. Illustrations in the Antiquary were used by scholars such as Bhandarkar, Bhagvanlal Indraji, Georg Bühler, John Faithfull Fleet, Eggeling and B. Lewis Rice to decipher important inscriptions, {{and in many cases}} their translations remain the definitive versions to this day.|$|E

His Winchester school {{played an important role}} in creating the standard vernacular West Saxon literary language, and his pupil Ælfric was its most eminent writer.|$|E

5|$|The sets {{representing}} the interior {{rooms of the}} Titanic were reproduced exactly as originally built, using photographs and plans from the Titanic builders. The Grand Staircase, which features prominently in the film, was recreated to a <b>high</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> authenticity, though it was widened 30% compared to the original and reinforced with steel girders. Craftsmen from Mexico and Britain sculpted the ornate paneling and plaster-work based on Titanic's original designs. The carpeting, upholstery, individual pieces of furniture, light fixtures, chairs, cutlery and crockery with the White Star Line crest on each piece were among the objects recreated according to original designs. Cameron additionally hired two Titanic historians, Don Lynch and Ken Marschall, to authenticate the historical detail in the film.|$|E
