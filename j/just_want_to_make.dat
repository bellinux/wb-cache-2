"Hoochie Coochie Man" [...] {{represents}} Waters' recording {{transition from}} an electrified, but more traditional Delta-based blues {{of the late}} 1940s–early 1950s to a newer Chicago blues ensemble sound. [...] The song was important to Dixon's career and signaled a change as well – Chess became convinced of Dixon's value as a songwriter and secured his relationship as such with the label. [...] Waters soon followed up with several variations on the sixteen-bar stop-time arrangement written by Dixon. [...] These include [...] "I <b>Just</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Make</b> Love to You", [...] "I'm Ready", and [...] "I'm a Natural Born Lover".

500|$|In {{the weeks}} {{following}} Irwin's death, {{at least ten}} stingrays were found dead and mutilated on the beaches of Queensland, with their tails cut off, prompting speculation {{as to whether they}} might have been killed by fans of Irwin as an act of revenge, although, according to the chairman of the Queensland fishing information service, anglers regularly cut the tails off of accidentally caught stingrays to avoid being stung. Michael Hornby, a friend of Irwin and executive director of his Wildlife Warrior fund, condemned any revenge killings, saying that [...] "We <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it very clear that we will not accept and not stand for anyone who's taken a form of retribution.

During an interview with Essence, LaBelle said that she was first introduced to R music after her parents emigrated from Bulgaria to the United States. She recounted that she was initially discouraged from pursuing a career in the genre, but later said that she was not concerned with [...] "the clichés surrounding white artists singing R". She followed this up saying: [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> good music. I'm here and I'm doing what I love and the music that I love. It's going to reach who it's supposed to reach." [...] LaBelle was identified as a blue-eyed soul singer by Essence.|$|E

2500|$|..... I {{do think}} the Internet’s under much greater attack {{than it has been}} in the past.

2500|$|By {{the time}} Beggars Banquet was released, the Rolling Stones had already raised some hackles for sexually forward lyrics such as [...] "Let's Spend the Night Together", or after their reprise of the Willie Dixon's blues [...] "I <b>Just</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Make</b> Love to You" [...] etc. and for {{allegedly}} dabbling in Satanism (their previous album, while containing no direct Satanic references in its music or lyrics, was titled Their Satanic Majesties Request), and [...] "Sympathy" [...] brought these concerns to the fore, provoking media rumours and fears among some religious groups that the Stones were devil-worshippers and a corrupting influence on youth.|$|E

2500|$|The bassist and {{prolific}} songwriter {{and composer}} Willie Dixon {{played a major}} role on the Chicago blues scene.

Most artists of the Chicago blues style recorded for the Chicago-based Chess Records and Checker Records labels. Smaller blues labels of this era included Vee-Jay Records and J.O.B. Records. During the early 1950s, the dominating Chicago labels were challenged by Sam Phillips' Sun Records company in Memphis, which recorded B. B. King and Howlin' Wolf before he moved to Chicago in 1960. After Phillips discovered Elvis Presley in 1954, the Sun label turned to the rapidly expanding white audience and started recording mostly rock 'n' roll.|$|E

2500|$|After the race, Michael Schumacher accused Coulthard of [...] "unsporting behaviour" [...] in {{the battle}} for the race lead. The {{accusation}} arose from Coulthard's minor collision with the Ferrari driver. Michael Schumacher believed that Coulthard was driving dangerously: [...] "He [...] ran in a way that he thought it [...] could happen, and he didn't try to avoid that, that's pretty simple. As he is not fighting for the championship.....I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that we don't see teammates helping the drivers fighting for the championship in the way which is not appropriate." [...] Coulthard denied any wrongdoing: [...] "I could have easily pushed him off the circuit. But I didn't and I won't in the future because it is not sporting and it is not the way I do things."
