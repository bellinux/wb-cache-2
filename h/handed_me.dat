25|$|ASL makes {{heavy use}} of time-sequenced {{ordering}}, meaning that events are signed {{in the order}} in which they occur. For example, for I was late to class last night because my boss <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> a huge stack of work after lunch yesterday, one would sign 'yesterday lunch finish, boss give-me work big-stack, night class late-me'. In stories, however, ordering is malleable, since one can choose to sequence the events either in {{the order in which}} they occurred or in the order in which one found out about them.|$|E
25|$|I {{jumped into}} a seal hole, pushing the ice away as I entered, and they <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> my camera. Surprisingly, I wasn't too cold, except around where my mouth {{held on to}} my regulator, and that {{instantly}} froze and became numb. Suddenly everything was quiet and I found myself looking at easily {{one of the most}} extraordinary scenes I had ever, ever experienced. When I dropped down {{through a hole in the}} ice, I was completely surrounded by ice: a tunnel maybe twenty feet across. Everything above me on the land was roaring with wind and down there, there was absolutely no sound except for the distant trills of Weddell seals.|$|E

And I talked about it to the papers, gay magazines, and it didn't wind up on the album with the cut-off date. I felt really badly about that. So he just <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> a CD and said, ‘Here are 10 tracks for the kids; tell me which one you like the best.’ I fell in love with 'Rock With U'." ...|$|E

500|$|Some commenters on Wright's Facebook page {{were skeptical}} of his claims, {{pointing}} {{to differences in}} the costume between the two videos; Wright explained the differences by saying he wanted, and made, a better cloak for the second video. Krahbichler accepted Wright's claims. [...] "It {{would be too much}} of a hassle just to play along for this long, and making up stories that fit so well," [...] he wrote shortly after the second video was posted. [...] "I believe it is very safe to say that PWW is indeed the creator". In an early December exchange on Facebook, Wright had told him he had chosen him as the recipient since he had [...] "won the business card lottery ... you <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> your business card, at some point". Krahbichler speculated that Wright had probably attended {{at least one of the}} many tech shows where he had had a booth.|$|E

It was revealed in 2008 that Khan's second book, Indus Journey: A Personal View of Pakistan, had required heavy editing from the publisher. [...] The publisher Jeremy Lewis revealed in a memoir {{that when he}} asked Khan to show his writing for publication, [...] "he <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> a leatherbound notebook or diary containing a few jottings and autobiographical snippets.

Asked if {{she might}} one day be lured back to mainstream stage, film or television, Harris said in the 2002 interview: Well, if someone <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> something fantastic for 10 million dollars, I'd work again. But I haven't worked {{in a long time}} as an actor. I don't miss it. I think the only thing that drew me to acting in the first place was the group of people I was working with: Ed Asner, Paul Sills, Mike Nichols, Elaine May. And all I really wanted to do back then was rehearsal. I was in it for the process, and I really resented having {{to go out and do}} a performance for an audience, because the process stopped; it had to freeze and be the same every night. It wasn't as interesting." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Driver was {{financed by}} EMI Films who {{announced}} {{they would make}} a second film with Hill, a Western he wrote with Roger Spottiswoode, The Last Gun. However The Driver was a commercial failure in the US. [...] "To say it did not do well would be kind," [...] said Hill. [...] "Had I not been shooting The Warriors at the time, I don't think my career would have survived. They loved it overseas, but in those days, that didn't matter that much. It made exactly zero dollars in the United States. I remember the studio had this huge sheaf of Xeroxed reviews they'd <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> — you could stop a fucking [...]45 slug with this stack, it was so thick. And of all the reviews in this six-inch thick pile, {{there was only one}} good one."

2500|$|According to road manager Don Opperman: [...] "The way I {{remember}} it, the 'ooos' and the 'boos' {{were mixed}} together, but Stevie was pretty disappointed. Stevie [...] just <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> his guitar {{and walked off}} stage, and I'm like, 'Are you coming back?' There was a doorway back there; the audience couldn't see the guys, but I could. He {{went back to the}} dressing room with his head in his hands. I went back there finally, {{and that was the end}} of the show." [...] According to Vaughan: [...] "It wasn't the whole crowd [...] It was just a few people sitting right up front. The room there was built for acoustic jazz. When five or six people boo, wow. It sounds like the whole world hates you. They thought we were too loud, but shoot, I had four army blankets folded over my amp, and the volume level was on 2. I'm used to playin' on 10!" [...] The performance was filmed and later released on DVD in September 2004.|$|E
2500|$|Working {{with some}} of Spain's best-known actresses {{including}} Carmen Maura, Victoria Abril, Marisa Paredes and Penélope Cruz, Almodóvar has become famous for his female-centric films, his [...] "sympathetic portrayals of women" [...] and his elevation of [...] "the humdrum spaces of overworked women". He was heavily influenced by classic Hollywood films in which everything happens around a female main character, and aims to continue in that tradition. Almodóvar has frequently spoken {{about how he was}} surrounded by powerful women in his childhood: [...] "Women were very happy, worked hard and always spoke. They <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> the first sensations and forged my character. The woman represented everything to me, the man was absent and represented authority. I never identified with the male figure: maternity inspires me more than paternity". His portrayal of women in his films have been admired by most critics, but some representations have led to accusations of misogyny. A critic from Popmatters wrote that what [...] "many of the women in Almodóvar's films do have in common, despite their characterization as victim or martyr or heroine, is that they are survivors", noting that Almodóvar is interested in depicting women overcoming tragedies and adversities and the power of close female relationships. Ryan Vlastelica [...] from AVClub wrote: [...] "Many of his characters track a Byzantine plot to a cathartic reunion, a meeting where all can be understood, if not forgiven. They seek redemption". Almodóvar stated that he does not usually write roles for specific actors, but after casting a film, he custom-tailors the characters to suit the actors; he believes his role as a director is a [...] "mirror for the actors - a mirror that can't lie".|$|E
