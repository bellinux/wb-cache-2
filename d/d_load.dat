40|$|Small-cell {{architecture}} is widely adopted by cellular network operators to increase network capacity. By reducing {{the size of}} cells, operators can pack more (low-power) base stations in an area to better serve the growing demands, without causing extra interference. However, this approach suffers from low spectrum temporal efficiency. When a cell becomes smaller and covers fewer users, its total traffic fluctuates significantly due to insufficient traffic aggregation and exhibiting a large "peak-to-mean" ratio. As operators customarily provision spectrum for peak traffic, large traffic temporal fluctuation inevitably leads to low spectrum temporal efficiency. In this paper, we advocate device-to-device (D 2 D) load-balancing as a useful mechanism to address the fundamental drawback of small-cell architecture. The idea is to shift traffic from a congested cell to its adjacent under-utilized cells by leveraging inter-cell D 2 D communication, so that the traffic can be served without using extra spectrum, effectively improving the spectrum temporal efficiency. We provide theoretical modeling and analysis to characterize the benefit of D 2 <b>D</b> <b>load</b> balancing, in terms of total spectrum requirements of all individual cells. We also derive the corresponding cost, in terms of incurred D 2 D traffic overhead. We carry out empirical evaluations based on real-world 4 G data traces to gauge the benefit and cost of D 2 <b>D</b> <b>load</b> balancing under practical settings. The results show that D 2 <b>D</b> <b>load</b> balancing can reduce the spectrum requirement by 25 % {{as compared to the}} standard scenario without D 2 <b>D</b> <b>load</b> balancing, at the expense of negligible 0. 7 % D 2 D traffic overhead...|$|E

The highly conserved interaction between CD 1 d:α-Galactosylceramide (αGC) complexes and the iNKT TCR not only defines this population of αβ T cells {{but can also}} be used for its direct identification. Therefore, CD 1 d oligomers are a widely used tool for iNKT cell related investigations. To this end, the lipid chains of the antigen have to be inserted into the hydrophobic pockets of the CD 1 d binding cleft, often with help of surfactants. In this study, we investigated the influence of different surfactants (Triton X- 100, Tween 20, Tyloxapol) on in vitro loading of CD 1 d molecules derived from four different species (human, mouse, rat and cotton rat) with αGC and derivatives carrying modifications of the acyl-chain (DB 01 - 1, PBS 44) and a 6 -acetamido- 6 -deoxy-addition at the galactosyl head group (PBS 57).

In addition, the test strengths were compared with the design strengths calculated using the Indian Standard and North American Specification for Cold –Formed steel structures. Compression members are linear members in which axial forces act to cause elongation (stretch).

A soil-foundation failure limit, {{is defined as a}} domain of resistance in the two dimensional (2 <b>D)</b> <b>load</b> space (N, M) inside of which lie all the admissible combinations of loads; these latter correspond to a pure elastic, non-linear elastic or plastic behavior of the soil-foundation system, while the points lying on the failure limit correspond to a combination of loads leading to a failure of the soil-foundation system. In this study, the proposed resistance domain is constructed analytically based on mechanics. Original elastic limit, uplift initiation limit and iso-uplift limits are constructed inside this domain. These limits give a prediction of the mechanisms activated for each combination of loads applied to the foundation. A comparison of the proposed failure limit with experimental tests existing in the literature shows interesting results. Also, the developed uplift initiation limit and iso-uplift curves are confronted with others already proposed in the literature and widely used due to the absence of other alternatives, and remarkable differences are noted, showing evident errors in the past proposals and relevant accuracy for those given in the present work...|$|E

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients who needed bilateral canine retraction to close extraction space {{were selected for}} this split-mouth clinical trial. After initial alignment and leveling, two canines in each patient {{were randomly assigned to}} receive either translation (TR) or controlled tipping (CT) load. The load was delivered by segmental T-loops designed to give specific initial moment/force ratios to the canines in each treatment interval (TI), verified with an orthodontic force tester. Maxillary dental casts were made before canine retraction and after each TI. The casts were digitized with a 3 D laser scanner. The digital models were superimposed on the palatal rugae region. The 3 D canine displacements and the displacement patterns in terms of TR, CT, and torque were calculated for each TI. RESULTS: The method can reliably detect a TR displacement greater than 0. 3 mm and a rotation greater than 1. 5 °. Ninety-two TIs had displacements that were greater than 0. 3 mm and were used for further analysis. Most displacements were oriented within ± 45 ° from the distal direction. The displacement pattern in terms of TR or CT was not uniquely controlled by the initial moment/force ratio.

S 4 WT is a general-purpose commercial code for wind turbine design and analysis. At present, it uses blade element momentum theory (BEM) for the estimation of the aerodynamics loads on HAWT rotor blades. BEM is a simple aerodynamic modeling approach that is currently used by several software packages for wind turbine design (as well as other rotor-based applications). It {{is based on the assumption}} that the flow can be treated as quasi-steady and quasi- 2 D, so that the steady, 2 D aerodynamic loads acting on a strip of a rotor blade are used to estimate the instantaneous unsteady, 3 D loads acting on a complete blade. This approach ignores the effect of the unsteady wake of the blades on the aerodynamic loads and simplifies the true 3 <b>D</b> <b>load</b> distribution over the blades. A higher fidelity calculation of the time varying aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the blades is the main focus of this work. A good compromise between speed and accuracy to calculate these forces is the 3 D unsteady vortex lattice method with a freely deforming wake. The vortex lattice results are compared to the BEM results from S 4 WT. The ultimate aim is to integrate the vortex lattice calculation as a subroutine in S 4 WT in order to calculate the unsteady aerodynamic forces on the rotor blades during the design process. This new method in S 4 WT will provide more representative results to the user, which can be very important for designing a more efficient wind turbine...|$|E

The delivered force, which is a critical parameter in massage during IASTM, has not been measured or standardized for most clinical practices. In addition to the force, the angle of treatment and frequency play an important role during IASTM. As a result, there is a strong need to characterize the delivered force to a patient, angle of treatment, and stroke frequency. This thesis proposes two novel mechatronic designs for a specific instrument from Graston Technique(Model GT 3), which is a frequently used tool to clinically deliver localize pressure to the soft tissue. The first design is based on compression load cells, where 4 -load cells are used to measure the force components in three-dimensional space. The second design uses a 3 <b>D</b> <b>load</b> cell, which can measure all three force components force simultaneously. Both designs are implemented with IMUduino microcontroller chips which can also measure tool orientation angles and provide computed stroke frequency. Both designs, which were created using Creo CAD platform, were also analyzed thorough strength and integrity using the finite element analysis package ANSYS. Once the static analysis was completed, a dynamic model was created for the first design to simulate IASTM practice using the GT- 3 tool. The deformation and stress on skin were measured after applying force with the GT- 3 tool. Additionally, the relationship between skin stress and the load cell measurements has been investigated. The second design of the mechatronic IASTM tool was validated for force measurements using an electronic plate scale that provided the baseline force values to compare with the applied force values measured by the tool. The load cell measurements and the scale readings were found to be in agreement within the expected degree of accuracy.

FE models capable of reproducing this behaviour would provide valuable insight into the healing potential of different fixation systems. Current model validation techniques lack depth in 6 <b>D</b> <b>load</b> and deformation measurements. Other aspects of the FE model creation such as the definition of interfaces between components have also not been explored.

Stiffness calculated from the interfragmentary movement was found to be an unsuitable summary parameter as the error propagation is too large.

The out of plane behaviours prevalent in the experimental work were not replicated in the model. The interfaces between the components were investigated experimentally and through modification to the FE model. Incorporation of the interface modelling techniques into the full construct models had no effect in compression but did act to reduce torsional stiffness bringing it closer to that of the experiment. The interface definitions had no effect on out of plane behaviours, which were still not replicated.

The cyclic irregular loading history {{in this thesis}} was represented by the equivalent number of cycles Neq with {{a certain level of}} cyclic to average stress ratio tcy / ta which can be derived using cyclic shear strain accumulation procedure developed in NGI. The first part is the bearing capacity analysis of bucket foundation in clay. The second part is to produce the displacement contour diagrams. The bearing capacity analysis used in-house software BIFURC from NGI. The normalized failure envelopes were investigated for different degree of cyclic degradation expressed by Neq, soil profiles and bucket foundation geometry h / D. The two soil profiles used in this thesis project were constant cyclic shear strength with depth for OCR= 40 and linearly increase cyclic shear strength with depth for OCR= 1 & 40. Drammen clay was used as basis for the evaluation. The mobilized ultimate capacity were plotted for pure horizontal load, pure vertical load and pure overturning moment. The loads were applied in the decoupling point, meaning that the pure horizontal load fail under pure sliding. It was found that the three load component were equally influenced by cyclic degradation and that the increase and reduction in the total failure as function of Neq and Fcy / Fa could be defined by one curve for a given OCR. The cyclic effect during combined loading was studied through normalized failure envelopes. The normalized failure envelopes do not change for changing cyclic loading history for the same soil profile. The normalized failure envelopes changed in HM load plane due to different h/D and different soil profiles. The failure envelopes describes a full surface in the 3 <b>D</b> <b>load</b> space HVM. Besides, the failure envelopes could be described by formulas suggested by Gourvenec and Barnett with some modifications for the failure envelopes in HM plane.

The key questions are how the tooth’s environment changes {{in response to}} the orthodontic load and how the biological tissues respond clinically. The objectives of this study are to determine the mechanical environment (ME) changes and to quantify the biological tissues’ response. Eighteen (18) patients who needed maxillary bilateral canine retractions were involved in the study. A method was developed to quantify the 3 <b>D</b> <b>load</b> systems on the canine, which allowed the treatment strategies to be customized in terms of orthodontic loading systems to meet either translation (TR) or controlled tipping (CT) requirement. Dental casts were made before and after each treatment interval, and the Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) scans were taken prior to and following the entire treatment for control of treatment strategy and post treatment evaluations. Finite element method (FEM) was applied to calculate the location of center of resistance (CRes) for tooth movement control. The location and variation of CRes were recorded and compared with previous studies. A quick CRes assessment method that locates CRes by calculating the centroid of the contact surface (CCS) and the centroid of the projection of root surface (CPCS) in certain direction was also tested and compared with the results from FEM. Customized T-loop spring, a kind of orthodontic appliance, was designed, fabricated, and calibrated on a load measuring system to ensure that the load met the clinician’s prescription. The treatment outcomes in terms of tooth displacement and root resorption characterized by the changes of tooth length and volume as well as the bone mineral density (BMD) represented by the Hounsfield units (HU) change were recorded and analyzed. The ME in terms of stress were also calculated by using FEM. Paired t-test and mixed model ANOVA methods were used to analyze the relationships between the mechanical inputs (quantified and customized load, and corresponding stress) and clinical outcomes (root resorption and BMD change). It was found that the overall root resorption is not significant for canine retraction, but apical root resorption does occur, meaning that orthodontic load is not a sufficient factor. Also, it was observed that HU distribution changed significantly in both root and alveolar bone. The maximum reduction was on the coronal level in the direction perpendicular to the direction of movement in root, and {{in the direction of the}} tooth movement at the coronal level in bone. In addition, it was determined that the locations of the CRes in the MD and BL directions were significantly different. The locations of the CRes of a human canine in MD and BL directions can be estimated by finding the CPCSs in the two directions. Finally, it was shown that the stress invariants can be used to characterize how the osteocytes feel when ME changes. The stress invariants in the alveolar bone are not significantly affected by different M/F. The higher bone modeling/remodeling activities along the direction of tooth movement may be related to the initial volumetric increase and decrease in the alveolar bone...|$|E

The location and variation of CRes were recorded and compared with previous studies. A quick CRes assessment method that locates CRes by calculating the centroid of the contact surface (CCS) and the centroid of the projection of root surface (CPCS) in certain direction was also tested and compared with the results from FEM. Customized T-loop spring, a kind of orthodontic appliance, was designed, fabricated, and calibrated on a load measuring system to ensure that the load met the clinician 2 ̆ 7 s prescription. The treatment outcomes in terms of tooth displacement and root resorption characterized by the changes of tooth length and volume as well as the bone mineral density (BMD) represented by the Hounsfield units (HU) change were recorded and analyzed. The ME in terms of stress were also calculated by using FEM. Paired t-test and mixed model ANOVA methods were used to analyze the relationships between the mechanical inputs (quantified and customized load, and corresponding stress) and clinical outcomes (root resorption and BMD change). It was found that the overall root resorption is not significant for canine retraction, but apical root resorption does occur, meaning that orthodontic load is not a sufficient factor. Also, it was observed that HU distribution changed significantly in both root and alveolar bone. The maximum reduction was on the coronal level in the direction perpendicular to the direction of movement in root, and {{in the direction of the}} tooth movement at the coronal level in bone. In addition, it was determined that the locations of the CRes in the MD and BL directions were significantly different. The locations of the CRes of a human canine in MD and BL directions can be estimated by finding the CPCSs in the two directions. Finally, it was shown that the stress invariants can be used to characterize how the osteocytes feel when ME changes. The stress invariants in the alveolar bone are not significantly affected by different M/F. The higher bone modeling/remodeling activities along the direction of tooth movement may be related to the initial volumetric increase and decrease in the alveolar bone...|$|E
40|$|The analysis, {{modeling}} {{and design of}} the lift-driven Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) has challenged the wind energy community for many decades; this limited progress in knowledge has severely impaired {{the development of the}} VAWT, giving rise to the myth that the VAWT rotor is inherently inefficient (in comparison with the more conventional Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine - HAWT) or too complex for commercial implementation. In this research work, we take a new path on the analysis of the VAWT: instead of considering a rotor that creates a perturbation on the flow (wake and induction field), we consider an unsteady wake, to which a rotor energy-conversion system is associated, obtaining the loading on the blade by better understanding the flow. The research aims at understanding the wake and its relation with energy conversion and the loading on the rotor system. Four main questions drive this research:  What is the relation between blade loading and energy conversion?  How does the near wake of the VAWT develop?  What is the difference between the 2 D and the 3 D wake?  How does understanding the near wake improve our design? At the end of this dissertation we achieve a clear and insightful view on the 2 D and 3 D aerodynamics {{from the point of view}} of the wake, that significantly improves the aerodynamic design and optimization of new VAWT rotors for energy conversion and propulsion, opening a new design space and methodology. The results and discussion presented in this dissertation are organized in five steps (see thesis outline, Chapter 1) :  Part I: understand the fundamental VAWT aerodynamics and how these relate with the research presented in this dissertation.  Part II: understand the energy exchange process in the 2 D plane by understanding the shedding of the wake over the rotation, and the wake expansion in 2 D. Analyze the impact of dynamic stall on the near wake evolution, and how to extract blade load information from the near wake in dynamic stall.  Part III: understand the impact of the spanwise dimension of the rotor and the role of the consequent trailing vorticity. Investigate the little known skewed flow.  Part IV: understand better the energy exchange process, the wake’s generation and the decoupling between loading and energy conversion. Propose new approaches and guidelines for the aerodynamic rotor design.  Part V: discuss the main results and conclusions of the research, and its impact on new aerodynamic research and design approaches, both for 2 D and 3 D VAWT rotors. In Part I (Chapter 2) we frame our research approach, analyzing the VAWT from a wake perspective, by considering both 2 D and 3 D aerodynamics of the VAWT at two different scales: aerofoil/blade scale and rotor scale. We divide the rotor in windward (315 ? < ? < 45 ?), upwind (45 ?< ? < 135 ?), leeward (135 ? < ? < 225 ?) and downwind (225 ? < ? < 315 ?) regions of the rotation. This approach obsolesces the conventional division of the rotor into upwind and downwind halves; while the upwind/downwind division is driven by angle of attack considerations (blade loading problem), this new segmentation is determined by the shedding of vorticity (energy conversion problem), a more useful and effective approach. The wake is also split into shed vorticity due to the time gradient of the bound circulation, and trailing vorticity due to the spatial gradient of the bound circulation; this division leads to our 2 D and 3 D analysis of the flow. In Part II, we analyze the 2 D rotor and wake at two scales: rotor and blade. The two flow scales are obviously related, in the sense that the rotor’s aerodynamics are the result of the wakes generated at the several blades and the blade experiences an induction field due to the vorticity distributed over the wake at the rotor scale. The separation in blade and rotor scale is in fact a separation of two views on the total system:  The rotor, as an energy exchange system, where the energy exchange results in a wake and streamline expansion.  The blade, as an aerodynamic loading system, where the design-objective loading is associated with an equivalent bound circulation. The time variation of this bound circulation results in a shed wake. The 2 D potential-flow analysis (Chapter 3) shows that:  the conventional breakdown of the VAWT into upwind and downwind actuator systems is incorrect, leading to an overestimation of energy conversion on the upwind half of the rotation and an underestimation in the downwind half.  contrary to the HAWT, the induction is not a function of the total loading, but only of the load component associated with the azimuthally varying circulation.  it is possible to significantly improve Double Multiple Streamtube models by incorporating a better description of the flow. The proposed improved model clearly surpasses conventional models on the prediction of the induction and loading.  the impact of the blade bound-circulation constant-term is small in comparison to the time-varying bound-circulation term; therefore, the induction field of the 2 D VAWT in potential flow can be defined by only the number of blades, rotor solidity and tip-speed ratio. This allows for the obsolescence of streamtube momentum models, replaced by faster and more accurate potential flow vortex models. In Chapters 4 and 5 we visualize and quantify, experimentally and numerically, the flow field in the near wake of the blade during the upwind and leeward segments of the motion, at tip-speed ratios ? = 2, 3 and 4, using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). An interesting physical aspect of the vortical flow in dynamic stall, especially at low tip-speed ratios, is the transport of the shed vorticity with the blade. This transport of the vortical structures with the blade means that the geometry of the wake, due to viscous effects, differs from what is obtained with potential flow. A different spatial distribution of the shed vorticity implies a different induction field, which might imply a reduction of the effectiveness of momentum models and simple potential-flow models and change the rotor’s performance. The results show two important effects:  At the rotor scale, the transport of vorticity with the blade, rolled in the leading edge/trailing edge separated vortices.  At the blade scale, the importance of the small scale vortices for the oscillations on pressure distribution and loads. In Chapter 6 we use the experimental and numerical data from the previous chapters to evaluate the feasibility of extracting information from the flow/wake measured with PIV, even in dynamic stall, for improving flow analysis and model validation. In Part III we introduce the fourth dimension of our problem: the spanwise direction. The finite span leads to a non-constant spanwise distribution of circulation on the blade, and this distribution leads to the release of trailing vorticity, of which the blade tip vortex is the most prominent component. In Chapter 7 we measure the wake at the tip-vortex region of the VAWT; in Chapter 8 we combine these experimental results with 3 D unsteady free-wake potential-flow simulations to:  experimentally and numerically observe, quantify and analyze the generation and convection of the 3 D tip vortex of the VAWT.  experimentally, numerically and analytically investigate the effect of blade-tip shape on the generation and convection of the tip vortex, with focus on the added circulation due to the motion of the blade.  combine experimental measurements and numerical simulations to analyze: the 3 D wake of the VAWT; the interaction between shed and trailing vorticity; the roll-up and expansion of the wake in the leeward and windward regions; the in-rotor convection and inboard/outboard motion of the tip vortex; the 3 D induction field; the 3 D blade wake interaction during the downwind blade passage; and the effect of trailing vorticity in the spanwise distribution of circulation, including the 2 D to 3 <b>D</b> <b>load</b> direction reversal in the downwind blade passage. The spanwise dimension of the flow also gives rise to a new form of misalignment between the flow and the axis: skewed flow. In Chapter 9 we analyze the physics of skewed flow, flow asymmetry, near wake development, blade-wake interaction and impact on energy conversion. The analysis of the VAWT from the point of view of the 2 D and 3 D near wake is shown to be very effective in understanding: the physics of the flow; the energy exchange process; how the total energy exchange over one rotation actually relates to the local aerodynamic loading on the blade; the impact of implementing an essentially 2 D energy conversion process into a 3 D aerodynamic system; and the resulting inefficiencies due to the finite span and trailing vorticity. In Part IV (Chapter 10) we show that it is possible to decompose the VAWT design problem into designing for loading and designing for energy conversion, opening a large design space and proposing a new methodology, impacting both 2 D and 3 D flow. We also show that, although the 2 D wake does not vary significantly with variation in the pitching axis location and blade camber, the 3 D wake and performance are significantly affected by these variations. This is due to the impact that varying the bound circulation has on the release of trailing vorticity; a larger trailing vorticity generated during the upwind blade passage implies a larger induction due to trailing vorticity, and a worse interaction at the downwind blade passage. The effects of variation of camber and/or pitching axis in 2 D and 3 D performance are contradictory and complementary and can be simultaneously optimized. In Part V (Chapter 11) we further develop these and other main conclusions, discussing their impact on VAWT aerodynamics. The research here presented implies a break from conventional approaches to the VAWT aerodynamics, allowing for the development of new research and models, both in 2 D flow (aerofoil design, rotor energy conversion optimization) and 3 D flow (blade and rotor shape, non-uniform flows) ...|$|E

So in case of thick laminates, the increase in values of [K~] due to increase in temperature difference shall not result in enhancement of the normalized buckling load to the extent demonstrated by the authors.
