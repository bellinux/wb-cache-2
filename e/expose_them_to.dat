5|$|MTV Unplugged (listed on iTunes as MTV Unplugged: Katy Perry) is an {{extended}} play (EP) and live album by American singer Katy Perry, {{released in the}} United States on November 13, 2009 by Capitol Records. After airing more than 100 MTV Unplugged specials, MTV wanted {{to bring back the}} series, in order to <b>expose</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> a younger generation. The channel recruited various mainstream and popular artists to perform as part of the series, including Perry, who particularly expressed interest in the idea as it would allow her to showcase herself as an artist and share the stories behind her songs.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} {{afternoon}} of 3 April, Moore considered conducting a further raid on Kaafjord the next day. He decided against doing so as the preliminary assessment of photos taken during the attack had concluded that Tirpitz was badly damaged. Moore was also aware that his aircrew were fatigued, and was reluctant to <b>expose</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> what would now be alert defences. Accordingly, he ordered that the fleet return to base, and it arrived at Scapa Flow in the afternoon of 6 April. King George VI and Prime Minister Winston Churchill sent congratulatory messages to the fleet, but both Churchill and Cunningham were concerned that Tirpitz could be returned to service. Cunningham also regretted Moore's decision not to launch a further strike on 4 April.|$|E
5|$|Camas pocket gophers cause {{significant}} economic losses, so may {{be treated as}} an agricultural pest. Crops damaged include clover, alfalfa and vetch. The gophers may eat these crops or damage the roots while burrowing. This can injure the roots and <b>expose</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> air, causing them to dry out. Subterranean activity can also damage the roots of fruit trees. Root crops are particularly susceptible to damage and consumption; potatoes, carrots, parsnips and other crops may be eaten on site or dragged off by the gopher for caching in the burrow. Excavated soil can cover grass and limit lifestock grazing; freshly sprouted grains may be similarly damaged. An estimate of impact from camas pocket gopher activities in the Willamette Valley in 1918 amounted to $1.5million annual losses. Gopher activities can provide a benefit of soil aeration, enhancing water retention after rain or snowmelt. Buried vegetation can also compost, enhancing organic soil content to provide additional benefits.|$|E

5|$|The battle {{began at}} about 9am on 14 October and lasted all day, but while a broad outline is known, the exact events are {{obscured}} by contradictory accounts in the sources. Although {{the numbers on}} each side were about equal, William had both cavalry and infantry, including many archers, while Harold had only foot soldiers and few, if any, archers. The English soldiers formed up as a shield wall along the ridge and were at first so effective that William's army was thrown back with heavy casualties. Some of William's Breton troops panicked and fled, {{and some of the}} English troops appear to have pursued the fleeing Bretons until they themselves were attacked and destroyed by Norman cavalry. During the Bretons' flight, rumours swept through the Norman forces that the duke had been killed, but William succeeded in rallying his troops. Two further Norman retreats were feigned, to once again draw the English into pursuit and <b>expose</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> repeated attacks by the Norman cavalry. The available sources are more confused about events in the afternoon, but it appears that the decisive event was Harold's death, about which differing stories are told. William of Jumièges claimed that Harold was killed by the duke. The Bayeux Tapestry has been claimed to show Harold's death by an arrow to the eye, but that may be a later reworking of the tapestry to conform to 12th-century stories in which Harold was slain by an arrow wound to the head.|$|E

25|$|Going {{into the}} sixth test at the Oval, all England {{could hope for}} was to salvage some pride {{in the form of}} at least a solitary test win.

Traffickers may hold their victims captive, <b>expose</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> large amounts of alcohol or use drugs, keep them in isolation, or withhold food or sleep. During this time the victim often begins to feel the onset of depression, guilt and self-blame, anger and rage, and sleep disturbances, PTSD, numbing, and extreme stress. Under these pressures, the victim can fall into the hopeless mental state of learned helplessness.|$|E

25|$|Funding {{from federal}} and private sources for {{research}} at MSU was $109.5 {{million in the}} 2009-2010 school year (Cruzado's first year on campus, reflecting grants awarded during her predecessor's tenure). It fell to $102.7 million in the 2010-2011 school year. This included a five-year, $3.85 million grant from the National Science Foundation to study fire and climate change in forests in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Statets. The grant was shared with the University of Colorado, the University of Idaho, and the United States Forest Service, and it was unclear how much money actually went to MSU. It also included a $1.6 million grant from the United States Department of Energy to study ways to store carbon dioxide underground, a grant the university had been working to obtain from Congress for several years. Another award was a four-year, $1.2 million grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The grant paid for integration of biomedical science into the undergraduate curriculum and paid for undergraduate biomedical research. It also paid for science and technology outreach to {{elementary and middle school}} Native Americans, and for scholarships to bring Native American students to MSU and <b>expose</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> science and technology courses.
