500|$|In 1888, Narendra {{left the}} monastery as a Parivrâjaka— the Hindu {{religious}} {{life of a}} wandering monk, [...] "without <b>fixed</b> <b>abode,</b> without ties, independent and strangers wherever they go". His sole possessions were a kamandalu (water pot), staff and his two favourite books: the Bhagavad Geeta and The Imitation of Christ. Narendra travelled extensively in India for five years, visiting centres of learning and acquainting himself with diverse religious traditions and social patterns. He developed sympathy for the suffering and poverty of the people, and resolved to uplift the nation. Living primarily on bhiksha (alms), Narendra travelled on foot and by railway (with tickets bought by admirers). During his travels he met, and stayed with Indians from all religions and walks of life: scholars, dewans, rajas, Hindus, Muslims, Christians, paraiyars (low-caste workers) and government officials. Narendra left Bombay for Chicago on 31 May 1893 with the name [...] "Vivekananda", as suggested by Ajit Singh of Khetri, which means [...] "the bliss of discerning wisdom".|$|E

[...] Rilke depicted the six artists about to begin their performance, and that they were used as a symbol of [...] "human activity... always travelling and with no <b>fixed</b> <b>abode,</b> they are even a shade more fleeting than the rest of us, whose fleetingness was lamented." [...] Further, Rilke in the poem described these figures as standing on a [...] "threadbare carpet" [...] to suggest [...] "the ultimate loneliness and isolation of Man in this incomprehensible world, practicing their profession from childhood to death as playthings of an unknown will... before their 'pure too-little' had passed into 'empty too-much.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Red foxes either {{establish}} stable home ranges within particular {{areas or}} are itinerant with no <b>fixed</b> <b>abode.</b> [...] They use their urine to mark their territories. A male fox raises one hind leg and his urine is sprayed forward {{in front of}} him, whereas a female fox squats down so that the urine is sprayed in the ground between the hind legs. Urine {{is also used to}} mark empty cache sites, used to store found food, as reminders not to waste time investigating them. [...] The use of up to 12 different urination postures allows them to precisely control the position of the scent mark. Red foxes live in family groups sharing a joint territory. In favourable habitats and/or areas with low hunting pressure, subordinate foxes may be present in a range. Subordinate foxes may number one or two, sometimes up to eight in one territory. These subordinates could be formerly dominant animals, but are mostly young from the previous year, who act as helpers in rearing the breeding vixen's kits. Alternatively, their presence has been explained as being in response to temporary surpluses of food unrelated to assisting reproductive success. Non-breeding vixens will guard, play, groom, provision and retrieve kits, an example of kin selection. Red foxes may leave their families once they reach adulthood if the chances of winning a territory of their own are high. If not, they will stay with their parents, at the cost of postponing their own reproduction.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{the insistence}} of Wolfe Tone another French {{expedition}} was sent to Ireland in 1798. On this expedition an independent mission was assigned to James Napper Tandy. He {{was put in charge}} of the Anacreon, one of the fastest sailing corvettes in the French navy, to rush stores to Jean Joseph Amable Humbert’s forces and those Irish expected to flock to his standard. [...] Tandy chose his staff from among those who sided with him in the split with Tone’s party. Preparations for the voyage frequently brought Tandy to Paris, and as he had no <b>fixed</b> <b>abode</b> in the city he frequented the house of Colonel James Blackwell. A warm friendship sprang up between Blackwell’s wife and Tandy. She is referred to in his correspondence as “my much esteemed and amiable Friend, Mrs. Blackwell.” [...] On one such visit in August Colonel Blackwell, Tandy’s adjutant-general, introduced a young Irishman, named Murphy to him. The man proved to be a spy. [...] Also on board the Anacreon was George Orr. Formerly a reporter of parliamentary debates for the Morning Post and a tailor by trade, he too was a spy, code name Smith. Dunkirk was a town known to be infested with spies, and the British Government were well informed on the expedition’s developments. At 4pm on Tuesday, 4 September 1798, the Anacreon left Dunkirk for Ireland.|$|E

2500|$|The {{beginnings}} of the Bishopric of Moray are unclear. [...] The first mention of a bishop was Gregoir whose name appeared on several royal charters in the 1120s. [...] The early Bishops of Moray had no <b>fixed</b> <b>abode</b> but moved between houses at Birnie, Kinneddar and Spynie. In 1172, King William I, the Lion, made grants to {{the church of the}} Holy Trinity of the Bishopric of Moray and to Bishop Simon de Tosny. Formal permission for the permanent move to Spynie was given by Pope Innocent III to Bishop Bricius de Douglas in April 1206 and the transfer was probably made by 1208. Bishop Bricius attended the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 and may have appealed to Innocent to transfer the See of Moray to Elgin. [...] However, he certainly wrote to him requesting the move before July 1216. The cathedral church at Spynie was considered vulnerable to attack and too far from the market. Elgin with its Royal castle would have been seen as a better option. Bricius did not live to see the changes made, dying in 1222, but his successor, Bishop Andrew of Moray carried them out. Although the See of Moray was transferred to the Church of the Holy Trinity in Elgin on 19 July 1224, the Bishop of Moray's episcopal palace remained at Spynie.|$|E
2500|$|In the Instructions {{that were}} drawn up since 1462 the {{jurisdiction}} of the court as a tribunal of first instance was defined according to people who fell under its jurisdiction (ratione personae) and subject matters (ratione materiae) under its jurisdiction. In the category of people fell privileged persons like noblemen, Church officials and government officials, and [...] "defenseless" [...] people like women, clergymen, and widows and orphans, who deserved the special protection of the Count. Furthermore, foreigners without a <b>fixed</b> <b>abode</b> in Holland fell into this category. As to subject matter for the original jurisdiction of the court: all matters of concern to the Count, like his feudal Fees and domains, his rights (like Mint and High justice), and offices in his gift (read for [...] "Count" [...] after 1572 the States of Holland and Zeeland, who had already de facto taken over his sovereignty). Furthermore, important land-use cases, and conflicts between local governments fell under its jurisdiction, as did legal actions in connection with Possession (as opposed to Property actions). The last category was transferred to the original jurisdiction of the Hoge Raad after 1582, as was the original jurisdiction over cases of maritime law, and the grant of middelen van herstel en gunst (certain legal actions like e.g. the Cession of property by a debtor to his creditor). Unfortunately, when the Hoge Raad received its Instruction from the States-General in 1582 the Instruction of the Hof was not changed {{at the same time to}} reflect the transfer of competences in these respects. The Hof therefore continued hearing cases that formally belonged to the Hoge Raad which caused some competition between the two courts. Only in 1660 did the States of Holland resolve that in possession cases each court had to inform the other of such cases to make some coordination possible.|$|E

60|$|In some countries, {{the large}} cities absorb {{the wealth and}} fashion of the nation; {{they are the only}} <b>fixed</b> <b>abodes</b> of elegant and {{intelligent}} society, and the country is inhabited almost entirely by boorish peasantry. In England, on the contrary, the metropolis is a mere gathering-place, or general rendezvous, of the polite classes, where they devote {{a small portion of the}} year to a hurry of gayety and dissipation, and, having indulged this kind of carnival, return again to the apparently more congenial habits of rural life. The various orders of society are therefore diffused over the whole surface of the kingdom, and the more retired neighborhoods afford specimens of the different ranks.|$|R
50|$|Archaeology {{indicates}} that Cagayan has been inhabited {{for half a}} million years, though no human remains of any such antiquity have yet appeared.
