The experiment performed on four and two rear wheel drive of a remote control vehicle model car with variables <b>front</b> wheel <b>camber</b> angle and speed of vehicle. The result showed that negative <b>front</b> wheel <b>camber</b> angle impact could reduce the turning ability of vehicle.

50|$|Of course {{things should}} be the same, left and right, for road cars. Camber affects {{steering}} because a tire generates a force towards the side that the top is leaning towards. This is called <b>camber</b> thrust. Additional <b>front</b> negative <b>camber</b> is used to improve the cornering ability of cars with insufficient camber gain.|$|R
50|$|The Grand Caravan {{underwent}} a mid-cycle refresh for the 2011 model year, which included {{major changes in}} both styling and functionality. The suspension was heavily re-tuned, with both Dodge and Chrysler minivans gaining a larger front sway bar and new rear sway bar, increased rear roll center height, adjusted spring rates, a new steering gear, a revised <b>front</b> static <b>camber</b> setting, and lowered ride height. This dramatically improved handling in both the Chrysler and Dodge.|$|R
40|$|With {{the advent}} of smart {{materials}} it is becoming possible to alter the structural characteristics of turbomachine airfoils. This change in structural characteristics can include, but is not limited to, changes in the shape (morphing) of the airfoil. Through changes in the airfoil shape, aerodynamic performance can be improved. Moreover, this technique {{has the potential to}} act as a flutter suppressant. In this investigation changes in the airfoil <b>front</b> <b>camber</b> while maintaining the airfoil thickness distribution are made to increase airfoil stability. The airfoil section is representative of current low aspect ratio fan blade tip sections. To assess the influence of the change in airfoil shape on stability the work-per-cycle was evaluated for torsion mode oscillations around the mid-chord at an inlet Mach number of 0. 5 with an interblade phase angle of 180 degree,chordal incidence angles of both 0 degree and 10 degree, and a reduced frequency of 0. 4...|$|E
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Vehicle System Dynamics [© Taylor & Francis] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] data show that 35 % of fatal crashes in sport utility vehicles included vehicle rollover. At the same time, experimental testing to improve safety is expensive and dangerous. Therefore, multi-body simulation is used in this research to improve the understanding of rollover dynamics. The majority of previous work uses low-fidelity models. Here, a complex and highly nonlinear multi-body model with 165 degrees of freedom is correlated to vehicle kinematic and compliance (K&C) measurements. The Magic Formula tyre model is employed. Design of experiment methodology is used to identify tyre properties affecting vehicle rollover. A novel, statistical approach is used to link suspension K&C characteristics with rollover propensity. Research so far reveals that the tyre properties that have the greatest influence on vehicle rollover are friction coefficient, friction variation with load, camber stiffness and tyre vertical stiffness. Key K&C characteristics affecting rollover propensity are front and rear suspension rate, front roll stiffness, <b>front</b> <b>camber</b> gain, front and rear camber compliance and rear jacking force. © 2014 Taylor & Francis...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this research program was to investigate methods to modify the leading edge separation region, {{which could lead to}} an improvement in aeroelastic stability of advanced airfoil designs. The airfoil section used is representative of current low aspect ratio fan blade tip sections. The experimental potion of this study investigated separated zone boundary layer from removal through suction slots. Suction applied to a cavity {{in the vicinity of the}} separation onset point was found to be the most effective location. The computational study looked into the influence of <b>front</b> <b>camber</b> on flutter stability. To assess the influence of the change in airfoil shape on stability the work-per-cycle was evaluated for torsion mode oscillations. It was shown that the front camberline shape can be an important factor for stabilizing the predicted work-per-cycle and reducing the predicted extent of the separation zone. In addition, data analysis procedures are discussed for reducing data acquired in experiments that involve periodic unsteady data. This work was conducted in support of experiments being conducted in the NASA Glenn Research Center Transonic Flutter Cascade. The spectral block averaging method is presented. This method is shown to be able to account for variations in airfoil oscillation frequency that can occur in experiments that force oscillate the airfoils to simulate flutter...|$|E

50|$|See {{dependent}} and independent below.Camber changes due to wheel travel, body roll and suspension system deflection or compliance. In general, a tire wears and brakes best at -1 to -2° of camber from vertical. Depending on the tire {{and the road}} surface, it may hold the road best at a slightly different angle. Small changes in <b>camber,</b> <b>front</b> and rear, {{can be used to}} tune handling. Some race cars are tuned with -2 to -7° camber {{depending on the type of}} handling desired and the tire construction. Often, too much camber will result in the decrease of braking performance due to a reduced contact patch size through excessive camber variation in the suspension geometry. The amount of camber change in bump is determined by the instantaneous front view swing arm (FVSA) length of the suspension geometry, or in other words, the tendency of the tire to camber inward when compressed in bump.|$|R

40|$|One area {{of vehicle}} {{handling}} performance {{that has been}} the focus of an OEM{'}s (Original Equipment Manufacturer) engineering effort is within the realm of vehicle straight-line performance. As the name implies, straight-line performance is determinant on the vehicle{'}s tendency to resist vehicle lateral drift when being driven straight. Vehicle lateral drift is a condition where the driver must apply a constant correctional torque to the steering wheel in order to maintain a straight line course. A full vehicle model was developed to simulate the influences of suspension parameters on vehicle drift. Adams 2010 was chosen as the multi-body dynamics (MBD) software for this research for its ability to develop a full vehicle high fidelity model without the need for physical test data. The model was created from standard Adams/Car suspension templates modified to accommodate the subject vehicle. The front suspension sub-assembly model was built upon the front MacPherson strut suspension template. Likewise, the rear suspension sub-assembly model was created from the rear multi-link suspension template. The tire model used in the full vehicle model was based on the Pacejka 2002 formulation. A model of a similar tire was generated using a custom spreadsheet based on the PAC 2002, a slightly modified version of the Pacejka 2002 formulation found within Adams/Car. A virtual tire test rig and a 6 / 7 -DoF model were created to understand and verify the behaviour of the generated tire models. The virtual tire test rig was used to compare the outputs of the PAC 2002 tire model to the calculated values from a custom tire property spreadsheet. The 6 / 7 -DoF model was used to test and verify the effect of the tire{’}s residual lateral forces. The full-vehicle model was verified using the parallel wheel travel and opposite wheel travel suspension analyses. The parallel wheel travel analysis was used to tease out binding issues within the designed travel of the suspension. The opposite wheel travel analysis was used similarly for anti-roll bar systems. Simulations based on the industry standard vehicle drift tests were run to understand the effect of certain vehicle suspension geometry on vehicle drift, namely the vehicle{’}s <b>front</b> and rear <b>camber</b> and toe angles. The full-vehicle model was also subjected to straight-line performance simulations with various road bank or crown angles. The results were compared with industry-standard vehicle drift test data gathered by the OEM on their own test track. The results indicate that the direction of vehicle pull matches with the OEM test data, but the magnitudes differ in both the positively and negatively banked road simulation results. It is likely that the difference in vehicle drift is due to the lack of steering data obtained for the full-vehicle model...|$|R
