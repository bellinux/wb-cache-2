40|$|Most cities {{fine and}} even jail {{homeless}} people for living {{outside on the}} assumption that their alternative is to access homeless shelters. This brief finds that assumption deeply flawed. This first-ever study of shelters discloses that shelters have insufficient beds to meet the demand, and rules that bar entry to many homeless people. Most shelters only serve single males or females — they automatically exclude families, LGBTQ youth, and couples. For many then, shelters are not an alternative. The brief offers several recommendations to encourage cities to stop criminalizing homelessness and to instead pursue non-punitive alternatives.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to get new insight into the complex {{relationship}} between social inequalities and socioeconomic segregation by undertaking a comparative study North and South European cities. Our main finding shows that during the last global economic cycle from the 1980 s through the 2000 s, both levels of social inequalities and socio-economic segregation have grown. However, the effects of rising levels of inequality affect levels of segregation with a strong time lag. This reminds us that the effect of the most recent economic crisis will most likely be long-term, especially in the South of Europe. Urban Renewal and <b>Housin...</b>|$|E

40|$|Many European {{countries}} are implementing austerity measures alongside trends of welfare state retrenchment. Entrepreneurial forms of active citizenship are {{considered as a}} new form of public management to fill gaps left by spending cuts and to continue neighbourhood regeneration. Inspired by British practices, Dutch citizens are trying to set up community enterprises (CEs) to provide services or other benefits for residents in deprived neighbourhoods. Based on a qualitative panel study, this article reveals supportive responses but also resistance from local governments and housing associations. Within a positive policy discourse on co-production, institutional responses often encompass forms of ‘counter-production’ that hold CEs in full uncertainty about crucial conditions for their business.

Bureaucrats claim that consideration of potential revenues is necessary due to the increase in demand for public services from new development. In some cases, additional impact fees are imposed to cover the costs imposed on schools, parking spaces and traffic congestion.

Our results also allow us to conclude that self-reported housing satisfaction is a meaningful variable able to explain individual's objective economic behavior, since it is able to anticipate movements in the households' demand for <b>housin...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Common {{practice}} in the housing and wealth distribution literature has proceeded as if the modeling of housing rental markets was unnecessary due to renters ’ relative low levels of wealth and the small fraction they represent in the total population. This paper shows, however, that their inclusion matters substantially when dealing with wealth concentration over the life cycle. Renters are concentrated in the poorer and younger groups. This concentration results in a pattern of housing wealth concentration over an agent’s life that is decreasing, with a slope as steep as that of nonhousing (or financial) wealth. The author constructs an overlapping-generations economy with a housing rental market {{that is consistent with}} this fact.

We focus on {{the potential of the}} unfettered market forces to economize on emissions. A key finding is that these forces alone may suffice to generate an urban Environmental Kuznets Curve. In particular, reducing trade costs increases per capita incomes and generates a U-shaped evolution of emissions in the process of agglomeration and redispersion. Another key result is that agglomeration per se is typically not a boon for the environment, as total emissions in the total city system are likely to rise. city structure, city systems, environmental pollution, global warming, Environmental Kuznets Curve, trade costs, commuting costs, <b>housin...</b>|$|E
