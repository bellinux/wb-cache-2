5|$|Despite Beckham's move {{to unseat}} McCreary in the Senate, {{the two were}} once again allies by 1911, when Beckham {{supported}} the aging McCreary for the party's gubernatorial nomination. It is unclear whether McCreary sought the reconciliation {{in order to secure}} the gubernatorial nomination or Beckham made amends with McCreary because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> could control McCreary's actions as governor. In the Democratic primary, McCreary defeated William Adams by a majority of 25,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|During his {{operations}} in Isauria, Illus took Zeno's brother, Longinus, prisoner and {{kept him in}} an Isaurian fortress. Because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would have great influence over a restored Zeno, he changed sides and marched with Zeno towards Constantinople {{in the summer of}} 476. When Basiliscus received news of this danger, he hastened to recall his ecclesiastical edicts and to conciliate the Patriarch and the people, but it was too late.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many people}} of his generation, Ochs deeply admired President John F. Kennedy, even though he {{disagreed}} {{with the president on}} issues such as the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the growing involvement of the United States in the Vietnamese civil war. When Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, Ochs wept. He told his wife that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was going to die that night. It was the only time she ever saw Ochs cry.|$|E

Then he chuckled. He chuckled right out loud, then hurriedly looked {{around to see if}} any one had heard him. No one had, so he chuckled again. He cocked his head on one side and half closed his eyes, as if that plan was {{something}} he could see and he was looking at it very hard. Then he cocked his head {{on the other side and}} did the same thing.|$|R

5|$|On the November 28 {{episode of}} Raw, Maria interviewed then-Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff, {{and asked him}} whether or not <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> {{was going to be}} fired. He then booked her in a match with Kurt Angle out of spite, and Maria was laid out with the Angle Slam. As a result, one week later, Maria testified in the trial against Bischoff, who was being fired because of his {{controversial}} actions as General Manager.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{scored the}} first penalty in sudden death. Kalou then sent Van der Sar {{the wrong way}} to make it 5–5. Giggs was next up and he was also successful. Van der Sar then pulled off the crucial save for United; he pointed to his left to {{indicate}} to Nicolas Anelka that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would kick to that side, as had the six players who had kicked before him, only to correctly dive to his right to deny Anelka, whose kick was at a good height to be saved, securing European football's top prize for United {{for the third time in}} their history.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Riley's doctor {{diagnosed}} {{him with}} neurasthenia, a nervous disorder, and recommended {{long periods of}} rest as a cure. Riley remained ill {{for the rest of}} his life and relied on his landlords and family to aid in his care. During the winter months he moved to Miami, Florida, and during summer spent time with his family in Greenfield. He made only a few trips during the decade, including one to Mexico in 1906. He became very depressed by his condition, writing to his friends that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> could die at any moment, and often used alcohol for relief.|$|E

5|$|Lane advises Joan {{to demand}} a 5% {{partnership}} stake in the company, adding that, when <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was essential {{to the future of}} the firm, he settled for much less than he felt was due him. Joan later tells Pete she wants a partnership, comprising 5% of the business and voting rights, in exchange for her spending the night with Herb. Pete asks how to make the arrangements, to which she icily and rhetorically asks if she has to do it all. Pete later tells Don about the arrangement with Joan. Don visits Joan's apartment to dissuade her. She thanks him and wishes him luck on the presentation, but it is eventually revealed that, unbeknownst to Don, her sexual encounter with Herb had already taken place.|$|E
5|$|Later on, Patchy gets {{hallucinations}} and {{he finds}} a man dressed in a tall SpongeBob outfit (who is actually Tom Kenny, Patchy the Pirate's actor {{and the voice of}} SpongeBob himself), who tells him that he is SpongeBob SquarePants in real-life form. Then, Potty wakes him up after <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> is back in Encino, which is all just a dream. Patchy begins to eat a sandwich, which Potty brings to him, but he finds mayonnaise on it. He tries to give it to a vulture.|$|E
5|$|Olivier {{researched}} the role by traveling to Norfolk, Virginia {{to visit the}} MacArthur Museum, and speaking with Alexander Haig, who had served as aide-de-camp to MacArthur. Haig told Olivier that MacArthur's voice sounded like W. C. Fields, and Olivier tried to imitate this. He enjoyed working with accents, and obtained recordings of MacArthur's voice. He was interested in various inconsistencies in these recordings, {{and especially in the}} difference in vowel sounds made by MacArthur. During filming, the makeup process for Olivier took two and a half hours, but after it was complete, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> neither looked like himself nor like General MacArthur.|$|E

5|$|Robben was {{selected}} {{to play for the}} Netherlands at Euro 2012. He started in the first group stage match, a 1–0 loss to Denmark, in which he hit the post with a curled effort. In the next match, a 2–1 loss to Germany, he hopped over the advertising boards and walked the long way round after being subbed off for Dirk Kuyt because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> could have inspired the Netherlands to a win. After a 2–1 loss to Portugal, the Netherlands were knocked out with three straight defeats.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea behind}} the main plot was {{inspired}} by a scene from the novel Sometimes a Great Notion. However, the rock prop used was unpopular with the cast and crew, and post-production effects were required. The episode was the first of an ongoing plot thread with Nog entering Starfleet, which initially concerned Eisenberg as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was being written out of the show. The episode was the fourth most watched episode of the third series, with 8.3 million viewers. Critical response was mixed, with negative comments directed at the idea that the situation was created by the female Founder (Salome Jens).|$|E
5|$|When Terra's {{character}} was first revealed, 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish found {{him to be}} very similar to Zack Fair from Final Fantasy VII {{to the point where he}} wondered whether he would actually be Zack. However, when considering Terra's weapon being a Keyblade in contrast to all the other Final Fantasy characters shown in previous Kingdom Hearts games, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> may not be Zack. Amanda L. Kondolojy from Cheat Code Central found there have been various speculations regarding the similarities between Terra and Zack, but thought it would not be strange considering the existence of Nobodies in the series. Selecting Terra for a demo of Birth by Sleep IGN's Ryan Clements agreed with Parish, finding only minor differences between their outfits.|$|E

5|$|When Virgil Earp {{learned that}} Wyatt {{was talking to}} the Cowboys at Spangenberg's gun shop, he went there himself. Virgil testified {{afterward}} that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> saw all four men, Ike Clanton, Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury, and Tom McLaury, buying cartridges. Virgil went around the corner on Allen Street to the Wells Fargo office, where he picked up a 10-gauge or 12-gauge, short, double-barreled shotgun. It was an unusually cold and windy day in Tombstone, and Virgil was wearing a long overcoat. To avoid alarming Tombstone's public, Virgil hid the shotgun under his overcoat when he returned to Hafford's Saloon.|$|E
5|$|While Cipriano {{worked on}} the piece, he and his editors, Jonathan Neumann and Pulitzer Prize winner Robert Rosenthal, were {{contacted}} by Tierney. Tierney accused Ralph Cipriano of using inaccurate facts, trespassing and creating a protest at the Archdiocese's vacation home in Ventnor City, New Jersey, all of which Cipriano denies. Cipriano says that Tierney indicated to {{him that it was}} the Archdiocese that had gotten him removed from the religion reporter position, a position Cipriano says <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> left on his own. Also according to Cipriano, Tierney indicated that if Cipriano was involved in any story about the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, Tierney would start a public relations campaign to ruin Cipriano and The Philadelphia Inquirer, a charge that Tierney denies.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} police that Sheila was {{familiar}} with guns {{and that they had}} gone target shooting together. He said he had been at the farmhouse himself a few hours earlier, and that he had loaded the rifle because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had heard rabbits outside. He had left it on the kitchen table fully loaded, with a box of ammunition nearby. After the bodies were discovered, a Dr. Craig, was called to the house to certify the deaths, which he testified could have occurred {{at any time during the}} night. He said Bamber appeared to be in a state of shock; Bamber broke down, cried and seemed to vomit. The doctor said Bamber told him about the discussion the family had had about possibly having Sheila's sons placed in foster care.|$|E

5|$|Black's fellow Group members {{arrive to}} help, {{though he had}} not yet {{contacted}} any of them. They set up roadblocks throughout the city but are unsuccessful in finding Catherine. Black returns home, where his colleague Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) tells him about trying to conceive a son with his wife. Watts had once been assigned to a child-murder case in which the dismembered infant's body had been found in a cooler. He believed that God would reward him with his longed-for son if he could find the killer—years later, he still only has his three daughters, which has caused him to realize it is impossible to sacrifice one thing to gain another. Watts then has a Group member install software on Black's computer, allowing him access to sensitive documents—Black comments that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> already had full access before. Watts also explains that the Group's interest in Black is the reason for the Polaroid Man's actions. Elsewhere, the Polaroid Man ties up Catherine in a dark room.|$|E
5|$|Finn and Jake {{grab hold}} of the {{captured}} Lich as he is transported to the Citadel. Once there, they discover a human figure encased in a crystal-like substance, who they conclude must be Finn's father. Meanwhile, the Lich uses his malevolent magic to begin melting the Citadel and turning its prisoners to his will. Finn's father, Martin (voiced by Stephen Root), is eventually freed by the Lich's actions, and as the Citadel guardians battle the escaping prisoners he, Finn, and Jake try to escape. One of the Citadel guardians, however, uses its laser and melts away part of Martin's flesh on his leg. Finn retrieves some guardian blood, which repairs and heals Martin. However, Finn starts to realize that his father is not the hero that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would be.|$|E
5|$|In late March, the code-breakers at the Far East Combined Bureau, {{a branch}} of Bletchley Park, {{informed}} Somerville that the Japanese were planning a raid into the Indian Ocean to attack Colombo and Trincomalee and destroy his fleet. He therefore divided his fleet into two groups: Force A, which consisted of the two fleet carriers, Warspite and four cruisers, and Force B, centred on Royal Sovereign and her sisters and the carrier Hermes. He intended to ambush Nagumo's fleet in a night action, the only method by which <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> could achieve a victory. After three days of searching for the Japanese fleet without success, Somerville returned to Addu Atoll to refuel. While refuelling his ships, Somerville received a report that the Japanese fleet was approaching Colombo, which they attacked the following day, on 5 April, followed by attacks on Trincomalee on 9 April.|$|E
