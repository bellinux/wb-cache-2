The rights {{of women and men}} to have equal pay and equal benefits for equal work were openly denied by the British Hong Kong Government up to the early 1970s. Leslie Wah-Leung Chung (鍾華亮, 1917–2009), President of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants' Association 香港政府華員會 (1965–68), contributed to the establishment of equal pay for men and women, including the right for married women to be permanent employees. Before this, the job status of a woman changed from permanent employee to temporary employee once she was married, thus losing the pension benefit. Some of them even lost their jobs.

40|$|Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) {{has been}} the focus of much {{attention}} because it is used in large amounts and was reportedly relatively recalcitrant to bioreme-diation or natural attenuation. Beginning with a <b>few</b> papers a <b>decade</b> <b>ago,</b> evidence has been presented that, in fact, under suitable conditions it is amenable to bioremediation. Many species from widely disparate microbial genera are able to consume it either as a sole carbon source or as a cometabolite. Optimal conditions differ from site to site. Both aerobic and anaerobic conditions may permit MTBE degradation, with a range of electron acceptors, from oxygen through Fe(III), Mn(IV), sulfate, nitrate, and methanogenesis. MTBE metabolism in the vadose zone can be highly active. The published literature suggests that natural populations are adapting to MTBE, and reported rates of biodegradation appear to be larger in the more recent literature. Plants may serve as efficient conduits to withdraw MTBE from the wet subsurface, releasing it to the atmosphere or the vadose zone, where it may be metabolized or diffuse into the atmosphere where it is quickly photodegraded.

Deshastha caste-fellow Dnyaneshwar and his entire family were stripped of their caste and excommunicated by the Deshasthas because of his father's return from sanyasa to family life.

This rate of retreat has also increased since 1980, with 30%, or , of the total retreat occurring in the last 20% of the time period. The Morteratsch Glacier in Switzerland has had one of the longest periods of scientific study with yearly measurements of the glacier's length commencing in 1878. The overall retreat from 1878 to 1998 has been [...] with a mean annual retreat rate of approximately [...] per year. This long-term average was markedly surpassed in recent years with the glacier receding [...] per year during the period between 1999–2005. Similarly, of the glaciers in the Italian Alps, only about a third were in retreat in 1980, while by 1999, 89% of these glaciers were retreating. In 2005, the Italian Glacier Commission found that 123 glaciers in Lombardy were retreating. A random study of the Sforzellina Glacier in the Italian Alps indicated that the rate of retreat from 2002 to 2006 was much higher than in the preceding 35years. To study glaciers located in the alpine regions of Lombardy, researchers compared a series of aerial and ground images taken from the 1950s through the early 21st century and deduced that between the years 1954-2003 the mostly smaller glaciers found there lost more than half of their area. Repeat photography of glaciers in the Alps indicates that there as been significant retreat since studies commenced.|$|E

Although today’s students may not realize it, even the increased presence {{of women in the}} discipline is a fairly recent phenomenon. In 1960, only 17. 5 % of all doctoral degrees in psychology in the United States were awarded to women.

Female students are now the majority in most psychology classrooms in North America. However, despite this shift, in the increasingly antifeminist, neoliberal environment that surrounds us, the future of courses and programs on women and gender, especially feminist ones, is at risk. Given this context, it seems especially important to educate students about the short history, but long past, of women and feminism in psychology. Even though feminist psychology did not coalesce until the 1970 s, women (many of whom identified as feminists) have long been active and important contributors to psychology.
