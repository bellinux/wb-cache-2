40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} whether diastolic dysfunction predicts <b>in-hospital</b> <b>death</b> <b>in</b> ischemic stroke patients with atrial fibrillation. Method: We retrospectively analyzed data fromenrolled patients with ischemic stroke patients with atrial fibrillation who presented within 24 h of onset. All patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography to evaluate diastolic filling pressure estimated as the ratio of early transmitral flow velocity (E) to mitral annular velocity (e') within 24 h of admission. Weevaluated initial ischemic lesion volume andNational Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score. Results: Two hundred and sixty-six patients were enrolled. During hospitalization, 30 patients (11 %) died. The deceased group had a higher NIHSS score, a higher D-dimer level, a higher creatinine level, a larger initial ischemic lesion volumeand a higher E/e' ratio than those in the survival group. In amultivariate analysis, a higher E/e' ratio was an independent predictor of in-hospital death.

40|$|SummaryObjectivesWe {{studied the}} {{clinical}} characteristics, in-hospital mortality, and long-term {{prognosis of patients}} with culture-negative endocarditis. MethodsIn total, 221 episodes of definite endocarditis were studied (2004 – 2009). We compared the clinical, laboratory, and echocardiography characteristics and the survival rates of patients with culture-negative and culture-positive endocarditis. Survival after hospital discharge was evaluated using the Kaplan–Meier method and coefficient of mortality comparisons. ResultsCulture-negative endocarditis occurred in 51 / 221 (23. 1 %) episodes. Compared with the culture-positive endocarditis patients, the time elapsed between admission and initiation of antibiotic therapy was longer in patients with culture-negative endocarditis (p< 0. 001), and these patients also had lower C-reactive protein levels at admission (p< 0. 001). In-hospital mortality rates were not different between culture-negative and culture-positive patients. After hospital discharge, there was also no significant difference between groups in survival curves (p= 0. 471). Severe sepsis (adjusted prevalence ratio 3. 32, p= 0. 010) and diabetes mellitus (adjusted prevalence ratio 2. 32, p= 0. 009) were independently associated with <b>in-hospital</b> <b>death</b> <b>in</b> culture-negative patients.

40|$|AbstractBackground: It {{has been}} known for nearly 20 years that, in {{cardiovascular}} operations, a significant inverse relationship exists between clinical outcomes and the volume of procedures performed. Interestingly, this relationship persists 2 decades after it was recognized. Objective: The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the relationship between hospital volume and <b>in-hospital</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>in</b> 3 cardiovascular procedures: coronary artery bypass grafting, elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms, and repair of congenital cardiac defects. Methods: The database includes all patients who were hospitalized in New York State during the years 1990 to 1995. Using standard logistic regression techniques, we analyzed the relationship between hospital volume and outcome. Results: No correlation exists between hospital volume and <b>in-hospital</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>in</b> coronary artery bypass grafting. Statewide, 31 hospitals performed 97, 137 operations over the 6 -year period (overall mortality rate, 2. 75 %). By contrast, most of the hospitals statewide (195 of 230 hospitals) performed 9847 elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs with an overall mortality rate of 5. 5 %. In abdominal aortic aneurysm operations, a significant inverse relationship between hospital volume and <b>in-hospital</b> <b>deaths</b> was determined. Sixteen hospitals performed 7199 repairs for congenital cardiac defects. A significant inverse relationship (which was most pronounced for neonates) was found between volume and death. Conclusions: The importance of these findings lies in the rather striking difference between the volume-outcome relationship found for operations for abdominal aortic aneurysms and congenital cardiac defects and the lack of such a relationship for coronary artery bypass grafting. This observation may be largely explained by the quality improvement program in New York State for bypass operations since 1989. If so, these results have important implications for expanding the scope of quality improvement efforts in New York State. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1999; 117 : 419 - 30...|$|R

We sought to compare clinical outcomes of early surgery with conventional treatment in IE patients with embolic indications only. Methods and Results—From 1998 to 2006, we prospectively enrolled 132 consecutive patients (86 men; age, 4917 years) with definite IE. Patients were included {{if they had}} a left-sided native valve endocarditis with vegetation. The choice of early surgery or conventional treatment was at the discretion of attending physician. Early surgery was performed on 64 patients (OP group) within 7 days of diagnosis, and conventional management was chosen for 68 patients (CONV group). The OP group had larger vegetations and a higher percentage of patients with severe valvular disease (88 % versus 62 %, P 0. 001). During initial hospitalization, there were no embolic events and 2 <b>in-hospital</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>in</b> the OP group and 14 embolic events and 2 <b>in-hospital</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>in</b> the CONV group. During a median follow-up of 1402 days, there were 2 cardiovascular deaths, 2 embolic events, and 1 recurrence of IE in the CONV group, and 1 cardiovascular death and 2 embolic events in the OP group. The 5 -year event-free survival rate was significantly higher in the OP group (933 %) than in the CONV group (735 %, P 0. 0016). For 44 propensity score–matched pairs, the OP group had a lower event rate (hazard ratio, 0. 18; P 0. 007).

40|$|Background: Anemia on {{admission}} {{is a powerful}} predictor of major cardiovascular events in patients presenting for acute coronary syndromes. We sought to determine the prevalence and prognostic impact of anemia in patients presenting for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Methods: We analyzed data from a Tunisian retrospective single center STEMI registry. Patients were enrolled between January 1998 and October 2014. Anemic and nonanemic patients were compared for clinical and prognostic features and according to four prespecified hemoglobin level subgroups. In patients with severe anemia, factors associated with in-hospital death were studied. Results: A total of 1498 patients were enrolled. Mean age was 60. 47  ±  12. 7  years and prevalence of anemia was 36. 6 %. Anemic patients {{were more likely to}} be elderly, hypertensive, and diabetic in comparison to nonanemic patients. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in anemic patients (14. 9 % vs. 5 %, p <  0. 001). Lower hemoglobin levels were significantly associated with a higher prevalence of heart failure on admission, cardiogenic shock, and in-hospital mortality (p <  0. 001 for all). In univariate analysis, factors associated with <b>in-hospital</b> <b>death</b> <b>in</b> patients with severe anemia were hypertension (p =  0. 044), heart failure on admission (p <  0. 001), renal failure on admission (p <  0. 001), and primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) use (p =  0. 016). The absence of pPCI use was independently associated with <b>in-hospital</b> <b>death</b> <b>in</b> multivariate analysis (odds ratio =  2. 22, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 07 – 4. 76, p =  0. 033).

We sought to measure the accuracy of this rate by examining death certificates. MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional validation study by using a random sample of death certificates that recorded <b>in-hospital</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>in</b> New York City from January through June 2003, stratified by neighborhoods with low, medium, and high coronary heart disease death rates. We abstracted data from hospital records, and an independent, blinded medical team reviewed these data to validate cause of death. We computed a comparability ratio (coronary heart disease deaths recorded on death certificates divided by validated coronary heart disease deaths) to quantify agreement between death certificate determination and clinical judgment. ResultsOf 491 sampled <b>death</b> certificates for <b>in-hospital</b> <b>deaths,</b> medical charts were abstracted and reviewed by the expert panel for 444 (90 %). The comparability ratio for coronary heart disease deaths among decedents aged 35 to 74 years was 1. 51, indicating that death certificates overestimated coronary heart disease <b>deaths</b> <b>in</b> this age group by 51 %.

40|$|Hypothesis Admission blood alcohol {{concentration}} (BAC) {{is associated}} with <b>in-hospital</b> <b>death</b> <b>in</b> patients with severe brain injury from blunt head trauma. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Academic level I trauma center in Toronto, Ontario. Patients Using trauma registry data, between January 1, 1988, and December 31, 2003, we identified 1158 consecutive patients with severe brain injury from blunt head trauma. Intervention There was no active intervention. The primary exposure of interest was the BAC at admission, stratified into the following 3 levels: 0, no BAC; 0 to less than 230 mg/dL, low to moderate BAC; and 230 mg/dL or greater, high BAC. Main Outcome Measure In-hospital death. Results In patients with severe brain injury, low to moderate BAC was associated with lower mortality than was no BAC (27. 9 % vs 36. 3 %; P = 3 D. 008). High BAC was associated with higher mortality than was no BAC (44. 7 % vs 36. 3 %), although this {{was not statistically significant}} (P = 3 D. 10). These associations were all statistically significant after adjusting for demographic data and injury factors using logistic regression analysis. The odds ratio for death was 0. 76 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 52 - 0. 98) for low to moderate BAC compared with no BAC. The odds ratio for death was 1. 73 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 05 - 2. 84) for high BAC compared with no BAC. Conclusions Low to moderate BAC may be beneficial in patients with severe brain injury from blunt head trauma. In contrast, high BAC seems to have a deleterious effect on <b>in-hospital</b> <b>death</b> <b>in</b> these patients, which may be related to its detrimental hemodynamic and physiologic effects.

40|$|Background: NADPH oxidase is an {{important}} enzyme involved in the generation of reactive oxygen species in acute kidney injury (AKI). Its key subunit, p 22 phox, is encoded by the highly polymorphic CYBA gene. Methods: We examined the associations of CYBA gene polymorphisms across the CYBA locus (rs 8854, rs 3794624, rs 4673, rs 4782390, and rs 1049255) with dialysis requirement or <b>in-hospital</b> <b>death</b> <b>in</b> 256 hospitalized adults with AKI. Dominant and haplotype multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed, adjusted for sex, race, age, and severity of illness. Results: The baseline characteristics of the patients were not different among genotype groups {{with the exception of}} a lower prevalence of sepsis and shock in the CYBA rs 8854 A-allele group; a higher prevalence of shock in the CYBA rs 4782390 T-allele group, and a higher APACHE II score in the CYBA rs 1049255 G-allele group. The CYBA rs 8854 A-allele had an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0. 41 (95 % confidence interval, CI, 0. 18 – 0. 96) for the outcome of dialysis requirement or in-hospital death. The CYBA rs 4673 T-allele and rs 1049255 G-allele had unadjusted ORs of 1. 69 (95 % CI 1. 03 – 2. 79) and 1. 66 (95 % CI 1. 01 – 2. 73) for the composite outcome, respectively, which became non-significant after multivariable adjustment. The remaining 2 polymorphisms were not associated with the outcomes of interest. Finally, the presence of the CYBA A-A-G-G haplotype (generated from rs 4782390, rs 4673, rs 3794624, and rs 8854, all in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium) was associated with an elevated OR of 1. 81 (95 % CI 1. 07 – 3. 08) for dialysis requirement or in-hospital death, which was attenuated after multivariable adjustment (OR 1. 80; 95 % CI 0. 99 – 3. 29). Conclusion: This study identifies several polymorphisms spanning the entire CYBA gene locus and a common haplotype as risk markers for dialysis requirement or <b>in-hospital</b> <b>death</b> <b>in</b> patients with AKI.

Although early revascularization strategies have resulted in a better prognosis, in-hospital mortality from CS remains exceptionally high. Notably, long-term annual mortality is similar in survivors of CS relative to patients with myocardial infarction without shock. This underlines the importance of aggressive support of the failing heart in the acute phase of CS. Because CS reflects a state of hypoperfusion induced by heart failure, management of CS should aim at improving cardiac function as well as at optimization of tissue perfusion. This review evaluates the current treatment of CS. In addition, novel approaches to monitor and modulate peripheral circulation at the bedside are highlighted. It is expected that these techniques will improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of CS and will offer new opportunities to guide therapy in CS patients to improve long-term prognosi...|$|E

Distended intestines and loss of grey-white matter differentiation in the brain showed a significant correlation with postmortem time interval (p = 0. 001, p< 0. 001). Hyperdense cerebral vessels, intravenous clotting, subcutaneous edema, fluid in the abdomen and internal livores of the liver were seen more in ICU patients. Longer postmortem time interval led to a significant increase in decomposition related changes (p = 0. 026). There is a wide variety of imaging features of postmortem change <b>in</b> <b>in-hospital</b> <b>deaths.</b> These imaging features vary among clinical conditions, increase with longer postmortem time interval and must be distinguished from pathologic changes...|$|R
40|$|Venous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE) is {{a significant}} source of mortality, morbidity, disability, and impaired health-related quality of life in the world. |We aimed to evaluate the clustering patterns and associations of 29 comorbidities with <b>in-hospital</b> <b>death</b> among adult hospitalizations with a diagnosis of VTE in the United States by analyzing data from the 2009 Nationwide Inpatient Sample. |This cross-sectional study included 153, 124 adult hospitalizations with a diagnosis of VTE. Adjusted rate ratios and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for <b>in-hospital</b> <b>death</b> were generated by using multivariable log-linear regression models to measure independent associations between comorbidities and <b>in-hospital</b> <b>death.</b> |We estimated that 44, 200 <b>in-hospital</b> <b>deaths</b> occurred <b>in</b> 2009 among 773, 273 US adult hospitalizations with a diagnosis of VTE. Subgroups of hospitalizations with comorbidities of "congestive heart failure," "chronic pulmonary disease," "coagulopathy," "liver disease," "lymphoma," "fluid and electrolyte disorders," "metastatic cancer," "peripheral vascular disorders," "pulmonary circulation disorders," "renal failure," "solid tumor without metastasis," or "weight loss" were positively and independently associated with 1. 07 (95 % CI: 1. 02 - 1. 12) to 2. 06 (95 % CI: 1. 97 - 2. 16) times increased likelihoods of <b>in-hospital</b> <b>death,</b> when compared to those without the corresponding comorbidities. The clustering patterns of these comorbidities by 4 disease categories (i. e., "cancer," "cardiovascular/respiratory/blood," "gastrointestinal/urologic," and "nutritional/bodyweight") were associated with 2. 74 to 10. 28 times increased likelihoods of <b>in-hospital</b> <b>death,</b> as compared to hospitalizations without any of these comorbidities. The overall increase in the cumulative number of comorbidities corresponded to significantly elevated risks (P-trend< 0. 01) for <b>in-hospital</b> <b>death</b> among hospitalizations with a diagnosis of VTE. |The presence of multiple comorbidities is ubiquitous among hospitalizations of adults with VTE and among <b>in-hospital</b> <b>deaths</b> with VTE <b>in</b> the United States. The findings of our study further suggest that, among hospitalizations of adults with VTE, the presence of certain comorbidities or clustering of these comorbidities significantly elevates the risk of <b>in-hospital</b> <b>death...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to explore the {{association}} of dementia with in-hospital OBJECTIVE:The {{aim of the}} study was to explore the association of dementia with <b>in-hospital</b> <b>death</b> <b>in</b> acutely ill medical patients. METHODS: Thirty-four internal medicine and 4 geriatric wards in Italy participated in the Registro Politerapie SIMI-REPOSI-study during 2008. One thousand three hundred and thirty two in-patients aged 65 years or older were enrolled. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association of dementia with in-hospital death. Socio-demographic characteristics, morbidity (single diseases and the Charlson Index), number of drugs, and adverse clinical events during hospitalization were considered as potential confounders. RESULTS: One hundred and seventeen participants were diagnosed as being affected by dementia. Patients with dementia were more likely to be women, older, to have cerebrovascular diseases, pneumonia, and a higher number of adverse clinical events during hospitalization. The percentage of patients affected by dementia who died during hospitalization was higher than that of patients without dementia (9. 4 versus 4. 9...|$|E
40|$|The {{main cause}} of <b>in-hospital</b> <b>death</b> <b>in</b> {{patients}} with acute myocardial infarction is the "power failure syndrome". Hemodynamic monitoring provides precise and current data on the filling and output status of the left ventricle and, when indicated, the right ventricle. The information obtained is {{used to determine the}} hemodynamic status more precisely than is possible from conventional clinical assessment. It permits categorization of patients by hemodynamic status; the hemodynamic subset classification of Forrester, Diamond and Swan is a powerful tool in guiding therapy and establishing prognosis in individual patients. In addition to guiding the initiation of therapy, hemodynamic monitoring is useful in the continuing assessment of potent and complex treatment. This therapy is directed at resolving hemodynamic derangements without unfavourably altering the myocardial oxygen supply-demand relationship. Specific clinical indications for hemodynamic monitoring may include confusing or complicated clinical situations in which diagnostic problems exist, complicating mechanical derangements, severe congestive heart failure, cardiogenic shock and clinical research in acute myocardial infarction...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective. To {{evaluate}} five risk scoring {{methods in}} predicting the immediate postoperative outcome after elective open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Design. Retrospective evaluation of the Eagle score, Glasgow aneurysm score, Leiden score, modified Leiden score and Vanzetto score in a consecutive series of patients. Patients. Two hundred and eighty-six consecutive patients undergoing elective infrarenal aortic aneurysm repair. Results. Nine patients (3. 1 %) died in hospital and another 35 (12 %) experienced severe postoperative complications. For the Glasgow aneurysm score, Leiden score, modified Leiden score and Vanzetto score receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis for prediction of in-hospital mortality showed area under the curve (AUC) of 0. 749 (p= 0. 01), 0. 777 (p= 0. 008), 0. 788 (p= 0. 006) and 0. 794 (p= 0. 005), respectively. The Eagle risk score was less accurate for predicting in-hospital mortality. The risk-scoring systems did not perform well in predicting post-operative complications, but multivariate analysis showed that the modified Leiden score was an independent predictor of postoperative complications. Conclusion. All scoring systems predict, with reasonable accuracy, the risk of <b>in-hospital</b> <b>death</b> <b>in</b> patients undergoing elective open repair of AAA, whereas the accuracy in predicting severe postoperative complications is less...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports the}} results of a questionnaire-based survey of {{pancreatic}} surgical specialists in the United Kingdom addressing aspects of staging, resection volume and outcome. A postal survey was undertaken of the 517 members of the Association of upper Gastrointestinal Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland (AUGIS). 57 surgeons undertook pancreatic resection from 162 overall respondents. Cross-checking with the list of members of the Pancreatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland yielded 64 pancreatic surgeons. 734 pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) were reported by respondents compared with 822 procedures according to Government maintained Hospital Episode Statistics. The modal resection volume performed per annum was 6 – 10. There were 24 <b>in-hospital</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>in</b> 732 resections (3 %) mortality. For individual respondents the modal percentage mortality was 5 % (0 to 16 %). All clinicians with mortality rates in excess of 10 % did less than 10 resections per annum. Respondents favoured “amylase rich discharge beyond 7 th post-operative day” as optimal for definition of post-resection pancreatic fistula. Accepting the limitations of questionnaire surveys, the results provide an important overview of pancreatic surgical practice: pancreaticoduodenectomy is carried out by a range of specialists, lower volume resectionists appear to have poorer outcomes and this study shows widespread agreement on optimum terminology for post-operative pancreatic fistula...|$|R
40|$|To report our {{experience}} of intracardiac surgery with an inverted J-shaped partial sternotomy (IJPS) and describe the technical details of this approach. Methods: From January to December 2002, 31 patients underwent intracardiac operations using the IJPS instead of a standard conventional full-length median sternotomy (FLMS). Twenty-one patients had mitral valve replacements (MVR), with combined tricuspid valvuloplasty in three, six had closure of secundum atrial septal defects, three had closure of ventricular septal defects and one had repair of cor triatriatum. Data from 26 randomly selected patients who had undergone MVR through a conventional FLMS were included for comparison. Results: There were no perioperative or <b>in-hospital</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>in</b> either group. There {{was a significant difference}} between the two MVR groups in incision length, mediastinal drainage and blood transfusion volume, but not in cardiopulmonary bypass time, aortic cross-clamp time, duration of operation and duration of ventilatory support. There were no conversions from IJPS to FLMS, indicating that access was satisfactory for all the procedures. All patients were discharged without any significant postoperative complications. Conclusion: The IJPS is aesthetically pleasing with regard to cosmesis and does not affect safety and exposure. Furthermore, the smaller incision resulted in a significant reduction in blood loss and blood requirements...|$|R
40|$|Setting. The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} at the Department of Pulmonology at a public, tertiary care centre in Karachi, Pakistan. Objectives. To evaluate factors concerned with <b>in-hospital</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>in</b> patients admitted with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Design. A retrospective case-control audit was performed for 120 patients hospitalised with pulmonary TB. Sixty of those discharged after treatment {{were compared to}} sixty who did not survive. Radiological findings, clinical indicators, and laboratory values were compared {{between the two groups}} to identify factors related to poor prognosis. Results. Factors concerned with in-hospital mortality listed late presentation of disease (P< 0. 01), noncompliance to antituberculosis therapy (P< 0. 01), smoking (P< 0. 01), longer duration of illness prior to treatment (P< 0. 01), and low body weight (P< 0. 01). Most deaths occurred {{during the first week of}} admission (P< 0. 01) indicating late referrals as significant. Immunocompromised status and multi-drug resistance were not implicated in higher mortality. Conclusions. Poor prognosis was associated with noncompliance to therapy resulting in longer duration of illness, late patient referrals to care centres, and development of complications. Early diagnosis, timely referrals, and monitored compliance may help reduce mortality. Adherence to a more radically effective treatment regimen is required to eliminate TB early during disease onset...|$|R
