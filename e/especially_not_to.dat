Therefore, In 424, the bishops of the Sasanian Empire met in council under the leadership of Catholicos Dadishoʿ (421–456) and determined that they would not, henceforth, refer disciplinary or theological problems to any external power, and <b>especially</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> any bishop or Church Council in the Roman Empire.|$|E
25|$|Genie's {{father had}} an {{extremely}} low tolerance {{for any kind}} of noise, refusing to have a working television or radio in the house. Apart from one slightly open window Genie did not have any access to auditory stimuli outside the house, and the window was set well away from the street and other houses, so what little she heard from outside almost exclusively consisted of environmental sounds. Her father never allowed other people in the house, forbade any interaction between Genie and her mother, and forced his son to assist with carrying out his abuse while otherwise preventing him from being in Genie's presence. He did not permit them to speak, and <b>especially</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> or around Genie, so any conversations they had were out of Genie's earshot, keeping her from hearing any meaningful amount of language.|$|E
25|$|Duterte {{has said}} that he was sexually abused by a priest when he was a minor. After he was {{challenged}} by the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) and AdDU officials to name the priest and file a case against him, Duterte then revealed the priest's name as Fr. Mark Falvey, SJ (d. 1975). The Jesuits of the Society of Jesus in the Philippines confirmed that according to press reports in the United States, in May 2007, the Society of Jesus agreed to a tentative payout of USD16 million to settle claims that Falvey sexually abused at least nine children in Los Angeles from 1959 to 1975. Accusations against Falvey began in 2002 and he was never charged with a crime. Additionally in May 2008, the Diocese of Sacramento paid $100,000 settlement to a person allegedly raped and molested by Mark's brother, Fr. Arthur Falvey. However, it was not clearly indicated in the report if Mark Falvey was assigned at the Jesuit-run Ateneo de Davao. When asked why he didn't complain when the abuse supposedly happened, Duterte claimed that he was too young to complain about the priest's abuse and was intimidated by authorities at that time. He also stated that he never disclosed that information after he was expelled and moved to a different high school and <b>especially</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> his family.|$|E

She also discovered that young men, including her brothers, shared the feeling of shame over losing to girls. She recalls, 'Whenever my brother Paul, the youngest of my four brothers, beat me at pool on the table downstairs at home, he would run through the house shouting 'I won, I beat her'. I guess that was one reason I worked all the harder at my game.'" ...|$|E

Dimato later tried to bribe Naomi and Brennan encouraged {{her to go to}} the police, but she refused and gave the money back. Brennan confronted Dimato, who then cornered Naomi and threatened her for talking about the bribe. O'Reilly commented that Naomi was annoyed at Brennan's interference, as she felt she could handle Dimato. She continued, [...] "She's tough as nails. She would never admit there is danger there – and <b>especially</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> Brennan!" [...] Matt Turner (Josef Brown) later asked for Naomi's help, so the police could build a case against Dimato. Naomi gave a statement even though she was still receiving threats from Dimato and his men. Dimato later targeted Sheila, forcing Naomi to retract her statement. Matt tried to get her to change her mind, but it was only when Sheila learned what she had done and told her to re-submit her statement, that Naomi agreed.|$|E
2500|$|The University of Chicago {{developed}} the major sociologists at the time. It brought them together, and even {{gave them a}} hub and a network to link all the leading sociologists. In 1925, {{a third of all}} sociology graduate students attended the University of Chicago. Chicago was very good at not isolating their students from other schools. They encouraged them to blend with other sociologists, and to not spend more time in the class room than studying the society around them. [...] This would teach them real life application of the classroom teachings. The first teachings at the University of Chicago were focused on the social problems that the world had been dealt. At this time, academia was not concerned with theory; <b>especially</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> the point that academia is today. Many people were still hesitant of sociology at this time, especially with the recent controversial theories of Weber and Marx. The University of Chicago decided to go into an entirely different direction and their sociology department directed their attention to the individual and promoted equal rights. Their concentration was small groups and discoveries of the individual’s relationship to society. The program combined with other departments to offer students well-rounded studies requiring courses in hegemony, economics, psychology, multiple social sciences and political science. Albion Small {{was the head of the}} sociology program at the University of Chicago. He played a key role in bringing German sociological advancements directly into American academic sociology. Small also created the American Journal of Sociology. [...] Robert Park and Ernest Burgess refined the program’s methods, guidelines, and checkpoints. This made the findings more standardized, concise and easier to comprehend. The pair even wrote the sociology program’s textbook for a reference and get all students on the same page more effectively. Many remarkable sociologists such as George Hebert Mead, W.E. Du Bois, Robert Park, Charles S. Johnson, William Ogburn, Hebert Blumer and many others have significant ties to the University of Chicago.|$|E

6000|$|July 31, 1842.--Walk with R. Williams to {{converse}} {{on the subject}} [...] of our recent letters. I made it my object to learn from him the [...] general view of the ulterior section of the Oxford writers and [...] their friends. It is startling. They look not merely to the renewal [...] {{and development of the}} catholic idea within the pale of the church [...] of England, but seem to consider the main condition of that [...] development and of all health (some tending even to say of all [...] life) to be reunion with the church, of Rome as the see of Peter. [...] They recognise, however, authority in the church of England, and [...] abide in her without love specifically fixed upon her, to seek the [...] fulfilment of this work of reunion. It is, for example, he said, [...] the sole object of Oakeley's life. They do not look to any defined [...] order of proceedings in the way of means. They consider that the [...] end is to be reached through catholicising the mind of the members [...] of the church of England, but do not seem to feel that this can be [...] done to any great degree in working out and giving free scope to [...] her own rubrical system. They have no strong feeling of revulsion [...] from actual evils in the church of Rome, first, because they do not [...] wish to judge; secondly, <b>especially</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> judge the saints; [...] thirdly, they consider that infallibility is somewhere and nowhere [...] but there. They could not remain in the church of England if they [...] thought that she dogmatically condemned anything that the church of [...] Rome has defined de fide, but they do and will remain on the [...] basis of the argument of Tract 90; upon which, after mental [...] conflict, they have settled steadily down. They regret what Newman [...] has said strongly against the actual system of the church of Rome, [...] and they could not have affirmed, though neither do they positively [...] deny it. Wherever Roman doctrine de fide is oppugned they must [...] protest; but short of this they render absolute obedience to their [...] ecclesiastical superiors in the church of England. They expect to [...] work on in practical harmony with those who look mainly to the [...] restoration of catholic ideas on the foundation laid by the church [...] of England as reformed, and who take a different view as to reunion [...] with Rome in particular, though of course desiring the reunion of [...] the whole body of Christ. All this is matter for very serious [...] consideration. In the meantime I was anxious to put it down while [...] fresh.|$|E
