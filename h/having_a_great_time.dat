Ann also reveals she has broken up with Andy (Chris Pratt). Mark and Leslie kissed before he fell, but both insist they are just friends. Mark tries to ask Ann out, but she declines {{out of respect for}} Leslie's friendship. Meanwhile, the Bulge holds a party in Leslie's honor, which she attends along with Tom (Aziz Ansari) to announce she has not taken a political stand. However, she accepts the free drinks they offer her and ends up getting drunk and <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>time.</b> The next day, she is invited to go on the Pawnee Today talk show to discuss her supposed stance on same-sex marriage with Marcia Langman and television host Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins).|$|E
500|$|The {{appearance}} of bikinis kept increasing both on screen and off. The sex appeal prompted {{film and television}} productions, including Dr. Strangelove. They include the surf movies of the early 1960s. In 1960, Brian Hyland's song [...] "Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini" [...] inspired a bikini-buying spree. By 1963, the movie Beach Party, starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon, followed by Muscle Beach Party (1964), Bikini Beach (1964), [...] and Beach Blanket Bingo (1965) that depicted teenage girls wearing bikinis, frolicking in the sand with boys, and <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was largely positive. Sava awarded the episode a [...] "B+", and wrote that Ricardio is [...] "always welcome on this series, {{largely due to}} Takei’s delightful voice work." [...] Furthermore, he praised the way that Takei delivered his lines, noting that [...] "there’s a theatrical smarminess to his vocals that is {{a stark contrast to}} the Ice King’s nasality", and that [...] "Takei always sounds like he’s <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>time</b> reading the ridiculous lines that are written for him." [...] Sava also wrote positively of Bubblegum's character, noting that she [...] "dominates this episode" [...] and that the [...] "episode reveals a side of her that we rarely see, and hopefully we’ll get more of badass PB in the future." ...|$|E

500|$|Bhatti {{was already}} known to EastEnders {{executive}} producer Bryan Kirkwood when he auditioned for the part, as Kirkwood and Bhatti worked on Coronation Street {{at the same}} time. Bhatti was the only actor who auditioned for the part of Yusef. In fact, Wadia recommended Bhatti to Kirkwood to play Yusef, as she [...] "thought that he definitely had the quality that Yusef would need—which is a very ambiguous but charming quality!" [...] Bhatti explained to Digital Spy that the EastEnders cast are very welcoming. He explained: [...] "They're so welcoming. There's a lot of joking about. I'm <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>time</b> at EastEnders - it's a real privilege to be here. I've known Nitin and Nina Wadia, who plays Zainab, {{for a very long}} time and we've always got on very well. Nitin and I play tense scenes together so it's nice that we can have a laugh afterwards." ...|$|E
500|$|Takei's {{appearance}} as Ricardio gained critical favor. Charlie Anders of io9 named Takei's {{appearance in the}} episode {{as one of his}} [...] "greatest moments", noting, [...] "how could we have missed that Takei did the voice for this sleazy science-talking heart on Adventure Time, our new favorite show?" [...] Tyler Foster of DVD Talk called Ricardio {{one of the highlights of}} the season. The A.V. Club reviewer Oliver Sava, in a review for [...] "Lady & Peebles", wrote that Ricardio is [...] "always welcome on this series, largely due to Takei’s delightful voice work." [...] Furthermore, he praised the way that Takei delivered his lines, noting that [...] "there’s a theatrical smarminess to his vocals that is a stark contrast to the Ice King’s nasality", and that [...] "Takei always sounds like he’s <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>time</b> reading the ridiculous lines that are written for him." ...|$|E
500|$|Mitchell {{revealed}} that Romeo's relationship with Indigo Walker (Samara Weaving) would drift {{apart in the}} event of the [...] "love triangle" [...] storyline. Executive producer Cameron Welsh promised viewers that the storyline would play {{a big part of the}} serial in 2011. He also stated: [...] "Fans will definitely take sides on this one. Luke Mitchell, Rebecca Breeds and Samara Weaving are <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>time</b> with this storyline, and we'll see a new side to all of them as they face the consequences of their actions." [...] Breeds later explained Ruby's reasoning and the hidden issue which makes her believe she loves him so quickly stating: [...] "Ruby has a lot of insecurity because Ruby never really had a father figure. There's a lot of looking to belong and looking for love because she's had a displaced family life, and she feels like Romeo is her family. Romeo has some issues of his own. He is struggling with his relationship with Indi. The pair find themselves in a similar place of understanding." [...] After Romeo sleeps with Ruby, Mitchell said Romeo immediately regrets it. Ruby then decides to reveals the truth to Indigo. This ruins their friendship and Weaving said: [...] "I think that friendship is pretty much over now!".|$|E

It's all done with such flair and good humour that you can't help being absorbed.

2500|$|Hancock {{filled in}} for pianist Chick Corea in Mongo Santamaría's band one weekend at a nightclub in The Bronx when Corea gave {{notice that he}} was leaving. Hancock played the tune for Santamaría at friend Donald Byrd's urging. Santamaría started {{accompanying}} him on his congas, then his band joined in, and the small audience slowly got up from their tables and started dancing, laughing and <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>time.</b> Santamaría later asked Hancock if he could record the tune. On December 17, 1962, Mongo Santamaría recorded a three-minute version, suitable for radio, where he joined timbalero Francisco [...] "Kako" [...] Baster in a cha-cha beat, while drummer Ray Lucas performed a backbeat. Santamaría included the track on his album Watermelon Man (1962). Santamaría's recording is sometimes considered the beginning of Latin boogaloo, a fusion of Afro-Cuban rhythms with those of R.|$|E

2500|$|This band dynamic {{has played}} a role in their public image as well. Early in their career, the duo were {{frequently}} accused of lacking stage presence, said to be a deliberate reaction to the hyper-cheerful music of the time, demonstrated by bands such as Wham!. A typical early performance featured Lowe in the background playing the bassline on a Fairlight synthesiser keyboard and Tennant singing, but otherwise passive, in the foreground. Tennant and Lowe both became well known for standing still throughout performances. In a 2016 interview, Chris Lowe said the duo's live performances was a response to the music scene in the 1980s: [...] "Everyone was so active. It was a big party where everyone was <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>time</b> and smiling at the camera. Thumbs aloft! We just didn’t want to do that. So we ignored the cameras and the jollity of the situations. Let’s face it, it’s easier to stand stock-still isn’t it?".|$|E
2500|$|Weill {{also contributed}} {{greatly to the}} Verfremdungseffekt by his music. Often the music would {{intentionally}} be unsuited for the onstage action, preventing the audience from getting carried away by the onstage emotion. For example, in act 2, scene 13, the hurricane has spared Mahagonny, and the people feel free to do whatever makes them happy. For Jacob Schmidt, this means eating a lot. He sings of how he has not had his fill yet with such lines as [...] "Not enough by half! / I may eat myself for supper." [...] And yet, the music betrays the seeming unbridled ecstasy of Jacob; he is singing to a discordant melody, and the accordion accompaniment sounds stark and rather macabre. The intention is that the audience realizes that all this is very wrong; Jacob claims to be <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>time,</b> but the music suggests all may not be well, thus the audience needs to pay attention {{and think about what}} is really going on. To further this point, Jacob then dies and the chorus sings of how happy he was while dragging out his corpse. This last twist of welcoming death is unexpected and contributes to the alienation.|$|E
2500|$|During production, it was Gilliam's {{intention}} that {{it should}} feel like a drug trip from beginning to end. He said in an interview, [...] "We start out at full speed and it's WOOOO! The drug kicks in and you're on speed! Whoah! You get the buzz – it's crazy, it's outrageous, the carpet's moving and everybody's laughing and <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>time.</b> But then, ever so slowly, the walls start closing in and it's like you're {{never going to get}} out of this fucking place. It's an ugly nightmare and there's no escape." [...] To convey the effects of the various drugs, Gilliam and Pecorini assembled a list of [...] "phases" [...] that detailed the [...] "cinematic qualities" [...] of each drug consumed. For ether, Pecorini said they used a [...] "loose depth of field; everything becomes non-defined"; for adrenochrome, [...] "everything gets narrow and claustrophobic, move closer with lens"; mescaline was simulated by having [...] "colors melt into each other, flares with no sources, play with color temperatures"; for amyl nitrite, the [...] "perception of light gets very uneven, light levels increase and decrease during the shots"; and for LSD, [...] "everything extremely wide, hallucinations via morphs, shapes, colors, and sound." ...|$|E

2500|$|IGN's Douglass C. Perry {{reviewed}} an import {{version of}} the game prior to its release in North America, and was disappointed {{with the lack of}} depth, but impressed by [...] other aspects. He praised the graphics, character design and CGI cutscenes. He was also impressed with the [...] "glowing" [...] effect used throughout the game; [...] "DreamFactory employs a Playboy-like filter that smoothes out every single bit on the screen. The effect is consistent throughout the game, and rids the PS2 of aliasing or flickering, but also provides a unique gloss that's never been used before with such success." [...] He concluded that, [...] "despite the disappointments, I am absolutely <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>time</b> with The Bouncer." [...] In his official review of the game upon its North American release, Perry scored it 7 out of 10, writing [...] "The game is a letdown, but not a catastrophic one. [...] It's a good game, not a great one, and it's worth a look." [...] He referred to Story Mode as a [...] "mixed bag of good ideas executed ineffectively," [...] although he praised multiplayer mode. He concluded [...] "The Bouncer is not the next messiah, it's not the next wave of fighting, and frankly, it's not the paradigm for anything really new, except perhaps incredible-looking graphics. These things said, The Bouncer is a decent game. It's not horrible, it's not brilliant. It's pretty average." ...|$|E

We leaped ten or fifteen-foot gaps as a matter of course. And a twenty or twenty-five foot deliberate drop clear down to the ground was nothing to us. In fact, I am almost afraid to say the great distances we dropped. As we grew older and heavier we found we had to be more cautious in dropping, but at that age our bodies were all strings and springs and we could do anything.|$|E
