40|$|The loaded salts (NaCl, KCl, MgCl₂, and CaCl₂) have {{significantly}} different {{influence on the}} contribution of dehydration and depolymerization reactions to the decomposition of sugar structures during cellulose fast pyrolysis at 325 °C. The structures of salt-loaded celluloses already become cross-linked during <b>heating-up</b> <b>period,</b> {{largely due to the}} enhanced dehydration reactions catalyzed by inorganic species. As stronger Lewis acids, the alkaline earth metal ions (Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺) are more effective than the alkali metal ions (Na⁺ and K⁺) to catalyze the dehydration reactions of sugar structures, leading to the formation of more cross-linked cellulose for the alkaline earth metal chloride-loaded celluloses. As a result, the majority of Mg and Ca are transformed into water-insoluble forms during the <b>heating-up</b> <b>period,</b> largely reducing the catalytic effects of these species on the dehydration of sugar structures during the subsequent isothermal pyrolysis. Rather, the dehydration of non-sugar structures is enhanced because the catalytic species are already bonded with non-sugar structures. In contrast, the dehydration of sugar structures during the <b>heating-up</b> <b>period</b> is less significant for the NaCl-loaded and KCl-loaded celluloses. The majority of Na and K are water-soluble after the <b>heating-up</b> <b>period</b> so that the dehydration of sugar structures is further enhanced during isothermal pyrolysis. The loaded salts have less influence on the depolymerization reactions. The contribution of depolymerization reactions to sugar conversion is relatively small during the heating-up stage, but increases substantially during isothermal pyrolysis...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Diffusion bonding {{has been}} widely used within microlamination {{architectures}} for the fabrication of Micro Energy and Chemical Systems (MECS). MECS are microsystems {{with the ability to}} process bulk amounts of fluid within highly-parallel microchannel arrays capable of accelerated heat and mass transfer. Thus far, diffusion bonding of microchannel arrays is commonly done in a vacuum hot press system. The use of the hot press greatly restricts the production rate due to vacuum pump-down time and <b>heating-up</b> and cooling-down <b>periods.</b> Furthermore, larger substrates are gaining interest in the system design of MECS devices and it is not apparent that uniaxial pressing within a hydraulic vacuum hot press will provide the bonding pressure uniformity necessary for large substrate bonding. This thesis presents a novel fabrication approach for the high-volume thermal bonding of large substrate MECS devices with the use of controlled thermal expansion. A large substrate thermal bonding clamp based on the principle of differential thermal expansion was developed with focus on controlling the bonding pressure magnitude, timing, sensitivity and uniformity...|$|R

40|$|Kerosene is {{a common}} liquid fuel in many {{industrial}} applications. However, there is little useful data on high pressure and high tem-perature evaporation for kerosene. In this research, the vaporization of kerosene droplet was experimentally investigated at high tempera-tures (between 500 and 1000 C) and high pressures (between 0. 1 and 3. 0 MPa) under normal gravity. High temperature environment has provided by a furnace. Droplet with initial diameter between 1. 0 and 1. 2 mm was suspended {{at the tip of}} a quartz fiber. The evapor-ation process was recorded by a high-speed CCD camera. The evap-oration rate was extracted from the recorded movie by determining temporal rate of changing of droplet diameter. Despite its multicom-ponent nature, the evaporation of kerosene droplet followed the d 2 -law after <b>heating-up</b> <b>period.</b> The evaporation rate of kerosene droplet increased monotonically with an increase in gas temperature.

The {{results showed that}} active oxygen cooking process was an efficient method to depolymerize the corn stalk into cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin as a pretreatment of biomass conversion. This cooking process can also be divided into three phases: bulk delignification, extended delignification, and residual delignification.

40|$|An {{experimental}} solar steam generator, {{consisting of}} a parabolic trough collector, a high-pressure steam circuit, and a suitable flash vessel has been constructed and tested {{in order to establish}} the thermodynamic performance during heat-up. The heat-up energy requirement has a marked effect on the system's performance because solar energy collected during the <b>heating-up</b> <b>period</b> is lost at night due to the diurnal cycle. This depends mostly on the dimensions and the inventory of the flash vessel, and the prevailing environmental conditions. Experimental data were obtained and used to train an artificial neural network in order to implement a mapping between easily measurable features (environmental conditions, water content and vessel dimensions) and the system temperatures. Such mapping may be useful to system designers when seeking to find the optimal vessel-dimensions. The trained network predicted very well the response of the system, as indicated by the statistical R-squared value of 0. 999 obtained and a maximum deviation between predicted and actual values being less than 3. 9 %. This degree of accuracy is acceptable in the design of such systems. The results are important, because the system was tested during its heat-up cycle, under transient conditions, which is quite difficult to model analytically. ...|$|E

40|$|The thermal {{emission}} of alkali metal ions from Al 30 -pillared montmorillonite {{in comparison with}} its natural form was studied by mass spectrometry in the temperature range 770 – 930 [*]K. The measurements were carried out on a magnetic mass spectrometer MI- 1201. For natural montmorillonite, the densities of the emission currents (j) decrease in the mass spectrum in the following sequence (T = 805 [*]K, A/cm 2) : K+ (4. 55 · 10 − 14), Cs+ (9. 72 · 10 − 15), Rb+ (1. 13 · 10 − 15), Na+ (1. 75 · 10 − 16), Li+ (3. 37 · 10 − 17). For Al 30 -pillared montmorillonite, thermionic emission undergoes temperature-time changes. In the low-temperature section of the investigated range (770 – 805 [*]K), the value of j increases substantially for all ions in comparison with natural montmorillonite (T = 805 [*]K, A/cm 2) : Cs+ (6. 47 · 10 − 13), K+ (9. 44 · 10 − 14), Na+ (3. 34 · 10 − 15), Rb+ (1. 77 · 10 − 15), and Li+ (4. 59 · 10 − 16).

This effect increases with increasing ionic radius of M+. After a long <b>heating-up</b> <b>period,</b> this anomaly disappears and the lnj- 1 /T dependence acquires a classical linear form.

In preliminary studies, the synergistic effect of polysulfide and AQ on pulp yield improvement was verified by different methods. The identical kinetic cooking experiments were conducted for Kraft, Kraft-AQ, Polysulfide, and Polysulfide-AQ {{processes in the}} temperature range between 151 and 180 ºC. It {{was found that the}} delignification rate of the PSAQ process was the fastest. The activation energies of delignification of Kraft, Kraft-AQ, Polysulfide, and Polysulfide-AQ processes were calculated as 141, 131, 142, and 131 kJ/mol, respectively. Based on obtained activation energies, the Vroom's H-factor was calculated and compared. It was also found that Kraft, Kraft-AQ, Polysulfide, and Polysulfide-AQ processes had similar activation energies for the carbohydrate degradation by 170, 174, 176, and 181 kJ/mol. Compared with the kraft process, the carbohydrate degradation rate of the PSAQ process was reduced. In addition, compared with other processes the PSAQ process had the best pulping selectivity. A mechanism was proposed for the synergistic effect of polysulfide and anthraquinone on kraft pulp yield improvement based on the experimental evidence. It suggested that the synergy takes place at the beginning of <b>heating-up</b> <b>period,</b> polysulfide improves AQ penetration into wood, and therefore the maximum reduction of anthraquinone is reached earlier. The accelerated delignification helps the polysulfide to better access the hemicellulose, and that leads to more efficient stabilization of carbohydrates. In the meantime AQ retards the decomposition of polysulfide, and a higher concentration of polysulfide in the cooking liquor further prevents the degradation of carbohydrates. A redox cycle similar to that of AQ was proposed for the polysulfide...|$|E
40|$|Effect of Pre{{polymerization}} on polymerization rate of propene Michael Bartke, Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg and Fraunhofer Polymer Pilot Plant Center In olefin polymerization with supported catalysts, catalyst {{activities and}} productivities are continuously improving. In terms of heat removal, {{the most critical}} stage during polymerization is directly after injection of the catalyst to the reactor: the active sites of the catalyst are concentrated on a relative small catalyst particle with only limited heat removal area to the continuous phase. Many authors have observed or predicted severe particle overheating up to polymer melting. One established mean to overcome this particle overheating challenge {{is to use a}} prepolymerization step prior to main polymerization. By applying mild conditions, the polymerization rate during prepolymerization is reduced in such a way, that particle overheating is avoided. Due to particle growth, heat transfer area is generated, which improves heat removal conditions in the subsequent main polymerization step significantly. In addition, catalyst fragmentation occurs in a more controlled manner and typically improved particle morphology is obtained. Prepolymerization is used commercially in a number or processes and is described in many patents and publications[1, 2, 3], mostly focusing on morphology development. Also increased productivities due to prepolymerization have been reported, but not many quantitative modelling studies to account for the role of prepolymerization on reaction rate are known in open literature. In lab-scale, prepolymerization is experimentally mostly studied as an in-situ prepolymerization: the reaction is started at mild conditions and then the reactor is heated up to main polymerization temperature. The <b>heating-up</b> <b>period</b> typically takes 10 to 15 minutes, during which the conditions do change. Hence, in-situ prepolymerization is a bit undefined. Another approach is to carry out prepolymerization as an external prepolymerization in a separate reactor under constant conditions and then to inject the prepolymerized catalyst to main polymerization under reaction conditions. This approach allows more defined and controlled prepolymerization and main polymerization conditions. However possible effects of storage-times of the prepolymerized catalyst have to be considered. In the presentation, experimental results for the impact of prepolymerization on reaction rate in both bulk- and gas-phase polymerization of propene for different Ziegler-Natta and also a supported metallocene catalyst applying both in-situ and external prepolymerization methods will be presented and discussed. In addition, a simplified modelling approach to account for the impact of prepolymerization on polymerization rate will be presented. The model is based on calculation the actual polymer particle temperature during course of the polymerization under consideration of a highly temperature dependent deactivation reaction...|$|E
40|$|Icing on {{leading edge}} {{surfaces}} such as wings and propeller blades presents a major risk for UAVs {{operating in a}} cold and humid environment. Reducing or loss of manoeuvrability, loss of lift, increase in drag, reducing performance through increased weight and in worst case crashing, are phenomena that can occur in case of ice formation on a UAV surface. The use of UAVs has increased significantly the last years through surveillance and reconnaissance operations and {{they are able to}} perform operations where danger to people is present. Therefore, an appropriate and efficient method for protecting the UAVs against icing conditions is desirable. The objectives of the project were to use simulations and laboratory experiments to investigate the efficiency and design of such a system where electric heating is supplied to exposed leading edges of a UAV wing surfaces through a conductive coating material. Lightweight, easy-to-apply and robust equipment due to weight restrictions of UAVs and harsh weather conditions respectively should be emphasized during the design phase of the project. In this thesis, an experimental setup of a compact and independent anti-icing system to be installed on a UAV has been wired up and tested in a laboratory and in freezing conditions. The experimental setup consisted of an Arduino microcontroller capable of controlling the power delivered to the conductive coating through feedback from thermocouples and a humidity sensor, sensing the surface temperature of the UAV wing and humidity of the surroundings respectively. It was during the experiments discovered that the PI-controllers implemented for the two heating zones were able to adjust relative to the surroundings, and keep a steady reference surface temperature of the UAV's leading edge surface during icing conditions. However, with the speed of a UAV entering icing conditions in e. g. a cloud in mind, the <b>heating-up</b> <b>period</b> of the entire leading edge surface takes too long with the available battery capacity to prevent supercooled water droplets freezing on impact. Nevertheless, with the results presented, a proof of concept by using conductive coating for anti-icing UAV leading edges has been achieved. Through lab experiment results, with small patches made with Carbo E-Therm electrically conductive coating, the coating shows great potential with rapid temperature increase, uniform heat distribution, and resistance against external influences such as water, ice and rough treatment. Thermal images revealed that this material has the necessary properties needed to prevent ice formation on UAV leading edges. Through simulations in LEWICE and COMSOL, the ice accretion process has been investigated together with how ice accretion on an airfoil's leading edge affects UAVs' manoeuvrability. Continuation of this thesis should involve ice tunnel testing to examine icing effects and how the conductive coating performs with realistic icing conditions. It would be desirable to divide the wing into more and smaller heating zones with separate temperature sensors, resulting in a rapidly surface temperature rise. Finally, the system developed in this thesis should be integrated onto a UAV and evaluated through flight tests. </p...|$|E
