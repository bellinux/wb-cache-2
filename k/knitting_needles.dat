50|$|Broomstick lace, {{also known}} as jiffy lace and peacock eye crochet, is a {{historic}} crochet technique from the 19th century which is done using a crochet hook and another long slender item such as a <b>knitting</b> <b>needle.</b> Traditionally a broomstick was used, hence the name, but the modern variant is a lightweight plastic <b>knitting</b> <b>needle</b> or smooth wooden craft dowel. A larger <b>knitting</b> <b>needle</b> or dowel {{will result in a}} lacier effect, while a smaller will provide a more closely woven effect. Because the fabric created is soft yet stable, it is well-suited for clothing and blankets.|$|R

50|$|Knitting, Looping, and {{crocheting}} involve interlacing {{loops of}} yarn, which are formed either on a <b>knitting</b> <b>needle,</b> needle, or on a crochet hook, {{together in a}} line. The processes are different in that knitting has several active loops at one time, on the <b>knitting</b> <b>needle</b> waiting to interlock with another loop, while Looping and crocheting never {{have more than one}} active loop on the <b>needle.</b> <b>Knitting</b> can be performed by machine, but crochet can only be performed by hand.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to common {{wood and metal}} needles, antique <b>knitting</b> <b>needles</b> were sometimes made from tortoiseshell, ivory and walrus tusks; these materials are now banned due to their impact on endangered species, and needles made from them are virtually impossible to find.|$|E
2500|$|Mega <b>knitting</b> <b>needles</b> are {{generally}} considered to be any <b>knitting</b> <b>needles</b> larger than size 17 (half inch diameter). Mega needles {{may or may not have}} hooks carved in the ends. [...] Hooks on large diameter needles help enormously to control the stitches whilst knitting.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second type}} of <b>knitting</b> <b>needles</b> are straight, double-pointed <b>knitting</b> <b>needles</b> (also called [...] "DPNs"). Double-pointed needles are tapered at both ends, which allows them to be knit from either end. [...] DPNs are {{typically}} used for circular knitting, especially smaller tube-shaped pieces such as sleeves, collars, and socks; usually one needle is active while the others hold the remaining active stitches. [...] DPNs are somewhat shorter (typically 7 inches) and are usually sold in sets of four or five.|$|E

2500|$|The size of {{a needle}} is {{described}} first by its diameter and secondly by its length. [...] The size of the new stitch is determined {{in large part by}} the diameter of the knitting needle used to form it, because that affects the length of the yarn-loop drawn through the previous stitch. [...] Thus, large stitches can be made with large needles, whereas fine knitting requires fine needles. In most cases, the <b>knitting</b> <b>needles</b> being used in hand-knitting are of the same diameter; however, in uneven <b>knitting,</b> <b>needles</b> of different sizes may be used. Larger stitches may also be made by wrapping the yarn more than once around the needles with every stitch. The length of a needle determines how many stitches it can hold at once; for example, very large projects such as a shawl with hundreds of stitches might require a longer needle than a small project such as a scarf or bootie. [...] Various sizing systems for needles are in common use.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are three}} basic types of <b>knitting</b> <b>needles</b> (also called [...] "knitting pins"). [...] The {{first and most}} common type {{consists}} of two slender, straight sticks tapered to a point at one end, and with a knob {{at the other end}} to prevent stitches from slipping off. Such needles are usually [...] long but, due to the compressibility of knitted fabrics, may be used to knit pieces significantly wider. [...] The most important property of needles is their diameter, which ranges from below 2 to 25mm (roughly 1inch). The diameter affects the size of stitches, which affects the gauge/tension of the knitting and the elasticity of the fabric. [...] Thus, a simple way to change gauge/tension is to use different needles, which is the basis of uneven knitting. [...] Although the diameter of the knitting needle is often measured in millimeters, there are several measurement systems, particularly those specific to the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan; a conversion table is given at knitting needle. [...] Such <b>knitting</b> <b>needles</b> may be made out of any materials, but the most common materials are metals, wood, bamboo, and plastic. [...] Different materials have different frictions and grip the yarn differently; slick needles such as metallic needles are useful for swift knitting, whereas rougher needles such as bamboo offer more friction and are therefore less prone to dropping stitches. [...] The knitting of new stitches occurs only at the tapered ends. [...] Needles with lighted tips have been sold to allow knitters to knit in the dark.|$|E
2500|$|In {{very simple}} cases, {{knitting}} {{can be done}} without tools, using only the fingers to do these tasks; however, knitting is usually carried out using tools such as <b>knitting</b> <b>needles,</b> knitting machines or rigid frames. [...] Depending on their size and shape, the rigid frames are called stocking frames, knitting boards, knitting rings (also called knitting looms) or knitting spools (also known as knitting knobbies, knitting nancies, or corkers). [...] There is also a technique called knooking of knitting with a crochet hook that has a cord attached to the end, to hold the stitches while they're being worked. Other tools are used to prepare yarn for knitting, to measure and design knitted garments, or to make knitting easier or more comfortable.|$|E

50|$|This {{knitting}} {{style is}} often easier to learn {{for people with}} crocheting experience, since the way the yarn is held in the left hand is similar to crochet, and {{the motion of the}} right hand is similar to the motion seen in crochet, although the <b>knitting</b> <b>needle</b> is held under the palm of the hand. One major difference in the motion of the right wrist is that in crochet the crochet hook may be held more like a pencil; this method of holding the <b>knitting</b> <b>needle</b> like a pencil was briefly made popular around 1900 under the guise of being more ladylike. Nowadays, however, the majority of knitters hold both needles under the palm.|$|R
2500|$|The {{thickness}} or {{weight of}} the yarn is {{a significant factor in}} determining the gauge/tension, i.e., how many stitches and rows are required to cover a given area for a given stitch pattern. [...] Thicker yarns generally require thicker <b>knitting</b> <b>needles,</b> whereas thinner yarns may be knit with thick or thin needles. [...] Hence, thicker yarns generally require fewer stitches, and therefore less time, to knit up a given garment. [...] Patterns and motifs are coarser with thicker yarns; thicker yarns produce bold visual effects, whereas thinner yarns are best for refined patterns. [...] Yarns are grouped by thickness into six categories: superfine, fine, light, medium, bulky and superbulky; quantitatively, thickness is measured by the number of wraps per inch (WPI). [...] In the British Commonwealth (outside North America) yarns are measured as 1ply, 2ply, 3ply, 4ply, 5ply, 8ply (or double knit),10ply and 12ply (triple knit). The related weight per unit length [...] is usually measured in tex or denier.|$|E
2500|$|Fundamentally, {{women were}} thought to be taking work defined as [...] "men's work;" [...] however, the work women did was {{typically}} catered to specific skill sets management thought women could handle. Management would also advertise women's work as an extension of domesticity. For example, in a Sperry Corporation recruitment pamphlet the company stated, [...] "Note the similarity between squeezing orange juice and the operation of a small drill press." [...] A Ford Motor Company at Willow Run bomber plant publication proclaimed, [...] "The ladies have shown they can operate drill presses as well as egg beaters." [...] One manager was even stated saying, [...] "Why should men, who from childhood on never so much as sewed on buttons be expected to handle delicate instruments better than women who have plied embroidery needles, <b>knitting</b> <b>needles</b> and darning needs all their lives?" [...] In these instances, women were thought of and hired to do jobs management thought they could perform based on sex-typing.|$|E
2500|$|It was the {{development}} of the knitting machine that introduced hooked needles and enabled faultless, automated knitting. Most knitters probably aren’t even aware of the many processes that their fingers perform in the making of a single stitch. [...] However, large gauge needles emphasize those actions and knitting becomes increasingly more awkward when the needle diameter is greater than the width of the knitter's finger. [...] On a one-inch diameter (size 50) needle for instance, the shaft begins to taper one and three quarter inches from the tip. This means that the stitches are spread much further apart on mega <b>knitting</b> <b>needles,</b> making them more difficult to control. [...] The hook catches the loop of yarn as each stitch is knitted, meaning that wrists and fingers don’t have to work so hard and there is less chance of stitches slipping off the needle. The position of the hook is most important. [...] Turn the left (non-working) hook to face away at all times; turn the right (working) hook toward you up whilst knitting (plain stitch) and away whilst purling.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work: the {{increase}} of capacity and operational reliability of the knitted machines by {{the improvement of the}} anti-impact properties of its needles, creation of the automated methods of the impact-wave processes analysis in the <b>knitted</b> <b>needles</b> and other objects of the rod type. For the first time, developed have been the methods, the mathematical model and program system for the automated design of the <b>knitted</b> <b>needles</b> stability. First, the influence on the spreading of the impact waves in the needle of its form constructive elements has been examined. The automated system of analysis of the impact load of the needles, rendering the valid results and considering its constructive peculiarities, which allows to essentially reduce the time for its anti-impact trial in the needles design, has been offered. The structural analysis of the <b>knitted</b> <b>needles</b> and the parametric synthesis of its constructive elements for providing the improved anti-impact properties of the needles have been performed. The program system has undergone the expertise.
