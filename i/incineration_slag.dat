In order to assess this influence of the generally necessary diminuation of the particle size of the materials and the effect of upward flow of the leachant at the standard leaching test, the SLT results of municipal waste <b>incineration</b> <b>slag</b> and phosphor slag were compared with the results of lysimeter leaching tests on the same un-ground materials in upward flow and downward flow. The results show a good agreement between both types of experiments...|$|E

With the process of industrial-scale installation (with capacity of 600 t/d) for dying sludge treatment being in operation, the stability and reliability with high degree of automation {{in the long run}} time were observed. The spray drying tower, which was designed to dry the wet sludge by directly contacting with the high temperature gas, was specially monitored and found that it can keep running with high security, without dust explosion and harmful volatile organic gases released risks. The exhaust and smoke were also determined and results indicated that the pollutants were well-controlled to meet the related national standard (GB 18485 - 2001) including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and hydrogen chloride as well as mercury and lead. Much attention should be paid to the dioxin that the emission concentration was even lower than that of the European Union Criteria. The most important for this technology {{is that there is no}} fly ash emitted. This is the distinguished difference from other incineration processes. Leaching test regarding <b>incineration</b> <b>slag</b> did not show as much pollution of heavy metal. All of the above showed that this technology had not much effect on environment and proved it successful application in China...|$|E

40|$|Municipal {{solid waste}} {{incineration}} plants produce considerable amounts of residues; the most part of them consists of <b>incineration</b> <b>slags,</b> {{which could be used}} as a construction, draining and stabilizing material in view of landfilling. Laboratory tests were carried out in order to investigate the geotechnical behaviour of four slags, coming from different italian incineration plats. In particular hydraulic and mechanical properties of the slags were evaluated by means of falling-head permeability and multistage consolidated-drained triaxial tests. Testing specimens were reconstructed in laboratory, compacting them with medium and low compaction energies...|$|R
40|$|Besides {{producing}} {{a substantial portion}} of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions, the industrial sector also generates significant quantities of solid residues. Mineral carbonation of alkaline wastes enables the combination of these two by-products, increasing the sustainability of industrial activities. On top of sequestering CO 2 in geochemically stable form, mineral carbonation of waste materials also brings benefits such as stabilization of leaching, basicity and structural integrity, enabling further valorization of the residues, either via reduced waste treatment or landfilling costs, or via the production of marketable products. This paper reviews the current state-of-the-art of this technology and the latest developments in this field. Focus is given to the beneficial effects of mineral carbonation when applied to metallurgical <b>slags,</b> <b>incineration</b> ashes, mining tailings, asbestos containing materials, red mud, and oil shale processing residues. Efforts to intensify the carbonation reaction rate and improve the mineral conversion via process intensification routes, such as the application of ultrasound, hot-stage processing and integrated reactor technologies, are described. Valorization opportunities closest to making the transition from laboratory research to commercial reality, particularly in the form of shaped construction materials and precipitated calcium carbonate, are highlighted. Lastly, the context of mineral carbonation among the range of CCS options is discussed. status: publishe...|$|R
