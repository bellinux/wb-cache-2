2500|$|Conservative writer Rich Lowry {{said that}} assault weapon is a [...] "manufactured term." [...] Joseph P. Tartaro of the Second Amendment Foundation (SAF) wrote in 1994: [...] "One {{of the key}} {{elements}} of the anti-gun strategy to gull the public into supporting bans on the so-called 'assault weapons' is to foster confusion. As stated previously, the public does not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> full automatic and a semi-automatic firearm." [...] Robert Crook, {{executive director of the}} Coalition of Connecticut Sportsmen, said [...] "the term 'assault weapon,' as used by the media, is a media invention." ...|$|E

2500|$|The U.S. Weather Bureau {{investigated}} {{the large number}} of deaths. Although Radar stations were few and far between in 1965, the severe nature of this storm was identified with adequate time to disseminate warnings. But the warning system failed as the public never received them. Additionally, the public did not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> Forecast and an Alert. [...] Thus the Tornado watch and Tornado warning programs were implemented. [...] Pivotal to those clarifications was a meeting in the WMT-TV studio in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. [...] Officials of the severe storms forecast center in Kansas City met with WMT meteorologist Conrad Johnson and News Director Grant Price. [...] Their discussion led to establishment of the official [...] "watch" [...] and [...] "warning" [...] procedures in use since 1965.|$|E

60|$|RAINA (in {{uncontrollable}} vexation). I quite {{agree with}} your account of yourself. You are a romantic idiot. (Bluntschli is unspeakably taken aback.)

60|$|RIDGEON. Oh, very likely. But {{he really}} ought to <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> vaccine and an anti-toxin. Stimulate the phagocytes! The vaccine doesnt affect the phagocytes at all. He's all wrong: hopelessly, dangerously wrong. To put a tube of serum into his hands is murder: simple murder.|$|E

6000|$|...
