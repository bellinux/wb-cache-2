5|$|Many {{facets of}} the {{interaction}} between sea otters and the human economy are not as immediately felt. Sea otters have been credited with contributing to the kelp harvesting industry via their well-known role <b>in</b> <b>controlling</b> sea urchin populations; kelp is used in the production of diverse food and pharmaceutical products. Although human divers harvest red sea urchins both for food and to protect the kelp, sea otters hunt more sea urchin species and are more consistently effective <b>in</b> <b>controlling</b> these populations. The health of the kelp forest ecosystem is significant in nurturing populations of fish, including commercially important fish species. In some areas, sea otters are popular tourist attractions, bringing visitors to local hotels, restaurants, and sea otter-watching expeditions.|$|E

However, the Aetolian League proved to be a perennial problem for Antigonus II's ambitions <b>in</b> <b>controlling</b> central Greece, while the formation of the Achaean League in 251 BC pushed Macedonian forces out of much of the Peloponnese and at times incorporated Athens and Sparta. While the Seleucid Empire aligned with Antigonid Macedonia during the Syrian Wars against Ptolemaic Egypt, the latter used its powerful navy to disrupt Antigonus II's efforts <b>in</b> <b>controlling</b> mainland Greece. With the aid of the Ptolemaic navy, the Athenian statesman Chremonides led a revolt against Macedonian authority known as the Chremonidean War (267–261 BC). However, by 265 BC, Athens was surrounded and besieged by Antigonus II's forces, a Ptolemaic fleet was defeated in the Battle of Cos, and Athens finally surrenderd in 261 BC.

5|$|After {{the virus}} enters the body {{there is a}} period of rapid viral replication, leading to an {{abundance}} of virus in the peripheral blood. During primary infection, the level of HIV may reach several million virus particles per milliliter of blood. This response is accompanied by a marked drop in the number of circulating CD4+ T cells. The acute viremia is almost invariably associated with activation of CD8+ T cells, which kill HIV-infected cells, and subsequently with antibody production, or seroconversion. The CD8+ T cell response is thought to be important <b>in</b> <b>controlling</b> virus levels, which peak and then decline, as the CD4+ T cell counts recover. A good CD8+ T cell response has been linked to slower disease progression and a better prognosis, though it does not eliminate the virus.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of diabetes on regulatory mechanisms and specific receptors {{implicated in the}} response of isolated rabbit renal artery to endothelin- 1 was examined. Endothelin- 1 induced a concentration-dependent contraction that was less potent in arteries from diabetic rabbits than <b>in</b> arteries from <b>control</b> rabbits. Endothelium removal or NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG) enhanced contractions to endothelin- 1 either <b>in</b> <b>control</b> and diabetic arteries. Indomethacin inhibited endothelin- 1 -induced response <b>in</b> <b>control</b> arteries, but enhanced it in diabetic arteries. In contrast to that observed in rubbed and in L-NOARG treated arteries, {{in the presence of}} indomethacin the contractile action of endothelin- 1 was higher in diabetic arteries than <b>in</b> <b>control</b> arteries. Nimesulide enhanced endothelin- 1 contractions both <b>in</b> <b>control</b> and diabetic arteries. Cyclo-(D-Asp-Pro-DVal-Leu-D-Trp) (BQ- 123, endothelin ETA receptor antagonist), attenuated endothelin- 1 vasoconstriction <b>in</b> <b>control</b> rabbits, while vasoconstriction resulted increased in diabetic rabbits. 2, 6 -Dimethylpiperidinecarbonyl-γ-Methyl-Leu-Nin-(Methoxycarbonyl) -D-Trp-D-Nle (BQ- 788, endothelin ETB receptor antagonist), enhanced the contractile response <b>in</b> <b>control</b> rabbit arteries without modifying this response in diabetic rabbits. In summary, diabetes decreases the sensitivity of the rabbit renal artery to endothelin- 1 by decreasing the ratio between vasoconstrictor and vasodilator prostanoids released after activation of endothelin ETA receptors...|$|R

5|$|In Nicotiana attenuata HypSys {{is known}} to not be {{involved}} in defence against insect herbivores. Silencing and over-expression of HypSys {{does not affect the}} feeding performance of larvae compared to normal plants. Berger silenced HypSys and found that it caused changes in flower morphology which reduced the efficiency of self-pollination. The flowers had pistils that protruded beyond their anthers, a similar phenotype to CORONATINE-INSENSITIVE1-silenced plants which lack a jasmonate receptor. Measurement of jasmonate levels in the flowers revealed that they were lower than in normal plants. The authors suggested that HypSys peptides in N. attenuata have diversified from their function as defence related peptides to being involved <b>in</b> <b>controlling</b> flower morphology. The signalling processes remain similar however, being mediated through jasmonates.|$|E

5|$|In animals, poly(A) {{ribonuclease}} (PARN) {{can bind to}} the 5' cap {{and remove}} nucleotides from the poly(A) tail. The level {{of access to the}} 5' cap and poly(A) tail is important <b>in</b> <b>controlling</b> how soon the mRNA is degraded. PARN deadenylates less if the RNA is bound by the initiation factors 4E (at the 5' cap) and 4G (at the poly(A) tail), which is why translation reduces deadenylation. The rate of deadenylation may also be regulated by RNA-binding proteins. Once the poly(A) tail is removed, the decapping complex removes the 5' cap, leading to a degradation of the RNA. Several other enzymes that seem to be involved in deadenylation have been identified in yeast.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that trabecular meshwork endothelial cells (TMEs) regulate aqueous outflow by actively releasing ligands that upon binding to Schlemm’s canal endothelial cells (SCEs) increase transendothelial flow, thereby facilitating the egress of aqueous. Methods: We tested our hypothesis by (1) activating the TMEs in vitro using a laser procedure known to increase aqueous outflow in vivo; (2) demonstrating that lasered TMEs become activated at the genome-wide level and synthesize ligands; (3) ascertaining that media conditioned by laser-activated TMEs and ligands therein increase transendothelial flow when added to SCEs; and (4) determining that ligands identified as synthesized by TMEs increase permeability when added to SCEs. Results: We find that adding either media conditioned by lasered TMEs or ligands synthesized by TMEs to naïve control SCEs increases permeability. Adding media boiled, diluted, or conditioned by nonlasered TMEs abrogates these permeability effects. Media conditioned by either lasered TMEs or SCEs (TME-cm/SCE-cm), when added to untreated controls of each cell type, induce congruous gene expression and flow effects: TME-cm induces far more differentially expressed genes (829 <b>in</b> <b>control</b> TMEs and 1, 120 <b>in</b> <b>control</b> SCEs) than does the SCE-cm (12 <b>in</b> <b>control</b> TMEs and 328 <b>in</b> <b>control</b> SCEs), and TME-cm also increases flow much more (more than 11 -fold <b>in</b> <b>control</b> TMEs and more than fourfold <b>in</b> <b>control</b> SCEs) than does the SCE-cm (fivefold <b>in</b> <b>control</b> TMEs and twofold <b>in</b> <b>control</b> SCEs).
