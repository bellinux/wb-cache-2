40|$|Both {{real-time}} and double-exposure phase-conjugate interferometries {{are demonstrated}} with an eosin-doped gelatin film. A xanthene dye-doped film can generate phase conjugate waves simultaneously or separately through degenerate four-wave mixing (DFWM) and holographic processes. The holographic process {{differs from the}} DFWM process in the respect that the xanthene dye-doped film can record spatial information on light like a hologram. The DFWM component has a response time of ～ msec, which is {{by a factor of}} 4 faster than that of the <b>holographic</b> <b>component.</b> The difference in their response times in the two processes is important in real-time and double-exposure phase-conjugate interferometries. Of xanthene dyes such as eosin, erythrosin and fluorescein, an eosin-doped gelatin film is most suitable for phase-conjugate interferometries...|$|E
40|$|Volume {{holographic}} {{properties of}} diarylethene doped polymers are {{reported for the}} first time. Resolution of more than 1500 lines/mm with Δn about 10 - 4 is demonstrated on a sample 1 mm thick. Angular selectivity contains two contributions – the wide one from the amplitude <b>holographic</b> <b>component,</b> and the sharp one from the phase counterpart. The half-width of the amplitude component is about order of magnitude larger {{than that of the}} phase component. High fatigue resistance of the dye allows multiple record/erase cycles without degradation. Thermal stability of the dye allows for durability of the recording material at the temperatures above 115 0 C. Holograms while stable at room temperature exhibit thermal degradation at elevated temperatures even below 115 0 C. This gives potential to implement on that material multiple use holographic thermal sensors...|$|E

The advantages and disadvantages of the use of <b>holographic</b> <b>components</b> in solar energy applications are analysed. In addition, recent experimental results from the recording and characterisation of different types of <b>holographic</b> optical <b>components,</b> such as single spherical and cylindrical lenses, multiplexed holographic gratings with high diffraction efficiency are presented.

40|$|Progress {{has been}} made in the fringe {{analysing}} procedures. At last interferometry, holography and speckle techniques are more frequently applied in industry and become a powerful tool for engineering applications. The methods will be even more frequently applied in industry, when they can be applied in real time. In speckle interferometry the speckle size can be adapted to the photoelectric detector. In nondestructive testing with holographic or speckle techniques, in addition to the automatic fringe analysis the computation of the corresponding deformation and strain needs to be further improved. Furthermore, real time storage materials, rugged and reliable lasers and <b>holographic</b> <b>components</b> are needed to make the holographic methods for nondestructive testing even more attractive for the industry...|$|R
50|$|The use of {{segmented}} phase holograms to selectively deflect {{portions of}} an image wavefront is unusual. The <b>holographic</b> optical <b>components</b> used in this device split tessellated segments of a returning wave front in programmable bulk areas and shaped patches to achieve a unique capability, increasing both {{the size of an}} object which can be read and the z-axis depth per point which is measurable, while also increasing the simultaneous operations possible, which is a significant advance in the previous state of art.|$|R
40|$|Solar {{energy is}} the most {{abundant}} source of renewable energy available. The relatively high cost prevents solar photovoltaic (PV) from replacing fossil fuel on a larger scale. In solar PV power generation the cost is reduced with more efficient PV technologies. In this dissertation, methods to improve PV conversion efficiency with <b>holographic</b> optical <b>components</b> are discussed. The tandem multiple-junction approach has achieved very high conversion efficiency. However {{it is impossible to}} manufacture tandem PV cells at a low cost due to stringent fabrication standards and limited material types that satisfy lattice compatibility. Current produced by the tandem multi-junction PV cell is limited by the lowest junction due to series connection. Spectrum-splitting is a lateral multi-junction concept that is free of lattice and current matching constraints. Each PV cell can be optimized towards full absorption of a spectral band with tailored light-trapping schemes. <b>Holographic</b> optical <b>components</b> are designed to achieve spectrum-splitting PV energy conversion. The incident solar spectrum is separated onto multiple PV cells that are matched to the corresponding spectral band. Holographic spectrum-splitting can take advantage of existing and future low-cost technologies that produces high efficiency thin-film solar cells. Spectrum-splitting optical systems are designed and analyzed with both transmission and reflection <b>holographic</b> optical <b>components.</b> Prototype holograms are fabricated and high optical efficiency is achieved. Light-trapping in PV cells increases the effective optical path-length in the semiconductor material leading to improved absorption and conversion efficiency. It has been shown that the effective optical path length can be increased by a factor of 4 n 2 using diffusive surfaces. Ultra-light-trapping can be achieved with optical filters that limit the escape angle of the diffused light. Holographic reflection gratings have been shown to act as angle-wavelength selective filters that can function as ultra-light-trapping filters. Results from an experimental reflection hologram are used to model the absorption enhancement factor for a silicon solar cell and light-trapping filter. The result shows a significant improvement in current generation for thin-film silicon solar cells under typical operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the impact of}} outdoor {{temperature}} variations and solar illumination exposure on spectral filter material and holographic optical elements is examined. Although <b>holographic</b> <b>components</b> {{have been shown to}} be useful for solar spectrum splitting designs, relatively little quantitative data exist to demonstrate the extent to which these materials can withstand outdoor conditions. As researchers seek to investigate practical spectrum splitting designs, the environmental stability of holographic materials should be considered as an important factor. In the experiment presented, two holographic materials, Covestro Bayfol HX photopolymer and dichromated gelatin, and 3 M reflective polymer filter materials are exposed to outdoor conditions for a period of several months. The environmental effect on absorption, spectral and angular bandwidth, peak efficiency, and Bragg matching conditions for the holograms are examined. Spectral bandwidth and transmittance of the 3 M reflective filter material are also monitored. Holographic gratings are recorded, measured, and mounted on glass substrates and then sealed with a glass cover plate. The test samples are then mounted on a photovoltaic panel to simulate realistic temperature conditions and placed at an outdoor test facility in Tucson, Arizona. A duplicate set of holograms and 3 M filter material is stored as a control group and periodically compared over the test period...|$|R
40|$|Electrically {{switchable}} and tunable <b>holographic</b> optical <b>components</b> {{based on}} composites of polymer-liquid crystals (H-PDLCs) are of current interest in optical communications, fiber optics, integrated optics, LC displays, for optical information processing and other electro-optical applications 1]. Typical H-PDLCs exhibit strong light-scattering {{because of the}} pres-ence of LC-droplets and high electrical switching fields. The formation procedure and the resulting properties of new type electrically switchabl/tunable diffractive devices based on photocurable monomers/liquid crystals mix-ture, named POLIPHEM (POlymer LIquid crystal Polymer Holograms Electrically Manage-able) are presented. The combination a new composite material with the holographic pattern-ing results in volume phase gratings with high diffraction efficiency, high optical quality and excellent electro-optical parameters. POLIPHEM-structures consisting of the alternating pure polymeric-walls and LC-areas of continuous strongly aligned morphology are created due to photopolymerization and phase separation of the <b>components</b> during <b>holographic</b> exposure (rec= 364 nm).

40|$|A practical, field-capable, 3. 0 to 5. 0 μm mid-wave {{infrared}} Computed-Tomography Imaging Spectrometer (CTIS) {{has been}} demonstrated. The CTIS employs a simple optical system {{in order to}} measure the object cube without any scanning. The data is not measured directly, but in a manner which requires complicated post-processing to extract an estimate of the object's spectral radiance. The advantage of a snapshot imaging spectrometer is that it can collect information about a dynamic event which a standard scanning spectrometer could either miss or corrupt with temporal artifacts. Results were presented for reconstructions of laboratory targets with sampling up to 46 x 46 x 21 voxels over a variable field-of-view, or 0. 1 μm spectral sampling. Demonstration of the snapshot capability has been performed on both static targets and targets with rapidly varying content. The contents of this dissertation are directed towards two ends. The primary undertaking is a realization of the theoretical model of the CTIS is a practical, field-capable MWIR instrument. The design, calibration, and operation of the MWIR CTIS are explained in detail in the text and appendices. Of additional interest is the advancement of the theory to improve the design and functionality of the spectrometer. A new algorithm for design of the <b>holographic</b> disperser <b>component</b> of the CTIS is introduced. The design process dramatically extends the set of possibilities for the disperser. In order to improve the reconstruction potential of the spectrometer, the analytic expressions which describe the CTIS have been expanded into a principal component basis set. The result is a technique for creating an initial estimate of the object and a technique for improving the reconstruction algorithm...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we use {{the type}} Ia supernovae data to {{constrain}} the holographic dark energy model proposed by Li. We also apply a cosmic age test to this analysis. We consider in this paper a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Universe with matter <b>component</b> and <b>holographic</b> dark energy <b>component.</b> The fit result shows that the case c< 1 (c= 0. 21) is favored, which implies that the holographic dark energy behaves as a quintom-type dark energy. Furthermore, we also perform a joint analysis of SNe+CMB+LSS to this model; the result is well improved, and still upholds the quintom dark energy conclusion. The best fit results in our analysis are c= 0. 81, Ω_m^ 0 = 0. 28, and h= 0. 65, which lead to the present equation of state of dark energy w_ 0 =- 1. 03 and the deceleration/acceleration transition redshift z_T= 0. 63. Finally, an expected SNAP simulation using ΛCDM as a fiducial model is performed on this model, and the result shows that the holographic dark energy model takes on c< 1 (c= 0. 92) even though the dark energy is indeed a cosmological constant.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{holographic}} brane-world {{model of the}} Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) scenario with and without a Gauss-Bonnet term (GB) in the bulk. We show that an <b>holographic</b> dark energy <b>component</b> with the Ricci scale as the infra-red cutoff can describe the late-time acceleration of the universe. In addition, we show that the dimensionless holographic parameter {{is very important in}} characterising the DGP branches, and in determining the behaviour of the Ricci dark energy as well as the asymptotic behaviour of the brane. On the one hand, in the DGP scenario the Ricci dark energy will exhibit a phantom-like behaviour with no big rip if the holographic parameter is strictly larger than 1 / 2. For smaller values, the brane hits a big rip or a little rip. On the other hand, we have shown that the introduction of the GB term avoids the big rip and little rip singularities on both branches but cannot avoid the appearance of a big freeze singularity for some values of the holographic parameter on the normal branch, however, these values are very unlikely because they lead to a very negative equation of state at the present and therefore we can speak in practice of singularity avoidance. At this regard, the equation of state parameter of the Ricci dark energy plays a crucial role, even more important than the GB parameter, in rejecting the parameter space where future singularities appear.

40|$|Using the {{absolute}} ages of passively evolving galaxies observed at different redshifts, one can obtain the differential ages, the derivative of redshift z {{with respect to}} the cosmic time t (i. e. d z/ dt). Thus, the Hubble parameter H(z) can be measured through the relation H(z) =-(d z/ dt) /(1 +z). By comparing the measured Hubble parameter at different redshifts with the theoretical one containing free cosmological parameters, one can constrain current cosmological models. In this paper, we use this method to present the constraint on a spatially flat Friedman-Robert-Walker Universe with a matter <b>component</b> and a <b>holographic</b> dark energy <b>component,</b> in which the parameter c plays a significant role in this dark energy model. Firstly we consider three fixed values of c= 0. 6, 1. 0 and 1. 4 in the fitting of data. If we set c free, the best fitting values are c= 0. 26, Ω_ m 0 = 0. 16, h= 0. 9998. It is shown that the holographic dark energy behaves like a quintom-type at the 1 σ level. This result is consistent with some other independent cosmological constrains, which imply that c< 1. 0 is favored. We also test the results derived from the differential ages using another independent method based on the lookback time to galaxy clusters and the age of the universe. It shows that our results are reliable. Comment: 18 pages including 7 figures and 1 tables.

40|$|The author's major {{contributions}} {{presented in}} this Ph. D. thesis are three novel design techniques (or concepts) for implementation of efficient <b>holographic</b> fiber networking <b>components.</b> The first concept is termed grating degeneration, which allows sharing of one holographic grating {{by more than one}} wave pair. This makes it possible to use a single grating as a number of 2 x 2 couplers in parallel, and the number of gratings required for fiber N x N couplers can be significantly reduced. The second concept is the so-called sandwich structure. By using a sandwich structure, a multi-stage topology, instead of a complete mesh, can be incorporated in the construction of a grating system in a coupler. This again can simplify the structure of an N x N coupler, especially when combined with the grating degeneration technique. The third technique, called quasi-Bragg diffraction is introduced in this thesis for the construction of 16 x 16 couplers. It turns out that when designed properly, the number of gratings required by a 16 x 16 coupler can be reduced to two per slab. The key technique is to use off-Bragg diffraction while keeping the violation of Bragg condition much higher for the unwanted waves than for the wanted waves. This technique may also be applied to other grating-based components. More generally, all of the three presented techniques may be applied to any multiple-grating-based component. An example is given in this thesis for applying grating degeneration to the construction of 8 x 8 wavelength routing couplers. Another aspect of the author's contribution is the development of a generalized diffraction theory. The major features of the theory are the rigorousness and the generality. On one hand, the theory is rigorously based on Maxwell's equations, which makes it a realistic model for simulations and analyses. On the other hand, the theory places no restrictions on light polarization, the incident wave direction and the parameters of the grating system. This is vital to the design of a multi-grating system using grating degeneration because of the three-dimensional arrangement of the wave vectors. Jones matrices are used for a complete characterization of any grating-bearing slabs. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
