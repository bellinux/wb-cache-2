6000|$|... 'I don't like to {{tell you}} his name, for, though 'tis night, that covers all shame-facedness, my face is as hot as a 'Talian iron, I declare! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> feel it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is {{that stuff}} you've got there!" [...] he inquired largely, seeing {{a bottle of}} somebody's Soothing Syrup by a poor woman's bedside. [...] "Take it and throw it down the sink, {{and the next time}} you want a {{soothing}} syrup put a little boot-blacking in hot water. It'll <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> as much good." ...|$|E
60|$|AUGUSTA. A bad woman couldn't have <b>done</b> what <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>just</b> now.|$|R
5000|$|I...thought to myself, 'Ian, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> ask Bradman to {{fill your}} wallet with money?' Bradman's harangue {{confirmed}} my suspicions {{that the players}} {{were going to have}} a hard time extracting more money from the ACB.|$|R
2500|$|Grossman {{sometimes}} appeared treacherously {{devoted to}} his clients' satisfaction. While wooing Joan Baez into representation, Grossman is quoted as saying, [...] "Look, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> like? <b>Just</b> tell me what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> like? I can get it for you. I can get anything <b>you</b> want. Who <b>do</b> <b>you</b> want? <b>Just</b> tell me. I'll get you anybody you want." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{you mind}} about the window," [...] said the boy, [...] "nor, to be honor bright, about the traveler's lock either, (though I ain't sorry for selling one), <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> buy one of these little jokers," [...] {{producing}} a number of suspender-like objects, which he dangled before the old man; [...] "money-belts, sir; only fifty cents." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It will do you {{no good to}} refuse," [...] {{continued}} the Princess; [...] "for I need your head for my collection, and in the Land of Ev my will is law. I never have cared much for No. 26, {{and you will find}} that it is very little worn. Besides, it will <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> as well as the one you're wearing, for all practical purposes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{do it if}} {{you want}} me too," [...] responded Walt Baxter promptly. [...] "I don't love those chaps any more than you <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> <b>just</b> fix up some {{sandwiches}} and the cake, and I'll go around and explain that Dan and Ned and Fatty, and some of the rest of us, are giving the Rovers a little spread in honor of the victory and that we don't think it any more than right that they should have some of the good things." ...|$|E
5000|$|Co-writer Natalie Hemby told The Boot {{that she}} and Lambert wanted the song to be [...] "clever." [...] She {{referred}} to the lyrics as being like [...] "a smack in the face, but you don't realize it. It's like wait ... <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> insult me?" ...|$|R
50|$|His {{story was}} {{recorded}} by journalist Luciano Scalettari, who said:” In my opinion, he is a righteous man, {{in the sense}} that the Jews attribute to this term”. Pierantonio Costa replied: ”I only answered the voice of my conscience. When there is something that has to be <b>done,</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> get on with it”.|$|R
5000|$|... 3D {{water levels}} in games, since the shows writers feel that game {{developers}} almost never capture {{the feeling of}} swimming in an enjoyable manner ("Instead of making us awkwardly pilot our character through zero-gravity space, why <b>dont</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> come to our house and punch us in the face? Its exactly {{the same amount of}} fun!") ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{leave her}} alone to choose. Don't go about looking as though you had a knife in your heart, if you find her turn {{for a moment to}} some one else. You don't want her to choose you, <b>do</b> <b>you,</b> <b>just</b> because you are a weakling, because her great kind heart can't bear the thought of making you miserable? Stand on your feet like a man and take your luck.... Can I take off my hat? I can't eat in this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't {{want any}} help, and Buff will betray me by barking; I prefer to go alone. I shall take some lunch {{and plenty of}} shot, and have a glorious time, even if I don't meet that confounded beast. I will keep dashing {{in and out of}} the woods as we go; then no one will miss me for a while, and when they <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> say, 'Oh, he's all right; he'll be along directly,' and go ahead, and let me alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bessy, {{a little}} while ago I made sure you had no romance in you," [...] replied Lane, with a smile. [...] "Now as we've gotten serious, let's think hard about the future. What do you want most? Do you care for study, for books? Have you any gift for music? Do you ever think of fitting {{yourself}} for useful work?... Or is your mind full of this jazz stuff? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> want to go from day to day, like a butterfly from flower to flower? Just this boy and that one--not caring much which--all this frivolity you hinted of, and worse, living this precious time of your youth all for excitement? What is it you want most?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{made three}} of ’em run," [...] said Miss Rumbolt, [...] "and <b>you</b> <b>did</b> nothing. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> stood still, {{and let them}} take the ship. I’m ashamed of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No--the one to you. There isn't {{another girl}} {{in the world who}} could have carried it through as <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> <b>You</b> were <b>just</b> wonderful!" ...|$|R
5000|$|ELAINE: (very dissatisfied) Why is {{everyone}} talking about [...] "The English Patient, it's so romantic"? (vehement) God, that movie stunk!BLAINE: I kinda liked it.ELAINE: (firm) No you didn't.the exit emerge several of Elaine's friends, who hurry {{over to see}} her. They're all holding tissues.CAROL: Elaine, Elaine, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> see The English Patient?GAIL: (tearful) Didn't you love it?ELAINE: No!LISA: How could you not love that movie?ELAINE: How about, it sucked? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you go and}} get engaged, or {{any such}} foolishness in a hurry, Lem. Them art-student girls you was tellin' about, I presume they're all right enough; but you wait a while. Young men think it's a kind of miracle if a girl likes 'em, and they're ready to go crazy over it; but it's {{the most natural thing}} she can <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> <b>just</b> wait a while. When you get along a little further, you can pick and choose for yourself. I don't know as I should want you should marry for money; but don't you go and take up with the first thing comes along, because you're afraid to look higher. What's become o' that nasty thing that talked so to you at that Miss Vane's?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really, {{at first}} I {{did not know}} what to think," [...] said she. [...] "Of course I {{did not know what}} had {{detained}} you in this country, but I remembered that I had heard that you were a very particular person about your flowers and shrubs and grounds, and that most likely you thought they would be better taken care of if you kept an eye on them, and that when you found there was so much to <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> went to work and did it. I did not speak of this to anybody, because if you did not wish it to be known that you were taking care of the grounds it was not my business to tell people about it. But yesterday, when I found this place where I had hung my hammock so beautifully cleared up and made so nice and clean and pleasant in every way, I thought I must come down to tell you how much obliged I am, and also that you ought not to take so much trouble for us. If you think the grounds need more attention, I will persuade my father to hire another man, now and then, to work about the place. Really, Mr. Ripley, you ought not to have to--" ...|$|E
5000|$|Norquist and {{his wife}} {{attended}} the annual Burning Man festival in August 2014 in Black Rock, Nevada. Norquist explained that he wishes to attend because, [...] "There's no government that organizes this. That's what happens when nobody tells you what to <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> <b>just</b> figure it out. So Burning Man is a refutation of {{the argument that the}} state has a place in nature." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You arouse my curiosity," [...] said I. [...] "But why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> say <b>just</b> {{now that}} there were very {{particular}} reasons why I should study this case?" ...|$|R
3000|$|... “…When you get married, you don’t leave. You don’t divorce, <b>you</b> don’t <b>do</b> anything. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> {{put up with}} it…” (3 rd {{generation}} Japanese in US; Yoshihama 2000, p. 217) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wouldn’t it <b>do</b> if <b>you</b> <b>just</b> chucked {{a bucket}} of water over me and SAID you’d pulled me out," [...] {{suggested}} the victim. [...] "The other thing seems a downright LIE." ...|$|R
5000|$|In October 2009 {{the band}} {{announced}} {{that they would be}} cancelling the last leg of the 2009 North American tour, a total of 23 shows. The band cited, [...] "unforeseen personal matters", as the reason for the cancellations. At the time, the band denied rumours about a breakup, saying, [...] "We're not splitting. Not at all. We often joke, what else would we <b>do?</b> <b>You</b> <b>just</b> can't imagine doing anything else." ...|$|E
5000|$|At {{the end of}} the {{postface}} (in the French edition), Halsman {{recalls a}} conversation with a young actress, who asked him questions about Dalí, surrealism and the meaning of the mustache, pictures of which she had seen in the English edition. Halsman had explained, that Dalí′s mustache is a symbol and relates the message, that everybody in their own way should believe to be different, unique and irreplaceable - whereupon the young woman exclaimed: [...] "A mustache with a message! How can one be so absurd?" [...] Halsman had answered her: [...] "Do you really believe that - or <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> want to flatter me?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The street {{scenes are}} a {{reminder}} of a Manchester that is long gone and are an accurate record of the mass demolition of so much of working class Victorian back-to-back dwellings. Joe Gladwin plays a waiter serving breakfast in the Manchester hotel room. [...] "I used to know your father Sir, is he still deaf?....He was unemployed for some years...We're all very proud of you. Are you still working Sir or <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> do the writing now?" [...] Bubbles smiles wryly and retorts [...] "No, I just do the writing" [...] and hands him a bank note. There is good use of little dialogue within the film, the screenplay having been written by Shelagh Delaney, and subtly amusing and poignant scenes such as this very much highlight and accurately capture the North-South divide, political and socio-economic, that is so obvious.|$|E
6000|$|But {{at last he}} said to Pelias, ‘Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> look so sad, my uncle? And what <b>did</b> <b>you</b> mean <b>just</b> {{now when}} <b>you</b> {{said that this was}} a doleful kingdom, and its ruler a miserable man?’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Miss Mohun,' {{said the}} poor girl, {{as soon as}} they were tete-a-tete, 'I know you are very good. Will you tell me what I ought to <b>do?</b> <b>You</b> saw <b>just</b> now---' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Monotonous indeed, I should imagine," [...] she agreed. [...] "You {{spend your}} time reading other people's letters, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not, <b>just</b> {{to be sure}} that there are no {{communications}} from the enemy?" ...|$|R
5000|$|More people assemble, {{including}} the Woodcutter, the Broom-maker, and his thirteen daughters. The youngest daughter tries {{to sell the}} King's Son a broom; {{he does not have}} any money, but he plays Ring-Around-the-Rosy with her. She runs away from him once the town council are all assembled. The Woodcutter, considerably embellishing the story of his trip to the Witch, announces that their king will enter the town at noon, drawn in a golden chariot. The King's Son challenges his superficial description of a king: [...] "Could you even recognize a true king, if he was not nicely dressed? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> want a puppet, a figurehead?" [...] Questioning the town's wisdom fails to make him popular. The Innkeeper's Daughter accuses him of not paying for the food she gave him, everyone starts calling him a thief, and a great melée threatens.|$|E
5000|$|... "The Moneytree" [...] is a {{film about}} one of life's most basic choices - do you work for a bank for thirty years {{to get the money}} you want, or <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> rob the bank? David, the protagonist in this action comedy, is a clandestine {{cultivator}} of the notorious Weed De Mal; in other words he grows pot for a living. His best friend tells him he's stupid; [...] "it's a small-time suckers game". His girlfriend thinks he's crazy, but David likes what he's doing and can't see the harm in it; [...] "did you ever see anyone lying in the gutter with a joint in his hand?" [...] Come to think of it, I haven't still things start to come apart when a good buddy is busted in L.A.X., while another meets something far more nasty than the police. David knows he should pull out, but some how this seems"dishonorable"; and he goes on with the play hoping to pull it off in the last few frames. We're all heroes in our own movie. [...] "The Moneytree" [...] offers a surprising look at {{the other side of the}} headlines.|$|E
5000|$|In March 2014, {{philosopher and}} secularism proponent Massimo Pigliucci asked Tyson [...] "What {{is it you}} think about God?" [...] Tyson replied [...] "I remain unconvinced by any claims anyone has ever made about the {{existence}} or {{the power of a}} divine force operating in the universe." [...] Pigliucci then asked him why he expressed discomfort with the label [...] "atheist" [...] in his Big Think video. Tyson replied by reiterating his dislike for one-word labels, saying [...] "That's what adjectives are for. What kind of atheist are you? Are you an ardent atheist? Are you a passive atheist? An apathetic atheist? Do you rally, or <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> not even care? So I'd be on the 'I really don't care' side of that, if you had to find adjectives to put in front of the word 'atheist.'" [...] Pigliucci contrasted Tyson with scientist Richard Dawkins: [...] "Dawkins really does consider, at this point, himself to be an atheist activist. You very clearly made the point that you are not." [...] Tyson replied: [...] "I completely respect that activity. He's fulfilling a really important role out there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! Mr Berners, how d'ye <b>do?</b> <b>You</b> were <b>just</b> {{the person}} I wanted to see! How is Lady Augusta, Mr Egerton? You have no idea, Mr Berners, how I have been {{fighting}} your battles!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I want," [...] I {{went on as}} I slipped new {{cartridges}} {{into the}} rifle, [...] "I want you to promise to give up drink for your daughter's sake. That's what nearly <b>did</b> for <b>you</b> <b>just</b> now, <b>you</b> know." ...|$|R
