Uppsala 2012. 372 pp. ISBN 978 - 91 - 7678 - 816 - 5. The study {{deals with}} the methods for {{elimination}} of double taxation that are applied in double tax treaties. The first aim {{of the study is}} to systematise and analyse the methods for elimination of double taxation under double tax treaties in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of how they work. A number of issues relating to the application of these methods are analysed. Since double tax treaties are applied by tax authorities, courts, and taxpayers in a domestic law context, i. e. within the framework of the legal system of a particular state, the analysis focuses on the application in Sweden of the methods for elimination of double taxation under double tax treaties. The second aim of the study is to evaluate in a few selected situations the two main methods for elimination of double taxation recommended by the OECD, namely <b>exemption</b> <b>with</b> <b>progression</b> and ordinary credit, on the basis of whether tax neutrality is achieved. For the purpose of this study, tax neutrality is deemed to be achieved when the taxation of income relating to a cross border transaction corresponds to the tax that would have been levied in either the state of residence (i. e. capital export neutrality, “CEN”) or in the other contracting state (i. e. capital import neutrality, “CIN”), had the cross border element not been present. Furthermore, for the purpose of this study, tax neutrality is deemed to be achieved if the taxation of income relating to a cross border transaction is within the range set by CEN and CIN. The evaluation shows that ordinary credit stands a greater chance than <b>exemption</b> <b>with</b> <b>progression</b> of achieving an outcome which is consistent with the goal of tax neutrality in the situations selected for study...|$|E
40|$|As of 1 January 2012, the Dutch {{corporate}} {{income tax}} (‘CIT’) system provides for international juridical double tax relief (‘DTR’) under a mechanism referred to in Dutch tax practice as the ‘base exemption for foreign business profits’ 1 (author’s translation). 2 The newly introduced DTR mechanism replaces the Dutch-style ‘tax <b>exemption</b> <b>with</b> <b>progression</b> method’ 3 {{in the area of}} corporate taxation regarding proceeds derived from foreign-source business activities. The rationale for this legislative shift, according to the Dutch tax legislator, is to arrive at an augmented level of converged tax treatment for corporate taxpayers carrying on business operations abroad either directly (i. e., through a permanent establishment; ‘PE’) or indirectly (i. e., through a subsidiary). 4 One of the introduced tax effects is that current losses suffered by resident corporate taxpayers from business activities carried on abroad through a PE are no longer taken into account for CIT calculation purposes. The tax legislator implicitly justifies its amendments by labeling the immediate horizontal cross-border loss set-off possibilities as available under the former DTR mechanism as a “cash flow advantage” granted to Dutch resident corporate taxpayers. That characterization reveals an underlying normative consideration. We do away with an ‘advantage’ to arrive at a taxing system devoid of anomalies at this point. The Dutch tax legislator suggests an improvement. But has he not in fact created a disadvantage? And, by doing that infringes upon the spirit of the internal market within the European Union (‘EU’) in the process...|$|E

As alternatives to active business tests, we consider minimum taxes that allow expensing for real investment abroad.

40|$|We {{retrospectively}} studied 463 {{patients with}} primary non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer diagnosed between 1999 and 2008 at two facilities (Kawasaki Municipal Ida Hospital and Yokohama Minami Kyosai Hospital). In this study, disease progression {{was defined as}} invasion to the muscle or further (upstage) and presence of metastasis (metastasis). We detected progression in 22 cases, including 18 upstages and 4 metastasis. Univariate analysis showed that factors associated <b>with</b> <b>progression</b> were T category (pT 1 p＜ 0. 0001), grade (high grade p＜ 0. 0001, G 3 p＜ 0. 0001) and number of tumors (multiple p＝ 0. 0213). Multivariate analysis showed that the only equivocal factor associated <b>with</b> <b>progression</b> was T category (T 1). Use of a second tansurethral resection for high-grade pT 1 cases was unrelated to progression. Among the patients <b>with</b> <b>progression,</b> many had a more advanced T category {{at the time of}} radical treatment, and the results of treatment were poor.
