Results obtained in 2005 were compared with previous findings in 2000, 1995, and 1990. Exactly the same methods and journals were used in each year. In 2005, the most-cited scholars were Robert J. Sampson in American criminology journals, American criminal justice journals, and international criminal justice journals, and David P. Farrington in international criminology journals. Overall, Robert J. Sampson was the most-cited scholar in these 20 journals in 2005. He was also the most-cited scholar in these journals in 2000, compared with Lawrence W. Sherman in 1995 and Marvin E. Wolfgang in 1990. The most-cited works of the most-cited scholars included the theories of Sampson and Laub, Gottfredson and Hirschi, and Moffitt, {{as well as the}} criminal career paradigm, the effectiveness of correctional treatment, and evidence-based crime prevention.

50|$|Gitl Schaechter-Viswanath (born 1958) is a Yiddish-language {{poet who}} was born in The Bronx, New York, USA. She grew up in a Yiddish-speaking home and {{attended}} Yiddish schools as a child. She began writing poetry, much of which was published in the journals Yugntruf and Afn Shvel, in 1980. Several poems were published in English and Yiddish in Hadassah magazine, the literary <b>journal</b> <b>Five</b> Fingers Review, and various anthologies. While her poems range widely in subject matter, her lyric technique is remarkably consistent. She tends towards short poems of no more than two pages, exploring single incidents or observations fully but using highly compressed language. She uses rhyme in many but not all poems, and varies rhyme scheme within a poem when necessary. She uses a variety of meter as well as unmetered verse. While her technique produces poems of unusual intensity, they are leavened with playfulness and puns. Her subject matter includes big questions such as marriage and grief; and small questions such as baking a failed loaf of bread. A poem about the day following the September 11, 2001 attacks is eerily still.|$|E

40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate changes in scholarly influence by identifying the most-cited scholars in twenty journals: <b>five</b> American criminology <b>journals,</b> <b>five</b> American criminal justice <b>journals,</b> <b>five</b> international criminology <b>journals,</b> and <b>five</b> international criminal justice journals. The most-cited works of the most-cited scholars were also reported. Results obtained in 2000 were compared with previous findings in 1995 and 1990, and with results obtained from analyzing nine journals in 1996 - 2000. In 2000, the most-cited scholars were Robert J. Sampson in American criminology journals, Francis T. Cullen in American criminal justice journals, John Braithwaite in international criminology journals, and Robert D. Hare in international criminal justice journals. The expansion from nine to twenty journals benefited international scholars such as John Braithwaite and Richard V. Ericson and scholars in less mainstream areas such as Murray A. Straus. Overall, Robert J. Sampson was the most-cited scholar in these twenty journals in 2000, compared with Lawrence W. Sherman in 1995 and Marvin E. Wolfgang in 1990. The prevalence of citations (the number of different articles in which a scholar was cited) and specialization (where a scholar's influence was based on one or two highly-cited works) were also studied. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{case study}} explores the {{evolution}} of the library published Journal of eScience Librarianship (JeSLIB), as it evolves to continue to serve librarians faced with the many challenges of a data driven environment. JeSLIB is an open access, peer-reviewed journal published by the Lamar Soutter Library at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. The library publishes JeSLIB through its eScholarship@UMMS repository on the bepress Digital Commons platform. JeSLIB was at the forefront of thinking about the “library as scholarly publisher” and sought to fill a need for librarians to learn about new challenges related to scientific research data. The journal provides mechanisms for authors to confidently share their work under an appropriately selected Creative Commons license. JeSLIB is also committed to spreading the scholarly work of the profession, and uses Altmetrics to track where readers are sharing articles to. Additionally, the adoption of social media platforms, including YouTube and Twitter, has allowed the journal to interact with readers and authors in new ways. The journal’s team of librarian editors has acquired new skills and expertise in all facets of scholarly publishing to the benefit of the library. Running a publishing program can serve as a critical tool to help librarians cultivate new partnerships and roles. Since starting the <b>journal</b> <b>five</b> years ago, the editorial team has reworked its scope to include newer developments within data science. In thinking about reframing the journal to remain relevant and current, the editors recently conducted an extensive review and revision of the journal’s policies as well as updating the journal’s website. Through this presentation, the editors will share their experiences supporting open access of research, rethinking scholarly publishing, and advancing scientific communication...|$|E

40|$|Dr Jane Roscoe is {{currently}} Programme Executive at SBS Television in Australia. She started {{her career as}} an academic in London with a fondness for theory. During her time at The University of Waikato in Aotearoa, she became drawn to empirical research, and in particular audience research, in combination with an ongoing interest in documentary. She published numerous journal articles and authored two books on documentary: Documentary in New Zealand: An Immigrant Nation (1999) and (with Craig Hight) Faking It: Mock-Documentary and the Subversion of Factuality (2001). She moved to Griffith University in 2000, and quickly became an influential intellectual presence {{in the field of}} Media and Cultural Studies in Australia. Her article Big Brother Australia: Performing the Real Twenty Four Seven in The International Journal of Cultural Studies is still the most cited article of that <b>journal</b> <b>five</b> years on. However, it is not only her academic work that gives her presence importance, but also her tireless commitment to move her ideas beyond the academic context. She frequently appears on both radio and television, and in 2001 she was the first media academic to appear on Big Brother Australia. In short, she is the embodiment of the public intellectual. After two years at Griffith, Jane moved out of the academy to become Head of the Centre for Screen Studies and Research at the Australian Film, Television and Radio School. She has been a programmer at SBS since 2005. Given Janes eclectic background, this interview will explore a number of main themes. Firstly, it will provide a rare insight into the decision making processes about television content and scheduling at the unique public broadcaster that is SBS. Secondly, Jane discusses her ideas and theoretical reflections on documentary as a genre and the influences of reality television. She is a passionate defender of both popular culture and innovation in television, with a particular focus on mock documentary and reality television. Related to her role as a public intellectual is the strong belief that Australia needs a television culture because only then can television be taken seriously as an art form and {{an important part of the}} public sphere. The overarching theme is the often challenging but potentially highly productive blending of theory and practice, as the title of this interview suggests. This interview was conducted in May 2006 in Brisbane. Jane was in town to deliver the annual Henry Mayer Lecture at The University of Queensland, entitled Making Great Television: When Theory Met Practice...|$|E
40|$|In 2011, at the Copenhagen Business School (CBS) in Denmark, the Department of Informatics and the Centre for Applied Information and Communication Technology (CAICT) merged to {{form the}} Department of Information Technology Management (ITM). In April 2017, this {{department}} {{changed its name to}} the Department of Digitalization (DIGI). This paper analyses the first five years’ 111 <b>journal</b> (<b>five</b> year is the departments strategic planning period). The purpose of the paper is to investigate to what extent these articles reflect the DIGI’s strategy. We compare previous expectations with present realities in the following areas: (1) articles published in leading journals, (2) organise articles around emergent themes and (3) focus on articles about information and technology. DIGI’s mission is to co-create knowledge with enduring consequences through the study of the interrelationships among people, information, and technology. DIGI’s strategy is to create a context where researchers can realize their potential in a supportive and conducive environment with a set of common values, aspirations, and directions. This can only be achieved by building a work environment founded on mutual trust and respect where the best academics can thrive. The ITM strategy, revised in 2012, outlines three areas {{that could be used to}} measure whether the department has achieved its goals or not. The first area relates to our goal “to increase the visibility and impact of our research”. Therefore, each department faculty member is responsible for publishing his/her work in journals that are the most and thereby obtain a high author h-index. The second area reflects our size and potential impact “as one of the largest information system departments in Europe”. Our goals are equally grand. The research should be organized in order to create opportunities for collaboration as well as to keep up with the fast and radical innovation typical for the IT field. One way of achieving this is to organize research around themes rather than traditional research groups. Themes are emergent, topical, popular, inter-disciplinary, and dynamic in nature. They are usually active for 3 – 7 years, after which they either transform into other themes or dissolve altogether. The third area relates to the ambition to focus on “the interaction of people, information, and technology in all of its manifestations” (ITM’s strategy. We study how individuals, groups, organizations, and society can grow and prosper by capitalizing on information technologies. IT should always play a central role in our research. We do not focus solely on technical aspects or on organizational aspects, but rather take a socio-technical perspective and a multidisciplinary approach to address a range of strategic, structural, and operational activities involved in gathering, processing, storing, distributing, and using information and its derivatives in organizations and society. Before presenting the methodology and the results of our literature review, a brief summary of the accumulated knowledge contribution found in Research@CBS.
