40|$|The article {{investigates the}} duties of <b>flag</b> <b>States</b> to {{implement}} and enforce international standards and regulations. Two related but still distinct topis are treated: General duties of <b>flag</b> <b>States</b> (applicable especially to merchant vessels) and duties concerning fishing vessels. After scrutinising the reasons for inadequate <b>flag</b> <b>State</b> implementation and enforcement, the author discusses possible counter measures of non-flag States. The article notably evaluates systems of Port State Control and possibilities of non-flag States to enforce RFMO regulations and other fishing vessel responsibilities against non-member vessels. Finally, possible consequences against the <b>flag</b> <b>State</b> itself as opposed to merely its vessels are examined {{and if it is}} permissible to non-recognise a vesselâ€™s flag in case the <b>flag</b> <b>State</b> consistently violates its duties to control its vessels...|$|R
40|$|The {{starting}} point for this analysis of <b>flag</b> <b>State</b> responsibilities is to recall {{the historical development of}} the extant regulatory regime for jurisdiction and control of ships; from the genesis of ship registration in the thirteenth century, through {{to the development of the}} nation State and concept of the <b>flag</b> <b>State,</b> on to the gradual evolution of national law for control of ships, and eventual codification of this law into international law in the twentieth century. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC) provides for a State to grant its nationality to ships, to fix the conditions for the grant of its nationality, to register ships in its territory, and for those ships to fly its flag. With these rights come <b>flag</b> <b>State</b> responsibilities. The <b>flag</b> <b>State</b> has a duty to effectively exercise its jurisdiction and control in administrative, technical, social and environmental protection matters over ships flying its <b>flag.</b> The <b>flag</b> <b>State</b> can undertake these duties or has the ability to entrust them to private organizations. A regulatory framework in international maritime law has been established that allows delegation of <b>flag</b> <b>State</b> responsibilities and recognizes the customary role of Classification Societies in inspection, survey and certification of ships. The LOSC also requires that a ship be surveyed before registration. As the <b>flag</b> <b>State</b> has the right to fix the conditions for the grant of its nationality it can choose to not require this survey for reasons of expediency and easy entry of ships onto its register. The regulatory framework for jurisdiction and control of ships provides opportunities for the establishment of regulatory inefficient <b>flag</b> <b>States</b> who have the right in law to delegate, or derogate, all of their statutory functions to equally inefficient private organizations. Such <b>flag</b> <b>States</b> are attractive to shipowners seeking minimum compliance costs and regulatory oversight. Issues of <b>flag</b> <b>State</b> responsibility and performance are analysed in depth to test the hypothesis that the extant regulatory framework is adequate in law but, due to inadequate implementation, monitoring and enforcement, does not deliver the intent of the LOSC that <b>flag</b> <b>States</b> exercise effective jurisdiction and control over ships flying their flag. For the purpose of analysis in this thesis <b>flag</b> <b>States</b> are categorized into National, Quasi-National, International and Pseudo-National according to their degree of regulatory efficiency. It is concluded that the regulatory framework is fundamentally sound but that it requires effective implementation and enforcement through strengthening in law, supported by sanctions upon recalcitrant <b>flag</b> <b>States,</b> and a greater degree of global oversight and monitoring of <b>flag</b> <b>State</b> performance by the International Maritime Organization...|$|R
5|$|International law {{requires}} that every merchant ship be registered in a country. The country in which a ship is registered is its <b>flag</b> <b>state,</b> and the <b>flag</b> <b>state</b> gives the ship the right to fly its civil ensign. A ship's <b>flag</b> <b>state</b> exercises regulatory control over the vessel and is required to inspect it regularly, certify the ship's equipment and crew, and issue safety and pollution prevention documents. A ship operates under the laws of its <b>flag</b> <b>state,</b> and these laws are used if the ship is involved in an admiralty case. The organization which actually registers the ship is known as its registry. Registries may be governmental or private agencies.|$|R

5|$|There are {{a number}} of common threads found in criticisms of the flag of {{convenience}} system. One is that these <b>flag</b> <b>states</b> have insufficient regulations and that those regulations they do have are poorly enforced. Another is that, in many cases, the <b>flag</b> <b>state</b> cannot identify a shipowner, much less hold the owner civilly or criminally responsible for a ship's actions. As a result of this lack of <b>flag</b> <b>state</b> control, <b>flags</b> of convenience are criticized on grounds of providing an environment for conducting criminal activities, supporting terrorism, providing poor working conditions for seafarers, and having an adverse effect on the environment.|$|R

As has already been noted in the report of the UN Secretary-General to be the submitted to the 63 rd session of the UN General Assembly, there are clear indications that a number of <b>flag</b> <b>States</b> regularly fail to comply with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS), and other relevant international instruments and agreements. Some <b>flag</b> <b>States</b> fail to ratify and implement vital social and environmental instruments, some <b>flag</b> <b>States</b> fail to exercise effective jurisdiction over vessels flying their flag. In addition to the risks posed to seafarers and to the marine environment, this report highlights the failure of the current regime, with its preference for anonymity over accountability, to adequately address potentially catastrophic breaches of security or safety. Open Registers or Flags of Convenience (FOCs) The use of flags of convenience and the establishment of new registers by States with no pre-existing maritime infrastructure is growing. To shipping and fishing interests, the economic attraction of registering a vessel under a flag with lower costs, more relaxed crewing requirements and less vigorous regulation is undeniable. Moreover there can be a competitive disadvantage in registering with more reputable flags. However, the wider consequences should not be underestimated. Without transparency of ownership, without the connection between the beneficial owners of a vessel and the <b>flag</b> <b>State</b> responsible for jurisdiction on board {{it is not possible to}} ensure the highest standards in maritime security and safety. For these reasons it is vital for States to address, at the appropriate level and without delay, these important issues of international governance...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve <b>flag</b> <b>State</b> {{performance}} {{in the field of}} fisheries, the involvement of classification societies is proposed. However, very few documents or literature deal with such a proposal. In other words, involvement of classification societies in global fisheries is undoubtedly only in the proposal phase yet. The reason why classification societies are not involved in fisheries seems to be a simple lack of competence of maritime administrations over fishing vessels. This characteristic makes it unlikely that international legal instruments will include provisions that could be relevant for fishing vessels in the near future. Therefore, it is considered to be wise to start with a blank sheet and develop a potential basis for classification activities in fisheries around the globe from the scratch. The gap between the examination of a single vessel and the assessment of a <b>flag</b> <b>State</b> needs to be bridged. The study addresses the role and function of classification societies in the maritime field and prospects for a parallel role and function vis-a-vis assessments of <b>flag</b> <b>states</b> upholding agreed rules of responsible <b>flag</b> <b>states</b> in fisheries...|$|R
