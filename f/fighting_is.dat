5|$|Rules of the NHL, the North American junior leagues, {{and other}} North American {{professional}} minor leagues punish fighting with a five-minute major penalty. What separates these leagues from other major North American sports leagues {{is that they}} do not eject players simply for participating in a fight. However, <b>fighting</b> <b>is</b> frequently punishable by ejection in European leagues, and in Olympic competition.|$|E
5|$|The {{two sides}} met and {{fought in the}} {{vicinity}} of the Lochty Burn, near where Carnoustie town centre now lies. The <b>fighting</b> <b>is</b> said to have been so fierce that the Lochty burn ran red with the blood of the fallen.|$|E
5|$|A male {{sea otter}} {{is most likely}} to mate if he {{maintains}} a breeding territory in an area that is also favored by females. As autumn is the peak breeding season in most areas, males typically defend their territory only from spring to autumn. During this time, males patrol the boundaries of their territories to exclude other males, although actual <b>fighting</b> <b>is</b> rare. Adult females move freely between male territories, where they outnumber adult males by an average of five to one. Males that do not have territories tend to congregate in large, male-only groups, and swim through female areas when searching for a mate.|$|E
40|$|Reflexive <b>fighting</b> <b>was</b> {{elicited}} between paired rats as {{a reflex}} reaction to electric shock prior to any specific conditioning. Such <b>fighting</b> <b>was</b> fairly stereotyped and easily differentiated from the rats' usual behavior. The {{strength of this}} reflex was not attributable to any apparent operant reinforcement. Elicitation of <b>fighting</b> <b>was</b> a direct function of the enclosed floor area and a nonmonotonic function of the shock intensity...|$|R
50|$|On 15 July 2012, fierce <b>fighting</b> <b>was</b> {{reported}} {{in some quarters}} of central Damascus as the army moved in to dislodge rebels. The rebels <b>fighting</b> <b>were</b> {{the ones who were}} crushed in Douma and other suburbs and fled to Damascus itself. Fighting also closed the road leading from central Damascus to airport.|$|R
25|$|Dog <b>fighting</b> <b>was</b> {{considered}} {{a way for}} the Samurai to retain their aggressive edge during peaceful times. Several daimyō, such as Chosokabe Motochika and Yamauchi Yodo, both from Tosa Province (present-day Kōchi Prefecture), were known to encourage dog <b>fighting.</b> Dog <b>fighting</b> <b>was</b> also popular in Akita Prefecture, which is the origin of the Akita breed.|$|R
5|$|Among {{domestic}} cats, {{males are}} more likely to fight than females. Among feral cats, the most common reason for cat <b>fighting</b> <b>is</b> competition between two males to mate with a female. In such cases, most fights are won by the heavier male. Another common reason for fighting in domestic cats is the difficulty of establishing territories within a small home. Female cats also fight over territory or to defend their kittens. Neutering will decrease or eliminate this behavior in many cases, suggesting that the behavior is linked to sex hormones.|$|E
5|$|In August 1874, Carpenter became {{involved}} in fighting at Anadarko Reservation, Wichita, Indian Territory. This <b>fighting</b> <b>is</b> considered {{the first of many}} clashes during the Red River War (1874–75). Carpenter, with Troops H & I was sent to support Fort Sill and by using aggressive patrols engaged several Kiowa and Comanche raiding parties. The relatively peaceful Wichita Indians on the reservation were targets of the hostile Indians because of their increasing positive status under pacification.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{fighting}} in ice hockey, <b>fighting</b> <b>is</b> tolerated in professional box lacrosse. Professional players are not automatically subject to ejection, but incur a five-minute major penalty. In CLA (Canadian Lacrosse Association) play, players are assessed a five-minute major penalty plus a game misconduct. Fighting in youth or club level box lacrosse is typically penalized with expulsion and suspensions. In 1990, when the Six Nations created the new Mohawk lacrosse league, fighting was specifically targeted as unacceptable. Violators were {{ejected from the}} game in which the altercation occurred and given a minimum three game suspension.|$|E

5000|$|On 16 October, further <b>fighting</b> <b>was</b> {{reported}} from Bani Walid on {{three of the}} fronts surrounding the town, as opposed to previous <b>fighting</b> which <b>was</b> confined to the Mordum area. The brigades involved in the initial <b>fighting</b> <b>were</b> from Misrata, Mizda, and Gharyan. As with previous fighting however, the <b>fighting</b> had not <b>been</b> authorised by the Yousef Mangoush, the Armed Forces Chief of Staff. Despite lacking authorisation from Libya's political and military leadership, the fighting led to an escalating series of skirmishes between both sides, with 11 dead and 94 wounded being reported early on 18 October.|$|R
5|$|The {{ring-tailed lemur}} is polygynandrous, {{although}} the dominant male in the troop typically breeds with more females than other males. <b>Fighting</b> <b>is</b> most common during the breeding season. A receptive female may initiate mating by presenting her backside, lifting her tail {{and looking at}} the desired male over her shoulder. Males may inspect the female's genitals to determine receptiveness. Females typically mate within their troop, but may seek outside males.|$|E
5|$|A soccer kick, {{also known}} as a soccer ball kick in puroresu and shoot <b>fighting,</b> <b>is</b> a {{reference}} to a kick that is similar to kicks used in association football. It is the colloquial term for a kick performed against a prone, kneeling, rising or supine opponent by a fighter who is in a standing or semi-standing position, to any part of a downed opponent. The soccer kick was used in the first match of the Ultimate Fighting Championship at UFC 1 in 1993. Gerard Gordeau defeated Teila Tuli with a soccer kick, which also knocked out one of Tuli's teeth. The technique is banned under the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts however other rulesets, including the ones used by Pride Fighting Championships do permit them. Soccer kicks have been regularly discussed as to potential damage. There has been a regular debate on the usage of them within MMA. Some MMA fans and fighters support them while a fight doctor and politicians have opposed them.|$|E
5|$|Another {{reason is}} the {{protection}} of star players. Fighting within the game can also {{send a message to}} players and coaches from other teams that cheap shots, dirty plays, and targeting specific players will not be tolerated and there will be consequences involved. Fighting can provide retribution for a team's player getting targeted or injured. Overall, <b>fighting</b> <b>is</b> known to be a beneficial policing that the game needs to keep players in line. Over the history of hockey, many enforcers have been signed simply to protect players like Gretzky, who was protected by Dave Semenko, Marty McSorley, and others, and Brett Hull, who was protected by Kelly Chase and others. Many believe that without players protecting each other, referees would affect the game play by having to call more penalties, and the league would have to suspend players for longer periods.|$|E
50|$|On 15 July, fierce <b>fighting</b> <b>was</b> {{reported}} {{in some quarters}} of central Damascus as the army moved in to dislodge rebels. The rebels <b>fighting</b> <b>were</b> {{the ones who were}} routed from Douma and other suburbs and fled to Damascus itself. Fighting also closed the road leading from central Damascus to airport.

50|$|On 25 May, {{government}} and Hezbollah forces had also reportedly breached rebel defence {{lines at the}} al-Dabaa air base from the northwest and entered the facility where <b>fighting</b> <b>was</b> ongoing, according to the Army. SOHR reported that the <b>fighting</b> <b>was</b> taking place around the base, while rebels were still maintaining control of it, though it was being heavily shelled by government forces.|$|R
25|$|Radio {{communications}} between the <b>fighting</b> units <b>were</b> {{operated by the}} Pakistan Army.

5|$|By {{the time}} Vashyron and his comrades learn the full tale from Juris, Rowen {{is in the}} midst of a crisis of faith due to his control over the Zenith System through his ring. During the party's {{confrontation}} with Sullivan where he threatens to destroy Leanne's quartz, Rowen shoots Sullivan to try and prove the existence of a higher power through Leanne's survival. The three then confront Rowen directly and fatally wound him, but Rowen's control of the Zenith System preserves his life. Vashyron calls Zephyr and Leanne off, seeing further <b>fighting</b> <b>is</b> pointless. During the game's credits, Rowen uses his power to resurrect the Cardinals, then leaves the control ring on Frieda's grave, and Sullivan is seen reuniting with Rebecca. In a post-credit scene, Leanne, Zephyr and Vashyron explore the now-clean world beyond Basel, and Leanne's quartz is revealed to have been safely embedded in her hand.|$|E
5|$|Intimidation is an {{important}} element of a hockey game and some enforcers start fights just to intimidate opposing players in hopes that they will refrain from agitating skilled players. For example, in the late 1950s, Gordie Howe helped establish himself as an enforcer by defeating Lou Fontinato, a notable tough guy who tallied over 1,200 penalty minutes in his career. Fontinato suffered a broken nose from the fight. After that incident, Howe got a lot more space on the ice and was able to score many goals over the span of his career because he intimidated other players. Conversely, games in European professional leagues are known to be less violent than North American games because <b>fighting</b> <b>is</b> discouraged in Europe by ejection and heavy fines. Since the penalties for fighting are so severe, the enforcers are less able to intimidate opposing players with fighting and said players take more liberties on the ice.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the many}} reasons for fighting, the {{foremost}} is retaliation. When players engage in play {{that members of the}} opposing team consider unscrupulous, a fight can ensue. The fight may be between the assailant and the victim, between the assailant and an enforcer from the victim's team, or between opposing enforcers. Fights that occur for retaliation purposes can be in immediate response to an on-ice incident, to incidents from earlier in the game, or to actions from past games. Enforcers who intend to start a fight have to consider their timing due to the Instigator rule. For example, putting the opposing team on a power play due to penalties incurred from <b>fighting</b> <b>is</b> less advisable when the game is close.|$|E

5|$|Although {{they all}} share the forest, {{relationships}} between different Clans are tense. They often come {{into conflict with}} one another, becoming aggressive if a cat from a neighboring Clan accidentally crosses a border. This rivalry can increase in times of deprivation, such as if one Clan is suffering from a shortage of prey but another is thriving. An attempt for one Clan to steal all of or part of another Clan's territory is not unusual. To prepare for this, cats in all Clans are taught battle moves {{in order to protect}} their territory. Each Clan has signature battle moves that are taught to them from an early age (6 months/moons old). Border fights are the most common source of battle (a cat intentionally or unwittingly steps into another Clan's territory), and are often short-lived and cause no real damage to either side. However, bigger and more brutal battles can occur; at this point, casualties are to be expected. Despite this rivalry, the Clans can also show concern for another's well being; the idea of one Clan being destroyed causes deep distress, and will prompt urgent action on behalf of all four Clans. On the night of every full moon, the Clans will meet at a designated spot in order to share stories and news in peace. This is known as a 'Gathering', and is the only time in which <b>fighting</b> <b>is</b> prohibited.|$|E
5|$|Despite Autumn Games' {{support and}} desire to expand Skullgirls, their {{continued}} litigation prevented the publisher from providing any financial backing. Attempting {{to pick up where}} they left off, Lab Zero Games decided to ask its fanbase for help once more, following the success of the EVO 2013 charity drive. On February 25, 2013, Lab Zero Games set up an Indiegogo page for Skullgirls, in an effort to raise $150,000 {{for the development of the}} game's first DLC character, Squigly. Contributors received various rewards, including desktop wallpapers, a digital copy of the official soundtrack, Steam keys for the PC release, Steam keys for Half-Minute Hero, and the chance to add a background character to the game, among others. The campaign reached its initial goal in less than 24 hours, while the stretch goal of a second DLC character, Big Band, secured funding in just over 2 weeks. A third DLC character, determined by fan vote, was funded during the final two days, along with a playable robotic version of Ms. Fortune named Robo-Fortune. An additional stretch goal that would provide a free license for the game's engine, Z-Engine, to the developers of Them's Fightin' Herds (at the time called <b>Fighting</b> <b>is</b> Magic) was also funded. With minutes left before the end of the drive, the last stretch goal was met, securing funding for another fan-selected DLC character. The Indiegogo campaign raised nearly $830,000 of its original $150,000 goal. Several alternate character and announcer voice packs were also funded. All downloadable characters and voice packs were free to download on all platforms within the first three months of their release.|$|E
