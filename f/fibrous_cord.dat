30|$|Vitelline or omphalomesenteric duct {{remnants}} {{are rare}} congenital anomalies {{associated with the}} primitive yolk stalk. The vitelline duct is an embryologic communication between the primary yolk sac and the embryonic midgut, which gradually narrows and finally closes by week of 9 gestation [1 – 8]. Incomplete closure of the vitelline duct on the antimesenteric side can persist as a variety of anomalies. Meckel’s diverticulum is the most common, but others include vitelline duct fistula, sinus tract, cysts, and <b>fibrous</b> <b>cords</b> from the intestine to the umbilicus [7, 8]. Vitelline arteries originate from the primitive dorsal aorta and travel with the vitelline duct, and its remnant persists as fibrous bands covered by peritoneum. Rutherford et al. [3] {{have found that the}} vitelline vascular remnant coursed along the side of mesentery and insert into Meckel’s diverticulum or the posterior wall at the umbilicus. Furthermore, a vitelline vascular remnant sometimes occurs without Meckel’s diverticulum [9]. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with vitelline vascular remnant.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Dupuytren’s Disease (DD) is a fibroproliferative {{disease of}} the normal palmar and digital fascia of the hand, {{resulting}} {{in the formation of}} <b>fibrous</b> <b>cords.</b> Although this is a benign disease, the <b>fibrous</b> <b>cords</b> can give rise to disabling flexion deformities of the fingers, sometimes necessitating amputation in the advanced stages. Although the normal microanatomy of the fascial structures of the hand is essential to the understanding of DD’s progression and its treatment, the literature in unequivocal especially where it concerns the transition of the palmar fascia into the digital fascia. The aim of this study was therefore to elucidate the microanatomy of the palmodigital junction and its relation to palmar and digital fascial structures. Methods: To this end we performed a literature and a dissection study. We dissected a total number of 26 cadaveric digits, 13 middle fingers and 13 ring fingers from 13 fresh frozen human cadaveric hands. A longitudinal midline incision was used on the volar aspect of the hand, running from the midpalm to the tip of the finger. The characteristics of the palmodigital structures were observed and their interrelations with palmar and digtal structures. The proximal and distal borders of the palmodigital fibrous condensations were measured and their width in the midline of the finger at origin and radially and ulnarly. Results: At the palmodigital junction we found a structure which to our knowledge has not been described before. This structure spirals around the neurovascular bundle at the palmodigital junction and we therefore suggest to call it the palmodigital spiralling sheet (PSS). The proximal border fibres of PSS originate from the pretendinous band and insert into the natatory ligament (NL). The intermediate fibres originate from the flexor tendon sheath over the A 1 pulley and continue as Grayson’s fibres. The distal border fibres originate from the flexor tendon sheath just distal to the proximal border of the A 2 pulley and arch into Cleland’s 1 B ligament while it attaches on the flexor tendon sheath at the proximal interphalangeal joint. PSS forms the most proximal and inner part of the neurovascular tunnel. Additionally three types of continuities between volar and dorsal fibres in the digit have been found, possibly contributing to a spiralling arrangement of fibres in the neurovascular tunnel. Conclusion: This study has provided new insights in the microanatomy of the palmar, digital and especially the palmodigital fascia of the hand. The palmodigital spiralling sheet at the palmodigital junction has been found to have an important linking function between the palmar and the digital fascia. PSS and the continuities found between fibres in the digit make the fascia of the palm and digit an intertwining continuum of fibres, instead of separate anatomical structures. Therefore any part of this continuum has the potential of becoming pathologic in DD. ...|$|R
40|$|Dermatan sulfate (DS) {{widespread}} as {{a component}} of extracellular matrix proteoglycans, is characterized by great bio-reactivity and remarkable structural heterogeneity due to distinct degrees of sulfation and glucuronosyl epimerization and different polymerization degrees. However, DS metabolism under various biological conditions is poorly known. Dupuytren’s contracture is a benign fibromatosis leading to complex remodeling of the palmar fascia structure and properties. However, it remains unclear whether the disease affects the structure of DS, which is the major tissue glycosaminoglycan. Thus the aim {{of the study was to}} examine the structure of the total DS in Dupuytren’s fascia. DS chains were extracted from 5 samples of normal fascia and 7 specimens of Dupuytren’s tissue by papain digestion followed by fractionation with cetylpyridinium chloride. Then, DS structure analysis was performed comprising the evaluation of its molecular masses and sensitivity to hyaluronidase and chondroitinase B. Dupuytren’s contracture is associated with significant remodeling of DS chain structure revealed by (1) a distinct profile of chain molecular masses characterized by the appearance of long size components as well as the increase in the content of small size chains; (2) a different glucuronosyl epimerization pattern connected with the enhanced content of glucuronate disaccharide blocks; (3) chain oversulfation. These structural alterations in total DS may modify the GAG interactions especially affecting collagen fibrillogenesis and growth factor availability. Thus, Dupuytren’s contracture associated DS remodeling may promote the phenomena typical for advanced disease: apoptosis and reduction in cell number as well as the appearance of dense pseudotendinous collagen matrix.

About two percent of fetuses exhibit a type of vitelline fistula characterized by persistence of the proximal part of the vitelline duct as a diverticulum protruding from the small intestine, Meckel's diverticulum, which is situated about two inches above the ileocecal junction and may be attached by a <b>fibrous</b> <b>cord</b> to the abdominal wall at the umbilicus.|$|E
40|$|Background Dupuytren’s contractures are <b>fibrous</b> <b>cords</b> {{under the}} skin of the palm of the hand. The contractures are painless but cause one or more fingers to curl into the palm, {{resulting}} in loss of function. Standard treatment within the NHS is surgery to remove (fasciectomy) or divide (fasciotomy) the contractures, and the treatment offered is frequently determined by surgeon preference. This study aims to determine the feasibility of conducting a large, multicentre randomised controlled trial to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of needle fasciotomy versus limited fasciectomy for the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture. Methods/design HAND- 1 is a parallel, two-arm, multicentre, randomised feasibility trial. Eligible patients aged 18 years or over who have one or more fingers with a Dupuytren’s contracture of more than 30 ° in the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and/or proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, well-defined cord(s) causing contracture, and have not undergone previous surgery for Dupuytren’s on the same hand will be randomised (1 : 1) to treatment with either needle fasciotomy or limited fasciectomy. Participants will be followed-up for up to 6 months post surgery. Feasibility outcomes include number of patients screened, consented and randomised, adherence with treatment, completion of follow-up and identification of an appropriate patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) to use as primary outcome for a main trial. Embedded qualitative research, incorporating a QuinteT Recruitment Intervention, will focus on understanding and optimising the recruitment process, and exploring patients’ experiences of trial participation and the interventions. Discussion This study will assess whether a large multicentre trial comparing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of needle fasciotomy and limited fasciectomy for the treatment of Dupuytren’s contractures is feasible, and if so will provide data to inform its design and successful conduct...|$|R
40|$|This {{extensive}} morphological study (macroscopy, x-ray, histology, histochemistry and electron microscopy) compares {{two types}} of bioprosthetic valves, porcine aortic (PAV) and bovine pericardial (BPV) of various models, both unimplanted (five) and explanted (229). There were 197 PAV and 32 BPV explanted from the mitral, aortic and tricuspid positions, with a mean duration of implantation of 70. 3 and 13. 5 months, respectively. Within that material, a smaller, rather homogeneous, series of 11 Carpentier-Edwards PAV (CE) and 11 Ionescu-Shiley BPV (IS) explants (mean implantation period 53 and 49, mean patient-age 45 and 47 years) made the comparison of clinical and macroscopic features more valid. In the total series, the leading causes of failure were cuspal tear/perforation with calcification in the PAV group (64 per cent); non-calcified leaflet rupture (27 per cent) and infective endocarditis (27 per cent) in the BPV group. In the small series of CE PAV and IS PAV, the characteristic modes of failure were calcified juxta-commissural cusp rupture for CE and non-calcified leaflet rupture at the suture for IS. The most characteristic x-ray features were calcification of <b>fibrous</b> <b>cords</b> irradiating from the commissures and calcific nodules in the centre in PAV and large plaques extending from the commissures and leaflet base in all directions in BPV. The main microscopic features of leaflet degradation were: the soaked sponge phenomenon (loosening and plasma and fat insudation) and the nodular, protein-rich calcification, both centred in the spongiosa, in PAV explants; important macrophagic activity and destruction of collagenous structures at the outflow layer and along the suture of the leaflets, with preservation of the middle layer, and the intrinsic calcification of the deep collagenous bundles, in BPV explants. Those alterations and other features are discussed with reference to leaflet structure and design, haemodynamics and possible causal mechanisms. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Obstructive lesions of {{the larynx}} and subglottic space are always a {{challenging}} problem for the endoscopist and anaesthetist. At this level, the efficacy and innocuity of a carbon dioxide laser treatment {{are related to the}} degree of endoscopic exposure. Thanks to the transtracheal high frequency jet ventilator, it is now possible to assure a free laryngeal endoscopic operative field. The transtracheal catheter is introduced percutaneously through the cricothyroid membrane into the trachea under endoscopic control and connected to a high frequency jet ventilator. From November 1983 to April 1985, this technique has been used in 65 cases. In 12 cases, it was the only alternative to avoid a tracheostomy.

30|$|The {{presence}} of the Meckel’s diverticulum is explained by the intrauterine evolution of the bowel. The initial embryological communication between the midgut and the yolk sac is made through the omphalomesenteric (vitelline) duct.

Different forms of congenital anomalies will result {{as a consequence of}} failure of closure and/or resorption of this embryological communication. The pattern of these anomalies depends on the degree of persistent ductal patency linking the ileum to the umbilicus; they may appear as <b>fibrous</b> <b>cord,</b> as ileo-umbilical fistula, or as omphalomesenteric cysts [2, 5].|$|E
