50|$|WNAX (570 AM) is a {{radio station}} in Yankton, South Dakota, {{currently}} owned by Saga Communications, which broadcasts a News/Talk format.

Among U.S. stations its <b>daytime</b> land <b>coverage</b> is exceeded only by KFYR in Bismarck, North Dakota, {{and in addition to}} its home market of Sioux City and Sioux Falls, WNAX provides a strong grade B signal to Omaha and Lincoln. During the day, it can be heard as far south as Kansas City, as far north as Fargo and well east of Des Moines.|$|R
50|$|Prior to {{the launch}} of E4 Music, E4 was off-air during daytime {{for much of the}} year, only going on air in <b>daytime</b> for rolling <b>coverage</b> of reality shows such as Big Brother. The {{introduction}} of E4 Music led to E4 broadcasting 24/7 all year round. Initially, E4 Music would take a summer break to allow Big Brother coverage to replace it, but in later years Big Brother coverage was reduced, allowing a cut-down E4 Music to run during the summer.|$|R
50|$|The {{directional}} aerial for 648 kHz (erected in 1981-82) {{consisted of a}} row of five 106.7 metre (350 ft) freestanding steel lattice towers of triangular cross section, insulated at their base. All five towers were driven. It was beamed at 131 degrees (i.e. south-east) though for practical purposes the exact bearing was nominal as the beam was very broad towards the east and south. It provided <b>daytime</b> <b>coverage</b> of Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, north-east France and north-west Germany by ground wave propagation; and night-time coverage of much of Europe by skywave propagation.|$|E
50|$|From 1926 to 2015--except for a {{short break}} from 1996 to 2001--KFAB was the home of Nebraska Cornhuskers sports. After 1948, it shared {{flagship}} status with Lincoln's KOLN/KLIN. However, in February 2015, the Cornhuskers moved their games to KXSP. School officials had long felt chagrin that KFAB {{was not willing to}} air all Olympic sports. For instance, volleyball and women's basketball games were shunted to KFFF, while baseball games were pre-empted altogether. School officials wanted to ensure that all Husker sports would air on a single, powerful station; KXSP's <b>daytime</b> <b>coverage</b> is roughly comparable to that of KFAB.|$|E
50|$|NVIS is {{most useful}} in mountainous areas where {{line-of-sight}} propagation at VHF or UHF frequencies is ineffective {{or when the}} communication distance is beyond the 50-mile (80 km) range of groundwave, and less than the 300-1500-mile (500-2500 km) range of lower angle sky-wave. Another interesting aspect of NVIS communication is, that direction finding of the sender is more difficult than for ground-wave communication (i.e. VHF or UHF). For broadcasters, NVIS allows coverage of an entire medium-sized country at much lower cost than with VHF (FM), and <b>daytime</b> <b>coverage</b> similar to MW (AM) nighttime coverage at lower cost and often with less interference.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a fully automated scheme {{that allows for}} the detection of contrails using the infrared channels of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The presented algorithm is adjusted to have a low rate of misdetection in spite of the low contrail detection efficiency resulting of this tuning. We derive a time-series and regional patterns of contrail cloudiness over Central and Western Europe. Daily analysis of noon scenes in 1996 indicates that the average of <b>daytime</b> contrail <b>coverage</b> over Central Europe was 0. 5 %#+-# 0. 25 % with regional maxima of 1. 2 %. Comparing noon and midnight scenes shows that nighttime contrail coverage, which is especially effective in greenhouse forcing, is approximately one third of that of daytime. (orig.)

40|$|The {{influence}} of contrails on the radiation budget depends mainly on their coverage and optical depth. This study derives these parameters from {{data of the}} advanced very high resolution radiometer sensor onboard the NOAA 14 satellite for a region over western Europe within 40 °– 56 °N and 10 °W– 23 °E during 2 years starting March 1995. The data are classified by an operational contrail detection algorithm with a new evaluation of the detection efficiency. From the classification results, <b>daytime</b> and nighttime <b>coverage</b> by line-shaped contrails over western Europe are derived. The <b>daytime</b> contrail <b>coverage</b> for the analyzed region is 0. 7 % in the annual mean, 1. 0 % during winter, and 0. 4 % during summer. The daytime contrail cover is 3 {{times higher than the}} night-time contrail cover. An effective optical depth of the observed contrails is derived from the radiation contrasts in the 11 μm channel for contrails and adjacent pixels. The optical depth in the visible spectral range is computed from these results assuming a previously measured size spectrum of ice crystals. The mean visible optical depth is found to be about 0. 1, much smaller than that derived from previous case studies. The average radiative forcing {{at the top of the}} atmosphere is computed for the derived contrail cloud cover and optical depth. Here contrails mostly cause positive radiative forcing (heating). Larger heating effects during night and summer get partly compensated through more contrail cover during day and winter. The radiative forcing by contrails in the examined region is ∼ 0. 03 W m- 2, which is much smaller than was estimated earlier...|$|R
50|$|Although {{the amount}} of sports content on the network has {{gradually}} expanded since Fox Sports was founded in 1994 (particularly since 2013), Fox's sports schedule on weekend afternoons has remained very inconsistent to this day as {{the majority of its}} sports contracts are with professional leagues and collegiate conferences associated with more widely known sporting events, with very limited supplementary coverage of amateur, extreme or winter sports (unlike NBC or CBS) that can be aired during the daytime even when major events are not broadcast - leaving absences in <b>daytime</b> sports <b>coverage</b> on either a Saturday, a Sunday or both on certain weeks. Syndicated programming (either in the form of feature films, series or both) and/or infomercials scheduled by the network's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates, as well as occasional Fox Sports-produced specials and Fox-supplied preview specials for upcoming primetime shows fill Fox stations' weekend afternoon schedules on days with limited to no sports programming.|$|R
