60|$|It {{has always}} been {{considered}} a very extraordinary proof of mental and moral degradation {{on the part of}} Nero, that he could thus descend from the exalted sphere of responsibility and duty to which his high official station properly consigned him, in order to mingle in such scenes and engage in such contests as were exhibited in the ordinary theaters and circuses in Greece. It is however not so surprising that he should have been willing to appear as a competitor at the Olympic games: so prominent were these games above all the other athletic and military celebrations of that age, and so great was the value attached to the honor of a victory obtained in them. There was, it is true, no value in the prize itself, that was bestowed upon the victors. There was no silver cup, or golden crown, or sum of money staked upon the issue. The only <b>direct</b> <b>award</b> was a crown of olive leaves, which, {{at the close of the}} contest, was placed upon the head of the victor. Everything pertaining to this crown was connected with the most imposing and peculiar ceremonies. The leaves from which the garland was made were obtained from a certain sacred olive-tree, which grew in a consecrated grove in Olympia. The tree itself had been originally brought, it was said, from the country of the Hyperboreans, by Hercules, and planted in Olympia, where it was sacredly preserved to furnish garlands for the victors in the games. The leaves were cut from the tree by a boy chosen for the purpose. He gathered the leaves by means of a golden sickle, which was set apart expressly to this use. When the time arrived for the crowning of the victor, the candidate was brought forward in presence of a vast concourse of spectators, and placed upon a tripod, which was originally formed of bronze, but in subsequent ages was wrought in ivory and gold. Branches of palm-trees, the usual symbols of victory, were placed in his hands. His name and that of his father and of the country whence he came, were proclaimed with great ceremony by the heralds. The crown was then placed upon his head, and the festival ended with processions and sacrifices and a public banquet given in honor of the occasion. On his return to his own country, the victor entered the capital by a triumphal procession, and was usually rewarded there by immunities and privileges of the most important character.|$|E

50|$|The West Coast {{controversy}} led to {{the introduction}} of the <b>Direct</b> <b>Award</b> concept, whereby the government can award a franchise that is up for renewal directly to the incumbent rather than through a tendering process, but only if the operator's proposed terms match the governments projected expectations of future performance based on its past record. If a reasonable contract cannot be drawn up through negotiation, the franchise is then re-let as normal. In the following few years, most franchises were renewed as Direct Awards, in part to achieve the smoothing out of the schedule recommended by Brown.|$|E

5000|$|The second {{government}} of Silvio Berlusconi (2001-2006) {{tried to give}} a second push to private sector participation. In 2001, it introduced norms that forced municipalities to award concessions to private companies, abolishing the <b>direct</b> <b>award</b> of concessions to public companies. However, faced with opposition, the norms were revised to allow direct “in-house” awards {{if it could be}} demonstrated that in-house provision was more efficient than a concession, or if utilities sold a majority share in their existing utilities. In the meantime, the foreign private companies that had entered the Italian water market in the late 1990s faced difficulties: [...] "Foreign players including Thames Water and Saur attempted to enter the Italian market only to become embroiled in never-ending political, regulatory and legal wrangles". For example, in Arezzo, three years after the contract had been awarded in 1999, the local government asked a subsidiary of the French water company Suez to reduce its management fee because the planned financing had not been mobilized. After lengthy confrontations, the local government and the company agreed to postpone needed investments.|$|E

5000|$|Torch Technologies was co-founded in 2002 in Huntsville, AL by Bill Roark and Don Holder. Roark and Holder {{respectively}} had 30 and 40 {{years of}} experience in Department of Defense research and development programs and other contracts. The company's location was chosen due to proximity to Redstone Arsenal, which serves as headquarters of several large Army organizations such as AMCOM and offices belonging to US Army Aviation. Upon the company's formation, the co-founders began to aggressively recruit a team of senior engineers, and set out to build a reputation for good service and competitive pricing. In 2005, Roark began to take steps that would allow Torch to become employee-owned (via an ESOP), and the company attained 100% employee ownership in 2010. Roark desired employee-ownership and profit sharing because such management styles have been proven to reduce employee attrition rates and increase job satisfaction. In 2008, Torch began bidding as a prime government contractor. With the receipt of four <b>direct</b> <b>award</b> prime task orders on AMCOM Express, the company won more contracts in two weeks in late 2008 than the previous six years of combined government work., In late 2016, Torch completed a $12 million renovation of the two existing buildings it owns in South Huntsville. [...] Torch received economic incentives from the city of Huntsville, the Tennessee Valley Authority and the state of Alabama to keep its headquarters in South Huntsville as opposed to moving to Cummings Research Park in hopes of growing economic activity in the immediate area. Torch has recently (2014-2016) expanded business into several new markets including Aberdeen, MD, Bedford, MA, Honolulu and Kauai.|$|E
40|$|Most {{countries}} {{contemplating the}} introduction of competition-based organizational forms did not perceive the British deregulated bus regime {{to be the way}} forward. A deeper analysis of facts and an international coverage of the local successes of that regime remained marginal and, as a result, the reputation of deregulated regimes remained bad or - at best - a contentious issue. The rush for competitive tendering was further stimulated by the European Commission's endeavour to enact a Regulation that put forward competitive tendering of exclusive contracts as the preferred way to organise local public transport markets. Yet, as discussed in this workshop, deregulation in various guises may well play a growing role in local and regional transport. This is already visible in long-distance coach transport and in (international) European railway markets as from 2010. The workshop paper discusses whether such competition-based institutional alternatives to competitive tendering can provide efficiency and service improvements, how such competition-based alternatives should be [`]regulated' and, alternatively, how a non-competitive <b>direct</b> <b>award</b> could perhaps still guarantee good performance.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009, {{published on}} September 8, 2009. The Act {{provides for the}} regulation of public bus passenger services, changes {{the name of the}} Dublin Transport Authority to the National Transport Authority and abolishes the Commission for Taxi Regulation. The economic importance of the Act is that it retains the restrictions on new market entry to the bus sector and continues to subsidise the sector by <b>direct</b> <b>award</b> subsidies. The policy options foregone by the Act are the alternatives of competition in the market by independent bus operators and competition through competitive tendering to provide bus services where subsidies are deemed necessary.

40|$|The goal of our {{paper is}} to present a set of {{analytical}} data connected with local services and their delivery arrangements, focusing on contracting out. Brief theoretical part of this paper shortly highlights theoretical issues of local service delivery and new alternative service delivery arrangements. Analytical part provides selected data on forms of delivery and the ways of selection of an external supplier, including comparisons with similar research data from Slovakia. This study uses a positive approach to investigate the research issue. The study analyzes the original collected survey data from own research project No. 402 / 05 / 2644 supported by Czech Scientific Foundation. A survey was conducted for each of selected local service {{to collect data on}} the structure of forms of delivery of service; the decision-making processes, concerning the selection of the delivery form; and in case of external delivery, the way/system selecting the external supplier and some other selected aspects of the contracting-out. The delivery of local services by external supplier or municipal firm is frequent solution. However, the selection of supplier is realized in many cases without any competition, via the <b>direct</b> <b>award,</b> resulting in non-transparency and bringing inefficiency risks.

40|$|Within the Italian legal framework, {{the award}} of social {{services}} is subject to very specific requirements due, in part, to the characteristics {{of social services}} themselves, and also to national and regional legislation which, by allowing derogations from the public tendering procedure, places non-profit entities at an advantage compared to other economic operators. ECJ case law has had a significant influence on the award procedure as, {{until a couple of}} years ago, it held that competition rules were not subject to derogations where legislation permits the <b>direct</b> <b>award</b> to third sector entities, according to the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity. This approach by EU judges has recently changed as regards the relationship between the market and the system for the protection of social rights, based on increased cooperation between public entities and the so-called “private social services”. Moreover, for the first time, EU legislation took particular account of public contracts and concessions in the social services sector. Furthermore on the 6 th of June, the Parliament has approved the Third Sector Reform act. The act provides a delegation to the Government for a comprehensive revision of all laws regarding the non –profits sector. The present article attempts to outline the new relationship which is being forged between competition, social services and the third sector by reviewing public procurement legislation and the relevant case law and by comparing previous provisions with those of Directive 2014 / 24 /UE and its implementing Decree no 50 of 18 April 2016, considering furthermore the provisions of the specific delegation power to the Government for adopting the Third Sector Code...|$|E

40|$|Healthcare is an {{important}} arena for improvement and innovation {{by the use of}} e-health solutions. But many obstacles exist, such as insufficiency in interoperability and usability. One reason for this problematic situation is that the development process has been inadequate. Swedish healthcare serves under regulations for public procurement. Hence, almost every e-health solution has to be procured to prevent an orientation towards illegal <b>direct</b> <b>award</b> of contracts. Specifying requirements that explain what the customer and users needs and why, {{is one of the most}} critical parts of that process. The customer gets what asked for, but often the requirements are on a high level of interpretation and not explicit or traceable enough. This prevents interoperability and usability from being a vital part of the prioritizing activity. Today knowledge about requirement processes and traceability is fragmented, and often more based on ideal models than on practical, real life experiences. The aim of this work is therefore to understand how traceability is managed and how it can be improved. I investigate who is most suitable to perform the “traceability activity” and, maybe even more important, the skill needed to fulfil that task. With a practice-based and ethnographical approach several studies have been conducted in different healthcare settings in Sweden, all closely connected to the design- and development process in e-health projects. The research shows that traceability maintains the relation between needs and solutions by providing a reality check for every step in the procurement and development. To accomplish that, requirements must be made explicit and interpretable for different stakeholders. The actors best suited for this “traceability activity” must have a holistic approach and know how to identify needs and relate them to the context. This demands a domain-specific knowledge about the healthcare setting and understanding how the organisation works practically and politically. It is crucial to also be skilled at usability, design, development and procurement. In addition, implementing IT in healthcare cannot be separated from business development. I argue that it is time to update the way healthcare development is managed and by whom. First, healthcare management must pay more attention on usability and the crucial role that healthcare professionals have as change leaders and needfinders to strengthening existing initiatives. Second, the design community must match existing initiatives and roles in healthcare with the designers’ special knowledge to support innovation and design processes...|$|E
40|$|Today’s power {{generation}} market in Malaysia {{has evolved into}} a competitive market. In the beginning, there was no competition. The market was monopolised by a single utility. A nation-wide blackout triggered the introduction of independent power producers (IPPs) into the market in 1993. The market was transformed into an oligopoly market dominated by a few politically linked companies. These pioneering IPPs were awarded with IPP concessions without open tender. Pressured by increasing cost of fuel, the Malaysian government in recent times have decided to open the market to new players. Open tender will create competition that will eventually drive down electricity tariffs to the consumers. So, where does sustainable innovation fits into the {{power generation}} market in Malaysia? Sustainable innovation considers impact on the 3 Ps; Planet, People and Profit. In the modern era where the public is demanding that the earth and its inhabitants be protected and the shareholders are demanding profit, all innovation must consider sustainability. Power generation in Malaysia has never been perceived as an innovative industry. <b>Direct</b> <b>award</b> of concessions resulted in lucrative financial returns. Long term power purchase agreement with terms favourable to the IPPs meant that the IPPs were not in any pressure to improve as long they delivered power as contracted. Generating power was business as usual. However, the market has transformed. The pioneering IPPs now have to compete not just amongst existing IPPs, but also against new players. Open tender meant the IPPs must submit the lowest levelised tariff in order to win. The concessions are no longer as lucrative as before. The PPA terms are now favouring the buyer. In order to compete, the pioneering IPPs must rid themselves of their legacies from the old market and transform their firms into competitive firms. They must innovate in order to gain competitive advantage over their rivals. All innovation initiatives by the IPPs in Malaysia must consider sustainable innovation. The main purpose of this management project (MP) is to assess whether the IPPs in Malaysia are managing with the changing competitive landscape in Malaysia’s power generation market through sustainable innovation. The MP reviewed theories and literatures to better understand innovation, its drivers, the barriers and how best to manage innovation. The MP searched for existing innovations in the power generation industry globally in order to better understand the industry. The MP expanded the study by exploring if the culture and environment in Malaysia have any influence on how the IPPs manage innovation. The MP used both qualitative and quantitative methods based on established theories in order to perform the assessments. Using two different methods enabled the MP to check for consistencies of information. Where there were inconsistencies, the MP performed in depth analysis. To gain insights that were not available from the public domain, the MP selected senior executives from those companies as subjects...|$|E
