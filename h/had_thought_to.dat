5|$|Upon {{his return}} home, Shelby {{and his father}} were named commissioners to {{negotiate}} a treaty between colonial settlers and the Chickamauga. This service delayed his return to Greene, but in October 1781 he and Sevier led 600 riflemen to join Greene in South Carolina. Greene <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> use Shelby's and Sevier's men to prevent Cornwallis from returning to Charleston. However, Cornwallis was defeated at the Siege of Yorktown, shortly after Shelby and Sevier arrived, and Greene sent them on to join General Francis Marion on the Pee Dee River. On Marion's orders, Shelby and Colonel Hezekiah Maham captured a British fort at Fair Lawn near Moncks Corner on November 27, 1781.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise then learns of {{an unmarked}} vessel {{approaching}} Haven. Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) recognizes it as Tarellian, {{a race that}} they <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be wiped out by a highly lethal and contagious virus. When they contact the ship, they find a handful of Tarellian refugees that have been travelling at sub-light speeds to Haven in hopes of finding an isolated location to live {{out the rest of}} their lives in peace. Picard insists they cannot go to the planet for fear of spreading the virus, and has the Tarellian vessel placed in a tractor beam. Wyatt recognizes one of the Tarellians, Ariana (Danitza Kingsley), from his dreams, and she too recognizes Wyatt. Wyatt tells Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) that he will transport some medical supplies to them, but transports himself along with the supplies. When the crew discovers this, Wyatt's parents demand Picard bring Wyatt back to the Enterprise, but Picard insists that he cannot return, as Wyatt would now carry the Tarellian virus. Wyatt promises his parents, Troi, and the rest of the crew that he knew that this would be destiny, and is happy to try to help cure the Tarellian virus. Wyatt convinces the Tarellians to leave Haven and search for help elsewhere. Picard orders the tractor beam to be dropped and allows the vessel to depart the system.|$|E
5|$|The most bitter {{legal battle}} began in 1809. Evans sued Samuel Robinson—a miller near Baltimore who was using Evans's {{improvements}} {{without a license}} to produce a very modest amount of flour—for damages of $2,500. That sum was deemed unjustifiably high and harsh by many, and Evans's actions rallied the Baltimore community against him, and when the case was finally heard in 1812 many appeared {{in support of the}} defendant. Evans's detractors presented evidence and witnesses at the trial to press the argument that Evans did not truly invent much of what his patents protected. Although the hopper-boy was undoubtedly original, the use of bucket chains and Archimedean screws had been used since ancient times and Evans had only modified some of their features and adapted them for use in a milling context. A now retired Thomas Jefferson weighed into the debate in letters to both Evans and his detractors, questioning the philosophy of patent law and what truly defined 'invention' and 'machine' (and to some extent the validity of his claims) but ultimately defended the purpose of patent law, which was to incentivize innovation by rewarding inventors for their development and sharing of new technology. And Jefferson noted that though Evans's designs consisted of devices that had long existed beforehand, everyone had access to these and yet only Evans <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> modify and use them in conjunction to build an automatic mill. Ultimately the jury found in favor of Evans, but it was a pyrrhic victory as Evans had put most of the milling community offside in the process, and ultimately reduced his claim against Robinson to $1,000. In response, prominent Evans critic Isaac McPherson, made submission to Congress {{in the wake of the}} trial entitled Memorial to the Congress of Sundry Citizens of the United States, Praying Relief from the Oppressive Operations of Oliver Evans' Patent, seeking to limit the compensation Evans could seek for his patent's use or for Congress to void it altogether. Although the Senate drafted a bill that would roll-back some of Evans's patent rights, it did not pass, and he continued to vigorously pursue his patent fees. It would not be until the Patent Act of 1836 that many of these issues, including what constituted originality in the context of a patent, would be addressed.|$|E

25|$|Due to the agreement, Doom is {{recommended}} by Nathaniel and Valeria Richards to {{be a member}} of the Future Foundation. Objecting, Thing attacks Doom out of anger, but the fight is stopped by Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman, who welcomes Doom to their group. Leading to the Secret Wars, Doom usurps the power of the Beyonders with the aid of Doctor Strange and the Molecule Man, collecting what he can of the destroyed multiverse and forming a new Battleworld consisting of different alternate realities. He also assumes the role of God and claims complete dominion of this new world and its inhabitants, controlling them into thinking he was always the almighty force of creation; following Reed's apparent demise, he takes Sue as his wife, and Franklin, and Valeria as his children. He convinces Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm to be the sun and the Shield wall respectively in Battleworld. However, Richards and a ragtag collection of heroes and villains that survived the destruction of all universes are able to challenge him and, with the help of Molecule Man, are able to take his power and restore the multiverse, something Doom <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be impossible. Opting to heal rather than harm, Reed finally uses the Beyonder's power to heal Doom's face, and to purify his soul.|$|E

500|$|Early in {{the design}} process the [...] "Committee on Designs" [...] <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> power these ships with the {{traditional}} reciprocating vertical triple-expansion steam engines, but were persuaded to adopt Parsons steam turbines as they required fewer boilers {{for the same amount}} of power, were easier to protect from damage as they were more compact than reciprocating engines and could be kept below the waterline. In addition they were significantly lighter and more reliable than the older design. The direct drive turbines then in use did have one significant drawback in that they ran at a relatively high speed which required small-diameter, fine-pitch propellers of a large blade area which adversely affected manoeuvrability at low speeds. Parsons alleviated this problem by his suggestion of fitting more powerful astern turbines on all four shafts, which could increase manoeuvrability by reversing the turbines as needed.|$|E

500|$|The {{new system}} of {{government}} in Athens opened up a wealth of opportunity for men like Themistocles, who previously {{would have had no}} access to power. Moreover, the new institutions of the democracy required skills that had previously been unimportant in government. Themistocles was to prove himself a master of the new system; [...] "he could infight, he could network, he could spin... and crucially, he knew how to make himself visible." [...] Themistocles moved to the Ceramicus, a down-market part of Athens. This move marked him out as a 'man of the people', and allowed him to interact more easily with ordinary citizens. He began building up a support base among these newly empowered citizens: [...] "he wooed the poor; and they, not used to being courted, duly loved him back. Touring the taverns, the markets, the docks, canvassing where no politician <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> canvas before, making sure never to forget a single voter's name, Themistocles had set his eyes on a radical new constituency" [...] However, he took care to ensure that he did not alienate the nobility of Athens. He began to practice law, the first person in Athens to prepare for public life in this way. His ability as attorney and arbitrator, used {{in the service of the}} common people, gained him further popularity.|$|E
500|$|Pilgrim {{is often}} {{noted for its}} study of theodicy, or its defense of God's {{goodness}} {{in the face of}} evil.

[...] A passage in the second chapter of the book describes a frog being [...] "sucked dry" [...] by a [...] "giant water bug" [...] as the narrator watches; this necessary cruelty shows order in life and death, no matter how difficult it may be to watch. [...] The narrator especially sees inherent cruelty in the insect world: [...] "Fish gotta swim and birds gotta fly... insects, it seems, gotta do one horrible thing after another. I never ask why of a vulture or a shark, but I ask why of almost every insect I see. More than one insect... is an assault on all human virtue, all hope of a reasonable god."

Farmer's farewell address for the 1899 season was printed in the Boston Evening Transcript and contained warm thoughts of the development of the work and its ongoing goals. A beatific booklet Greenacre on the Piscataqua of some 22 pages with a section written in August 1899 and another in September 1900 was published. Bahá'ís have identified a quote from the religion in the 1899 program and speculate Farmer had heard of the religion. However, in Farmer's life and the structure of Greenacre there was crisis.
