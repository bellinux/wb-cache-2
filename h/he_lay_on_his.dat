5|$|Enquiries about insect {{pollination}} led in 1861 to novel studies of wild orchids, showing adaptation of their flowers to attract specific moths to each species and ensure cross fertilisation. In 1862 Fertilisation of Orchids gave his first detailed {{demonstration of the}} power of natural selection to explain complex ecological relationships, making testable predictions. As his health declined, <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> sickbed in a room filled with inventive experiments to trace the movements of climbing plants. Admiring visitors included Ernst Haeckel, a zealous proponent of Darwinismus incorporating Lamarckism and Goethe's idealism. Wallace remained supportive, though he increasingly turned to Spiritualism.|$|E
25|$|Herrera {{turned his}} prisoners over to men in his squad, then started {{crawling}} {{toward the other}} machine gun, firing as he went. (“My M-1 was talking, and the Germans understood what it was saying,” he commented later.) The position was protected by a minefield; GIs were throwing rocks into the area {{in an effort to}} explode the mines. Herrera got up and charged the Germans anyway, but as he neared the machine-gun nest, he stepped on a mine. He was thrown to the ground, both of his feet blown off at the ankle. Though bleeding heavily, <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> stomach and fired at the Germans, forcing them to stay down and thus enabling his squad to skirt the minefield, flank the enemy, and move in for the kill.|$|E
2500|$|After two men {{associated}} with the radical branch of Neturei Karta participated in a 2004 prayer vigil for Yasser Arafat outside the Percy Military Hospital in Paris, France, where <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> death bed, the radical branch of Neturei Karta was widely condemned by other Orthodox Jewish organizations, including many other anti-Zionist Haredi organizations both in New York and Jerusalem. Moshe Hirsch, and what Hirsch's faction described as an [...] "impressive contingent" [...] of other members, attended Arafat's funeral in Ramallah.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>lay</b> down, <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back, <b>on</b> my table, {{and with}} that action of his head threw up his beard at the chin.|$|R
60|$|He {{had time}} to finish these letters before the lights were put out. When <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> down <b>on</b> <b>his</b> straw bed, {{he thought he had}} done with this world.|$|R
5000|$|Páidín O'Maelchonaire, i.e. preceptor {{of the men}} of Erinn {{in poetry}} and history, died a sudden death this year—i.e. <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> down <b>on</b> <b>his</b> bed quite well, and {{was found dead in}} the morning.|$|R
2500|$|The {{text and}} melody of Rodigast's hymn were {{published}} {{together for the}} first time in 1690 in the Nürnbergische Gesangbuch, with the composer marked as [...] "anonymous". Before that the melody with the hymn title had already been used by Pachelbel for an organ partita in 1683. Taking into account the appearance of the melody in the Klesch hymnbook and the history of the hymn given in the 1687 Nordhausen Gesangbuch, the Swiss theologian and musicologist Andreas Marti has suggested that it is plausible that, as <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> sick-bed in Jena, the cantor Severus Gastorius had the melody of Fabricius spinning [...] around in his head as an [...] "earworm" [...] and was inspired to add a second half.|$|E
2500|$|... "But one Persian, a young man, {{riding up}} {{very close to}} the Roman army, began to {{challenge}} all of them, calling for whoever wished to do battle with him. And no one of the whole army dared face the danger, except a certain Andreas, one of the personal attendants of Bouzes, not a soldier nor one who had ever practised at all the business of war, but a trainer of youths in charge of a certain wrestling school in Byzantium. Through this it came about that he was following the army, for he cared for the person of Bouzes in the bath; his birthplace was Byzantium. This man alone had the courage, without being ordered by Bouzes or anyone else, to go out of his own accord to meet the man in single combat. And he caught the barbarian while still considering how he should deliver his attack, and hit him with his spear on the right breast. And the Persian did not bear the blow delivered by a man of such exceptional strength, and fell from his horse to the earth. Then Andreas with a small knife slew him like a sacrificial animal as <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back, and a mighty shout was raised both from the city wall and from the Roman army." ...|$|E
60|$|Anne Seaway {{was about}} to run away likewise, when she {{turned and looked at}} the fallen man. <b>He</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face, motionless.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{must have}} been chance," [...] he muttered to himself as <b>he</b> again <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> oars {{awaiting}} the whale's reappearance, [...] "a sort of happy accident. I feel convinced I could not do it so well a second time." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>lay</b> tossing <b>on</b> <b>his</b> thorny bed one evening, Henry, {{who would}} not quit him, {{watching}} faithfully beside him, when a tap--too light {{to be that of}} Mrs. Gill or the housemaid--summoned young Sympson to the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have!" [...] said he to himself. [...] "It {{may be that}} {{we shall}} have it as that poor fellow had his bag of gold, when <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> down <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back to die there in the wild desert." ...|$|R
60|$|Ortheris {{heaved a}} big sigh, as <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> stomach {{with his head}} between his fists. Then he swore quietly into the blue sky.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why should I {{work you}} harm?" [...] the half-drunken soldier asked as <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> belly in the {{aperture}} {{looking up at}} the small lad.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would not}} be a traitor," [...] {{returned}} Humfrey, as <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back, looking up through the chequerwork of the branches of the trees towards the sky.|$|E
6000|$|Many a {{time that}} night did Henri [...] "veesh it vas to-morrow," [...] as <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> {{helpless}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back, looking up through {{the roof of the}} chief's tent at the stars, and listening enviously to the plethoric snoring of Joe Blunt.|$|R
6000|$|... "Confound the vulgar thief!" [...] muttard my master, as <b>he</b> was <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> sophy, {{after being}} so very ill; [...] "I've {{poisoned}} myself with his infernal tobacco, {{and he has}} foiled me. The cursed swindling boor! he thinks he'll ruin this poor Cheese-monger, does he? I'll step in, and WARN him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said <b>he,</b> as <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> resting <b>on</b> <b>his</b> elbows {{with the}} rifle laid {{ready to hand}} and the {{revolver}} beside it; [...] "now, I know not vezer you can smell or not, but I have buried mineself in eart', vich is a non-conductor of smell. Ve shall see!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you mixing {{that other}} bowl of punch?" [...] said Stryver the portly, {{with his hands}} in his waistband, glancing round from the sofa where <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> {{back and}} {{stared up at}} me, and his eyes had a glassy stare. Then he roused himself by an effort, and raised himself upon his elbow.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> bed and solemnly [...] "signed," [...] Gasping--perhaps 'twas a jest he meant: [...] "This of a {{sound and}} {{disposing}} mind [...] Is the last ill-will and contestament." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an April 2011 interview, Blake Sennett said, [...] "I {{would say}} that if Rilo Kiley were ... hmmm ... a human being ... hmmm ... <b>he's</b> {{probably}} <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back in a morgue with a tag <b>on</b> <b>his</b> toe. Now, I see movies where the dead get up and walk. And when they do that, rarely do good things happen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' he said, 'better {{get back}} to the House. You overdid it yesterday. Lie down somewhere. G'bye.' And he got into his stride again. Jim watched his figure diminish, until at last it was a shapeless dot of white against the brown surface. Then <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> down <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back and panted.|$|R
60|$|He {{had hardly}} gone many steps when he {{stumbled}} over a huge giant, {{who had been}} lulled to sleep by the music. This {{was one of the}} guards of the castle! As <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> there <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back, <b>he</b> seemed so big that in spite of Petru's haste he stopped to measure him.|$|R
60|$|He {{passed the}} day {{talking with the}} ants and beetles and exchanging jokes with the light-hearted butterflies. And at night <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> bed of soft moss and slept soundly.|$|E
60|$|Psmith, however, did {{not seem}} to desire conversation. <b>He</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> sofa {{motionless}} for a quarter of an hour, then reached out for a large book which lay on the table, and began to read.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face {{until he}} was frightened by a noise louder than thunder in the daytime--the {{scraping}} of his eyelashes on the pillow. Then he sat up in the wardrobe and fired his three last shots.|$|E
60|$|As for {{the poor}} soldier, <b>he</b> just <b>lay</b> flat <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back and stared with eyes like saucers, for he thought that his end had come for sure.|$|R
60|$|As <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> there <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back, scorched, tormented with thirst and helpless, {{he watched}} with fearful anxiety each {{motion of the}} madman. For some moments Zeppa seemed undecided. He stood with heaving chest {{expanding}} nostrils, and flashing eyes, gazing after the flying crew of natives. Then he turned sharply on the unhappy man who lay at his feet.|$|R
6000|$|Tedham {{took a few}} thin, worn {{letters from}} his breast-pocket [...] "There is Mr. March's letter," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>laying</b> one <b>on</b> <b>his</b> knee. <b>He</b> handed my wife another.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back, {{breathing}} {{with great}} difficulty. Do what he would, and love me though he did, the light left his face ever and again, and a film {{came over the}} placid look at the white ceiling.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> bed {{for four}} months {{with the effects of}} that wound; and the same post which {{conveyed}} to Lady Lyndon the news of the duel, carried her a message from Captain Fireball to say, 'This is NUMBER ONE!' ...|$|E
6000|$|Both the brothers' brows clouded at once. Amyas, as <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> {{back on the}} pebbles, {{said quietly}} to the gulls over his head--"I wonder what the Frenchman whose head I cut off at the Azores, thinks by now about all that." ...|$|E
60|$|Early {{the next}} morning, just {{as on the}} morning before, Blacky stopped over by Reddy's house. This time Reddy was already home. Actually {{he was waiting for}} Blacky, though he wouldn't have had Blacky know it for the world. As soon as he saw Blacky coming, <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> down <b>on</b> <b>his</b> {{doorstep}} and pretended not to see Blacky at all.|$|R
50|$|The tower {{looks out}} over the River Yamuna and is {{traditionally}} considered to have one of the most poignant views of the Taj Mahal. It is here that Shah Jahan along with his favorite daughter Jahanara Begum had spent his last few years as a captive of his son Aurangzeb. <b>He</b> <b>lay</b> here <b>on</b> <b>his</b> death bed while gazing at the Taj Mahal in Agra.|$|R
60|$|Hour after hour, indeed, <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> there <b>on</b> <b>his</b> bed, {{afraid to}} toss or turn lest he should wake Lady Emily, {{but with his}} limbs all fevered and his throat all parched, {{thinking}} over the strange chance that had thus brought him face to face, {{on the threshold of}} his honoured age, with the two lads he had wronged so long and so cruelly.|$|R
