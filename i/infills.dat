25|$|Numerous cave {{paintings}} from the Neolithic period {{are found in}} the Laas Geel complex, on the outskirts of Hargeisa. During November and December 2002, an archaeological survey was carried out in the area by a French team of researchers. The expedition's objective was to search for rock shelters and caves containing stratified archaeological <b>infills</b> capable of documenting the period when production economy appeared in this part of Somaliland (circa 5th and 2nd millennium BCE). During the course of the survey, the French archaeological team discovered the Laas Geel rock art, encompassing an area of ten rock alcoves (caves). In an excellent state of preservation, the paintings show human figures with their hands raised and facing long-horned, humpless cattle.|$|E
25|$|Ottawa {{has several}} older neighbourhoods {{clustered}} around the downtown core, including the Glebe, Sandy Hill, New Edinburgh, Centretown, Lower Town and Old Ottawa South. These areas were mainly built up {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries. The houses in these areas tend to be in Victorian or Queen Anne style, but rarely have any conspicuous ornamentation. These are usually two or three storey single homes. Recent <b>infills</b> in these neighbourhoods have often taken the form of townhouses. Red brick, sometimes painted other colours, is the dominant surface material. Most houses have sizable lots, with a driveway running to a shed, or a small lane way running behind the buildings. In the 1920s and 1930s new styles were imported, and many houses from this era take inspiration from the Arts and crafts and Prairie styles.|$|E
25|$|A {{masterplan}} for {{the future}} of the site was drawn up in 2012, comprising six 'big ideas' to restore and redevelop the palace. The first of these to be implemented aims to transform the derelict eastern end of the palace, making accessible the Victorian theatre and historic BBC Studios. In 2013 the Heritage Lottery Fund awarded a Round 1 pass to develop the proposals, creating a new entrance in the restored East Court, re-establishing the theatre as a flexible performance space and re-opening the BBC Studios as a visitor attraction. There is currently controversy regarding plans to demolish the brick <b>infills</b> in the colonnade on the south-east face of the building, which the BBC constructed after 1936 to form their television studios within. Following a public consultation and advice from English Heritage, Planning and Listed Building Consent was given for the proposals and in March 2015 HLF awarded Round 2 major grant funding securing a positive future for the historic areas.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Infilling</b> rock joints widely {{exist in}} natural rock masses, and the shear failure of <b>infilling</b> rock joints plays an {{important}} role in the instability of rock masses. In order to study the shear failure mechanism of <b>infilling</b> rock joints, Particle Flow Code is used to simulate the direct shear test of <b>infilling</b> rock joints. The PFC models with different <b>infilling</b> thickness are established firstly, and then the procedures of PFC simulation are described. In the end, the shear failure process of <b>infilling</b> rock joints with different <b>infilling</b> thickness is simulated. Based on the PFC simulation results, it can be concluded that the shear failure mode changes with increasing <b>infilling</b> thickness, and the shearing of the <b>infilling</b> rock joint rarely gives birth to microcracks in rock due to the existence of the <b>infilling</b> material...|$|R

ABSTRACT: <b>Infilled</b> steel frame structures are known to perform better as compared to <b>infilled</b> concrete frames under seismic loading. In comparison with masonry <b>infilled</b> reinforced concrete (RC) frame structures, very {{little research has been}} done on masonry <b>infilled</b> steel frames structures. Contribution of masonry <b>infill</b> in the positive performance of the <b>infilled</b> structures is widely recognized but no codes provide the clear and detailed guidelines on the design of <b>infilled</b> frame structures especially <b>infilled</b> steel frame structures due to the complex and unpredictable behaviour of masonry during an earthquake event. This study aims to provide a detailed insight into the composite behaviour of steel frame structures with unreinforced masonry <b>infill</b> under seismic loading. Time history analyses have been performed on masonry <b>infilled</b> steel moment resisting frame structures and structural performance has been evaluated in terms of global structural performance parameters of fundamental time period, maximum roof displacement and base shear and local parameters of interstorey drift ratios, structural member forces and <b>infill</b> stresses. The effect of masonry <b>infill</b> on the performance of <b>infilled</b> steel moment resisting frames has been investigated by varying the number of bays, number of storeys, percentage opening in the <b>infill</b> wall, location of the opening, type of openings, number of openings, <b>infill</b> strength, outer frame strength and <b>infill</b> thickness. The results of this research will help to understand the complex behaviour of masonry <b>infilled</b> steel frames for different variation...|$|R

40|$|The {{construction}} of RC buildings with unreinforced <b>infill</b> {{wall is a}} regular practice in India. <b>Infill</b> panels have usually been made of heavy rigid materials, such as clay bricks or concrete blocks. However, more lightweight and flexible <b>infill</b> options such as AAC (aerated light weight concrete) blocks are now obtainable in India {{to be used as}} masonry <b>infill</b> (MI) material in reinforced concrete (RC) framed buildings. It has been accepted that <b>infill</b> materials considerably influence the seismic performance of the <b>infilled</b> framed structures. Number of researchers studied the behaviour of <b>infilled</b> RC frames experimentally and analytically. Most of the research work carried out in this area was paying attention on parameters such as the variation of distribution of masonry <b>infill</b> and the stiffness of frame elements.

2500|$|Significant {{differences}} {{in the construction of}} the Sutton Hoo and Scandinavian helmets belie significant similarities in their designs. The Scandinavian helmets that are capable of restoration were constructed more simply than the Sutton Hoo helmet. None has a face mask, solid neck guard, or cap made from one piece of metal, and only two have distinct cheek guards. The neck guards [...] "seem without exception to have [...] either iron strips or protective mail curtains." [...] The helmets from Ultuna, Vendel 14 and Valsgärde 5 all used iron strips as neck protection; five strips hung from the rear of the Vendel 14 and Valsgärde 5 brow bands, and though only two strips survive from the Ultuna helmet, others would have hung alongside them. Camail was used on the remaining helmets, from Valsgärde 6, 7 and 8, and from Vendel 1 and 12. Fragmentary remains from Vendel 10 and 11, and from Solberga, likewise suggest camail. In terms of cheek protection, only two helmets had something other than continuations of the camail or iron strips used to protect the neck. The Vendel 14 helmet had cheek guards, but of [...] "a differing version well forward on the face" [...] of those on the Sutton Hoo helmet. Though [...] "difficult to reconstruct," [...] fragments from the Broa helmet suggest a configuration similar to those on the Vendel 14 helmet. Finally, the widely varying caps on each Scandinavian helmet all share one feature: None is similar to the cap on the Sutton Hoo helmet. The basic form of the helmets from Vendel, Valsgärde, Ultuna and Broa all started with a brow band and nose-to-nape band. The Ultuna helmet had its sides filled in with latticed iron strips, while each side on the Valsgärde 8 helmet was filled in with six parallel strips running from the brow band to the nose-to-nape brand. The remaining four helmets—excepting those from Vendel 1 and 10, and Broa, which are too fragmentary to determine their exact construction—all employed two lateral bands and sectional <b>infills.</b> The Vendel 14 helmet had eight infill plates, one rectangular and one triangular per quadrant; that from Valsgärde 7 helmet used four infill plates, one for each quadrant; the one from Valsgärde 6 also used identical <b>infills</b> for each quadrant, but with [...] "elaborate" [...] Y-shaped iron strips creating a latticed effect; and the Valsgärde 5 example filled in the back two quadrants with latticed iron strips, and the front two quadrants each with a rectangular section of lattice work and a triangular plate.|$|E

40|$|Smart growth policies, {{in order}} to curtail low-density sprawl, seek to {{increase}} development in existing communities. These policies promote <b>infill</b> development, projects built on underutilized parcels in and surrounded by developed areas. While smart growth advocates view reduced sprawl as a benefit, local residents often fear <b>infill</b> will increase traffic congestion, eliminate open space, and result in other costs. Unfortunately, we know little about <b>infill</b> development overall and its impacts specifically. This dissertation addresses this gap by exploring residential <b>infill</b> development in Montgomery County, MD during the l 990 s and early 2000 s. This highly developed suburban jurisdiction experienced growing pains due to increased development during this time. The county also saw smart growth policies enacted, making it an excellent case study. The research first describes county residential <b>infill</b> trends from 1990 to 2006 and identifies <b>infill</b> sites. This section defines and offers a measure for <b>infill</b> development and identifies trends and patterns, focusing on changes in <b>infill</b> levels or characteristics. Next, the research uses hedonic pricing models to explore changes in nearby home values pre- and post-infill. A difference-in-difference design provides a comparison group analysis. Twenty-six <b>infill</b> sites were selected because they were built in relatively undisturbed residential neighborhoods, making such analysis possible. This research found <b>infill</b> to be a common occurrence throughout the study period, regularly comprising 70 % of all residential units built. The study did not find changes in <b>infill</b> development coinciding with a particular smart growth policy. Instead, <b>infill</b> mimicked overall development trends. <b>Infill</b> did have considerably smaller lot and structure sizes than non-infill. The hedonic pricing models found negative impacts on home values associated with some <b>infill</b> projects, with price declines ranging from 2 to 5 %. The impact varied by development type, with large projects causing the greatest price declines. Additionally, wealthier neighborhoods experienced a negative <b>infill</b> home price effect, while poorer areas experienced a positive effect [...] although not significant. Overall, positive outcomes were not the rule, and <b>infill</b> appears to generate costs. Planners and policymakers need to take this in to consideration when promoting <b>infill...</b>|$|R

Three 1 m 2 test surfaces were constructed by placing synthetic turf over a stone-tar-macadam-rubber shockpad sub-base. Ball rebound, ball roll, surface rebound hardness and rotational resistance of a dimpled rubber sole were measured for a range of <b>infill</b> quantities (0 - 35 kg/m 2) and <b>infill</b> contamination concentrations (0, 10 and 20 %). Increasing <b>infill</b> quantity increased hardness, reduced ball rebound and reduced rotational resistance linearly (p, 0. 01).

An optimum <b>infill</b> quantity of 25 - 30 kg/m 2, based on performance characteristics and the length of fibre above the <b>infill,</b> was identified for the synthetic turf surface tested.

A previously developed and validated three dimensional finite element models based on the simplified micro-modelling technique were adopted in this study to investigate the behaviour of <b>infilled</b> steel and reinforced concrete frames under lateral in-plane loads. The investigated parameters include: the <b>infill</b> wall stiffness, the presence and size of haunches at the beam-column connections. The effect of <b>infill</b> wall stiffness was investigated by analysis of steel and concrete frames <b>infilled</b> with grouted <b>infill</b> walls, which were found to significantly improve the lateral strength and stiffness of the <b>infilled</b> frames.
