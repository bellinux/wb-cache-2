40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a tomographic system by employing optical sensors using low cost approach. The final aim of this project is achieving real-time monitoring of solid particles having low concentration flow when conveyed in vertical pneumatic conveyor. The developed tomography system consists of 32 pairs of Light Emitting Diode (LED) and silicon PIN photodiode. These sensors are used to monitor the emitted radiation for fluctuations caused by particles interfering with the beam when passing through it. A good design of sensor fixture may increase the collimating of light beam from a light source that passes through a flow regime. The obtained information from sensors provided the cross-sectional material <b>distribution</b> in <b>conveyor.</b> By using this information, the relationships between particle distribution and light attenuation effects are investigated by using computer programming to reconstruct the image. The results obtained from this investigation shows that the low cost optical sensors are suitable for monitoring low and medium concentration flowing materials. Optical sensors provide an opportunity to design sensors with a very wide bandwidth, thus enabling the measurement of high speed flowing particles or droplets. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This work {{presents}} a methodology to compute dynamic stress <b>distributions</b> on large <b>conveyor</b> belts considering a viscous-damping model. Results {{could be very}} useful at the conveyor design stage since at starts and stops of the system, large dynamic loads may be encountered. Such loads may produce a catastrophic failure of the conveyor, with important direct and downtime costs. We present a finite- element based methodology and use the Newmark time-integration method to solve the transient responses. Our scheme includes the effects of damping. A real-life industrial case is analyzed and three critical situations are considered: normal stop, sudden stop, suddenly aborted start. Results are shown in terms of dynamic loads at critical points of the system. The simulations show that the damping effects are negligible {{in the analysis of}} real-life designs, thus allowing the use of the analytical solution. For the analized case, maximum loads obtained with the present methodology are smaller in 5 % than those obtained with the conservative approach...|$|R

In Visakhapatnam steel plant is one such shore based process industry operating at 120 % of rated capacity of 3. 0 MT/annum. Liquid steel {{is in the process of}} expanding its capacity to 6. 3 million ton per annum, around 24 MT/annum of bulk materials are to be handled in Visakhapatnam steel plant(VSP). VSP is equipped with peripheral unloading yard for the first time in India to unload the bulk materials in plant premises by transporting by locos, to plant wagon pushers of railways. Raw material plant in VSP is having unloading facilities like rotary wagon tripper, storage yard with machines for stacking and reclaiming and <b>distribution</b> belt <b>conveyor</b> system to feed various raw materials to different process plants by proportioning and by sizing. Thus stackers play a critical role in meeting the demand of bulk material. This project deals with the strengthen of MAST HEAD of twin boom stacker by redesigning to avoid frequent failures. The twin boom stacker is used to stack the raw material in two parallel yards depending on the requirement. The reliability of the twin boom stacker is utmost important for stacking the materials in the storage yard for better logistics. The ageing of twin boom stacker with the prolonged operation resulted in uneven loads or jerks on MAST HEAD. This has resulted in frequent failures of MAST HEAD. The design modification has been verified by modeling the MAST HEAD using SOLIDWORKS Version 2012 and analyzed using FEM package ANSYS 14. 5. The Necessary stress strengthening has been made based on the preliminary analysis by increasing the thickness of the spacer and observed that the stresses are within the tolerable limits and are discussed in the topic RESULTS...|$|R

40|$|Dissertação de Mestrado em Engenharia Mecânica, especialidade em Engenharia e Gestão Industrial; apresentada à Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade de Coimbra. Uma casa CoolHaven é constituída por módulos standard, também designados por paredes, que permitem a formação de qualquer tipologia, podendo adaptar-se a um projecto já existente ou a um novo ao gosto do próprio cliente. Estes módulos possuem dimensões optimizadas e podem ter três tipologias: cantos, pilares e paredes. Um módulo parede é constituído por 4 componentes diferentes: uma estrutura metálica que é revestida com lã de rocha e placas OSB, Oriented Strand Board, em ambos os lados e ainda uma estrutura auxiliar, em madeira, para o espaçamento (“ripado”). A montagem das paredes inclui as tarefas: rebitagem e fresagem. É ainda necessário o contributo de um operador para efectuar trabalhos manuais, nomeadamente para a passagem de fios e cabos no {{interior}} do módulo. O objectivo desta dissertação passa por projectar um layout optimizado e com elevada flexibilidade para o fabrico de módulos parede. Com estas características procura-se fabricar paredes modulares em tempos reduzidos, com elevada qualidade e produtividade. Ao longo deste trabalho desenvolveram-se duas propostas de células robóticas que satisfazem as condições exigidas. O RobotStudio, para além de ferramenta de desenho, auxiliou na concepção do layout. Permitiu simular e, consequentemente, obter a duração das várias tarefas executadas no fabrico de um módulo parede. Esses tempos foram analisados com recurso a diagramas de Gantt, facultando a visualização das vantagens e inconvenientes de ambos os layouts. Foram comparadas diferentes soluções para diferentes níveis de produção. Para produções até 111 casas/ano foi desenhada uma solução que oferece baixo custo de implementação, utilizando apenas dois equipamentos robotizados. Requer um reabastecimento periódico, que implica a imobilização da célula. Caso se pretenda maior nível de produção terá de recorrer-se a uma segunda opção que consiste numa distribuição em “U”, com recurso a duas passadeiras, e necessita de 5 robôs. O tempo de paragem para reabastecimento é, neste caso, menor. Apesar do investimento inicial ser maior, permite taxas de produção mais elevadas. Abstract A CoolHaven house {{consists of}} standard modules, also designated by walls that allow {{any type of}} construction and {{can be adapted to}} an existing project or a new one according to the customer’s needs and requirements. These modules have optimal dimensions and can have three types: corners, pillars and walls. A wall module consists of four different components: a steel frame that is covered with rockwool and OSB plates on both sides and also an auxiliary wooden structure for the spacing (“slatted”). The assemblage of the walls includes following tasks: riveting and milling. It is still necessary the contribution of an operator to carry out the manual work, in particular fitting the wires and cables inside the module. The {{purpose of this study is}} to design an optimized layout and with high flexibility in the manufacture of wall modules. With these features it is intended to manufacture modular walls in a very short time, with high quality and productivity. Throughout this work were developed two proposals for robotic cells that meet the required conditions. The RobotStudio helped not only as a drawing tool but also in the design of the layout. It allowed the simulation and how to figure out the duration of the various tasks performed in the manufacture of a wall module. The duration was analysed using Gantt diagrams providing a preview of the advantages and disadvantages of both layouts. Different solutions for different production levels were compared. It was designed a solution that offers low cost of implementation just by using two robotics equipments, in order to production 111 houses per year. It requires a periodic refuelling, which implies the immobilization of the cell. For a higher level of production it will have to be applied a second option. It consists of a “U” <b>distribution</b> using two <b>conveyors</b> and five robots. The replenishment time for this case is smaller. Although the initial investment is bigger it allows higher production rates. Colaboração Institucional: SARKKIS – Robotics, Ld...|$|R
