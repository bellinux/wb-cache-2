40|$|The Faculty of Engineering Science at KU Leuven {{has over}} ten years of {{experience}} in letting students develop problem-solving and design competences. Within the learning pathway ‘Problem-Solving and Design’ (PS&D) students collaborate in small groups to solve real-life engineering problems. This pathway consists of four courses that are spread over the three years of the Bachelor’s programme and is based on three Design Pyramids. The central one shows the different aspects of the design process and rests on two smaller pyramids: communication and teamwork {{on the one hand and}} project management on the other (Berbers, Londers, <b>Froyen,</b> Ceusters, De Jong, & Van Hemelrijck, 2015). However, a lack of feedback on the design competences was stated by the students and indicated in quality review reports (de Jong, Londers, Van Hemelrijck, & <b>Froyen,</b> 2014). For this purpose, two steps were taken to make the competences that students develop during PS&D more transparent and develop a tool to assess them. A first step was making the content of each part of the design process explicit, resulting in a table of objectives. Subsequently, rubrics were formulated according to the different components of the Design Pyramids. In this way, students will receive more information than merely a numeric score. The following paper gives an overview of the objectives and reports on the rubrics that were developed. Future plans are also discussed, such as training the coaches of PS&D to guarantee a similar assessment and stimulating the students to use these rubrics during self- and peer-evaluation. status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|According to the {{classical}} mass diffusion of Fick’s law, the concentration gradient is the direct driving force of mass diffusion. Based on the generalized thermoelastic diffusion theory, at the early stage of PECS, the distributions of the temperature and stress fields and of the mass concentration exert an interaction coupling effect at the neck area of particles under transient thermal shock. The influence of temperature gradient and strain are considered in the main concentration diffusion equation. Therefore, the driving forces of mass migration during neck sintering consists of three parts: (1) the neck vacancy concentration gradient affected by intrinsic Laplace stress, additional pressure, and thermal stress (Zhang et al. 2016); (2) the temperature gradient caused by the non-uniform temperature distribution at the neck (Olevsky and <b>Froyen</b> 2009); and (3) the concentration gradient resulting from {{the influence of the}} temperature and stress fields.|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of mutations causing human disease {{has so far}} been biased toward protein-coding regions. Having excluded all annotated coding regions, we performed targeted massively parallel resequencing of the nonrepetitive genomic linkage interval at Xq 28 of family MRX 3. We identified in the binding site of transcription factor YY 1 a regulatory mutation that leads to overexpression of the chromatinassociated transcriptional regulator HCFC 1. When tested on embryonic murine neural stem cells and embryonic hippocampal neurons, HCFC 1 overexpression led to a significant increase of the production of astrocytes and a considerable reduction in neurite growth. Two other nonsynonymous, potentially deleterious changes have been identified by X-exome sequencing in individuals with intellectual disability, implicating HCFC 1 in normal brain function.

Novel PORCN {{mutations}} in focal dermal hypoplasia. Focal dermal hypoplasia (FDH), Goltz or Goltz-Gorlin syndrome, is an X-linked dominant multisystem disorder characterized primarily by {{involvement of the}} skin, skeletal system and eyes. We screened for {{mutations in}} the PORCN gene in eight patients of Belgian and Finnish origin with firm clinical suspicion of FDH. First, we performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis to define the copy number at this locus. Next, we sequenced the coding regions and flanking intronic sequences of the PORCN gene. Three de novo mutations were identified in our patients with FDH: a 150 -kb deletion removing six genes including PORCN, as defined by qPCR and X-array-CGH, and two heterozygous missense mutations; c. 992 T>G (p. L 331 R) in exon 11 and c. 1094 G>A (p. R 365 Q) in exon 13 of the gene. Both point mutations changed highly conserved amino acids and were not found in 300 control X chromosomes. The three patients in whom mutations were identified all present with characteristic dermal findings together with limb manifestations, which were not seen in our mutation-negative patients. The clinical characteristics of our patients with PORCN mutations were compared with the previously reported mutation-positive cases. In this report, we summarize the literature on PORCN mutations and associated phenotypes. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comUsing high resolution X chromosome array-CGH we identified an interstitial microdeletion at Xp 11. 23 in three brothers with moderate to severe mental retardation (MR) without dysmorphic features. The extent of the deletion was subsequently delineated to about 50 kb by regular PCR and included only the SLC 38 A 5 and FTSJ 1 genes. The loss of the FTSJ 1 MR gene in males is expected to result in the observed phenotype but the contribution of the deletion of the solute carrier SLC 38 A 5 gene is less clear. Their mother also carries the deletion and completely inactivates the aberrant X chromosome. Interestingly, the distal breakpoint is situated within a 200 kb SSX repeat region that appears to stimulate recombination since subtle copy number changes often occur at this location and it is frequently involved in translocations in tumours. Since this apparent SSX unstable structure is flanked proximally by FTSJ 1 and PQBP 1, subtle deletions or duplications at this location would be expected to cause MR, as in our family. So far, we have screened a cohort of 300 patients but did not find additional aberrations at the FTSJ 1 locus indicating that the frequency is likely to be low.

We identified a genomic deletion (0. 4 Mb) involving the entire GRIA 3 (encoding iGluR 3) by using an X-array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and four missense variants (G 833 R, M 706 T, R 631 S, and R 450 Q) in functional domains of iGluR 3 by sequencing 400 males with X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). Three variants were found in males with moderate MR and were absent in 500 control males. Expression studies in HEK 293 cells showed that G 833 R resulted in a 78 % reduction of iGluR 3 due to protein misfolding. Whole-cell recording studies of iGluR 3 homomers in HEK 293 cells revealed that neither iGluR 3 -M 706 T (S 2 domain) nor iGluR 3 -R 631 S (near channel core) had substantial channel function, whereas R 450 Q (S 1 domain) was associated with accelerated receptor desensitization. When forming heteromeric receptors with iGluR 2 in HEK 293 cells, all four iGluR 3 variants had altered desensitization kinetics. Our study provides the genetic and functional evidence that mutant iGluR 3 with altered kinetic properties is associated with moderate cognitive impairment in humans. Ye Wua, Amy C.

The rapid {{advancement}} of high-resolution DNA copy number assessment methods revealed the significant contribution of submicroscopic genetic imbalances to abnormal phenotypes, including mental retardation. In order to detect submicroscopic genetic imbalances, we have screened 20 families with X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) using a chromosome X-specific array-MAPH platform with median resolution of 238 kb. Among the 20 families, 18 were experimental, {{as they were}} not previously screened with any microarray method, and two were blind controls with known aberrations, as they were previously screened by array-CGH. This study presents the first clinical application of chromosome X-specific array-MAPH methodology. The screening of 20 affected males from 20 unrelated XLMR families resulted in the detection of an unknown deletion, spanning a region of 7 - 23 kb. Family studies and population screening demonstrated that the detected deletion is an unknown rare copy number variant. One of the control samples, carrying approximately 6 -Mb duplication was correctly identified, moreover it {{was found to be}} interrupted by a previously unknown 19 kb region of normal copy number. The second control 50 kb deletion was not identified, as this particular region was not covered by array-MAPH probes. This study demonstrates that the chromosome X-specific array-MAPH platform is a valuable tool for screening patients with XLMR, or other X-linked disorders, and emerges the need for introducing new high-resolution screening methods for the detection of genetic imbalances.

40|$|In {{the last}} decennium {{learning}} outcomes became {{a key factor}} in quality assurance in higher education in Europe causing an increased interest in methodologies for specifying learning outcomes of a study programme. At the Faculty of Engineering Science, KU Leuven, the ACQA (Academic Competence and Quality Assurance) framework [1] was adopted and implemented. Competence profiles based on ACQA criteria were compiled for all engineering programmes and actively used in accreditation procedures, quality assurance and curriculum development [2]. Despite the proven value of the use of learning outcomes and competence profiles in curriculum development, education developers at the Faculty of Engineering Science felt a need for additional tools to analyse the curriculum with the feeling of ownership as an important additional scope. The use of concepts to analyse the curriculum felt to be very approachable and open to large groups of lecturers. In general, concept mapping is a visual representation of ideas designed to illustrate the relationships between ideas. Previous experiences with concept mapping as a tool for course design proved to be inspiring to elaborate these principles to a curriculum level. In this paper, we will describe the use of concepts and concept mapping as an innovative tool for curriculum development. The use of diverse formats of concept mapping at the Faculty of Engineering Science will be described and discussed in the context of qualitative support in curriculum development.

40|$|The {{computation}} of border-ownership (BOWN) and {{the reconstruction}} of surface structure — i. e., figure/ground assignment and the interpolation of missing contours — are essential puzzles of visual computation, {{in part because they}} epitomize the integration of local and global cues to generate a coherent percept. Here we attempt to integrate two previous computational models and bring them to bear on this problem. In the DISC model of Kogo et al. (2010), BOWN was computed by global iterative interactions of image elements, BOWN signals were considered as a differentiated form of surface representation, and 2 -D integration of BOWN signals (re-) constructed surfaces. Furthermore, the perception of illusory contours and surfaces was modeled by assuming that there are potential BOWN signals at every location in the entire space (free-space BOWNs). In a complementary fashion, <b>Froyen</b> et al. (2010) showed how BOWN can be estimated using Bayesian belief propagation, integrating both local cues (e. g., T-junctions and sign of curvature) and global ones (e. g., skeletal structure) in principled ways. This model included as a nonlocal factor skeletal (medial-axis) structure, under the hypothesis that the medial structure that explains the border best draws its ownership. Here we combine these approaches to yield estimates of surface structure throughout the image, including both the interiors of surfaces as well as all points along the boundaries. We integrate the idea of free-space BOWN to include the computation of illusory contours into the Bayesian framework. Within this dynamic generative model, free-space BOWN signals are estimated by recurrent feedback from higher-level medial structure. Two processes alternate iteratively to estimate local free-space BOWN: (1) skeletal structure is estimated from the BOWN signals and (2) skeletal structure generates new free-space BOWN signals. This process eventually converges onto estimates that are in line with human perception. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|Published in Human Mutation, 2007; 28 (2) : 207 - 208 at www. interscience. wiley. comThe EuroMRX family cohort {{consists}} of about 400 families with non-syndromic and 200 families with syndromic X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). After exclusion of Fragile X (Fra X) syndrome, probands from these families were tested for mutations in the coding sequence of 90 known and candidate XLMR genes. In total, 73 causative mutations {{were identified in}} 21 genes. For 42 % of the families with obligate female carriers, the mental retardation phenotype {{could be explained by}} a mutation. There was no difference between families with (lod score > 2) or without (lod score < 2) significant linkage to the X chromosome. For families with two to five affected brothers (brother pair=BP families) only 17 % of the MR could be explained. This is significantly lower (P= 0. 0067) than in families with obligate carrier females and indicates that the MR in about 40 % (17 / 42) of the BP families is due to a single genetic defect on the X chromosome. The mutation frequency of XLMR genes in BP families is lower than can be expected on basis of the male to female ratio of patients with MR or observed recurrence risks. This might be explained by genetic risk factors on the X chromosome, resulting in a more complex etiology in a substantial portion of XLMR patients. The EuroMRX effort is the first attempt to unravel the molecular basis of cognitive dysfunction by large-scale approaches in a large patient cohort. Our results show that it is now possible to identify 42 % of the genetic defects in non-syndromic and syndromic XLMR families with obligate female carriers. Arjan P. M. de Brouwer, Helger G.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} six publications sought to construct Jewish- American identities for Eastern European Jewish immigrant women between 1895 and 1925, beginning in 1895 with the world's first Jewish women's magazine, American Jewess (1895 - 1899), {{followed by a}} women's magazine in Yiddish, Di froyen-velt (1913 - 1914), and ending with an another Yiddish women's magazine, Der idisher <b>froyen</b> zhurnal (1922 - 1923). Between 1914 and 1916, three mass circulation Yiddish daily newspapers, Dos yidishes tageblatt, Forverts, and Der tog, started printing women's pages. This study ends in 1925, after Congress passed legislation restricting immigration in 1924. These publications present a variety of viewpoints and identities, that were political, religious and class-based. The three magazines, {{all in the same}} genre, held different attitudes on everything from religion to suffrage. The three daily newspapers represented fundamentally different ideologies. Forverts was socialist. Der tog was nationalist-Zionist, and Dos yidishes tageblatt, the oldest publication examined, represented a conservative, traditionally religious viewpoint and supported Zionism. This study examines religious and political ideologies, celebrating religious and civic holidays, attitudes towards women working and learning, Jewish education, women's suffrage and exercising citizenship, as well as women in the public and private spheres of both the Jewish and American worlds. The central question asked is how those involved with these publications endeavored to create particular Jewish-American identities. Not being a reader- response study, I make no assumptions as to these publications' actual influence. The press represented only one institution involved in acculturation. Issues subsumed under the central question include how producers of these publications perceived Americanization and saw Jews in America; and what changes these journals advocated regarding religious practices, gender roles, and citizenship. "Acculturation" implies negotiation in the process of identity formation, as a blending of Old and New World customs, lifestyles, mores, economic and social conditions occurred. This dissertation takes a social constructionist view of ethnicity and identity formation. Based on translations relevant pieces from all issues of the publications under review, this study points to the diversity present on the American "Jewish Street" from 1895 to 1925...|$|E
