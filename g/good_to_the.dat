This results in a much smoother flow of trade, and has allowed shipping lines to move towards electronic data interchange which may greatly ease the flow of global trade.|$|R

25|$|A minor alternative, {{especially}} for information goods, {{is for the}} producer to refuse to release a <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public until payment to cover costs is met. Author Stephen King, for instance, authored chapters of a new novel downloadable for free on his website while stating {{that he would not}} release subsequent chapters unless {{a certain amount of money}} was raised. Sometimes dubbed holding for ransom, this method of public goods production is a modern application of the street performer protocol for public goods production. Unlike assurance contracts, its success relies largely on social norms to ensure (to some extent) that the threshold is reached and partial contributions are not wasted.|$|E
25|$|While Russell wrote a {{great deal}} on ethical subject matters, he did not believe that the subject belonged to {{philosophy}} or that when he wrote on ethics that he did so in his capacity as a philosopher. In his earlier years, Russell was greatly influenced by G.E. Moore's Principia Ethica. Along with Moore, he then believed that moral facts were objective, but known only through intuition; that they were simple properties of objects, not equivalent (e.g., pleasure is <b>good)</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> natural objects to which they are often ascribed (see Naturalistic fallacy); and that these simple, undefinable moral properties cannot be analysed using the non-moral properties with which they are associated. In time, however, he came to agree with his philosophical hero, David Hume, who believed that ethical terms dealt with subjective values that cannot be verified {{in the same way as}} matters of fact.|$|E
25|$|Trade {{built up}} steadily, {{although}} not quite at {{quickly as the}} company had estimated. Tolls produced £2,614 in the year to April 1798. During that year, a packet boat began running between Nottingham and Cromford, and in 1798, a second boat provided a service between Nottingham and Leicester. Income from tolls increased to £4,647 in 1799/1800. Most of the traffic was coal, amounting to 89,500 tons {{out of a total}} of 114,227 tons carried. Co-operation between the Cromford Canal and the Nottingham Canal was <b>good,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> benefit of both companies. A brief attempt to poach traffic from the Erewash Canal in 1797 by undercutting their rates was a financial disaster, leading to an agreement to charge the authorised tolls for goods on both canals, and not to try to entice customers from each other. Once the mortgage was redeemed in 1804, the company agreed to pay dividends to the shareholders, at a rate of £12 per £150 share. These were paid twice a year, but from time to time a third payment was made, to reduce the backlog of payments, which were nine years in arrears on the date when the first payment was made. By 1830, tolls raised £9,879, and in 1840, this had risen to £12,825.|$|E

500|$|When {{developing}} Smallville {{version of}} Clark Kent, the producers decided to strip {{him down to}} the [...] "bare essence" [...] of Superman; he is also fallible, which allows the audience to see his humanity, but that he is also [...] "... <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> core". In the series, he has been seen by critics, and intentionally portrayed by the filmmakers, as a symbolic representation of Jesus Christ.

500|$|In November, Ljotić intervened {{on behalf}} of 300–500 men {{detained}} by the Germans as suspected Freemasons.

According to his personal secretary, Ljotić also asked Turner to not order the killing of Jews, stating [...] " [...] against Jews ruling my country's economy, but I am against their murder." [...] He added that [...] "their innocently-spilled blood cannot bring any <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> people who do this."

500|$|Even though Clark {{could make}} the wrong choices, season five's [...] "Aqua" [...] helped {{illustrate}} the concept that Clark was [...] "... <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> core".

In this case, {{he was trying to}} warn Lois that Arthur Curry {{may not have been the}} man she believed him to be. This concept was echoed by the Seattle Times Julia Waterhous, who noted that Clark, despite all his flaws, always put others before himself. Welling's fellow actors also had their own insights into the character. Kristin Kreuk saw Clark as a kindred spirit who was sad, lonely, but also endearing; whereas John Schneider classified Clark as a special needs child.|$|E

500|$|... 5to Piso (Quinto Piso, 5th Floor) is the {{eleventh}} studio album by Guatemalan singer-songwriter Ricardo Arjona, released on 18 November 2008. Produced by Arjona, Jorge Amaro, Dan Warner, Lee Levin, Fernando de Santiago and Puerto Rican singer-songwriter Tommy Torres, {{the album was}} recorded in various studios between the United States and Mexico. It is the first release by the artist under Warner Music. Arjona commented that with this album, he [...] "tried to recoup some of the freshness" [...] of his past releases, stating that [...] "it makes <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> songs". Jason Birchmeier from Allmusic named it [...] "an eagerly awaited album with a phenomenal lead single."

The paper believed that the game would [...] "set a new standard for computer games with its combination of action and puzzle-solving". The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said that the game [...] "is like a well-prepared hamburger—familiar stuff, but <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> last byte". The reviewer noted the game's [...] "somewhat clumsy control", but said, [...] "That, however, is all I can find to complain about.

Although intended as a demo recording, the end result sounded so <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> band and Johns, they decided to use it as the final take. Overdubs, including an acoustic guitar part played by Townshend, were recorded at Olympic Studios at the end of April. The track was mixed at Island Studios by Johns on 28 May. After Lifehouse was abandoned as a project, Johns felt [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again", along with other songs, were so good that they could simply be released as a standalone single album, which became Who's Next.|$|E
