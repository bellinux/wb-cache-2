Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E

Dixon was at first hesitant to join, fearing that snobbery within the music industry would damage her career. In a later interview, she said, [...] "there's always this preconceived idea that people do reality TV shows {{because they want to}} kick-start their careers whereas <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> worried that it would affect it." [...] They had been the favourite from the third week, receiving the most points from the judges on numerous occasions.

[...] After completing [...] "Objection (Tango)", Shakira decided to write ten more songs and began setting up portable recording studios in the rural region of Uruguay.

[...] During the songwriting process, Shakira wrote [...] "Underneath Your Clothes" [...] as a love song for de la Rúa.

500|$|At {{the time}} of its release, [...] "I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time" [...] was the subject of {{controversy}} with the Asian community, as well as comedian Margaret Cho. In the film Full Metal Jacket, an Asian prostitute approaches US troops and offers to engage in lewd conduct in exchange for money. She uses terms such as [...] "Me so horny" [...] and [...] "me love you long time", which were heavily parodied and popularized. Accordingly, those terms have been used as humor at the expense of Asian people, and have been described as [...] "racial slurs" [...] by Cho. Other female acts have been known to use the phrase, such as Fergie on her track [...] "London Bridge" [...] (2006), and Nelly Furtado in [...] "Maneater" [...] (2006). In an interview with MTV News, Cho retracted her earlier comments, and expressed how if used in song, and by a female then it wouldn't be offensive: [...] "I don't mind it when it's used in songs, like when women use it," [...] Cho continued. [...] "Fergie uses it, that doesn't bother me. But when it's shouted in the street and they don't wait to hear the response? What if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> going to go, 'Oh, OK'?

[...] Keys said that while {{recording}} the song she wanted to make sure she got the hook right explaining, [...] "I did try it a couple of times, but it was more about capturing the kind of grand feeling of it. With the way I sang it the first time, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> kind of sick, and I knew that he needed the record, so I was like, 'Let me get to it.'" [...] She added, [...] "I came back and revisited it so that it could be what it is now So it actually took a couple of times, but every time, the energy was just so high." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly felt that the singer who sings the song's hook has a [...] "crucial role", believing that [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] is a [...] "smash that concert attendees expect Jay to play, and it just wouldn't work without a big, clear voice to sing that hook". In November 2012, Keys said she had to redo the vocals after Jay-Z said he wasn't happy with her original take. Keys said she had been battling [...] "nasal congestion" [...] when she did the first take.|$|E
500|$|In two {{separate}} 2016 AMAs on Reddit, both Nick Jonas and Joe Jonas {{reflected on the}} episode.

[...] "But years later and once the purity rings were no longer around, it was very funny to me and I've actually watched the episode a few times." [...] "I loved it. When it first came out I was so pumped". Joe said. [...] "I know that Nick was really kind of not into watching it, but I {{thought it was the}} funniest thing at the time and it's kind of a compliment because obviously {{if you go to a}} comedy show and they pick you out and make fun of you, you can't heckle back, you gotta just take it and enjoy it, and for me I've always been a fan and I knew that was kind of a wow we made it moment, and also they were kind of attacking Disney more than me, so I didn't really feel threatened.

His {{performance}} garnered standing ovation from the audience {{as well as the}} four judges. Parke also recorded the song and included it in his debut album, Ronan Parke. In an interview with Digital Spy, Parke stated that it was really challenging to record [...] "Because of You." [...] He added, [...] "I asked the producer if we could leave out some of the big notes. We left them until the end and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> a bit scared by the noise that came out of me - I didn't know I could sound that loud!" [...] "Because of You" [...] was also covered by Kim Bo Kyung, who was a contestant in South Korean singing competition show, Superstar K2. Her performance received positive response from the judges and was considered as one of the highlights in the show even though she failed to advance into the Top 11. Following her elimination, she recorded the studio version of [...] "Because of You" [...] which was released as a digital download by Sony Music Entertainment due to an overwhelming demand. She also received a personal video message from Clarkson who gave her words of advice and support. The song also was covered by Orange Caramel, a South Korean girl group, on Christmas Day for MBC's special programme, [...] "ICON". Besides these cover versions, [...] "Because of You" [...] was also included in international soundtrack to Brazilian soap opera Belíssima.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} {{team for}} Mega Man consisted of only six people. Inafune (credited as [...] "Inafuking") designed and illustrated {{nearly all of}} the game's characters and enemies, as well as the Japanese Rockman logo, box art, and instruction manual. He was also responsible for rendering these designs into graphical sprite form. [...] "We didn’t have [...] people, so after drawing character designs, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> doing the dotting (pixelation) for the Nintendo," [...] Inafune stated. [...] "Back then, people weren’t specialized and we had {{to do a lot of}} different things because there was so few people, so I really ended up doing all the characters." [...] Inafune was influenced by the eponymous protagonist of Osamu Tezuka's manga Astro Boy in his Mega Man designs. Mega Man is colored blue due to the NES console's technical limitations: the color has the most shades in the console's limited 56-color palette, and the expanded selection was used to enhance Mega Man's detail. Although he is often credited for designing the character, Inafune insists that he [...] "only did half of the job in creating him", as his mentor developed the basic character concept before Inafune's arrival. The basic sprites for Roll and Dr. Light were created before Inafune joined the project, and the designs for Cut Man, Ice Man, Fire Man, and Guts Man were in process. Aside from normal enemies, Inafune's first character was Elec Man, inspired by American comic book characters. The artist has commented that Elec Man has always been his favorite design. The designs for Dr. Light and Dr. Wily were based on Santa Claus and Albert Einstein, respectively; the latter character was meant to represent an archetypal [...] "mad scientist".|$|E
500|$|Clarkson co-wrote {{the seventh}} track, [...] "Where Is Your Heart", with DioGuardi and Chantal Kreviazuk. She {{revealed}} {{that it was}} also about her boyfriend, Hodges, whom she described as [...] "wanting to get really into our relationship, and I just thought, 'Where are you in our relationship?'" [...] "Walk Away", the eight track, was also written by the three, with additional writing by Raine Maida. Clarkson described it as [...] "one of the brighter songs" [...] on Breakaway, and said that [...] "It's very blunt and to the point. 'I'm done with you, you're upsetting me.'" [...] DioGuardi and Shanks co-wrote the ninth track, [...] "You Found Me". Clarkson revealed, [...] "When I recorded this one, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> in a good place with a guy. It was very fitting {{at the time that}} I recorded it." [...] DioGuardi had also co-written the tenth track, [...] "I Hate Myself for Losing You", with Jimmy Harry and Shep Solomon. Clarkson described the song as [...] "depressing", but felt it {{could be used as a}} foreshadowing device. She explained [...] "I read something that Sting said in an interview, he talked about how the great thing about writing is that it is an emotional and therapeutic thing and you can get it out." [...] The eleventh track, [...] "Hear Me", was written by Clarkson, DioGuardi, and Clif Magness. Clarkson explained the song, [...] "It's is almost like a prayer to God. I haven't met the person whom I will spend the rest of my life with, but the song is a prayer to God about that. That's what the song is. 'God, I'm ready for 'the one!'" [...] The twelfth and closing track is a live recording of [...] "Beautiful Disaster", originally from Thankful. Clarkson admitted that she hated Thankfuls version of the song, and thought the production was distracting from the lyrics. So she decided to record a piano ballad version instead.|$|E
