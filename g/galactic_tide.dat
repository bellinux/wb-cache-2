5|$|Most of {{the comets}} seen {{close to the}} Sun seem to have reached their current {{positions}} through gravitational perturbation of the Oort cloud by the tidal force exerted by the Milky Way. Just as the Moon's tidal force deforms Earth's oceans, causing the tides to rise and fall, the <b>galactic</b> <b>tide</b> also distorts the orbits of bodies in the outer Solar System. In the charted regions of the Solar System, these effects are negligible compared to {{the gravity of the}} Sun, but in the outer reaches of the system, the Sun's gravity is weaker and the gradient of the Milky Way's gravitational field has substantial effects. Galactic tidal forces stretch the cloud along an axis directed toward the galactic centre and compress it along the other two axes; these small perturbations can shift orbits in the Oort cloud to bring objects close to the Sun. The point at which the Sun's gravity concedes its influence to the <b>galactic</b> <b>tide</b> is called the tidal truncation radius. It lies at a radius of 100,000 to 200,000 AU, and marks the outer boundary of the Oort cloud.|$|E
5|$|The Oort cloud is a {{hypothetical}} spherical cloud {{of up to}} a trillion icy objects that {{is thought to be}} the source for all long-period comets and to surround the Solar System at roughly 50,000AU (around 1light-year (ly)), and possibly to as far as 100,000AU (1.87ly). It is thought to be composed of comets that were ejected from the inner Solar System by gravitational interactions with the outer planets. Oort cloud objects move very slowly, and can be perturbed by infrequent events, such as collisions, the gravitational effects of a passing star, or the <b>galactic</b> <b>tide,</b> the tidal force exerted by the Milky Way.|$|E

5|$|A {{somewhat}} similar hypothesis was advanced by astronomer John J. Matese of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in 2002. He contends that more comets are {{arriving in the}} inner Solar System from a particular region of the postulated Oort cloud than {{can be explained by}} the <b>galactic</b> <b>tide</b> or stellar perturbations alone, and that the most likely cause would be a Jupiter-mass object in a distant orbit. This hypothetical gas giant was nicknamed Tyche. The WISE mission, an all-sky survey using parallax measurements in order to clarify local star distances, was capable of proving or disproving the Tyche hypothesis. In 2014, NASA announced that the WISE survey had ruled out any object as they had defined it.|$|E
5|$|Besides the <b>galactic</b> <b>tide,</b> {{the main}} trigger for sending comets {{into the inner}} Solar System {{is thought to be}} {{interaction}} between the Sun's Oort cloud and the gravitational fields of nearby stars or giant molecular clouds. The orbit of the Sun through the plane of the Milky Way sometimes brings it in relatively close proximity to other stellar systems. For example, it is hypothesized that 70thousand years ago, perhaps Scholz's star passed through the outer Oort cloud (although its low mass and high relative velocity limited its effect). During the next 10million years the known star with the greatest possibility of perturbing the Oort cloud is Gliese 710. This process could also scatter Oort cloud objects out of the ecliptic plane, potentially also explaining its spherical distribution.|$|E
5|$|Comets {{usually have}} highly {{eccentric}} elliptical orbits, {{and they have}} a wide range of orbital periods, ranging from several years to potentially several millions of years. Short-period comets originate in the Kuiper belt or its associated scattered disc, which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune. Long-period comets are thought to originate in the Oort cloud, a spherical cloud of icy bodies extending from outside the Kuiper belt to halfway to the nearest star. Long-period comets are set in motion towards the Sun from the Oort cloud by gravitational perturbations caused by passing stars and the <b>galactic</b> <b>tide.</b> Hyperbolic comets may pass once through the inner Solar System before being flung to interstellar space. The appearance of a comet is called an apparition.|$|E

500|$|Various {{scientists}} {{have speculated that}} the Solar System's path through the galaxy {{is a factor in}} the periodicity of mass extinctions observed in the Earth's fossil record. One hypothesis supposes that vertical oscillations made by the Sun as it orbits the Galactic Centre cause it to regularly pass through the galactic plane.

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of passing field stars on the angular {{momentum}} of a nearly radial orbit of an Oort cloud comet bound to the Sun. We derive the probability density function (PDF) of the change in angular momentum from one stellar encounter, assuming a uniform and isotropic field of perturbers. We show that the total angular momentum follows a Levy flight, and determine its distribution function. If there is an asymmetry in the directional distribution of perturber velocities, the marginal probability distribution of each component of the angular momentum vector can be different. The constant torque attributed to <b>Galactic</b> <b>tides</b> arises from a non-cancellation of perturbations with an impact parameter of order the semimajor axis of the comet. When the close encounters are rare, the angular momentum is best modeled by the stochastic growth of stellar encounters. If trajectories passing between the comet and sun occur frequently, the angular momentum exhibits the coherent growth attributed to the <b>Galactic</b> <b>tides.</b> Comment: 8 pages, 2 figures; accepted to A...|$|R
50|$|The <b>galactic</b> <b>tide's</b> {{effect is}} {{negligible}} on Earth, though could in theory {{be measured by}} sea level changes like other tides: If the sun's tidal effect is 1, then the Moon's is 2 and the Milky Way's is about 10−12.

500|$|Some {{believers in}} a 2012 doomsday {{used the term}} [...] "galactic alignment" [...] to {{describe}} a different phenomenon proposed by some scientists to explain a pattern in mass extinctions supposedly observed in the fossil record. According to the Shiva Hypothesis, mass extinctions are not random, but recur every 26 million years. To account for this, {{it was suggested that}} vertical oscillations made by the Sun on its 250-million-year orbit of the galactic center cause it to regularly pass through the galactic plane.

50|$|The Oort cloud is {{believed}} to be a vast shell surrounding the Solar System, possibly over a light-year in radius. Across such a vast distance, the gradient of the Milky Way's gravitational field plays a far more noticeable role.

50|$|There {{are many}} dwarf {{galaxies in the}} Local Group; these small galaxies {{frequently}} orbit larger galaxies, such as the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy and the Triangulum Galaxy.

50|$|Tidal {{effects are}} also present within a galaxy, where their {{gradients}} {{are likely to}} be steepest. This can have consequences for the formation of stars and planetary systems. Typically a star's gravity will dominate within its own system, with only the passage of other stars substantially affecting dynamics. However, at the outer reaches of the system, the star's gravity is weak and <b>galactic</b> <b>tides</b> may be significant.

50|$|Some of {{the objects}} {{scattered}} onto very distant orbits during the giant planet migration are captured in the Oort cloud. The outer Oort cloud, semi-major axes greater than 20,000 AU, forms quickly as the <b>galactic</b> <b>tide</b> raises the perihelion of object beyond the orbits of the giant planets. The inner Oort cloud forms more slowly, from the outside in, due to the weaker effect of the <b>galactic</b> <b>tide</b> on objects with smaller semi-major axes. Most objects captured in the outer Oort cloud are scattered outward by Saturn, without encountering Jupiter, with some being scattered outward by Uranus and Neptune. Those captured in the inner Oort cloud are primarily scattered outward by Neptune. Roughly 6.5% of the planetesimals beyond Neptune's initial orbit, approximately 1.3 Earth masses, are captured in the Oort cloud with roughly 60% in the inner cloud.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of their size evolution in understanding the dynamical evolution of globular clusters (GCs) of the Milky Way, studies are rare that focus specifically on this issue. Based on the advanced, realistic Fokker-Planck (FP) approach, we predict theoretically the initial size distribution (SD) of the Galactic GCs along with their initial mass function and radial distribution. Over one thousand FP calculations in a wide parameter space have pinpointed the best-fit initial conditions for the SD, mass function, and radial distribution. Our best-fit model shows that the initial SD of the Galactic GCs is of larger dispersion than today's SD, and that typical projected half-light radius of the initial GCs is ~ 4. 6 pc, which is 1. 8 times larger than that of the present-day GCs (~ 2. 5 pc). Their large size signifies greater susceptibility to the Galactic tides: the total mass of destroyed GCs reaches 3 - 5 x 10 ^ 8 M_sun$, several times larger than the previous estimates. Our result challenges a recent view that the Milky Way GCs were born compact on the sub-pc scale, and rather implies that (1) the initial GCs are generally larger than the typical size of the present-day GCs, (2) the initially large GCs mostly shrink and/or disrupt {{as a result of the}} <b>galactic</b> <b>tides,</b> and (3) the initially small GCs expand by two-body relaxation, and later shrink by the <b>galactic</b> <b>tides.</b> Comment: 9 pages, 8 figures, 2 table...|$|R

40|$|Milgromian {{dynamics}} (MD or MOND) is {{a promising}} physical description excelling especially in galaxies. When formulated as a modified gravity theory, {{it leads to}} the so called external field effect (EFE). In {{the case of the}} solar system this means that bodies orbiting the Sun are influenced, beyond its tidal effect, by the external gravitational field of the Galaxy with magnitude ∼ 2 × 10 ^- 10 m s^- 2 and time-varying direction. Aphelia of intermediate outer Oort cloud (OC) comets (30 <X< 60, X≡ 10 ^ 6 /a[au], where a is semimajor axis) are distributed non-uniformly on the celestial sphere, showing an apparent concentration around a great circle centered at Galactic longitudes L=- 45 and 135 deg. Such non-uniformity is beyond that attributable to the classical injectors of comets, stellar encounters and the <b>Galactic</b> <b>tides,</b> as well as the expected observational biases. We investigated a hypothesis that the great circle concentration of aphelia is a consequence of the long-term action of EFE in the framework of MD. We considered exclusively quasi-linear MOND (QUMOND) theory. We built our model of the OC in MD on an analytical approximation of the QUMOND potential for a point mass in the dominant external field of constant magnitude. The model is well applicable at heliocentric distances r≳ 10 000 au. Constraints on the strength of EFE found by the analysis of the Cassini radio-tracking data were taken into account. We demonstrated characteristic imprint of the EFE on the distribution of aphelia of candidate outer OC comets that migrated down to r= 10 000 au. By both analytical and numerical calculations, we showed that the combined effect of EFE and the <b>Galactic</b> <b>tides</b> could qualitatively account for the characteristic features seen in the observed distribution of aphelia of the outer OC comets.
