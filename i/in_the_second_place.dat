5|$|The {{greater number}} of naturalists who have taken into {{consideration}} the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed Blumenbach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate Order, under {{the title of the}} Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by Bischoff, Aeby, and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>place,</b> we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head. I absolutely know of none. If only someone might tell me a single one! If I would have called man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the theologians against me. Perhaps I ought to have by virtue of the law of the discipline.|$|E

25|$|In {{at least}} two senses, the rapid {{expansion}} of Tambralinga is exceptional in the history of Southeast Asia.

Tambralinga’s sudden appearance on centre-stage in the thirteenth century was thus highly unusual.|$|E

25|$|The formal {{cause is}} its form, i.e., the {{arrangement}} of that matter. It tells us what a thing is, that any thing {{is determined by the}} definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation. Plainly put, the formal cause is the idea existing in the first place as exemplar {{in the mind of the}} sculptor, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>place</b> as intrinsic, determining cause, embodied in the matter. Formal cause could only refer to the essential quality of causation.

With eight laps remaining, Rosberg was able to take over Räikkönen for second. Grosjean then caught up with Räikkönen on the fourth last lap, but was not immediately able to pass him. At this point, the Lotus trackside operations director Alan Permane had a heated radio exchange with Räikkönen, commanding him {{to move out of the}} way. The radio conversation was widely noted in the press, raising questions about the health of his relationship with the team. Räikkönen eventually finished 7th after stopping for new tyres with only two laps to go.|$|E

According to the principle of assistance and the accomplishment of the administrative police tasks, the need implied by these functions are satisfied.

25|$|For {{the second}} year in a row, Räikkönen had to retire from the first race of the season in Australia, after a fire broke out in his airbox. Räikkönen {{finished}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>place</b> at the Bahrain Grand Prix while his teammate Sebastian Vettel did not start the race after his car broke down on formation lap. Räikkönen outpaced teammate Sebastian Vettel in qualifying at the Chinese Grand Prix to take 3rd on the grid, however a first lap collision with Vettel saw him damaging his front wing and he dropped down the order, he then showed good pace to move up the field and eventually finished fifth. He managed to finish the Russian Grand Prix in third place after a huge start collision, which left his teammate Vettel out of the race. This was also the 700th podium in Ferrari's Formula One history. Räikkönen finished behind Max Verstappen in second place to take his third podium of the season in the Spanish Grand Prix finishing ahead of his teammate Vettel who was third.|$|E
25|$|Such of Boileau's early poems as {{have been}} {{preserved}} hardly contain {{the promise of}} what he ultimately became. The first piece in which his peculiar powers were displayed was the first satire (1660), in imitation of the third satire of Juvenal; it embodied the farewell of a poet {{to the city of}} Paris. This was quickly followed by eight others, and the number was at a later period increased to twelve. A twofold interest attaches to the satires. In the first place the author skilfully parodies and attacks writers who at the time were placed in the very first rank, such as Jean Chapelain, the abbé Charles Cotin, Philippe Quinault and Georges de Scudéry; he openly raised the standard of revolt against the older poets. But <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>place</b> he showed both by precept and practice what were the poetical capabilities of the French language. Prose in the hands of such writers as René Descartes and Blaise Pascal had proved itself a flexible and powerful instrument of expression, with a distinct mechanism and form. But except with Francois de Malherbe, there had been no attempt to fashion French versification according to rule or method. In Boileau for the first time appeared terseness and vigour of expression, with perfect regularity of verse structure.|$|E

He {{considered}} {{making the}} former but {{was worried about}} similarities between the story and The Seventh Seal (1957), so he decided on adapting the latter. However Samuel Z. Arkoff said it was his and James H. Nicholson's decision to make Pit as the second Poe film [...] "because {{it was a lot}} more graphic and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>place,</b> Masque of the Red Death would have needed a dancing troupe that would have been quite expensive.

500|$|In 1817, the deplorable {{state of}} the War Department led four men to decline offers from President James Monroe to accept the office of Secretary of War before Calhoun finally assumed the role.

He proposed an elaborate program of national reforms to the infrastructure that he believed would speed economic modernization.

500|$|The new {{magazine}} was titled Venture Science Fiction, {{and the first}} issue was dated January 1957. Mills was managing editor of F throughout Ventures first run; he became editor of F shortly after Venture ceased publishing in July 1958. The editorial philosophy was laid out by Ferman in the inaugural issue: [...] "strong stories of action and adventure... There will be two prime requisites for Venture stories: In the first place, each must be a well-told story, with a beginning, middle and end; <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>place,</b> each must be a strong story—a story with pace, power and excitement." [...] Ferman hoped {{to take advantage of}} a gap in the science fiction magazine market opened up by the demise of Planet Stories, one of the last sf pulps, which had ceased publication in late 1955. [...] Planet Stories had focused on adventure stories, as opposed to the realistic style becoming more popular in science fiction in the 1950s, and Ferman hoped to combine the virtues of the melodramatic pulp fiction style with the literary values that were key to Fs success. [...] Ventures bias towards action-oriented adventure led to stories with relatively more sex and violence than those in competing magazines, and sf historian Mike Ashley has commented that it was perhaps five or ten years ahead of its time. [...] One story, [...] "The Girl Had Guts", by Theodore Sturgeon, involved an alien virus that caused its victims to vomit up their intestines; Ashley records a reviewer saying that the story made him physically ill.|$|E
