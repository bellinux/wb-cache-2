25|$|About a year later, Archibald has {{returned}} to Cruden Bay and is preparing a permanent residence there. He buys a trunk from an auctioneer on the street (where he again encounters Gormala) and finds that the trunk contains letters from the late 16th and early 17th centuries. While near the seashore, Archibald notices two ladies stranded on a rock out in the ocean. He helps them get back to shore, and learns {{that one of the}} ladies is an elderly woman named Mrs. Jack, and the other a young, beautiful woman named Marjory, an American who has a strong aversion to Spaniards. Archibald feels himself falling in love with Marjory instantly. Later, Marjory helps Archibald decode the letters that he found in the trunk, which are written in a complicated cipher (Bacon's cipher). Archibald soon proposes marriage to Marjory, but she declines with the excuse that she does not <b>know</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> enough.|$|E
25|$|At the Manor Christmas party, Will {{once again}} sees Dawson and Old George {{who seem to}} <b>know</b> <b>him</b> <b>well.</b> Miss Greythorne and Merriman debate about {{when and how to}} {{approach}} Will about his destiny. Maggie Barnes (Amelia Warner), an attractive local girl appears at the party and Will becomes upset when one of his older brothers approaches her and begins chatting to her. Will leaves the Manor, and an ominous figure mounted on a white horse and accompanied by dogs chases Will. As the ominous figure prepares to kill Will, who is currently no match for him, Miss Greythorne, Merriman, Dawson, and Old George suddenly appear and save Will. Merriman names the threatening figure as The Rider (Christopher Eccleston), who warns them all that in five days' time his power – The Dark – will rise. The four adults are the last of the Old Ones – ancient warriors who serve The Light – and take Will on a walk through time and space to a place called the Great Hall, which in the present day is the church the Stantons attend. Will is the last of the Old Ones to have been born: he is the seventh son of a seventh son whose power begins to ascend on his fourteenth birthday, though Will disputes this idea because he believes he is the sixth son. Will is The Seeker: the sign-seeker who must locate six Signs whose possession will grant The Light power over The Dark. The Rider is also seeking them. Will returns home to his attic room and falls and twists his ankle. The doctor who calls is The Rider in disguise but he is recognized by Will. The Rider demonstrates his powers on Will’s ankle by alternately healing it and making it much worse before restoring it to its injured state; he offers Will the chance to have any desire he wants fulfilled in exchange for giving him the signs. Will discovers he has a lost twin brother named Tom, who, as a baby, mysteriously disappeared one night and was never found. Merriman instructs Will on his powers, which include sensing the Signs, summoning superhuman strength, commanding light and fire, telekinesis, stepping through time, and the unique knowledge to decipher an ancient text in the Book of Gramarye. Unfortunately, Will learns he can't fly, a power he wanted.|$|E

500|$|Henry married Louise de Lorraine-Vaudémont in February 1575, {{two days}} after his coronation. His choice thwarted Catherine's plans for a {{political}} marriage to a foreign princess. Rumours of Henry's inability to produce children were by that time in wide circulation. The papal nuncio Salviati observed, [...] "it is only with difficulty that we can imagine there will be offspring... physicians and those who <b>know</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> {{say that he has}} an extremely weak constitution and will not live long." [...] As time passed and the likelihood of children from the marriage receded, Catherine's youngest son, Francis, Duke of Alençon, known as [...] "Monsieur", played upon his role as heir to the throne, repeatedly exploiting the anarchy of the civil wars, which were by now as much about noble power struggles as religion. Catherine did all in her power to bring Francis back into the fold. On one occasion, in March 1578, she lectured him for six hours about his dangerously subversive behaviour.|$|E
500|$|Paul Nobuo Tatsuguchi {{graduated}} from {{middle school in}} Hiroshima on March 16, 1919. [...] On March 2, 1923, he {{graduated from}} Travier English Academy. [...] Paul traveled to California and entered Pacific Union College in 1926 and graduated in May 1932. [...] When his parents both died unexpectedly in 1932, Paul returned to Japan to help settle the family affairs. [...] He returned to California in 1933 and entered the College of Medical Evangelists at Loma Linda University, completing the course of study in June 1937. [...] Paul Tatsuguchi then accepted a year's internship at White Memorial Hospital in Los Angeles. [...] While studying in America, Tatsuguchi was regarded by his classmates, who called him [...] "Tatsy" [...] or Paul, as a serious student, friendly but not gregarious. [...] Classmate J. Mudry, a year behind Tatsuguchi at Loma Linda University, later said, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>him</b> <b>well.</b> [...] I always thought Tatsuguchi—we called him Paul—was quite an American." ...|$|E
500|$|Hanna made speeches {{across the}} state, {{much to the}} curiosity of Ohioans, who had heard {{a great deal about}} him for his {{activities}} on behalf of McKinley, but who did not <b>know</b> <b>him</b> <b>well.</b> [...] He had rarely been called upon to make public addresses. [...] McKinley recommended his personal technique of thoroughly laying out a speech in advance, but Hanna found it did not work well for him. [...] Instead, he preferred to compose a brief introduction and then speak extemporaneously, not always even being certain of what topics he would address. [...] According to his biographer, Herbert Croly, the informality of Hanna's speeches won over many in his audience, and he became known as a very effective public speaker. [...] According to Philip Warken in his thesis on the 1898 Senate election, [...] "The campaign probably worked to Hanna's advantage. [...] The shadowy figure in the background took on shape and form, the candidate's public appearances tending to break down [...] popular but distorted image of him." [...] When Democrats attacked Hanna, who had considerable financial interests in industry, as a [...] "labor crusher", he gave speeches inviting listeners to ask his workers whether they were well treated. [...] Subsequently, several union leaders and workmen's committees confirmed that they had no complaint against Hanna.|$|E

2500|$|Bunin {{has often}} been spoken of as a [...] "cold" [...] writer. Some of his {{conceptual}} poems of the 1910s refuted this stereotype, tackling philosophical issues like the mission of an artist ("Insensory", 1916) where he showed fiery passion. According to Oleg Mikhaylov, [...] "Bunin wanted to maintain distance between himself and his reader, being frightened by any closeness... But his pride never excluded passions, just served as a panzer— {{it was like a}} flaming torch in an icy shell." [...] On a more personal level, Vera Muromtseva confirmed: [...] "Sure, he wanted to come across as [...] and he succeeded by being a first-class actor... people who didn't <b>know</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> enough couldn't begin to imagine what depths of soft tenderness his soul was capable of reaching," [...] she wrote in her memoirs.|$|E

His father, Zhang Yun (張允), was famous in Wu Commandery for valuing {{friendship}} and having a low regard for material wealth. Zhang Yun also served as an Official in the East Bureau (東曹掾) under the warlord Sun Quan, who became the founding emperor of Eastern Wu later. At a young age, Zhang Wen was already known for his good moral conduct and for having a dignified appearance. When Sun Quan heard about him, he asked his subjects, [...] "As of now, who is Zhang Wen comparable to?" [...] Liu Ji, the Grand Prefect of Agriculture (大農令), said, [...] "He is comparable to Quan Cong." [...] However, Gu Yong, the Minister of Ceremonies (太常), had a different opinion, [...] "Liu Ji doesn't <b>know</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> enough. No one is comparable to Zhang Wen as of now." [...] Sun Quan said, [...] "If it is so, Zhang Yun must be still alive." [...] When Zhang Wen was summoned to the Wu court to meet Sun Quan and his subjects, he impressed them with his demeanour and his eloquent responses to their questions. As {{he was about to}} leave, Zhang Zhao held his hand and said, [...] "I entrust my plans to you. You should understand what I mean." [...] Zhang Wen was then appointed as a Consultant (議郎) and Master of Writing in the Selection Bureau (選曹尚書). He was promoted to Crown Prince's Tutor (太子太傅) later and was highly regarded by Sun Quan.|$|E
