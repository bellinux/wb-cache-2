3000|$|Two {{specimens}} {{are used}} to generate partial discharges, a <b>generator</b> <b>bar</b> and a Tesla-coil [16]. For the <b>generator</b> <b>bar,</b> a copper conductor is coated with epoxy-micarta insulation with a shield covers the insulation {{in the middle of}} the bar. This specimen can be considered as an unsheathed coaxial cable: The central conductor is linked to a high-voltage source, and the shield is grounded. The Tesla-coil is a tool used to ionize plasma. It delivers a high voltage (54 kV). The same measurement setup is used for the two specimens. A wideband antenna is linked to the TDS 6124 C digital oscilloscope, which is set with a sampling frequency twice larger than the maximum frequency of the antenna. For example, 2.5 GS/s sampling frequency is used when the biconical antenna (30 - 300 MHz) is used, and 10 GS/s is used for the Wi-Fi antenna (2.4 GHz, 2 dBi). The step-by-step procedure for the measurements is described as follows: [...]...|$|E
30|$|With the <b>generator</b> <b>bar,</b> it was {{observed}} in the laboratory that the voltage used to feed the specimen {{has an influence on}} the partial discharge magnitude. The phenomenon has already been studied for different high-voltage substations [2, 3, 18]. For example, the power line with the highest voltage gives the more significant corona noise according to Pakala works. So it is obvious that to obtain a more powerful partial discharge signal, we have to feed the specimen with a higher voltage which is not always possible in laboratory.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The work {{presented}} {{has been}} carried out to obtain a better insight into electrical aging phenomena of mica insulation as used in high voltage rotating machines. Model bars with typical insulating materials were exposed to standard electrical aging and stimu-lated tree propagation at a new electrode arrangement. The results show that time to breakdown under elec-trical load is mainly determined by electrical treeing. Tree growth must be considered to start at the same instant voltage is being applied. Micrographs show that the tree propagates mainly along the interface binder resin-mica-carrier material. If the mica layer is damaged the tree can also penetrate the mica tape itself. Higher breakdown time values were measured at insulation materials with higher mica content and a higher number of thinner tape layers. To judge from the results, electrical tree growth manifests itself as the main process of electrical aging. Further research for advanced materials and improved application proc-esses in <b>generator</b> <b>bar</b> manufacturing has therefore to be focused on electrical treeing...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} detect the {{degradation}} of high voltage machine insulation, partial discharge (PD) measure-ments are often used. While certain defects can be identified by PD measurements a correlation between PD activity and remaining insulation life or immanent insulation failure has {{so far not been}} convincingly demonstrated. As former investigations show, the main electrical degradation process of generator bars is electrical treeing. The electrical treeing and the PD generated thereby have therefore been investigated on <b>generator</b> <b>bar</b> insulations. The results show that treeing mainly causes delamination within the material. Dis-charges in such delaminations lead to a rise in apparent charge, maximum apparent charge and cumulated charge. The measured apparent charge could be calcu-lated from the size of deterioration structures as ob-served in micrographs. The cumulated charge shows a characteristic bend that occurs by a change from lower to higher PD. Higher PD values are usually caused by serious material degradation. The bend in the curve of cumulated charge depends on the material and takes place between 4 % and 41 % of the total time to breakdown. It may be used as a criterion for paying more attention to the survey of the material or for consideration of repair work...|$|E

Analysis of survey results lead to conclusion that transferred overvoltages can endanger 15. 65 kV transformer windings and stator winding insulation.

Laboratory-scale powder processes were established to produce PZT billets from these powders.

The development of these processes supported the powder synthesis efforts and enabled comparisons between different chem-prep routes...|$|R

In addition in some nuclear stations the turbine generator can power the station's house loads while the station is online via station service transformers which tap power from the <b>generator</b> output bus <b>bars</b> {{before they reach the}} step-up transformer (these stations also have station service transformers that receive offsite power directly from the switch yard).

50|$|In the 1960s, TVA began {{expanding}} {{the size of}} its dam locks to accommodate the increase in river traffic the Tennessee Valley had experienced since the end of World War II. A study in 1963 suggested that {{expanding the}} size of the Hales Bar lock would be extremely expensive, and considering the continued expenses involved with leak repair, TVA decided that would be more practical to replace the dam altogether. Nickajack Dam was authorized in January 1963 and construction was completed December 14, 1967. Operations were halted at Hales Bar Dam the following day, and by September 1968, Hales Bar Dam had been dismantled {{to the extent that it}} no longer threatened navigation on the new Nickajack Lake. Two of Hales <b>Bar's</b> <b>generators</b> and parts of Hales Bar's switchyard were installed at Nickajack.|$|R

Considering four investments technologies for power generation, hydro, coal, diesel, and for the joint venture an advantageous hydro technology which can only be build in a large scale (HidroAys√©n), we use an oligopolistic Cournot model and a Benevolent Social Planner, that minimizes the cost of electricity production and investment, both calibrated to Chilean power industry, to assess the efficiency of alternative investment strategies. We explore conditions whether the HidroAys√©n joint venture project of the two main power <b>generators</b> can be <b>barred</b> to be judge as an anti-competitive strategy. The Benevolent Social Planner optimal investment model suggests that the HidroAys√©n joint venture cannot be neglected as a social efficient investment or pro-competitive behavior {{on the part of the}} two largest power generators.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the performance of a high lift profile for low pressure turbines at Reynolds numbers lower than in previous investigations. The separate and combined effects of roughness and wake passing are compared. The effect of incidence on cascade losses is also evaluated. The experimental investigation was carried out in the high speed wind tunnel of Whittle Laboratory, University of Cambridge. This is a closed circuit, continuous wind tunnel where the Reynolds number and Mach number can be fixed independently. The unsteadiness caused by wake passing in front of the blades is reproduced using a wake <b>generator</b> with rotating <b>bars.</b> The results obtained confirm that the beneficial effect of unsteadiness on losses is also present at the lowest Reynolds number examined (Re 3 = 0. 2 √ó 105). Roughening the surface also had a beneficial effect on the losses but this effect vanishes at the lower Reynolds numbers, i. e. (Re 3 0. 3 √ó 105), where the surface becomes hydraulically smooth. The present study suggests that a blade with as-cast surface roughness has a lower loss than a polished one...|$|R
