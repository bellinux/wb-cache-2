Struers based his new principle for electrolytic polishing on Count Alois von Beckh Widmanstätten and his early experiments {{from the beginning of}} the 19th century that revealed the structure of iron from a meteor which had come down earlier in the century. He noticed that the structure could better be seen on plane, fine polished surfaces. By pouring nitric acid over the surface and letting it react for some time, he actually made a <b>deep</b> <b>etch</b> which developed the macrostructure.

40|$|The {{dissolution}} {{behavior of}} the barite (001) surface in pure water at 30 ℃ was investigated using in situ Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), {{to better understand the}} dissolution mechanism and the microtopographical changes that occur during the dissolution, such as steps and etch pits. The dissolution of the barite (001) surface started with the slow retreat of steps, after which, about 60 min later, the steps of one unit cell layer or multi-layers became two-step fronts (fast 2 ̆ 2 f 2 ̆ 2 and slow 2 ̆ 2 s 2 ̆ 2 steps) with a half-unit cell layer showing different retreat rates. The 2 ̆ 2 f 2 ̆ 2 step had a fast retreat rate (≈(14 ± 1) × 10 ^ nm/s) and tended to have a jagged step edge, whereas the 2 ̆ 2 s 2 ̆ 2 step (≈(1. 8 ± 0. 1) × 10 ^ nm/s) had a relatively straight front. The formation of the 2 ̆ 2 f 2 ̆ 2 steps {{led to the formation of}} a new one-layer step, where the front of the 2 ̆ 2 s 2 ̆ 2 step was overtaken by that of the immediate underlying 2 ̆ 2 f 2 ̆ 2 step. The 2 ̆ 2 f 2 ̆ 2 steps also led to the decrease of the steps and the increase in the percentage of stable steps parallel to the [010] direction during the dissolution. Etch pits, which could be observed after about 90 min, were of three types: triangular etch pits with a depth of a half-unit cell, shallow etch pits, and <b>deep</b> <b>etch</b> pits. The triangular etch pits were bounded by the step edges parallel to [010], [120], and [12 ^^- 0] and had opposite orientations in the upper half and lower half layers. Shallow etch pits that had a depth of two or more half-unit cell layers had any two consecutive pits pointing in the opposite direction of each other. The triangular etch pit appeared to grow by simultaneously removal of a row of ions parallel to each direction from the three step edges. At first, <b>deep</b> <b>etch</b> pits were elongated in the [010] direction with a curved outline and then gradually developed to an angular form bounded by the 100, 310, and (001) faces. The retreat rate of the (001) face was much slower than those of the 100 and 310 and tended to separate into two rates ((0. 13 ± 0. 01) × 10 ^ nm/s for the <b>deep</b> <b>etch</b> pits derived from a screw dislocation and (0. 07 ± 0. 01) × 10 ^ nm/s for those from other line defects). The changes in the dissolution rate of a barite (0. 0. 1) surface during the dissolution were estimated using the retreat rates and densities of the various steps as well as the growth rates, density, and areas of the lateral faces of the <b>deep</b> <b>etch</b> pits that were obtained from this AFM analysis. Our results showed that the dissolution rate of the barite (0. 0. 1) surface gradually increased and approached the bulk dissolution rate because of the change in the main factor determining the dissolution rate from the density of the steps to the growth and the density of the <b>deep</b> <b>etch</b> pits on the surface...|$|E

In this work, the authors demonstrate the application of ICP-RIE techniques which capitalize on the cryogenic properties to create different sensors geometries: optical, electrical, magnetic, and mechanical. The three techniques demonstrated are (1) single step <b>deep</b> <b>etches</b> with controllable sidewall profiles.

Passivation layers are formed during the passivation step by neutrals’ deposition and are reinforced during the etching step by the redeposition of sputtered fluorocarbon species from the etch front. When the sidewalls are passivated, reactive neutrals diffuse through Knudsen-like diffusion {{down to the bottom}} of the pattern to etch the germanium.

40|$|The micro rocket is one {{of several}} power {{microelectromechanical}} systems (MEMS) under development at MIT. The micro rocket is experiencing structural failures at operating parameters far below the designed performance level. The deterministic strength of brittle materials, such as silicon, is critically dependent on the local strength and flaw population. Experiments and correlating modeling were used to pursue the root cause of the micro rocket structural failure. This thesis presents the results of these experiments and analysis to characterize the strength of <b>deep</b> reactive ion <b>etched</b> single crystal silicon structures and to clarify the influence of geometry on a structure's characteristic strength. The test specimens used for this work were pressurized cavities with the same geometry as the micro rocket combustion chamber and radiused hub flexure specimens. These geometries were correlated with numerical models and finite element models for determination of failure stress levels. Applying Weibull statistics, the strength of the material and the effect of the specimen geometry were quantified. Scanning electron microscope inspection of the etched surfaces provided visual evidence of surface roughness conditions, supporting the experimental results. Pressure tests were used to identify failure modes of the micro rocket geometry without the complex subsystem geometries required for the operational device. A slight variation in geometric configuration of the chamber pressure ports yielded significant differences in device strength. Radiused hub flexure specimens were used to compare the strength of the micro rocket etch recipe, ADAM 06, to a baseline etch, MIT 69. Additionally, the radiused hub flexure specimens were used to characterize the role of a secondary isotropic smoothing etch in improving the effective material strength of <b>deep</b> <b>etched</b> surfaces. It was determined that the micro rocket etch was not optimized sufficiently to achieve baseline surface roughness. The role of the secondary isotropic etch was determined to be key in achieving high strengths in etched single crystal silicon. The experimental data was used to establish a scaling correlation for strength values from the two different specimen geometries. Using the effective areas of the two structures, characteristic strength for chambers was predicted based on the characteristic strength of radiused hub flexure specimens. The predicted scaling did not correlate particularly well with the data. However, the limited number of samples and a modeling inaccuracy are suspected to have significant influence {{on the quality of the}} prediction. Improvement of these conditions could yet yield a useful predictive tool. The results of this thesis are demonstration of the influence of specimen geometry and surface roughness on the characteristic strength of <b>deep</b> <b>etched</b> single crystal silicon structures. Additionally, the predictive scaling between different specimen geometries was attempted with marginal results that might be improved with further testing. Recommendations for future work include further investigation of the effects of slight variations in specimen geometry in fabrication and material strength, characterization of the smoothing effects of isotropic etching with time, reevaluation of the optimization of the micro rocket etch recipe, and further study of the nature of flaws introduced by primary <b>deep</b> <b>etches</b> and their behavior as surface or volume flaws. by Erin E.
