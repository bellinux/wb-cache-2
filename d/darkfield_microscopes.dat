40|$|Precipitative mixing {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} {{with the aid of}} a turbidimeter and a <b>darkfield</b> <b>microscope.</b> The results of these experiments, correlated with observations of macroscopic features, indicate that serological precipitation is largely governed by a highly specific mechanism except in the terminal period, when the operation of non-specific forces becomes apparent. The findings are used as the basis for a new description of precipitation in terms of the formation and aggregation of elementary particles of specific precipitate, called seromicrons...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{multifunctional}} darkfield microscopy using an axicon. It combines {{the functions of}} a <b>darkfield</b> <b>microscope,</b> fluorescence microscope, and microspectrophotometer in one platform. The advantage of the system over conventional darkfield microscopy includes the high transmittance of the illuminating flux, the high contrast of the image, and the convenient toggle between darkfield and brightfield microscopy. Examples of dark, bright, and fluorescent micrographs as well as concerned spectra of microsized specimens implemented in this apparatus are demonstrated.

The erythrocytes were lysed by dilution of whole blood with 2 M urea and the re-mainmg platelets and leukocytes were enumerated by a <b>darkfield</b> <b>microscope</b> optical system that detects light diffracted by them. A suspension of fixed human platelets available commercially was highly satisfactory for standardization. The method gave accurate and repro-ducible platelet counts, comparable with those of electronic particle counting on venous blood and substantially mor...|$|R
50|$|Shortly after graduation, Livingston {{became the}} first female {{resident}} physician at a New York hospital where she was assigned to treat prostitutes infected with venereal diseases. While there, Livingston {{became interested in the}} study of tuberculosis and leprosy, and later scleroderma, a disease affecting the tissues and skin. After studying scleroderma tissues with the <b>darkfield</b> <b>microscope,</b> she claimed to find an acid-fast organism that consistently appeared in her slides. Thinking that scleroderma had some characteristics that were like cancer, Livingston then began studying malignant tissues and subsequently claimed to find evidence of acid-fast organisms in every sample. It was this early research that prompted the young physician to devote her career to the study of a specific microorganism involved in cancer.|$|R
40|$|INVESTIGATIONS of the {{vitreous}} body are beset with numerous technical difficulties. Its large water {{content and the}} instability of its structure {{make it difficult to}} obtain unchanged {{vitreous body}} in large amounts. Through the slit lamp and in fixed histological preparations (Lauber, 1936; Baurmann, 1926; Comberg, 1924; Duke-Elder, 1930), the human vitreous body appears as a structured mass. In order to circumvent the criticism that such structures are caused artific-ially, new methods of investigation had to be evolved. Through the ordinary microscope fresh vitreous body demonstrates no structural elements. On the other hand, investigations with the ultramicroscope (Friedenwald and Stiehler, 1935), <b>darkfield</b> <b>microscope,</b> and phase-contrast microscope (Red-slob, 1932; Matoltsy and others, 1951; Grignolo, 1952) have not led to any single conclusion, but have given rise to the present view of the vitreous body as a gel, permeated by a net of submicroscopic fibrils. As Morner (1893) has shown, this structural part can be split off by fil...|$|R
40|$|Subgingival plaque {{samples were}} taken from upper and lower right canines, premolars, and first molars (distal, mid-buccal and lingual) in 10 periodontally healthy {{individuals}} after four days without oral hygiene. The samples were examined in the <b>darkfield</b> <b>microscope.</b> Counts and proportions of morphotypes {{were related to the}} location of the sampled sites. The influence of site location on the distribution of morphotypes was studied by multiple regression analysis. Inter-individual differences were significant for the proportions of cocci, nonmotile rods and fusiform organisms (p less than 0. 001), the influence of site location was not. Significant differences (p less than 0. 05) were found between total bacterial counts of samples taken from different sites: Distal-buccal samples contained more bacteria than did mid-buccal samples, mid-buccal ones contained more than lingual samples; samples from more posterior teeth contained more bacteria. The experiment was repeated after 5 weeks. The intertest agreement (kappa) for the presence of the different morphotypes ranged between 0. 13 and 0. 30. Coefficients of variation of the proportions of morphotypes determined in repeated samples were between 1. 35 and 3. 13. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} techniques {{have been used to}} study the development of vaccine virus infection. Himmelweit (1) examined the infected living chorioallantoic membrane of the chick embryo in situ with the oil immersion lens, using annular oblique, incident illumination. He described {{the increase in the number}} of bodies and the size of the infected area in the cell as a "shoal of fish in an ever extending pond. " Merling (2) using the <b>darkfield</b> <b>microscope</b> described a similar type of increase for the virus in rabbit corneal cells. Bland and Robinow (3) cultivated rabbit corneal epithelial cells in vitro, and in the infected, Giemsa-stained cells demonstrated cytoplasmic bodies which increased in size with time. And, recently Gaylord et al. (4), using the electron microscope, have shown various stages in the development of the virus in cells of the chorioallantoic membrane of the chick embryo. An excellent system was available to the present authors for the study of vaccine virus development in human cells. A fluorescent antibody system had been worked out for this viral agent (5) and it was well established that this technique was highly specific and gave good cytologic resolution (6 - 8). Furthermore, the strain of cells at hand were of an unusually large size with an extensive cytoplasmic area. This paper reports the findings obtained by the use of this system...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the occurence of spirochetes and Wolinella sp. in untreated, nonselected subjects and to relate the presence of these organisms to changes in probing depth over a period of 180 days. Clinical parameters were recorded and subgingival microbial samples were taken mesiobuccally on the upper first molars of 120 subjects (mean age 37 +/- 14 years) with a history of no regular dental care. The number of motile rods and spirochetes were determined in the <b>darkfield</b> <b>microscope.</b> The samples were cultured anaerobically on a selective medium which favoured the growth of Wolinella sp. The grown microorganisms were submitted to a number of tests for the identification of W. recta. Of the 172 sites investigated longitudinally, 73 harboured motile rods, 45 harboured W. recta and 88 harboured spirochetes. 13 sites showed an increase in probing depth of greater than or equal to 2 mm. A multiple regresssion analysis revealed no statistically significant correlation between the numbers of W. recta at baseline and the likelihood of breakdown during the observation period. The number of spirochetes at baseline, however, was significantly related to the changes of probing depth (p greater than 0. 001). It was concluded that spirochetes were more closely related to changes of probing depth in this population than the number of W. recta organisms present. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The light {{scattering}} and absorption properties of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) can be utilised {{for the detection}} of DNA. Binding of molecules to the GNP influences the local refractive index. The increase in refractive index can be measured as proportional red-shift of the GNPs extinction maximum; therefore GNPs are suitable for use as nanoparticle chemical sensors. Utilizing this method it is possible to detect DNA in naturally occurring quantities. In bulk measurements we have shown a red-shift of 7 nm of the absorption maximum (λmax) upon binding of thiolated ssDNA. Subsequently, we were able to follow the interaction between two sets of GNPs functionalised with complementary strands. Randomly immobilised GNPs were visualised with an inverted <b>darkfield</b> <b>microscope.</b> The use of a colour camera enables us to analyse the colour change of each individual particle in the field of view. A change of λmax of 1 nm can be detected by the colour camera, which corresponds to ~ 100 20 mer ssDNA molecules. For the detection of a single DNA binding events we are developing an assay for DNA detection, utilizing a second set of GNPs. The interaction of two GNPs within a range of 2. 5 times the radius of each other results in a shift of ~ 7 nm in λmax for the presence of one DNA strand. This increased shift makes the method not only more accurate but also easier to detec...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of defect-free mask blanks remains a key challenge for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. Integral to this effort {{is the development}} and characterization of mask inspection tools that are sensitive enough to detect critical defects with high confidence. Using a single programmed-defect mask {{with a range of}} buried bump-type defects, we report a comparison of measurements made in four different mask-inspection tools: one commercial tool using 488 -nm wavelength illumination, one prototype tool that uses 266 -nm illumination, and two non-commercial EUV ''actinic'' inspection tools. The EUV tools include a <b>darkfield</b> imaging <b>microscope</b> and a scanning microscope. Our measurements show improving sensitivity with the shorter wavelength non-EUV tool, down to 33 -nm spherical-equivalent-volume diameter, for defects of this type. Measurements conditions were unique to each tool, with the EUV tools operating at a much slower inspection rate. Several defects observed with EUV inspection were below the detection threshold of the non-EUV tools...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{treats the}} {{preparation}} and properties of silver-nanowires. It {{is divided into}} four parts: 1) Preparation and determination of the atomic structure {{and shape of the}} wires. A chemical reduction method was applied to produce silver-nanowires in an aqueous electrolyte. The thickness of produced wires proved to be constant over the whole length. The thickness distribution in the ensemble varied around a maximum at about 27 nm, the lengths extended in the experiments up to more than 100 µm. There was no correlation between thickness and length. The thinnest wires were of about 5 nm thickness. The cristalline structure was analysed by Dr. A. Graff (Uni Halle) with HRTEM diffraction. The wires consist of 5 triangular single-crystalline filaments, connected by (111) twin-boundaries. So the cross-section of the wires is pentagonal. The surfaces are atomically smooth. A statistically varying curvature of the wires was observed, which points to strains created by an angle defect in the pentagonal structure. 2) Observation of the nanowires by optical darkfield microscopy, and, for comparison, by SEM and TEM. Selection of single, isolated wires was successful by micro-manipulation. The wires were either deposited on quartz glass substrates or they were prepared as free wires which were fixed only at their end-tips. 3) Measurement of emission spectra of the scattered light from single nanowires and parts of them in dark-field Zsigmondy-Siedentopf configuration. Experimental results were presented as depending on linear polarisation of the light incident on the wire. The spectrometer, based upon a <b>darkfield</b> <b>microscope,</b> was constructed to measure the optical emission of single wires. Two peaks appeared in the optical emission spectra. The first is at about 440 nm. It was assumed to be due to a localized plasmon-polariton excitation with the electric field normal to the wire axis. It could be reproduced by simulation calculations of Dr. M. Quinten, for normal polarisation of the incident light. Another, broad, peak was observed at 650 nm when the incident light was polarised parallel to the wire axis, which was asigned to longitudinal, extending plasma waves. 4) Application of the silver-nanowire as plasmonic conductor. In collaboration with the group of Prof. F. Aussenegg and Prof. J. Krenn at the University of Graz, the propagation of plasma waves excited locally at one end-tip, was identified and their propagation length determined by two different experiments. This proved the plasmon propagation in silver-nanowires to be well suited for information transport on the µm-scale...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few decades, {{advances}} in nanotechnology {{have resulted in the}} production and use of inorganic nanoparticles (NPs). These NPs have been used commercially for a range of applications, particularly in the biomedical field, based on their exceptional chemical and physical properties, which are very different to that in the larger scale. Our understanding regarding the NP interaction with the cells following NP exposure, prior to their use it is very important. This was the motivation for the work carried out in this thesis. Initially, the investigation presented in the thesis involved the synthesis of spherical and hollow gold NPs, which were then capped by water soluble organic oligo-ethylene glycol ligand (OEG). The OEG-capped NPs were then functionalised by attaching a specific cell targeting peptide, lysine terminated-Tet 1, on their organic corona. The surface modification of the NPs by the aforementioned ligands, was carried out so that the NPs could be employed in the biological investigations carried out in this project. PC 12 and SH-SY 5 Y cells, neuron-like cell lines, were exposed to the synthesised gold NPs, and the fate of these NPs within the cells was studied by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The TEM images revealed that spheres and hollow gold NPs were found within the PC 12 cells, indicating {{that they were able to}} traverse through the cell membrane. Though, the pathway and cellular processes involved could not be specifically defined due to time constrains. Furthermore, the peptide-functionalised NPs targeted the GTb 1 receptors which are readily expressed on PC 12 and SH-SY 5 Y cells. Lysine terminated Tet 1 -functionalised NPs uptake seemed to be greater compared to OEG-capped NPs, and they were transported to the inner part of the cell around its perinuclear region. Nevertheless, further experiments involving fluorescently tagged NPs would give us an inside on the cellular events that take place following NP exposure, over time. In addition, western blot analysis of proteins involved in a cell stress response could give us information whether the cell is under a stress when it is exposed to gold NPs. Furthermore, the application of the hyperspectral <b>darkfield</b> <b>microscope</b> designed by the Muskens group for imaging of single hollow gold NPs on a TEM grid and in a biological sample (with fixed SH-SY 5 Y cells), was also presented in this Thesis. The low illumination intensity used (< 0 : 5 W/cm 2) is a very good aspect of this setup for future studies with living cells and gold NPs. For example, single hollow gold NPs could be used as spectral sensors of a particular cell signalling pathway...|$|R
40|$|Morphological {{effect of}} phenol on Spirilla cells was {{observed}} {{with a light}} <b>microscope,</b> a <b>darkfield</b> light <b>microscope,</b> a scanning electron microscope and a transmission electron microscope. Spirilla strains used were Spirillum itersonii and Spirillum peregrinum. As a control, Escherichia coli was used. The experimental results obtained are as follows : 1) Cells of Spirilla and E. coli showed a remarkable elongation at the subinhibitory concentrations (SIC : Sp. itersonii; 0. 02 - 0. 04 %, Sp. peregrinum; 0. 02 ‐ 0. 05 %, E. coli; 0. 1 - 0. 2 %). For example, the cells of Sp. itersonii showed an average number of spirals of 17. 4 turns, whereas the phenol-untreated normal cells showed 2. 0 turns. 2) In concentrations less than the SIC mentioned above, cells of Spirilla and E. coli exhibited no observable change in growth, movement, and shape. In the mean while, they died without morphological change over the SIC (namely minimum inhibitory concentration). 3) When the elongated cells of Spirilla and E. coli were transferred into fresh broth, they disappeared and the usual cells reappeared after 24 hrs of incubation. 4) In the negative staining, phenol-untreated normal cells of Sp. itersonii showed the septum-formation, but the cells with phenol treatment exhibited no indication of septum-formation. On the other hand, in the ultrathin sectioning samples, the elongated cells showed no significant morphological change in its outer, inner membranes and cytoplasm. 5) Both Giemsa- and Feulgen-staining of the elongated cells of Sp. Itersonii revealed its coenocytic character. Thus the possibility is indicated that the mechanism of elongation by the phenol may be {{similar to that of}} β-lactam antibiotics...|$|R
