25|$|Alternatively, some fires {{may have}} been because of the engine wiring harness {{bulkhead}} connector (C500) being located {{in the center of}} the engine bay above the exhaust manifold, where heat could possibly melt and ignite the wiring. The 1984 model had a magnesium grille over this area. In later models, the main engine harness connector (C500) was moved to the battery area, and was improved to some degree with better <b>heat</b> <b>shielding</b> wrapped around the wiring harness.|$|E
2500|$|The road racing {{version of}} the XR-750 used an {{aluminum}} oil tank, had a [...] fiberglass fuel tank, and a fiberglass fairing which included extra <b>heat</b> <b>shielding</b> to protect the rider's left leg when riding in a tuck position. On the top center of the fuel tank was a leather pad with a round cutout for the left-side fuel filler cap. Like the dirt tracker, it used a Ceriani fork and Girling shocks, two 36mm Mikuni carburetors and tuned dual reverse cone exhaust. Instrumentation consisted of a Smiths tachometer.|$|E
50|$|These systems {{often work}} in {{combination}} with engine cooling and exhaust systems. <b>Heat</b> <b>shielding</b> is necessary to prevent engine heat from damaging heat-sensitive components.

40|$|The Pioneer Venus probes {{approached}} Venus {{with high}} relative velocity. As {{they entered the}} atmosphere, they were rapidly decelerated by aerodynamic drag, {{and a great deal}} of heat was generated. To protect the probe structure and the scientific instruments, a carbon phenolic <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> was placed on the front of the probes. Because the design of <b>heat</b> <b>shields</b> for planetary entry is a developing technology, thermocouples were placed in the <b>heat</b> <b>shields</b> so that actual and predicted <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> performance could be compared. The function of the <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> is discussed, the probe environments during entry into the Venusian atmosphere are described, and some results from the <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> experiment are presented.

40|$|Exploratory {{tests have}} been {{conducted}} with several conceptual radiative <b>heat</b> <b>shields</b> of composite construction. Measured transient temperature distributions were obtained for a graphite <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> without insulation and with three types of insulating materials, and for a metal multipost <b>heat</b> <b>shield,</b> at surface temperatures of approximately 2, 000 F and 1, 450 F, respectively, by use of a radiant-heat facility. The graphite configurations suffered loss of surface material under repeated irradiation. Temperature distribution calculated for the metal <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> by a numerical procedure was in good agreement with measured data. Environmental survival tests of the graphite <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> without insulation, an insulated multipost <b>heat</b> <b>shield,</b> and a stainless-steel-tile <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> were made at temperatures of 2, 000 F and dynamic pressures of approximately 6, 000 lb/sq ft, provided by an ethylene-heated jet operating at a Mach number of 2. 0 and sea-level conditions. The graphite <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> survived the simulated aerodynamic heating and pressure loading. A problem area exists {{in the design and}} materials for heat-resistant fasteners between the graphite shield and the base structure. The insulated multipost <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> was found to be superior to the stainless-steel-tile <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> in retarding <b>heat</b> flow. Over-lapped face-plate joints and surface smoothness of the insulated multi- post <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> were not adversely affected by the test environment. The graphite <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> without insulation survived tests made in the acoustic environment of a large air jet. This acoustic environment is random in frequency and has an overall noise level of 160 decibels...|$|R

50|$|Snow Tracs in {{use today}} are often {{modified}} and {{it is common to}} find overheating problems plague these machines because <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> have been removed {{to make it easier to}} work on engines.

In either case the function was ultimately the same, to keep the exhaust and muffler heat away from the engine. The vertical <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> seems to have been commonly utilized on the Royal Marines and N.A.T.O. versions of the Snow Trac, it may have also been used on civilian versions.

40|$|Wind tunnel {{tests of}} a 3 % scale {{model of the}} aft portion of the SRB {{equipped}} with partially scaled <b>heat</b> <b>shields</b> were conducted {{for the purpose of}} measuring fluctuating pressure levels in the aft skirt region. During these tests, the <b>heat</b> <b>shields</b> were observed to oscillate violently, the oscillations in some instances causing the <b>heat</b> <b>shields</b> to fail. High speed films taken during the tests reveal a regular pattern of waves in the fabric starting near the flow stagnation point and progressing around both sides of the annulus. The amplitude of the waves was too great, and their pattern too regular, for them to be attributed to the fluctuating pressure levels measured during the tests. The cause of the oscillations observed in the model <b>heat</b> <b>shields,</b> and whether or not similar oscillations will occur in the full scale SRB <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> during reentry were investigated. Suggestions for modifying the <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> so as to avoid the oscillations are provided, and recommendations are made for a program of vibration and wind tunnel tests of reduced-scale aeroelastic models of the <b>heat</b> <b>shield...</b>|$|R
