The Obtuse <b>Horn</b> <b>Shell</b> also known as [...] "Mud Creeper" [...] is a relatively common snail found in muddy coastal areas. It grows to around 5-6 cm.

Fish hooks have been crafted from all sorts of materials including wood, animal and human bone, <b>horn,</b> <b>shells,</b> stone, bronze, iron up to present day materials. In many cases, hooks were created from multiple materials to leverage the strength and positive characteristics of each material. Norwegians as late as the 1950s still used juniper wood to craft Burbot hooks. Quality steel hooks began to make their appearance in Europe in the 17th century and hook making became a task for specialists.|$|R
50|$|Live {{specimens}} of this cephalopod are very rarely seen, {{because it is}} a deep-ocean dweller. The small internal shell of the species is however quite a familiar object to many beachcombers. The shell of Spirula is extremely light in weight, very buoyant, and surprisingly durable; it very commonly floats ashore onto tropical beaches (and sometimes even temperate beaches) all over the world. This seashell is known to shell collectors as the ram's <b>horn</b> <b>shell</b> or simply as Spirula.|$|E

In July, she sailed {{to the west of}} the Strait of Gibraltar and obtained its first successes, sinking the British ship Macon (5135 tls) on 25 July, and then the oiler <b>Horn</b> <b>Shell</b> (8272 tls), before turning for port. On 22 October, Barbarigo sailed again, under the command of Capitano di Corvetta Enzo Grossi, but the patrol was unsuccessful. On the next patrol, the submarine met a lighted ship, but Grossi torpedoed and sank her nonetheless (it was the neutral Spanish ship Navemar), on 23 January 1941.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we will provide}} a summary of {{evaluation}} results on student use, satisfaction, and academic outcomes resulting {{from the use of}} compensatory technology services. Evaluation results indicated a high level of student use, belief by students that compensatory systems were helpful, and improved student academic performance. Much of the literature on computer services for postsecondary disabled students has focused on Sections 504 and 508 concerns related to making campus computer resources accessible to disabled students (e. g., Brown, 1987, 1989; Keddy, 1988, 1989). Although access to existing computer resources is a necessary aspect of postsecondary disabled student services, a second type of computer service, compensatory technology, can also be provided. Compensatory technologies are applications that integrate the language generation, information processing, and communication capabilities of computers with the capabilities of the student to enhance overall functioning and alleviate limitations on participation (<b>Horn,</b> <b>Shell,</b> & Severs, 1986 b, 1988). The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide postsecondary service personnel with an overview of compensatory technology applications and a summary of evaluation results on student use of compensatory technology applications, student satisfaction with compensatory services, and student academic outcomes resulting from the use of compensatory services. The data to be discussed were obtained from a three-year evaluation of the Educational Center for Disabled Students (ECDS) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln...|$|E
50|$|The Fort Ancient peoples made tools from {{a variety}} of materials, {{including}} stone, bone, <b>horn,</b> <b>shells</b> and antlers; stone tools have been found more frequently than those of other materials. The culture is known by its distinctive small triangular flint arrowheads and large triangular flint knives. They made hoes for farming from mussel shells. They ground and polished stones into the proper shape for axes to use in felling trees. Most of the flint tools were made from varieties of locally available materials, showing the Fort Ancient peoples either felt no need for or did not have access to exotic stone varieties through trade routes.|$|R

She became fascinated by traditional African Art (exhibited at MoMA and in the Brooklyn Museum of Art), and began to mirror the African art practices of encoding and accumulation in her own work. The material of these pieces also informed Pindell's work: while African art embraces the use of objects in sculpture such as beads, <b>horns,</b> <b>shells,</b> hair, and claws, so Pindell's collages began to incorporate additional elements including paper, glitter, acrylic, and dye.|$|R

50|$|Banganga {{harness the}} powers of bakisi and the dead by making minkisi. Minkisi are {{primarily}} containers - ceramic vessels, gourds, animal <b>horns,</b> <b>shells,</b> bundles, or any other object that can contain spiritually-charged substances. Even graves themselves, {{as the home of}} the dead and hence the home of bakisi, can be considered as minkisi. In fact, minkisi have even been described as portable graves, and many include earth or relics from the grave of a powerful individual as a prime ingredient. The powers of the dead thus infuse the object and allow the nganga to control it. The metal objects commonly pounded into the surface of the power figures represent the minkisis' active roles during ritual or ceremony. Each nail or metal piece represents a vow, a signed treaty, and efforts to abolish evil. Ultimately, these figures most commonly represent reflections upon socially unacceptable behaviors and efforts to correct them.|$|R

There are various importance of Bhasma like maintaining optimum alkalinity for optimum health, neutralizing harmful acids that lead to illness; because Bhasma do not get metabolized so they don′t produce any harmful metabolite, rather it breakdowns heavy metals in the body. Methods including for Bhasma preparation are parpati, rasayoga, sindora, etc., Bhasma which contain Fe, Cu, S or other manufacturing process plays a specific role in the final product(s). Particle size (1 - 2 μ) reduced significantly, which may facilitate absorption and assimilation of the drug into the body system. Standardization of Bhasma is utmost necessary to confirm its identity and to determine its quality, purity safety, effectiveness and acceptability of the product.

50|$|The {{materials}} used in Kwakwaka'wakw art include wood, <b>horn,</b> bark, <b>shell,</b> animal bone and various pigments. For wood, western red cedar (Thuja plicata) is preferred for large projects, as it grows in abundance along the Northwest coast. Yellow cedar (Callitropsis nootkatensis) was used for smaller objects. The wood is sometimes oiled for smaller carvings. Wood was steamed {{to make it more}} pliable. Horn is used to create tools, usually cooking utensils.
