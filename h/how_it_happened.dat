500|$|The writing staff {{often used}} their {{individual}} life experiences for inspirations {{to come up}} with the storylines of the series' episodes.

Drymon said, [...] "The scene where Patrick is running to Mr. Krabs to tattle, with SpongeBob chasing him, is pretty much <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> in real life". The end of the episode, in which Mr. Krabs uses even more profanity than SpongeBob and Patrick, was inspired [...] "by the fact that my [...] mother has a sailor mouth herself".

[...] Luna said that the series' take on Reyes' origin story would mix elements from Felipe Smith's original comic with [...] "this new angle that we’re approaching from, but that new angle still draws from the source material."
