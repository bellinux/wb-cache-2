500|$|Esther has {{a romantic}} {{interest}} in Rex Matheson (Mekhi Phifer), who she idealises {{and looks up}} to. Despite her feelings, Rex {{does not appear to}} notice or reciprocate, actress Alexa Havins conjectures that [...] "he's so blind to her feelings" [...] due to him having [...] "this wall built up around him that it's hard to break through." [...] Phifer commented that Rex sees Esther as a sister and conjectures that Esther's interests in him are partly a result of her sensationalising his work. Despite her highly romanticised idea of field work, Esther is not as skilled in the field as more experienced agents Rex, Jack (John Barrowman) [...] and Gwen. However, being part of a new Torchwood team means that Esther is [...] "ripped away <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> and thrust into the world of Torchwood on the run." [...] During the later parts of the series the character has to fight physically against the team's enemies. Havins did not receive any training for these sequences, she felt that having been trained in fight sequences would have made Esther [...] "too slick, too trained, too perfect, too in sync {{with the rest of the}} Torchwood crew." [...] Instead of being able to take out her attackers easily, when Esther has to fight for her life it is [...] "raw and brutal" [...] and [...] "almost like a bar-brawl meets a chick-fight". Espenson notes that by the final episode Esther has earned a degree of admiration from Rex through her work for the Torchwood team, which she feels to be because [...] "he just can't fail to see how smart and brave she is." [...] In regards to being killed off Havins states that she knew it was a possibility from the moment she accepted the role due to the danger present in the series and its precedence for killing characters. io9's Charlie Jane Anders observed that the character's death helps serve to illustrate [...] "how hard it is to consign others to death, for the greater good." ...|$|E

5000|$|On Sunday 10 June 2001, Leila {{was found}} dead in her room in the Leonard Hotel in London just before 19:30 BST by her doctor. She was found to have more than five times the lethal dose of Seconal, a barbiturate, which is used to treat insomnia, in her system, along with a nonlethal amount of cocaine. She was found in bed, her body {{emaciated}} by years of anorexia, bulimia, and food intolerances. [...] According to a report on her death, which included information from an autopsy conducted by the Westminster Coroner's Court, she stole the Seconal <b>from</b> <b>her</b> doctor's <b>desk</b> during an appointment and was addicted to the drug, typically taking 40 pills at once, rather than the prescribed two.|$|R

5000|$|The Season 4 episode, [...] "Requiem for Adena", {{centers on}} {{the murder of a}} young black girl that shows {{similarities}} to the Adena Watson case. Bayliss becomes obsessed with the idea that the two cases are connected, to the point that his actions begin to jeopardize Pembleton's efforts to get a confession. He learns that many of the people connected with Adena and/or Tucker have moved on <b>from</b> <b>her</b> death much better than he has, and states that he has begun to hate Adena because he cannot do so himself. At the end of the episode, he takes a framed photo of <b>her</b> <b>from</b> his <b>desk</b> (where it had stood ever since that investigation wound down), packs it into an envelope with a carnation from his lapel, and drops the envelope into a trash can.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Bowen rose <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk,</b> {{putting her}} hand to her forehead, as if to soften a shock of {{headache}} that her change of posture had sent there. [...] "I will leave the letter with you, and you can send it or not as you think best. It's merely a formality, my writing to your mother. Perhaps you'll see it differently in the morning. Effie!" [...] she called to the child, who with her book shut upon her hand had been staring at them and listening intently. [...] "It's time to go to bed now." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{even after}} she had posted it the distracted mother could not pause or rest. Dolly tossed and turned in her sleep, and Herminia sat {{watching}} her. She pined for sympathy. Vague ancestral yearnings, gathering head within her, made her long to pray,--if only there had been anybody or anything to pray to. She clasped her bloodless hands in an agony of solitude. Oh, for a friend to comfort! At last her overwrought feelings found vent in verse. She seized a pencil <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk,</b> and sitting by Dolly's side, wrote down her heart-felt prayer, as {{it came to her}} that moment,-- ...|$|E
60|$|To satisfy {{herself on}} this point she went down stairs in the {{elevator}} and purchased a magazine at the news stand.

But Mary Louise knew him by his striped trousers and straightway congratulated herself on her caution. Undoubtedly the detective had figured on her telephoning and she had nearly fallen into the trap.|$|E
40|$|MARIANNE {{tossed the}} red curls <b>from</b> <b>her</b> eyes, intent on her work. She squirmed in <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> {{for a better}} position, her fingers {{tightening}} around the crayon.

50|$|I've {{always been}} {{interested}} in different sounds like that and listened to Brian Eno and different kinds of music that use non-musical sources often, and as I made this record I had a lot of that material: those loops and things I'd made from '81; I had vocal loops that Jarboe had made in 1985 on a little sixteen second digital delay unit which was actually the first sampler... we had these tape narrations we'd been collecting, that she got <b>from</b> <b>her</b> father's <b>desk</b> when he was an FBI agent - surveillance tapes; I interviewed my father because I'm interested in his life, and took a little snippet of his experiences... then we had new things we'd recorded with our 'band' from the last tour; and some stuff we did for a soundtrack for a film. I threw all those into the computer and assembled it that way. So, in some things, there's something from 1981 playing simultaneously with something from '85 playing simultaneously with something from 1996. It's cross-faded and blended and mixed so to speak in the computer, cut-up and sometimes looped and reversed.|$|R
50|$|General Beckman is the series' only regular {{character}} {{not based}} in the San Fernando Valley, and is usually seen only in video conferences <b>from</b> <b>her</b> office. Still, her on-site management of the Buy More's reconstruction {{is not the only}} time she has been shown away <b>from</b> <b>her</b> Fort Meade <b>desk.</b> She was in the field in two consecutive episodes, supervising the arrest of Alexei Volkoff at the Bartowski family's forest cabin, and subsequently participating in the capture of Fatima Tazi and rescue of Roan Montgomery in Marrakesh, Morocco. In the latter case, she called in an air strike on Tazi's counterfeiting presses and personally employed a rocket-propelled grenade to disable Tazi and prevent Montgomery's execution. Noticeably, the general dresses in her usual service uniform even in the field while her subordinate military personnel are in fatigue uniform. She also occasionally visits Team Bartowski in Burbank, particularly in season 4.|$|R
6000|$|I do {{not know}} that Nina ever had a more clearly-defined idea of the trick that Lotta had played upon her, than was {{conveyed}} to her by the sight of the deed as it was taken <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk,</b> and the knowledge that Souchey had put her lover upon the track. She soon learned that she was acquitted altogether by Anton, and she did not care for learning more. Of course there had been a trick. Of course there had been deceit. Of course her aunt and Lotta Luxa and Ziska, who was the worst of them all, had had their hands in it! But what did it signify? They had failed, and she had been successful. Why need she inquire farther? ...|$|E
60|$|The clock struck five--briskly, as if {{time were}} money. Ruth Warden got up <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> and, having {{put on her}} hat, emerged into the outer office where M. Gandinot {{received}} visitors. M. Gandinot, the ugliest man in Roville-sur-Mer, presided over the local mont-de-piete, and Ruth served him, from ten to five, {{as a sort of}} secretary-clerk. Her duties, if monotonous, were simple. They consisted of sitting, detached and invisible, behind a ground-glass screen, and entering details of loans in a fat book. She was kept busy as a rule, for Roville possesses two casinos, each offering the attraction of petits chevaux, and just round the corner is Monte Carlo. Very brisk was the business done by M. Gandinot, the pawnbroker, and very frequent were the pitying shakes of the head and clicks of the tongue of M. Gandinot, the man; for in his unofficial capacity Ruth's employer had a gentle soul, and winced at the evidences of tragedy which presented themselves before his official eyes.|$|E
60|$|But in {{what way}} would she conduct herself when the police should come {{to her on the}} {{following}} morning,--the police and all the other people who would crowd to the house? How should she receive her cousin Frank? How should she look when the coincidence of the double robbery should be spoken of in her hearing? How should she bear herself when, as of course would be the case, she should again be taken before the magistrates, and made to swear as to the loss of her property? Must she commit more perjury, with the certainty that various people must know that her oath was false? All the world would suspect her. All the world would soon know the truth. Might it not be possible that the diamonds were at this moment in the hands of Messrs. Camperdown, and that they would be produced before her eyes, as soon as her second false oath had been registered against her? And yet how could she tell the truth? And what would the Corsair think of her,--the Corsair, who would know everything? She made one resolution during the night. She would not be taken into court. The magistrates and the people might come to her, but she would not go before them. When the morning came she said that she was ill, and refused to leave her bed. Policemen, she knew, were in the house early. At about nine Mrs. Carbuncle and Lucinda were up and in her room. The excitement of the affair had taken them from their beds,--but she would not stir. If it were absolutely necessary, she said, the men must come into her room. She had been so overset by what had occurred on the previous night, that she could not leave her room. She appealed to Lucinda as to the fact of her illness. The trouble of these robberies was so great upon her that her heart was almost broken. If her deposition must be taken, she would make it in bed. In {{the course of the day}} the magistrate did come into her room and the deposition was taken. Forty-three pounds had been taken <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk,</b> and certain jewels, which she described, from her dressing-case. As far as she was aware, no other property of hers was missing. This she said in answer to a direct question from the magistrate, which, as she thought, was asked with a stern voice and searching eye. And so, a second time, she had sworn falsely. But this at least was gained,--that Lord George de Bruce Carruthers was not looking at her as she swore.|$|E
60|$|The {{servitor}} retired, and {{she waited}} in seeming calm, sitting at <b>her</b> <b>desk,</b> <b>her</b> trembling hand alone betraying {{the excitement of}} her mind.|$|R
