2500|$|In 1994, the [...] "New" [...] Piper Aircraft company {{introduced}} the Seneca IV, having achieved certification on 17 November 1993. This model {{was similar to}} the Seneca III offering minor improvements, such as a streamlined <b>engine</b> <b>cowl</b> for increased cruise performance. It continued to use the counter-rotating Continental TSIO-360-KB engines and gross weights remained unchanged. A total of 71 Seneca IVs were built.|$|E
2500|$|The compact {{dimensions}} of the V-8 engine enabled Buick to reduce Roadmaster’s wheelbase by [...] across the line, although styling differences behind the <b>engine</b> <b>cowl,</b> apart from new V-8 emblem hubcaps, were largely nonexistent. [...] Buick also introduced a new [...] "Twin-Turbine" [...] Dynaflow as a companion for the V-8 engine. Estimated to increase torque at the wheels by 10 percent, the new transmission provided faster and quieter acceleration at reduced engine speeds. Both power steering and power brakes were made standard. Air conditioning was a new option and, years before many other makes, a 12-volt electrical system was adopted.|$|E

2500|$|The basic {{formula for}} the 1936 to 1942 Century was {{established}} by mating the shorter behind the <b>engine</b> <b>cowl</b> Special bodies to the Roadmaster's larger straight-eight engine (and consequently longer engine compartment). (In contrast the 1940 Series 50 Super would combine the larger Roadmaster body with the smaller Special engine.) While the Special was powered by Buick's 233 cu in inline-8 was rated [...] at 3200rpm, Centuries produced between 1936 and 1942 were powered by the 320-cubic-inch producing 165 hp, making them the fastest Buicks of the era and capable of sustained speeds of 100mph, hence the name Century (100), earning the Century the nickname [...] "the banker's hot rod." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 1943, the G-6 was {{introduced}} with the 13mm (.51in) MG 131s, replacing the smaller 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17 – externally {{this resulted in}} two sizeable Beule blisters over the gun breeches, reducing speed by 9km/h (6mph). Over 12,000 examples were built well into 1944 although contradictory factory and RLM records do not allow an exact tally. The G-5 with a pressurized cockpit was identical to the G-6. A total of 475 examples were built between May 1943 and August 1944. The G-5/AS was equipped with a DB 605AS engine for high-altitude missions. GM-1-boosted G-5 and G-6 variants received the additional designation of [...] "/U2". and were clearly identifiable as they use a modified, aerodynamically cleaner, <b>engine</b> <b>cowl</b> without the usual blisters.|$|E

50|$|The Constitution had {{operational}} difficulties which prevented it from meeting its original design objectives. The large airframe needed {{more power than}} the four Pratt & Whitney R-4360s could deliver, and the engines had cooling problems. While this could be compensated for by flying with <b>engine</b> <b>cowl</b> flaps partially open, it increased drag and decreased range.|$|E
