5|$|The ships' hulls were {{constructed}} from transverse and longitudinal steel frames, and {{were divided into}} nine watertight compartments, with a double bottom that extended for 60percent {{of the length of}} the hull. Both vessels had two pole masts fitted with spotting tops. Nautilus and Albatross had different bows; Nautilus received a clipper bow, while Albatross had a ram bow like contemporary German light cruisers. Albatross also had a higher forecastle that extended {{to the base of the}} main mast, while Nautilus was completed with a superstructure deck that began just aft of the <b>fore</b> <b>mast.</b>|$|E

25|$|The brig's {{foremast}} {{is smaller}} than the main mast. The <b>fore</b> <b>mast</b> holds a fore sail, fore top sail, fore top gallant sail, and fore royal. Between the <b>fore</b> <b>mast</b> and the bowsprit are the fore staysail, jib, and flying jib. All the yards are manipulated by a complicated arrangement of cordage named the running rigging. This is opposed to the standing rigging which is fixed, and keeps mast and other objects rigid.|$|E
50|$|Although topsails {{of a kind}} {{were used}} at least as early as Roman times, they first came into use in Europe {{some time in the}} 15th century. Initially small and carried only on main and <b>fore</b> <b>masts,</b> they {{gradually}} increased in size and importance until {{by the middle of the}} 17th century and were the principal and largest sails of the ship, the first sails to be set and the last to be taken in. It was quite common for a ship to sail with topsails and jibs alone; the position of the topsails well above the sea ensured that they received a steady breeze even if the seas were rough.|$|R

5000|$|Original usage in 18th and 19th century square-rigged ships {{distinguished}} between the fore staysail, {{set on the}} forestay running from the foremast head to the ship's peak, the foremost part of the hull, and the jibs set on stays running to the bowsprit. Jibs, but not staysails, could also be [...] "set flying," [...] i.e. not attached to the standing rigging. Sails set beyond the peak were typically called jibs, set on stays running from the fore topmast to the bowsprit, or the <b>fore</b> topgallant <b>mast</b> to the jibboom or even the <b>fore</b> royal <b>mast</b> to the flying jibboom. A large square-rigged ship typically has four jibs, but could {{have as many as}} six.|$|R
25|$|In July Franchise and Magicienne were escorting {{a convoy}} of 109 West Indiamen back to England. The convoy had cleared the Gulf of Florida when it {{encountered}} a hurricane. Twenty merchantmen foundered and Magicienne was so damaged {{that she could not}} proceed and instead had to put into Bermuda for repairs. Franchise had lost her <b>fore</b> <b>mast</b> and main-top-mast but Dashwood was still able to rally the surviving merchantmen and bring them back to England.|$|E
25|$|Cymric was an iron schooner. She had {{a shallow}} draught of only 10.8 feet, three wooden masts, no poop deck, a flaring bow, a round counter-stern and very square yards on her <b>fore</b> <b>mast.</b> She {{was built by}} the Thomas yard for their own fleet. Her early days, under Captain Robert Jones, were spent in the South American trade running from Runcorn to Gibraltar {{and on to the}} Rio Grande, docking at the Brazilian port of Porto Alegre. In 1906 she was sold to Captain Richard Hall of Arklow.|$|E
500|$|De Soto was {{powered by}} a [...] bore, [...] stroke single-cylinder {{vertical}} beam engine, built by the Morgan Iron Works of New York. The engine, which drove a pair of 30-foot sidewheels, was capable of delivering up to 14mph (12 knots)a good speed for the time, which would soon make De Soto a favorite with the travelling public and which would later prove invaluable for pursuing blockade runners during the Civil War. The ship had a single, raked smokestack forward of the engine, and two masts, one fore and one aftthe <b>fore</b> <b>mast</b> square riggedto provide auxiliary sail power.|$|E
5000|$|A four-masted jackass barque is square-rigged {{on the two}} {{foremost}} <b>masts</b> (<b>fore</b> {{and main}} <b>masts)</b> and fore-and-aft rigged on the two after masts (the mizzen and spanker or jiggermasts). Some 19th-century sailors called such a ship [...] "a fore-and-aft schooner chasing a brig". In general a jackass barque is a sailing ship which is half square-rigged and half fore-and-aft rigged. The name {{appears to be an}} erroneous reference to a mule, which is half horse and half donkey.|$|R

5000|$|Relieved by , Richelieu {{returned}} to Europe. From Algiers to Toulon, where she arrived on 1 October 1944, 52 months after having left France, she hosted Admiral Lemonnier, Chief of the Navy General Staff. Due to the ruined {{state of the}} French dockyards, she sailed for Casablanca, where she arrived on 10 October 1944, for careening. New British-built radars were set up, one Type 281 B for air warning on the <b>fore</b> tower <b>mast,</b> one Type 285 P fire control radar on the secondary directors, together with two auto barrage units (ABU). A new American SG-1 radar for surface surveillance was also installed on the <b>fore</b> tower <b>mast,</b> as the small SF Type radar, which had been installed at New York, was relocated {{to the roof of}} the conning tower. Then, the battleship was fitted with an FV1 jammer, to counter the German Fritz X and Henschel Hs 293 glide bombs, which had sunk the Italian battleship [...] and heavily damaged , in September 1943.|$|R
500|$|Between 15 November 1848 and {{the latter}} part of 1853, the sloop made three more {{extended}} deployments in the Caribbean-West Indies area as a unit of the Home Squadron. On 12 December 1853, Albany set sail from Boston, Massachusetts. In May 1854, the commander had filed a report with the Secretary of the Navy James C. Dobbin that the main mast of Albany was unseaworthy. On 20 May, Victor Randolph, the former commander of Albany and now commanding officer (pro tem) of the Naval Yard Warrington, reported that an appropriate mast had been identified and was ready for Albany. [...] During the replacement of the main mast, there was also some discussion of the condition of the <b>fore</b> <b>mast.</b> Apparently both were replaced.|$|E

500|$|Closely {{following}} Victory as {{she passed}} through the Franco-Spanish line across the bows of the French flagship Bucentaure, Harvey was forced to sheer away quickly, just missing Victorys stern. Turning to starboard, Harvey made for the 140-gun Spanish ship Santísima Trinidad and engaged her for twenty minutes, taking raking fire from two French ships, the 80-gun Neptune and the 74-gun Redoutable, as she did so. Redoutables broadside carried away Temeraires mizzen topmast. While avoiding a broadside from Neptune, Temeraire narrowly avoided a collision with Redoutable. Another broadside from Neptune brought down Temeraires fore-yard and main topmast, and damaged her <b>fore</b> <b>mast</b> and bowsprit. Harvey now became aware that the Redoutable had come up alongside the Victory and swept her decks with musket fire and grenades. A large party of Frenchmen now gathered on her decks ready to board the Victory. Temeraire was brought around; appearing suddenly out of the smoke of the battle and slipping across Redoutables stern, Temeraire discharged a double-shotted broadside into her. Jean Jacques Étienne Lucas, captain of the Redoutable, recorded that [...] "...the three-decker – who had doubtless perceived that the Victory had ceased fire and would inevitably be taken – ran foul of the Redoutable to starboard and overwhelmed us with the point-blank fire of all her guns. It {{would be impossible to}} describe the horrible carnage produced by the murderous broadside of this ship. More than two hundred of our brave lads were killed or wounded by it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Cherokee {{class was}} {{a class of}} brig-sloops of the Royal Navy, {{mounting}} 10 guns. Brig-sloops are sloops-of-war with two masts (a <b>fore</b> <b>mast</b> and a taller main mast) rather than the three masts of ship sloops. [...] Orders for 115 vessels were placed, including 5 which were cancelled and 6 for which the orders were replaced by ones for equivalent steam-powered paddle vessels.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the battle}} started Nelson's flagship, [...] broke the line ahead of Neptune, passing by and raking Bucentaure. As Victory passed by Neptune fired into {{her with a}} {{broadside}} from her larboard battery, damaging Victorys foremast, bowsprit, spritsail yards, her forward hull and her anchors. [...] Maistral then ordered Neptunes jib run up, to move her out of Victorys range. She briefly engaged [...] at long range, and then wore back to support Villeneuve. Standing someway off to leeward Neptunes gunners reloaded, and then opened fire with a broadside into [...] as the British ship came up through the gap created by Victorys passage. The broadsides cut Temeraires rigging, brought down her foreyard and main topmast, and damaged her <b>fore</b> <b>mast</b> and bowsprit. By now unmanageable, Temeraire came under fire from the San Justo, lying just astern of Neptune.|$|E
25|$|In sailing, a full-rigged brig is {{a vessel}} with two square rigged <b>masts</b> (<b>fore</b> and main). The main mast of a brig is the aft one. To improve maneuverability, the {{mainmast}} carries a small (gaff rigged) fore-and-aft sail.|$|R

Today the first three masts are rigged with double top-sails, single topgallants, royals and a main skysail.|$|R
2500|$|The first 28cm shell hit Blücher {{right in}} front of the aft mast, and set the midship area up to the <b>fore</b> <b>mast</b> on fire. The second 28cm round hit the base of the forward [...] gun turret shortly thereafter, {{throwing}} large parts of it into the fjord and igniting further fires on board. There was only time for the Main Battery to fire these two rounds, due to their slow reload time with only 30 untrained recruits manning them at the time. Only one gun crew of actual artillerymen was available, and two guns could only be made operational by splitting the real gunners between the two guns and using non-combatant privates to assist the gunners. The personnel pressed into service on the main guns included cooks woken up to man the Main Battery. There was no time to reload; there was not even time to fire the third gun, Josva, which was loaded but unmanned.|$|E
60|$|Another {{discharge}} from a heated gun, however proclaimed the rapid {{progress of the}} flames. The fire broke out of the interior anew, and the <b>fore</b> <b>mast</b> kindled.|$|E

50|$|A jibboom (also spelt jib-boom) is a spar used {{to extend}} {{the length of a}} {{bowsprit}} on sailing ships. It can itself be extended further by a flying jib-boom. The heel (i.e. rear and lower) end of the flying jib-boom is attached to the jib-boom, and the heel of the jib-boom to the bowsprit. The point (i.e. higher and fore end) of the flying jib-boom is generally the fore-most extent of a ship. The jib- and flying jib- booms carry the tacks of the jib and flying jib sails, respectively, and the stay for the <b>fore</b> topgallant <b>mast</b> and the royal stay.|$|R

5000|$|Due to the {{slowness}} of Warwicks progress Knowles ordered HMS [...] to pass her at 3pm. However it was {{not until}} 4pm that the Knowles flagship HMS , and HMS [...] entered the engagement. This time the combined British ships battered the Spanish and inflicted heavy damage on Conquistador which had soon lost <b>fore</b> and mizzen <b>masts</b> and could only manoeuvre in a small way.|$|R
60|$|The {{loss of the}} main-top mast and mizzen greatly {{relieved}} {{the strain}} on the ship, and she worked much easier. In half an hour, the first officer returned on deck with his party, and {{reported that he had}} done all he could to secure the <b>fore</b> <b>mast.</b>|$|E
