5|$|Saville and Fairchild went to Congress in 1950, and {{obtained}} $114million {{for the development}} of an electronic computer-based air defense system, a project headed by George E.

5|$|Approval {{was given}} on 26 January 1973 for {{full-scale}} {{development of the}} AWACS system. To allow further development of the aircraft's systems, orders were placed for three preproduction aircraft, {{the first of which}} performed its maiden flight in February 1975. To save costs, the endurance requirements were relaxed, allowing the new aircraft to retain the four JT3D (US Military designation TF33) engines. IBM and Hazeltine were selected to develop the mission computer and display system. The IBM computer receiving the designation 4PI, and the software is written in JOVIAL. A Semi-Automatic <b>Ground</b> <b>Environment</b> (SAGE) or back-up interceptor control (BUIC) operator would immediately be at home with the track displays and tabular displays, but differences in symbology would create compatibility problems in tactical ground radar systems in Iceland, Europe, and Korea over Link-11 (TADIL-A).|$|E

25|$|The F-104A was {{not very}} well suited for service as an interceptor. Its low range was a problem for North American air defense, and its lack of {{all-weather}} capability made it incapable of operating {{in conjunction with the}} SAGE (Semi-Automatic <b>Ground</b> <b>Environment)</b> system. The F-104As were replaced by the end of 1960 by more heavily armed all-weather McDonnell F-101B Voodoos. The F-104As were then transferred in 1960 to Air National Guard squadrons.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the interceptor squadrons, a Semi Automatic <b>Ground</b> <b>Environment</b> (SAGE) Data Center (DC-11) was established at Grand Forks in 1958. The SAGE system was a network linking Air Force (and later FAA) General Surveillance Radar stations into a centralized center for Air Defense, intended to provide early warning and response for a Soviet nuclear attack. DC-11 was operated by the Grand Forks Air Defense Sector (GFADS), activated on 8 December 1957 under the 31st Air Division at Snelling AFS, Minnesota. On 1 January 1959, GFADS {{was transferred to the}} operational control of the 29th Air Division at Malmstrom AFB at Great Falls, Montana.|$|E
25|$|Hughes Aircraft Ground Systems Group {{was located}} in Fullerton, California. The {{facility}} was 3 million square feet and included manufacturing, laboratories, offices, and a Munson road test course. It designed developed and produced the Air Defense Systems that replaced the Semi Automatic Defense <b>Ground</b> <b>Environment</b> (SAGE) in the United States with the Joint Surveillance System (JSS) AN/FYQ-93 including NORAD with Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) and provided defense systems and air traffic control systems around the world. These systems are massive and at its peak Ground Systems Group employed 15,000 people and generated revenue in excess of $1 billion per year. They were the largest revenue producer and with its massive systems engineering division coordinated the inclusion of products and systems from other Hughes Groups into the large system solutions.|$|E
25|$|Although McDonnell {{proposed}} the designation F-109 {{for the new}} aircraft (which {{was to be a}} substantial departure from the basic Voodoo), the USAF assigned the designation F-101B. It was first deployed into service on 5 January 1959, with the 60th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron. The production ended in March 1961. The Voodoo featured a modified cockpit to carry a crew of two, with a larger and more rounded forward fuselage to hold the Hughes MG-13 fire control radar of the F-102. It had a data link to the Semi-Automatic <b>Ground</b> <b>Environment</b> (SAGE) system, allowing ground controllers to steer the aircraft towards its targets by making adjustments through the plane's autopilot. The F-101B had more powerful Pratt & Whitney J57-P-55 engines, making it the only Voodoo not using the ‚àí13 engines. The new engines featured a substantially longer afterburner than J57-P-13s. To avoid a major redesign, the extended afterburners were simply allowed to extend out of the fuselage by almost 8ft (2.4m). The more powerful engines and aerodynamic refinements allowed an increased speed of Mach1.85.|$|E

Other Air Defense Command units conducting air defense missions from Otis AFB at this time included the 4707th Air Defense Wing, the 33rd Fighter Wing, and the 58th and 60th Fighter-Interceptor Squadrons.

In 1959, the Air Force constructed a counterpart to the Army's Nike missiles, and CIM-10 BOMARC anti-aircraft missiles were installed on a site northwest of the airfield. Otis was one of eight such facilities in the country. The site was run by the 26th Air Defense Missile Squadron.|$|E
