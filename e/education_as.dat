40|$|A long-standing {{issue in}} the {{literature}} on education is whether marginal returns to <b>education</b> fall <b>as</b> <b>education</b> rises.

The results indicate that marginal returns to higher <b>education</b> fall <b>as</b> the proportion of the population with higher education rises, consistent with the Becker Woytinsky Lecture hypothesis. ...|$|R
