To provide crowd control, a pavilion was built over the carousel and a ticket booth was installed. Neither was based on any extant buildings, but each was a composite of several other structures. The animals are removed {{one at a time}} from the carousel for routine maintenance and refurbishment, which is carried out in the museum's own shops.|$|E

5000|$|The {{standard}} <b>Fluid</b> <b>Drive</b> configuration {{consisted of}} the fluid coupling and a manual transmission and clutch in tandem. If the <b>Fluid</b> <b>Drive</b> was mated to a manual transmission, the driver still needed to use the clutch to shift between any of the gears. The presence of <b>Fluid</b> <b>Drive,</b> however, prevented the driver stalling when taking off from a dead stop. The driver could also {{come to a stop}} in any gear without using the clutch and could then proceed without shifting or using the clutch. Naturally, acceleration from a stop was much slower in high gear than it was in first. It must be emphasized that <b>Fluid</b> <b>Drive</b> was not a transmission, only a fluid coupling between the engine and clutch.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Fluid</b> <b>Drive</b> {{could also}} be mated to the {{semi-automatic}} transmission, which was not automatic in any way {{and should not be}} confused with <b>Fluid</b> <b>Drive.</b> With the semi-automatic transmissions, the driver shifted manually, selecting reverse or a low range and a high range. Each 'range' had two speeds. To shift between them, the driver accelerated then released pressure on the accelerator. In high range, this shift point was about 23 mph (37 kmh). The transmission shifted into high speed range, the driver then depressed the accelerator pedal, and continued accelerating. The solenoids on the transmission connected to the carburetor and ignition system and momentarily interrupted engine operation to allow trouble-free shifting.|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} {{fracture}} propagation {{driven by the}} pressure of the fluid flow between the fracture surfaces has been of considerable interest for understanding natural geological phenomena such as the formation of volcanic dikes and developing hydraulic fracturing technologies for industrial applications. Man-made hydraulic fracturing has been most commonly used for stimulation of oil and gas reservoirs to increase hydrocarbon production, stimulation of geothermal reservoirs, remediation of soil and groundwater aquifers, injection of wastes, goafing and fault reactivation in mining, and measurement of underground in situ stresses. Computational modeling and simulation of <b>fluid</b> <b>driven</b> fracture propagation in realistic geological formation has been a challenging problem because of various complexities including formation heterogeneities and the use of highly nonlinear engineered fluids. At present, one of the main obstacles for the robust industrial application of the simulating technology is the computational efficiency and stability. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the numerical efficiency and stability of various algorithms that can be potentially used in modeling of <b>fluid</b> <b>driven</b> fracture propagation. For simplicity, we have focused on fracture propagation in the plane strain condition. The fracture is assumed to in homogeneous linearelastic medium and modeled using displacement discontinuity boundary element method (DDBEM). The nonlinear power-law fluid flow is modeled using conventional lubrication theory. The coupled equations are then discretized using zero order elements for its efficiency. The coupled equations become increasingly stiff and difficulty to solve when the power law indices become smaller. Various numerical algorithms such as Newton iterationwith line search, trust-region and quasi-Newton method are investigated and compared. We have also extended the model to the <b>fluid</b> <b>driven</b> non-planar fracture propagation. A numerical crack propagation criterion based on the minimum local shear stress under mixed loading condition is proposed and compared with conventional theoretical and numerical criteria. The new crack propagation criterion provides more accurate and smooth crack initiation paths. Finally we have studied the geomechanics interaction between two simultaneous <b>fluid</b> <b>driven</b> fractures. The results provided some useful inputs for optimal design of multiple stage and multiple fracturing treatments along horizontal wells currently adoptedby the oil and gas industry for the economical recovery of unconventional resources such as shale gas and oil...|$|R
