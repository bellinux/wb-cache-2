Nor did he for a long while recover from this excessive rigor; his limbs still continued at intervals to twitch and shudder as with a convulsion, nor could he at such times at all control their trembling. At last, however, with a huge sigh, he aroused himself to some perception of his surroundings, which he acknowledged were of as dispiriting a sort as he could well have conceived of. His recovering senses were distracted by a ceaseless watery din, for the breaking waves, rushing with a prodigious swiftness from the harbor to the shore before the <b>driving</b> <b>wind,</b> fell with uproarious crashing into white foam among the rocks.

6000|$|He {{thought of}} the two women, in their silence, at last--he at all events thought of Milly--as probably, for her reasons, now {{intensely}} wishing him to go. The cold breath of her reasons was, with everything else, in the air; but he didn't care for them any more than for her wish itself, and he would stay in spite of her, stay in spite of odium, stay in spite perhaps of some final experience that would be, for the pain of it, all but unbearable. That would be his one way, purified though he was, to mark his virtue beyond any mistake. It would be accepting the disagreeable, and the disagreeable would be a proof; a proof of his not having stayed for the thing--the agreeable, as it were--that Kate had named. The thing Kate had named was {{not to have been}} the odium of staying in spite of hints. It was part of the odium as actual too that Kate was, for her comfort, just now well aloof. These were the first hours since her flight in which his sense of what she had done for him on the eve of that event was to incur a qualification. It was strange, it was perhaps base, to be thinking such things so soon; but one of the intimations of his solitude was that she had provided for herself. She was out of it all, by her act, as much as he was in it; and this difference grew, positively, as his own intensity increased. She had said in their last sharp snatch of talk--sharp though thickly muffled, and with every word in it final and deep, unlike even the deepest words they had ever yet spoken: [...] "Letters? Never--now. Think of it. Impossible." [...] So that as he had sufficiently caught her sense--into which he read, all the same, a strange inconsequence--they had practically wrapped their understanding in the breach of their correspondence. He had moreover, on losing her, done justice to her law of silence; for there was doubtless a finer delicacy in his not writing to her than in his writing as he must have written had he spoken of themselves. That would have been a turbid strain, and her idea had been to be noble; which, in a degree, was a manner. Only it left her, for the pinch, comparatively at ease. And it left him, in the conditions, peculiarly alone. He was alone, that is, till, on the afternoon of his third day, in gathering dusk and renewed rain, with his shabby rooms looking doubtless, in their confirmed dreariness, for the mere eyes of others, at their worst, the grinning padrona threw open the door and introduced Mrs. Stringham. That made at a bound a difference, especially when he saw that his visitor was weighted. It appeared part of her weight that she was in a wet waterproof, that she allowed her umbrella to be taken from her by the good woman without consciousness or care, and that her face, under her veil, richly rosy with the <b>driving</b> <b>wind,</b> was--and the veil too--as splashed as if the rain were her tears.|$|E

40|$|A {{synchronous}} rectifier using current driven {{approach is}} disclosed which can replace diode rectifier {{in most of}} the power converter topologies to enable low rectification loss. The present invention comprises a low loss switch and essentially a transformer with at lease one current sensing winding, windings for current sense energy recovery and one <b>driving</b> <b>winding</b> connected to a hysteresis driver which provides driving signal and power for the synchronous rectifier. A hysteresis driver is introduced which can reduce the noise interference to the driving signal, increase the operating frequency range, eliminate the saturation problem of the current sensing transformer and hence provide more flexibility to the transformer design. This synchronous rectifier is self-driven and the driving signal is independent of the input voltage of the converter which enhances its application to wide input range converter. Current sense energy recovery enables power converters to operate at high efficiency and high frequency. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|It is {{commonly}} believed that winds of cool giants {{in their late}} evolutionary stages are driven by radiative pressure on dust grains, but the actual grain species responsible for <b>driving</b> <b>winds</b> of M-type AGB stars are still {{a matter of debate}} (see Höfner, this volume). The optical properties of the dust particles responsible for initiating the outflow affect the stellar spectra in two ways: (i) indirectly, through their influence on the dynamical structure of the atmosphere/envelope and the resulting molecular features, and (ii) directly, by changes of the spectral energy distribution due to absorption and scattering on dust grains. The qualitative differences in the energy distributions of C-type and M-type AGB stars in the visual and near-infrared regions suggest that the dust particles in oxygen rich atmospheres are relatively transparent to radiation. By using detailed dynamical models of gas and radiation combined with a simple description for the dust opacity (which can be adjusted to mimic different wavelength dependencies and condensation temperatures) and also by adjusting the fraction of the opacity that is treated as true absorption, we investigate which dust properties produce synthetic photometry consistent with observations. The goal {{of this study is to}} narrow down the possible dust species that may be <b>driving</b> the <b>winds</b> in M-type AGB stars. Comment: 2 pages, 1 figure.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} a semi-numerical {{method of}} investigating the enrichment of the intergalactic medium by galactic winds. We find that most galaxies at z ∼> 3 should be <b>driving</b> <b>winds,</b> and that (if these winds {{are similar to}} those at low z) these winds should escape to large distances. Our calculations – which permit exploration of a large region of model parameter space – indicate that the wind velocity, the mass of the wind-driving galaxies, the fraction of ambient material entrained, and the available time (between wind launch and the observed redshift) all affect wind propagation significantly; other physical effects can be important but are sub-dominant. We find that under reasonable assumptions, the enrichment by 3 ∼ < z ∼ < 6 galaxies could account for the quantity of metals seen in the Lyα forest, though it is presently unclear whether this enrichment is compatible with the intergalactic medium’s detailed metal distribution or relative quiescence. 1...|$|R
