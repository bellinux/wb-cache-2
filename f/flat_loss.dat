Although it is likely that the slope represents the less pronounced downward spread of excitation, rather than accurate thresholds for those frequencies with non-functioning hair cells. Mid-frequency dead regions, with a small range, appear to have less effect on the patient’s ability to hear in everyday life, and may produce a notch in the PTA thresholds. Although it is clear that PTA is not the best test to identify a dead region.|$|E

This profile and the relatively robust distortion product otoacoustic emissions that are found in elderly subjects challenge the common belief that age-related hearing loss (presbyacusis) is based primarily on sensory-cell disorders. Here, we examine a model of presbyacusis wherein the endocochlear potential (EP) is reduced by means of furosemide applied chronically to one cochlea of a young gerbil. The model results in an EP that is reduced from 90 to � 60 mV, a value often seen in quiet-aged gerbils, with no concomitant loss of hair cells.

Degassing effects and thermal ageing effects have also been studied with the spectroscopy techniques. Thermal-electric behaviour and maximum voltages for thermal breakdown have been theoretically simulated for the model cables. Three loss origins of the XLPE cables have been found with different loss mechanisms. Conduction loss due to thermally activated electron/hole hopping dominates the lower frequency range from 10 - 4 Hz to 1 Hz; Semicon loss due to its in series resistance with the insulation layer in cable equivalent circuit dominates the higher frequency range from 102 Hz to 104 Hz; intrinsic polarization loss of the XLPE insulation has dominant <b>flat</b> <b>loss</b> spectra in the mid-frequency range from 1 Hz to 102 Hz. Degassing was found to decrease the conductivity of the model cables, while thermal ageing greatly increased the conductivity.

40|$|Introduction: The {{incidence}} of multidrug resistant tuberculosis is increasing in developing countries. Aminoglycosides {{are an integral}} part of second-line drugs, however ototoxicity is a major limitation for their use. This study aims to determine the extent of hearing loss in patients taking one of the commonly prescribed drugs for Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), Kanamycin, at a Government Medical College, Patiala, Punjab, India, which is a 1200 bed tertiary care hospital.  Materials and Methods: A total of 100 patients (68 males and 32 females) with confirmed diagnosis of MDR-TB were included in this study conducted between January 2012 and February 2014. Subjects were between 15 to 60 years of age, with a mean age of 37. 46 ± 10. 1. Pure tone audiometry (PTA) was performed before the start of the therapy, as a baseline, and was repeated after 1 week and 6 weeks of Kanamycin use to assess hearing loss as an effect of therapy.  Results: Of the 100 patients examined, ototoxicity was found in 18 subjects post therapy. Incidence of high frequency hearing loss was 2 % at week 1, and 12 % after 6 weeks of follow up. However, 4 % of the cases developed <b>flat</b> <b>loss</b> at week 6. The hearing loss was bilateral in 13 patients and unilateral in 5 patients. Ototoxicity was more common in males (66. 67 %) compared to females (33. 3 %). Maximum cases were found in the age group of 36 to 45 years (36. 8 %), the majority being from a rural background (83. 3 %). The association with socioeconomic status (P= 0. 024) and co-morbid conditions like diabetes and hypertension (P= 0. 001) reached statistical significance.  Conclusion:  Lack of specific guidelines to monitor patients taking aminoglycosides makes ototoxicity a major adverse effect of their use in MDR-TB. More studies are mandated to study the risk factors associated with the development of ototoxicity and for the development of alternate drugs for the treatment of MDR-TB...|$|E

MethodsClinical data from 110 hearing loss patients of both senium and pre–senium ages (95 males and 15 females, mean age = 74. 4 ± 12. 1 years) were reviewed. Patients aged from 50 to 59 years were accepted as the pre–senium control group (n= 15). The 95 senium patients (> 60 years of age) were divided into 4 groups according to age: 60 + group(60 to 69 years, n= 25), 70 + group (70 to 79 years, n= 26), 80 + group (80 to 89 years, n= 32) and 90 + group (90 years or older, n= 12). Pure tone audiometry thresholds were measured in all 110 patients. Hearing loss severity of each tested ear was rated according to the Goodman classification criteria. Besides, audiometric configuration was examined in each ear. ResultsAudiometric testing showed normal hearing in 65 ears (29. 5 %), slight to moderately severe hearing loss in 131 ears (59. 5 %), and severe and profound loss in 24 ears (11 %). Air–bone gaps were found in 12 ears (5. 45 %) indicating conductive hearing loss. Except the 12 ears with conductive hearing loss, audiograms showed gradually sloping loss in 99 ears (45 %), sharply sloping loss in 34 ears (15. 45 %), <b>flat</b> <b>loss</b> in 45 ears (20. 45 %), notch pattern loss in 5 ears (2. 27 %), trough and rising pattern loss in 2 ears (0. 91 %), total deafness in 2 ears (0. 91 %), and normal hearing in 21 ears(9. 55 %). On average, hearing thresholds increased {{at a rate of}} approximately 10 dB per 10 year for subjects aged 60 and older.

40|$|With {{the demand}} for more {{comfortable}} cars and reduced emissions, there is an increasing focus on model-based system engineering. Therefore, developing accurate vehicle models has become significantly important. The powertrain system, which transfers the engine torque to the driving wheels, {{is one of the}} most important parts of a vehicle. Having a reliable methodology, for modeling and parameter estimation of a powertrain structure, helps predict different kinds of behaviors such as torsional vibration which is beneficial for a number of applications in automotive industry. Examples of such cases are ride quality evaluation and model-based fault detection. This thesis uses the knowledge from the system identification field, which introduces the methods of building mathematical models for dynamical systems based on experimental data, to model the torsional vibration of an engine-load setup. It is a subsystem of the vehicular powertrain and the main source of vibration is the engine fluctuating torque. The challenges are handling a more complicated model structure with a greater number of unknown parameters as well as showing the importance of data information for acquiring better identification performance. Since the engine-load setup is modeled physically here, its state-space equations are available and a grey-box modeling approach can be applied in which the well-known prediction error method is used toestimate the unknown physical parameters. Moreover, a structural  identifiability analysis is performed which shows that all of the model parameters are identifiable assuming informative input. Two main aspects are considered to present an appropriate modeling methodology. The first is simplification of the model structure according to frequency range of interest. This is achieved by performing modal shape analysis to obtain how many degrees-of-freedom are necessary at different frequency ranges. The results show that a 7 degrees-of-freedom model can be simplified to a 2 degrees-offreedom structure and still have the desired performance for a specific application such as misfire detection. The second aspect concerns using an appropriate data set, which has the required information for estimation of the unknown parameters. By analyzing the simulation data from a known system, it is shown that the parameters of the 2 degrees-of-freedom model can not be estimated accurately using measurements from a normal combustion data set. However, all the parameters except damping coefficient converge to their true values by using a data set which has misfire in the input torque from the engine. A high estimation variance plus <b>flat</b> <b>loss</b> function indicate that the damping coefficient has no significant influence on the model output and consequently can not be estimated correctly using the available measurements. Thus, to increase the accuracy of the results during estimation on real data, the damping coefficient(s) is assumed to be known. Both the 2 and 7 degrees-of-freedom models are validated against a fresh data set and it is shown that the simulated output captures the important parts of the actual system behavior depending on the application of interest.

Clear speech {{has been shown to}} be more intelligible than conversational speech for a large variety of populations, including both hearing impaired (Schum, 1996; Picheny, Durlach, 2 ̆ 6 Braida, 1985; and Payton, Uchanski, 2 ̆ 6 Braida, 1994) and normal hearing individuals (e. g. Uchanski, Choi, Braida, Reed, 2 ̆ 6 Durlach, 1996) under a variety of conditions, including those in which presentation level, speaker, and environment are varied. Although clear speech is typically slower than normally produced conversational speech, recent studies have shown that it can be produced at normal rates with training (Krause 2 ̆ 6 Braida, 2002). If clear speech at normal rates is shown to be as effective for individuals with hearing loss as clear speech at slow rates, it would have both clinical and research implications. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of clear speech at normal rates for older individuals with hearing loss. It examined the way in which intelligibility, measured as percent correct keyword scores on nonsense sentences, varied as a result of speaking mode (clear versus conversational speech) and speaking rate (slow versus normal) in six adults aged 55 - 75 years old with moderate, sloping, hearing loss. Each listener was presented with nonsense sentences in four speech conditions: clear speech at slow rates (clear/slow), clear speech at normal rates (clear/normal), conversational speech at slow rates (conv/slow), and conversational speech at normal rates (conv/normal) read by four different talkers. Sentences were presented monaurally in quiet to the listeners via headphones. Results indicated that clear/slow speech was the most intelligible condition overall. Neither conv/slow nor clear/normal provided an intelligibility benefit relative to conv/normal speech on average, suggesting that for older adults with moderate, sloping hearing loss, the combination of using clear speech and a slower speaking rate is more beneficial to intelligibility than the additive effects of altering either speaking rate or speaking mode alone. It has been suggested previously (Krause, 2001) that audiological characteristics may contribute to the lack of clear/normal benefit for certain listeners with hearing loss. Although clear/normal speech was not beneficial on average to listeners in this study, there were cases in which the clear/normal speech of a particular talker provided a benefit to a particular listener. Thus, severity and configuration of hearing loss alone cannot fully explain the degree to which listeners from hearing loss do (or do not) benefit from clear/normal speech. More studies are needed to investigate the benefits of clear/normal speech for different audiological configurations, including individuals with <b>flat</b> <b>losses.</b> In addition, the listening tasks should include more difficult conditions in order to compensate for potential ceiling effects...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{an integrated}} continuously tunable third-order ring filter with a measured extinction ratio of 80 dB, a 100 x improvement over previously demonstrated integrated 3 rd or 6 th order filters. Using integrated thermal tuning elements, the filter can be tuned over 100 % of its 48 GHz free spectral range with 1. 3 dB insertion loss. The filters {{are fabricated on}} a wafer-scale foundry compatible Si 3 N 4 low-loss platform enabling integration {{with a wide variety}} of previously demonstrated passive and active elements. The high extinction ratio, low <b>loss,</b> <b>flat</b> passband and steep roll-off is desirable for a broad range of applications including pump-stokes separation for Brillouin scattering, idler separation in four-wave mixing and separation of entangled states for quantum communications that utilize nonlinear optics...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of radiation from a vertical short dipole above <b>flat</b> ground with <b>losses,</b> which represents the {{well known in the}} literature Sommerfeld radiation problem. We end up with a closed form analytical solution to the above problem for the received electric and magnetic field vectors above the ground in the far field area. The method of solution is formulated in the spectral domain, and by inverse three dimensional Fourier transformation and subsequent application of the Stationary Phase Method the final solutions in the physical space are derived. To our knowledge, the above closed form solutions are novel in the literature for the Sommerfeld radiation problem. Finally, the physical interpretation for the received fields formulae derived this paper are provided. Comment: 8 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
40|$|Biopsy {{findings}} in 55 cases of idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis (IGH) are reported. Most cases had a <b>flat</b> epidermis with <b>loss</b> of the rete pattern and a thickened orthokeratotic basket weave stratum corneum. The epidermis had markedly decreased to absent melanin in the basal layer and reduced numbers of melanocytes at the dermoepidermal junction. One-third of patients had a sparse perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, whereas the rest had no significant dermal inflammation. These findings are in concordance with current literature. However, small foci of retained melanin in the basal layer (skip areas) alternating with larger areas of melanin loss {{were present in}} almost 80 % of cases. This finding has not been reported earlier {{and appears to be}} quite specific to IGH and may be used as a clue to differentiate IGH from other similar conditions such as vitiligo and guttate morphea...|$|R
40|$|Multicell joint {{processing}} {{has been}} shown to efficiently suppress inter-cell interference, while providing a high capacity gain due to spatial multiplexing across distributed Base Stations (BSs). However, the complexity of the optimal joint decoder in the multicell uplink channel grows exponentially with the number of users, making it prohibitive to implement in practice. In this direction, this paper investigates the uplink capacity performance of multicell joint linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) filtering, followed by single-user decoding. The considered cellular multiple-access channel model assumes both Rayleigh and Rician <b>flat</b> fading, path <b>loss,</b> distributed users and correlated multiple antennas at the base station side. The case of Rayleigh fading is tackled using a free probability approach, while the case of Rician fading is addressed through a deterministic equivalent calculated using non-linear programming techniques. In this context, it is shown that LMMSE can provide high spectral efficiencies in practical macrocellular scenarios...|$|R
