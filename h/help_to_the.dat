5|$|After {{receiving}} highly exaggerated {{reports about}} the role of the Christians and their <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British during the Second Anglo-Mysore War, Tipu decided to minimise the threat to his kingdom from the British and banish the Christians of Canara. According to Severine Silva, this decision was the logical outcome of the plans he had nurtured since the time of the conquest of Mangalore with his father Hyder in 1768.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi opposed {{providing}} any <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British {{war effort}} and he campaigned against any Indian {{participation in the}} World War II. Gandhi's campaign did not enjoy the support of Indian masses and many Indian leaders such as Sardar Patel and Rajendra Prasad. His campaign was a failure. Over 2.5million Indians ignored Gandhi, volunteered and joined the British military to fight on various fronts of the allied forces.|$|E

First reinforcements, and then Wellington arrived. He took command and drove Ney back, securing the crossroads by early evening, too late to send <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Prussians, who had already been defeated.|$|E

5|$|Baldwin and {{his group}} arrived at Tyre on 16 September 1190. Richard did not arrive in Syria until 1191. It is unclear exactly why they were sent ahead of the king; perhaps it was {{to look out for}} the king's {{interests}} while Richard took a more leisurely route, or perhaps to rid the king's entourage of a family grouping around Glanvill that the king did not trust. Baldwin was not a member or close associate of the Glanvill faction, so most likely he was sent ahead to look after the king's interests, whatever the reasons for the inclusion of his companions. Another concern may have been to get <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of Jerusalem as quickly as possible after the king learned of Frederick Barbarossa's death {{on the way to the}} Holy Land.|$|E
5|$|Bonfatti {{announced}} that Santa Fe province would provide financial <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{victims of the}} explosion. Since most houses in the vicinity were damaged, affected families would receive a subsidy of $20,000 to rent homes during reconstruction. They would receive $50,000 in credit to buy furniture and appliances, payable in 60 months with five percent interest. Rosario's real estate firms prepared a list of houses for rent without charging victims their regular fee. Some of the affected buildings may have had cheap insurances which would not cover the risk of an explosion. Some cars trapped in an underground parking lot could not be retrieved.|$|E

The enemy could have compelled us to fight before dark, he could have prevented our exercising our initiative, and finally he could have cut off our return to the German Bight.

5|$|The Romans, however, {{managed to}} stop further Islamic {{expansion}} into their lands during the 8th century and, {{beginning in the}} 9th century, reclaimed parts of the conquered lands. In 1000AD, the Eastern Empire was at its height: Basil II reconquered Bulgaria and Armenia, culture and trade flourished. However, soon after, the expansion was abruptly stopped in 1071 with the Byzantine defeat in the Battle of Manzikert. The aftermath of this important battle sent the empire into a protracted period of decline. Two decades of internal strife and Turkic invasions ultimately {{paved the way for}} Emperor Alexios I Komnenos to send a call for <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Western European kingdoms in 1095.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Don was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone to make landfall in the United States during the 2011 season. The fourth named storm of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Don formed from an {{area of low pressure}} along a tropical wave, Don developed into a tropical depression on July 27, and on that same day, was upgraded to tropical storm intensity, based on data from a reconnaissance aircraft noted the presence of tropical-storm-force winds. It tracked across the Gulf of Mexico and reached a peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) before moving ashore in Texas on July 30 as a tropical depression, dissipating shortly afterwards. Initially, Don was expected to provide relief to the state, which was suffering from a major drought. However, the system dissipated rapidly just before making landfall, providing very {{little in the way of}} <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state; rainfall totals were less than 1 in (25 mm).|$|E

On his body are many scarification marks, one for every sin. Cumming had always been Singer's choice for the role, but at first he was not available due to scheduling conflicts. At some point, Ethan Embry had been reported to be in contention for the role. Ultimately, the film remained in development long enough for Cumming to accept the part. Singer also felt comfortable in casting him since he speaks German fluently. The drawings of Adam Kubert were used as inspiration for Nightcrawler's makeup design, which took four hours to apply. For the scene where Nightcrawler has his shirt off, Cumming went through nine hours of makeup. To best pose as Nightcrawler, Cumming studied comic books and illustrations of the character.|$|E
