25|$|The natives, whose {{presence}} causes so much disgust to you, often {{take pride in}} {{the fact that they are}} Italian subjects. In Libya, Somalia and in the recent war against their homeland, in foreign struggles, they have shielded you with their bodies, and sometimes paid with their lives. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> it is no exaggeration to say that the natives provided you the means with which you could overcome. The misinterpretation of so many merits and acts of heroism carried out for Italy can only be indicative of an essentially alien and imperial government.|$|E
25|$|I {{have just}} had an {{interview}} with Andrássy. He set forth his views clearly and plainly. I quite understood them and arrived at the conclusion that if you would trust him – and trust him entirely – we might still be saved, not only Hungary, but the monarchy, too.... <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> you are not dealing with a man desirous of playing a part at any price or striving for a position; on the contrary, he is risking his present position, which is a fine one. But approaching shipwreck, he, too, is prepared to do all {{in his power to}} save it; what he possesses – his understanding and influence in the country – he will lay at your feet. For the last time I beg you in Rudolf's name not to lose this, at the last moment...|$|E
500|$|The {{outcome of}} this war will not be decided at Nanking {{or in any other}} big city; it will be decided in the {{countryside}} of our vast country and by the inflexible will of our people ... In the end we will wear the enemy down. In time the enemy's military might will count for nothing. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> the final victory will be ours.|$|E

"Inconvenient or not," [...] Mr. Philip Burr continued, [...] "I have {{orders to}} carry out which <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> <b>you</b> have never yet been disobeyed since the {{formation}} of our society.

500|$|The {{character}} {{later became}} the center of disapproval from viewers, who felt Declan was moving on too fast after Bridget's death when he developed feelings for Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer). Sorensen then backed the storyline, wanting his character to move on stating: [...] "It's a difficult situation. Declan was truly in love with Bridget. He was {{one of the lucky ones}} to have found his soul mate early in life, but at the same time, he has to move on and live his life." [...] further adding: [...] "A lot of people do think it's too soon for another relationship. But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> it's done very tastefully." [...] He then added an explanation to how Declan feels, adding: [...] "He feels as though he's cheated on Bridget and that he hasn't mourned for long enough to be able to move on without showing proper respect to the love of his life. He's left confused and upset." [...] As scenes from the storyline began to air Brewer made comment on the storyline reassuring viewers adding: [...] "I think they'll be okay with it... I think they'll be accepting. It's done very tastefully and very slowly. The two characters don't rush anything." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Making {{of those}} riots an ethnico-religious affair {{seemed to me}} {{particularly}} disgusting. When railwaymen are blocking France, nobody goes search further as their demands. Take any Norwegian or Swede, inflict the same life conditions [...] on them and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> they will end up burning cars too..." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 4 June 2013, Heynckes {{announced}} he would not coach a team during the 2013–14 season. On 21 June, {{in an interview with}} Der Spiegel, Heynckes said, [...] "After everything that's happened over the past two years, I'm ready for some peace and quiet. After this string of successes, I could transfer to just about any club in Europe. I {{have a problem with the}} finality of saying 'never'. But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I have no intention of coaching again. I had a worthy ending." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shintaro Ishihara [...] {{was born}} in Suma-ku, Kobe. His father Kiyoshi was an employee, later a general manager, of a {{shipping}} company. Shintaro grew up in Zushi, Kanagawa. In 1952, he entered Hitotsubashi University, and he graduated in 1956. Just two months before graduation, Ishihara won the Akutagawa Prize (Japan's most prestigious literary prize) for the novel Season of the Sun. His brother Yujiro played a supporting role in the movie adaptation of the novel (for which Shintaro wrote the screenplay), and the two soon {{became the center of}} a youth-oriented cult. Ishihara had dabbled in directing a couple of films starring his brother. Regarding these early years as a filmmaker, he stated to a Playboy interviewer in [...] 1990 that [...] "If I had remained a movie director, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I would have at least become a better one than Akira Kurosawa".|$|E
2500|$|The Hungarians, however, were {{repeatedly}} {{defeated by}} the Romanians. By the middle of July 1919, Hungary had begun a major offensive against the Romanian invasion. The Allied Commander in the Balkans, the French Marshal Louis Franchet d'Esperey, wrote to Marshal Ferdinand Foch on 21 July 1919: [...] "We {{are convinced that the}} Hungarian offensive will collapse of its own accord... When the Hungarian offensive is launched, we shall retreat to the line of demarcation and launch the counteroffensive from that line. Two Romanian brigades will march from Romania to the front in the coming days, according to General Fertianu's promise. You see, Marshal, we have nothing to fear from the Hungarian army. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>assure</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> the Hungarian Soviets will last no {{more than two or three}} weeks. And should our offensive not bring the Kun regime down, its untenable internal situation surely will.|$|E
