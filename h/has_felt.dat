5|$|The {{first edition}} of this work, {{published}} in 1861, was received so favourably that the author <b>has</b> <b>felt</b> bound to bestow his utmost care upon a minute and thorough revision of his book, {{in the hope of}} bringing up the information it contains to the existing state of knowledge. In this endeavour he has been assisted as well by Canon Lightfoot, to whom he is indebted for that section of the third chapter which treats of Egyptian versions of the New Testament (pp. 319-357), as also by much unsought for and most welcome help, especially {{on the part of those}} scholars who are named in p. 164, note. Without wishing to speak harshly of writers who are not very scrupulous in such matters, he has always thought it became him to borrow from no quarter without making a full and frank avowal of the fact. The author will be much rejoiced if this new edition shall be judged not less worthy than its predecessor to become a text book in Universities and Theological Celleges.|$|E

It is put under circumstances that naturally belong {{to one of those}} fluctuations in the condition of trade which, however unfortunate and lamentable they may be, recur from time to time. Undoubtedly I think that questions of this kind, whatever be the intention of the questioner, have a tendency to produce in the minds of people, or to suggest to the people, that these fluctuations can be corrected by the action of the Executive Government. Anything that contributes to such an impression inflicts an injury upon the labouring population.|$|E
25|$|In summertime village cricket is {{the delight}} of everyone. Nearly every village has its own cricket field where the young men play and the old men watch. In the village of Lintz in County Durham {{they have their own}} ground, where they have played these last 70 years. They tend it well. The wicket area is well rolled and mown. The outfield is kept short. It has a good club house for the players and seats for the onlookers. The village team play there on Saturdays and Sundays. They belong to a league, {{competing}} with the neighbouring villages. On other evenings after work they practise while the light lasts. Yet now after these 70 years a judge of the High Court has ordered that they must not play there any more. He has issued an injunction to stop them. He has done it at the instance of a newcomer who is no lover of cricket. This newcomer has built, or has had built for him, a house {{on the edge of the}} cricket ground which four years ago was a field where cattle grazed. The animals did not mind the cricket. But now this adjoining field has been turned into a housing estate. The newcomer bought one of the houses on the edge of the cricket ground. No doubt the open space was a selling point. Now he complains that when a batsman hits a six the ball has been known to land in his garden or on or near his house. His wife has got so upset about it that they always go out at week-ends. They do not go into the garden when cricket is being played. They say that this is intolerable. So they asked the judge to stop the cricket being played. And the judge, much against his will, <b>has</b> <b>felt</b> that he must order the cricket to be stopped: with the consequence, I suppose, that the Lintz Cricket Club will disappear. The cricket ground will be turned to some other use. I expect for more houses or a factory. The young men will turn to other things instead of cricket. The whole village will be much the poorer. And all this because of a newcomer who has just bought a house there next to the cricket ground.|$|E

[...] Academic Peter Wright has said about Moonbase 3 that its [...] "appeal to realism resulted in a disquieting sense of claustrophobia and isolation that undermined the optimism of its premise and captured the general mood of insularity felt (and often desired) in Britain in the early 1970s". [...] Moonbase 3, although not directly influential, {{can be seen as}} an antecedent of similar realistic, near-future, British space series such as Star Cops and Space Island One.|$|E

Madonna is also shown in the bejeweled corset flapping around a red cape. For the final verses and chorus, Madonna in the nude corset dances among the Minotaurs, and ultimately slays them all. The last visual shows the singer standing among the slain bodies of the Minotaurs, throwing off the cape while holding a pair of horns in her left hand. Red roses fall around her and sound of applause is heard as a quote by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche flashes on screen, [...] "Man is the cruelest animal.

500|$|The {{protagonist of}} the prior film, Alex Browning (Devon Sawa), was killed {{off-screen}} in the film. Rumors indicated that Sawa had a contract dispute with New Line concerning the deduction of his salary; however, Perry resolved {{the issue with}} the statement that [...] "it had everything to do with narrative, and nothing to do with money or Devon’s unwillingness to come back." [...] Despite this, New Line reinstated Ali Larter to reprise her character as Clear Rivers. [...] "When New Line asked me to come back, I thought it was great. They showed me the script and let me have some input, and it was really terrific," [...] Larter revealed. Larter indicated that Clear [...] " [...] gotten to a hardened place and tucked herself inside because she <b>has</b> <b>felt</b> so much pain in her life.

500|$|Beginning {{with the}} Analytical Reviews third issue, Mary Wollstonecraft became the key editor for dramas, romances, and novels. Scholars {{have speculated that}} her reviews are signed by the letters [...] "M", [...] "W", or [...] "T", {{corresponding}} roughly to her initials, {{in large part because}} they have identified her writing style in these pieces. Her reviews, which number over 200, are generally characterized by their concern for women's issues. Wollstonecraft scholar Mitzi Myers concludes that Wollstonecraft [...] "is not only a pioneer feminist, but also a pioneer feminist critic, whose analysis of the mesh between gender and genre inaugurates the feminist critical project". Wollstonecraft wrote excoriating reviews, criticizing the passive novelistic heroines of the time and praising, for example, the [...] "wise and resilient" [...] Mrs Stafford of Charlotte Smith's autobiographical novel Emmeline (1788). In highlighting this character, she [...] "singles out... the knowledgeable mother figure who <b>has</b> <b>felt</b> and thought deeply", one who resembles the women she described in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) as having [...] "power... over themselves". She derides the [...] "derivative, prescriptive, imitative, and affected" [...] and celebrates the [...] "natural, innovative, [...] imaginative". Evincing a particular regard for the works of Thomas Holcroft, such as Anna St. Ives (1792), Wollstonecraft celebrated their championing of innate nobility and virtue over aristocratic titles. Romanticist Anne Chandler argues that Wollstonecraft's reviews demonstrate [...] "an earlier Augustan politics of knowledge, variously outlined by Dryden, Pope, and, to a lesser extent, Swift" [...] which [...] "may be seen in her insistence on a continuum between aesthetic integrity and civic virtue; her belief in a metaphysical dialogue between human wit and divine Nature; and her perception of belletristic criticism as the proper tribunal for a new onslaught of scholarly and scientific research". While writing her last novel, [...] (1798), Wollstonecraft took advantage of her position with Johnson and reviewed almost nothing but novels, exposing herself to the wide variety of novelistic forms.|$|E

500|$|By the 1980s, critics {{emphasised}} {{the power}} of the poem's message and technique, and it was seen as an important English poem. After analyzing the language of the poem, W. Hutchings declared in 1984, [...] "The epitaph, then, is still making us think, still disturbing us, even as it uses the language of conventional Christianity and conventional epitaphs. Gray does not want to round his poem off neatly, because death is an experience of which we cannot be certain, but also because the logic of his syntax demands continuity rather than completion." [...] Also in 1984, Anne Williams claimed, [...] "ever since publication it has been both popular and universally admired. Few readers then or now would dispute Dr. Johnson's appraisal... In the twentieth century we have remained eager to praise, yet praise has proved difficult; although tradition and general human experience affirm that the poem is a masterpiece, and although one could hardly wish a single word changed, it seems surprisingly resistant to analysis. It is lucid, and at first appears as seamless and smooth as monumental alabaster." [...] Harold Bloom, in 1987, claimed, [...] "What moves me most about the superb Elegy is the quality that, following Milton, it shares with so many of the major elegies down to Walt Whitman's... Call this quality the pathos of a poetic death-in-life, the fear that one either has lost one's gift before life has ebbed, or that one may lose life before the poetic gift has expressed itself fully. This strong pathos of Gray's Elegy achieves a central position as the antithetical tradition that truly mourns primarily a loss of the self." [...] In 1988, Morris Golden, after describing Gray as a [...] "poet's poet" [...] and places him [...] "within the pantheon of those poets with whom familiarity is inescapable for anyone educated in the English language" [...] declared that in [...] "the 'Elegy Written in a Country Church-yard,' mankind <b>has</b> <b>felt</b> itself to be directly addressed by a very sympathetic, human voice." [...] He later pointed out: [...] "Gray's 'Elegy' was universally admired in his lifetime and has remained continuously the most popular of mid-eighteenth-century English poems; it is, as Gosse has called it, the standard English poem. The reason for this extraordinary unanimity of praise are as varied as the ways in which poetry can appeal. The 'Elegy' is a beautiful technical accomplishment, as can be seen even in such details as the variation of the vowel sounds or the poet's rare discretion in the choice of adjectives and adverbs. Its phrasing is both elegant and memorable, as is evident from the incorporation of much of it into the living language." ...|$|E
