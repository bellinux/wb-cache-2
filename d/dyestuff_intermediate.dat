5000|$|The firm of Brooke Simpson Spiller at Atlas Works in Berkshire Road {{had taken}} over the firm of William Henry Perkin at Greenford Green near Harrow in 1874,but {{subsequently}} disposed of some operations to Burt Bolton Heywoodd in Silvertown. Nevertheless, Brooke Simpson Spiller is the successor company to the founding father of the British Dyestuff Industry. [...] The company employed the brilliant organic chemist Arthur George Green(1864-1941) from 1885 until 1894, when he left to join the Clayton Aniline Company in Manchester and ultimately, when the British chemical industry failed his talents, to the chair of Colour Chemistry at Leeds University. At Hackney Wick, Green discovered the important <b>dyestuff</b> <b>intermediate</b> Primuline. He was a contemporary of the organic chemist Richard John Friswell (1849-1908) who was from 1874 a research chemist, and from 1886 until 1899 director and chemical manager. Perhaps even more distinguished was the Jewish chemist, Professor Raphael Meldola FRS, who is remembered for Meldola's Blue dye and is commemorated by the Royal Society of Chemistry's Meldola Medal. He worked at Hackney Wick from 1877 until 1885. where Meldola's Blue was discovered. A large collection of Hackney made dyestuffs is on view at the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney Australia.The firm of W.C.Barnes of the Phoenix Works was also engaged in the aniline dye industry at Hackney Wick.|$|E
40|$|Urinary and faecal {{excretion}} of radioactivity after {{either an}} intravenous or oral (1 mg/kg) dose of 35 S-labelled Tobias acid (2 -naphthylamino, 1 -sulphonic acid), a <b>dyestuff</b> <b>intermediate</b> structurally {{similar to the}} powerful carcinogen 2 -naphthylamine, was studied in rats. The Tobias acid was eliminated from the body within 24 hours of administration, almost exclusively through the urine. TLC-chromatography of faecal extracts and urine did not disclose the presence of excreted products other than unchanged Tobias acid {{and the search for}} inorganic 35 SO 4 in the urine by BaCl 2 precipitation was negative. There was significant absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, but neither cleavage of the sulphonic group nor other biotransformation by the intestinal flora was apparent under the test condition. There was no evidence that the sulphonic group of Tobias acid is cleaved in the body to a significant extent to give 2 -naphthylamine. This information should help in the evaluation of the occupational hazard potential of Tobias acid...|$|E
