40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a novel semantic parsing approach to query Freebase in natu-ral language without requiring manual anno-tations or question-answer pairs. Our key in-sight is to represent natural language via se-mantic graphs whose topology shares many commonalities with Freebase. Given this rep-resentation, we conceptualize semantic pars-ing as a graph matching problem. Our model converts sentences to semantic graphs using CCG and subsequently grounds them to Free-base guided <b>by</b> <b>denotations</b> {{as a form}} of weak supervision. Evaluation experiments on a sub-set of the FREE 917 and WEBQUESTIONS benchmark datasets show our semantic parser improves over the state of the art. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a linear analogue of Läuchli's semantics for intuitionistic logic. In fact, our {{result is a}} strengthening of Läuchli's work {{to the level of}} proofs, rather than provability. This is obtained by considering continuous actions of the additive group of integers on a category of topological vector spaces. The semantics, based on functorial polymorphism, consists of dinatural transformations which are equivariant with respect to all such actions. Such dinatural transformations are called uniform. To any sequent in Multiplicative Linear Logic (MLL), we associate a vector space of "diadditive" uniform transformations. We then show that this space is generated <b>by</b> <b>denotations</b> of cut-free proofs of the sequent in the theory MLL+MIX. Thus we obtain a full completeness theorem in the sense of Abramsky and Jagadeesan, although our result di ers from theirs in the use of dinatural transformations. As corollaries, we show that these dinatural transformations compose, and obtain a conservativity result: diadditive dinatural transformations which are uniform wit...|$|R
40|$|The {{notion of}} {{reference}} as entailment {{in the common}} ground provides a unified framework {{for the treatment of}} <b>denotation</b> <b>by</b> names, definite descriptions, and pronouns, including anaphors. Within this framework, semantic and pragmatic considerations are combined, giving two kinds of proof of <b>denotation,</b> <b>by</b> sense and by reference, for references to individuals which are and aren't already in the common ground. Different referring expressions such as names and pronouns are distinguished by their use to refer to more or less salient individuals in the common ground, which is structured by the discourse. The common ground is a construct distinguished from both the real world and the real beliefs of conversants. This property, together with the distinction between <b>denotation</b> <b>by</b> sense and reference, means that the notion of reference as entailment in the common ground extends naturally to intensional contexts, such as attitude reports. 1 Introduction In this paper I present an account of the [...] ...|$|R
