40|$|Bulk {{cargo ships}} are usually {{contracted}} under the <b>Charter</b> <b>Party</b> contract between {{the owner and}} the shipper.

In order to prepare appropriate documents, it is essential for the exporting companies to act according to the three important criteria (letter of credit requirements, UCP 600 and ISPB 745) prevailing in this regard. Since competence of complying presentation requires a certain level of expertise, the exporting companies established in Turkey have experienced difficulties in terms of how to prepare documents and could not get benefit from payment obligation undertaking of the applicant bank and of the confirming bank, if any, due to the presentation of discrepant documents, getting export prices late, and payment of extra fees/commissions.

40|$|The {{industry}} of shipping reaches {{far back in}} time but the traditional view with a shipowner offering his services is a mere memory. Developing from one actor offering all services more and more players have taken a role in shipping and the new industry {{that we have seen}} develop over the last 150 years consists of several parties carrying out different functions. Someone does of course own the ship but this is no longer equal to being the party carrying out the transport. More likely, the shipowner is only a name on a paper unaware of the actual shipping involvements on a specific level. Irrespective of which one of these two extremes we are faced with one thing is sure; the functions relevant for shipping today differ from the traditional arrangements. A changing industry requires new tools in order to function efficiently. This concerns everything from communication, financial setups to legal solutions that are in line with the structure we see today. In this thesis the focus is on how the legal solutions can help the market or the industry to work as efficiently as possible and in order to do so {{it is important that the}} content is desirable seen from a practical perspective. Furthermore it is important that the desirable position is unambiguously expressed. This will be the main focus in the following discussion. Concerning trade in bulk, chartering is the reality of today. A carrier enters into a chartering agreement with a charterer. This chartering agreement can be based on transport between destinations, on a specific time or on another basis the parties find appropriate to fulfil their requirements. The point being that there are many different ways to organize your trade today but common to all of them is that they will in almost every case start with a <b>charter</b> <b>party.</b> There are numerous interesting legal issues in regard <b>of</b> <b>charter</b> <b>parties</b> and in this thesis only one of them will be assessed. This is the question of liability. When we have a chain <b>of</b> <b>charter</b> <b>party</b> relationships governed by different terms and transport document between the charterer and a receiver in the end, it follows from the very nature of these contractual relationships that the issue of liability is central and complex. Who are the liable parties in this structure? The starting point for chartering is that this is an area of freedom of contract. The rational for this being that the parties involved are professionals with insight in the industry. With this said the position evaluated in this thesis is the legal position under the maritime code. Apart from the contracts this is the main legal source and it supplements all different contracts when they are silent or unclear. Furthermore it stipulates mandatory rules for some transport. The liability under the maritime code concerning <b>charter</b> <b>parties</b> is regulated in chapter 14. Either the liability derives from the <b>charter</b> <b>party</b> or from a tramp bill of lading. These are the two main documents governing this kind of transport. The carrier can be liable as contractual carrier or as performing carrier depending on whether or not the relationship to the contractual party is directly contractual or based on performance. When the document governing the transport of goods is a <b>charter</b> <b>party</b> the liability <b>of</b> the carrier concerning damaged or delayed goods is regulated in section 347 and section 383. The rules relating to <b>charter</b> <b>parties</b> are materially the same for both time- and voyage chartering in the code. In the first subparagraph the carrier s liability towards the charterer is regulated. The carrier is defined as the person who, through a contract, charters out a ship to another (the charterer). If the performing carrier is someone else than the carrier this party is caught by the reference to section 286 made in section 347 and 383 first subparagraph second sentence. The effect of the first section is in conclusion that the charterer has a claim for damaged or delayed cargo towards the carrier and the performing carrier, if this is not the same party. In the second subparagraph the carrier s and the performing carrier s liability towards a receiver who is not the charterer is regu-lated. When we have a bill of lading issued under a <b>charter</b> <b>party,</b> a tramp bill of lading, and this is endorsed to someone else than the charterer, this party s rights towards the issuer follow from the bill of lading. This is stipulated in section 325 in the maritime code. In order to establish the liability under a tramp bill of lading there are two main questions that has to be answered. First, when the carrier is bound by a tramp bill of lading. In this concern it is the distinction from liner trade that is important as the rules of presumption might result in different parties being bound by the master s signature. The evaluation depends on whether it is liner trade or chartering. Secondly, it is a question about the consequences when the carrier is bound. Or expressed in another way, the substance of the liability. In this thesis these rules will be evaluated from a practical basis according to the commercial patterns in the shipping industry. Who is the carrier under different aspects and more importantly, is the legal position of today also the desirable one seen from a practical perspective? By this I mean that if eth liability following from statute is in line with the structure we see under different <b>charter</b> <b>parties.</b> Is it reasonable that the targeted party under the code is held liable when looking at the contractual or actual functions undertaken...|$|R

30|$|The term ‘tramp {{shipping}} optimisation’ {{refers to}} the use of OR to maximise the revenue or minimise the cost of a tramp shipping problem, subject to the limited shipping resources. One such tramp shipping problem exists when there are some ships and some cargoes and it is required to find out the cargo mix assigned to each ship voyage which maximises total gross profit per day for all ships, subject to ship capacity and cargo time window (lay can). Name this problem area ‘optimisation of ship voyage’. To give more details on this area, consider the following facts. Unlike ‘optimisation in liner shipping’, both ports of call and port calling sequence are here assumed optional. <b>Charter</b> <b>party,</b> signed by the ship owner and the charterer, usually specifies terms and clauses to be followed by both <b>parties.</b> Non-demise voyage <b>charter</b> <b>parties</b> are assumed here. Terms generally include the following items: calling ports, calling sequence, cargo freight, cargo time window (lay can), allowable cargo handling time (lay days), dispatch count if actual days are less than lay days, and demurrage count if more. Loading and discharging lay days may be considered in reversible or irreversible manner. If reversible, lay days are specified for loading and discharging collectively. If irreversible, lay days are specified for loading and discharging separately. The gross terms <b>of</b> voyage <b>charter</b> <b>party</b> are here assumed unless otherwise specified. Before cargoes are being fixed by the ship owner, ‘optimisation of ship voyage’ helps in proposing a voyage plan suggesting an optimal cargo mix for each ship. This mix maximises the sum of voyage gross profit per day for all ships, subject to ship capacity, cargo lay can, and other voyage <b>charter</b> <b>party</b> terms. In the cargo mix selection, the random nature of sea transport demand has to be considered.|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that bulk {{shipping}} is a highly competitive market and is subject to volatile freight rates caused by an imbalance between demand and supply as well as changes in input costs. As such companies constantly face challenges of being competitive in the market and making profit. Companies need not only to keep operational costs low but also maintain a high level of customers' satisfaction and service quality. On the other hand, the scope and terms of shipping service are subject to negotiation and agreement between the shipper and the carrier; the delivery of shipping services are governed by a mutually agreed <b>charter</b> <b>party</b> that documents the terms and conditions of the contract <b>of</b> carriage. <b>Charter</b> <b>parties</b> have historically favoured owners and left charterers dissatisfied with the services provided, even though the services provided are as per the contract. This is mainly because the expectation of service is not well communicated; carriers monitor the expectation of service quality based on their past experience and market research, while the service quality expectations of shippers are beyond the terms and conditions <b>of</b> the <b>charter</b> <b>party</b> that often cannot specify the intangible elements of service quality. This study is the first and critical step in determining the overall gap between the perceptions and expectations of service quality in dry bulk shipping in Asia. Although the concept of service quality is not new in dry bulk shipping, it is often not well understood. The current study extends previous research on service quality to dry bulk shipping in Asia and investigates the contribution of the key factors to service quality as a means for carriers to differentiate their service and improve company competitiveness in the market. To achieve the above research objective, the quantitative primary data for the study are collected through an online survey and are then used to measure the gap between the service quality expectations of shippers and carriers. A survey questionnaire is developed based on Parasuraman, Zeithaml and Berry's (1988, 1992, 1995) approach adapted to dry bulk shipping. The results of descriptive and inferential statistical analysis suggest that a significant gap exists between the service quality expectations of shippers and carriers. It has also been found that shippers are willing to pay a premium for better service quality. This implies that carriers need to align their service quality with the expectations of shippers if they want to improve customer satisfaction and gain competitive advantage. Alternatively, improved service quality that is aligned with shippers' expectations would result in higher productivity, less delay, increased market share and profits. The study highlights that dry bulk shippers consider intangible elements of service to be more important than tangible elements. Shippers expect their carriers {{to do more than just}} fulfilling the terms and conditions of the contract of carriage. While, 82...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} dealing with legal issues that may arise in a course <b>of</b> <b>chartering</b> <b>of</b> vessels for the {{offshore}} special surveys (data collection). The offshore seismic data acquisition is used as the main example. However, {{a large part of}} the discussion can be equally relevant for the <b>charter</b> <b>parties</b> intended for other survey types (e. g., pipeline surveys, electromagnetic seabed sounding, and many others). The special survey operations are distinguished by use of the high technologies and, thus, expensive equipment. Most of these technical features are essential for fulfilling such tasks, and many of them are interrelated with issues <b>of</b> <b>chartering</b> a survey ship. Such agreements are most often based on the standard BIMCO’s (The Baltic International Maritime Conference) SUPPLYTIME 89 or SUPPLYTIME 2005 forms. The aim of the current research is, in general, to develop an understanding of possible legal implications of the use of SUPPLYTIME 2005 when chartering the special survey vessels The survey is typically run for a client (e. g., an oil company), and the relationship between the entity acquiring the data and the client are regulated by the data acquisition contract. In turn, the entity acquiring the data is the charterer with respect to the discussed <b>charter</b> <b>parties.</b> The data acquisition contract always prescribes minimum “standards of work”, which set strict requirements on the work of the ship and the equipment (both belonging to the shipowner and to the charterer). The problems considered in the paper could be provisionally divided into two categories. Issues attributed to the first category are related to the essence <b>of</b> the <b>charter</b> <b>party</b> <b>of</b> survey ships and the notion of “vessel’s work”. The second category embraces the issues related to the “equipment”. In general, it has been shown that the terms of SUPPLYTIME 2005 became less favorable to charterer in comparison to SUPPLYTIME 89. Considerable part of the outcomes of this research comprised of the findings related to the off hire. Firstly (i), it has been shown that in certain circumstances it is very difficult to fulfill the condition of “being prevented from working” under survey charters based on SUPPLYTIME 2005. Secondly (ii), it has been argued that such a cause for the vessel going off hire as failings and/or breakdown of equipment will be hardly found as a relevant cause to award the charterer to an off-hire, since such causes are not included in the wording of cl. 13 (a). It was demonstrated that the possibility that a court will find the condition (i) fulfilled and, at the same time, the cause (ii) falling within the scope of cl. 13 (a) is very questionable. This makes the charterer a vulnerable party in relation to the off hire. Possible ways to develop the standard form in connection with these and other issues were suggested...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} the price of transport we heavily relied on one kind of source which is found in massive numbers in the Amsterdam notarial archives: chartering contracts. A chartering contract is an agreement between a shipping company and one or more freighters or charterers who charter the ship for a particular voyage or, less often, for a specified period like a month. The freighter chartered the whole {{or part of the}} ship to carry a cargo from port A to port B at a certain price. The contracts conta{{in the name of the}} shipmaster who was acting in the name of the shipping company, his residence, the name of the charterer (s), the name of the ship, the freight charge and often but not always the tonnage of the ship and the kind of cargo and its quantity or weight. The chartering contracts are also called charter-parties or freight contracts. In Amsterdam lots <b>of</b> <b>chartering</b> contracts were notarized, which means that a signed copy was entered in notarial registers. An unknown number of them were not (Van Tielhof 2002 : 199; Knoppers 1976 : 17 - 18; Van Royen 1996 : 108). It is important to stress that these prices were the prices actually agreed upon for a specified transport service. The market for freights in Amsterdam must have expanded considerably in the course of the 16 th century, along with the expansion of overseas trade and shipping. In the 15 th century chartering contracts were probably still concluded on the first of the two big fairs, where foreign merchants appeared to look for possibilities to ship their goods (Posthumus 1953 : 130). At the end of the 16 th century chartering contracts were signed all year round. Jan Franssen Bruyningh started to work as a notary public in Amsterdam in October 1593, and had a large clientele of merchants and ship-owners from the start.
