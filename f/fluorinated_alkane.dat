40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this work}} is to improve charge {{injection}} by interposing an appropriately oriented dipole layer between contact and semiconductor in organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs). OTFTs are fabricated with pentacene semiconductor and gold source and drain contacts. The contacts are modified with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) made of alkane or <b>fluorinated</b> <b>alkane</b> thiols. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) shows a respective decrease and increase of the work function of the electrodes. Consistent with these results, we observe an increase and a decrease, respectively, of the contact resistance of the OTFTs, and a further decrease when shortening {{the length of the}} fluorinated molecule...|$|E

Substituting {{other halogens}} {{in combination with}} fluorine gives rise to chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) or bromofluorocarbons (BFCs) and the like (if some hydrogen is retained, HCFCs and the like). Properties depend on the number and identity of the halogen atoms. In general, the boiling points are even more elevated by combination of halogen atoms because the varying size and charge of different halogens allows more intermolecular attractions. As with fluorocarbons, chlorofluorocarbons and bromofluorocarbons are not flammable: {{they do not have}} carbon-hydrogen bonds to react and released halides quench flames.|$|R

40|$|There are two {{strategies}} for using CO 2 -soluble compounds {{to decrease the}} mobility of supercritical carbon dioxide. The first involves the “direct thickening” of CO 2, which is accomplished by dissolving an associative thickener in the scCO 2 that forms viscosity-enhancing macromolecules in solution. The second strategy is to inject a CO 2 surfactant solution into the porous media (which contains both brine and oil) that will generate a low mobility system of CO 2 droplets separated by surfactant-stabilized brine lamellae that bridge pore throats. Direct thickening was accomplished with surfactants that formed cylindrical, rather than spherical, micelles in scCO 2. The surfactants employed divalent cations (Ni, Co) rather than a monovalent cation (Na). Therefore, each surfactant had two tails (rather than one). Further, each tail was a double-tail or triple-tail that was tailored to be CO 2 -philic, consisting of either highly <b>fluorinated</b> <b>alkanes</b> or highly branched hydrocarbon groups. High pressure SANS was employed to establish whether the micelles were cylindrical or spherical. Further, {{the dimensions of the}} micelles were determined.

40|$|International audiencePartially <b>fluorinated</b> <b>alkanes,</b> arenes, and alkenes can be {{transformed}} {{by a variety of}} transition metal and lanthanide systems. Although the C–H bond is weaker than the C–F bond regardless of the hybridization of the carbon, the reaction of the C–F bond at the metal is usually more exothermic than the corresponding reaction of the C–H bonds. Both bonds are activated by the metal systems, but the preference for activating these bonds depends {{on the nature of the}} hydrocarbon and of the metal system, so that the reaction can be directed exclusively toward C–H or C–F bonds or yield a mixture of products. Additionally, the presence of fluorine differentiates between C–H bonds at different positions resulting in regioselective C–H bond activation; paradoxically, the strongest C–H bond reacts preferentially. The purpose of this review is to describe the field of reactions of partially fluorinated substrates with transition metal atoms, ions, and molecular complexes. The controlling physical properties (thermodynamics and kinetics) are described first, followed by a description of stoichiometric reactions, with the competition between the C–H and C–F activations as focus. A few representative catalytic systems are discussed. The review also highlights the benefit of combining experimental and theoretical studies...|$|R
40|$|Background: Proliferative vitreoretinopathy in the {{inferior}} retina remains clinically challenging. Heavier than water intraocular tamponades {{have been developed}} to improve inferior tamponading properties. In addition to inferior PVR, there seem to be other applications such as persistent macular holes or PVR in trauma eyes. Materials and methods: Review of the literature on clinical application of heavy tamponades. The review also discusses the theoretical background of heavy tamponades and possible future developments. Results: The parameters of an optimal intraocular tamponade are defined, and the influences of the specific gravity, buoyancy, interfacial tension, and viscosity are discussed. Perfluorocarbon liquids and partially <b>fluorinated</b> <b>alkanes</b> were associated with tamponade emulsification, intraocular inflammation, and rise in intraocular pressure that was less prominent in admixtures of these substances with silicone oil (heavy silicone oils). Two recently developed heavy silicone oil tamponades, Oxane HD and Densiron 68, are well-tolerated and have entered clinical practice. The side effects are associated with the chemical properties of the tamponading agent, and seem comparable to the ones seen with conventional silicone oil. Conclusion: Heavy silicone oil tamponade improves inferior tamponade, and may be considered a new generation of intraocular tamponades. © Springer-Verlag 2008. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|A {{numbering}} system {{is used for}} <b>fluorinated</b> <b>alkanes,</b> prefixed with Freon-, R-, CFC-, and HCFC-. The rightmost value indicates the number of fluorine atoms, the next value to the left {{is the number of}} hydrogen atoms plus 1, and the next value to the left is the number of carbon atoms less one (zeroes are not stated). Remaining atoms are chlorine. Thus, Freon-12 indicates a methane derivative (only two numbers) containing two fluorine atoms (the second 2) and no hydrogen (1-1=0). It is therefore CCl2F2.Another, easier equation that can be applied to get the correct molecular formula of the CFC/R/Freon class compounds is this to take the numbering and add 90 to it. The resulting value will give the number of carbons as the first numeral, the second numeral gives the number of hydrogen atoms, and the third numeral gives the number of fluorine atoms. The rest of the unaccounted carbon bonds are occupied by chlorine atoms. The value of this equation is always a three figure number. An easy example is that of CFC-12, which gives: 90+12=102 -> 1 carbon, 0 hydrogens, 2 fluorine atoms, and hence 2 chlorine atoms resulting in CCl2F2. The main advantage of this method of deducing the molecular composition in comparison with the method described in the paragraph above is that it gives the number of carbon atoms of the molecule.|$|R
40|$|Background: Heavier {{than water}} intraocular tamponades have several {{theoretical}} advantages over conventional tamponades, {{especially in the}} treatment of complicated retinal detachments and proliferative viteroretinopathy of the lower fundus periphery. However, initial clinical series of various heavy tamponades have reported significant complication rates. Therefore, heavy tamponades have not found widespread acceptance. Three recently developed heavy silicone oil tamponades, Oxane HD, Densiron 68, and HWS 46 - 3000, are much better tolerated and presently seem to enter routine clinical practice. Materials and methods: Literature review of 21 publications on the clinical application of 9 different heavy tamponades (fluorosilicone, C 10 F 18, F 6 H 8, OL 62 HV, Oxane HD, O 62, F 6 H 8 -silicone oil mixture, Densiron 68, and HWS 46 - 3000). Results: The first generation (fluorinated silicone and perfluorocarbon liquids) and second generation (partially <b>fluorinated</b> <b>alkanes)</b> of heavy tamponades were associated with relatively high complication rates, for example, tamponade emulsification, intraocular inflammation, and rise in intraocular pressure. The complication spectrum of the new generation of heavy silicone oils (Oxane HD, Densiron 68, and HWS 46 - 3000) seems to be comparable to conventional silicone oil tamponades while providing better support for the inferior retina and the posterior pole. Conclusion: The recently developed heavy silicone oil tamponades are safe and effective tools for the use of complicated retinal detachments of the inferior fundus. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Proliferative vitreoretinopathy in the {{inferior}} retina remains clinically challenging. Heavier-than-water intraocular tamponades {{have been developed}} to improve inferior tamponading properties, and their chemical compositions have been substantially improved over the years, in parallel with developments in vitrectomy instrumentation and surgical techniques. Herein we present an updated review of the clinical use of standard formulations and HSO, focusing on analysis of the intraocular inflammation associated with endotamponade agents, and comparison of the adverse effects of these agents on the physical and biological properties of the eye. Methods: A detailed literature search was conducted on PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar using the key words. Fifty-eight articles matched our inclusion criteria that were included in this systematic review. Results: Perfluorocarbon liquids and partially <b>fluorinated</b> <b>alkanes</b> are associated with tamponade emulsification, intraocular inflammation, and rises in intraocular pressure, but these associations are not as strong when these substances are mixed with a heavy silicone oil (HSO). Two recently approved heavy silicone oil tamponades, Oxane HD and Densiron 68, are now available for use in clinical practice. While the complication spectrum of the new generation of these HSOs seems to be similar to that of conventional silicone oil tamponades, they provide better support for {{the inferior}} retina and the posterior pole. Conclusion: Both regular and heavy silicone oils usually yield good success rates in cases of complicated retinal detachment. Decisions as to whether to utilize heavy or regular silicone oil should be made on a case-by-case basis...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The use of {{a mixture}} of {{silicone}} oil and partially <b>fluorinated</b> <b>alkanes</b> (high-density silicone oil) has recently been suggested as intraocular tamponade in complicated retinal detachment of the inferior quadrants. We describe a series of patients who developed a clinical picture resembling anterior granulomatous uveitis following endotamponade with high-density silicone oil. METHODS: We evaluated 19 eyes of 18 patients who underwent pars plana vitrectomy and intraocular tamponade with high-density silicone oil (Oxane HD). The indication {{for this type of}} intraocular tamponade was limited to cases with complicated retinal detachment of the inferior quadrants. Oxane HD was removed after a mean period of 3 months. RESULTS. One to eight weeks following vitrectomy with high-density silicone oil, an intraocular inflammation was observed in 7 of 19 eyes (37 %). These eyes presented with keratic precipitates (KP), pigmented clumps in the inferior part of the anterior chamber and increased anterior chamber cellular reaction. This inflammatory response did not react to topical steroids. In addition to KP a considerable amount of cellular precipitation was noted {{on the surface of the}} oil bubble. Strikingly, the intraocular inflammatory signs completely resolved following removal of the high-density silicone oil. CONCLUSIONS. An inflammatory response, resembling granulomatous uveitis, occurs in a significant number of patients after high-density silicone oil endotamponade. It is likely that this vitreous substitute is an immunogenic agent, given the complete resolution of the inflammation after removal of the high-density silicone oil. The routine use of this newly developed silicone oil should therefore await the outcome of additional controlled clinical trials...|$|R

OBJECTIVES: High production volumes and potential environmental releases of PFIs might become a concern, but the exposure risk and toxicity of these chemicals are still unclear. In this study, we investigated the potential estrogenic effects of PFIs.

RESULTS: FIAs have an iodine atom at one end of the perfluorinated carbon chain. 1 -Iodoperfluorohexane (PFHxI) and 1 -iodoperfluorooctane (PFOI) promoted the proliferation of MCF- 7 cells, induced luciferase activity in MVLN cells, and up-regulated the expression of TFF 1 and EGR 3. In these assays, other FIAs gave negative responses. FDIAs have an iodine atom at each end of the perfluorinated carbon chain, and all the FDIAs showed estrogenic effects. The estrogenic potencies of FIAs and FDIAs correlate well with the carbon chain length of the chemicals. The optimum chain length for estrogenic effects is six carbons, and then eight and four carbons. All FTIs have a single iodine atom at the end of a partially fluorinated carbon chain. None of the FTIs showed estrogenic effects in the tests. CONCLUSIONS: The estrogenic effects of PFIs are dependent on the structural features of iodine substitution and chain length.

40|$|AbstractUnder the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), {{currently}} 22 chemicals {{or groups}} of chemicals are regulated as POPs. However, various screening exercises performed on large sets of chemicals indicate {{that the number of}} substances fulfilling the screening criteria defined in Annex D of the Stockholm Convention might be much higher. Most of these screening studies searched for highly persistent and bioaccumulative chemicals, but did not include the long-range transport potential, which is a key criterion under the Stockholm Convention. We apply the screening criteria for persistence, bioaccumulation and long-range transport potential of the Stockholm Convention to a set of 93 144 organic chemicals. Because no toxicity threshold is defined under the Stockholm Convention, we use the toxicity threshold of REACH, the chemicals regulation of the European Union. For {{the vast majority of the}} chemicals, the property data required for the assessment had to be estimated from the chemical structure. Assessment results for the acknowledged POPs and for POP candidates currently under review are discussed. Beyond these well-known substances, we find 510 chemicals that exceed all four critieria and can be considered potential POPs. Ninety eight percent of these chemicals are halogenated; frequent types of chemicals are halogenated aromatic compounds, including polychlorinated diphenylethers, tetrachloro benzyltoluenes, brominated and fluorinated naphthalenes and biphenyls; and highly or fully chlorinated and <b>fluorinated</b> <b>alkanes</b> (cyclic, linear, branched). Non-halogenated substances are highly branched alkanes and nitroaromatic compounds. Ten substances are high-production volume chemicals and 249 are pre-registered in the EU. We used uncertainty ranges of the chemical property data to estimate a lower and upper bound of the number of potential POPs; these bounds are at 190 and 1 200 chemicals. These results imply that several tens of potential POPs may have to be expected for future evaluation under the Stockholm Convention...|$|R
40|$|Hydrofluorocarbons {{have been}} {{proposed}} as CFC and HCFC substitutes since 1987, after the Montreal Protocol, {{with the aim of}} decreasing the ozone depletion. At present, these compounds are industrially produced by reaction of chlorinated hydrocarbons with HF. Environmental concerns have been raised regarding such processes, due to the co-production of huge amounts of HCl and the possible generation of dioxins and chlorinated compounds [1]. Due to their contribution to the greenhouse effect, <b>fluorinated</b> <b>alkanes</b> have often been replaced by other materials (e. g., natural refrigerants) in several UE countries [1, 2]. On the other hand, fluorinated olefins are used as intermediates for fluorinated polymers. A growing effort is currently being performed to set out cleaner processes for these latter compounds. To achieve an environmentally sustainable process, a possible alternative for fluorinated alkenes synthesis is the reaction of olefins with fluorinated solids. In particular, perovskites-type materials with composition (AgF) (MF_y) _x, were reported to be active catalysts in ethylene and propylene oxyfluorination [3]. However, the synthesis of the perovskite-type mixed fluoride [4, 5] leads to the formation of other compounds, such as metal oxides or reduced metals (i. e., Ag^ 0). For this reason, we tried to improve previous results with the aim of optimizing the catalyst synthesis. This work deals with the synthesis of AgCuF_ 3 by i) solid state reaction between commercial fluorides, in a HF flow, and ii) fluorination with HF of an oxohydrate obtained by metal nitrates co-precipitation. These compounds were also characterized by catalytic reactivity tests. As the re-oxidation of the reduced catalyst and the completion of the catalytic cycle was hindered by the presence of metallic Ag, we also investigated the possibility to synthesize mixed perovskite-like structures starting from fluorides of Ce(IV), Fe(III), Ag(I) and Cu(II) ...|$|R

30|$|In {{the last}} 20  years, {{the use of}} organic Rankine cycle instead of a simple Rankine cycle has been {{considered}} The operating ORC power plants around the world, with capacities ranging from 200  kW to 130  MW, demonstrate special attention to this technology. This cycle uses heat sources with low temperatures (100 – 500  °C). The ORC cycle works based on the simple Rankine cycle; however, to work with organic fluids, some changes must be applied. Organic working fluid in the ORC could be selected from the hydrocarbons; however, inorganic materials such as silicon and refrigeration fluids can also be used. ORC technology is significantly used in waste heat recycling of waste heat from gas turbines and it has significant advantages compared to classical heat regenerator system using a conventional Rankine cycle [12, 19]. A great deal of {{research has been done}} in the field of organic Rankine cycle. Yamamato et al. [23] examined an organic Rankine cycle using HCFC- 123 as a working fluid and concluded that this system has a better performance compared to using water as the working fluid [23]. Liu et al. [10] studied the effects of different working fluid on thermal and heat regenerator efficiencies. It showed that the wet fluid is inappropriate for ORC systems [10]. Wei et al. [22] studied the analysis and optimization of organic Rankine cycle using (1, 1, 1, 3, 3 penta-fluoro-propane) HFC-FA 245 as the working fluid. The results showed that the use of the output heat is a good solution to improve the system efficiency and net output power. The condenser outlet cooling degree should be small (0.5 – 0.6  K). When the ambient temperature is high, system output power and efficiency was reduced about 30 % from the nominal value. [22]. Saleh et al. [16] examined 31 fluids for the organic Rankine cycle operations in extremely low temperature and pressure, based on backbone relationship. Fluids include: <b>alkanes,</b> <b>fluorinated</b> <b>alkanes,</b> <b>fluorinated</b> ethers, and esters. Cycles operated between 30 and 100  °C in geothermal power plants under pressures limited to 20 Bar; however, in some cases, the supercritical pressures are considered. The thermal efficiency of operating fluids R 125 and C 5 F 12, is 2.3 and 10.5 %, respectively [16]. Tchanche et al. [18] analyzed the thermodynamic characteristics and functions of 20 fluids in the solar ORCs, in low temperature, and suggested R 134 a as the best fluid [18].|$|R
