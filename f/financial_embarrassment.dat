25|$|Macaulay was Secretary to the Board of Control under Lord Grey from 1832 until 1833. The <b>financial</b> <b>embarrassment</b> of {{his father}} meant that Macaulay became the sole means of support for his family and needed a more remunerative post than he could hold as an MP. After {{the passing of the}} Government of India Act 1833, he {{resigned}} as MP for Leeds and was appointed as the first Law Member of the Governor-General's Council. He went to India in 1834, and served on the Supreme Council of India between 1834 and 1838.|$|E
25|$|When in 1551 the {{mismanagement}} of Sir William Dansell, King's Merchant to the Low Countries, {{had caused the}} English Government much <b>financial</b> <b>embarrassment,</b> the authorities called Gresham for advice, thereafter following his proposals. Gresham advocated the adoption of various methods– highly ingenious, but quite arbitrary and unfair— for raising {{the value of the}} pound sterling on the bourse of Antwerp which proved so successful that {{in just a few years}} King Edward VI had discharged almost all of his debts. The Government sought Gresham's advice in all their money difficulties, and also frequently employed him in various diplomatic missions. He had no stated salary, but in reward of his services received from King Edward various grants of lands, the annual value of which at that time amounted ultimately to about 400 pounds a year.|$|E

Although {{in the eyes of}} the public he was a hero, the riches that Shackleton had anticipated failed to materialise. The soaring costs of the expedition and the need to meet loan guarantees meant that he was saved from <b>financial</b> <b>embarrassment</b> only by a belated government grant of £20,000.|$|E
2500|$|On September 5, 1788, the New Jersey Legislature gave Baron von Steuben {{full title}} to the former Zabriskie estate. A month later, {{recognizing}} his <b>financial</b> <b>embarrassment,</b> Steuben wrote another former aide-de-camp and companion, William North, recognizing: [...] "The jersey Estate must and is to be sold. Walker is my administrator, all debts are to be paid out of it." [...] On November6, 1788, Steuben again wrote North (at his new home in Duanesburg), noting [...] "My Jersey Estate is Advertised but not yet Sold, from this Walker Shall immediately pay to you the money, you so generously lend me and all my debts in New-York will be payed. I support my present poverty with more heroism than I Expected. All Clubs and parties are renounced, I seldom leave the House." [...] Steuben eventually sold the New Jersey property to a son of the previous owner, and it remained in the Zabriskie family until 1909. It is the only remaining eighteenth-century building that von Steuben owned.|$|E
2500|$|A new {{advocate}} for reform in Turkey has risen in Emin Arslan Effendi, the Consul General in Brussels. Last year {{he sent to}} Abdul Hamid a detailed report of the sufferings of the peasants in certain of the richest provinces in the empire. He pointed out that, unable to bear the heavy burden of taxation and the arbitrary methods of the farmers of revenue, they were cutting down their trees, tearing up their vines, leaving their lands uncultivated, and even emigrating in vast numbers beyond the seas. America alone, be said, contained more than 100,000 Syrian emigrants, a third of whom were Mohammedans. “Never {{in the history of}} Islam has such a thing occurred." [...] In this year’s report he dwells upon the great numbers of high officials and their enormous salaries. There are in the army, for instance, forty-four marshals, and forty-six viziers with the rank of marshal, and there are eighty members of the Council of State—as many as in France and Germany put together. Mukhtar Pasha's salary is four times as large as Lord Cromer's, and the Grand Vizier receives twice as much as Lord Salisbury. But “as the majority of these high officials receive from the Treasury double and sometimes treble their salaries, the <b>financial</b> <b>embarrassment</b> of the empire is but natural." ...|$|E

60|$|Whatever talent or genius the Pomeranian artist might possess, it {{certainly}} failed to receive commercial sanction. The portfolio remained bulky with unsold sketches, and the “Euston Siesta,” as the wits of the Nuremberg nicknamed the large canvas, {{was still in}} the market. The outward and visible signs of <b>financial</b> <b>embarrassment</b> began to be noticeable; the half-bottle of cheap claret at dinner-time gave way to a small glass of lager, and this in turn was displaced by water. The one-and-sixpenny set dinner receded from an everyday event to a Sunday extravagance; on ordinary days the artist contented himself with a sevenpenny omelette and some bread and cheese, and there were evenings when he did not put in an appearance at all. On the rare occasions when he spoke of his own affairs it was observed that he began to talk more about Pomerania and less about the great world of art.|$|E

His <b>financial</b> <b>embarrassment</b> still continued. His efforts to procure funds were only very partially successful. The people too, in all the region about Tarentum, were, he found, wholly alienated from him. They had not forgiven him for having left them to go to Sicily, and, in consequence of this abandonment of their cause, they had lost much of their confidence in him as their protector, while every thing like enthusiasm in his service was wholly gone. Through these and other causes, he encountered innumerable impediments in executing his plans, and his mind was harassed with continual disappointment and anxiety.|$|E

60|$|Finally in {{the summer}} of 1794 Robespierre himself was overthrown and guillotined.

Their reign formed a curious interlude in this history of violent changes. They took things {347} as they found them. The propagandist zeal of the revolution carried the French armies into Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, south Germany and north Italy. Everywhere kings were expelled and republics set up. But such propagandist zeal as animated the Directorate did not prevent the looting of the treasures of the liberated peoples to relieve the <b>financial</b> <b>embarrassment</b> of the French Government. Their wars became less and less the holy wars of freedom, and more and more like the aggressive wars of the ancient regime. The last feature of Grand Monarchy that France was disposed to discard was her tradition of foreign policy. One discovers it still as vigorous under the Directorate as if there had been no revolution.|$|E

60|$|In view of {{the actual}} <b>financial</b> <b>embarrassments</b> of the government, and of the greater embarrassment sure to come if the {{necessary}} means of relief be not afforded, I feel that I should not perform my duty by a simple announcement of my approval of the joint resolution, which proposes relief only by increased circulation, without expressing my earnest desire that measures such in substance as those I have just referred to may receive the early sanction of Congress.

He was also curious as to whether Tony was married yet, and {{would have liked to have}} heard that he was. That, he felt, would have snapped the last tie that bound him to the post, and made it easier to overcome the longing he was sensible of when he remembered Violet Wayne. It would, he fancied, be less difficult if he could think of her as Tony’s wife. Then he brushed away the fancies as Harper noisily moved his chair.|$|R
60|$|Sir Ernest Heavywether's {{speech in}} opening {{the case for}} the defence was not a long one, but it was backed by the full force of his {{emphatic}} manner. Never, he said, {{in the course of his}} long experience, had he known a charge of murder rest on slighter evidence. Not only was it entirely circumstantial, but the greater part of it was practically unproved. Let them take the testimony they had heard and sift it impartially. The strychnine had been found in a drawer in the prisoner's room. That drawer was an unlocked one, as he had pointed out, and he submitted that there was no evidence to prove that it was the prisoner who had concealed the poison there. It was, in fact, a wicked and malicious attempt on the part of some third person to fix the crime on the prisoner. The prosecution had been unable to produce a shred of evidence in support of their contention that it was the prisoner who ordered the black beard from Parkson's. The quarrel which had taken place between prisoner and his stepmother was freely admitted, but both it and his <b>financial</b> <b>embarrassments</b> had been grossly exaggerated.|$|R

6000|$|I {{have become}} {{impressed}} {{with the belief that}} the act approved March 2, 1867, entitled [...] "An act to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy throughout the United States," [...] is productive of more evil than good at this time. Many considerations might be urged for its total repeal, but, if this is not considered advisable, I think it will not be seriously questioned that those portions of said act providing for what is called involuntary bankruptcy operate to increase the <b>financial</b> <b>embarrassments</b> of the country. Careful and prudent men very often become involved in debt in the transaction of their business, and though they may possess ample property, if it could be made available for that purpose, to meet all their liabilities, yet, on account of the extraordinary scarcity of money, they may be unable to meet all their pecuniary obligations as they become due, in consequence of which they are liable to be prostrated in their business by proceedings in bankruptcy at the instance of unrelenting creditors. People are now so easily alarmed as to monetary matters that the mere filing of a petition in bankruptcy by an unfriendly creditor will necessarily embarrass, and oftentimes accomplish the financial ruin, of a responsible business man. Those who otherwise might make lawful and just arrangements to relieve themselves from difficulties produced by the present stringency in money are prevented by their constant exposure to attack and disappointment by proceedings against them in bankruptcy, and, besides, the law is made use of in many cases by obdurate creditors to frighten or force debtors into a compliance with their wishes and into acts of injustice to other creditors and to themselves. I recommend that so much of said act as provides for involuntary bankruptcy on account of the suspension of payment be repealed.|$|R
6000|$|The {{charge of}} raking, so {{repeatedly}} advanced in the foregoing lines, {{must be considered}} a sportive one, founded, perhaps, on an incident or two within Garrick's knowledge, but not {{borne out by the}} course of Goldsmith's life. He seems to have had a tender sentiment for the sex, but perfectly free from libertinism. Neither was he an habitual gamester. The strictest scrutiny has detected no settled vice of the kind. He was fond of a game of cards, but an unskillful and careless player. Cards in those days were universally introduced into society. High play was, in fact, a fashionable amusement, as at one time was deep drinking; and a man might occasionally lose large sums, and be beguiled into deep potations, without incurring the character of a gamester or a drunkard. Poor Goldsmith, on his advent into high society, assumed fine notions with fine clothes; he was thrown occasionally among high players, men of fortune who could sport their cool hundreds as carelessly as his early comrades at Ballymahon could their half crowns. Being at all times magnificent in money matters, he may have played with them in their own way, without considering that what was sport to them to him was ruin. Indeed part of his <b>financial</b> <b>embarrassments</b> may have arisen from losses of the kind, incurred inadvertently, not in the indulgence of a habit. [...] "I do not believe Goldsmith to have deserved the name of gamester," [...] said one of his contemporaries; [...] "he liked cards very well, as other people do, and lost and won occasionally; but as far as I saw or heard, and I had many opportunities of hearing, never any considerable sum. If he gamed with any one, it was probably with Beauclerc, but I do not know that such was the case." ...|$|R
60|$|Rex Dillot {{was nearly}} twenty-four, almost good-looking and quite penniless. His mother was {{supposed}} to make him some sort of an allowance out of what her creditors allowed her, and Rex occasionally strayed into the ranks of those who earn fitful salaries as secretaries or companions to people who are unable to cope unaided with their correspondence or their leisure. For a few months he had been assistant editor and business manager of a paper devoted to fancy mice, but the devotion had been all on one side, and the paper disappeared with a certain abruptness from club reading-rooms and other haunts where it had made a gratuitous appearance. Still, Rex lived with some air of comfort and well-being, as one can live if one is born with a genius for that sort of thing, and a kindly Providence usually arranged that his week-end invitations coincided with the dates on which his one white dinner-waistcoat was in a laundry-returned condition of dazzling cleanness. He played most games badly, and was shrewd enough to recognise the fact, but he had developed a marvellously accurate judgement in estimating the play and chances of other people, whether in a golf match, billiard handicap, or croquet tournament. By dint of parading his opinion of such and such a player’s superiority with a sufficient degree of youthful assertiveness he usually succeeded in provoking a wager at liberal odds, and he looked to his week-end winnings to carry him through the <b>financial</b> <b>embarrassments</b> of his mid-week existence. The trouble was, as he confided to Clovis Sangrail, that he never had enough available or even prospective cash at his command to enable him to fix the wager at a figure really worth winning.|$|R
