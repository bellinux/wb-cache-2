5|$|Invasive {{plants such}} as Crofton weed and Formosa lily occur in {{inaccessible}} areas and probably cannot be eradicated but others are currently being managed. In 1995 the first action was taken to control the spread of introduced plants of the island, chiefly ground asparagus and bridal creeper, but also cherry guava, Madeira vine, Cotoneaster, Ochna and Cestrum. This has been followed by weeding tours {{and the formation of}} the Friends of Lord Howe Island group in 2000. Programs have also been started to remove weeds from private properties and revegetate some formerly cultivated areas. An <b>Environmental</b> <b>Unit</b> was created by the Board and it includes a Flora Management Officer and a permanent Weed Officer. Weeds have been mapped and an eradication program is in place, supported by improved education and quarantine procedures.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to define {{homogeneous}} <b>environmental</b> <b>units,</b> inside a land planning model. A multivariate analysis of a number of elements of the biophysical environment of the area and of its accessibility was carried out by preparing and processing digital maps. Sixteen homogeneous <b>environmental</b> <b>units</b> were determined. The criteria used in defining these units on the ground was firstly the geomorphology of the area; secondly the physical characteristics, using slope and aspect; and thirdly the hydrography, in terms of the presence and availability of water. It is concluded that the model used is appropriate for the zone under study, since it helps in delimiting the <b>environmental</b> <b>units.</b> Finally, multivariate techniques are recommended for the treatment of territorial variables...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparison}} between direct field measurements and predictions of soil water erosion using two variant; (FAO and R/ 2 index) of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) {{was carried out}} in a microcatchment o 22. 32 km 2 in Northeastern Mexico. Direct field measurements were based on a geomorphologic classification of the area; while <b>environmental</b> <b>units</b> were defined for applying the equation. <b>Environmental</b> <b>units</b> were later grouped withir geomorphologic units to compare results. For the basin as a whole, erosion rates from FAO index were statistical!; equal to those measured on the field, while values obtained from the R/ 2 index were statistically different from the res and overestimated erosion. However, when comparing among geomorphologic units, erosion appeared overestimate! in steep units and underestimated in more flat areas. The most remarkable differences on erosion rates, between th(direct and FAO methods, were for those units where gullies have developed, fn these cases, erosion was underestimated by FAO index. Hence, it is suggested that a weighted factor for presence of gullies should be developed and included in RUSLE equation...|$|R

The compensation can be either or both in monetary and <b>environmental</b> <b>units</b> to meet three goals: i) minimization of the cost associated with the compensation, ii) no aggregate welfare loss, iii) minimal environmental compensation requirement. The findings suggest that-in some cases- providing both monetary and environmental compensation can be the cost-minimizing option. Minimal compensation constraints can increase total compensation costs but reduce individual gains and losses relative to the initial situation tha...|$|R
