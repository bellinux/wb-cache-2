The factors affecting the colour generation were optimized and incorporated in the procedure. The reacted propofol has a molar absorptivity of 3. 9 × 10 – 4 l/mol cm, and Beer's law is obeyed for concentrations 1 - 5 µg/ml with detection limit 0. 25 µg/ml. The method was found applicable to biological fluids (plasma and urine) spiked with propofol at concentration levels 1 - 5 µg/ml for plasma and 1 - 5 µg/ 0. 5 ml urine (less sensitivity is obtained with urine volumes above 0. 5 ml) with detection limits 0. 28 µg/ml for plasma and 0. 4 µg 0. 5 ml urine. The average recovery for the commercial preparation (1 % w/v propofol <b>emulsion</b> intravenous <b>injection</b> <b>for</b> infusion) was 99. 54 % with an RSD of 1. 05 %.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop radiopaque iodinated <b>emulsions</b> <b>for</b> use as CT blood pool contrast agents. Three hydrophobic iodinated oils were synthesized based on the 2, 3, 5 -triiodobenzoate moiety and formulated into emulsions using either phospholipids or amphiphilic polymers, i. e.

While the lipid-stabilized emulsions turned out unstable in vivo, polymer-stabilized emulsions performed well in vivo. In blood, a contrast enhancement of 220 Hounsfield Units (HU) was measured directly after intravenous administration of 520 mg I/kg.

Particle size mean of emulsion droplets/hardened microparticles were monitored by focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM). Encapsulation efficiency (EE) and in vitro drug release in phosphate buffer (pH 7. 4) were also investigated. The results showed that the resulting microparticle blends obtained by solvent evaporation method were spherical and having two populations.
