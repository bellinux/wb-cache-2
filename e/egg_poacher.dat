5000|$|Malley's {{parents are}} alarmed, {{even more so}} when the police {{discover}} that the name of Malley's friend, [...] "Talbo Chock", actually belongs to a soldier killed in Afghanistan, meaning Malley's new friend is an identity thief, and probably much worse. Richard is frantic, but after Skink has dealt with the turtle <b>egg</b> <b>poacher,</b> he announces that his next [...] "project" [...] is to track Malley down and bring her home safe, and he invites Richard to come along. Since the police have had no success in tracing Malley's whereabouts, Richard agrees, tricking his mother and stepfather into believing he is going camping with a friend.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "poaching" [...] is {{used for}} this method but is {{actually}} incorrect. The egg is placed in a cup and suspended over simmering water, using a special pan called an [...] "egg-poacher". This is usually a wide-bottomed pan with an inner lid, with holes containing a number of circular cups that each hold one egg, with an additional lid over the top. To cook, the pan is filled with water and brought to a simmer, or a gentle boil. The outer lid holds in the steam, ensuring that the heat surrounds the egg completely. The cups are often lubricated with butter in order to effect easy removal of the cooked egg, although non-stick <b>egg</b> <b>poachers</b> are also available.|$|R
500|$|Prompted by {{the death}} of Mora, dozens of environmentalists met with the Ministry of Environment, Energy and Telecommunications (MINAE), headed by René Castro, to discuss their dissatisfaction with current {{conservation}} efforts on June 4. Their requests included punishing those responsible for Mora's death, greater criminal penalties for poaching, and more efforts by MINAE to fight <b>egg</b> <b>poachers.</b> [...] Castro suggested implementing a plan submitted by WIDECAST. The plan would give park rangers jurisdiction to arrest poachers on Moín Beach and create a code of conduct for beach visitors nationwide. It would also increase penalties for poaching, name a new protected area after Mora, and set up a memorial fund in his name. The proposal was initially met with enthusiasm, but it later gave way to complaints about lax environmental enforcement nationwide. [...] "This isn’t only happening in Moín and this not only happening with turtle conservation," [...] remarked Molina. Deputy Minister of Security Celso Gamboa, who was also in attendance, promised to increase security forces in Limón.|$|R
50|$|Several Caribbean {{countries}} started conservation programs, {{such as the}} St. Kitts Sea Turtle Monitoring Network, {{focused on}} using ecotourism to highlight the leatherback's plight. On the Atlantic coast of Costa Rica, the village of Parismina has one such initiative. Parismina is an isolated sandbar where {{a large number of}} leatherbacks lay <b>eggs,</b> but <b>poachers</b> abound. Since 1998, the village has been assisting turtles with a hatchery program. The Parismina Social Club is a charitable organization backed by American tourists and expatriates, which collects donations to fund beach patrols. Mayumba National Park in Gabon, Central Africa, was created to protect Africa's most important nesting beach. More than 30,000 turtles nest on Mayumba's beaches between September and April each year.|$|R
50|$|Albina has a {{small boat}} (korjaal) {{connection}} to Galibi. The journey across the water takes about 1.5 hrs. There is a beach and a small tourist shop. The main reason tourists visit Galibi is to see the turtles, which {{come from all over}} the world (including places as distant as Costa Rica and Australia) to lay their <b>eggs</b> in Suriname. <b>Poachers</b> also come, to collect the eggs to sell them on the market.|$|R
5000|$|By the mid 1970s {{the product}} line showed a {{complete}} {{shift away from}} toys and included the Empire line of electric coffee makers and party urns, slow cookers, electric kettles, pop-corn poppers, <b>egg</b> cookers and <b>poachers,</b> hot cups, travel kits, Lady Aristette hair dryers, and the combination Kar 'N Home kits. [...] The line of metal toys was dropped in the mid 1960s due to increasing federal safety regulations. New products introduced in 1977 included the Little Fry mini deep fryer and the Empire Travl-Mate automatic coffee maker kit.|$|R
