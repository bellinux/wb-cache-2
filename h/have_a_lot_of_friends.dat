2500|$|On {{either side}} of Number 37 are Lilla Hoparegränd ("Smaller Heaper's Alley", a {{corruption}} of [...] "Hoper's Alley", e.g. hooper indicating a profession, 'maker of barrels') and Pelikansgränd ("Pelican's Alley"), both forking off from Gaffelgränd ("Fork alley"). [...] While the building is standing on a medieval wall, the façade is from the 18th century, and the portal from the 17th century. [...] The latter was probably cut by Johan Wendelstam, a German sculptor who arrived to Stockholm in 1641 to become the Guild Master within a few years, and also cut one of the portals on Stortorget. [...] The client was apparently Dutch as the inscription on the gable stone reads: Gaet het wel men heeft veel vrinden kert het luck wie kan se vinden ("When luck stands by one <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends,</b> but when luck turns where are they then?"). [...] Behind the front door is an entrance hall featuring a richly profiled sandstone column carrying a cross-vault. [...] The façade of Number 24 dates back to 1862, the shutters and wooden panels from that time however replaced by the rough-cast plaster probably in 1945, and the windows enlarged since. [...] The rusticated façade of Number 26 {{dates back to the}} enlargement in 1846, {{at the time it was}} however perfectly symmetric, a balance manipulated in 1973 when the enlarged opening and wooden panel of the restaurant entrance was added. [...] The northern door, still featuring some original details, gives a fair impression of what the façade looked like in the 19th century. [...] The façade of Number 28, arguably one of the oldest still existent residential properties in Stockholm, is mostly from 1874 with some details replaced in 1969.|$|E
