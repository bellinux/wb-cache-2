5|$|The episode makes {{references}} to Family Guy itself. When Bonnie, Lois and Cleveland's new girlfriend come to dance at The Drunken Clam, they state {{that they would}} like to make the bar their place to hang out, after Peter grabs Joe's gun and kills himself. It turns out that this was only Peter's imagination as he snaps out of it when Joe starts talking to him; Peter answers that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> Scrubs fantasy moment. Quagmire responds to Peter's moment by stating that Scrubs is the best show people are not watching. Cleveland replies that he hates shows that leave the story for a gag or joke, referring to the numerous cutaways Scrubs and Family Guy contain. While in the hospital Peter realizes that Mr. Pewterschmidt and Dr. Hartman have a similar voice, then Mr. Pewterschmidt comes into the room and they both start talking about how their voices sound alike; this is a reference to the show's creator Seth MacFarlane as he voices both characters.|$|E

25|$|In 1964, Hoover's FBI {{investigated}} Jack Valenti, {{a special}} assistant and confidant of President Lyndon Johnson's. Despite Valenti's two-year marriage to Johnson's personal secretary, the investigation focused on rumors that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> gay relationship with a commercial photographer friend.|$|E

25|$|Others, {{including}} Cesarani, {{claim that}} Koestler had misogynistic tendencies. He engaged in numerous sexual affairs and generally treated {{the women in}} his life badly.

25|$|In 1978 {{the film}} Nameless Star (an {{adaptation}} of Mihail Sebastian's play) was premiered on Soviet TV. The film's director (and also a well-known actor) Mikhail Kozakov gave Vertinskaya (with whom <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> passionate love affair at the time) total freedom of improvisation, letting the two – Mona {{the character and}} Anastasiya the performer – almost merge. The film (where her partner was Igor Kostolevsky) remained one of Vertinskaya's all time favorites. The officials, however, disliked it.|$|E
25|$|Wiles {{states that}} {{on the morning of}} 19 September 1994, he {{was on the verge of}} giving up and was almost {{resigned}} to accepting that he had failed, and to publishing his work so that others could build on it and find the error. He adds that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> final look to try and understand the fundamental reasons why his approach could not be made to work, when he had a sudden insight that the specific reason why the Kolyvagin–Flach approach would not work directly also meant that his original attempts using Iwasawa theory could be made to work, if he strengthened it using his experience gained from the Kolyvagin–Flach approach. Fixing one approach with tools from the other approach would resolve the issue for all the cases that were not already proven by his refereed paper. He described later that Iwasawa theory and the Kolyvagin–Flach approach were each inadequate on their own, but together they could be made powerful enough to overcome this final hurdle.|$|E

Tania, a young woman from Weaver's Peak, insists that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> bad dream and introduces herself as his sister.|$|E
500|$|Morris had {{considered}} filming the Australian scenes in South Africa {{due to the}} comparatively high costs in Australia, which despite a higher budget caused the sequel to have fewer resources than its predecessor. While all locations for the first film had been within 10 minutes of the hotel, locations in the second were separated by a three-hour flight and nine-hour car journey. During filming in the Outback, the Australian crew provided two doctors and 40 litres of IV fluid, although the only point in which a doctor was called was when Buckley thought that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> heart attack, which was in reality indigestion from chips and lager. Beesley considered it [...] "the maniac's choice of a film to be your first film". The water park scenes were filmed at Wet'n'Wild Gold Coast, which Thomas described as [...] "some quite challenging scenes".|$|E
500|$|Klowden {{recalled}} {{later that}} [...] "he was very {{down in the}} dumps about his wife. [...] He told me how he had met Northrup. He said {{he went to a}} party and got drunk and when he {{woke up in the morning}} he found Northrup was in bed with him. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> lot of problems with her. I remember he said to me I was the only person he knew who would set up a white silk tent for him. I was rather surprised when we were driving back to LA on Sunday evening, he stopped at a florist to buy some flowers for his wife." [...] In November 1950, Northrup attempted suicide by taking sleeping pills. Hubbard blamed Klowden for the suicide bid and told her to forget about him and the Foundation, but resumed the affair with her again within a month.|$|E

500|$|Don awakens to a {{knock on}} the door. It's Andrea, still in her tight yellow dress. Don directs her to leave {{immediately}} and forces her to go out through the apartment's service elevator. After Don returns to bed, Andrea walks into his bedroom again, having entered through the unlocked back door. She seduces Don and the two end up having sex in his bed. In a post-coital moment, Andrea declares to Don that he will continue meeting her for trysts because he can't change who he is. Don flies off the handle and chokes her to death. Panicking, he kicks her under the bed, but one of her red shoes remains visible, recalling both the visual of Ginsberg's Cinderella pitch and the lone survivor from the Richard Speck murders. Don awakens the next morning to realize <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> fever dream. He says nothing of his vision to Megan and tells her she doesn't need to worry about him.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{performed}} [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna" [...] {{during her}} appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on April 9, 2015. She adorned {{herself in a}} black jacket covered with gold dollar symbols {{and a number of}} gold chains around her neck. The performance began with Madonna in the backstage where she put finishing touches to her make-up, then entered Diplo's dressing room where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> party surrounded by women. Madonna did a dance routine in the hallway where her son Rocco appeared mouthing the chorus. The singer and her troupe then moved into the studio area where the audience was present. Energetic dancing continued with Madonna straddling one member of the audience at one point. Still photos of Minaj were projected on video screens with Diplo DJing on a console. Madonna also climbed atop Fallon's desk and made him sing the chorus line. The performance ended with another energetic dance routine and crumping.|$|E
500|$|Two new employees, Clark Green (Clark Duke) and Pete Miller (Jake Lacy), who {{are quickly}} dubbed [...] "Dwight, Jr." [...] and [...] "The New Jim," [...] are {{hired by the}} Scranton branch and cause trouble for Jim and Dwight. At first, Dwight is {{happy to have a}} protégé, acting as a fatherly figure to Clark due to the office noting their visual similarity, but soon begins to fear that Clark is after his job. Jim, on the other hand, does not feel that Pete is {{anything}} like him. However, after hearing Pete discuss his future plans, Jim realizes that he used to have Pete's ambition but has become stuck at the same job for over nine years. [...] Meanwhile, Angela puts one of her cats, Comstock, up for adoption as her baby is allergic to it. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) initially refuses to adopt Comstock despite Angela's pleas, but agrees to adopt it after learning that it is her husband Robert's (Jack Coleman) favorite cat. It is implied that Robert and Oscar are having an affair, as Robert told Angela <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> business dinner on the night he actually had plans with Oscar.|$|E

500|$|The {{first week}} of {{recording}} produced [...] "Go", [...] "Blood", [...] "Rats", and [...] "Leash" [...] before the band hit a lull. In order to keep up his intensity, Vedder traveled into San Francisco and began sleeping in his truck, {{as well as the}} sauna at the recording studio. Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "Recording Vs., {{there was a lot more}} pressure on Ed. The whole follow-up. I thought we were playing so well as a band that it would take care of itself... <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> hard time finishing up the songs; the pressure, and not being comfortable being in such a nice place." [...] Ament added that [...] "toward the end it got fairly intense" [...] and that the band [...] "tried to make it as uncomfortable for [...] as we could." [...] Eventually the band was able to get [...] "back on track" [...] according to Ament as Vedder was allowed [...] "to get in the space of his songs." [...] The album was finished in May 1993. Vedder later said, [...] "The second record, that was the one I enjoyed making the least... I just didn't feel comfortable in the place we were at because it was very comfortable. I didn't like that at all." ...|$|E
500|$|His {{family moved}} often {{as his father}} worked at jobs along the West Coast, {{although}} they did not move at all between 1940 and 1949. Settled in Piedmont, California, the Eastwoods lived in a very wealthy part of town, had a swimming pool, belonged to the country club, and each parent drove their own car. Clint attended Piedmont Junior High School. Shortly before he was to enter Piedmont High School, he rode his bike on the school's sports field and tore up the wet turf; this resulted in his being asked not to enroll. Instead, he attended Oakland Technical High School, where he was held back due to poor academic scores and scheduled to graduate in January 1949 as a midyear graduate, {{although it is not}} clear if he ever did. [...] "Clint graduated from the airplane shop. I think that was his major," [...] joked classmate Don Kincade. Another high school friend, Don Loomis, echoed [...] "I don't think he was spending that much time at school because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> pretty good time elsewhere." [...] "I think what happened is he just went off and started having a good time. I just don't think he finished high school," [...] explained Fritz Manes, a boyhood friend two years younger than Eastwood, who remained associated with him until their falling out in the mid-1980s. Biographer Patrick McGilligan notes that high school graduation records are a matter of strict legal confidentiality.|$|E
500|$|On 20 April 1972, Sellers {{reunited with}} Milligan and Harry Secombe to record The Last Goon Show of All, which was {{broadcast}} on 5 October. In May 1973, with his third marriage failing, Sellers {{went to the}} theatre to watch Liza Minnelli perform. He became entranced with Minnelli and the couple became engaged three days later, despite Minnelli's current betrothal to Desi Arnaz, Jr., and Sellers still being married. Their relationship lasted a month before breaking up. By 1974, Sellers's friends were concerned that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> nervous breakdown. Directors John and Roy Boulting considered that Sellers was [...] "a deeply troubled man, distrustful, self-absorbed, ultimately self-destructive. He was the complete contradiction." [...] Sellers was shy and insecure when out of character. When {{he was invited to}} appear on Michael Parkinson's eponymous chat show in 1974, he withdrew the day before, explaining to Parkinson that [...] "I just can't walk on as myself". When he was told he could come on as someone else, he appeared dressed {{as a member of the}} Gestapo. After a few lines in keeping with his assumed character, he stepped out of the role and settled down and, according to Parkinson himself, [...] "was brilliant, giving the audience an astonishing display of his virtuosity". In 1974, Sellers again claimed to have communicated with the long-dead music hall comic Dan Leno, who advised him to return to the role of Clouseau.|$|E

500|$|As {{the three}} summer interns prepare to depart, Michael (Steve Carell) hears from {{various members of}} the office that two of the interns might be dating, and feels upset that he was left out of the gossip. He talks about the {{situation}} with the third intern, and learns that the interns had recently gone out to a young people's club, where they saw Stanley (Leslie David Baker) dancing with a woman, presumably his wife Teri. Michael, wanting to start some gossip of his own, forms the conclusion that Stanley was out because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> mid-life crisis and shares it with the office, but Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) claims Stanley does not like crowds and that Teri is out of town. When Michael confronts the interns about this, they insist they saw Stanley there [...] "making out" [...] with a woman. Now realizing that Stanley is possibly having an affair and he is the first person to learn of it, Michael starts telling the employees. Jim (John Krasinski) urges Michael to stop spreading a rumor that he does not know for certain to be true. When Stanley is leaving, Michael heads to the parking lot to discuss the rumor with him. Stanley initially denies it, but when Michael mentions that he was spotted in the club by the interns, he reveals that since Teri has been out of town constantly, he has been seeking company from a nurse named Cynthia, whom he met in rehab. Stanley urges Michael not to say anything since he is breaking it off with Cynthia, and Michael agrees, despite having already told the entire office.|$|E
