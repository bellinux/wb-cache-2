[...] One formation mechanism proposed by Quinn and Ehlmann in 2017 was that sediment was deposited and eventually the sediment underwent diagenesis which caused a loss of volume and fractures. After erosion exposed the fractures, they were filled with minerals possibly by acid-sulfate fluids. More erosion removed softer materials and left the more resistant ridges behind.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the field descriptions and microscopic observations of a tectonic breccia {{in the basement}} gneiss of the Cabo Frio and Arraial do Cabo areas, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and its intrusive contact with the Early Cretaceous mafic dyke. At the sea cliff close to the Ilha do Japonês, there is an excellent contact outcrop between them. The tectonic breccia zone is 10 to 20 m wide and has N 30 ºE direction. The breccia clasts are angular and characterized by auto-brecciation texture, and composed of breccia with similar aspect of the host tectonic breccia. The matrix is firmly consolidated by <b>hydrothermalism</b> and following silicification. The mafic dyke is 7 to 10 m wide and of N 45 ºE direction. Along the contact, the dyke chilled margin featured by fine-grained basalt and prismatic joints can be observed. At the Conchas Beach and Arraial do Cabo city, there are four outcrops demonstrating the mafic dyke intrusion into the consolidated tectonic breccias. These outcrops prove that the tectonic breccias are older than the Early Cretaceous tholeiitic dykes. The fault breccias could have been formed during the brittle-phase tectonism of the last stage of the Pan-African Orogeny by <b>hydrothermalism</b> without magmatic activities, namely tectonic <b>hydrothermalism.</b> The existence of the clasts constituent of the breccia that are composed of breccia suggests that the fault movement and following <b>hydrothermalism</b> occurred repeatedly...|$|E

40|$|Observations {{and models}} of Ceres suggest that its {{evolution}} {{was shaped by}} interactions between liquid water and silicate rock. Hydrothermal processes in a heated core require both fractured rock and liquid. Using a new core cracking model coupled to a thermal evolution code, we find volumes of fractured rock always large enough for significant interaction to occur. Therefore, liquid persistence is key. It is favored by antifreezes such as ammonia, by silicate dehydration which releases liquid, and by hydrothermal circulation itself, which enhances heat transport into the hydrosphere. The effect of heating from silicate hydration seems minor. Hydrothermal circulation can profoundly affect Ceres' evolution: it prevents core dehydration via “temperature resets,” core cooling events lasting ∼ 50 Myr during which Ceres' interior temperature profile becomes very shallow and its hydrosphere is largely liquid. Whether Ceres has experienced such extensive <b>hydrothermalism</b> may be determined through examination of its present-day structure. A large, fully hydrated core (radius 420 km) would suggest that extensive hydrothermal circulation prevented core dehydration. A small, dry core (radius 350 km) suggests early dehydration from short-lived radionuclides, with shallow <b>hydrothermalism</b> at best. Intermediate structures with a partially dehydrated core seem ambiguous, compatible both with late partial dehydration without hydrothermal circulation, and with early dehydration with extensive hydrothermal circulation. Thus, gravity measurements by the Dawn orbiter, whose arrival at Ceres is imminent, could help discriminate between scenarios for Ceres' evolution...|$|E
40|$|Biological carbon {{fixation}} {{is limited by}} the supply of Fe in vast regions of the global ocean. Dissolved Fe in seawater is primarily sourced from continental mineral dust, submarine <b>hydrothermalism,</b> and sediment dissolution along continental margins. However, the relative contributions of these three sources to the Fe budget of the open ocean remains contentious. By exploiting the Fe stable isotopic fingerprints of these sources, it is possible to trace distinct Fe pools through marine environments, and through time using sedimentary records. We present a reconstruction of deep-sea Fe isotopic compositions from a Pacific Fe−Mn crust spanning the past 76 My. We find that there have been large and systematic changes in the Fe isotopic composition of seawater over the Cenozoic that reflect the influence of several, distinct Fe sources to the central Pacific Ocean. Given that deeply sourced Fe from <b>hydrothermalism</b> and marginal sediment dissolution exhibit the largest Fe isotopic variations in modern oceanic settings, the record requires that these deep Fe sources have exerted a major control over the Fe inventory of the Pacific for the past 76 My. The persistence of deeply sourced Fe in the Pacific Ocean illustrates that multiple sources contribute to the total Fe budget of the ocean and highlights the importance of oceanic circulation in determining if deeply sourced Fe is ever ventilated at the surface...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTropical {{volcanic}} islands commonly have pronounced {{relief and}} high runoff rates, and consist of easily weathered volcanic material. Intense mechanical and chemical weathering in volcanic terrains {{has been recognized}} as being an important component in the transport of the global dissolved load to the oceans [1]. High chemical weathering rates are mainly due {{to the impact of}} <b>hydrothermalism</b> inputs with subsurface water circulations [2]. A helicopter-borne TDEM (Time Domain ElectroMagnestism) and magnetic survey was conducted by BRGM (French Geological Survey) over 3 islands of Guadeloupe, Martinique and Reunion in 2012 and 2013 for a total of 20, 000 km of flightlines. TDEM method uses the diffusion of a transient EM field to determine the electrical resistivity versus depth. Erosion timescales were calculated from U-series analyses of river sediments. Our results show a broad range: 0 to 150 ka in Martinique, 0 to 60 ka in Guadeloupe and 55 to 90 ky for Piton de la Fournaise (Réunion). At watershed scale, the estimated weathered profile (WP) depth obtain by using U-series method are consistent with TDEM helicopter-borne geophysical imagery method, ranging from 0 to 70 m. WP are locally impacted by hydrothermal circulations with associated secondary minerals (halloysite, tridymite…). Among the combined impact of all parameters (climate, runoff, slopes, <b>hydrothermalism</b> inputs, vegetation etc.), basin age seems to be the key control parameter: the younger the basin, the higher the weathering rate is...|$|E
40|$|Clay {{minerals}} {{have been}} identified in the central peaks and ejecta blankets of impact craters on Mars. Several studies have suggested these clay minerals formed as a result of impact induced <b>hydrothermalism</b> either during Mars' Noachian era or more recently by the melting of subsurface ice. Examples of post-impact clay formation is found in several locations on Earth such as the Mjolnir and Woodleigh Impact Structures. Additionally, a recent study has suggested the clay minerals observed on Ceres are the result of impact-induced hydrothermal processes. Such processes may have occurred on Mars, possibly during the Noachian. Distinguishing between clay minerals formed preor post-impact can be accomplished by studying their IR spectra. In fact, showed that the IR spectra of clay minerals is greatly affected at longer wavelengths (i. e. mid-IR, 5 - 25 micron) by impact-induced shock deformation while the near-IR spectra (1. 0 - 2. 5 micron) remains relatively unchanged. This explains the discrepancy between NIR and MIR observations of clay minerals in martian impact craters noted. Thus, it allows us to determine whether a clay mineral formed from impact-induced <b>hydrothermalism</b> or were pre-existing and were altered by the impact. Here we study the role of impacts on the formation and distribution of clay minerals on Mars via a fully 3 -D Monte Carlo cratering model, including impact- melt production using results from modern hydrocode simulations. We identify regions that are conducive to clay formation and the location of clay minerals post-bombardment...|$|E
40|$|The role {{of methane}} {{in the global}} bio-geo-system {{is one of the}} most {{important}} issues of present-day research. Phenomena like gas hydrates and associated fluid vents provide valuable evidence of subsurface methane paths. The cruise SO 191 - 1 (Jan. 2007) on RV Sonne was dedicated to the investigation of local and regional transport processes of methane and facies characterisation of cold vents and gas hydrate deposits east of New Zealand. The eastern coast of New Zealand is shaped by intensive compressional tectonics, which is related to the subduction of the Pacific plate under the Australian Plate. Active volcanism, <b>hydrothermalism</b> and seismic activity accompany the subduction. Several cold vent locations as well as an extensive BSR indicating the presence of gas hydrates have been found at the Hikurangi Plateau, an accretionary complex offshore eastern North Island. The close proximity to <b>hydrothermalism</b> is likely to have an influence on the fluid genesis and composition and an interrelation of hot and cold venting is expected. This makes the Hikurangi Plateau a unique study area for coupled gas hydrate and fluid vent methane cycles. We present data collected during the cruise SO 191 - 1, including bathymetric data of the study area, high resolution seismics and side scan sonar (deep towed), which image in great detail the various fluid escape structures, the bottom simulating reflector (BSR) extent and its properties.

The matrix permeability of igneous rocks is generally small and, consequently, the global permeability is mostly controlled by the fault and fracture networks.

Thus, this section has been chosen [Schmitz et al., 2011] as a stratotype of Selandian basal and terminal limits (GSSP: Global boundary Stratotype Section and Point). The sediments consist of carbonate hemipelagites interbedded with fine carbonate (Maastrichtian to Selandian) and siliciclastic (Thanetian to Eocene) turbidites. The purpose of this work is to geochemically characterize the Selandian by trace element contents (strontium and manganese) and to try to assess the chemical composition of seawater during the Paleocene. Analysis of various separated granulometric fine fractions show that hemipelagic sediments from the Zumaia section present a high preservation quality of the original records of trace-element contents. Late burial diagenesis plays only a minor role and geochemical breaks are not reducible to a change in the nature of carbonate producers. The strontium contents of Paleocene sediments require that the Sr/Ca ratio of seawater was lower than that in the present ocean. The Selandian is characterized by a positive excursion of the strontium curve. This accident is also recognized in several worldwide sections and is related to the platform/basin carbonate sedimentation budget and the intensity of oceanic <b>hydrothermalism.</b> The Mn content of hemipelagites is very high and can reach 2500 – 3000 ppm in the Paleocene. A comparison of analyses by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) shows that both Mn 2 + (in the calcite lattice) and Mn 4 + (as oxide micro nodules) coexist. The Mn content fluctuations are related to the opening phases of the North Atlantic during the Paleocene by submarine volcanism and <b>hydrothermalism</b> in the North Atlantic Igneous Province (NAIP) ...|$|E

We report a geochemical {{investigation of a}} short (22 cm) near-vent hydrothermal metalliferous sediment core from the Lucky Strike site (LS), on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). The sediment was collected {{from the base of}} an active white smoker vent and comprises pure hydrothermal precipitates, mainly chalcopyrite, sphalerite, pyrite and barite, with negligible detrital and biogenic inputs. Geochemically, the core is enriched in elements derived from high-temperature <b>hydrothermalism</b> (Fe, Cu, Zn and Ba) and depleted in elements derived from low-temperature <b>hydrothermalism</b> (Mn), and metasomatism (Mg). The U/Fe content ratio is elevated, particularly in the deeper parts of the core, consistent with uptake from seawater associated with sulphide alteration. Rare earth elements (REE) concentrations are low and chondrite-normalized patterns are characteristic of hightemperature vent fluids with an enrichment in light REE and a pronounced positive Eu anomaly. A stronger positive Eu anomaly associated with higher Lan/Smn at the core top is controlled by barite precipitation. The hydrothermal influence on the REE decreases downcore with some evidence for a stronger seawater influence at depth. Nd isotopes also exhibit an increased detrital/ seawater influence downcore. Pb isotope ratios are uniform and plot on the Northern Hemisphere Reference Line in a small domain defined by LS basalts and exhibit no detrital or seawater influence. Lucky Strike sediments are derived from high-temperature mineralization and are overprinted by a weak seawater–sediment interaction when compared with other Atlantic hydrothermal sites such as TAG. The larger seawater input and/or a larger detrital contribution in deeper layers can be explained by variable hydrothermal activity during sediment formation, suggesting different pulses in activity of the LS hydrothermal system...|$|E

About 155, 000 detected aftershocks occurred in a network of orthogonal faults and exhibit features of two distinct mechanisms for aftershock triggering. The earliest aftershocks were likely driven by afterslip that spread away from the mainshock with the logarithm of time. A later pulse of aftershocks swept again across the Yuha Desert with square-root time dependence and swarm-like behavior; together with local geological evidence for <b>hydrothermalism,</b> these features suggest the events were driven by fluid diffusion. The observations illustrate how multiple driving mechanisms and the underlying fault structure jointly control the evolution of an aftershock sequence...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Several decades {{dedicated}} {{to the study of}} Mars has enabled scientists to understand that, during its history, environmental conditions on early Mars strongly contrasted with the present-day conditions, hostile for life. Indeed, previous (Mars Express, Viking…) and more recent (MSL) missions confirmed that liquid water, heat (volcan-ism, <b>hydrothermalism),</b> organic matter, and redox conditions probably occurred on the planet, thus enabling scientists to seriously consider early Mars as being habitable ans suitable for the emergence of Martian life [1]. However, the detection of past life on Mars, if it existed, also requires that biomarkers (i) be preserved over geological time scales and that (ii) they remained detectable. Therefore, as terrestrial analogues for Mars, astrobiologists are addressing questions related to microbial adaptation, lifestyles and survival in extraterrestrial environments [2].

Compared with today, internal Earth heat production was several times greater resulting in high geothermal flux that induced the genesis of rocks such as komatiites and TTG suites, which are no more generated on Earth since 2. 5 Ga. Similarly, the details of plate tectonic modalities (plate size, plate motion rate, plate thickness, tectonic style, irregular crustal growth, etc [...] .) were different of modern plate tectonics. Both atmosphere and ocean compositions have been progressively modified and the greater heat production favoured the development of <b>hydrothermalism</b> and therefore created niches potentially favourable {{for the development of}} some forms of life. Catastrophic events such as giant meteorite falls or world-sized glaciations drastically and suddenly changed the environment of Earth surface, thus being able to strongly affect development of life. Even if specialists still debate about the age of the oldest indubitable fossil trace of life, Archaean can be considered as having been extremely favourable for life development and diversification...|$|E
40|$|Highlights • <b>Hydrothermalism</b> in {{off-axis}} Tertiary Iceland {{crust is}} low-temperature ( 2 Ma) of the Reykjanes Ridge. Abstract Hydrothermal activity along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is predominantly high-temperature venting controlled by volcano-tectonic processes {{confined to the}} ridge axis and neotectonic zone, which extends 20 km {{on each side of}} the axis (e. g. TAG or Logatchev 1). These vents cannot, however, account for all the heat which needs to be removed to cool the plate and a significant amount of heat is probably removed in the off-axis regions as well. These regions have previously not been systematically surveyed for hydrothermal activity due to a lack of predictive models for its nature, location or controlling structures. Here we use hot springs in the Tertiary Westfjords of Iceland as onshore analogs for hydrothermal activity along the off-axis Mid-Atlantic Ridge to better understand tectonic and volcanological controls on their occurrence, as well as the processes which support hydrothermal circulation. Our results show that even crust ≥ 10 Ma has abundant low-temperature hydrothermal activity. We show that 66...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{combined}} {{study of}} boron concentrations and isotopic ratios and of major and trace elements measured in Réunion waters, sampled {{up to four}} times between 1995 and 2012, illustrates boron behavior during water-rock interactions in tropical basaltic catchments. Boron isotope ratios measured in Réunion rivers and springs show a large range of variation between 1 and 48 ‰, that reflect mixed B sources and water-rock interaction processes: rain (δ 11 B≈ 40 ‰), <b>hydrothermalism</b> (δ 11 B≈ 0 ‰), low temperature basalt weathering in steep sided basins (δ 11 B≈ 30 ‰), and cycling within soil and vegetation (δ 11 B> 40 ‰). Réunion rivers have schematically two types of δ 11 B signatures for low-temperature water-rock interactions: ≈ 30 ‰ for rivers with high weathering rates, and ≈ 45 ‰ for small forested catchments with relatively smoother slopes and lower weathering rates. High temperature water-rock interaction produces B enriched waters with a B isotopic signature close {{to that of the}} rocks. B behavior in the soil and vegetation cycle is more difficult to characterize but seems to result in soil solutions enriched in 11 B, with δ 11 B≥ 45 ‰...|$|E
40|$|The {{pressure}} {{exerted by}} shallow water hydrothermal vents on edible gastropods and their cellular responses triggered by these stresses are almost unknown. The aims {{of this study}} were to evaluate the bioavailability of metals in the Macaronesian endemic limpet Patella candei gomesii living close to shallow water hydrothermal vents, and the structural differences in their digestive gland as well as the levels of apoptosis in that organ. Limpets were sampled in four sites, two with the presence of <b>hydrothermalism</b> and the other two without it. Whole body concentrations of several metals (Ca, Cd, Cs, Co, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mg, Mn, Pb, Rb, Se, Sr, and Zn) were obtained, morphometry analysis of the digestive gland and TUNEL test for apoptosis were also performed. Results revealed that the presence of shallow water hydrothermal vents is a source of chronic metal stress to limpets, imposing modifications in the morphometry and cell composition of the digestive gland of those limpets that may constitute cell and tissue adaptations to the environment they live in. This study sets up new baseline data for further research on the influence of shallow water hydrothermal vents over communities living in these habitats...|$|E
