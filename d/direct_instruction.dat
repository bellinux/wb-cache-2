In North America are Anguilla, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Montserrat, and the Turks and Caicos Islands, while the Falkland Islands, and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands are located in South America. The Caribbean islands were colonised under the authority or the <b>direct</b> <b>instruction</b> {{of a number of}} European monarchs, mostly English, Dutch, or Spanish, throughout {{the first half of the}} 17th century. By 1681, however, when the Turks and Caicos Islands were settled by Britons, all of the above-mentioned islands were under the control of Charles II of England, Scotland, France and Ireland. Colonies were merged and split through various reorganizations of the Crown's Caribbean regions, until 19 December 1980, the date that Anguilla became a British Crown territory in its own right. The monarch is represented in these jurisdictions by: the Governor of Anguilla, Andrew George; the Governor of Bermuda, Richard Gozney; the Governor of the British Virgin Islands, David Pearey; the Governor of the Cayman Islands, Stuart Jack; the Governor of Montserrat, Elizabeth Carriere; and the Governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands, Peter Beckingham.|$|E

Ahmadi Muslims point out that as per Islamic prophecy, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad rendered Jihad in its military form as inapplicable in the present age as Islam, as a religion, is not being attacked militarily but through literature and other media, and therefore the response should be likewise.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contains a}} number of articles reporting on research on instruction for students who have difficulties learning mathematics. The focus lies {{on the kind of}} instruction that these students need to adequately master the mathematics skills required by the elementary school curriculum. Recent developments in mathematics education ask for guided instruction. In the study reported on here, the effectiveness of guided instruction for low-achieving students was investigated by conducting an intervention study in schools for regular and special elementary education. The effects of guided instruction were compared to the effects of <b>directed</b> <b>instruction,</b> which was found to be effective in former research. This study showed that guided instruction is almost equally effective as <b>directed</b> <b>instruction.</b> It is therefore concluded that both <b>directed</b> <b>instruction</b> and guided instruction can be effective for teaching multiplication to students with difficulties learning mathematics. In chapter 1, it is described how students normally receive mathematics education and how instruction could be adapted to their specific needs. Chapter 2 reports on a meta-analysis on studies that described the effects of different interventions for elementary school students with math learning difficulties. Interventions that focused on the learning of basic math skills proved to be the most effective. The results also show that <b>directed</b> <b>instruction</b> and self-instruction are more effective than guided instruction. A pilot study has been conducted to investigate the suitability of the intervention program and the testing materials. The results presented in Chapter 3, showed that both interventions were more effective than the regular math curriculum. Furthermore, it was found that guided instruction resulted in higher effects on the students multiplication ability than <b>directed</b> <b>instruction</b> and especially for the students in regular education. The main study is described in the Chapters 4 and 5. A total of 283 students from 24 schools for either special or general education have participated. The group of students was divided into three conditions: guided <b>instruction,</b> <b>directed</b> <b>instruction,</b> and regular instruction (control group). The results show that the students who had received <b>directed</b> <b>instruction</b> improved more than the students who had received guided instruction, although {{the differences between the two}} conditions proved to be small. It was also found that both experimental conditions were more effective than the control condition. Furthermore, it was found that the students strategy use improved significantly during the intervention period. The experimental students showed greater improvement than their control peers. The differences between both experimental conditions were nevertheless small. The study described in Chapter 6 was meant to investigate the relation between mathematics learning difficulties and cognition. The results showed that students with math learning difficulties perform on average lower on the PASS (Planning, Attention, Simultaneous, and Successive processes) scales than their peers without specific learning difficulties. The results also showed that students with specific math difficulties, such as difficulties with automaticity or with problem solving, have other cognitive profiles than both students without math difficulties and students with general math difficulties...|$|R
25|$|Foulois and Lieutenant Frank P. Lahm were {{initially}} designated to take <b>direct</b> <b>instruction</b> from the Wright brothers, but the CSO instead sent Foulois to Nancy, France in September 1909 as a {{delegate to the}} International Congress of Aeronautics, possibly {{as a result of}} resentment of his outspoken criticism of the dirigible. He returned on October 23 to College Park, Maryland, where Wilbur Wright had begun training Lahm and Lieutenant Frederick E. Humphreys. Humphreys made the first military solo in an airplane on October 26, 1909, followed by Lahm. Although not contractually obligated to do so, Wilbur took Foulois up and allowed him to handle the controls, then turned him over to Humphreys for instruction. Foulois totaled three hours and two minutes at the controls, virtually equaling the flight time of Humphreys and Lahm, but did not make any landings, nor did he solo. On November 5, Humphreys and Lahm cartwheeled S.C. No. 1 during landing, damaging the rudder and necessitating replacement of a wing, at a time when neither Wright brother was available. In addition, both officers were recalled to their branches of service.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} two weeks saw {{a period of}} prolonged combat, as the task force slowly fell back to {{the pressure of the}} German offensive, with the battalion split up among various commands and often cut off or out of communication. The infantry units the tank destroyers were assigned to expected to take full operational control, often giving inappropriate orders more suited to tanks than to the lightly armored M18s, breeding resentment among the battalion's crews. At the same time, the 827th had trained with the expectation that the gunners would fire only on the <b>direct</b> <b>instruction</b> of their own officers, which limited both their ability to co-operate with outsiders and their willingness to adapt and improvise during small-scale combat.

According to The Times, the broadcast [...] "provoked a storm of complaint... from listeners all over the country". Wodehouse's biographer, Joseph Connolly, thinks the broadcast [...] "inaccurate, spiteful and slanderous"; Phelps calls it [...] "probably the most vituperative attack on an individual ever heard on British radio". The broadcast was made at the <b>direct</b> <b>instruction</b> of Duff Cooper, the Minister of Information, who overruled strong protests made by the BBC against the decision to air the programme. Numerous letters appeared in the British press, both supporting and criticising Wodehouse. The letters page of The Daily Telegraph became a focus for censuring Wodehouse, including one from Wodehouse's friend, A.A. Milne; a reply from their fellow author Compton Mackenzie in defence of Wodehouse was not published because the editor claimed a lack of space. Most of those defending Wodehouse against accusations of disloyalty, including Sax Rohmer, Dorothy L. Sayers and Gilbert Frankau, conceded that he had acted stupidly. Some {{members of the public}} wrote to the newspapers to say that the full facts were not yet known and a fair judgment could not be made until they were. The management of the BBC, who considered Wodehouse's actions no worse than [...] "ill advised", pointed out to Cooper that there was no evidence at that point whether Wodehouse had acted voluntarily or under compulsion.|$|E

2500|$|Task {{analysis}} {{is a process}} in which a task is analyzed into its component parts so that those parts can be taught through the use of chaining: forward chaining, backward chaining and total task presentation. Task analysis has been used in organizational behavior management, a behavior analytic approach to changing the behaviors of members of an organization (e.g., factories, offices, or hospitals). Behavioral scripts often emerge from a task analysis. Bergan conducted a task analysis of the behavioral consultation relationship and Thomas Kratochwill developed a training program based on teaching Bergan's skills. A similar approach was used for the development of microskills training for counselors. Ivey would later call this [...] "behaviorist" [...] phase a very productive one and the skills-based approach came to dominate counselor training during 1970–90. Task analysis was also used in determining the skills needed to access a career.

2500|$|Modern {{nativism}} is most {{associated with}} the work of Jerry Fodor (1935–), Noam Chomsky (1928–), and Steven Pinker (1954–), who argue that humans from birth have certain cognitive modules (specialised genetically inherited psychological abilities) that allow them to learn and acquire certain skills, such as language. For example, children demonstrate a facility for acquiring spoken language but require intensive training to learn to read and write. This poverty of the stimulus observation became a principal component of Chomsky's argument for a [...] "language organ"—a genetically inherited neurological module that confers a somewhat universal understanding of syntax that all neurologically healthy humans are born with, which is fine-tuned by an individual's experience with their native language. [...] In The Blank Slate (2002), Pinker similarly cites the linguistic capabilities of children, relative to the amount of <b>direct</b> <b>instruction</b> they receive, as evidence that humans have an inborn facility for speech acquisition (but not for literacy acquisition).|$|E
