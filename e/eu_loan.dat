40|$|In this period, {{an often}} debated topic {{is related to}} credit risk, as more as it {{manifested}} lately and caused the trigger of the current crisis. Credit risk is not directly {{the subject of this}} work, but especially the ways of hedging credit risk. Therefore I examined in this paper the current trends in guaranteeing loans, respectively the institutional guarantees. Even if, in the other <b>EU</b> countries, <b>loans</b> guarantee funds work from many years in the case of Romania the activity of these funds is at the beginning. Therefore, the experience from other European countries, should lead to some measures that have to be taken in Romania in order to encourage the loans guarantee funds activity and to increase the confidence of the banks in the guarantees provided by this. This action may, on the one hand, facilitate the access of more companies to the credits provided by banks, {{and on the other hand}} a way to encourage lending, which can lead to an economic development and can contribute to the overcome of the actual economic crisis. loans guarantee funds, credit risk, SME’s, economic crisis...|$|R
