40|$|Using the non-equilibrium Green {{function}} method, {{we study}} the Andreev reflection in a Y-shaped graphene-superconductor device by tight-binding model. Considering both the zigzag and armchair terminals, we {{confirm that the}} zigzag terminals are the better choice for detecting the Andreev reflection without no external field. Due to scattering from {{the boundaries of the}} finite-size centre region, the difference between Andreev retroreflection and specular reflection is hard to be distinguished. Although adjusting the size of the device makes the difference visible, to distinguish them quantitatively is still impossible through the transport conductance. The problem is circumvented when applying a perpendicular magnetic field on the centre region, which makes the incident electrons and the reflected holes propagate along the edge or the interface. In this case, the retroreflected and specular reflected holes from the different bands have opposite effective masses, therefore the moving direction of one is opposite to the other. Which <b>external</b> <b>terminal</b> the reflected holes flow into depends entirely on the kind of the Andreev reflection. Therefore, the specular Andreev reflection can be clearly distinguished from the retroreflected one in the presence of strong magnetic field, even for the device with finite size.

H-bonds apparently involve C-C sigma-type orbitals of alkanes and C=C pi-type orbitals of alkenes and aromatics. Evidence is provided for a partial steric hindrance in the {{interaction of}} benzene and toluene with the internal OHs. Hydrogen bondings with alkanes are precursors for dehydrogenation {{with the formation of}} carbenium ions that go fast towards the tert-butyl-sec-butyl equilibrium, giving rise to skeletal isomerization and cracking. Poly-isobutene like species are formed at the surface by high-temperature interaction with both alkanes and alkenes. Isobutene is a likely precursor for such species, that are intermediates of coking and can contribute also to cracking to light olefins. H-bonded species are also thought to be intermediates for the formation of the so-called 'sigma-bonded' intermediate of electrophilic aromatic substitution, giving rise to toluene dealkylation and/or dismutation, obtained in the IR cell.

A procedure for detection of faults in a simple controllable Linear Sequential Circuit (LSC) over GF(2) is developed.

The characterizing matrix B, s vectors of the form AnBdv (v=l, 2, [...] .,s), s unit input vectors and the zero input vector are used instead of the fault table.
