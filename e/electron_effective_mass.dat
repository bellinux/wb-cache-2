5000|$|The <b>electron</b> <b>effective</b> <b>mass</b> of GaInAs m*/m° = 0.041 [...] is the {{smallest}} for any semiconductor material with an energy bandgap greater than 0.5 eV.

In practical terms, a low effective mass leads directly to high carrier mobility, favoring higher speed of transport and current carrying capacity. A lower carrier effective mass also favors increased tunneling current, {{a direct result of}} delocalization.|$|E

However, poor performance was observed due the extremely high effective electron mass of Ge.

30|$|Effective mass is more complicated, {{since it}} depends on carrier and direction. There are three points that should be noted on {{effective}} mass. First, the <b>electron</b> <b>effective</b> <b>mass</b> of 100 % HG and 100 %-HG/h-BN heterobilayer are isotropic, i.e., m*(ΓM)[*]=[*]m*(ΓK). The heterobilayer structure leads to a slight drop of <b>electron</b> <b>effective</b> <b>mass</b> compared with 100 % HG monolayer. The stacking pattern has slight influence on the <b>electron</b> <b>effective</b> <b>mass</b> (all of the four stacking patterns are about 0.90). Second, under the same hydrogenation pattern (i.e., 100 %, 25 % pattern I and 6.25 % pattern I), the electron m*(ΓK) decreases with the decreased hydrogen coverage. It is shown that the limit is 0.024 (the effective mass of graphene) as the hydrogen coverage reduces to zero. Third, under the same hydrogen coverage, effective mass is also affected by hydrogenation pattern. For 25 % HG, the <b>electron</b> <b>effective</b> <b>mass</b> of pattern I is {{much lower than the}} other two. In a word, the effective mass {{is more likely to be}} affected by hydrogenation but not the elastic modulus and deformation potential constant.|$|E
