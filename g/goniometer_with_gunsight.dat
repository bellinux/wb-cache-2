However, even without any rotation, some crosstalk can occur.

Six biaxial goniometers (M 110, Biometrics Ltd., Gwent, UK) were evaluated. A precision jig, for simulating pure flexion/extension angles, was constructed.

A procedure for correction for the inherent crosstalk of individual goniometer, based on polynomial adjust, is presented. The method for compensation, which reduced the root mean square error from, on average for the six goniometers, 3. 7 degrees (range 1. 8 - 10. 1 degrees) to 0. 35 degrees (0. 12 - 0. 55 degrees), might be required for obtaining valid goniometer measurements, e. g. of valgus/varus of the knee during gait flexion/extension movements.

40|$|Background: Shoulder flexion {{requires}} an optimal {{length of the}} latissimus dorsi muscle {{in order to allow}} full lateral rotation of the humerus and upward scapular rotation. If shoulder flexion (in an externally rotated position) is restricted, this may predispose the individual to shoulder pathology. Sports such as swimming and canoeing have increased shoulder injuries and require high levels of latissimus dorsi muscle activity, which may create muscle hypertrophy and increased stiffness, resulting in a loss of muscle length. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate if differences are present in shoulder flexion in internally and externally rotated positions across different sports (swimming, canoeing, and rugby) and a non-sporting control group. Methods: One hundred subjects (40 physically active controls, 25 professional Rugby Union players, 20 elite, national-level canoeists (slalom), and 15 elite, national-level swimmers) participated in this study.
