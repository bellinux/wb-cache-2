One of the most important tasks of the medical and nursing team is to reduce the anxiety of patients and subsequently to reduce the vital signs alterations. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of <b>Jasmine</b> essential <b>oil</b> inhalation on physiological parameters of patients before laparotomy. Method: This study was a randomized controlled clinical trial that was performed on 84 patients undergoing laparotomy in two groups of intervention and control. The intervention group inhaled two drops of <b>Jasmine</b> essential <b>oil</b> and the control group inhaled two drops of aquapura (sterile water) for one hour which was poured on their collar. Physiological variables including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rate of the patients were measured and recorded before and after intervention. Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 16. Results: The mean age of the intervention group was 35. 52 ± 12. 73 and it was 36. 26 ± 13. 39 in the control group. In the pre-intervention stage there were no significant differences in physiological parameters between two groups but after the <b>Jasmine</b> essential <b>oil</b> inhalation, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate and respiration rate variables were significantly different compared to pre-intervention stage (P< 0 / 0001) and this difference was also significant comparing the intervention and control groups (P< 0 / 0001). Conclusion: The physiologic parameters were markedly improved in intervention group after <b>Jasmine</b> essential <b>oil</b> inhalation compared to the control group, which prevented sudden and severe changes in patients waiting for surgery.

When the grandmother at one point forbids the oiling sessions, the girl suddenly becomes aware of hidden meanings and intuitions associated with this practice.

Diverging interpretations are presented {{of the role of the}} characters, the functionality of their characterization, and the use of description and suggestion to evoke the semantic framework of the story. The juxtaposition of two readings was prompted by a discussion with the author during a conference panel on rebellion in modern Indian literature and film.

Human nose cannot be seen as an objective sensor, so creating an artificial olfactory system, often called electronic nose or “e-nose”, which is capable to objectively and reliably classify odors in a wide range is a key research question in the field of artificial olfaction. In addition to the detection system in e-nose instruments, something analogical to human brain is needed to interpret the signals in the detecting sensors. Production of easily controllable and measurable odor stimulus is needed when studying human olfaction, olfaction-related physiology and psychological reactions to odors. Controlled odor producing instruments are called olfactometers. In this Master Thesis, a compact olfactometer able to produce controlled continuous odor stimuli from three individual gaseous components is presented. The main objective was to study and verify if the presented system can produce gas streams with the stable concentrations of different odor components. For measuring the output air stream, the device used is a chemical detector ChemPro 100 i, that is based on aspiration ion mobility spectrometry (aIMS) technology. The presented olfactometer was used to produce synthetic jasmine scent using three main odor components from <b>jasmine</b> <b>oil.</b> Experiments were conducted to verify the functionality of our olfactometer and to analyze the capability to distinguish different odor component concentrations using the ChemPro 100 i data. Further to test the functionality of our olfactometer, we run a short pilot test in which human participants compared a synthetically created scent of jasmine and the scent of real <b>jasmine</b> <b>oil.</b> Results showed that from the measurement data, different concentration sets of three components were able to be distinguished. Human pilot results showed that human nose was confused when comparing three component synthetic jasmine with real jasmine scent but could distinguish between two component synthetic jasmine and real jasmine scent...|$|E
40|$|In {{moderately}} colored guinea-pig skin, UVB, PUVA (psoralen plus UVA), and allergic {{contact dermatitis}} were shown to induce visibly well-defined hyperpigmentation that resembled the pigmentary changes observed in Mongoloid human skin. To clarify mechanisms of allergen-induced hyperpigmentation, we compared the effects of {{allergic contact dermatitis}} on pigmentation by using 6 different allergens: dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), 1 -phenylazo- 2 -naphthol (PAN), benzyl salicylate (BS), <b>jasmine</b> <b>oil</b> (JO), hydroxycitronella (HC), and ylang ylang oil (YYO). The PAN-, JO-, HG-, and YYO-induced allergic reactions caused a definite visible hyperpigmentation that began to appear within 14 days, reaching maximum intensity about 40 days after the induction of the allergic reaction. These hyperpigmentations were accompanied by {{a significant increase in}} the population of dopa-positive melanocytes on day 24 following allergic reactions. In contrast, BS- and DNCB-induced allergic reactions did not give rise to visibly distinct hyperpigmentation in spite of the intensive allergic reactions following their challenge application. In a nonsensitized group, primary irritant reactions were induced by the application of 100 % JO, but no distinctive hyperpigmentation was found 40 days after the last application. Quantitative analysis of the number of melanophages in the dermis showed that there was a marked increase in the number of melanophages in PAN, YYO, and HC allergy-induced hyperpigmented areas, with PAN showing a significant increase compared with those in non- treated areas of the same animals, whereas JO was associated with no such increase in hyperpigmented area, despite the stimulated pigmentation. In the case of the lack of induced hyperpigmentation, as seen in BS and DNCB allergy and JO irritation, there was also no substantial increase in the number of melanophages. Our findings indicate that allergic contact dermatitis is a unique melanogenic stimulant different from UV irradiation...|$|E
