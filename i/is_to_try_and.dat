25|$|As {{sugar levels}} in the grape rise, acid levels fall. All wines need some degree of acidity {{in order to be}} {{balanced}} and avoid tasting flabby or dull. Acidity is also a key component in food and wine pairing so its presence in wine is important with winemakers trying to harvest grapes before acid levels fall too low. The stress to maintain acid levels is not as bearing {{due to the fact that}} winemakers can rectify the situation somewhat by later adding acids during the winemaking process (winemakers can also rectify deficiencies in sugar levels by chaptalization). However natural acids in the grape play other roles in the development of flavor and aroma compounds as well as fighting against the effects of spoilage organisms so the most ideal situation for winemakers <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> harvest while acid levels are acceptable.|$|E
500|$|Others {{have noted}} {{that the lack of}} {{coverage}} is not simply a media issue. Peter Fahy, the spokesman on race issues for the Association of Chief Police Officers said: [...] "A lot of police officers and other professionals feel almost {{the best thing to do}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> avoid [...] for fear of being criticised. This is not healthy". Montague suggests the lack of police appeals in cases involving white victims may be a cause of the lack of media coverage. Evidence of this was seen in the Parker case, with the police initially appearing keen to dismiss the possible racist aspect of the murder, stating [...] "there was no reason to believe that the attack was racially motivated".|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Wallabies coach Robbie Deans and {{selectors}} wagered {{the potential}} returns in finishing games with two openside flankers {{on the field}} {{as a way to}} counter McCaw. In September 2012 after the All Blacks v South African Test in Dunedin, then South African coach Heyneke Meyer said that McCaw was the greatest rugby player the world has ever seen. Following the All Blacks win over Wallabies to claim their 3rd World Cup, All Blacks Coach Steve Hansen praised McCaw's and Dan Carter's career efforts, distinguishing McCaw from Carter:“Richie is the best All Black we have ever had and Dan is a close second,” said Hansen. “The only thing that separates them is Richie has played 148 matches at flanker, which is unheard of - you put your body on the line every time you go there. The challenge for the other guys now <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> become as great as him and Dan.” ...|$|E

500|$|Her {{attitude}} and language often sharply polarized debate, and made Dworkin herself {{a figure of}} intense controversy. After her death, the conservative gay writer Andrew Sullivan claimed that [...] "Many on the social right liked Andrea Dworkin. Like Dworkin, their essential impulse when they see human beings living freely <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> control or stop them [...] for their own good. Like Dworkin, they are horrified by male sexuality, and see men as such as a problem to be tamed. Like Dworkin, they believe {{in the power of}} the state to censor and coerce sexual freedoms. Like Dworkin, they view the enormous new freedom that women and gay people have acquired since the 1960s as a terrible development for human culture." [...] Libertarian/conservative journalist Cathy Young complained of a [...] "whitewash" [...] in feminist obituaries for Dworkin, argued that Dworkin's positions were manifestly misandrist, stated that Dworkin was in fact insane, criticized what she called Dworkin's [...] "destructive legacy", and described Dworkin as a [...] "sad ghost" [...] that feminism needs to exorcise.|$|E
500|$|Several co-stars found Steiger difficult; Warren Oates, {{according}} to director Norman Jewison, viewed Steiger as [...] "somebody {{who had a}} tendency to go over the top" [...] during the making of In The Heat of the Night. Writer Richard Dyer highlights the contrast in the film between the acting styles of Steiger and Poitier, with [...] "Poitier's stillness and implied intensity" [...] and [...] "Steiger's busy, exteriorised method acting". Humphrey Bogart, Steiger's co-star of The Harder They Fall, referred to Steiger's method acting as the [...] "scratch-your-ass-and-mumble school of acting". Director Robert Aldrich notes that Steiger had a habit of changing his lines, which often confused his co-stars. Aldrich stated: [...] "Usually I lie awake at nights trying to think of ways to improve an actor's performance. With Steiger, the problem <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> contain him". Steiger was particularly aggressive towards director Kenneth Annakin during the making of Across the Bridge, insisting on rewriting most of the script and changing many of the lines to better fit Steiger's idea of the character. Annakin stated that he had [...] "never known an actor to put so much thought and preparation into a performance" [...] as Steiger. Hutchinson revealed that Steiger often suffered from panic during filming and that fear of failure haunted him throughout his life, but fear also provided him with a source of strength in his acting.|$|E
500|$|Songs {{featured}} within [...] "Valley Girls" [...] {{were taken}} from both the Los Angeles punk rock scene and mainstream 1980s hits in order to represent the two worlds surrounding character Lily Rhodes. [...] "Jumping between these two worlds {{is important to the}} show. Lily is living with her sister in the Valley and kind of hanging out in the punk rock scene, but she and her sister come from a wealthy family and their parents are more aligned with a Pacific Palisades/Beverly Hills/Malibu, Less Than Zero world. So her struggle... <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> figure out what kind of world she wants to be in", says Savage. Music supervisor Alexandra Patsavas oversaw music selection for the episode. With the exception of Fountains of Wayne's [...] "Prom Theme" [...] (1999), every song featured within [...] "Valley Girls" [...] was released prior to or in 1983, the year in which Lily's flashbacks take place. Savage explains that the show makers hoped to introduce modern audiences to bands and music they had not known before. No Doubt makes an uncredited guest appearance during the episode as a fictional band called [...] "Snowed Out", a play on words of [...] "No Doubt". During the cameo, part of the band's return to music after a four-year hiatus, No Doubt premiered their cover of Adam and the Ants' [...] "Stand and Deliver", the band's first new song in five years. The band performs in the Sunset Strip club where Lily meets Carol {{for the first time in}} a year.|$|E

Later, NME confirmed the band would be playing a special intimate show in London to celebrate Skene's arrival. Similar to Andy Monaghan's entry into the band in early 2008, Skene was not involved in recording the album. Upon his arrival, Hutchison noted that [...] "it must be difficult for him coming into something that four other people were involved in studio-wise. He's not seen any of that process yet.
