40|$|The {{integration}} of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>technologies</b> in {{the automotive industry}} as an option to cope with environmental issues has typically attracted significant attention among politicians, academics, and the media. After the recent “hydrogen hype” this interest in <b>hydrogen</b> <b>technologies</b> highlights the need to fully understand to what extent this sector is being pushed by new inventions. This paper presents a worldwide patent analysis of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>technologies</b> in the automotive sector. The study has been performed using a novel methodology by assessing trends of patents between 1990 and 2010 and their citations. As a result, we emphasise that the interest in <b>hydrogen</b> <b>technologies</b> has not declined over time and is mainly focusing on {{a small number of}} niches, although competing alternatives, such as electric vehicles, capture greater interest. Moreover, citation trends provide further insight into the development prospects of fuel cell and storage technologies as a point of convergence of multi-sectorial investments and, consequently, of potential R&D strategies in the automotive sector...|$|R
40|$|To provide {{and improve}} {{national}} energy security and low-carbon green energy economy, as a government-supported research institute related to developing new {{and renewable energy}} technologies, including energy efficiency, Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER) needs to establish a long-term strategic energy technology roadmap (ETRM) in the hydrogen economy sector for sustainable economic development. In this paper, we establish a strategic ETRM for <b>hydrogen</b> energy <b>technologies</b> in the <b>hydrogen</b> economy considering five criteria: economic impact (EI), commercial potential (CP), inner capacity (IC), technical spin-off (TS), and development cost (DC). As an extended research, we apply the integrated two-stage multi-criteria decision-making approach, including the hybrid fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) model, to assess the relative efficiency of <b>hydrogen</b> energy <b>technologies</b> in order to scientifically implement the hydrogen economy. Fuzzy AHP reflects the vagueness of human thought with interval values, and allocates the relative importance and weights of four criteria: EI, CP, IC, and TS. The DEA approach measures the relative efficiency of <b>hydrogen</b> energy <b>technologies</b> for the <b>hydrogen</b> economy with a ratio of outputs over inputs. The result of measuring the relative efficiency of <b>hydrogen</b> energy <b>technologies</b> focuses on 4 <b>hydrogen</b> <b>technologies</b> out of 13 <b>hydrogen</b> energy <b>technologies.</b> KIER has to focus on developing 4 strategic <b>hydrogen</b> energy <b>technologies</b> from economic view point {{in the first phase}} with limited resources. In addition, if energy policy makers consider as some candidates for strategic <b>hydrogen</b> <b>technologies</b> of the other 9 <b>hydrogen</b> energy <b>technology,</b> the performance and productivity of 9 <b>hydrogen</b> energy <b>technologies</b> should be increased and the input values of them have to be decreased. With a scientific decision-making approach, we can assess the relative efficiency of <b>hydrogen</b> energy <b>technologies</b> efficiently and allocate limited research and development (R&D) resources effectively for well-focused R&D. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

50|$|Alset Global emphasises the {{importance}} of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>technology</b> for a sustainable mobility.

40|$|Two {{different}} {{options for}} the autonomous power supply of rural or/and remote buildings are examined in this study. The first one involves a PV - diesel based power system, while the second one integrates RES and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>technologies</b> {{for the development of}} a self - sustained power system. The main objective is the replacement of the diesel generator and a comparison between these two options for autonomous power supply. Model simulations of the two power systems before and after the replacement, an optimization of the component sizes and a techno - economic analysis have been performed for the purpose of this study. A sensitivity analysis taking into account future cost scenarios for <b>hydrogen</b> <b>technologies</b> is also presented. The results clearly show that the Cost of Energy Produced (COE) from the PV - <b>hydrogen</b> <b>technologies</b> power system is extremely higher than the PV - diesel power system. However, the adopted PV - <b>hydrogen</b> <b>technologies</b> power system reduces to zero the Green - House Gas (GHG) emissions. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis indicates that COE for the latter system can be further reduced by approximately 50 % compared to its initial value. This could be achieved by reducing critical COE's parameters, such as PEM electrolyser and fuel cell capital costs. Hence, a possible reduction on the capital costs of hydrogen energy equipment in combination with emissions reduction mentioned above could make hydrogen - based power systems more competitive.
