500|$|The rise of militancy became {{apparent}} to Frank Kameny and Barbara Gittings—who {{had worked in}} homophile organizations for years and were both very public about their roles—when they attended a GLF meeting {{to see the new}} group. A young GLF member demanded to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> and what their credentials were. Gittings, nonplussed, stammered, [...] "I'm gay. That's why I'm here." [...] The GLF borrowed tactics from and aligned themselves with black and antiwar demonstrators with the ideal that they [...] "could work to restructure American society". They took on causes of the Black Panthers, marching to the Women's House of Detention in support of Afeni Shakur, and other radical New Left causes. Four months after they formed, however, the group disbanded when members were unable to agree on operating procedure.|$|E
2500|$|A {{major reason}} why neither Adam nor Brad has been {{identified}} is because Eyler did not <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>were,</b> {{unlike the rest of}} his victims. In addition, he was known to dispose of any identification that he would find on his victims. Hoping to make a plea bargain, Eyler had made a list of his victims while awaiting execution in the 1990s for a 1984 murder in Chicago. He died of AIDS before his execution date.|$|E
2500|$|The panellists play as {{individuals}} or as two teams. [...] "Celebrity What's My Line?" [...] completely destroyed {{the intent of}} the original— for players to guess the occupation of a third party by asking yes/no questions. The I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue version once employed the famous actress (and fan of the show) Dame Judi Dench in this role and the renowned television gardener Alan Titchmarsh. Each began by performing a mime illustrating their occupation, giving a cryptic clue to the panel (appearing to a radio listener as a short silence punctuated by exclamations from the panel and laughter from the studio audience), before fielding apparently serious questions from the teams (e.g. [...] "Is that your own hair?" [...] or [...] "Do you kill people for money?"), who pretended not to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>were.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Eventually, the NCAA {{investigation}} {{revealed that}} in 1985 and 1986, 13 players {{had been paid}} a total of $61,000 from a slush fund provided by a booster. Payments ranged from $50 to $725 per month and had started only a month after SMU had been handed its latest probation. The Times Herald later identified the booster as Dallas real-estate developer Sherwood Blount, Jr., who played for the Mustangs from 1969 to 1971 (though according to Parker, other boosters were almost certainly involved). The players had received a total of $47,000 during the 1985-86 school year. Eight of those players were paid an additional $14,000 from September to December 1986. The slush fund was due to be discontinued when the 13 players had all left the school. These payments were made with the full knowledge and approval of athletic department staff. [...] According to the Morning News, Hitch knew {{about the existence of}} a slush fund as early as 1981 and was involved in the decision to continue the payments even after SMU was placed on probation in 1985. The Morning News also said Collins knew certain players were being paid, but did not <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>were.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{challenge to}} Jackson and Baird's theory, which more closely resembles actual legal policy, came initially from Elizabeth Warren. Warren argued that Jackson and Baird's model is dangerously oversimplified, {{and based on}} untested hypothetical assertions about behaviour. First, every system of insolvency law must necessarily make choices about how losses are distributed among creditors with multiple interest. Among these diverse interests include weaker creditors, particularly employees, who are less capable than others at diversifying the risks of insolvency. There is a distinct community interest in companies that survive, and no good reason why only creditors with provable proprietary interests in a company's winding up {{should be taken into}} account. This means it is reasonable to give preference to more vulnerable creditors, and to expect secured creditors take on some additional risk to ensure businesses survive for the greater good. The Baird and Jackson view essentially amounts to [...] "single-value economic rationality, an excuse to impose a distributional scheme without justifying it, and, incidentally, a way to work in a damn good deal for secured creditors." [...] Additionally, Lucian Bebchuk has argued that the institution of security interests operates as a partially unjustified negative externality against unsecured creditors. It is not clear, argues Bebchuk, that security interests are in fact efficient, and they are capable of subsidising their activities by diverting wealth from unsecured creditors to themselves without any agreement. In the UK, Roy Goode argues that banks usually take security interests, not because they would otherwise charge a higher interest rate (and so increasing credit to businesses for the benefit of all creditors) but because they calculate the market will bear it. The taking of security depends, not on efficiency, but on bargaining power. Riz Mokal, also deeply critical of the creditors' bargain model, suggests that if one were to follow Baird and Jackson's methodology but in a truly value neutral way, one would ask what creditors would hypothetically agree to if they did not <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> at all (i.e. whether they were voluntary or involuntary creditors, secured or unsecured). This would likely lead to a result where secured credit was not inviolable, and insolvency law could take account of diverse interests, including corporate rescue.|$|E
