25|$|France {{is one of}} the few {{countries}} in the world with an active nuclear reprocessing program, with the COGEMA La Hague site. Enrichment work, some MOX <b>fuel</b> <b>fabrication,</b> and other activities take place at the Tricastin Nuclear Power Centre. Enrichment is completely domestic and is powered by 2/3 of the output of the nuclear plant at Tricastin. Reprocessing of fuel from other countries has been done for the United States and Japan, who have expressed the desire to develop a more closed fuel cycle similar to what France has achieved. MOX <b>fuel</b> <b>fabrication</b> services have also been sold to other countries, notably to the USA for the Megatons to Megawatts Program, using plutonium from dismantled nuclear weapons.|$|E

25|$|Nuclear vendors provide fuel in its {{fabricated}} form, {{ready to}} be loaded in the reactor, nuclear services, and/or manage construction of new nuclear plants. The following is an incomplete list of companies based in Japan that provide such services. The companies listed here provide fuel or services for commercial light water plants, {{and in addition to}} this, JAEA has a small MOX <b>fuel</b> <b>fabrication</b> plant. Japan operates a robust nuclear fuel cycle.|$|E
25|$|Business model - Today's solid-fueled reactor vendors make {{long term}} {{revenues}} by <b>fuel</b> <b>fabrication.</b> Without any fuel to fabricate and sell, an LFTR would adopt a different business model. There would be significant {{barrier to entry}} costs {{to make this a}} viable business. Existing infrastructure and parts suppliers are geared towards water-cooled reactors. There is little thorium market and thorium mining, so considerable infrastructure that would be required does not yet exist. Regulatory agencies have less experience regulating thorium reactors, creating potentials for extended delays.|$|E

25|$|Since 2000 {{the nuclear}} {{industry}} has undertaken an international media and lobbying campaign to promote nuclear power {{as a solution to}} the greenhouse effect and climate change. Nuclear power, the industry says, emits no or negligible amounts of carbon dioxide. Anti-nuclear groups respond by saying that only reactor operation is free of carbon dioxide emissions. All other stages of the nuclear fuel chain – mining, milling, transport, <b>fuel</b> <b>fabrication,</b> enrichment, reactor construction, decommissioning and waste management – use fossil fuels and hence emit carbon dioxide.|$|E

25|$|The {{vulnerability}} of nuclear plants to deliberate attack {{is of concern}} {{in the area of}} nuclear safety and security. Nuclear power plants, civilian research reactors, certain naval fuel facilities, uranium enrichment plants, <b>fuel</b> <b>fabrication</b> plants, and even potentially uranium mines are vulnerable to attacks which could lead to widespread radioactive contamination. The attack threat is of several general types: commando-like ground-based attacks on equipment which if disabled could lead to a reactor core meltdown or widespread dispersal of radioactivity; and external attacks such as an aircraft crash into a reactor complex, or cyber attacks.|$|E
