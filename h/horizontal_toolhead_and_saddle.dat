40|$|In todayâ€™s world, Printed Circuit Boards, {{also known}} as PCBs, are part of our daily lives. However, it is {{currently}} difficult for students in university classes or hobbyists to quickly produce custom made PCBs since no system exists where every step in the production process is on one platform. There are four main steps that go into manufacturing a PCB once it is fully designed which are: milling, solder dispensing, component placement, and a reflow process. The goal will be to create various <b>toolheads</b> <b>and</b> place them onto a single platform allowing the user to perform the aforementioned production processes. After the design and manufacturing of these toolheads, functionality of the system was tested. Although single components of the system work, the entire system is not currently able to function in synchrony. This means {{there is still a}} lot of user input for the system such as having to use outdated operating systems, place the components in the component tray and move the board three times throughout the process...|$|R
