40|$|Hydrological {{processes}} in the karst basin are controlled by the permeable multi-media consisting of soil pores, epikarst fractures and underground conduits. Distributed modeling of hydrological dynamics in such heterogeneously hydrogeological conditions is a challenging task. Based on the multi-layer structure of the distributed hydrology-soil-vegetation model (DHSVM), a distributed hydrological model for a karst basin was developed by integrating mathematical routings of porous Darcy flow, fissure flow and underground channel flow. Specifically, infiltration and saturated flow movement within epikarst fractures are expressed by the "cubic law" equation which is associated with fractural width, direction and spacing. A typical karst basin located in Guizhou province of southwest China was selected for this hydrological simulation. The basin has detailed meteorological, soil moisture content and underground <b>flow</b> <b>discharges.</b> In addition, in situ measurements of soil properties and hydraulic conductivities were also available. Distribution of epikarst fractures was statistically generated based on fractural features data collected during field investigations. Hydraulic conductivities of epikarst fractures are estimated based on observed <b>flow</b> <b>discharges</b> as initial values. These parameters together with others are further calibrated through marching the observed and simulated soil moisture contents and underground <b>flow</b> <b>discharges</b> from the basin outlet.

In {{order to}} {{estimate}} low flow return periods for an ungaged watershed in Colombia, a regional analysis of low <b>flow</b> <b>discharges</b> was performed using the Wakeby probability distribution function.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology for the computation of optimal feedback flow rates (flow velocities and <b>flow</b> <b>discharges)</b> for pedestrian evacuation from {{a network of}} corridors using network-wide pedestrian congestion data. The pedestrian flow is defined in a macroscopic sense, wherein ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for each corridor and node are obtained using the conservation of pedestrian mass. The effect of congestion on the <b>flow</b> velocities and <b>discharges</b> in the corridor and the corridor intersections is explicitly modeled. Collectively, these corridor and node equations define the state-space model of the pedestrian flow in the network. The state variables signify the congestion in a corridor or an intersection, whereas the control variables directly affect the flow velocities and the <b>flow</b> <b>discharges.</b> For this model, an optimization-based control algorithm is developed to ensure a maximum total instantaneous input discharge that is subject to tracking the optimal congestion state and boundedness of the control variables. A comparison of the simulation results in the controlled and uncontrolled scenarios shows superior performance in the controlled case due to convergence to the optimal congestion state and consistently high network input and exit discharges...|$|R
40|$|Many {{industrial}} processes involve particulates with materials ranging from pharmaceuticals, ceramics, cosmetics and foods. Common {{to all these}} particulate processes is the discharge of granular material from bins/hoppers in either mass flow mode (i. e. all material regions in the domain are in motion) or core flow mode (i. e. there is a flowing material channel above the orifice of the discharging vessel and there are stagnant material regions further away from it). A mathematical model which accounts for material size segregation of multi-component granular mixtures during mass <b>flow</b> <b>discharges</b> has been developed and validated [1]; however, most of the observed discharges in {{industrial processes}} occur in core flow mode. The development of a reliable framework for the modelling of core <b>flow</b> <b>discharges</b> is more complicated, due {{to the existence of}} stagnant zones. Recently, a continuum mechanics approach for the modeling of such processes was proposed, which makes use of kinematic principles of granular dynamics [2]. The incorporation of material segregation in the model is crucial in order to predict the correct evolution of any industrial operation. In this paper, the application of the continuum model is presented in a real industrial problem. The segregation propensity of a multi-component granular mixture is assessed with the aid of experimental data and then predictions are made for the segregation patterns developed during mixture <b>discharge</b> in core <b>flow</b> mode.

40|$|<b>Flow</b> <b>discharge</b> {{from the}} river basin into the sea has severe impacts on the {{immediate}} vicinity of river channels, estuaries, and coastal areas. This paper analyzes the features and temporal trends of <b>flow</b> <b>discharge</b> at Pearl River's three main gauge stations: the Wuzhou, Shijiao, and Boluo gauge stations on the West River, North River, and East River, respectively. The results show no significant trend in annual mean discharge into the sea at the three gauge stations. Changes of monthly mean discharge at the Boluo Gauge Station are evident, {{and a majority of}} monthly discharge in the dry season displays significant increasing trends. Furthermore, changes of the extreme discharge are quite evident, with a significant decreasing trend in the annual maximum discharge and a significant increasing trend in the minimum one. The significantly decreasing ratio of the flood discharge to annual discharge at the Boluo Gauge Station indicates that the <b>flow</b> <b>discharge</b> from the East River has increased in the dry season and decreased in the flood season since the construction of dams and reservoirs. At the other two gauge stations, the Wuzhou and Shijiao gauge stations, the seasonal discharge generally does not change perceptibly. Human impacts, especially those pertaining to reservoir and dam construction, appear to be responsible for the seasonal variation of <b>flow</b> <b>discharge.</b> The results indicate that the construction and operation of dams and reservoirs in the East River have a greater influence on <b>flow</b> <b>discharge,</b> which can well explain why the seasonal variation of <b>flow</b> <b>discharge</b> from the East River is more evident...|$|E
