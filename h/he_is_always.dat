5|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> there, {{he knows}} everything. He is infallible but always failing. When the boys rescue him, he is {{typically}} emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with candy bars and water. He {{can take on}} any shape, but reveals his identity within moments of doing so. He never discusses a case except the one he's working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a Hardy Boys novel begins, which is of course {{the only time we}} ever get to see him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons and put them in mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI to shame, yet <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> losing his case notes, his ciphers, his microfilm, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that the Boys have to drive to Canada or Florida or somewhere to retrieve it. I suppose he isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many think of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.|$|E
5|$|Captain Archibald Haddock (Capitaine Haddock in Hergé's {{original}} version) is a Merchant Marine sea {{captain and}} Tintin's best friend. Introduced in The Crab with the Golden Claws, Haddock is initially {{depicted as a}} weak and alcoholic character, but later evolves to become genuinely heroic and even a socialite after he finds a treasure from his ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock (Chevalier François de Hadoque in the original version). The Captain's coarse humanity and sarcasm act as a counterpoint to Tintin's often-implausible heroism; <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> quick with a dry comment whenever the boy reporter seems too idealistic. After he and Tintin find Red Rackham's treasure, Captain Haddock lives in the luxurious mansion Marlinspike Hall (Le château de Moulinsart in the original French).|$|E
5|$|The early stories present Valérian as {{a typical}} square-jawed hero figure, who is strong and {{dependable}} (although an early running joke was that despite being a time-traveller <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> running late, especially when summoned by his boss). However, as the series progresses, he is increasingly portrayed as somewhat knuckle-headed. In World Without Stars (Le Pays sans étoile), he gets recklessly drunk on the colonists' home-made booze, in On the False Earths (Sur les terres truquées), the historian, Jadna, views him as useful only as cannon fodder and nothing else while in Heroes of the Equinox (Les Héros de l'Equinoxe), he comes across as woefully inadequate compared with the champions he is competing against. Although devoted to Laureline, he has been led astray by other women, such as in Heroes of the Equinox and Brooklyn Station, Terminus Cosmos.|$|E
50|$|Throughout Wilson’s career, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> “dogged by misadventure” and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> seeking {{funds to}} support his ambitious work.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> nicknamed Bizz (or Biz) by his siblings. His sister Diana {{has claimed}} that it <b>was</b> because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> so busy with working on something, but his brother Bret {{said in his}} {{autobiography}} that it <b>was</b> because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> up to some mischievous business.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> in love, of course; {{every human}} nat'ral {{phenomenon}} <b>is.</b> And <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> {{in love with}} a large woman; I never knowed the Dwarf as could be got to love a small one. Which helps to keep 'em the Curiosities they are.|$|R
25|$|Although he {{constantly}} teases Hikari, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> {{there for her}} when she needs him.|$|E
25|$|Sir Thomas Ashby—Rosalie's husband. He has {{a terrible}} {{character}} which Rosalie knows about when she marries him. While <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> talking about different women, he gets furious and jealous if Rosalie mentions one other man.|$|E
25|$|Andy: Andy is {{very sweet}} and kind. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> being {{made fun of}} by Quinn and Vange for having more muscle than brains. He lives on a farm with his family. He often works there before and after school. Andy is closest to Megan.|$|E
50|$|Whilst {{representing}} West Cornwall, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> elected unopposed.|$|R
5000|$|Lic. Rafael Reyes - Lawyer, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> {{worried about}} education.|$|R
60|$|Henri <b>was</b> {{slightly}} annoyed. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> annoyed when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{not taken}} seriously.|$|R
25|$|Tootles– Tootles is the humblest Lost Boy {{because he}} often misses {{out on their}} violent adventures. Although he is often stupid, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> the first to defend Wendy. Ironically, he shoots her before meeting {{her for the first}} time because of Tinker Bell's trickery. He grows up to become a judge.|$|E
25|$|The main male {{protagonist of}} the story, Leo {{is a second}} year student from class 2-C in high school. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> hanging around with his {{childhood}} friends Shinichi Samesuga, Subaru Date, and Kinu Kanisawa often while inside the student council building. He is an average male high school student {{who is on the}} student council.|$|E
25|$|Jives is a {{lethargic}} {{and weak}} teenage boy {{who lives in}} a tall house that appears to be bending over. He wears a green cap and a yellow sweatshirt. Jives is only physically seen in the Icelandic plays, but his home remains in the TV series. He also makes several cameos on cards and books. Jives never comes outside because <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> sleeping.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, so did I at the time,' {{returned}} Quilp, 'but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> obstinate. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> in {{a manner}} a friend of mine, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> obstinate and wrong-headed. Little Nell is a nice girl, a charming girl, but you're her brother, Frederick. You're her brother after all; as you told him {{the last time you}} met, he can't alter that.' ...|$|R
60|$|Colonel Lawley. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> {{inclined}} to <b>be</b> {{a bit of}} a faddist.|$|R
60|$|Westover met {{the ladies}} {{coming out of}} the dining-room as he went in rather late to breakfast; <b>he</b> had <b>been</b> making a study of Lion's Head in the morning light after the cloud lifted from it. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> doing Lion's Heads, it seemed to him; but he loved the mountain, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> finding {{something}} new in it.|$|R
25|$|A hotblooded, womanizing Libra {{member and}} {{master of the}} Big Dipper blood {{fighting}} style's Kagutsuchi branch, which allows him to manipulate his blood into blades and explosions. His juvenile actions often get him {{and the rest of}} Libra into trouble. He is Leonardo's partner and despite his usual attitude, he cares about him in some way. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> trying to defeat Klaus on a battle, but is always the one to lose.|$|E
25|$|In {{the folk}} tales, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> {{portrayed as a}} pious Hindu, being younger than Akbar, and being morally strict {{in the midst of}} {{opposing}} Muslim courtiers, who are shown plotting against him; his success was only because of his skill and he convinces the Emperor to favour Hinduism over Islam. He is thus depicted as acquiring religious, political and personal influence over Akbar, using his intelligence and sharp tongue and never resorting to violence. However, historically he never played such a role.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, the {{instrumental}} members of Alter Bridge {{turned their attention}} to their other band, Creed, embarking on a tour. Tremonti emphasized that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> writing music for both Creed and Alter Bridge. Myles Kennedy turned his attention to his project with Slash, releasing Apocalyptic Love (2012), while Mark Tremonti released a solo album All I Was (2012). Phillips joined a new band called Projected with Sevendust members John Connolly and Vinnie Hornsby, and former Submersed guitarist Eric Friedman, releasing an album called Human.|$|E
5000|$|Chinnery {{admitted}} that while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> controller <b>he</b> confronted Jimmy Savile over allegations of inappropriate sexual activities, which Savile denied; Chinnery said [...] "there {{was no reason}} to disbelieve" [...] him. Chinnery took no further action, saying: [...] "He was the sort of man that attracted rumours, after all, because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> single, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> on the move, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> going around the country." ...|$|R
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> in a {{rush and}} disliked going back for changes or corrections.|$|R
60|$|He explained, dear {{bundle of}} clothes and dirt! that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> {{perfectly}} respectable when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> drunk.|$|R
25|$|The {{narrative}} {{evokes the}} first humans created by Roog {{with a female}} being the first, and the trials they had faced. It also evokes the name of Roog, regarded as the Omnipotence, whom through his paternal nature, acted as a good father and moved the woman to a more comfortable place when she complained about her discomfort. It shows that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> available to his children. The appearance of the man initially surprised the woman, whom she named Ngoor (virile), yet, they later became companions and procreated.|$|E
25|$|Winston (Jeff Lumby) is {{the owner}} and sole {{employee}} of Rothschild's Sewage and Septic Sucking Services. Like Dalton and Mike, Winston is one of Red Green's friends and takes part in the day-to-day operations at Possum Lodge. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> seen wearing a hard hat, a white button-down shirt, a bowtie and hip waders. He is generally upbeat and has a positive outlook on life, and is usually able to {{look on the bright}} side of things even in the face of certain disaster. He is also a fan of self help speakers Anthony Anthony (whom he likes to quote) and Walter Mollusk.|$|E
25|$|Boromir's {{attempts}} {{to gain the}} Ring for himself {{have been described as}} well-intentioned but oblivious of the potential danger. His perception of Middle-earth is biased by a point of view that imagines that divine powers have chosen Gondor to lead the fight against evil. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> eager to praise the great deeds of Gondor, including his own. When his hubris eventually leads him into attacking Frodo to seize the Ring, Boromir seals his own doom by giving in to the malign power of the Ring. He makes way thereby for Aragorn to become the future king of Gondor, {{in a manner similar to}} Virgil's character Turnus.|$|E
5000|$|Although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> in {{opposition}} during his state political career, Jones held several roles: ...|$|R
60|$|A. I don't know. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> a {{particular}} kind of a man that way.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> {{just that}} strict and delicate. He never would {{tell a lie}} himself.|$|R
25|$|In 1406 renewed {{efforts were}} made to stop the schism, and Chichele was one of the envoys sent to the new Pope Gregory XII. Here he {{utilised}} his opportunities. On 31 August 1407 Guy Mone (<b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> so spelt and not Mohun, and was probably from one of the Hampshire Meons; there was a John Mone of Havant admitted a Winchester scholar in 1397), bishop of St David's, died, and on 12 October 1407 Chichele was by the pope provided to the bishopric of St David's. Another bull the same day gave him the right to hold all his benefices with the bishopric. He was consecrated on 17 June 1408.|$|E
25|$|Finding himself {{seated on}} a couch with Socrates and Agathon, Alcibiades exclaims that Socrates, again, has managed {{to sit next to}} the handsomest man in the room, Agathon, and that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> doing such things (213c). Socrates asks Agathon to protect him from the jealous rage of Alcibiades, asking Alcibiades to forgive him (213d). Alcibiades says he will never do such a thing (213e). Wondering why {{everyone}} seems sober, Alcibiades is informed of the night's agreement (213e, c); after saying his drunken ramblings should not be placed next to the sober orations of the rest, and that he hopes no one believed a word Socrates said, Alcibiades proposes to offer an encomium to Socrates (214c-e).|$|E
25|$|In an anecdotal account, Simmons {{reported}} that a female marsh harrier courted a male to obtain access to food he had stored. She then took this food and fed it to chicks that had been fathered by another male. More extensive studies focused on possibly deceitful behaviour in the pied flycatcher, a species in which males may possess more than one territory. Females gain from mating with a male that has no other mates and males may try to deceive females about their mating status (mated or unmated). Females frequently visit the male, and if <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> alone on his territory he is probably unmated. Thus, by repeated sampling of male behaviour, females are usually able to avoid mating with previously mated males.|$|E
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> {{interested}} in low cost housing, he stated {{in an interview}} with John Walsh: ...|$|R
60|$|She {{had always}} the same effect upon him, the effect of being {{suddenly}} remembered. When <b>he</b> <b>was</b> away from her <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> sure {{that she was a}} beautiful woman, and when he saw her again <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> astonished to see how little he had borne her beauty in mind. For a moment they regarded one another silently. Then she {{closed the door behind her}} and came towards him.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> dreaming; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{a dreamer}} from birth, and this {{characteristic}} {{got him into}} trouble now and then.|$|R
