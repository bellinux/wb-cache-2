40|$|Abstract We {{report on}} a {{comparison}} between space weather events that occurred around <b>the</b> two <b>peaks</b> in <b>the</b> sunspot number (SSN) during solar cycle 24. <b>The</b> two SSN <b>peaks</b> occurred in <b>the</b> years 2012 and 2014. Even though SSN was larger <b>during</b> <b>the</b> second <b>peak,</b> we find {{that there were more}} space weather events <b>during</b> <b>the</b> first <b>peak.</b> <b>The</b> space weather events we considered are large solar energetic particle (SEP) events and major geomagnetic storms associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We also considered interplanetary type II radio bursts, which are indicative of energetic CMEs driving shocks. When we compared the CME properties between <b>the</b> two SSN <b>peaks,</b> we find that more energetic CMEs occurred <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 2012 <b>peak.</b> In particular, we find that CMEs accompanying IP type II bursts had an average speed of 1543 km/s <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 2012 <b>peak</b> compared to 1201 km/s <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 2014 <b>peak.</b> This result is consistent with the reduction in the average speed of the general population of CMEs <b>during</b> <b>the</b> second <b>peak.</b> All SEP events were associated with the interplanetary type II bursts, which are better than halo CMEs as indicators of space weather. The comparison between <b>the</b> two <b>peaks</b> also revealed <b>the</b> discordant behavior between the CME rate and SSN was more pronounced <b>during</b> <b>the</b> second <b>peak.</b> None of <b>the</b> 14 disk-center halo CMEs was associated with a major storm in 2014. The lone major storm in 2014 was due to the intensification of the (southward) magnetic field in the associated magnetic cloud by a shock that caught up and propagated into the magnetic cloud. © 2015 BBSCS RN SWS.

5|$|According to the {{economic}} theory behind congestion pricing, {{the objective of this}} policy is the use of the price mechanism to make users more aware of the costs that they impose upon one another when consuming <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> demand, and that they should pay for the additional congestion they create, thus encouraging the redistribution of the demand in space or in time, or shifting it to the consumption of a substitute public good; for example, switching from private transport to public transport.|$|E
5|$|August 10, 1976– Prior to {{the arrival}} of Hurricane Belle from the south, 250,000 {{evacuate}} from the shore <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> of the tourist season. While paralleling the coast just offshore, it causes winds of 65mph (105km/h) and gusts of up to 90mph (145km/h), along with a maximum rainfall total of 3.93inches (9.98cm) in Cape May Court House. In addition, the hurricane causes a storm surge of 8.85feet (2.70m) in Atlantic City. However, damage is less than expected, and no deaths occur.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{population}} live in poverty, occupied in farming or raising livestock. Some have moved to the cities to seek {{a higher standard of}} living, returning to help <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> periods of agricultural activity.

5|$|On August 8, 2001, NOAA revised {{its season}} {{estimate}} slightly upwards to nine to twelve named storms, of which 6 to 8 {{were to be}} hurricanes, and 2 to 4 major hurricanes. The agency noted that sea surface temperatures continued to be favorable for above-average hurricane activity, and due to the likelihood that El Nino would not develop <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> of the season, there was a reduced likelihood of a below-average year.|$|E
5|$|On August9, 2007, NOAA revised {{its season}} {{estimate}} slightly downwards to 13 to 16named storms of which seven to nine {{were to be}} hurricanes and three to five major hurricanes.

In addition to one-way and round-trip tickets QuickLink offers monthly and 10-trip passes. Passes and tickets on QuickLink are flexible and passengers can board any bus with available seating. Currently the only QuickLink route is between Mt. Laurel, New Jersey and New York City. Routes were formerly operated from Sacramento, California to the San Francisco Bay Area and Macon, Georgia to Atlanta.|$|E
5|$|The area {{also has}} many {{opportunities}} for both alpine and Nordic skiing. The bowl of Tuckerman Ravine {{is famous for its}} extremely steep backcountry skiing. Long lines are common <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> spring-skiing season of April and May. Wildcat Mountain offers groomed ski trails and lifts, and is a better choice for less-experienced skiers. The centerpiece of the ski-area is the gondola, which runs during the summer, and offers views of the Presidentials with no expended effort.|$|E

5|$|The {{increase}} {{in the price of}} kelp, {{as a result of the}} Napoleonic Wars, was the only thing keeping Rùm's economy afloat. Inevitably, when the Napoleonic Wars ended, the kelp price collapsed, causing severe financial hardship.

He decided to evict the tenants, and lease the whole island to a relative, Dr Lachlan Maclean.|$|E
5|$|The {{siege of}} Dubrovnik and the {{associated}} blockade running operations of the squadron took place from September 1991 until May 1992, <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> of the fighting in the Croatian War of Independence.

In early 1992, the Dubrovnik area saw fierce fighting while combat operations largely ceased elsewhere in Croatia following the Sarajevo Agreement of 2 January 1992.|$|E
5|$|With {{increased}} traffic, there {{soon became}} a capacity problem at Oslo Airport, Fornebu, the main hub for both SAS and Braathens. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> times during the morning and afternoon rush, there were no excess slots for new airlines. To compensate, the Norwegian Airport Administration was building a new main airport for Eastern Norway, to be located at Gardermoen. A larger terminal and two runways would give ample room for expansion, and entry of new airlines. The new airport opened on 8 October 1998.|$|E
50|$|The {{frequency}} of {{services of the}} Rhine-Sieg-Express on the Sieg Railway is increased <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>peaks.</b> In <b>the</b> morning two extra trains run to Cologne and in the afternoon two extra trains run from Cologne towards Siegen.
