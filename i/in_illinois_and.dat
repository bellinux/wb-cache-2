5|$|While AASHTO {{guidelines}} specifically prohibit Interstate Highways and U.S. Routes from {{sharing a}} number {{within the same}} state (which is why there are no Interstates 50 or 60), the initial Interstate numbering approved in 1958 violated this with I-24 and US24 <b>in</b> <b>Illinois</b> <b>and</b> I-40, I-80, US40 and US80 in California (US40 and US80 were removed from California in its 1964 renumbering).|$|E
5|$|As {{his father}} was playing for the Chicago Blackhawks, Hull's early life was spent <b>in</b> <b>Illinois,</b> <b>and</b> he first played {{organized}} hockey in the Chicago area {{at the age of}} four. He and his brothers often skated with the Black Hawks where they watched their father play. The family moved back to Canada when Bobby signed with the original Winnipeg Jets in 1972. Brett moved to Vancouver with his mother and two youngest siblings shortly before his parents' acrimonious divorce in 1979. Hull was not close to his father following the breakup, though the two spoke periodically.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1958 season, O'Connell, who {{lacked the}} stature and {{durability}} Paul Brown wanted in a starter, retired {{to take a}} coaching job <b>in</b> <b>Illinois,</b> <b>and</b> Milt Plum was named as his replacement. Cleveland, however, was relying increasingly on the running game, in contrast to its pass-happy early years under Graham. As the team built up a 9–3 regular-season record, Brown in 1958 ran for 1,527yards – almost {{twice as much as}} any other back and a league record at the time.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, she {{graduated}} with a Bachelor of Arts, with departmental honors in political science. After some fellow seniors requested that the college administration allow a student speaker at commencement, {{she became the first}} student in Wellesley College history to speak at the event. Her address followed that of commencement speaker Senator Edward Brooke. After her speech, she received a standing ovation that lasted seven minutes. She was featured in an article published in Life magazine, due to the response to a part of her speech that criticized Senator Brooke. She also appeared on Irv Kupcinet's nationally syndicated television talk show as well as <b>in</b> <b>Illinois</b> <b>and</b> New England newspapers. That summer, she worked her way across Alaska, washing dishes in Mount McKinley National Park and sliming salmon in a fish processing cannery in Valdez (which fired her and shut down overnight when she complained about unhealthful conditions).|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of Isabel, Governor Ed Rendell {{declared}} a state of emergency for the state. The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency activated a support team to assist Urban Search and Rescue operations as part of the threat from the storm. The state's National Guard placed 2,990guardsmen on Emergency Condition 5 status to be deployed anywhere in the state for emergency support, with other guardsmen readying equipment such as generators, heavy trucks, water trailers, and engineer equipment for deployment. State police officers were readied for deployment, while the state health department contacted hospitals to ensure generators were in working condition. The state Environmental Protection Agency prepared for the storm by monitoring the status of all dams, water treatment facilities, and nuclear plants. In addition, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission stationed extra workers to patrol the highways in poor drainage areas, with extra equipment prepared for quick response for potential road blockage. Prior {{to the arrival}} of the storm, officials from PECO Energy prepared its largest workforce in its history with 1,500workers, including employees from Commonwealth Edison <b>in</b> <b>Illinois</b> <b>and</b> Detroit Edison.|$|E

5|$|The attacks {{followed}} {{an increase in}} tension after the Hall sisters were released at Fort Blue Mounds on June 1. The sisters had been kidnapped during the Indian Creek massacre in May and were brought to Blue Mounds by a party of Ho-Chunk. Militia leader Henry Dodge became suspicious of the Ho-Chunk and took them prisoner, though they were later released as tension between the Ho-Chunk and white settlers increased. The attacks also lent credence {{to the belief that}} more Ho-Chunk were set to join Black Hawk's war against white settlers <b>in</b> <b>Illinois</b> <b>and</b> Michigan Territory. Though other attacks on the fort were expected they never happened and Fort Blue Mounds served as a supply center for the remaining days of the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{warning was}} appropriate, {{for in the}} Congressional elections, Republicans won their biggest {{landslide}} in decades, taking full control of the House, while the Populists lost most of their support. Cleveland's factional enemies gained control of the Democratic Party in state after state, including full control <b>in</b> <b>Illinois</b> <b>and</b> Michigan, and made major gains in Ohio, Indiana, Iowa and other states. Wisconsin and Massachusetts {{were two of the}} few states that remained under the control of Cleveland's allies. The Democratic opposition were close to controlling two-thirds of the vote at the 1896 national convention, which they needed to nominate their own candidate. They failed for lack of unity and a national leader, as Illinois governor John Peter Altgeld had been born in Germany and was ineligible to be nominated for President.|$|E
5|$|When Atkinson {{arrived at}} Fort Armstrong on Rock Island on April 12, {{he learned that}} the British Band was <b>in</b> <b>Illinois,</b> <b>and</b> that most of the Meskwakis he wanted to arrest were now with the band. Like other American officials, Atkinson was {{convinced}} that the British Band intended to start a war. Because he had few troops at his disposal, Atkinson hoped to get support from the Illinois state militia. He wrote to Governor Reynolds on April 13, describing—and perhaps purposely exaggerating—the threat that the British Band posed. Reynolds, who was eager for a war to drive the Indians out of the state, responded as Atkinson had hoped: he called for militia volunteers to assemble at Beardstown by April 22 to begin a thirty-day enlistment. The 2,100 men who volunteered were organized into a brigade of five regiments under Brigadier General Samuel Whiteside. Among the militiamen was 23-year-old Abraham Lincoln, who was elected captain of his company.|$|E

5|$|In {{part due}} to the ongoing violent {{political}} confrontations in the Kansas, opposition to the Kansas-Nebraska Act remained strong <b>in</b> <b>Illinois</b> <b>and</b> throughout the North. As the 1856 elections approached, Lincoln abandoned the defunct Whig Party in favor of the Republicans. He attended the May 1856 Bloomington Convention, which formally established the Illinois Republican Party. The convention platform asserted that Congress had the right to regulate slavery in the territories and called for the immediate admission of Kansas as a free state. Lincoln gave the final speech of the convention, in which he endorsed the party platform and called for the preservation of the Union. At the June 1856 Republican National Convention, Lincoln received significant support on the vice presidential ballot, though the party nominated a ticket of John C. Frémont and William Dayton. Lincoln strongly supported the Republican ticket, campaigning for the party throughout Illinois. The Democrats nominated former Ambassador James Buchanan, who had been out of the country since 1853 and thus had avoided the debate over slavery in the territories, while the Know Nothings nominated former Whig President Millard Fillmore. In the 1856 elections, Buchanan defeated both his challengers, but Frémont won several Northern states and Republican William Henry Bissell won election as Governor of Illinois. Though Lincoln did not himself win office, his vigorous campaigning had made him the leading Republican in Illinois.|$|E
