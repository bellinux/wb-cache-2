40|$|Abstract: <b>Depleted</b> uranium (DU) is an {{emerging}} environmental pollutant that is {{introduced into the}} environment primarily by military activity. While <b>depleted</b> uranium is less radioactive than natural uranium, it still retains all the chemical toxicity associated with the original element. In large doses the kidney is the target organ for the acute chemical toxicity of this metal, producing potentially lethal tubular necrosis. In contrast, chronic low dose exposure to <b>depleted</b> uranium may not produce a clear and defined set of symptoms. Chronic low-dose, or subacute, exposure to <b>depleted</b> uranium alters the appearance of milestones in developing organisms. Adult animals that were exposed to <b>depleted</b> uranium during development display persistent alterations in behavior, even after cessation of <b>depleted</b> uranium exposure. Adult animals exposed to <b>depleted</b> uranium demonstrate altered behaviors {{and a variety of}} alterations to brain chemistry. Despite its reduced level of radioactivity evidence continues to accumulate that <b>depleted</b> uranium, if ingested, may pose a radiologic hazard. The current state of knowledge concerning DU is discussed...|$|R

40|$|This report {{contains}} a cost {{analysis of the}} long-term storage of <b>depleted</b> uranium {{in the form of}} uranium metal. Three options are considered for storage of the <b>depleted</b> uranium. These options are aboveground buildings, partly underground vaults, and mined cavities. Three cases are presented. In the first case, all the <b>depleted</b> uranium metal that would be produced from the conversion of <b>depleted</b> uranium hexafluoride (UF{sub 6 }) generated by the US Department of Energy (DOE) prior to July 1993 would be stored at the storage facility (100 % Case). In the second case, half the <b>depleted</b> uranium metal would be stored at this storage facility (50 % Case). In the third case, one-quarter of the <b>depleted</b> uranium metal would be stored at the storage facility (25 % Case). The technical basis for the cost analysis presented in this report is principally found in the companion report, ANL/EAD/TM- 100, ''Engineering Analysis Report for the Long-Term Management of <b>Depleted</b> Uranium Hexafluoride: Storage of <b>Depleted</b> Uranium Metal'', prepared by Argonne National Laboratory...|$|R

5|$|Agricultural {{runoff from}} farms and ranches in the Snake River Plain {{and many other}} areas has {{severely}} damaged {{the ecology of the}} river throughout the 20thcentury.

Runoff from several feedlots was dumped into the river until laws made the practice illegal.

50|$|<b>Depleted</b> uranium has 40% less {{radioactivity}} than natural uranium, but {{the negative}} effects should not be overlooked.
