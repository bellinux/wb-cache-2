In this context, this article looks for to evidence the use of geoprocessing techniques and remote sensing with sights to the elaboration of the thematic mapping of the Taquari Valley, Rio Grande do Sul, region formed for 37 cities. The cartographic base used to generate the thematic maps had been the topographical maps elaborated by the Geographic Service of the Army, in scale 1 / 50, 000. Images of the Landsat satellite had been used to generate the use and covering of the ground. The data presented in this article made possible to evidence the lack of planning of the use and covering of the ground. The remote sensing and geoprocessing techniques used are important to analyze the landscape and are important in the attempt to surpass the problems of the development and to reduce the deterioration of the ambient quality in the Taquari Valley.

40|$|The main concept behind image mosaic is image registration. In image mosaicing several {{overlapping}} images are assembled {{in order to}} constitute one panoramic image. In this paper a new feature-based approach will be presented for automated image to image registration and mosaicing. The proposed method is implemented on real complex images. The proposed method is based on five main steps. First, the Harris algorithm is used to extract the feature points in the reference and sensed images. Second, feature matching is established using the Euclidean distance of the signature vectors obtained using pulse coupled neural network (PCNN). Third, transformation parameters are obtained using the least-square rule based on general affine transformation. Fourth, the image resampling and transformation are performed using bilinear interpolation to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>registered</b> image. Finally, <b>the</b> mosaicing image is obtained. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed algorithm shows excellent results when applied and tested on real complex images...|$|R
