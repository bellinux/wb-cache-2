40|$|In this study, {{the normal}} and {{frictional}} tool force components were {{measured in the}} veneer cutting without a pressure bar, using the tool with the restricted tool - chip contact length. The factors affecting the veneer quality were discussed {{on the basis of}} the experimental results obtained. The results obtained are summarized as follows : (1) The frictional coefficients (μ) on the interface between the restricted tool and the chip decrease as the tool - chip contact length (l_r) of the restricted tool decreases. The decreasing tendency of μ is more remarkable when cutting water - saturated workpieces than when cutting air - dried ones. These phenomena can be explained qualitatively {{on the basis of the}} stress distributions over the rake face of the restricted tool (Fig. 2). (2) As l_r decreases, the degree of the stress concentrations near the tool edge increases remarkably. The increasing tendency of the normal stress concentration is more remarkable than that of the frictional stress concentration (Figs. 2 - 3). (3) As l_r decreases, the chip curvature and the <b>knife</b> <b>check</b> of the chip decrease (Figs. 4 ～ 5 and Photo. 2) and the surfaces of veneer produced become relatively good (Photo. 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{works have}} been {{performed}} by many researchers {{on the effects of}} cutting velocity in the veneer cutting process, and it is known that these results are different. For instance, some results show practically no effect on cutting force, while others show a gradual increase or a gradual decrease with increase in cutting velocity (V). In the present experiment, veneer cutting tests were performed to obtain fundamental data on the effects of V on cutting force, frictional coefficient (μ), radius of veneer curvature (r) and <b>knife</b> <b>check</b> occurred in veneer by use of an experimental apparatus designed for cutting tests. The main results obtained are summarized as follows : (1) In the range of very low cutting velocity below about 5 m/sec, the frictional force (F) and the normal force (N) of cutting force decrease so remarkably with increase in V. In the range of V of about 5 ～ 12 m/sec, their forces are not affected by V. In the range of V of relatively high cutting velocity above about 12 m/sec, F is not affected by V, but N increases gradually with increase in V. (2) When cutting water-saturated workpieces μ is lower as compared with that when cutting air-dried workpieces, and when cutting not only water-saturated workpieces but also air-dried workpieces μ decreases gradually with increase in V. (3) The radius r increases but knife checks occurred in veneer decreases with increase in V...|$|E
40|$|Sometimes it 2 ̆ 7 s hard to {{tell when}} burgers and {{sausages}} are properly cooked and ready to eat.

25|$|The blade may {{not have}} {{imperfections}} in it. All blades are assumed by Jewish law to be imperfect, so the <b>knife</b> must be <b>checked</b> before each session. In the past the <b>knife</b> was <b>checked</b> {{through a variety of}} means. Today the common practice is for the shochet to run his fingernail up and down both sides of the blade and on the cutting edge to determine if he can feel any imperfections. He then uses a number of increasingly fine abrasive stones to sharpen and polish the blade until it is perfectly sharp and smooth. After the slaughter, the shochet must <b>check</b> the <b>knife</b> again in the same way to be certain the first inspection was properly done, and to ensure the blade was not damaged during shechita. If the blade is found to be damaged, the meat may not be eaten by Jews. If the blade falls or is lost before the second check is done, the first inspection is relied on and the meat is permitted.|$|R
40|$|The {{frictional}} {{behavior on}} the relief face of a veneer cutting tool that takes part in the mechanism of veneer formation and the veneer quality becomes a serious problem of utmost importance. Few fundamental studies have dealt with this problem, and so, the main objective {{of this paper is}} to obtain information on them. In this study, the frictional stress (τ) and the normal stress (σ) over a rake face were measured in the veneer cutting without a pressure bar, using a composite tool with the restricted contact length (γ_c) between the relief face and the machined surface, as shown in Fig. 1. The results obtained are summarized as follows: (1) Two components of the cutting force are affected by γ_c, for instance, the horizontal component increases and the vertical component decreases, with increase in γ_c. (2) The distributions of τ and σ over the rake face can be expressed by Eq. (5). From the values of the coefficients and the exponents in Eq. (5), the effect of γ_c upon τ and σ is made clear (Figs. 2 and 3, and Table 1). (3) The frictional coefficient (μ) on the rake face increases with increase in γ_c, but μ can be considered to be constant under the various cutting conditions (Fig. 4 and Table 3). (4) The degree of <b>knife</b> <b>checks</b> in chip increases, but the loose side surface of the chip produced becomes relatively good, with increase in γ_c. These cutting phenomena are discussed qualitatively on the basis of the above-mentioned results...|$|R

5000|$|Due to {{concerns}} about potential violence at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China began restricting [...] "dangerous knives", requiring that purchasers {{register with the}} government when purchasing these knives. Included in the new restrictions are knives with [...] "blood grooves", lockblade knives, knives with blades measuring over 22 cm (8.6 in) in length, and knives with blades over 15 cm in length also having a point angle of less than 60 degrees. As of January 2011, according to an authorized Leatherman dealer in Beijing all knives with a locking blade are illegal unless {{they are part of}} a larger multi-tool like a leatherman. However, many people still carry locking pocket knives especially when camping with no issues. He suggested carrying locking <b>knives</b> in <b>checked</b> luggage on airplanes, and on your person in trains and subways since they could be confiscated if found in a bag. Foreigners are generally given a bit more leeway in China so if a traveler is caught with a small knife there will probably be no prosecution and at most confiscation.|$|R
25|$|To avoid tearing, and {{to ensure}} the cut is thorough, such {{slaughter}} is usually performed by a trained individual, with a large, razor-sharp <b>knife,</b> which is <b>checked</b> before each killing {{to ensure that it}} has no irregularities (such as nicks and dents); if irregularities are discovered, or the cut is too shallow, the meat is deemed not kosher. Rabbis usually require the slaughterer, known within Judaism as a shochet, to also be a pious Jew of good character and an observer of the Shabbat. In smaller communities, the shochet was often the town rabbi, or a rabbi from a local synagogue, but large slaughterhouses usually employ a full-time shochet if they intend to sell kosher meat.|$|R
60|$|One {{twilight}} {{when he was}} trotting leisurely {{across the}} ranges to give Akela the half of a buck that he had killed, while the Four jogged behind him, sparring a little, and tumbling one another over for joy of being alive, he heard a cry {{that had never been}} heard since the bad days of Shere Khan. It was what they call in the Jungle the pheeal, a hideous kind of shriek that the jackal gives when he is hunting behind a tiger, or when there is a big killing afoot. If you can imagine a mixture of hate, triumph, fear, and despair, with a kind of leer running through it, you will get some notion of the pheeal that rose and sank and wavered and quavered far away across the Waingunga. The Four stopped at once, bristling and growling. Mowgli's hand went to his <b>knife,</b> and he <b>checked,</b> the blood in his face, his eyebrows knotted.|$|R
