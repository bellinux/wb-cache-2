50|$|The pipelined {{datapath}} is {{the most}} commonly used datapath design in microarchitecture today. This technique is used in most modern microprocessors, microcontrollers, and DSPs. The pipelined architecture allows multiple instructions to overlap in execution, much like an assembly line. The pipeline includes several different stages which are fundamental in microarchitecture designs. Some of these stages include instruction <b>fetch,</b> <b>instruction</b> decode, execute, and write back. Some architectures include other stages such as memory access. The design of pipelines is one of the central microarchitectural tasks.|$|E
50|$|The higher-end CPUs {{consisted}} of multiple functional units (e.g., shift, increment, floating add) which allowed {{some degree of}} parallel execution of instructions. This parallelism allowed assembly programmers to minimize {{the effects of the}} system's slow memory fetch time by pre-fetching data from central memory well before that data was needed. By interleaving independent instructions between the memory <b>fetch</b> <b>instruction</b> and the instructions manipulating the fetched operand, the time occupied by the memory fetch could be used for other computation. With this technique, coupled with the handcrafting of tight loops that fit within the instruction stack, a skilled Cyber assembly programmer could write extremely efficient code that made the most {{of the power of the}} hardware.|$|E
30|$|The {{resulting}} miss-cycles are scaled to the bandwidth {{consumed by}} the <b>instruction</b> <b>fetch</b> unit. The result {{is the number of}} cache fill cycles per <b>fetched</b> <b>instruction</b> byte: in other words, the average main memory access time in cycles per instruction byte. A value of 0.1 means that for every 10 <b>fetched</b> <b>instruction</b> bytes, one clock cycle is spent to fill the cache.|$|R
50|$|Both CPUs {{evaluate}} {{branches in}} the decode stage {{and have a}} single cycle <b>instruction</b> <b>fetch.</b> As a result, the branch target recurrence is two cycles long, and the machine always <b>fetches</b> the <b>instruction</b> immediately after any taken branch.

50|$|A {{processor}} {{is said to}} {{be fully}} pipelined if it can <b>fetch</b> an <b>instruction</b> on every cycle. Thus, if some instructions or conditions require delays that inhibit <b>fetching</b> new <b>instructions,</b> the processor is not fully pipelined.|$|R

The first mainstream microprocessors to use some form of instruction prefetch were the Intel 8086 (six bytes) and the Motorola 68000 (four bytes).

40|$|Pipelining {{has become}} a common {{technique}} to increase throughput of the instruction <b>fetch,</b> <b>instruction</b> decode, and instruction execution portions of modern comput-ers. Branch instructions disrupt the flow of instructions through the the pipeline, increasing the overall execution cost of branch instructions. Three schemes {{to reduce the cost}} of branches are presented {{in the context of a}} gen-eral pipeline model. Ten realistic Unix domain programs are used to directly compare the cost and performance of the three schemes and the results are in favor of the software-based scheme. For example, the software-based scheme has a cost of 1. 65 cycles/branch vs. a cost of 1. 68 cycles/branch of the best hardware scheme for a highly pipelined processor (11 -stage pipeline). The results are 1. 19 (software scheme) vs. 1. 23 cycles/branch (best hard-ware scheme) for a moderately pipelined processor (5 -stage pipeline). ...|$|E

40|$|Statically-scheduled {{architectures}} such as {{very long}} instruction word (VLIW) architectures use very wide instruction words {{in conjunction with}} high bandwidth to the instruction cache to achieve multiple instruction issue. The encoding used for the instructions can {{have an effect on}} the requirements placed on the <b>instruction</b> <b>fetch</b> and <b>instruction</b> cache hardware. One type of encoding is a compressed encoding, named so because it does not explicitly store NOPs within the wide instruction word.

The uop cache also increases performance by more consistently delivering decoded micro-operations to the backend and eliminating various bottlenecks in the CPU's fetch and decode logic.|$|R

40|$|This work {{proposes a}} new fetch unit model, {{inspired}} in the trace processor [8]. Instead of fetching instruction traces, our fetch unit will <b>fetch</b> <b>instruction</b> streams. An instruction stream is a sequential run of instructions, dened by the starting address and the stream length. All branches {{included in the}} stream {{are assumed to be}} not taken, except for the terminating one, which should be always taken (else, we are terminating the stream prematurely). We will show how stream fetching approaches the four factors determining instruction fetch performance: the width of instructions fetched per cycle, instruction cache misses, branch prediction throughput and branch prediction accuracy. 1 Fetch performance 1. 1 Width of instruction fetch All instructions in a stream are consecutive in memory, and a stream contains no taken branches.

The MIPS processor is separated into five stages: instruction <b>fetch,</b> <b>instruction</b> decode, execution, data memory and write back. The control unit controls the operations performed in these stages.

50|$|A {{branch out}} of the normal {{instruction}} sequence often involves a hazard.

40|$|ASEE 2009 The Pico {{processor}} is a scaled down RISC processor {{hence the}} name “Pico”. Pico processors form an integral part in a network. They act as co-processors to Network processors. The network processors are in-charge of various complex functions such as routing, packet switching, queuing, encryption, decryption, pattern matching, computation and other such tasks. Many Pico processors work in parallel with the network processor, which leads to reduced computing time and improved performance (speed). This in turn increases the processing power of the network processor. One of the main uses of the Pico processor is {{to take care of}} the computation part of the network processor. Our project aims to further improve the performance of the network processor by increasing the processing speed of the Pico processor. We can do this by altering the architecture of the current Pico processors to accommodate a five stage pipeline. By doing so, we can manage to increase the speed of execution of each instruction by up to five times. The five stages which we have incorporated in our architecture are Instruction <b>Fetch,</b> <b>Instruction</b> Decode, Execute, Memory I/O and Write Back.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{was to create a}} {{processor}} using VHDL {{that could be used for}} educational purposes as well as a stepping stone in creating a reconfigurable system for digital signal processing or image processing applications. To do this a subset of MIPS instructions were chosen to demonstrate functionality within a five stage pipeline (instruction <b>fetch,</b> <b>instruction</b> decode, execution, memory, and write back) processor in simulation and in synthesis. A hazard controller was implemented to handle data forwarding and stalling. The basic MIPS architecture was extended by adding singlecycle multiplication functionality and single-cycle SIMD instructions. The architecture contains parameters for easy modification of SIMD units depending on the needs of the processor. The SIMD architecture was designed with distributed memory so that every memory unit received the same address. This simplifies the address logic so that the processor does not have to use a complex addressing mode. The memory can be pictured as row and columns method of access. The SIMD instructions were chosen to be able to perform binary operations to implement future morphological operations and to use the multiply and add operations for implementing MACs to perform convolution and filtering operations in future image processing applications. The board being used to verify the processor was a Xilinx University Program (XUP) board that contains Xilinx Virtex II Pro XC 2 VP 30 FPGA, package FF 896. The maximum number of units that can be instantiated in the FPGA on the XUP board is eight units which would use the entire FPGA slice area. This allows the processor to complete eight sets of 32 -bit data operations per cycle when the SIMD pipeline is full. The design was shown to operate at the maximum speed of 100 MHz and utilize all the area of the FPGA. The processor was verified in both simulation and synthesis. The new soft-core 32 -bit SIMD processor extends existing soft-core processors in that it provides a reconfigurable SIMD-pipeline allowing it to operate on multiple inputs concurrently, with 32 -bit operands and a single-cycle throughput.
