25|$|Patients with variant {{forms of}} the gene CYP2D6 (also called simply 2D6) may not receive <b>full</b> <b>benefit</b> from {{tamoxifen}} because of too slow metabolism of the tamoxifen prodrug into its active metabolites.

25|$|The current {{federal income}} tax law allows {{individuals}} to deduct the home mortgage interest costs from taxable income (unless the taxpayer {{is subject to the}} Alternative Minimum Tax). Home mortgage interest {{is one of the few}} personal expenditures that is treated in this manner. Someone paying a 25% income tax rate would receive $250 back from the government for $1,000 expended in home mortgage interest. While there is no deduction for payroll taxes and most do not itemize the income tax deduction for <b>full</b> <b>benefit,</b> this preferential treatment of mortgage interest encourages households to spend relatively more of their income on housing than would otherwise be the case.|$|E
25|$|Splay : This type of natal chart is {{noteworthy}} {{because of the}} presence of at least two, but usually three pairs (or conjunctions) of planets randomly distributed in a 'splay' shape around the chart. A person with this pattern will have enormous talent and potential that needs deliberate attention to be developed into worthwhile skills. The person will be an individualist, with no desire for a regimented or highly organized way of life, and they will seek to avoid becoming trapped in routine. However, there is often the difficulty that there is a lack of relevance between the different skill sets, so that the person may not derive the <b>full</b> <b>benefit</b> from them. Such a person needs to concentrate on 'getting their act together'.|$|E

25|$|By {{the start}} of the 19th century, the aim of Hungary's {{agricultural}} producers had shifted from subsistence farming and small-scale production for local trade to cash-generating, large-scale production for a wider market. Road and waterway improvements cut transportation costs, while urbanization in Austria, Bohemia, and Moravia and the need for supplies for the Napoleonic wars boosted demand for foodstuffs and clothing. Hungary became a major grain and wool exporter. New lands were cleared, and yields rose as farming methods improved. Hungary did not reap the <b>full</b> <b>benefit</b> of the boom, however, because most of the profits went to the magnates, who considered them not as capital for investment but as a means of adding luxury to their lives. As expectations rose, goods such as linen and silverware, once considered luxuries, became necessities. The wealthy magnates had little trouble balancing their earnings and expenditures, but many lesser nobles, fearful of losing their social standing, went into debt to finance their spending.|$|E
500|$|Later reviews {{were less}} positive. The {{director}} of the Met, James Rorimer, wrote in 1957 that September Morn stood at [...] "different ends of a wide spectrum" [...] than the works of Old Masters and [...] "modern giants", but was important in helping viewers [...] "realize the <b>full</b> <b>benefit</b> of our heritage" [...] in their explorations {{of past and present}} art. That year, the Montreal Gazette art critic opined that the painting was banal and unacceptable for display in the Met's main hall. The reviewer suggested that September Morn, with its [...] "delicate, pearly tonality and simple, sparse, airy composition", would be best served by being displayed among works considered better by early 20th-century collectors but since reviewed poorly, to [...] "dramatiz for the public the danger of too-hasty judgments".|$|E
2500|$|By 2018, it is {{proposed}} to allow one Shinkansen service {{each day to}} travel at [...] (the maximum speed proposed for the tunnel) by ensuring no freight trains are scheduled to travel on the dual gauge section at that time. To achieve the <b>full</b> <b>benefit</b> of Shinkansen trains travelling on the dual gauge section at , other alternatives are being considered, such as a system to automatically slow Shinkansen trains down to [...] when passing narrow-gauge trains, and loading freight trains onto special [...] "Train on Train" [...] standard-gauge trains (akin to a covered piggyback flatcar train) built to withstand the shock wave of oncoming Shinkansen trains traveling at full speed. This would enable a travel time from Tokyo to Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto of 3 hours and 45 minutes, a saving of 17 minutes on the current timetable.|$|E

"The issue {{revolved}} around Queen refusing {{to go on}} at their allotted time because the light wasn't right - I remember it was sundown, so whoever went on stage wouldn't get the <b>full</b> <b>benefit</b> of their light show. It came down to a battle between management, which then spilled into a fracas between the roadies of our respective bands, as each crew jostled to set gear up. The MC (or some other promoter) goaded the crowd into an us and them vibe, with the local band in favour over the unknown [...] "pommie bastards". It ended with us going on stage first, and Queen redeeming themselves to the crowd and showing a hint {{of what they were}} to become. And that is how I remember it".- Kerry McKenna, bass guitarist for Madder Lake.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{the home}} {{mortgage}} interest deduction, charitable giving receives preferential treatment under current tax law allowing individuals to deduct the donation, to certain charities, from taxable income. Someone paying a 25% {{income tax rate}} would receive $250 back from the government for a $1,000 donation. While there is no deduction for payroll taxes and most do not itemize the deduction for <b>full</b> <b>benefit,</b> this encourages households to donate more of their income to charity than would otherwise be the case. As the FairTax would only tax new retail purchases, donations to charity would be made with untaxed income (comparable to a deduction on both income and payroll taxes). [...] The FairTax would also remove the prohibition of political speech by non-profits, therefore removing the threat to non-profit status. Taxable property and services purchased by a qualified non-profit or religious organization 'for business purposes' would not be taxable.|$|E
2500|$|Normally, the gas {{used for}} dry suit {{inflation}} is {{air from the}} primary breathing cylinder. [...] Helium-based gas mixes such as trimix or heliox are avoided for suit inflation because of helium's high thermal conductivity. Nitrox blends from a decompression cylinder have essentially the same thermal conductivity as air but oxygen rich mixes introduce a fire hazard when out of the water. Using a small (1-2 litre), dedicated cylinder avoids these complications; usually this will contain air but argon may be used instead. [...] Argon has a low thermal conductivity, which improves insulation by approximately 20% compared to air, without adding any bulk or weight. Unfortunately, the accidental breathing of pure argon results in rapid unconsciousness and probable death. [...] Consequently, argon cylinders must be clearly marked to prevent the accidental attachment of a breathing regulator or have valves that cannot accept a breathing regulator. To gain the <b>full</b> <b>benefit</b> of argon the suit must be flushed with argon before the dive to remove the air.|$|E
