5|$|Filmed in Canada, {{principal}} photography {{took place}} in Montreal, Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, and several other Quebec locations {{during the summer and}} autumn of 1999. In January 1999, Travolta flew his private Boeing 727 on a secret visit to Montreal to scout out locations for shooting. The film was reported to have been the most expensive production shot in Canada up to that point. It was also reported that the production costs would have been twice as high had the film been shot in the United States. Almost <b>every</b> <b>shot</b> in the film is at a Dutch angle, because, according to Roger Christian, he wanted the film to look like a comic book.|$|E
5|$|Although {{credited}} as an assistant, the film's art direction {{was done}} by Perry Ferguson. Welles and Ferguson got along during their collaboration. In the weeks before production began Welles, Toland and Ferguson met regularly to discuss the film and plan <b>every</b> <b>shot,</b> set design and prop. Ferguson would take notes during these discussions and create rough designs of the sets and story boards for individual shots. After Welles approved the rough sketches, Ferguson made miniature models for Welles and Toland to experiment on with a periscope in order to rehearse and perfect each shot. Ferguson then had detailed drawings made for the set design, including the film's lighting design. The set design {{was an integral part}} of the film's overall look and Toland's cinematography.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} over five weeks, {{on the outskirts of}} Dallas, Texas. The film was produced on a budget of only USD$7,000, and a skeleton crew of five. Carruth acted as writer, director, producer, cinematographer, editor, and music composer. He also stars in the film as Aaron, and many of the other characters are played by his friends and family. The small budget required conservative use of the Super 16mm filmstock: the carefully limited number of takes resulted in an extremely low shooting ratio of 2:1. <b>Every</b> <b>shot</b> in the film was meticulously storyboarded on 35mm stills. Carruth created a distinctive flat, overexposed look for the film by using fluorescent lighting, non-neutral color temperatures, high-speed film stock, and filters.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{script was}} laid out similar to a comic book, with {{pictures}} {{on the left and}} dialog and descriptions on the right. Jeunet planned <b>every</b> <b>shot,</b> which made it easier for visual effects artists to do their work. Blue Sky Studios was hired to create the first CGI Aliens to appear on film. Impressed with the company's work on Joe's Apartment creating CGI cockroaches, Jeunet and Pitof opted to hire the company to create 30 to 40 shots of CGI Aliens. The decision was made to use CGI Aliens rather than puppets or suited actors whenever the creatures' legs were in frame, as Jeunet felt that a man in a suit is easy to distinguish when the full body is seen.|$|E
5|$|The {{severing}} of workers' hands achieved particular international notoriety. These {{were sometimes}} {{cut off by}} rogue Force Publique soldiers who were made to account for <b>every</b> <b>shot</b> they fired by bringing back {{the hands of their}} victims. These details were recorded by Christian missionaries working in the Congo and caused public outrage when they were made known to the public in the United Kingdom, Belgium, the United States and elsewhere. An international campaign against the Congo Free State began in 1890 and reached its apogee after 1900 under the leadership of the British activist E. D. Morel. In 1908, as a result of international pressure, the Belgian government annexed the Congo Free State to form the Belgian Congo, and ended many of the systems responsible for the abuses. The size of the population decline during the period is the subject of extensive historiographical debate, and there is an open debate as to whether the atrocities constitute genocide.|$|E

25|$|The {{revolver}} {{allows the}} user to fire multiple rounds without reloading after <b>every</b> <b>shot,</b> unlike older rifles and single shot firearms. After a round is fired the hammer is either cocked by the shooter manually or by rearward movement of the trigger to turn the next chamber {{in line with the}} barrel.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, Reid {{played in}} what {{is thought to be}} the first cricket match at the South Pole, with the striped barber's-type pole with a silver {{reflecting}} glass ball on top representing the actual Pole acting as the wicket. The match ended when Reid hit a six and the ball was unable {{to be found in the}} snow of the outfield. It has been noted that <b>every</b> <b>shot</b> he played, no matter where he hit it, travelled north.|$|E
25|$|DAO {{firearms}} resolve some DA/SA shortcomings {{by making}} <b>every</b> <b>shot</b> a double-action shot. Because {{there is no}} difference in pull weights, training and practice are simplified. Additionally, negligent discharges are mitigated due to a heavier trigger pull. This is a particular advantage for a police pistol. These weapons also generally lack any type of external safety. DAO is common among police agencies and for small, personal protection firearms. The primary drawback is that additional trigger pull weight and travel required for each shot reduce accuracy.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the small}} budget, the entire climax was shot with a single camera and this led to <b>every</b> single <b>shot</b> being filmed {{three or four times}} to give the feel of {{multiple}} angles.|$|R
50|$|Locke was not {{particularly}} long from the tee, but placed great emphasis on accuracy in hitting fairways and greens; he employed an extreme right-to-left ball flight (one that bordered on a hook) on nearly <b>every</b> full <b>shot.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} this, called {{multimodal}} transcription, {{is used in}} cinema. A film is broken down into frames, <b>shots</b> or phases. <b>Every</b> frame, <b>shot</b> or phase is analyzed, looking for all the semiotic modalities operating within each one.|$|R
25|$|He {{made his}} maiden ODI hundred, 146 from just 130 balls {{including}} 5 sixes and 12 fours, in the Super 8 game against West Indies on 10 April 2007. He had to bat with a runner {{for the latter}} stages of his innings and found <b>every</b> <b>shot</b> painful due {{to a combination of}} cramps, heat exhaustion and dehydration. His innings consisted of a second wicket partnership of 170 with Jacques Kallis and a third wicket partnership of 70 with Herschelle Gibbs. De Villiers' innings helped set up a total of 356/4 from 50 overs.|$|E
25|$|In {{common with}} the other de Bange cannons, the 155 L had a hooped steel {{construction}} with gain-twist rifling. In its original (1877) conception, the cannon required a wooden platform from which to fire. Its recoil was absorbed simply by friction with the platform, and the 155 L had to be pushed back into position after <b>every</b> <b>shot.</b> In 1883, the Saint-Chamond hydraulic brake was introduced to better absorb recoil. This brake was a separate piece of equipment that anchored the cannon's carriage to the firing platform and returned it into position after about 110cm of recoil.|$|E
25|$|During {{an impromptu}} {{interview}} upon his {{exit from the}} treatment center in 1955, Lugosi stated {{that he was about}} to go to work on a new Ed Wood film, The Ghoul Goes West. This was one of several projects proposed by Wood, including The Phantom Ghoul and Dr. Acula. With Lugosi in his famed Dracula cape, Wood shot impromptu test footage, with no storyline in mind, in front of Tor Johnson's home, a suburban graveyard and in front of Lugosi's apartment building on Carlton Way. This footage ended up in Plan 9 from Outer Space, which was mostly filmed after Lugosi's death. Wood hired Tom Mason, his wife's chiropractor, to double for Lugosi in additional shots. Mason was noticeably taller and thinner than Lugosi, and had the lower half of his face covered with his cape in <b>every</b> <b>shot,</b> as Lugosi sometimes did in Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein.|$|E

25|$|Safina is an {{aggressive}} baseliner {{who likes to}} take {{the ball on the}} rise with full power on <b>every</b> <b>shot.</b> Her sharp angled forehand can force a return that she can hit with a big and heavy forehand for a winner. Her backhand can be flat, heavy, and devastating. She boasts a powerful first serve that sometimes lacks consistency in tight moments. Her primary weakness is her mental toughness, particularly in Grand Slam finals, although it has improved. Her emotions on court can hurt her game. A tenacous fighter, Safina made several notable comebacks, including at the 2008 French Open: down 6–7, 2–5 against Maria Sharapova, she fought off match point and won 6–7, 7–6, 6–2. She was also {{regarded as one of the}} most healthy and fit players on tour. Though an adequate lateral mover, she is less nimble moving forward and tends to avoid net play.|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity in aerial combat, at grave risk of {{his life}} {{above and beyond the}} call of duty, as section leader and pilot of Fighting Squadron 3 on February 20, 1942. Having lost the assistance of his teammates, Lieutenant O'Hare interposed his fighter between his ship and an advancing enemy formation of 9 attacking twin-engine heavy bombers. Without hesitation, alone and unaided, he repeatedly attacked this enemy formation, at close range in the face of intense combined machine gun and cannon fire. Despite this concentrated opposition, Lieutenant O'Hare, by his gallant and courageous action, his extremely skillful marksmanship in making the most of <b>every</b> <b>shot</b> of his limited amount of ammunition, shot down 5 enemy bombers and severely damaged a sixth before they reached the bomb release point. As a result of his gallant action—one of the most daring, if not the most daring, single action in the history of combat aviation—he undoubtedly saved his carrier from serious damage.|$|E
25|$|While {{planning}} the film, director Ron Howard decided that <b>every</b> <b>shot</b> {{of the film}} would be original and that no mission footage would be used. The spacecraft interiors were constructed by the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center's Space Works, which also restored the Apollo 13 Command Module. Two individual Lunar Modules and two Command Modules were constructed for filming. While each was a replica, composed {{of some of the}} original Apollo materials, they were built so that different sections were removable, which enabled filming to take place inside the capsules. Space Works also built modified Command and Lunar Modules for filming inside a Boeing KC-135 reduced-gravity aircraft, and the pressure suits worn by the actors, which are exact reproductions of those worn by the Apollo astronauts, right down to the detail of being airtight. When the actors put the suits on with their helmets locked in place, air was pumped into the suits to cool them down and allow them to breathe, exactly as in launch preparations for the real Apollo missions.|$|E

50|$|However, historians such as Allen C. Guelzo reject this {{traditional}} criticism of Civil War infantry tactics. Casualty estimates compared with expended ammunition from battles indicate 1 casualty for <b>every</b> 250-300 <b>shots</b> discharged, not a dramatic improvement over Napoleonic casualty rates. No contemporary accounts indicate that engagement ranges with substantial casualties between infantry occurred at ranges beyond Napoleonic engagement ranges.|$|R
50|$|The Fierlingers {{drew and}} painted about 60,000 {{drawings}} for the film, which comprises about 460 scenes and about 600 individual background paintings. The film includes 116,640 frames, with <b>every</b> frame <b>shot</b> twice, making 12 original frames for each second of projection time or 720 drawings per minute. At {{a length of}} 81 minutes, the film includes 58,320 drawings.|$|R
