The motivation for the imposition of these barriers {{does not appear to have}} arisen from producers’ requests or consumer lobbying – political precaution provides the motivation. There appears to be little control over political precaution in the rules of international trade. Hence, the balance between the strong rules of trade desired by firms wishing to engage in international commerce and the need, at times, for politicians to respond to requests for protection may be changing in favour of more protection.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of trade {{restrictions}} and illegal trade on price disparities within Nigeria, where {{a long list of}} import prohibitions on various consumer goods have raised the price of the consumption basket. Large-scale illegal trade at the border with Benin allows traders bypass these prohibitions. We investigate whether this illegal trade mitigates {{the impact of}} <b>import</b> <b>bans</b> on domestic prices. Using a simple theoretical model and monthly price data, we exploit changes in the prohibition list, as well as spatial variation between border and non-border states, to identify the effect of smuggling. Results indicate that, for agricultural goods in particular, the price hike associated with an <b>import</b> <b>ban</b> is lower in border states. However, we find little evidence that bans disrupt the cointegration relationship between states. These results are consistent with a large diffusion of smuggled goods across Nigerian states, and with the higher price elasticity to distance in the illegal trade sector.

40|$|This ban {{comes into}} force with {{immediate}} effect on Friday 22 July 2011. Phenazepam is a benzodiazepine which is currently not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (1971 Act) in the UK. Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs's advice: The UK Government has received independent expert advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) that phenazepam is sufficiently harmful to justify an immediate <b>import</b> <b>ban</b> under the Open <b>General</b> <b>Import</b> Licence pending its control as a Class C drug under the 1971 Act. The ACMD’s assessment reports that phenazepam is being marketed as a so called ‘legal high’ product, particularly on the internet. It {{has been identified as}} being a potent member of the benzodiazepine family causing harms such as amnesia and drowsiness that may potentially proceed to a coma with respiratory depression. Whilst phenazepam has been recognised to have limited medicinal properties, it is not prescribed in the UK for treatment neither does it have a UK marketing authorisation. Further, it has no legitimate commercial or industrial uses in the UK. This amendment to the Open <b>General</b> <b>Import</b> Licence will remain in place until such time as it is revoked. This will likely occur when phenazepam is fully controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 where it will be a criminal offence to unlawfully import, export, supply, offer to supply, possess with intent to supply and be in simple possession of this substance without a licence or lawful authority.
