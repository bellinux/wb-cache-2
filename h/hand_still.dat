5|$|The central {{feature of}} the {{monument}} depicts the theme {{of a young man}} called from civil life to serve his nation in a time of need and it transforms the theme into a contemporary allegory. It captures the decisive moment as farmer is caught mid-transition, with his left <b>hand</b> <b>still</b> on the plow handle, and taking the sword with his right hand from Liberty. The details of the farmer includes realistic work clothes, a yoked shirt with rolled sleeves and work trousers tucked into his boots. Liberty, identified by her Phrygian cap, stands just above the farmer in classical robes with a breastplate, sandals and cloak. Her face is impassive as she bestows the sword upon the farmer with her left hand while her right hand holds her pike.|$|E

However, the injury still severely limited Demeter's play {{all the way to}} September.|$|E
25|$|The taller {{of the two}} Artemis statues, a quiver strap runs diagonally {{over the}} figure's right {{shoulder}} and under her left arm. There is a trace of lead solder on the strap on the statue’s back, which shows where the quiver was attached. Her <b>hand</b> <b>still</b> contains a lump of clay {{that was used to}} anchor her bow. There are also two small, bronze remnants of a phiale (offering bowl) that she would have held in her upturned right hand. This stance is in fact one of the stances in which Artemis and Apollo were often portrayed in Greek art.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, AI founder Marvin Minsky asked [...] "So the {{question}} is why didn't we get HAL in 2001?" [...] Minsky believed that the answer is that the central problems, like commonsense reasoning, were being neglected, while most researchers pursued things like commercial applications of neural nets or genetic algorithms. John McCarthy, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>still</b> blamed the qualification problem. For Ray Kurzweil, the issue is computer power and, using Moore's Law, he predicted that machines with human-level intelligence will appear by 2029. Jeff Hawkins argued that neural net research ignores the essential properties of the human cortex, preferring simple models that have been successful at solving simple problems. There were many other explanations and for each there was a corresponding research program underway.|$|E

500|$|Other {{crew members}} accept the cancellation, but Shatner and Nimoy try {{to hang on}} to their Star Trek personae as Kirk and Spock. However, Nimoy is {{eventually}} reduced to a sobbing, nervous wreck, and is carried off the set. Shatner remains defiantly in the Captain's chair, as Herb Goodman mentions to Shatner he {{got a phone call from}} a margarine company. Finally, the set is completely dismantled, and still in his chair, Shatner, as Captain Kirk, makes a final entry into his log recalling his previous three years of space exploration, concluding: [...] "And except for one television network, we have found intelligence everywhere in the galaxy." [...] Raising his hand in the Vulcan salute, he goes on, [...] "Live long and prosper". Then he brings his fingers together, his <b>hand</b> <b>still</b> raised, and adds, [...] "Promise".|$|E
500|$|They reached 2/125 after lunch, when Comptonwho was on 39aimed a hard {{cut shot}} from Johnston's bowling, which flew {{off the edge}} into Lindwall's left hand at second slip for a [...] "freak slip catch". This {{triggered}} a collapse late in the afternoon, which saw the hosts lose 4/25 to end the third day at 7/178. England resumed on the fourth morning with only three wickets in <b>hand,</b> <b>still</b> needing 159 runs to make Bradman’s men bat again. Johnston quickly removed the last three wickets, Alec Bedser, Yardley and Eric Hollies to seal an Australian victory by an innings and 149 runs. Only ten runs were added in the brief morning session; Hollies fell for a golden duck after skying a ball to Morris, immediately after Yardley became the ninth man to fall. Johnston ended with 4/40 from 27.3 overs {{and he was the}} most economical of the bowlers. Given the time lost to inclement weather on the first day, Australia had won the match in less than three days of playing time. Overall, Johnston finished with 27 Test wickets at an average of 23.33, equal to Lindwall but at a higher average.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{recognition and}} renown of Astral Weeks came to overshadow Morrison's subsequent work, {{as well as}} Morrison himself. According to biographer Johnny Rogan, his recording career was [...] "all too often crystallized in a single moment. Like the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, Astral Weeks was perceived as a one-off whose critical standing allowed little discussion for other equally fascinating musical forays that followed." [...] Morrison felt annoyed by the retrospective acclaim and claims about the record's significance. In agreement with Logan's original criticism, he later said he should have [...] "changed the arrangements because the arrangements are too samey ... four or five other songs {{should have had a}} change of mood." [...] Merenstein, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>still</b> admires the album: [...] "To this day it gives me pain to hear it. Pain is the wrong word—I'm so moved by it." [...] In 2001, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, having shipped 500,000 copies in the US. Music historian Andrew Ford said the album's commercial performance, much like its musical aesthetic, is similar to classical music: [...] "Neither instant nor evanescent: Astral Weeks will sell as many copies this year as it did in 1968 and has every year in between".|$|E

2500|$|Having {{lost most}} upper-class players to service in World War II, the 1942 Florida Gators brought an inexperienced 3–4 squad into Jacksonville for the 1942 contest with Georgia. [...] The Bulldogs, {{on the other}} <b>hand,</b> <b>still</b> had many veteran players thanks to the draft deferments of the players who were {{enrolled}} in the University of Georgia's ROTC program, and brought a 7–0 record and No. 1 ranking to Jacksonville.|$|E

2500|$|On a space station, space captain Lincoln F. Sternn is {{on trial}} for {{numerous}} serious charges presented by the prosecutor. Pleading [...] "not guilty" [...] {{against the advice of}} his lawyer, Sternn explains that he expects to be acquitted because he bribed a witness Hanover Fiste. Fiste takes the stand, but his perjury is subverted when the Loc-Nar, now the size of a marble, causes him to blurt out the truth about Sternn's evil deeds. Fiste rants with such fury that he changes into a muscled giant and chases Sternn throughout the station, breaking through bulkheads and wreaking havoc. Eventually, he corners Sternn, receives his promised payoff, and promptly shrinks back to his gangly original form. Sternn opens a trapdoor under Fiste, ejecting him into space. The Loc-Nar enters Earth's atmosphere with Fiste's flaming <b>hand</b> <b>still</b> clinging to it.|$|E

2500|$|Yang {{was known}} for having a full and fleshy figure, which was a much sought-after quality at the time. She was often {{compared}} and contrasted with Empress Zhao Feiyan, the wife of Emperor Cheng of Han, because Yang {{was known for}} her full build while Empress Zhao was slender. This led to the Four-character idiom yanshou-huanfei ( [...] , literally [...] "slender Yan, plump Huan"), describing the physical range {{of the types of}} beauties. Lychee was a favorite fruit for Yang, and the emperor had the fruit, which was only grown in southern China, delivered by the imperial courier's fast horses, whose riders would take shifts day and night in a Pony Express-like manner, to the capital. (Most historians believe the fruits were delivered from modern Guangdong, but some believe they came from modern Sichuan.) A copy of the outline of her right <b>hand</b> <b>still</b> exists, having been carved on a large stone {{at the site of the}} Xi'an Palace. Yang was also granted use of the Huaqing Pool which had been the exclusive private pool of previous Tang emperors.|$|E
2500|$|British Prime Minister Winston Churchill {{travelled}} to Ankara on 30 January 1943 for {{a conference}} with President İnönu, to urge Turkey's entry into the war on the allied side. [...] Churchill met secretly with İnönü in January 1943, inside a railroad car at the Yenice Station near Adana. However, by December 4–6, 1943, İnönü felt confident enough about {{the outcome of the}} war, that he met openly with Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill at the Second Cairo Conference. Until 1941, both Roosevelt and Churchill had thought that Turkey's continuing neutrality would serve the interests of the Allies by blocking the Axis from reaching the strategic oil reserves of the Middle East. But the early victories of the Axis up to the end of 1942 caused Roosevelt and Churchill to re-evaluate a possible Turkish participation in the war {{on the side of the}} Allies. Turkey had maintained a decently-sized Army and Air Force throughout the war, and Churchill wanted the Turks to open a new front in the Balkans. Roosevelt, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>still</b> believed that a Turkish attack would be too risky, and an eventual Turkish failure would have disastrous effects for the Allies.|$|E
