5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the Lowestoft raid, Admiral Reinhard Scheer began planning another foray <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Sea. He had initially intended to launch the operation in mid-May, but the mine damage to Seydlitz had proved difficult to repair, and Scheer was unwilling {{to embark on a}} major raid without his battlecruiser forces at full strength. At noon on 28 May, the repairs to Seydlitz were finally completed, and the ship returned to the I Scouting Group.|$|E

During this operation, the battlecruiser Seydlitz was damaged by a British mine and {{had to return to}} port prematurely. Due to the poor visibility, the operation was soon called off, leaving the British fleet no time to intercept the raiders.|$|E
