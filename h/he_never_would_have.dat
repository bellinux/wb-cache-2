25|$|In August 2016, Rogen again {{spoke to}} Howard Stern {{about how he}} had felt hurt and {{somewhat}} betrayed back then by Heigl's comments. He went on {{to talk about what}} a great rapport they'd had on set while working together, and that at the time he had even envisioned making many more movies with her. Though Rogen wishes she would have apologized to him personally as opposed to publicly, he affirmed that he still really liked her, and that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> wanted the incident to hurt her career.|$|E
25|$|The second volume, I Am Spock (1995), saw Nimoy {{communicating}} that {{he finally}} realized {{his years of}} portraying the Spock character had led to a much greater identification between the fictional character and himself. Nimoy had much input into how Spock would act in certain situations, and conversely, Nimoy's contemplation of how Spock acted gave him cause to think about things {{in a way that}} <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> thought if he had not portrayed the character. As such, in this autobiography Nimoy maintains that in some meaningful sense he has merged with Spock {{while at the same time}} maintaining the distance between fact and fiction.|$|E

500|$|After {{his third}} retirement, Jordan {{assumed that he}} would be able to return to his front office {{position}} as Director of Basketball Operations with the Wizards. However, his previous tenure in the Wizards' front office had produced the aforementioned mixed results and may have also influenced the trade of Richard [...] "Rip" [...] Hamilton for Jerry Stackhouse (although Jordan was not technically Director of Basketball Operations in 2002). On May 7, 2003, Wizards owner Abe Pollin fired Jordan as Washington's President of Basketball Operations. Jordan later stated that he felt betrayed, and that if he knew he would be fired upon retiring <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> come back to play for the Wizards.|$|E
500|$|Vickers, {{who would}} leave Hendrick Motorsports in 2007 for Red Bull Racing Team, said: [...] "I would {{expect them to}} be a little upset. Jimmie is my friend, my teammate, and he is running for a championship. But he knows just as well as I do that if I wasn't bump-drafting, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had a shot to pass Junior." [...] Additionally, he denied that he drove more aggressively because he was leaving. Third-place {{finisher}} Kurt Busch argued Vickers was in a [...] "Catch-22" [...] situation: [...] "He was trying to help his teammate. It just didn't turn out that way. Vickers was doing the best he could to help the 48. He just didn't anticipate the 8 car blocking as long as he did." [...] Vickers would later receive additional security during the next race weekend.|$|E
500|$|... "I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked" [...] saw the {{departure}} of Stevens, following the breakdown of her marriage with Karev. Series' writer Joan Rater commented on this: [...] "Izzie getting the clean scan back gives Alex the freedom to leave. Because <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> left {{her when she was}} sick, he's a good guy. And I'm not saying that Alex ever consciously thought, I can’t leave her while she's sick, but now that she's not, now that she seems like she's going to get better, it just comes to him. He deserves more. He's a good guy and he deserves more. But loving Izzie showed him that he can be good, is good. So it was a little gift. And when he tells Izzie he's done, he's not bitter or angry, he's just done." [...] The writing of the two-part season six finale, caused struggle to Rhimes. She elaborated on this: ...|$|E

[...] "I wish I had known about all of those head injuries, {{but no one knew}} that. And the people that did know that, they wouldn’t tell anybody," [...] he said. “The game has gotten so violent, so rough. We’re so much more educated on this CTE stuff (chronic traumatic encephalopathy), there’s no way I would ever allow my kids to play football today." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 15, 2007, {{after the}} source's death, Novak said on Meet the Press that the unnamed senator was Thomas Eagleton. Political analyst Bob Shrum says that Eagleton {{would never have}} been {{selected}} as McGovern's running mate if it had been known at the time that Eagleton was the source of the quote: [...] "Boy, do I wish he would have let you publish his name. Then <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been picked as vice president. Because the two things, the two things that happened to George McGovern—two of the things that happened to him— were the label you put on him, number one, and number two, the Eagleton disaster. We had a messy convention, but he could have, I think in the end, carried eight or 10 states, remained politically viable. And Eagleton {{was one of the great}} train wrecks of all time." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, he {{supported}} the failed confirmation of Reagan nominee Robert Bork. He then supported and voted for the appointments of both-Bushes nominees David Souter, Clarence Thomas, John Roberts, and Samuel Alito. In 1993 and 1994, McCain voted to confirm Clinton nominees Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whom he considered to be qualified for the Supreme Court. He would later explain that [...] "under our Constitution, it is the president's call to make." [...] He has made clear, though, that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> nominated Breyer or Ginsburg himself (or Souter or Gerald Ford appointee John Paul Stevens). He also stated some of his favorite past Supreme Court justices include Sandra Day O'Connor, William Rehnquist, and John Marshall. He has described Alito and, especially, John Roberts as currently sitting judges he likes; he said the two [...] "would serve {{as the model for}} my own nominees if that responsibility falls to me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Doctor Who and the Terror of the Autons, {{written by}} Dicks, gives further clarity {{to the history}} between the Doctor and the Master. When the Time Lord (played by David Garth in the {{original}} serial) comes to warn the Doctor, he states [...] "I've come to bring you a warning, {{an old friend of}} yours has arrived on Earth. These days he calls himself The Master." [...] The narrative states that [...] " [...] had been behind several interplanetary wars, always disappearing from the scene before he could be brought to justice. If ever he were caught, his fate would be far worse than the Doctor's exile. Once captured by the Time Lords, the Master's life-stream would be thrown into reverse. Not only would he no longer exist, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> existed." [...] The Doctor asks [...] "Is his TARDIS still working?". The Time Lord replies [...] "I'm afraid so. He got away before it could be de-energised." [...] "Then he was luckier than I" [...] said the Doctor sadly. He had never really got used to his exile. The Time Lord replies [...] "Don't be bitter Doctor, your punishment was comparatively light".|$|E

5000|$|According to the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition: [...] It is the {{crowning}} merit of the Tsar Alexei that he discovered {{so many great}} men (like Fyodor Rtishchev, Ordin, Matveyev, the best of Peter's precursors) and suitably employed them. He {{was not a man}} of superior strength of character, or <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> submitted to the dictation of Nikon. But, on the other hand, he was naturally, if timorously, progressive, or <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> encouraged the great reforming boyar Matveyev.
