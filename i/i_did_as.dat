5|$|If it {{had gone}} by me, it's a two-on-one. So I got a little lucky there, but Derek gave me a great pass and when I got the pass I was moving across. As I skated across, Glenn had to move across the crease and had to open his pads a little. I was really {{trying to get the}} puck on net, and <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>As</b> I went across, Glenn's legs opened. I looked back, and I saw it go in, so I jumped.|$|E
25|$|Like many {{unpublished}} authors, Lee {{was unsure}} of her talents. “I was a first-time writer, so <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>as</b> I was told,” Lee {{said in a}} statement in 2015 about the evolution from Watchman to Mockingbird.|$|E
500|$|In {{his later}} life, Dean {{maintained}} a self-deprecating outlook on his actions in Korea and maintained {{he did not}} feel he deserved the Medal of Honor. Of his time in Korea, Dean later said, [...] "I wouldn't have awarded myself a wooden star for what <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>as</b> a commander." [...] In his autobiography, he opted instead to highlight the command decisions he regretted making and contend, [...] "There were heroes in Korea, but I was not one of them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ozu {{told me to}} come [...] in {{the room}} [...] and circle around. So <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>as</b> I was told, but of course it wasn’t good enough. After the third take, Ozu {{approved}} it… The reason [...] circles around the room once is that she’s nostalgic for all the memories there and she also wants to make sure she’s left nothing behind. He didn’t show each of these things explicitly, but through my smoothly circling the room—through how I moved, through the pacing and the blocking—I think that’s {{what he was trying to}} express. At the time, I didn’t understand. I remember I did it rhythmically: I didn’t walk and I didn’t run; I just moved lightly and rhythmically. As I continued doing it, that’s what it turned into, and Ozu okayed it. Come to think of it, it was that way of walking rhythmically that I think was good. I did it naturally, not deliberately. And of course it was Ozu who helped me do it.|$|E
