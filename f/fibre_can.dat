60|$|The chemist {{must answer}} that. And {{he tells us}} that wood can become lignite, or wood-coal, by parting with its oxygen, {{in the shape of}} {{carbonic}} acid gas, or choke-damp; and then common or bituminous coal, by parting with its hydrogen, chiefly in the form of carburetted hydrogen--the gas with which we light our streets. That is about as much as the unscientific reader need know. But it is a fresh corroboration of the theory that coal has been once vegetable fibre, for it shows how vegetable <b>fibre</b> <b>can,</b> by the laws of nature, become coal. And it certainly helps us to believe that a thing has been done, if we are shown that it can be done.|$|E

5000|$|Ceramic matrix {{composites}} (CMCs) are a {{subgroup of}} composite materials {{as well as}} a subgroup of ceramics. They consist of ceramic fibres embedded in a ceramic matrix, thus forming a ceramic fibre reinforced ceramic (...) material.

60|$|Generally, I think, the {{perception}} of the muscular qualities of the tree trunk incomplete, except in men who have studied the human figure, and in loose expression of those characters, the painter who can draw the living muscle seldom fails; but the thoroughly peculiar lines belonging to woody <b>fibre,</b> <b>can</b> only be learned by patient forest study; and hence in all the trees of the merely historical painters, there is fault of some kind or another, commonly exaggeration of the muscular swellings, or insipidity and want of spring in curvature, or fantasticism and unnaturalness of arrangement, and especially a want of the peculiar characters of bark which express the growth and age of the tree; for bark is no mere excrescence, lifeless and external--it is a skin of especial significance in its indications of the organic form beneath; in places under the arms of the tree it wrinkles up and forms fine lines round the trunk, inestimable in their indication of the direction of its surface; in others, it bursts or peels longitudinally, and the rending and bursting of it are influenced in direction and degree by the under-growth and swelling of the woody fibre, and are not a mere roughness and granulated pattern of the hide. Where there are so many points to be observed, some are almost always exaggerated, and others missed, according to the predilections of the painter. Rembrandt and Albert Durer have given some splendid examples of woody texture, but both miss the grace of the great lines. Titian took a larger view and reached a higher truth, yet (as before noticed) from the habit of drawing the figure, he admits too much flaccidity and bend, and sometimes makes his tree trunks look flexible like sea-weed. There is a peculiar stiffness and spring about the curves of the wood, which separates them completely from animal curves, and which especially defies recollection or invention; it is so subtile that it escapes but too often, even in the most patient study from nature; it lies within the thickness of a pencil line. Farther, the modes of ramification of the upper branches are so varied, inventive, and graceful, that the least alteration of them, even in the measure of a hairbreadth, spoils them; and though it is sometimes possible {{to get rid of a}} troublesome bough, accidentally awkward, or in some minor respects to assist the arrangement, yet so far as the real branches are copied, the hand libels their lovely curvatures even in its best attempts to follow them.|$|E

40|$|One {{particularly}} promising application {{area for}} microstructured optical fibre (MOF) {{technology is the}} development of fibre devices based on nonlinear optical effects. Such <b>fibres,</b> <b>can</b> be used for applications including optical data regeneration, wavelength conversion, optical demultiplexing, and Raman amplification. The usual measure of fibre nonlinearity is the effective nonlinearity gamma. Even though silica is not a particularly nonlinear material (n 2 = 2. 2 x 10 - 20 m 2 /W), the nonlinear properties of silica <b>fibres</b> <b>can</b> be utilized when high light intensities are guided. Microstructured <b>fibres</b> <b>can</b> have a significantly larger NA than solid fibres because the cladding can be mostly comprised of air, and effective nonlinearities as high as gamma = 60 W- 1. km- 1 are possible in pure silica microstructured fibres...|$|R

5000|$|A single {{satellite}} link can span a huge distance {{that would take}} a terrestrial link through many countries and commercial operators.

40|$|Hollow core {{photonic}} bandgap <b>fibres</b> <b>can</b> achieve light {{guidance in}} air, {{which offers a}} number of potential benefits for applications relevant to electro-magnetic remote sensing, including higher nonlinear and damage thresholds for high power beam delivery and operation at wavelengths that are not feasible using conventional fibres. Because they rely on coherent scattering from a highly ordered lattice of air holes as the mechanism of light guidance, bandgap <b>fibres</b> <b>can</b> only operate over a finite range of wavelengths. This paper investigates the parameters affecting the bandwidth of transmission in PBGFs and identifies realistic PBGF structures for wide-bandwidth operation in the SWIR wavelength region...|$|R

50|$|Dark <b>fibre</b> <b>can</b> be used {{to create}} a privately {{operated}} optical fiber network that is run directly by its operator over dark fibre leased or purchased from another supplier, rather than by purchasing bandwidth or leased line capacity.

50|$|Leaky modes {{correspond}} to leaky rays in the terminology of geometric optics.The propagation of light through optical <b>fibre</b> <b>can</b> take place via meridional rays or skew rays. These skew rays suffer only partial reflection while meridional rays are completely guided. Thus the modes allowing propagation of skew rays are called leaky modes. Some optical power is lost into clad due to these modes.|$|E
50|$|The {{prepared}} <b>fibre</b> <b>can</b> now be {{made into}} sheets of paper. A viscous substance called formation aid {{is added to the}} vat with the fibre and water. Formation aid is polyethylene oxide, and it helps slow the flow of water, which gives the paper-maker more time to form sheets. Sheets are formed with multiple thin layers of fibre, one on top of another.|$|E
50|$|Shock, impact, or {{repeated}} cyclic stresses {{can cause}} the laminate to separate at the interface between two layers, a condition known as delamination. Individual <b>fibres</b> <b>can</b> separate from the matrix e.g. fibre pull-out.|$|R
50|$|Reinforcement usually adds {{rigidity}} {{and greatly}} impedes crack propagation. Thin <b>fibres</b> <b>can</b> have very high strength, and provided they are mechanically well {{attached to the}} matrix they can greatly improve the composite's overall properties.|$|R

50|$|Harvesting whole {{flax straw}} and <b>fibre</b> <b>can</b> be a challenge. Whole flax straw is {{historically}} {{left in the}} field to decay over time or raked into piles and burned as it tends to clog farm equipment and thus makes collection difficult. As a result, harvest and post-harvest labor may be lengthy and time consuming if the straw and fibers are constantly clogging the discs of the plow.|$|E
50|$|Coco <b>fibre</b> <b>can</b> harbour {{organisms that}} {{pose a threat}} to the {{biosecurity}} of countries into which it is imported. Coco peat has been imported into New Zealand since about 1989 with a marked increase since 2004. By 2009 a total of 25 new weed species have been found in imported coco peat. The regulations relating to importing coco peat into New Zealand have been amended to improve the biosecurity measures.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{benefit of}} using optical fibre for a {{satellite}} TV IF distribution {{system is that}} the <b>fibre</b> <b>can</b> carry the entire received spectrum on one cable, which can then be split to provide for multiple tuners, without requiring a separate feed from the antenna to each tuner.
