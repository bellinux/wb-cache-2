5|$|English syntax {{relies on}} {{auxiliary}} verbs for many functions including {{the expression of}} tense, aspect and mood. Auxiliary verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb. For example, in the sentence the dog did not <b>find</b> <b>its</b> bone, the clause <b>find</b> <b>its</b> bone is the complement of the negated verb did not. Subject–auxiliary inversion is used in many constructions, including focus, negation, and interrogative constructions.|$|E

Development began in 2011 and the game was formally announced in July 2013 and followed by alpha and Steam Early Access releases. Rætikon was released on April 17, 2014 for Windows, OS X, and Linux platforms. It received mixed reviews from reviewers, who praised its artwork and movement physics, but criticized its inconsistency, lack of cohesion, and technical issues.|$|E

5|$|The Department of Civil Aviation {{performed}} {{tests on}} {{parts of the}} DC-4 fuel system. Tests on the engine fuel system showed that when the engine boost pump was operating, a vortex formed in the engine fuel tank. If {{a small amount of}} water was present, this vortex held the water in suspension and prevented it from entering the engine. The tests also showed that when the boost pump was turned off, the vortex dissipated and any water would soon <b>find</b> <b>its</b> way into the engine. Investigators believed this might explain why all engines were operating normally during the takeoff but at least one engine began to run roughly around the time the engine boost pumps would be turned off.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch Navy {{had already}} {{acquired}} {{a quantity of}} the Hispano Suiza 20mm guns before the war for mounting in torpedo boats and other craft and 6 of these were mounted in the cruiser Jacob van Heemskerck when she made her escape to Britain in 1940. The Hispano fired similar 20 × 110 ammunition to the Oerlikon but had a higher rate of fire and slightly higher muzzle velocity. The Hispano Suiza however was to prove insufficiently durable for shipboard use and would <b>find</b> <b>its</b> niche as a highly successful aircraft gun.|$|E
5|$|The main Allied {{detector}} at {{this time}} was the Magnetic Airborne Detector (MAD). MAD entered service in 1943, only to <b>find</b> <b>its</b> targets had vanished from coastal waters. It was able to plot and recognise distortions in Earth's magnetic field caused by submarines. It took some skill to use and only worked if it was directly above the target. It also was only effective at low altitudes. It had some success in the Gibraltar strait, but was ineffective in British waters owing to different conditions. The only recorded MAD victory in British waters was the sinking of U-1055 on 30 April 1945 off Ushant. Another invention was the American 3-cm radar and sonobuoy. These devices, along with the Mark 24 Mine (Fido), {{was responsible for the}} destruction of U-905 and U-296, sunk by No. 86 Squadron RAF and No. 120 Squadron RAF.|$|E

5|$|The {{objective}} is to fly through the Rætikon environment to <b>find</b> <b>its</b> titular secrets, namely by collecting relics to power an ancient device. The environment is split into themed levels such as swamp, lagoon, mountaintops, and forests. Glowing shards are dispersed throughout each level, which can be collected and redeemed at an altar within each themed level for a glowing relic. These relics can be returned to where the player started the game to power a mysterious, ancient device. The player-character carries the relics past aggressive enemies and treacherous environment, and completes puzzles of reconstructing animal statues from its pieces to access new levels. Each level features different animals and contain environmental objects that player can interact with.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the failure}} to remake the game for the WonderSwan Color, and Square's merger with former {{competitor}} Enix to form Square Enix in , the company posted assurance that the game's promised remake would not be completely forgotten, and there was speculation that it might <b>find</b> <b>its</b> way to Sony's PlayStation or Nintendo's Game Boy Advance as its predecessors had. Square Enix considered porting the game to the PlayStation 2, but was eventually convinced by Nintendo to develop the title for their new handheld system, the Nintendo DS, a decision that would later be positively reinforced by the commercial success of the Nintendo DS. The Final Fantasy III remake was first announced on October 24, 2004, but detailed information did not emerge for a year. Hiromichi Tanaka headed the project as both the executive producer and director. His guidance and supervision were needed because the remake was not a mere graphical update as Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy IIs remakes were, but a total overhaul using the Nintendo DS's 3D capabilities. Along with 3D graphics, a full motion video opening scene was produced for the game, {{similar to those found}} in the ports of the 2D Final Fantasy games for the PlayStation. Programming was handled by developer Matrix Software.|$|E
