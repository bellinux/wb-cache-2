5|$|South-pointing chariot: Although {{the claim}} of Wei Dynasty {{mechanical}} engineer and statesman Ma Jun (fl. 220–265) that the south-pointing chariot was first invented by the mythological Yellow Emperor are dubious, his south-pointing chariot was successfully designed and tested in 255 AD with many later models recreated in subsequent dynasties; this <b>device</b> <b>was</b> a wheeled vehicle with differential gears that ensured a mounted wooden figurine would always point in the southern direction {{no matter how the}} vehicle turned, in essence a non-magnetic compass. The Book of Song written in the 6th century states that the <b>device</b> <b>was</b> successfully reinvented by the mathematician and astronomer Zu Chongzhi (429–500) during the Liu Song Dynasty (420–479). The Japanese historical text Nihon Shoki, compiled by 720, states that the <b>device</b> <b>was</b> crafted and presented as a gift to Emperor Tenji (661–672) on two different occasions (658 and 666) by the Tang Dynasty (618–907) Chinese Buddhist monks Zhi Yu and Zhi You. The wheeled vehicle <b>device</b> <b>was</b> described in intricate detail in the historical text covering the Song Dynasty (960–1279), i.e. the Song Shi (compiled 1345); for example, it revealed the number of gear teeth on each mechanical gear wheel, the diameter of each gear wheel, and how these gear wheels were properly positioned.|$|E
5|$|When a USB <b>device</b> <b>is</b> first {{connected}} to a USB host, the USB <b>device</b> enumeration process <b>is</b> started. The enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to the USB device. The data rate of the USB <b>device</b> <b>is</b> determined during the reset signaling. After reset, the USB <b>device's</b> information <b>is</b> read by the host and the <b>device</b> <b>is</b> assigned a unique 7-bit address. If the <b>device</b> <b>is</b> supported by the host, the device drivers needed for communicating with the <b>device</b> <b>are</b> loaded and the <b>device</b> <b>is</b> set to a configured state. If the USB host is restarted, the enumeration process is repeated for all connected devices.|$|R

5|$|Between 1945 and 1952, optical {{engineers}} {{built upon}} the earlier work of Rudolph Schindler (1888–1968), developing the first gastrocamera.

Initially used in upper GI endoscopy, this <b>device</b> <b>was</b> first used for laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation by Peter Murphy, an English anesthetist, in 1967. The concept of using a stylet for replacing or exchanging orotracheal tubes was introduced by Finucane and Kupshik in 1978, using a central venous catheter.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a {{game that}} used a {{graphical}} display, the cathode-ray tube amusement device is generally not considered under most definitions to {{be a candidate for}} the first video game, as it used purely analog hardware and did not run on a computing device; some loose definitions may still consider it a video game, but it is still usually disqualified as the <b>device</b> <b>was</b> never manufactured. Nevertheless, it is the earliest known interactive electronic game as well as the first to incorporate an electronic display, thus making it a forerunner to other games in the early history of video games. As the <b>device</b> <b>was</b> never manufactured or widely shown, however, it did not directly inspire any other games and had no impact on the future video game industry.|$|E

5|$|The {{cathode-ray}} tube amusement <b>device</b> <b>was</b> {{invented by}} physicists Thomas T. Goldsmith, Jr. and Estle Ray Mann. The pair worked at television designer DuMont Laboratories {{specializing in the}} development of cathode ray tubes that used electronic signal outputs to project a signal onto television screens. Goldsmith, who had received a Ph.D. in physics from Cornell University in 1936 with a focus on oscilloscope design, was {{at the time of the}} device's invention the director of research for DuMont Laboratories in New Jersey. The two inventors were inspired by the radar displays used in World War II, which Goldsmith had worked on during the war. The patent for the <b>device</b> <b>was</b> filed on January 25, 1947 and issued on December 14, 1948. The patent, the first for an electronic game, was never used by either the inventors or DuMont Laboratories, and the <b>device</b> <b>was</b> never manufactured beyond original handmade prototype. Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers historian Alex Magoun has speculated that Goldsmith did not make the prototype with the intent for it to be the basis of any future production, but only designed the device as a demonstration of the kind of commercial opportunities DuMont could pursue. Goldsmith did not work on games after the invention of the device; he was promoted to vice president in 1953 and left DuMont—by then split up and sold to other firms—to become a professor of physics at Furman University in 1966. Goldsmith kept the device and brought it with him to Furman; in a 2016 interview fellow physics professor Bill Brantley recalled Goldsmith demonstrating the game to him.|$|E
