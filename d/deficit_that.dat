They then mounted a series of comebacks in the ALDS, first overcoming a 2-game series deficit to force a deciding Game 5, then tying Game 5 in the 8th inning to force extra innings, and finally a one-run 11th inning <b>deficit</b> <b>that</b> was overcome by the Double.|$|E
5|$|Pennington {{assigned}} Sherman {{to serve}} {{as chairman of the}} Committee on Ways and Means, where he spent much of his time on appropriations bills, while cooperating with his colleague Justin Smith Morrill on the passage of {{what became known as the}} Morrill Tariff. The Morrill Tariff raised duties on imports to close the <b>deficit</b> <b>that</b> had resulted from falling revenues. It also had the effect of encouraging domestic industries, which appealed to the former Whigs in the Republican party. Sherman spoke in favor of the bill, and it passed the House by a vote of 105 to 64. The tariff bill would likely have died in the Senate, but the withdrawal of Southern members at the start of the Civil War allowed the rump Senate to pass the bill in the 36th Congress's final session, and President Buchanan signed it into law in February 1861. Likewise, Sherman supported a bill admitting Kansas as a free state that passed in 1861.|$|E
5|$|The state {{suffered}} from financial difficulties {{during its first}} three decades. Jonathan Jennings attempted to begin a period of internal improvements. Among his projects, the Indiana Canal Company was reestablished to build a canal around the Falls of the Ohio. The Panic of 1819 caused the state's only two banks to fold. This hurt Indiana's credit, halted the projects, and hampered the start of new projects until the 1830s, after the repair of the state's finances during the terms of William Hendricks and Noah Noble. Beginning in 1831, large scale plans for statewide improvements were set into motion. Overspending on the internal improvements led to a large <b>deficit</b> <b>that</b> had to be funded by state bonds through the newly created Bank of Indiana and sale of over nine million acres (36,000km²) of public land. By 1841 the debt had become unmanageable. Having borrowed over $13million, the equivalent to the state's first fifteen years of tax revenue, the government could not even pay interest on the debt. The state narrowly avoided bankruptcy by negotiating the liquidation of the public works, transferring them to the state's creditors {{in exchange for a}} 50% reduction in the state's debt. The internal improvements began under Jennings paid off as the state began to experience rapid population growth that slowly remedied the state's funding problems. The improvements led to a fourfold increase in land value, and an even larger increase in farm produce.|$|E

25|$|The {{first two}} {{quarters}} of Super Bowl XXXIV were largely a defensive battle. Despite outgaining the Titans in total offensive {{yards in the}} first half, 294–89, the Rams held only a 9–0 halftime lead on three field goals. St. Louis later scored their first touchdown midway through the 3rd quarter to go up 16–0. Tennessee then responded by scoring 16 consecutive points {{to tie the game}} with 2:12 left in regulation. This was the largest deficit to be erased in a Super Bowl and the first <b>deficit</b> <b>that</b> was greater than 10 points. On the Rams' ensuing drive, quarterback Kurt Warner completed a 73-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Isaac Bruce to regain the lead. The Titans then drove to the St. Louis 10-yard line with six seconds remaining, but on the final play of the game, Rams linebacker Mike Jones tackled Tennessee wide receiver Kevin Dyson one yard short of the goal line to prevent a potential game-tying touchdown. This play went into NFL lore as One Yard Short, or simply The Tackle. Warner was then named Super Bowl MVP, becoming the sixth player to win both that award and the NFL MVP during the same season. At the time, his 414 passing yards and 45 pass attempts without an interception broke Super Bowl records.|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. Our research {{is concerned with}} the underlying causes of reading difficulty. There is good evidence that some cases of reading difficulty (termed dyslexia) are caused by biologically based cognitive deficits. However, research into the causes of dyslexia is impeded by two main complications. Firstly, there are many possible cognitive <b>deficits</b> <b>that</b> could result in the same profile of reading difficulties. For example, a deficit in processing visual information, auditory information or speech sounds could each result in difficulties in translating written text into speech sounds, and therefore reading problems. Secondly, it is also possible to develop reading difficulties {{in the absence of a}} basic cognitive deficit, for example through inadequate instruction. We will use a comprehensive approach to measure the relative influences of different cognitive deficits, and a successful reading intervention to distinguish between experiential and cognitive causes of reading difficulties. Specifically, we aim to uncover the cognitive <b>deficits</b> <b>that</b> are associated with a reading difficulty that exists even under improved teaching. This research will help to uncover the cognitive <b>deficits</b> <b>that</b> cause dyslexia and will indicate which cognitive tests can most accurately identify pre-readers at risk of developing dyslexia...|$|R
25|$|Hearing loss {{among the}} aged {{community}} lessens elders' ability {{to compensate for}} other age related social and/or physical problems. Communication problems of elderly adults can be greatly impacted by mechanical problems such as: the translation of ideas into linguistic representation or expression, the perception of linguistic stimuli or the derivation of an idea from a given unit of disclosure. Changes in these mechanical problems {{are more important than}} changes in linguistic knowledge. The main goal of hearing aids is to improve communication and quality of life, not just to restore hearing. Presbycusis {{is an example of a}} hearing <b>deficit</b> <b>that</b> cannot be corrected by hearing aids. Presbycusis, the alteration of hearing sensitivity associated with normal hearing loss, is caused by the decreased amount of hair cells of the inner ear. This is normally caused by long periods of distressing noise that diminish the hair cells which with increasing age will not grow back. Presbycusis and other such hearing-related problems promote social withdrawal, as individuals begin to lose touch with the world around them. Hearing loss among the aged community lessens elders' ability to compensate for other age-related social and/or physical problems. This impairment can cause elders to lose touch of social skills because they may have trouble keeping up with fast-paced or hearing different pitched voices in conversation.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{recognizing}} how {{crony capitalism}} weakened the economy due to collusion {{between government and}} big business and adhering to the Catholic social principle of subsidiarity, President Aquino {{set out on a}} course of market liberalization agenda {{while at the same time}} emphasizing solidarity, people empowerment and civic engagement to help alleviate poverty in the country. The Aquino administration also sought to bring back fiscal discipline in order as it aimed to trim down the government's budget <b>deficit</b> <b>that</b> ballooned during Marcos' term through privatization of bad government assets and deregulation of many vital industries. As president, Aquino sought out to dismantle the cartels, monopolies and oligopolies of important industries that were set up by Marcos cronies during the dark days of Martial Law, particularly in the sugar and coconut industries. By discarding these monopolies and allowing market-led prices and competition, small farmers and producers were given a fair chance to sell their produce and products at a more reasonable, competitive and profitable price. This, in a way, also helped a lot in improving the lot of farmers who are in dire need of increasing their personal income and earnings. It was also during Aquino's time that vital economic laws such as the Built-Operate-Transfer Law, Foreign Investments Act and the Consumer Protection and Welfare Act were enacted.|$|E
500|$|Daley {{came into}} office {{in a city with}} revenue-generating assets, {{manageable}} debt and flush pension funds, but he left behind a city with a structural <b>deficit</b> <b>that</b> Mayor-elect Rahm Emanuel estimated at $1.2 billion when under-funded pension funds were included. The Daley administration's expenditures exceeded revenues by {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} a year. In August 2010, Fitch Ratings downgraded the city's bond credit rating, citing the administration's use of reserve funds for general operating expenses and under-funding of its pension funds, and noted that the city faced rising fixed operating costs yet lacked plans for new revenue. Wall Street analysts noted that the Daley administration began drawing on the city's reserves as early as 2006, before the 2008–2012 global recession. [...] "While there had been sound economic growth in years prior to 2008, there were still sizable fund balance drawdowns in both 2006 and 2007," [...] Fitch wrote. The city's budgets continued to increase even after the recession began, to more than $6 billion a year, and, when under-funded city employee pension funds were included, the city's annual deficit exceeded $1 billion. In January 2011, Moody's Investors Service downgraded to a [...] "negative" [...] outlook some of the revenue bonds issued for the $15 billion O'Hare Modernization Program and related infrastructure projects, citing the city's plan to postpone repayment of interest and principal on some construction bonds.|$|E
