As the Predators retreat into space, a chestburster with a hybrid form of an Alien and a Predator erupts from Scar's chest.|$|E
5|$|Light {{falls on}} the {{pictorial}} space from the left, creating shadows against the back wall, the strongest cast by the girl's hennin. The depth of space provided by the back wall gives room for this detailing, which Charles Sterling believes is indebted to van Eyck. The light throws a murky but curved shadow {{on the wall behind}} the girl and acts as a counterpoint to the contour of <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> and hairline.|$|E
60|$|The {{door was}} again opened, and Greta flew in, <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> flushed, <b>her</b> hair {{floating}} behind her, and {{tears streaming down}} <b>her</b> <b>cheeks.</b>|$|R

5|$|During {{a routine}} liposuction {{operation}} in Winnetka, Illinois, Dr. Harrison Lloyd (John Juliani) suddenly begins to remove so much fat {{from a patient}} that the patient dies. Following the unusual experience, Lloyd tells Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) that he killed the patient because he was possessed. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is skeptical about Lloyd's claims, believing he's only making it up to escape legal consequences. Mulder inspects the operation room and discovers a pentagram burned into the floor; he begins to suspect that witchcraft might have {{played a part in}} the crime. Meanwhile, the staff at Lloyd's clinic are shocked when another plastic surgeon, Dr. Ilaqua (Paul Raskin), murders an elderly patient by burning a hole through <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> and neck with a surgical laser, severing her brain stem. Scully interviews Ilaqua, who claims that he cannot remember anything of the incident. Mulder's suspicions are strengthened when he reviews the tape of the second murder, and he sees a pentagram-like pattern on the stomach of the victim.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} chronicles two {{alternative}} time frames, {{with the first}} of Carey in the present, tearful and remorseful their separation, while the other of several different past memories in which she shared with her lover. The video begins with Carey wearing a long brown blouse, laying on a sofa in an elegantly furnished home. As the song begins, she stands up and walks around the living room, while remembering and lamenting her failed relationship. As the first memory of Carey and her lover together on a soccer field is shown, she is once again shown in the present, however clothed in a large white sweater while tears trickle down <b>her</b> <b>cheek.</b> As the memory continues of that night on the soccer field, they are seen together, caressing each other and holding {{each other in a}} tight embrace. Carey, in the present, makes her way into a heated pool, where she lays her leg on the deck, re-enacting a famed scene from Marilyn Monroe's unreleased film, Something's Got to Give (1962). The next memory is of the pair together in the same pool, however in happier times. During the song's bridge, the scenes alternate from Carey at her home in the present, to the duo holding each other intimately in a car. The video ends with Carey alone in the car, while wearing her lover's jacket.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not long}} before the scantily-clad Sabrina {{attracted}} the attention of the then all-male Amherst students. Around 1860, an industrious Amherst student, in the first of many Sabrina-inspired pranks, stole a set of undergarments from one of the nearby female colleges and used them to clothe Sabrina. The college administration harshly reprimanded the student. The next morning, Sabrina appeared with a dent in <b>her</b> <b>cheek,</b> apparently inflicted by a blow from an axe.|$|E
25|$|In June 1984, TV3 began {{broadcasting}} in the Klang Valley. Patrick, alongside Mahadzir Lokman, Wan Zaleha Radzi, Robert Lam, and Caryn Lim {{were hired}} to be newscasters for the station. On Caryn Lim's last {{day on the}} job, Patrick was her co-newscaster. Patrick mentioned that Caryn was leaving the station, then stood up {{and gave her a}} friendly farewell kiss on <b>her</b> <b>cheek.</b> Controversy ensued as the press (mostly the Chinese press) created a ruckus over the kiss aired on television.|$|E
25|$|The 1900 {{portrait}} depicts Williams {{from the}} left side. She is wearing a black dress with red stripes, a pair of red ribbon bowties, and a red ribbon around her neck. Williams's hair is worn down, set against a dark brown background. <b>Her</b> <b>cheek</b> is slightly sunken. Her expression is much softer, virtually inscrutable. The portrait was originally painted on a 24 x 20inch canvas. Eakins cut two inches off the right side, and tacked it to a new stretcher. This {{had the effect of}} re-centering the work on Williams's face.|$|E
60|$|She {{wrenched}} {{her hands}} away from his. There was a bright, red spot of colour flaring on <b>her</b> <b>cheeks.</b> <b>Her</b> {{eyes were on}} fire.|$|R
60|$|Philippa {{stood between}} {{her brother and}} the telephone. There was a queer, angry patch of colour in <b>her</b> <b>cheeks.</b> <b>Her</b> eyes were on fire.|$|R

25|$|Mary is {{described}} by scholars as an Eleusa icon because of the tender {{manner in which the}} child is nestled against <b>her</b> <b>cheek,</b> setting the image as an intimate portrayal of the bond between mother and child. Her head is tilted towards her son and embraces his forehead and cheek almost as if in a kiss, while her arms warmly cradle him. He has one leg bent and another extended towards her, while his right arm is held upright and intimately holds her chin from below. This closeness and engagement of mother and child is a departure from Byzantine tradition, where they were often shown almost at arms length, and was in tune with the ideals of the Italian Quattrocento.|$|E
25|$|When the 1918 Spanish flu {{pandemic}} reached Toronto, Earhart {{was engaged in}} arduous nursing duties that included night shifts at the Spadina Military Hospital. She became a patient herself, suffering from pneumonia and maxillary sinusitis. She was hospitalized in early November 1918, owing to pneumonia, and discharged in December 1918, about {{two months after the}} illness had started. Her sinus-related symptoms were pain and pressure around one eye and copious mucus drainage via the nostrils and throat. While staying in the hospital during the pre-antibiotic era, she had painful minor operations to wash out the affected maxillary sinus, but these procedures were not successful and Earhart subsequently suffered from worsening headaches. Her convalescence lasted nearly a year, which she spent at her sister's home in Northampton, Massachusetts. She passed the time by reading poetry, learning to play the banjo and studying mechanics. Chronic sinusitis significantly affected Earhart's flying and activities in later life, and sometimes even on the airfield she was forced to wear a bandage on <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> to cover a small drainage tube.|$|E
25|$|After Madotsuki {{falls to}} sleep, {{she begins to}} dream. The player is then {{presented}} with a dream world which resembles the same room Madotsuki lives in. In the dream world, the player is able to leave the room, which {{will lead to a}} nexus of 12 doors, with each leading to a different world, including a colorful neon maze, a forest, a world littered with numerical symbols, and a world full of body parts, among others. These 12 worlds, in turn, connect to a number of other worlds, forming a large and expansive area for the player to explore. The purpose of the game is for the player to navigate the main character's dream worlds to obtain 24 objects, known as effects. The player can attempt to interact with objects, although few will provide any response. The player can choose to wake from the dream world at any time, by causing Madotsuki to pinch <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> and awaken. This behavior ensures that the player has {{a way out of the}} dream world at all times.|$|E
60|$|The {{blood had}} rushed to <b>her</b> <b>cheeks,</b> and then flowed {{back to her}} heart, leaving her pale as a lily.

25|$|Lozada and {{her partner}} split up while chasing the suspect. She chased him to a nearby {{abandoned}} lot located {{at the intersection of}} Central Avenue and Chauncey Street and waited at the lot which was heavily weeded and was loaded with junk. When confronted by the suspect she pretended to be looking for a lost dog with the intention that the suspect would not suspect her real motives. The suspect then turned around to look for the dog and Lozada pulled out her service gun. As Lozada attempted to handcuff the suspect, he turned and took her gun. According to Jeter, Lozada pleaded for her life to no avail. The suspect then shot her twice in the face. The first time Jeter fired, the bullet passed through <b>her</b> <b>cheek.</b> He then walked a short distance only to return after a few moments to shoot her in the face, killing her. Lozada's body was found three hours later in the lot; she was the first female officer to be killed {{in the line of duty}} in New York City.|$|E
500|$|Constance Lytton, a {{prominent}} suffragette, used {{a stint in}} Holloway Prison during March 1909 to mutilate her body. Her plan was to carve 'Votes for Women' from her breast to <b>her</b> <b>cheek,</b> {{so that it would}} always be visible. But after completing the [...] "V" [...] on her breast and ribs she requested sterile dressings to avoid blood poisoning, and her plan was aborted by the authorities. She wrote of this in her memoir Prisons and Prisoners.|$|E
500|$|This dear {{child will}} not live; I am perpetually fearing it, {{notwithstanding}} the clear health which crimsons <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> and glitters in her eyes. Such early expansion {{of intelligence and}} sensibility partakes {{too much of the}} angelic, too little of the mortal nature, to tarry long in these low abodes of frailty and of pain, where the harshness of authority, and the impenetrability of selfishness, with the worse mischiefs of pride and envy, so frequently agitate by their storms, and chill by their damps, the more ingenious and purer spirits, scattered, not profusely, over the earth.|$|E
