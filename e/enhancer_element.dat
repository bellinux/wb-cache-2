2500|$|Splicing is {{regulated}} by trans-acting proteins (repressors and activators) and corresponding cis-acting regulatory sites (silencers and enhancers) on the pre-mRNA. However, {{as part of}} the complexity of alternative splicing, it is noted that the effects of a splicing factor are frequently position-dependent. That is, a splicing factor that serves as a splicing activator when bound to an intronic <b>enhancer</b> <b>element</b> may serve as a repressor when bound to its splicing element {{in the context of an}} exon, and vice versa. The secondary structure of the pre-mRNA transcript also plays a role in regulating splicing, such as by bringing together splicing elements or by masking a sequence that would otherwise serve as a binding element for a splicing factor. Together, these elements form a [...] "splicing code" [...] that governs how splicing will occur under different cellular conditions.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{experiments to}} compare the activities of two Drosophila homeodomain proteins, Bicoid (Bcd) and an altered-specificity mutant of Fushi tarazu, Ftz(Q 50 K). Although the homeodomains of these proteins share a virtually indistinguishable ability to recognize a consensus Bcd site, only Bcd can activate transcription from natural <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements</b> when assayed in both yeast and Drosophila Schneider S 2 cells. Our analysis of chimeric proteins suggests that both the homeodomain of Bcd and sequences outside the homeodomain contribute to its ability to recognize natural <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements.</b> We further show that, unlike the Bcd homeodomain, the Ftz(Q 50 K) homeodomain fails to recognize nonconsensus sites found in natural <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements.</b> The defect of a chimeric protein containing the homeodomain of Ftz(Q 50 K) in place of that of Bcd can be preferentially restored by converting the nonconsensus sites in natural <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements</b> to consensus sites. Our experiments suggest that the biological specificity of Bcd is determined by combinatorial contributions of two important mechanisms: the nonconsensus site recognition function conferred by the homeodomain and the cooperativity function conferred primarily by sequences outside the homeodomain. A systematic comparison of different assay methods and <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements</b> further suggests a fluid nature of the requirements for these two Bcd functions in target selection...|$|R

40|$|SummaryElucidating {{the genetic}} control of {{cerebral}} cortical (pallial) development {{is essential for}} understanding function, evolution, and disorders of the brain. Transcription factors (TFs) that embryonically regulate pallial regionalization are expressed in gradients, raising {{the question of how}} discrete domains are generated. We provide evidence that small <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements</b> active in protodomains integrate broad transcriptional information. CreERT 2 and GFP expression from 14 different <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements</b> in stable transgenic mice allowed us to define a comprehensive regional fate map of the pallium. We explored transcriptional mechanisms that control the activity of the enhancers using informatics, in vivo occupancy by TFs that regulate cortical patterning (CoupTFI, Pax 6, and Pbx 1), and analysis of enhancer activity in Pax 6 mutants. Overall, the results provide insights into how broadly expressed patterning TFs regulate the activity of small <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements</b> that drive gene expression in pallial protodomains that fate map to distinct cortical regions...|$|R

Recently, evidence has been accumulated that HCV viral proteins might interfere with gene expression of host cells. Here, we demonstrate that the amino-terminal portion of HCV NS 2 protein inhibits the expression of reporter genes driven by different promoters or <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements</b> and also inhibits hepatitis B virus (HBV) gene expression and HBV DNA replication. The inhibitory effect of HCV NS 2 on liver and non-liver-specific promoters and <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements</b> might be relevant for the pathogenesis of chronic HCV infection...|$|R

However, differences in the integration site preferences were detected, which might be explained by differences in viral components of the preintegration complexes. Viral determinants of integration site preferences have not been defined. Therefore, integration sites of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) -based vectors produced {{in the absence of}} accessory genes or lacking promoter and <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements</b> were compared. Similar integration patterns for the different SIV vectors indicate that vif, vpr, vpx, nef, env, and promoter or <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements</b> are not required for preferential integration of SIV into transcriptionally active regions of genomes...|$|R
50|$|Tonegawa’s Nobel Prize work elucidated {{the genetic}} {{mechanism}} of the adaptive immune system, which had been the central question of immunology for over 100 years. Prior to Tonegawa’s discovery, one early idea to explain the adaptive immune system suggested that each gene produces one protein; however, there are under 19,000 genes {{in the human body}} which nonetheless can produce millions of antibodies. In experiments beginning in 1976, Tonegawa showed that genetic material rearranges itself to form millions of antibodies. Comparing the DNA of B cells (a type of white blood cell) in embryonic and adult mice, he observed that genes in the mature B cells of the adult mice are moved around, recombined, and deleted to form the diversity of the variable region of antibodies. In 1983, Tonegawa also discovered a transcriptional <b>enhancer</b> <b>element</b> associated with antibody gene complex, the first cellular <b>enhancer</b> <b>element.</b>|$|E

40|$|The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immediate-early gene product, BRLF 1, transactivates {{the human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) long terminal repeat. BRLF 1 -induced transactivation of HIV- 1 promoter constructs is accompanied {{by an increase in}} plasmid mRNA and is reporter gene independent. Previously, BRLF 1 transactivation of EBV promoters has been mapped to regions which function as <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements.</b> Deletional analysis demonstrates that BRLF 1 transactivation of the HIV- 1 promoter does not require the HIV- 1 enhancer. Thus, the EBV BRLF 1 gene product may transactivate by at least two different mechanisms, one mechanism involving certain <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements</b> and another mechanism which is enhancer independent...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} {{duplication}} {{of any one}} of three separate simian virus 40 <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements,</b> A, B, or C, can compensate for loss of function in the remaining two. Simian virus 40 revertants containing point mutations within the A and C (dpm 16) or B and C (dpm 26) <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements</b> contain tandem duplications that include the remaining wild-type element. These simple tandem duplications can create enhancers 25 -fold more active {{than that of the}} parental mutant. These revertants can arise by illegitimate recombination between heterologous viral genomes.

50|$|Liebenberg Syndrome is {{a result}} of one of two {{different}} genetic mutations. The first is a deletion upstream of the PITX1 gene on chromosome 5. This deletion includes the H2AFY gene, which is responsible for suppressing an upstream <b>enhancer</b> <b>element</b> known as hs1473. When H2AFY is removed, the enhancer is brought closer to PITX1 and inappropriately enhances it in forelimbs, causing them to adopt hindlimb morphology.|$|E

They suggested that proteins made by specific tissues acted on these enhancers to activate sets of genes during cell differentiation.|$|E
40|$|Cdx 2 is a caudal-related {{homeodomain}} {{transcription factor}} that {{is expressed in}} complex patterns during mouse development and at high levels in the intestinal epithelium of adult mice. Cdx 2 activates transcription of intestinal gene promoters containing specific binding sites. Moreover, Cdx 2 {{has been shown to}} induce intestinal differentiation in cell lines. In this study, we show that Cdx 2 is able to bind to two well defined <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements</b> in the HoxC 8 gene. We then demonstrate that Cdx 2 is able to activate transcription of heterologous promoters when its DNA binding element is placed in an enhancer context. Furthermore, the ability to activate <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements</b> is cell-line dependent. When the Cdx 2 activation domain was linked to the Gal 4 DNA binding domain, the chimeric protein was able to activate Gal 4 enhancer constructs in an intestinal cell line, but was unable to activate transcription in NIH 3 T 3 cells. These data suggest that there are cell-specific factors that allow the Cdx 2 activation domain to function in the activation of <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements.</b> We hypothesize that either a co-activator protein or differential phosphorylation of the activation domain may be the mechanism for intestinal cell line-specific function of Cdx 2 and possibly in other tissues in early development...|$|R

The <b>enhancer</b> <b>element</b> of the immunoglobulin heavy locus, which normally functions to make B cells produce massive production of antibodies, now induces massive transcription of the fusion protein, resulting in excessive pro-proliferative or anti-apoptotic effects on the B cells containing the fusion protein.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSystemic vasculitides {{are poorly}} {{understood}} inflammatory {{diseases of the}} blood vessels that are frequently associated with significant organ damage. Genetic risk variants contribute to the susceptibility of vasculitis, but functional consequences of these genetic variants are largely unknown. Most genetic risk variants in immune-mediated diseases, including systemic vasculitis, are localized to non-coding genetic regions suggesting they might increase disease risk by influencing regulatory elements within the genome. Long range regulatory interactions pose an additional obstacle in localizing functional consequences associated with risk variants to specific genes or cell types. We used cell-type specific enrichment patterns of histone changes that mark poised, primed, and active enhancers, and DNase hypersensitivity to identify specific immune cells mediating genetic risk in vasculitis. Our data suggest that genetic risk variants in ANCA-associated vasculitis are significantly enriched in <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements</b> in Th 17 cells, supporting a role for Th 17 cells in this disease. Primed and active <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements</b> in B cells can be potentially affected by genetic risk variants associated with Kawasaki disease. Genetic risk in Behçet's disease and Takayasu arteritis might affect <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements</b> in multiple cell types, possibly explained by influencing enhancers in hematopoietic stem cells. Interestingly, our analyses indicate a role for B cells in Kawasaki disease, Behçet's disease, and Takayasu arteritis, and suggest that further work to characterize the involvement of B cells in these diseases is warranted...|$|R
40|$|Epigenetic {{regulation}} of gene <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements</b> {{is important for}} establishing and maintaining the identity of cells. Gene <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements</b> are thought to exist in either active or poised states distinguishable by chromatin features, but a complete understanding of the {{regulation of}} enhancers is lacking. Here, by using mouse embryonic stem cells and their differentiated derivatives, as well as terminally differentiated cells, we report the coexistence of multiple, defined classes of enhancers that serve distinct cellular functions. Specifically, we found that active enhancers can be subclassified based on varying levels of H 3 K 4 me 1, H 3 K 27 ac, and H 3 K 36 me 3 and the pSer 2 / 5 forms of RNA polymerase II. The abundance of these histone modifications positively correlates with the expression of associated genes and cellular functions consistent with {{the identity of the}} cell type. Poised enhancers can also be subclassified based on presence or absence of H 3 K 27 me 3 and H 3 K 9 me 3, conservation, genomic location, expression levels of associated genes, and predicted function of associated genes. These findings not only refine the repertoire of histone modifications at both active and poised gene <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements</b> but also raise the possibility that enhancers associated with distinct cellular functions are partitioned based on specific combinations of histone modifications...|$|R
40|$|Developmental {{programs}} {{are controlled by}} transcription factors and chromatin regulators, which maintain specific gene expression programs through epigenetic modification of the genome. These regulatory events at enhancers contribute to the specific gene expression programs that determine cell state {{and the potential for}} differentiation into new cell types. Although <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements</b> are known to be associated with certain histone modifications and transcription factors, the relationship of these modifications to gene expression and developmental state has not been clearly defined. Here we interrogate the epigenetic landscape of <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements</b> in embryonic stem cells and several adult tissues in the mouse. We find that histone H 3 K 27 ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements</b> containing H 3 K 4 me 1 alone. This indicates that the amount of actively used enhancers is lower than previously anticipated. Furthermore, poised enhancer networks provide clues to unrealized developmental programs.

One possibly explanation for this is that the secondary structure may protect the RNA from 5'-3' exonuclease activity. In RNA1 both structural elements within the 3' and 5' UTR are required to translation to occur as the 3'UTR contains the translation <b>enhancer</b> <b>element</b> and the 5'UTR contains structures that aid in recruiting translation factors but also act to increase RNA stability.|$|E

40|$|Transcriptional {{repression}} {{within a}} complex modular promoter {{may play a}} key role in determining the action of <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements.</b> In human cytomegalovirus, the major immediate-early promoter (MIEP) locus contains a highly potent and complex modular enhancer. Evidence is presented suggesting that sequences of the MIEP between nucleotide positions − 556 and − 673 function to prevent transcription activation by <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements</b> from the UL 127 open reading frame divergent promoter. Transient transfection assays of reporter plasmids revealed repressor sequences located between nucleotides − 556 and − 638. The ability of these sequences to confer repression in the context of an infection was shown using recombinant viruses generated from a bacterial artificial chromosome containing an infectious human cytomegalovirus genome. In addition to repressor sequences between − 556 and − 638, infection experiments using recombinant virus mutants indicated that sequences between − 638 and − 673 also contribute to repression of the UL 127 promoter. On the basis of in vitro transcription and transient transfection assays, we further show that interposed viral repressor sequences completely inhibit enhancer-mediated activation of not only the homologous but also heterologous promoters. These and other experiments suggest that repression involves an interaction of host-encoded regulatory factors with defined promoter sequences that have the property of proximally interfering with upstream <b>enhancer</b> <b>elements</b> in a chromatin-independent manner. Altogether, our findings establish the presence of a boundary domain that efficiently blocks enhancer-promoter interactions, thus explaining how the enhancer can work to selectively activate the MIEP...|$|R
