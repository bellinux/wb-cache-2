30|$|With {{the results}} {{obtained}} from this research, we attained our general objective to advance the understanding of how software startups and their ecosystems function. We presented a conceptual framework that depicts software startup ecosystems, their agents, and the relationships among them, accomplishing the <b>specific</b> <b>objective</b> 1. We iteratively evolved this framework until reaching a final version that fitted well in all three analyzed ecosystems (<b>specific</b> <b>objective</b> 2). We created a maturity model to map ecosystem evolution, achieving the <b>specific</b> <b>objective</b> 4. Stakeholders from any existing ecosystem can use the proposed model to evaluate its maturity and also compare to others (<b>specific</b> <b>objective</b> 4).|$|R

It identifies a certain number of <b>Specific</b> <b>Objectives</b> of the programming period 2014 to 2020, which have a strong linkage to the field of culture and to the cultural projects. Criteria are defined in order to stratify the database of <b>Specific</b> <b>Objectives.</b> These criteria lead to the creation of a matrix that helps in grasping the data in a practical manner. In the conclusion a method for designing an application which works with the data is specified as is the user-interface of the said application. Finally, an appropriate positioning of the application on the internet is proposed {{so that it can be}} accessible to potential users. The thesis thus proves the fact that cultural projects have many opportunities to contribute to the programming period 2014 to 2020...|$|R
