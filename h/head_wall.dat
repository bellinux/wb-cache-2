500|$|The <b>Head</b> <b>Wall</b> {{was built}} in 1834 when the medieval village was {{abandoned}} and a new one planned between Tobar Childa and the sea some 700feet (200 m) down the slope.

Appalled by the primitive conditions, he gave money for the building of a completely new settlement of thirty new blackhouses. These houses were made of dry stone, had thick walls, and were roofed with turf. Each typically had only one tiny window and a small opening for letting out smoke from the peat fire that burnt in the middle of the room. As a result, the interiors were blackened by soot. The cattle occupied one end of the house in winter, and once a year the straw from the floor was stripped out and spread on the ground. [...] In October 1860, several of the new dwellings were damaged by a severe gale, and repairs were sufficient only to make them suitable for use as byres. According to Alasdair MacGregor's analysis of the settlement, the sixteen modern, zinc-roofed cottages amidst the black houses and new Factor's house seen in most photographs of the native islanders were constructed around 1862.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Multi-beam {{echosounder}} {{data and}} grain size analysis data of surface sediment were acquired and analyzed {{in order to}} investigate the shelf-to-slope morphology, geological character, and their geological controlling factors in the southwestern margin of the Ulleung Basin. According to the morphological character, the continental shelf {{can be divided into}} two parts: (1) shallow (~ 100 m) and steep (0. 5 o) inner shelf, (2) deep (100 - 300 m) and gentle (0. 2 o) outer shelf. The continental slope is featured with eight distinct topographic depressions of various spatial dimension (~ 121 km 2 in area) and <b>head</b> <b>wall</b> gradient (~ 24. 3 o). They are developed adjacent to each other and presumably formed by submarine landslides which have recurred under the strong influences of earthquakes and eustatic sea-level change. The inner continental shelf and the continental slope are dominated by fine-grained sediment, whereas the outer continental shelf is dominated by coarse-grained sediment. The surface sediment distribution seems dominantly influenced by eustatic sea-level change. The outer continental shelf is mostly covered by coarse relict sediment deposited during lowstand sea-level, whil...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHydraulic model {{tests of}} the intake {{structure}} of Beyhan 1 Dam having four units were carried out at Hydromechanics Laboratory of Middle East Technical University, Ankara. In order to investigate the flow pattern, and formation, development and dissipation of vortices at the intake structure under different operation conditions of the units, and to determine the types of anti-vortex devices to avoid the air-entraining vortices, a model of 1 / 29. 43 length scale was constructed. The model area covers an about 200 m × 300 m section of the Beyhan 1 reservoir, the intake structure having four units, the trash racks and penstocks. Experiments were carried out at various reservoir water levels with specified unit operation discharges for various unit operation conditions. From the observations and experimental results, {{it was concluded that}} air-entraining vortices were forming at the intakes when the reservoir water level was minimum, RWL= 977. 0 m. Flow separation zones were forming; along the inner lengths of the side walls surrounding the intake structure and behind the trashrack piers at any RWL tested.

40|$|Since the Three Mile Island accident, an {{important}} focus of {{pressurized water reactor}} (PWR) transient analyses has been a small-break loss-of-coolant accident (SBLOCA). In 2002, the discovery of thinning of the vessel <b>head</b> <b>wall</b> at the Davis Besse nuclear power plant reactor indicated {{the possibility of an}} SBLOCA in the upper head of the reactor vessel as a result of circumferential cracking of a control rod drive mechanism penetration nozzle - which has cast even greater importance on the study of SBLOCAs. Several experimental tests have been performed at the Large Scale Test Facility to simulate the behavior of a PWR during an upper-head SBLOCA. The last of these tests, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Nuclear Energy Agency Rig of Safety Assessment (OECD/NEA ROSA) Test 6. 1, was performed in 2005. This test was simulated with the TRACE 5. 0 code, and good agreement with the experimental results was obtained. Additionally, a broad analysis of an upper-head SBLOCA with high-pressure safety injection failed in a Westinghouse PWR was performed taking into account different accident management actions and conditions in order to check their suitability. This issue has been analyzed also in the framework of the OECD/NEA ROSA project and the Code Applications and Maintenance Program (CAMP). The main conclusion is that the current emergency operating procedures for Westinghouse reactor design are adequate for these kinds of sequences, and they {{do not need to be}} modified...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Fukushima {{accident}} {{shows that}} In-Vessel Retention (IVR) of molten core debris {{has not been}} appropriately assessed, and a certain pressure (up to 8. 0 MPa) still exists inside the reactor pressure vessel (RPV). Generally, the pressure is supposed to successfully be released, and the externally cooled lower <b>head</b> <b>wall</b> mainly experiences the temperature difference which {{may be more than}} 1000 °C. Therefore, {{in order to make the}} IVR succeed, it is necessary to investigate the creep behaviour and damage distribution of the RPV under complex thermal-mechanical loadings. Accordingly, considering the unlikely core melt down scenario for a light water reactor (LWR) a possible failure mode of the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) and its failure time has to be predicted for a determination of the loadings on the containment. Due to the thickness of RPV, the high temperature gradient results in various failure modes, i. e., plastic failure and creep failure. In disclosing the failure mechanism, the finite element model has been developed simulating the thermal processes and the visco-plastic behaviours of vessel wall. An advanced model for creep damage has been established to analyze the fracture time and fracture position of a vessel with an internally heated melt pool. Before the above, the stress and strain distributions along the wall thickness are investigated by ABAQUS software. Finally, the result shows that the calculated stress outside the RPV is lower than the yield stress of the material through most thickness. It is concluded that the RPV can maintain its integrity under IVR with given time, even if there exists the internal pressure of 8 MPa...|$|E
