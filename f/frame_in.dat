40|$|AbstractRecently, some {{researchers}} propose {{the concept of}} orthogonal wavelet frames, which are useful for multiple access communication systems. In this article, we first give two explicit algorithms for constructing paraunitary symmetric matrices (p. s. m. for short), whose entries are symmetric or antisymmetric Laurent polynomials. We also give two algorithms for constructing orthogonal wavelet frames from existing tight or dual wavelet <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> L 2 (Rs). The constructed orthogonal wavelet frames are also tight or dual ones. Furthermore, based on the constructed p. s. m. and the existing symmetric tight (dual) wavelet frames, we can obtain symmetric orthogonal (s. o. for short) tight (dual) wavelet <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> L 2 (Rs). From the constructed s. o. wavelet <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> L 2 (Rs), we can obtain s. o. wavelet <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> L 2 (Rm) by the projection method, where m≤s. To illustrate our results, we construct s. o. wavelet <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> L 2 (R) and L 2 (R 2) from the quadratic B-spline B 3 (x). Especially, in Example 2, we obtain nonseparable tight 2 I 2 -wavelet <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> L 2 (R 2) from a separable tight 2 I 2 -wavelet frame constructed by tensor product...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we study}} {{stationary}} and nonstationary nonhomogeneous dual wavelet frames with an arbitrary real dilation {{factor in the}} frequency domain by introducing and investigating a pair of frequency-based nonhomogeneous dual wavelet <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> the distribution space. This notion {{of a pair of}} frequency-based nonhomogeneous dual wavelet <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> the distribution space enables us to completely separate its perfect reconstruction property from its stability property in function spaces. The results in this paper lead to a natural explanation for the oblique extension principle for constructing dual wavelet frames from refinable functions without any a priori condition on the generating wavelet functions and refinable functions. A pair of frequency-based nonhomogeneous dual wavelet <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> the distribution space, that is not necessarily derived from refinable functions via a multiresolution analysis, has a natural multiresolution-like structure, which is closely linked to the fast wavelet frame transform. Moreover, nonhomogeneous dual wavelet <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> the distribution space play a basic role in understanding dual wavelet <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> various function spaces and have a close relation to nonstationary dual wavelet frames, which are of interest in applications. To illustrate the flexibility and generality of the results in this paper, we characterize a pair of fully nonstationary dual wavelet <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> the distribution space. Our results naturally link a nonstationary dual wavelet frame filter bank having the perfect reconstruction property to a pair of nonstationary dual wavelet <b>frames</b> <b>in</b> the distribution space...|$|R
