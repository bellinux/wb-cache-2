As a result improved information is required about timber yields from a range of species on better quality sites for production forecasting, financial appraisal, and planning at the local, regional and strategic levels. This paper describes the development of models that enable <b>General</b> <b>Yield</b> Class (GYC) to be predicted from site factors for Douglas fir, Japanese larch and Scots pine. Temporary sample plots were established in stands below 350 m on Land Capability for Forestry class I to V sites. At each location GYC was assessed, as well as the soil, climate and topographic factors which had been demonstrated to influence forest productivity in earlier studies in Scotland. The models, based on a step-wise multiple regression procedure, indicate that mean spring temperature, geomorphic shelter (topex), and crop age are most important in determining the productivity of Douglas fir and Japanese larch. For Scots pine, mean spring temperature, mean winter temperature, and crop age are the most important factors.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{develops}} a novel nonlinear numerical method to perform shakedown analysis of structures subjected to variable loads {{by means of}} nonlinear programming techniques and the displacement-based finite element method. The analysis {{is based on a}} <b>general</b> <b>yield</b> function which can take the form of most soil yield criteria (e. g. the Mohr–Coulomb or Drucker–Prager criterion). Using an associated flow rule, a <b>general</b> <b>yield</b> criterion can be directly introduced into the kinematic theorem of shakedown analysis without linearization. The plastic dissipation power can then be expressed in terms of the kinematically admissible velocity and a nonlinear formulation is obtained. By means of nonlinear mathematical programming techniques and the finite element method, a numerical model for kinematic shakedown analysis is developed as a nonlinear mathematical programming problem subject to {{only a small number of}} equality constraints. The objective function corresponds to the plastic dissipation power which is to be minimized and an upper bound to the shakedown load can be calculated. An effective, direct iterative algorithm is then proposed to solve the resulting nonlinear programming problem. The calculation is based on the kinematically admissible velocity with one-step calculation of the elastic stress field. Only a small number of equality constraints are introduced and the computational effort is very modest. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed numerical method have been validated by several numerical examples...|$|E
