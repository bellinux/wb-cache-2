My studies showed me the force of what I read, [...] the more I put it from me the more it rushed back with new instances and power... Soon afterwards <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> attention to works of Christian evidence, reading them at first with pleasure, soon with doubt, and at last in some cases with derision." [...] He then continued, [...] "Soon after I had relinquished the kingdom of God I began {{to take up a}} real interest in the kingdom of Ireland. My politics went round... to a temperate Nationalism." ...|$|E
500|$|The second {{investigations}} performed between 1981 and 1984 by the legislature, the U.S. Justice Department, and {{the local}} press uncovered a plot to assassinate the activists and a possible, though not conclusive, conspiracy to cover-up these actions. During interviews of the Senate Investigations Committee in 1983, officer Miguel Cartagena Flores, a detective in the Intelligence Division of the Puerto Rico Police Department, testified: “When I arrived at the scene I saw 4 police officers aiming their guns at the two activists who were kneeling before them. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> eyes away and heard 5 gunshots." [...] Cartagena, who was offered immunity for his testimony, added that several hours before the shooting, he and other officers were told by Col. Angel Perez Casillas, commander of the Intelligence Division, that “these terrorists should not come down (from the mountain) alive.” His testimony was corroborated by officer Carmelo Cruz who, {{although he did not}} witness the fatal shooting, confirmed many details provided by Cartagena when also granted immunity.|$|E

"As I {{read the}} utopian socialists, the {{scientific}} socialists, the German Social Democrats and revolutionary socialists—whatever I could in either English or French—I {{came to the}} conclusion that almost all of them, including my grandfather, were engaged in an effort to change human nature. The more I thought about it, the more I thought this was not likely to be a successful effort. So <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> attention more and more to political philosophy and less and less to socialist activism of any kind." ...|$|E

'Now {{get on my}} back,' he said to Paul, 'and when <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> head to the right, cut a slice off the bullock {{that hangs}} on that side, {{and put it in}} my mouth, and when <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> head to the left, draw a cupful of wine from the cask that hangs on that side, and pour it down my throat.' ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{following}} {{is an example of}} this type of experience: ‘My husband died in June 1945, and 26 years afterwards when I was at Church, I felt him standing beside me during the singing of a hymn. I felt I would see him if <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> head. The feeling was so strong I was reduced to tears. I had not been thinking of him before I felt his presence. I had not had this feeling before that day, neither has it happened since then.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{wanted to}} paint myself into what absorbed me... Natural figures would {{have broken the}} spell of it, so I made my figures half unreal. Some critics have said that <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> figures into puppets, as if my aim were to hint at the hard {{economic}} necessities that drove them. To say the truth, I was not thinking very much about the people. I did not care {{for them in the}} way a social reformer does. They are part of a private beauty that haunted me. I loved them and the houses in the same way: as part of a vision.|$|E
2500|$|... "I want {{to explain}} what happened. Sunday night when you {{requested}} to have someone over I didn't realize you wanted the room in private. I went to Molly's room and I was showing her how I set up my computer so I can access it from anywhere. I turned on my camera and saw you {{in the corner of}} the screen and I immediately closed it. I felt uncomfortable and guilty of what happened. Obviously I told people what occurred so they could give me advice. Then Tuesday when you requested the room again I wanted to make sure what happened Sunday wouldn't happen again and not to video chat me from 930 to 12. Just in case, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> camera away and put my computer to sleep so even if anyone tried it wouldn't work. I wanted to make amends for Sunday night. I'm sorry if you heard something distorted and disturbing but I assure you all my actions were good natured." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{must have}} been late 1941 or early 1942. Jews were {{required}} to wear the Star of David and to obey a 6p.m. curfew. I had gone {{to play with a}} Christian friend and had stayed too late. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> brown sweater inside out to walk the few blocks home. As I was walking down an empty street, I saw a German soldier approaching. He was wearing the black uniform that I had been told to fear more than others – the one worn by specially recruited SS soldiers. As I came closer to him, trying to walk fast, I noticed that he was looking at me intently. Then he beckoned me over, picked me up, and hugged me. I was terrified that he would notice the star inside my sweater. He was speaking to me with great emotion, in German. When he put me down, he opened his wallet, showed me a picture of a boy, and gave me some money. I went home more certain than ever that my mother was right: people were endlessly complicated and interesting. (Kahneman, 2003, p. 417) ...|$|E

6000|$|He stood unnoticed on the dreary platform, {{except by}} {{the rain and}} by the wind. Those two {{vigilant}} assailants made a rush at him. [...] "Very well," [...] said he, yielding. [...] "It signifies nothing to me to what quarter <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> face." ...|$|R
