It is also subbmitting a design solution to functional parts <b>for</b> <b>blanking</b> <b>the</b> “windows” and coining the “locks”. The cage will be made from sheet steel 11 300. 29. This cage should replace the current one machined from the brass Ms 58 Al. According to the literary research and development experiences of the company ZKL Brno, a. s., two pairs of tools were designed. First one <b>for</b> <b>blanking</b> <b>the</b> “windows” {{and second one for}} coining the “locks”. Blanking punch, blanking die and coining punch will be made from the steel 19436, coining die will be made from the steel 19312. Heat-treating process will be accomplished according to the enclosed drawings. Both pairs of tools will be mounted in the press LENR 63 AU (manufactured by the company ŠMERAL Trnava), with nominal force 630 kN...|$|E

40|$|Zirconium oxide (Zirconia) coating {{on carbon}} fabric (C-fabric) was {{developed}} by using zirconia sol. C-fabrics having different weight percentages (wt%) of zirconia namely 0 wt% (Blank), 3. 5 wt%, 6. 5 wt% and 9. 5 wt% were used to make Zirconia–Carbon–Phenolic (Zr–C–Ph) composites. Similarly, 0. 5 wt% multiwalled carbon nanotube (CNT) dispersed phenolic resin was used to make CNT–C–Ph composite. Thermal conductivity, ILSS and flexural strength were measured for the prepared composites. Based on the initial results, subsequently a functionally graded carbon–phenolic composite (FG-C–Ph) having CNT–C–Ph composition up to certain thickness followed by Zr–C–Ph composition for the remaining thickness was made. Thermal insulation and ablative properties <b>for</b> <b>blank</b> C–Ph, Zr–C–Ph, FG-C–Ph were studied using plasma arc jet test which was carried out at a heat flux of 4. 0 MW/m 2 for 30 s.

40|$|Abstract. A {{multi-stage}} {{stamping process}} of one-piece automobile steel wheels from tubes {{was developed to}} decrease the loss of material <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>blanking.</b> In this process, the tube is nosed into a cup with a central hole, and then the taper bottom and side wall of the cup are formed into disk and rim portions of the wheel, respectively. The tube is produced by bending a rectangular sheet into a tube and by welding both edges of the bent sheet to prevent the loss of material <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>blanking.</b> <b>The</b> stamping sequence of the one-piece wheels was designed by finite element simulation. The central hole of the cup was decreased to a desired diameter of the hub hole without buckling and wrinkling by a 5 -stages nosing operation. The taper bottom of the cup was reversely drawn, and then was flared without folding by 2 stages. The wall thickness of the formed wheel was thick and thin in the disk and rim portions, receptively, and thus the requirement of strength of wheels is satisfied. A one-piece wheel having a hub hole was successfully formed by the designed sequence in a miniature experiment...|$|R
