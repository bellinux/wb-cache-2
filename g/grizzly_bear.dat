He washes material with his pan, seeking bits of placer gold. The reverse adapts the Flag of California, known as the Bear Flag, showing a <b>grizzly</b> <b>bear.</b> Mora left the fields, or background, of the coin unpolished, giving the piece a textured look.|$|E

25|$|Once combat {{damage is}} dealt, the now 5/5 <b>Grizzly</b> <b>Bears</b> deal 5 {{damage to the}} Hill Giant and easily kills it. Hill Giant {{attempts}} to deal 3 damage to the <b>Grizzly</b> <b>Bears,</b> but the remainder of Norman's damage prevention shield prevents a further 2 damage (totaling 4 damage) and <b>Grizzly</b> <b>Bears</b> only takes 1 damage.|$|R
25|$|<b>Grizzly</b> <b>bears</b> {{hibernate}} for 5–7 months {{each year}} except where {{the climate is}} warm, as the California grizzly did not hibernate. During this time, female <b>grizzly</b> <b>bears</b> give birth to their offspring, who then consume milk from their mother and gain strength {{for the remainder of}} the hibernation period. To prepare for hibernation, grizzlies must prepare a den, and consume an immense amount of food as they do not eat during hibernation. <b>Grizzly</b> <b>bears</b> do not defecate or urinate throughout the entire hibernation period. The male <b>grizzly</b> <b>bear's</b> hibernation ends in early to mid-March, while females emerge in April or early May.|$|R
25|$|When Tom's turn ends, {{the single}} point of damage {{is removed from}} the <b>Grizzly</b> <b>Bears,</b> and the Giant Growth effect wears off at the same time. As Norman's turn begins, his <b>Grizzly</b> <b>Bears</b> are {{undamaged}} and 2/2.|$|R
5|$|The series {{takes place}} over the span of six books, which are: The Quest Begins, Great Bear Lake, Smoke Mountain, The Last Wilderness, Fire in the Sky, and Spirits in the Stars. The story follows four young bears. Lusa, a black bear, Kallik, a polar bear, Toklo, a <b>grizzly</b> <b>bear</b> and Ujurak, {{who is able to}} shape-shift into any animal, but remains a brown bear most of the time.|$|E
5|$|Glass {{is badly}} mauled by a <b>grizzly</b> <b>bear</b> and left close to death. Trapper John Fitzgerald, fearful of another Arikara attack, {{argues that the}} group must mercy-kill Glass and keep moving. Henry agrees, but is unable to pull the trigger; instead, he offers money for someone to stay with Glass. When the only volunteers are Hawk and the young Jim Bridger, Fitzgerald agrees to stay for money, to recoup his losses from the {{abandoned}} pelts.|$|E
5|$|Grizzly Rage {{breaks the}} {{standard}} mold for many Syfy natural horror films {{in that the}} bear featured is a normal <b>grizzly</b> <b>bear</b> rather than a mutant or genetically altered animal. However, the bear and actors never appear {{together in the same}} frame, rather a man in a bear suit takes over the role when the actors must interact with the bear. Critics heavily panned the film, feeling its plot, script, characters, and special effects were substandard.|$|E
25|$|With the {{reintroduction}} of gray wolves (Canis lupus) to Yellowstone National Park, {{much interest}} {{has been shown}} regarding {{the effects of a}} restored wolf population on both <b>grizzly</b> <b>bears</b> and black <b>bears.</b> <b>Grizzly</b> <b>bears,</b> black bears, and gray wolves have historically coexisted in much of the same range throughout a large portion of North America.|$|R
25|$|Exacerbating this is {{the fact}} that {{intensive}} human use of grizzly habitat coincides with the seasonal movement of <b>grizzly</b> <b>bears</b> e.g. in the fall, when <b>grizzly</b> <b>bears</b> congregate near streams to feed on salmon when anglers are also intensively using the river.|$|R
2500|$|However, Norman {{decides to}} cast his [...] spell to give +3/+3 to his <b>Grizzly</b> <b>Bears</b> before combat damage is dealt. He taps a Forest {{to pay for}} the spell, and puts Giant Growth on the stack. Tom, who does not want to give the <b>Grizzly</b> <b>Bears</b> a chance to grow to 5/5 and kill his Hill Giant, {{responds}} by casting [...] targeting the <b>Grizzly</b> <b>Bears.</b> He taps one Mountain {{to pay for the}} spell, and puts Shock on the stack on top of Giant Growth. If Norman had no other spells, then Tom's Shock would resolve first and deal 2 damage to the <b>Grizzly</b> <b>Bears,</b> killing them. His Giant Growth would then go to the graveyard with no effect because the Bears would no longer be on the battlefield and would thus be an illegal target. Fortunately for Norman, he has another spell to cast. He taps a Plains and casts [...] targeting his <b>Grizzly</b> <b>Bears.</b> Now Mending Hands is on top of the stack, with Shock and then Giant Growth beneath it.|$|R
5|$|The {{state of}} <b>grizzly</b> <b>bear</b> populations in Banff {{is seen as}} a proxy for {{ecological}} integrity. To keep bears away from humans, an electric fence was put up around the summer gondola and parking lot at Lake Louise in 2001. Bear-proof garbage cans, which do not allow bears to access their contents, help to deter them from human sites. The fruit of Buffaloberry bushes is eaten by bears, so the bushes have been removed in some areas where the risk of a bear–human encounter is high.|$|E
5|$|Grizzly Rage is a 2007 Canadian {{television}} horror film {{produced by}} RHI Entertainment that premiered in Canada on the video-on-demand channel Movie Central On Demand on June 7, 2007. It aired in the United States on the Sci Fi Channel on September 16, 2007. Filmed in Winnipeg, Manitoba, {{the film is}} the 2nd title in the Maneater Series produced under an agreement with Syfy. Featuring a cast of four, the film focuses {{on a group of}} teenagers who struggle to survive in a restricted forest while an enraged <b>grizzly</b> <b>bear</b> hunts them relentlessly seeking retribution for killing its cub.|$|E
5|$|Menominees from Green Bay, who had mobilized a {{battalion}} of nearly 300 men, arrived {{too late for the}} battle. They were upset at having missed the chance to fight their old enemies, and so on August 10, General Scott sent 100 of them after a part of the British Band that had escaped. Indian agent Samuel C. Stambaugh, who accompanied them, urged the Menominees not to take any scalps, but Chief <b>Grizzly</b> <b>Bear</b> insisted that such a prohibition could not be enforced. The group tracked down about ten Sauks, only two of whom were warriors. The Menominees killed and scalped the warriors, but spared the women and children.|$|E

5|$|The wolves {{are kept}} in a human {{facility}} {{for a couple of}} months to be examined, and a wound on Oldtooth's paw is treated. In early winter, the wolves are sedated again and awaken to find themselves in a strange high place with radio collars around their necks. Still groggy from the tranquilizer, the strangeness of the events and the smell of <b>grizzly</b> <b>bear</b> in the area triggers Marta's flight instincts and she runs blindly downward, leaving Oldtooth and the cubs behind. When Oldtooth awakens, he quietly abandons Annie and Sula, following Marta's trail, but at a much slower pace.|$|E
5|$|All campsites {{accessible}} only on foot or by horseback are considered backcountry campsites {{and they are}} available by permit only, but camping is allowed {{in most of these}} backcountry zones year-round. The National Park Service has a combination of specific sites and zones for backcountry camping with a set carrying capacity of overnight stays per zone to protect the resources from overcrowding. Open fires are not permitted in the backcountry and all food must be stored in an Interagency <b>Grizzly</b> <b>Bear</b> Committee approved bear-resistant container. As of 2012, only four brands of bear-resistant containers had been approved for use in the Grand Teton National Park backcountry. Additionally, hikers may use an approved bear spray to elude aggressive bears.|$|E
5|$|Bears of {{northern}} regions, including the American black bear and the <b>grizzly</b> <b>bear,</b> hibernate in the winter. During hibernation, the bear's metabolism slows down, its body temperature decreases slightly, and its heart rate slows from a normal value of 55 to just 9 beats per minute. Bears normally do not wake during their hibernation, and can go the entire period without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating. A fecal plug is {{formed in the}} colon, and is expelled when the bear wakes in the spring. If they have stored enough body fat, their muscles remain in good condition, and their protein maintenance requirements are met from recycling waste urea. Female bears give birth during the hibernation period, and are roused when doing so.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>grizzly</b> <b>bears</b> and other predators is mostly one-sided; <b>grizzly</b> <b>bears</b> will approach feeding predators to steal their kill. In general, the other species {{will leave the}} carcasses for the bear to avoid competition or predation. Any parts of the carcass left uneaten are scavenged by smaller animals.|$|R

40|$|My {{research}} {{represents the}} predator (wolves, Canis lupus, and <b>grizzly</b> <b>bears,</b> Ursus arctos) {{component of a}} collaborative endeavor to examine processes that structure the multi-predator multi-prey system of the undisturbed Besa-Prophet watershed in the northern Rocky Mountains, northeastern British Columbia, Canada. It incorporated seasonal movements and range use, resource selection models, and isotopic assessments of prey selection to better understand predator use of the landscape. Mean annual range sizes of five wolf packs and 13 female <b>grizzly</b> <b>bears</b> were 801 [plus or minus] 118 km² and 334 [plus or minus] 33 km², respectively. Sizes of annual, denning and late-summer ranges of wolves were proportional {{to the extent of}} conifer habitat and related to pack size, whereas winter and late-winter ranges appeared to be a function of movement rates. Most wolf packs used lower elevations during the winter and late-winter seasons and higher elevations during denning, late summers, and fall. Wolves showed highest selection for areas of high habitat diversity. They tended to select shrub habitats year-round and burned habitat classes seasonally, and avoided confer classes. For <b>grizzly</b> <b>bears,</b> sizes of annual home ranges were inversely related to the extent of available Elymus-dominated burns; and seasonal ranges and movement rates were a function of family status. <b>Grizzly</b> <b>bears</b> generally were found at higher elevations during spring, lower elevations during fall, and across elevational gradients during summer. Shrub and burned habitat classes were important to <b>grizzly</b> <b>bears</b> year-round, and conifer classes were consistently avoided. Habitat selection by <b>grizzly</b> <b>bears</b> was best predicted from habitat class, elevation, aspect, and vegetation diversity. Moose (Alces alces) and elk (Cervus elaphus) dominated the diets of wolves. Both male and female <b>grizzly</b> <b>bears</b> increased meat intake (primarily elk) in the fall and males consumed more meat that females throughout the year. Estimates of prey proportions in the diets of wolves and <b>grizzly</b> <b>bears</b> were highly sensitive to the fractionation values incorporated in isotope models. This research provides a comprehensive analysis of habitat selection and habitat use by wolves and <b>grizzly</b> <b>bears</b> that contributes to the long-term management and persistence of these populations.

5|$|Larger {{animals are}} not as common, but are still present. A <b>grizzly</b> <b>bear</b> was photographed near Cascade pass in October2010, {{and as many as}} twenty grizzlies may be living in the Cascades, south of the Canada–US border. Wolves, pine martens lynx, wolverines, cougars, weasels, and black bears are also present, and are usually {{detected}} by camera traps. During the summer, bears consume up to 30,000 calories a day in preparation for hibernation, in a dietary phase known as hyperphagia. There have also been attempts to re-introduce fishers to the region. Cougars are mainly nocturnal and solitary, and are so secretive that they are seldom seen. Wolves were eradicated from the Cascades by the 1930s, but began re-establishing resident packs at least as early as 1990.|$|E
5|$|Over 152 {{species of}} birds are known or {{suspected}} {{to live in the}} Big Butte Creek watershed, including the northern goshawk and the northern spotted owl, a vulnerable species. Bald eagles nest around Willow Lake. Amphibians such as the vulnerable Oregon spotted frog and the near threatened Cascades frog inhabit some regions of the watershed. Black-tailed deer, Roosevelt elk, cougars, and black bears are the most common of the 63 species of mammals found in the watershed. Fishers and American martens have also been spotted. The gray wolf and the vulnerable <b>grizzly</b> <b>bear</b> once lived in the watershed, but are now considered extirpated. Nineteen species of reptiles live in the area. Other sensitive species include the wolverine, the western pond turtle, the sandhill crane, and Townsend's big-eared bat.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Schwarzkopf {{published}} a memoir, It Doesn't Take a Hero, about his life; {{it became a}} bestseller. Schwarzkopf sold the rights to his memoirs to Bantam Books for $5,000,000. In 1993, Schwarzkopf {{was found to have}} prostate cancer, for which he was successfully treated. Among the many honors he received was the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2002. Queen Elizabeth II honorarily knighted Schwarzkopf and he was awarded many other military accolades from foreign countries. He led the Pegasus Parade at the Kentucky Derby and was an honorary guest at the Indianapolis 500. He supported several children's charities and national philanthropic causes, and he was a spokesperson for prostate cancer awareness, recovery of the <b>grizzly</b> <b>bear</b> from endangered species status, and served on the Nature Conservancy board of governors. Schwarzkopf otherwise sought to live out a low-profile retirement in Tampa, though he briefly served as a military commentator for NBC.|$|E

5|$|Restoring the {{primitive}} scene {{is not done}} easily nor can it be done completely. Some species are extinct. Given time, an eastern hardwood forest can be regrown to maturity but the chestnut will be missing and so will the roar of pigeon wings. The colorful drapanid finches {{are not to be}} heard again in the lowland forests of Hawaii, nor will the jack-hammer of the ivory-bill ring in southern swamps. The wolf and <b>grizzly</b> <b>bear</b> cannot readily be reintroduced into ranching communities, and the factor of human use of the parks is subject only to regulation, not elimination. Exotic plants, animals, and diseases are here to stay. All these limitations we fully realize. Yet, if the goal cannot be fully achieved it can be approached. A reasonable illusion of primitive America could be recreated, using the utmost in skill, judgment, and ecologic sensitivity. This in our opinion should be the objective of every national park and monument.|$|E
5|$|Shoshone National Forest has {{virtually}} all the original animal and plant species that were there when white explorers such as John Colter and Jim Bridger first visited the region. The forest {{is home to the}} <b>Grizzly</b> <b>bear,</b> cougar, moose, tens of thousands of elk as well as the largest herd of bighorn sheep in the U.S. The streams in the forest are considered to have some of the best game species fishing opportunities in the U.S. including Yellowstone cutthroat trout. More than 1,300 miles of hiking trails, 32 campgrounds and adjacent forests and parklands provide numerous recreational opportunities. There are four wilderness areas within the forest, protecting {{more than half of the}} managed land area from development. From sagebrush plains through dense spruce and fir forest to craggy mountain peaks, Shoshone National Forest has a rich biodiversity rarely matched in any protected area.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park is {{the only}} U.S. National Park that permits hunting, but only of elk {{in an effort to}} keep the populations of that species regulated. This {{provision}} was included in the legislation that combined Jackson Hole National Monument and Grand Teton National Park in 1950. While some National Parks in Alaska permit subsistence hunting by indigenous natives and a few other National Park Service managed areas allow hunting under highly regulated circumstances, hunting in U.S. National Parks is not generally allowed. In Grand Teton National Park, hunters are required to obtain Wyoming hunting licenses and be deputized as park rangers. Hunting is restricted to areas east of the Snake River and north of Moran, Wyoming, the hunt is permitted only east of U.S. Route 89. Proponents of continuing the elk hunt, which occurs in the fall, argue that the elk herd would become overpopulated without it, leading to vegetation degradation from overgrazing elk herds. Opponents cite that there has been an increase of predators such as the wolf and <b>grizzly</b> <b>bear</b> in Grand Teton National Park, rendering the annual hunt unnecessary and exposing hunters to attacks by grizzly bears as they become accustomed to feeding on remains left behind from the hunt.|$|E
