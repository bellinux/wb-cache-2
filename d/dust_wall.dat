Models of the associated accretion shock qualitatively explain the observed distribution of excess fluxes in the Balmer discontinuity for a large ensemble of Herbig Ae/Be stars, and imply typically small mass accretion rates, < 10 ^{- 7 } Msun/yr. In order for accretion to proceed onto the star, significant amounts of gas must exist inside the dust destruction radius, which is potentially problematic for recently advocated scenarios of "puffed" inner <b>dust</b> <b>wall</b> geometries. However, our models of the inner gas disk show that for the typical accretion rates we have derived, the gas should be generally optically thin, thus allowing direct stellar irradiation of the inner dust edge of the disk.

Here we calculate the inner <b>dust</b> sublimation <b>wall</b> properties for four classical T Tauri stars with a narrow range of spectral types and inclination angles and {{a wide range of}} mass accretion rates {{to determine the extent to}} which the walls are radially curved. Best-fits to the near- and mid-IR excesses are found for curved, 2 -layer walls in which the lower layer contains larger, hotter, amorphous pyroxene grains with Mg/(Mg+Fe) = 0. 6 and the upper layer contains submicron, cooler, mixed amorphous olivine and forsterite grains. As the mass accretion rates decrease from 10 ^(- 8) to 10 ^(- 10) Msol/yr, the maximum grain size in the lower layer decreases from 3 to 0. 5 microns. We attribute this to a decrease in fragmentation and turbulent support for micron-sized grains with decreasing viscous heating. The atmosphere of these disks is depleted of dust with dust-gas mass ratios 1 x 10 ^(- 4) of the ISM value, while the midplane is enhanced to 8 times the ISM value. For all accretion rates, the wall contributes at least half of the flux in the optically thin 10 micron silicate feature. Finally, we find evidence for an iron gradient in the disk, suggestive of that found in our solar system. Comment: 18 pages, 12 figures, 1 table, accepted to Ap...|$|R

A subclass of transitional disks, the so-called cold disks with large inner dust holes, provide a crucial laboratory for studying disk dissipation processes. IRS 48 has a 30 AU radius hole previously measured from dust continuum imaging at 18. 7 micron. Using new optical spectra, we determine that IRS 48 is a pre-main sequence A 0 star. In order to characterize this disk's gas distribution, we obtained AO-assisted VLT CRIRES high resolution (R ~ 100, 000) spectra of the CO fundamental rovibrational band at 4. 7 micron. All CO emission, including that from isotopologues and vibrationally excited molecules, is off-source and peaks at 30 AU. The gas is thermally excited to a rotational temperature of 260 K and is also strongly UV pumped, showing a vibrational excitation temperature of ~ 5000 K.

40|$|Using NASA IRTF SpeX {{data from}} 0. 8 to 4. 5 μm, we {{determine}} self-consistently the stellar properties and excess emission above the photosphere for {{a sample of}} classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) in the Taurus molecular cloud {{with varying degrees of}} accretion. This process uses a combination of techniques from the recent literature as well as observations of weak-line T Tauri stars (WTTS) to account for the differences in surface gravity and chromospheric activity between the TTS and dwarfs, which are typically used as photospheric templates for CTTS. Our improved veiling and extinction estimates for our targets allow us to extract flux-calibrated spectra of the excess in the near-infrared. We find that we are able to produce an acceptable parametric fit to the near-infrared excesses using a combination of up to three blackbodies. In half of our sample, two blackbodies at temperatures of 8000 K and 1600 K suffice. These temperatures and the corresponding solid angles are consistent with emission from the accretion shock on the stellar surface and the inner dust sublimation rim of the disk, respectively. In contrast, the other half requires three blackbodies at 8000, 1800, and 800 K, to describe the excess. We interpret the combined two cooler blackbodies as the <b>dust</b> sublimation <b>wall</b> with either a contribution from the disk surface beyond the wall or curvature of the wall itself, neither of which should have single-temperature blackbody emission.

Parameters for assessing control included observation of foragers, homeowner observations, and a final inspection the following spring. Efficacy of baits was investigated over five years and found to have 77 % to 90 % control. Liquids with boric acid required an average of 11. 1 weeks for control, and hydramethylnon granules required 10 weeks. Both achieved 100 % control. Fipronil granules had a 92 % control in an average of 5. 9 weeks, but the avermectin granules did not achieve control. Fipronil gel had a 76 % control in 6. 6 weeks.

The central peak is extended 0. 4 " N-S and unresolved (= 2 pc^ 2, and may thus contain a compact source such as a parsec-scale torus. We observe a correspondence between the northern extension and the northeastern sources appearing on the mid-infrared images and the [OIII] clouds A-C & E. We interpret the faint optical counterpart to the mid-infrared southern extension as being due to partial obscuration by the intervening disk of the host galaxy.

We compare the images and the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) observed to a 2 D, axis-symmetric dust radiative transfer model that reproduces VLTI/MIDI observations of the MYSO W 33 A. We vary the inclination, mass infall rate, and outflow opening angle to simultaneously recreate the behaviour of the sample of MYSOs in the spatial and spectral domains. The mid-IR emission of 70 percent of the MYSOs is spatially resolved. In the majority of cases, the spatial extent of their emission and their SEDs can be reproduced by the W 33 A model featuring an in-falling, rotating dusty envelope with outflow cavities. There is independent evidence that most of the sources which are not fit by the model are associated with ultracompact HII regions and are thus more evolved. We find that, in general, the diverse 20 micron morphology of MYSOs can be attributed to warm <b>dust</b> in the <b>walls</b> of outflow cavities seen at different inclinations. This implies that the warm dust in the outflow cavity walls dominates the Q-band emission of MYSOs. In turn, this emphasises that outflows are an ubiquitous feature of massive star formation. Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A. The images in this version have been compressed. A high resolution version is available on reques...|$|R
6000|$|If all {{stories were}} true, Dr. Heidegger's study {{must have been}} a very curious place. It was a dim, old-fashioned chamber festooned with cobwebs and besprinkled with antique <b>dust.</b> Around the <b>walls</b> stood several oaken bookcases, the lower shelves of which were filled with rows of {{gigantic}} folios and black-letter quartos, and the upper with little parchment-covered duodecimos. Over the central bookcase was a bronze bust of Hippocrates, with which, according to some authorities, Dr. Heidegger was accustomed to hold consultations in all difficult cases of his practice. In the obscurest corner of the room stood a tall and narrow oaken closet with its door ajar, within which doubtfully appeared a skeleton. Between two of the bookcases hung a looking-glass, presenting its high and dusty plate within a tarnished gilt frame. Among many wonderful stories related of this mirror, it was fabled that the spirits of all the doctor's deceased patients dwelt within its verge and would stare him in the face whenever he looked thitherward. The opposite side of the chamber was ornamented with the full-length portrait of a young lady arrayed in the faded magnificence of silk, satin and brocade, and with a visage as faded as her dress. Above half a century ago Dr. Heidegger had been on the point of marriage with this young lady, but, being affected with some slight disorder, she had swallowed one of her lover's prescriptions and died on the bridal-evening. The greatest curiosity of the study remains to be mentioned: it was a ponderous folio volume bound in black leather, with massive silver clasps. There were no letters on the back, and nobody could tell the title of the book. But it was well known to be a book of magic, and once, when a chambermaid had lifted it merely to brush away the dust, the skeleton had rattled in its closet, the picture of the young lady had stepped one foot upon the floor and several ghastly faces had peeped forth from the mirror, while the brazen head of Hippocrates frowned and said, [...] "Forbear!" ...|$|R
40|$|More than 150 {{species of}} {{mycobacteria}} are described, most being opportunistic pathogens and all representing a risk for {{human and animal}} health. Human infections derived from environmental mycobacteria are increasing in both industrialized and developing countries. The most susceptible groups are children, the elderly and those, including animals, with immunocompressive conditions. Drug therapy for mycobacteriosis is difficult and not always successful. Infections caused by drug-resistant mycobacteria can be life threatening also for healthy adults and thus represent a real risk for humans. Environmental mycobacterial infections of pigs are usually without clinical signs and the lesions are mainly detected at slaughter. Mycobacterium-infected pork can pass for human consumption due to the poor sensitivity of visual meat control at slaughterhouses, and mycobacteria in pigs also cause economic losses due to condemnation of carcasses. The main challenge is represented by evaluation of the hygiene risk associated with using mycobacteria-contaminated pork. Most environmental mycobacteria species have been isolated from sources such as water, swimming pools, soil, plants and bedding material. In our study mycobacterial growth in piggeries was identified in all bedding materials, sawdust, straw, peat and wood chips in most cases, and water and food samples in many cases, and only occasionally in <b>dust</b> and on <b>wall</b> surfaces. The maximum number of mycobacteria was almost 1 billion (109) per gram of bedding, which {{is close to the}} maximum concentration in any growth media. Mycobacteria can multiply in piggeries and contaminate feed and water. Isolation of mycobacteria from pig faeces can be considered an indicator for risk of human infection. Environmental mycobacteriosis in humans and pigs is mainly caused by M. avium subsp. hominissuis. There is little evidence of direct transmission from animals to humans, but particular strains can be recovered from both humans and pigs. In our studies, identical mycobacteria RFLP and MIRU-VNTR fingerprints of porcine and human origins were evident. Interspecies clusters were more common than intraspecies clusters using both methods. Therefore, we concluded that pigs act as a reservoir for virulent M. avium strains and the vector for transmission of infections in humans to pigs, and vice versa, may have an identical source of infection. Culturing mycobacteria is the gold standard for diagnosis, but detection of environmental mycobacteria based on cultivation and biochemical methods can take several weeks. Culture-independent, rapid and accurate techniques for detecting mycobacteria in food and feed chains are urgently needed. In this work we developed a rapid and accurate real-time quantitative PCR for detecting environmental mycobacteria in bedding materials and pig organs. Conclusion: Mycobacteria can multiply in bedding materials and the consequent heavy contamination can cause simultaneous infections in pigs. Mycobacterial DNA was found in pig organ samples, including those without lesions, and similar strains were found from humans and pig organ samples, which suggests that mycobacteria can be transmitted between humans and pigs...|$|R
