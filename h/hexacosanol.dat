40|$|In the cuticular wax {{mixtures}} from {{leaves of}} pea (Pisum sativum) cv Avanta, cv Lincoln, and cv Maiperle, more than 70 individual compounds were identified. The adaxial wax {{was characterized by}} very high amounts of primary alcohols (71 %), while the abaxial wax consisted mainly of alkanes (73 %). An aqueous adhesive of gum arabic was employed to selectively sample the epicuticular wax layer on pea leaves and hence to analyze the composition of epicuticular crystals exposed at the outermost surface of leaves. The epicuticular layer was found to contain 74 % and 83 % of the total wax on adaxial and abaxial surfaces, respectively. The platelet-shaped crystals on the adaxial leaf surface consisted of a mixture dominated by <b>hexacosanol,</b> accompanied by substantial amounts of octacosanol and hentriacontane. In contrast, the ribbon-shaped wax crystals on the abaxial surface consisted mainly of hentriacontane (63 %), with approximately 5 % each of <b>hexacosanol</b> and octacosanol being present. Based on this detailed chemical analysis of the wax exposed at the leaf surface, their importance for early events in the interaction with host-specific pathogenic fungi can now be evaluated. On adaxial surfaces, approximately 80 % of Erysiphe pisi spores germinated and 70 % differentiated appressoria. In contrast, significantly lower germination efficiencies (57 %) and appressoria formation rates (49 %) were found for abaxial surfaces. In conclusion, {{the influence of the}} physical structure and the chemical composition of the host surface, and especially of epicuticular leaf waxes, on the prepenetration processes of biotrophic fungi is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Policosanol is {{a mixture}} of {{long-chain}} primary alcohols that has been shown to decrease serum cholesterol in animals and in humans. The hypocholesterolemic effect results from a de-crease in cholesterol synthesis by suppression of HMG-CoA reductase activity, but the mechanism of this suppression and the active components of policosanol have not been estab-lished. In the present study, we investigated the ability of poli-cosanol and its principal components to inhibit cholesterol synthesis in cultured rat hepatoma cells. Maximal inhibition by policosanol yielded a 30 % decrease in [14 C]acetate incorpora-tion without evidence of cellular toxicity. Octacosanol (C 28, the major constituent of policosanol), heptacosanol (C 27), and <b>hexacosanol</b> (C 26) yielded smaller and statistically insignificant decreases in cholesterol synthesis, whereas triacontanol (1...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the total lipid fraction from the Sayali variety of olive oil was accomplished in the present investigation. Glyceridic, unsaponifiable and flavour fractions of the oil were isolated and identified using several analytical methods. Chromatographic techniques {{have proven to be}} suitable for these determinations, especially capillary gas chromatography. Gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry was successfully used to identify sterols, triterpenes alcohols, 4 -monomethylsterols, aliphatic alcohols and aroma compounds in our samples. Furthermore, solid phase microextraction was used to isolate volatiles from the total lipid fraction. Results from the quantitative characterization of Sayali olive oil showed that oleic acid (77. 4 %) and triolein (47. 4 %) were the dominant glyceridic components. However, the main compounds of the unsaponifiable fraction were b-sitosterol (147. 5 mg/ 100 g oil), 24 -methylene cycloartenol (146. 4 mg/ 100 g oil) and <b>hexacosanol</b> (49. 3 mg/ 100 g oil).

"Krakowianka" and "Sopel lodu" were studied. The received results showed that triacontanol was characterized by higher physiological activity than remaining alcohols. TRIA significantly increased yield of mass, {{as well as it}} changed the pattern of distribution of assimilates in plants. Under its influence the rate of mass of leaves to mass of storage organs decreased as well as the share of mass of leaves in the total mass of both plant cultivars. TRIA stimulated the rate of net photosynthesis (Pn), howewer, it did not influence the other detennined gas exchange parameters: substomatal concentration of CO 2 (ci), stomatal conductance for water vapour (gs) and rate of transpiration (Tr).

40|$|The {{results of}} our {{previous}} investigations on extracts of selected marine algae showed that Caulerpa peltata and Padina gymnospora had more promising antiproliferative and antioxidant activities than Gelidiella acerosa and Sargassum wightii. Based on these results, the more active chloroform extract of C. peltata and ethyl acetate extract of P. gymnospora were further analyzed for their constituents by using gas chromatography in tandem with mass spectrometry. The GC-MS analysis (GC % peak area given in parentheses) showed that fucosterol (12. 45 %) and L-(+) -ascorbic acid 2, 6 -dihexadecanoate (8. 13 %) were the major compounds present in P. gymnospora ethyl acetate extract. On the other hand, C. peltata chloroform extract had 1 -heptacosanol (10. 52 %), <b>hexacosanol</b> acetate (9. 28 %), tetradecyl ester of chloroacetic acid (7. 22 %), Z,Z- 6, 28 -heptatriactontadien- 2 -one (6. 77 %) and 10, 13 -dimethyl-methyl ester of tetradecanoic acid (5. 34 %) as major compounds.

Method. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the effects of barley sprout extract on serum lipid metabolism in healthy volunteers (n= 51). Subjects were randomly divided into two groups: one group consumed a single capsule of barley leaf extract daily (n= 25, 42. 48 ± 13. 58 years) and the other consumed placebo capsules (n= 26, 40. 54 ± 11. 1 years) for 12 weeks. Results. After 12 weeks, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein- (LDL-) cholesterol were not lower in the barley sprout extract group compared to the placebo group (p= 0. 415 and p= 0. 351, resp.) and no differences in clinical or laboratory findings were observed between both groups. Conclusion. Our study failed to show significant lipid-lowering effects of barley sprout extract, possibly due to dosage, duration of therapy, and small sample size.

40|$|Pomace {{olive oil}} is a {{by-product}} of olive oil extraction that is traditionally produced and consumed in Spain. The nonglyceride matter of this oil is {{a good source of}} interesting minor compounds, like long-chain fatty alcohols, which are present free or as part of waxes. In the present study, long-chain fatty alcohols were isolated from the nonglyceride fraction of pomace olive oil, and the composition was identified and quantified. The major components of long-chain fatty alcohols were tetracosanol, <b>hexacosanol</b> and octacosanol. We investigated the ability of long-chain fatty alcohols from pomace olive oil to inhibit the release of different proinflammatory mediators in vitro by cells involved in inflammatory processes. Long-chain fatty alcohols significantly and dose-dependently decreased nitric oxide production by RAW 264. 7 murine macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Western blot analysis showed that nitric oxide reduction was a consequence of the inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthetase expression. Long-chain fatty alcohols also reduced tumor necrosis factor-α and prostaglandin E 2 production, although the potency of inhibition for the latter was lower. On the other hand, long-chain fatty alcohols significantly reduced thromboxane A 2 production in rat peritoneal neutrophils stimulated with the calcium ionophore A- 23187. The reduction of eicosanoid release was related to the inhibition of phospholipase A 2 enzyme activity by long-chain fatty alcohols, reaching an inhibitory concentration 50 % value of 6. 2 μg/ml. These results showed that long-chain fatty alcohols may have a protective effect on some mediators involved in the inflammatory damage development, suggesting its potential value as a putative functional component of pomace olive oil.
