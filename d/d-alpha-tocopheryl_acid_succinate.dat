50|$|The glyoxylate cycle {{bypasses}} {{the steps}} in the citric acid cycle where carbon is lost {{in the form of}} CO2. The two initial steps of the glyoxylate cycle are identical to those in the citric acid cycle: acetate → citrate → isocitrate. In the next step, catalyzed by the first glyoxylate cycle enzyme, isocitrate lyase, isocitrate undergoes cleavage into succinate and glyoxylate (the latter gives the cycle its name). Glyoxylate condenses with acetyl-CoA (a step catalyzed by malate synthase), yielding malate. Both malate and oxaloacetate can be converted into phosphoenolpyruvate, which is the product of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, the first enzyme in gluconeogenesis. The net result of the glyoxylate cycle is therefore the production of glucose from fatty <b>acids.</b> <b>Succinate</b> generated in the first step can enter into the citric acid cycle to eventually form oxaloacetate.|$|R

To understand the impact of B. licheniformis on Daqu, the fermentation behaviour of B. licheniformis was studied using 1 H NMR-based non-targeted analysis and principal component analysis. During the fermentation, 53 compounds were identified. Among them, seven compounds were largely consumed and 17 metabolites were largely accumulated. The macromolecular starch and cellulose were degraded by B. licheniformis, and then utilized to produce acetic acid, lactic <b>acid,</b> propionic <b>acid,</b> <b>succinate</b> <b>acid,</b> etc. Principal component analysis was carried out to study the variations of analytes during the fermentation. Samples collected at each time point could be clearly discriminated and the biomarkers of each time point were defined. A variety of biochemical compounds (such as acetate, ethanol, lactate, pyruvate, malate, maltose and sucrose) were changed during the fermentation of B. licheniformis. The results are useful to reveal how and why B. licheniformis becomes dominant in Daqu, and to reveal its impact on the aroma formation of Daqu and its derived products. </p...|$|R

We demonstrate {{here for the first time}} a new generation of synthesized elastomers, namely bio-based engineering elastomers (BEE). These are of particular significance because they are synthesized from monomers derived from biomass, by routes which are suitable for large scale production, and they exhibit thermo-mechanical properties at least equivalent to current commercial petrochemical-derived elastomers. Bio-based monomers in large scale production, such as sebacic <b>acid,</b> itaconic <b>acid,</b> <b>succinate</b> <b>acid,</b> 1, 3 -propanediol, and 1, 4 butanediol are chosen to generate the first synthetic BEE matrix through melting polycondensation—a comparatively simple reaction scheme offering good control and the potential for low cost, large-scale production.

Plasmid pTrc 99 A-pyc, which expresses the Rhizobium etli pyruvate carboxylase enzyme, was introduced into both strains. We compared growth, substrate consumption, product formation, {{and activities of}} seven key enzymes (acetate kinase, fumarate reductase, glucokinase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, isocitrate lyase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, and pyruvate carboxylase) from glucose for NZN 111, NZN 111 /pTrc 99 A-pyc, AFP 111, and AFP 111 /pTrc 99 A-pyc under both exclusively anaerobic and dual-phase conditions (an aerobic growth phase followed by an anaerobic production phase). The highest succinate mass yield was attained with AFP 111 /pTrc 99 A-pyc under dual-phase conditions with low pyruvate carboxylase activity. Dual-phase conditions led to significant isocitrate lyase activity in both NZN 111 and AFP 111, while under exclusively anaerobic conditions, an absence of isocitrate lyase activity resulted in significant pyruvate accumulation. Enzyme assays indicated that under dual-phase conditions, carbon flows not only through the reductive arm of the tricarboxylic <b>acid</b> cycle for <b>succinate</b> generation but also through the glyoxylate shunt and thus provides the cells with metabolic flexibility {{in the formation of}} succinate.

Methods: The binding of metoprolol succinate to bovine serum albumin (BSA) was studied by equilibrium dialysis method (ED) at 27 °C and pH 7. 4, in order to have an insight in the binding chemistry of the drug to BSA in presence and absence of palmitic acid. The study was carried out using ranitidine as site- 1 and diazepam as site- 2 specific probe.

Using a quantitative capillary assay to measure chemotaxis, we tested the ability of hydroaromatic acids, selected aromatic acids, and their metabolites to serve as chemoattractants for two distantly related rhizobial species, Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Rhizobium trifolii. Slow-growing B. japonicum I- 110 demonstrated positive chemotaxis to shikimate, quinate, protocatechuate, and vanillate; threshold concentrations for the compounds were as low as 10 (- 6) M.

40|$|Alanine {{dehydrogenase}} (AldA) is {{the principal}} enzyme with which pea bacteroids synthesize alanine de novo. In free-living culture, AldA activity is induced by carboxylic <b>acids</b> (<b>succinate,</b> malate, and pyruvate), although the best inducer is alanine. Measurement of the intracellular concentration of alanine showed that AldA contributes to net alanine synthesis in laboratory cultures. Divergently transcribed from aldA is an AsnC type regulator, aldR. Mutation of aldR prevents induction of AldA activity. Plasmid-borne gusA fusions showed that aldR is required for transcription of both aldA and aldR; hence, AldR is autoregulatory. However, plasmid fusions containing the aldA-aldR intergenic region could apparently titrate out AldR, sometimes resulting in a complete loss of AldA enzyme activity. Therefore, integrated aldR::gusA and aldA::gusA fusions, as well as Northern blotting, were used to confirm the induction of aldA activity. Both aldA and aldR were expressed in the II/III interzone and zone III of pea nodules. Overexpression of aldA in bacteroids did not alter the ability of pea plants to fix nitrogen, as measured by acetylene reduction, but caused a large reduction in the size and dry weight of plants. This suggests that overexpression of aldA impairs the ability of bacteroids to donate fixed nitrogen that the plant can productively assimilate. We propose {{that the role of}} AldA may be to balance the alanine level for optimal functioning of bacteroid metabolism rather than to synthesize alanine as the sole product of N 2 reduction...|$|R

In this study, a system biology tool, metabolomics, was applied to the marine mussel Perna viridis to investigate changes in the metabolic profiles of soft tissue as a response to copper (Cu) and cadmium (Cd), both as single metal and as a mixture. The major metabolite changes corresponding to metal exposure are related to amino acids, osmolytes, and energy metabolites. Following metal exposure for 1 week, there was {{a significant increase in the}} levels of branched chain amino acids, histidine, glutamate, glutamine, hypotaurine, dimethylglycine, arginine and ATP/ADP. For the Cu+Cd co-exposed mussels, the levels of lactate, branched chain amino <b>acid,</b> <b>succinate,</b> and NAD increased, whereas the levels of glucose, glycogen, and ATP/ADP decreased, indicating a different metabolic profile for the single metal exposure groups. After 2 weeks of exposure, the mussels showed acclimatization to Cd exposure based on the recovery of some metabolites. However, the metabolic profile induced by the metal mixture was very similar to that from Cu exposure, suggesting that Cu dominantly induced the metabolic disturbances. Both Cu and Cd may lead to neurotoxicity, disturbances in energy metabolism, and osmoregulation changes. These results demonstrate the high applicability and reliability of NMR-based metabolomics in interpreting the toxicological mechanisms of metals using global metabolic biomarkers.

40|$|Summary. Nodule {{mitochondria}} {{are highly}} {{sensitive to the}} respiratory inhibitor antimycine A. The antimycine-resistant oxygen uptake is 5 – 10 % of the rate of control mitochondrial respiration. The high sensitivity to this inhibitor means that non-phosphorilating pathways are absent from the nodules and the energetic effectiveness of mitochondria is very high. The latter is proved by the good respiratory control, observed in mitochondria from soybean plant nodules. Mitochondria, isolated from nodules of plants that are treated with succinate and α-ketoglutarate during inoculation showed highest respiratory control. A {{significant differences in the}} rate of oxygen uptake by mitochondria isolated from soybean plant nodules were observed in all treatments investigated. The rates of oxygen consumption by mitochondria isolated from nodules of citrate treated plants were close to these of the control plants. However, treatment with succinate, malate and α-ketoglutarate resulted in a significant increase of mitochondrial oxygen uptake. Our results support the relation between plant photosynthesis and bacteroid respiration. Photosynthetic intensity and the oxygen uptake of bacteroids were the lowest in control soybean plants and the ones treated with citrate during inoculation. In the cases when the intensity of photosynthesis was high (treatments with succinate, malate and α-ketoglutarate during inoculation), the rate of oxygen uptake of the bacteroids was the highest.

40|$|In a {{previous}} publication (1) evidence was presented impficating succinate and pyruvate quantitatively in the oxidative breakdown of acetic acid to CO 2 and water by acetate-adapted strains of Escherichia coli, while a-ketoglutaric acid was eliminated {{as a possible}} intermediate. In addition, fumarate, malate, and oxalacetate have also been shown, qualitatively at least, to participate as intermediates in the oxidation of the C 2 fatty acid. However, the occurrence of an unexpected side reaction, involving appreciable reduction of C 4 -dicarboxylic <b>acid</b> products of <b>succinate</b> oxidation back to succinate, complicated the interpretations of most experiments performed using carrier malate, fumarate, or oxalacetate. In this paper detailed data are presented which were obtained when 2 -C 14 acetate was incubated {{in the presence of}} fumarate, malate, 0 xalacetate, and a-ketoglutarate. Further, conditions will be described which reduce the unexpected reduction of the above mentioned C 4 -dicarboxylic <b>acids</b> back to <b>succinate.</b> From chemical analysis of the residual acids, CO~, and cell material...|$|R
40|$|Drug abuse {{has become}} a global problem. The mass spectrometry-based {{metabolic}} consequences of ketamine administration in anesthesia and therapy have been well studied, but {{to the best of}} our knowledge, metabolomic studies of ketamine abuse based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy are still lacking. In this study, twenty Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly assigned into two groups: a control group (n = 10) and a ketamine group (n = 10). The animals in the ketamine group received intraperitoneal injections of ketamine twice daily at 12 -h intervals at progressively increasing doses over a period of 9 days, while the control group received an equal volume of saline. The urine samples were collected for 24 h at days 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 for the metabolomics study. The metabolic changes in urine after short-term ketamine administration were analyzed by proton NMR coupled with multivariate statistical analysis. The results indicated that short-term ketamine exposure led to significant alterations of the metabolites in the urine of the rats. Specifically, 1, 3, 7 -trimethyluric acid, 1, 3 -dimethyluric acid, acetoacetic acid, acetylglycine, creatine, sarcosine, dimethylglycine, glycine, and theobromine were significantly increased in the urine. Significant changes were also found in metabolites related to antioxidant and energy metabolism, including acetoacetic <b>acid,</b> <b>succinate,</b> 1, 3, 7 -trimethyluric acid, 1, 3 -dimethyluric acid, creatine, and taurine. Our findings indicated that short-term ketamine administration leads to disorder of energy metabolism and oxidative stress. In addition, the modified metabolites identified could serve as the new biological markers and potential biological indices reflecting the underlying mechanism of ketamine abuse...|$|R
