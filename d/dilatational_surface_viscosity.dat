40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{framework is}} developed {{for measuring the}} dilatational rheological properties of gas-liquid interfaces by analyzing small amplitude radial oscillations of an air bubble blown into a liquid substrate. Contrary to earlier analyses which customarily require the bubble radius change during the oscillation, {{the present study is}} based on the readily measurable quantities of bubble pressure change during the oscillation and phase lag between the bubble pressure and the relative displacement of the oscillation generating device. To expose the extensive interrelationships among the various experimental parameters that {{have a profound effect on}} bubble dynamics, the analysis is focused on the influence of the variable gas volumes at the sides of the differential pressure transducer, the gas phase compressibility, the dynamic behavior of the transducer membrane and the bubble surface being only a segment of a sphere, as they play a key role in the response of the system. A linear viscoelastic surface behavior is assumed which includes intrinsic surface viscosities and Gibbs elasticities. New data are deduced from previous measurements on the dilatational surface properties of stearic acid monolayers which, being practically insoluble in water, offer an ideal experimental system without the complications due to bulk-interface interactions. For a fixed frequency of oscillation, a virtually constant <b>dilatational</b> <b>surface</b> <b>viscosity</b> is determined throughout the employed concentration range.

40|$|When a fluid {{interface}} with surfactants is at rest, the interfacial stress is isotropic (as {{given by the}} equilibrium interfacial tension), and is described by the equation of state which relates the surface tension to the surfactant surface concentration. When surfactants are subjected to shear and dilatational flows, flow induced interaction of the surfactants; can create interfacial stresses apart from the equilibrium surface tension. The simplest relationship between surface strain rate and surface stress is the Boussinesq-Scriven constitutive equation completely characterized by three coefficients: equilibrium interfacial tension, <b>surface</b> shear <b>viscosity,</b> and <b>surface</b> <b>dilatational</b> <b>viscosity</b> Equilibrium interfacial tension and <b>surface</b> shear <b>viscosity</b> measurements are very well established. On the other hand, <b>surface</b> <b>dilatational</b> <b>viscosity</b> measurements are difficult because a flow which change the surface area also changes the surfactant surface concentration creating changes in the equilibrium interfacial tension that must be also taken into account. <b>Surface</b> <b>dilatational</b> <b>viscosity</b> measurements of existing techniques differ by five orders of magnitude and use spatially damped surface waves and rapidly expanding bubbles. In this presentation we introduce a new technique for measuring the <b>surface</b> <b>dilatational</b> <b>viscosity</b> by contracting an aqueous pendant drop attached to a needle tip and having and insoluble surfactant monolayer at the air-water interface. The isotropic total tension on the surface consists of the equilibrium surface tension and the tension due to the dilation. Compression rates are undertaken slow enough so that bulk hydrodynamic stresses are small compared to the surface tension force. Under these conditions we show that the total tension is uniform along the surface and that the Young-Laplace equation governs the drop shape with the equilibrium surface tension replaced by the constant surface isotropic stress. We illustrate this technique using DPPC as the insoluble surfacant monolayer and measured for it a <b>surface</b> <b>dilatational</b> <b>viscosity</b> in the LE phase that is 20 surface poise...|$|R

We compare the time of formation and stability of foams prepared from fresh egg whites, with and without added copper ions.

The effect increases upon dilution of the egg whites, which shows that the bulk phase is {{not responsible for the}} increase in stability. Microscopy shows that the initial bubble size distribution of the foam is not affected by the addition of copper ions. Measurements with a ring trough show that the surface tension of the liquid vapor interface of the foam films is also unaffected.

40|$|Drainage of a mobile, symmetric, plane-parallel thin {{liquid film}} between two gas bubbles (foam film) is studied. An {{analytical}} {{solution for the}} rate of thinning of such a liquid film with an insoluble surfactant and having both film elasticity and <b>surface</b> <b>viscosity</b> is presented for the first time. Analysis is extended to the more general case of a soluble surfactant and compared with previous analyses. Surfactant material parameters affecting the rate of thinning are identified and grouped into a single dimensionless parameter, the surfactant number which describes {{the transition from a}} mobile to an immobile film. Significant deviation from the Reynolds velocity is found when this dimensionless parameter is small. Since draining foam or emulsion films are generally of nonuniform thickness with a thick region or 'dimple' as the central part and separated from the Plateau border by a thinner 'barrier ring', an analytical solution is not possible. Hence a numerical model was developed. This model simulates the hydrodynamics associated with the drainage of an axisymmetric, dimpled, mobile foam film with an insoluble surfactant. This extends the work of Joye (1994) which was limited to immobile films. Results of the parametric study indicate that the rate of drainage of these films is dependent on surfactant properties viz. elasticity, <b>surface</b> <b>dilatational</b> <b>viscosity,</b> <b>surface</b> shear <b>viscosity</b> and <b>surface</b> diffusivity. These properties are grouped into a single dimensionless parameter which is the same as obtained by our analytical solution for a plane parallel film and which correlates with the rate of drainage of the foam film. This parameter describes the transition from a mobile film to an immobile film. The simulations indicate considerable motion of the interface for draining mobile foam films. Foam texture in a porous medium is governed by the hydrodynamics of individual foam films (lamellae) flowing through pores of varying size. The stability of foam in a particular application depends upon the stability of a lamella in the porous medium, especially as the lamella expands in translating from a small pore (pore throat) to a larger pore (pore body). The numerical simulator developed above is extended to translating foam films to model the effect of various parameters on foam stability. The model predicts that the travelling lamella is unstable only for certain ranges of surfactant properties, porous media geometry and flow conditions, for e. g. gas flow rate and capillary pressure. Simulations show that mobile foam films stretch in going from a pore throat to a pore body and may thin down to the critical thickness and break, under certain conditions. In contrast immobile foam films are very stable due to an entrainment effect which occurs as the film expands in going from a pore throat to a pore body. The critical capillary pressure at which a moving lamella will break is determined as a function of film and porous medium properties. Further the concept of asymmetric drainage of foam films in porous media has been explored...|$|R

We develop a Navier–Stokes numerical model of the flow in the deep-channel surface viscometer geometry, which consists of stationary inner and outer cylinders, a floor rotating at a constant angular velocity, and an interface covered initially by a uniformly distributed surfactant. Here, the floor of the annular channel is rotated fast enough so the flow is nonlinear and drives the film toward the inner cylinder. The boundary conditions at the interface are functions of the surface tension, <b>surface</b> shear <b>viscosity,</b> and <b>surface</b> <b>dilatational</b> <b>viscosity,</b> as described by the Boussinesq–Scriven surface model. A physical surfactant system, namely hemicyanine, an insoluble monolayer on an air–water interface, with measured values of surface tension and <b>surface</b> shear <b>viscosity</b> versus concentration, was used in this study.

Measurements for essentially inviscid monolayers and some viscous monolayers on water show good agreement with numerical predictions for a Newtonian interface (Boussinesq–Scriven surface model) coupled to a bulk flow described by the Navier–Stokes equations. Here, we consider in detail a viscous monolayer, namely hemicyanine, and find that above a certain concentration, the monolayer does not behave Newtonian at a Reynolds number of about 250.

40|$|An {{unprecedented}} microgravity {{observation of}} maximal shape oscillations of a surfactant-bearing water drop {{the size of}} a ping pong ball was observed during a mission of Space Shuttle Columbia as part of the second United States Microgravity Laboratory-USML- 2 (STS- 73, October 20 -November 5, 1995). The observation was precipitated by the action of an intense sound field which produced a deforming force on the drop. When this deforming force was suddenly reduced, the drop executed nearly free and axisymmetric oscillations for several cycles, demonstrating a remarkable amplitude of nonlinear motion. Whether arising from the discussion of modes of oscillation of the atomic nucleus, or the explosion of stars, or how rain forms, the complex processes influencing the motion, fission, and coalescence of drops have fascinated scientists for centuries. Therefore, the axisymmetric oscillations of a maximally deformed liquid drop are noteworthy, not only for their scientific value but also for their aesthetic character. Scientists from Yale University, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Vanderbilt University conducted liquid drop experiments in microgravity using the acoustic positioning/manipulation environment of the Drop Physics Module (DPM).

The surface of the droplet is modelled by a Boussinesq–Scriven constitutive law involving the interfacial viscosities and a constant surface tension. A numerical method using Loop subdivision surfaces to represent droplet interface is introduced. This method couples boundary element method for fluid flows and finite element method {{to take into account}} the stresses due to the surface dilational and shear <b>viscosities</b> and <b>surface</b> tension. Validation of the numerical scheme with respect to previous analytic and computational work is provided, with particular attention to the viscosity contrast and the shear and dilational viscosities characterized both by a Boussinesq number Bq. Then, influence of equal <b>surface</b> <b>viscosities</b> on steady-state characteristics of a droplet in shear flow are studied, considering both small and large deformations and for a large range of bulk viscosity contrast. We find that small deformation analysis is surprisingly predictive at moderate and high <b>surface</b> <b>viscosities.</b> Equal <b>surface</b> <b>viscosities</b> decrease the Taylor deformation parameter and tank-treading angle and also strongly modify the dynamics of the droplet: when the Boussinesq number (<b>surface</b> <b>viscosity)</b> is large relative to the capillary number (surface tension), the droplet displays damped oscillations prior to steady-state tank-treading, reminiscent from the behaviour at large viscosity contrast. In the limit of infinite capillary number Ca, such oscillations are permanent. The influence of <b>surface</b> <b>viscosities</b> on breakup is also investigated, and results show that the critical capillary number is increased. A diagram (Bq;Ca) of breakup is established with the same inner and outer bulk viscosities. Additionally, the separate roles of shear and dilational <b>surface</b> <b>viscosity</b> are also elucidated, extending results from small deformation analysis. Indeed, shear (dilational) <b>surface</b> <b>viscosity</b> increases (decreases) the stability of drops to breakup under shear flow.

Specifically the fluid flow field transporting surfactant from foam Plateau borders (fed with surfactant-rich material) towards comparatively surfactant-lean foam films is considered.

Previous work (Vitasari et al., 2015) made assumptions about the likely flow field along the Plateau border surface.

40|$|International audienceLiquid foams absorb {{energy in}} a much more {{efficient}} way than each of its constituents, taken separately. However, the local process at the origin of the energy dissipation is not entirely elucidated yet, and several models may apply, thus making worth local studies on simpler systems. We investigate the motion through a wet tube of transverse soap films, or lamellae, combining local thickness and velocity measurements in the wetting film. For foaming solution with a high <b>dilatational</b> <b>surface</b> modulus, we reveal a zone of several centimeters in length, the dynamic wetting film, which is significantly influenced by a moving lamella. The dependence of this influence length on lamella velocity and wetting film thickness provides an accurate discrimination among several possible surfactants models...|$|R
40|$|Fluorescence {{microscopy}} {{images of}} UV irradiated monomolecular films of styrene-functionalized surfactants have complex domains without the fluorescence probe. We {{present the results}} obtained {{with one of these}} surfactants, di-n-octadecylmethy(p-vinylbenzyl) ammonium chloride (DOVAC), which suggests that these domains are clusters of polymeric molecules. The sizes of the domains were measured by an image analysis system and correlated with the relative <b>surface</b> <b>viscosity</b> of the film. When photopolymerization is performed at constant surface pressure, the mean area of the domains varies according to irradiation time and the value of the surface pressure. The relative <b>surface</b> <b>viscosity</b> of the polymerized films depends {{on the size of the}} domains and increases abruptly when the size of the polymerized domains reaches about 50 % of the total film area...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>surface</b> <b>viscosity</b> on {{the onset of}} surface tension driven {{instability}} in a horizontal thin liquid layer under a normal temperature gradient is analysed, using the linear stability theory. The free surface tangential stress balance is written following the microscopic theory of interfacial hydrodynamics. Then the neutral state when the upside or {{the underside of the}} liquid layer is the deformable free surface has been studied. In the first case the <b>surface</b> <b>viscosity</b> ηs inhibits Marangoni instability, while in the second it induces the contrary effect. Also in the underside case, for ηs ≠ 0 there is not any layer width d where the onset of convection changes from non-periodic to periodic structure, as it happens for ηs = 0...|$|R
40|$|The {{liquid in}} foam forms an {{interconnected}} network, which {{is composed of}} Plateau borders, nodes, and films. One of the dominant pathways for foam drainage is flow through Plateau borders, and we use confocal microscopy to obtain experimental results for the flow fields inside individual Plateau borders. For three types of surfactants detailed comparisons are made with a model based upon the influence of <b>surface</b> <b>viscosity</b> at free boundaries between the gas in the bubbles and the liquid in the Plateau borders. The model describes the flows well, and we find good agreement between the <b>surface</b> <b>viscosity</b> predicted by this model and representative values found in the literature. We also give a qualitative description of the flow in the nodes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt is {{generally}} accepted {{that the human}} neutrophil can be mechanically represented as a droplet of polymeric fluid enclosed by some sort of thin slippery viscoelastic cortex. Many questions remain however about the detailed rheology and chemistry of the interior fluid and the cortex. To address these quantitative issues, {{we have used a}} finite element method to simulate the dynamics of neutrophils during micropipet aspiration using various plausible assumptions. The results were then systematically compared with aspiration experiments conducted at eight different combinations of pipet size and pressure. Models in which the cytoplasm was represented by a simple Newtonian fluid (i. e., models without shear thinning) were grossly incapable of accounting for the effects of pressure on the general time scale of neutrophil aspiration. Likewise, models in which the cortex was purely elastic (i. e., models without <b>surface</b> <b>viscosity)</b> were unable to explain the effects of pipet size on the general aspiration rate. Such models also failed to explain the rapid acceleration of the aspiration rate during the final phase of aspiration nor could they account for the geometry of the neutrophil during various phases of aspiration. Thus, our results indicate that a minimal mechanical model of the neutrophil needs to incorporate both shear thinning and <b>surface</b> <b>viscosity</b> to remain valid over a reasonable range of conditions. At low shear rates, the <b>surface</b> dilatation <b>viscosity</b> of the neutrophil was found to be on the order of 100 poise-cm, whereas the viscosity of the interior cytoplasm was on the order of 1000 poise. Both the <b>surface</b> <b>viscosity</b> and the interior viscosity seem to decrease in a similar fashion when the shear rate exceeds ∼ 0. 05 s− 1. Unfortunately, even models with both <b>surface</b> <b>viscosity</b> and shear thinning studied are still not sufficient to fully explain all the features of neutrophil aspiration. In particular, the very high rate of aspiration during the initial moments after ramping of pressure remains mysterious...|$|R
