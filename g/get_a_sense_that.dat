At her sales job at Macy's, she meets a man named Beauregard Jackson Pickett Burnside (Forrest Tucker), a rich oil man from the South. He's immediately smitten with her and she falls in love with him as well, and he proposes to her on the spot in front of his family at their estate in Georgia. For their honeymoon, Beau and Mame travel around the world. Though Mame is sad about leaving Patrick, they keep in touch through letters and frequent visits during holidays. Through their correspondence, Mame <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the now-grown Patrick (Roger Smith) is growing into a stuffy, conventional man, and she worries for him.

40|$|Extract] O nce <b>an</b> {{observer}} <b>gets</b> {{past the}} stunning coloration, surely no feature inspires wonder in coral reef fishes {{so much as}} their morphological diversity. From large-mouthed groupers, to beaked parrotfish, barbeled goatfish, long-snouted trumpet fish, snaggle-toothed tusk fish, tube-mouthed planktivores, and fat-lipped sweet lips, coral reef fishes display a dazzling array of feeding structures. And, even the most casual fish watcher quickly <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> this diversity means something, that fish form is related to what the animals eat. Clearly {{there is something to}} this impression, but just how are head and body morphology connected to prey choice? Are we really able to predict what a reef fish eats from studying its jaws and teeth? What are the major axes of diversification that are seen in reef fishes? Which morphological and ecological trophic types show the most common convergence? What ecological insights into reef processes have been gained from consideration of the functional design of fish feeding mechanisms? In this chapter we explore the relationship between fish anatomy and feeding habits. Our overall goal is to show how an understanding of the functional morphology of fish feeding mechanisms can be a powerful tool when considering several ecological issues in coral reef fish biology. We have attempted to identify generalities, the major patterns that seem to cut across phylogenetic and geographic boundaries. We begin by constructing a rationale for how functional morphology can be used to enhance our insight into some long-standing ecological questions. We then review the fundamental mechanical issues associated with feeding in fishes, and the basic design features of the head that are involved in prey capture and prey processing. This sets the stage for a discussion of how the mechanical properties of fish feeding systems have been modified during reef fish diversification. With this background, we consider some of the major conclusions that have been drawn from studies of reef fish feeding ecomorphology. Because of space constraints we discuss only briefly the role of sensory modalities [...] vision, olfaction, electroreception, and hearingmbut these are also significant and diverse elements of the feeding arsenal of coral reef fishes and entire review chapters could be written on each one...|$|R

Introducing ICT's in developing countries has been attempted before with little success, but have resulted in experiences that can provide us with guidelines of how to avoid the same result. Further there is another motivation of introducing ICT's in the developing countries that relates to better the economy of developing countries which introduces the "learning economy". Then move on to a more broad contextual description of the case in order to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of <b>that</b> there are interconnected dependencies and we are not dealing with a isolated situation.
