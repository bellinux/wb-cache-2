40|$|A {{new method}} for calculating various {{properties}} of glasses and glass <b>forming</b> <b>melts</b> has been proposed. The method covers such properties as viscosity and standard points, density, heat capacity and enthalpy, refractive index and its dispersion, coefficient of thermal expan-sion, surface tension, elastic moduli, and ultrasonic ve-locities. Temperature dependences {{of the properties}} (except for elastic and acoustic properties) could also be calculated. The above mentioned properties could be calculated for glasses and glass <b>forming</b> <b>melts</b> belong-ing to various oxide systems: 64 oxides can {{be included in the}} calculation. The method is based on assuming chemical equilibria between structural groups, which are found in glass <b>forming</b> <b>melts.</b> The results of calculations have been compared with the experimental data for prop-erties of about 100000 glasses and glass <b>forming</b> <b>melts</b> using the MDL SciGlass information system. The re-sults of the comparison show that the proposed method allows the prediction of properties with a precision as high, on the whole, as the best known methods. The first system for the calculation of glass properties from their composition was proposed by Winkelmann & Schott(1 – 4) {{at the end of the}} 19 th century. Since then the calculation of glass properties has been the subject of hundreds of publications. The most recent attempt to summarise them is a monograph by Volf(5) published in 1985.

40|$|Poly(3 -alkythiophenes) (P 3 AT) {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} classes of electroactive polymers and represent a key component in a number of different organic electronic and photovoltaic devices which are being presently developed. Although extensive structural and morphological studies have been accumulating, only very few detailed atomistic models of the structural organization of these polymers have been developed. It is accepted that the structural organization of P 3 ATs commonly present in devices is the form I family, which is tightly stacked, yet generally disordered in ways that are difficult to detail. The study of the polymorphism of poly(3 -butylthiophene) on the other hand has evidenced that the enthalpically favoured but relatively rare form II polymorph is highly ordered, interdigitated and shows relatively loose stacking. This <b>form</b> <b>melts</b> surprisingly more than 100 °C below the disordered form I. A similar situation is found also in the more widely applied poly(3 -hexylthiophene) for which the stable form II is so rare that it has been reported only as an impurity so far. Detailed modelling with an ad-hoc developed forcefield is able to mirror in reasonable detail much of the described polymorphic behaviour opening viable perspectives to the study of disordered states of P 3 ATs...|$|E

40|$|Cereals {{are a large}} {{source of}} biopolymers, where mainly the starch is used for food and feed. A rapidly growing cereal {{application}} is the production of biofuel, mainly produced from corn in the US. The starch is fermented to ethanol leaving spent grain rich in cereal proteins as a by-product. The corn protein zein is currently extracted {{on a large scale}} and used in, for example, material applications. Similarly, pennisetin can be extracted from pearl millet, a crop critical for food security in sub-Saharan Africa. The formation of viscoelastic melts is crucial for (bio) plastics production and the viscoelasticity, microstructure, and molecular properties of zein and pennisetin melts were determined here. The proteins were mixed with plasticizers (polyethyleneglycol or glycerol/citric acid) to <b>form</b> <b>melts.</b> The melts displayed a phase separated microstructure with protein-rich and plasticizer-rich regions with distinctly separate Tgs. The pennisetin melts formed cross-links at temperatures above 60 degrees C, which could be related to the high content of cysteine and methionine, as compared to zein. As a consequence, pennisetin melts showed a more thermocomplex behavior than zein melts. For zein melts, the mixture of glycerol and citric acid interacted with protein {{in addition to being a}} plasticizer causing a high-molecular weight shoulder in the molecular weight distribution. The study showed that, although both zein and pennisetin form viscoelastic melts, the choice of plasticizer strongly affects both melt structure and physical properties...|$|E
40|$|We report temperature-jump kinetic {{studies of}} the early melting {{transition}} of Escherichia coli 5 S rRNA. A single measurable relaxation time tau, independent of concentration, was found at 266 nm. We monitored the transition temperature tm for this process (in the range from 0 to 40 degrees C) {{as a function of}} Mg 2 +, Na+, K+, spermidine, and H+ concentrations. Contrary to the usual effect of salts on nucleic acid stability, addition of mono- and multivalent counterions decreases tm for the early melting transition. Also unexpectedly, we found a strong dependence of tm on pH in the physiological range of 7 [...] 8. Quantitative analysis of the data indicates that about 0. 7 protons are release when the ordered (low-temperature) <b>form</b> <b>melts,</b> whereas about 2 NA+ (or K+) and 0. 5 Mg 2 + are taken up by the melted (high-temperature) form. We estimate the enthalpy of the transition to be 15 [...] 20 kcal/mol (63 [...] 84 kJ/mol) and also report the forward and reverse rate constants and activation energies for the transition, along with the influence of ions on the transition dynamics. Diffusion constant measurements reveal that the low-temperature form has a frictional coefficient about 10 % larger than that of the high-temperature form. The data imply a low-temperature tertiary structure capable of binding a proton. Increase of pH, temperature, or counterion concentration (all at near-physiological values) causes a tertiary conformational switch to a more compact form that has greater counterion binding but less proton binding. We discuss possible physiological roles for the transition...|$|E
40|$|Polymorphism, {{crystal shape}} and {{solubility}} of 1, 4 -dihydroxyanthraquinone (quinizarin) {{have been investigated}} in acetic acid, acetone, acetonitrile, n-butanol and toluene. The solubility of FI and FII from 20 degrees C to 45 degrees C has been determined by a gravimetric method. By slow evaporation, pure FI was obtained from n-butanol and toluene, pure FII was obtained from acetone, while either a mixture of the two forms or pure FI was obtained from acetic acid and acetonitrile. Slurry conversion experiments have established an enantiotropic {{relationship between the two}} polymorphs and that the commercially available FI is actually a metastable polymorph of quinizarin under ambient conditions. However, in the absence of FII, FI is kinetically stable for many days over the temperature range and in the solvents investigated. FI and FII have been characterized by infrared spectroscopy (IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission and ordinary powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) at different temperatures. The crystal structure of FII has been determined by single-crystal XRD. DSC and high-temperature PXRD have shown that both FI and FII will transform into a not previously reported hightemperature form (FIII) around 185 degrees C before this <b>form</b> <b>melts</b> at 200 - 202 degrees C. By indexing FIII PXRD data, a triclinic P (1) over bar cell was assigned to FIII. The solubility of quinizarin FI and FII in the pure organic solvents used in the present work is below 2. 5 % by weight and decreases in the order: toluene, acetone, acetic acid, acetonitrile and n-butanol. The crystal shapes obtained in different solvents range from thin rods to flat plates or very flat leaves, with no clear principal difference observed between FI and FII. Publishedpeer-reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Experiments {{conducted}} up to {{this time}} on glass <b>forming</b> <b>melts</b> in the low gravity environment of space show that glasses prepared in low-g are more chemically homogeneous and more resistant to crystallization than the comparable glasses prepared at 1 -g on Earth. This result is somewhat surprising and opposite to the accepted concept on glass formation for a melt. A hypothesis based on "shear thinning" of a melt, a decrease in viscosity with increasing shear stress, is proposed as {{an explanation for the}} observed low-gravity results. This paper describes detailed simulation procedures to test the role of thermal convection in introducing shear stress in glass <b>forming</b> <b>melts,</b> using a lithium disilcate melt as a model. The simulation system in its idealized version consists of a cylinder that is heated at one end and cooled at the other with gravity acting in a transverse direction to the thermal gradient. The side wall of the cylinder is assumed to be insulating. The governing equations of motion and energy are solved using variable properties for viscosity (Arrehenius and non-Arrehenius behaviors) and density (constant and temperature dependent). Other parametric variables in the calculations include gravity level and gravity vector orientation. The shear stress in the system are then computed as a function of gravity from the calculated values of maximum melt velocity, and its effect on melt viscosity (shear thinning) is predicted. Also included and discussed are the modeling efforts related to other potential convective processes in glass <b>forming</b> <b>melts</b> and their possible effects on melt viscosity...|$|R
