5|$|British {{secret service}} agent James Bond appears at the door asking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>room,</b> having had a flat tyre while passing. Bond quickly realises that Horror and Sluggsy are mobsters and that Viv is in danger. Pressuring the two men, he {{eventually}} gets the gangsters to agree to provide him a room. Bond tells Michel {{that he is in}} America in the wake of Operation Thunderball and was detailed to protect a Russian nuclear expert who defected to the West and who now lives in Toronto, as part of his quest to ferret out SPECTRE. That night Sluggsy and Horror set fire to the motel and attempt to kill Bond and Michel. A gun battle ensues and, during their escape, Horror and Sluggsy's car crashes into a lake. Bond and Michel retire to bed, but Sluggsy is still alive and makes a further attempt to kill them, before Bond shoots him.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century, {{the prison}} had {{separate}} areas for its {{two classes of}} prisoner: the master's side, which housed about 50rooms for rent, and the common or poor side, consisting of nine small rooms, or wards, into which 300people were confined from dusk until dawn. Room rents on the master's side were ten shillings a week in 1728, with most prisoners forced to share. John Baptist Grano paid 2s 6d (two shillings and six pennies) <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> with two beds on the master's side, shared with three other prisoners: Daniel Blunt, a tailor who owed £9, Benjamin Sandford, a lighterman from Bermondsey who owed £55, and a Mr. Blundell, a jeweller. Women prisoners who could pay the fees were housed in the women's quarters, known as the oak. The wives, daughters and lovers of male prisoners were allowed to live with them, if someone was paying their way.|$|E
5|$|Mac Sledge (Robert Duvall), a washed up, {{alcoholic}} country singer, awakens at {{a run-down}} Texas roadside motel and gas station {{after a night}} of heavy drinking. He meets the owner, a young widow named Rosa Lee (Tess Harper), and offers to work in exchange <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>room.</b> Rosa Lee, whose husband was killed in the Vietnam War, is raising her young son, Sonny (Allan Hubbard), on her own. She agrees to let Mac stay under the condition that he does not drink while working. The two begin to develop feelings for one another, mostly during quiet evenings sitting alone and sharing bits of their life stories.|$|E

25|$|The show ends on a {{high and}} in a similar style to how it all began. At Fiona's mansion {{boarding}} house, a young couple arrive, and ask <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>room.</b> The young woman is heavily pregnant. Fiona takes them in, {{just as she had}} with David and Patricia all those years ago. The woman gives birth to twins, {{a boy and a girl}} and the story seems to have finally come full circle. The final episode ends with a montage of many cast members, both past and present.|$|E
25|$|When Aelony {{arrived at}} the University of Minnesota, he met some of the few {{students}} of color and discovered {{that only a small}} number were from the local communities, since most local blacks chose to attend black colleges and universities in the South. He also found that other minority students were having trouble obtaining local housing and employment in Minneapolis. Aelony worked with a group of students to help find housing for Persian students. This population had difficulty securing housing because it was rumored that they rubbed their skin with olive oil, which ruined the bedding. If the minority students were told an apartment complex was full, white students would go ask <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> there to test the fairness of the renters. The students would then talk to the renters, who were often embarrassed and would agree to rent to the minority students.|$|E
25|$|Von Janowski {{showed up}} at the New Carlisle Hotel at 06:30 asking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> with a bath. The son of the hotel manager, Earle Annett Jr., noticed that the {{stranger}} seemed preoccupied and quickly noticed some inconsistencies in his story. The man said he took the bus that morning before walking to the hotel, but the bus was not going through New Carlisle that day, and even if it had, it would have dropped him off at the hotel. Annett also noticed that he spoke English with a Parisian accent, his clothing had European styling, and that he paid for his cigarettes with an obsolete Canadian dollar bill that had not been in circulation for quite some time. The stranger also had a strange smell on him; he was using Belgian matches that did not carry the Canadian government seal that was applied to matchbooks at the time. Less than three hours after his arrival and before Annett could confirm his suspicions, the stranger paid his bill and {{made his way to the}} train station where he had a coffee while waiting for the next train.|$|E

25|$|In 1981, Smith {{played the}} goddess Thetis in Clash of the Titans. For her role on {{television}} as Mrs Silly, she received {{the first of}} her four Best Actress BAFTA TV Award nominations. On stage, she won her third and fourth Evening Standard awards for Best actress, for Virginia in 1981 and The Way of the World in 1984. She won three more Best Actress BAFTA Awards for her roles as Joyce Chilvers in the 1984 black comedy A Private Function, Charlotte Bartlett in the 1986 Merchant Ivory production of A Room with a View and the title role in the 1987 film The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne. <b>For</b> <b>A</b> <b>Room</b> With a View, she also received her fifth Academy Award nomination and won her second Golden Globe Award. In 1987, she starred in A Bed Among the Lentils, part of Alan Bennett's Talking Heads series, receiving a second BAFTA TV nomination. She starred in the 1987 London production of Lettice and Lovage alongside Margaret Tyzack, receiving an Olivier Award nomination and reprised the role in 1990, when it transferred to Broadway and won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. The play was written specifically for her by the playwright Peter Shaffer.|$|E
500|$|Davidson, {{perhaps on}} the basis of his {{youthful}} Thames-side rescue, had convinced himself that nearly all young girls alone in London were in need of rescue from a life of vice. [...] Typical of these was Rose Ellis, whom he met in Leicester Square in September 1920. Twenty years old and living precariously from part-time prostitution, she was homeless and had no money. Davidson gave her cash <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>room,</b> and arranged to meet her the following week. Thus began a friendship that endured for more than a decade. Davidson brought her to the rectory, where she worked for a time in the gardens. He also tried to get her a job with a touring theatre company, took her to Paris to find employment as an au pair, kept her supplied with small sums of money, and paid her medical bills when she was suffering from venereal disease.|$|E
500|$|Smith had [...] "an intimacy" [...] {{with the}} level design tools such that he could sense when the design met the game's {{technical}} restrictions, like the maximum possible size or number of characters <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>room.</b> He suggested the narrower skill tree with palpable effects, such as exchanging skills about weapon damage for more accessible weapons. The team adopted the cuts, having been encouraged by the recent milestone. Spector has said that had {{they waited for the}} beta to have made the same reductions (as per common practice), [...] "it would have been a disaster." [...] Spector's post-proto-mission strategy was to bring the rest of the missions to proto-mission functionality rather than perfecting the two existing proto-missions. He felt {{that this would be a}} more efficient use of staff time, even if it meant that the final product would be more [...] "bare-bones" [...] than brilliant. Almost all of their game systems besides the inventory and conversation schemes were rethought up through the end of the project.|$|E

2500|$|Brownback {{supporters}} {{argued that}} the rooms rented out at C Street were not the equivalent of individual apartments with private bathrooms, kitchens, and living rooms. The lawmakers share communal space. Senator Tom Coburn's spokesman John Hart told The Hill: [...] "Anyone who has spent 10 minutes on Craigslist would realize that C Street residents pay fair-market value," [...] Hart said. [...] "Residents at the [...] boarding house have one bedroom. Most share a bathroom. All pay for their own meals and share personal space with the other residents and guests. They even share the remote … they fight over their favorite channel." [...] In addition, Hart stated that there are several Craigslist ads that demonstrate that $950 is fair market value <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> on Capitol Hill.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{abolition}} of serfdom in Russia in 1861, major cities experienced a large influx of former peasants who sought jobs as industrial workers in rapidly developing Russian industry. These people often lived in harsh conditions, sometimes renting a room, shared between several families. There also was {{a large number of}} shelterless homeless. Immediately after the October Revolution a special program of [...] "compression" [...] ("уплотнение") was enabled: people who had no shelter were settled in flats of those who had large (4, 5 or 6 room) flats with only one room left to previous owners. The flat was declared state property. This led to a large number of shared flats [...] where several families lived simultaneously. Nevertheless, the problem of complete homelessness was mostly solved as anybody could apply <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> or a place in dormitory (the number of shared flats steadily decreased after large-scale residential building program was implemented starting in the 1960s).|$|E
2500|$|Prettyman married Jennie McNames in June 1887, {{and the two}} {{operated}} a boarding house at 602 Lawrence Street in Ann Arbor that {{was known as the}} Campus Club, also known as Prettyman's Boarding House.

[...] Prettyman {{was a member of the}} Ann Arbor City Council from 1891 to 1895, president of the Ann Arbor Municipal League from 1892 to 1894, and a Washtenaw County supervisor starting in 1901. [...] Prettyman sold his boarding house to the University in 1914 and later became the principal owner and president of the Ann Arbor Press and the president of the White Swan Laundry and the Wolverine Power Company. [...] He was also Ann Arbor's postmaster for a time starting in 1906. [...] Prettyman died in March 1945 at age 87 at St. Joseph's Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbor.|$|E

2500|$|From Darwin's description, the Plinian [...] "consisted of {{students}} and met in an underground room in the university {{for the sake of}} reading papers on natural science and discussing them." [...] Activities also included excursions to the countryside around Edinburgh. Meetings appear to have been weekly, until at the society's request, Jameson put their case to the university <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> in his museum for their meetings and their own small [...] "museum", but the outcome was that the rent on their old room was raised and they eventually agreed to rent the Speculative Society's room for meetings on alternate Tuesdays. Papers presented by the students were often of high quality, inspired by their lecturers. Commonly, papers took the form of a critique of the work of established experts, together with the student's own thoughts. They covered a wide range of subjects including the circulation of ocean currents, identification of plants found in the nearby countryside, the anatomy of sea animals they had collected and principles of classification.|$|E
2500|$|Only {{a portion}} of Clementi's {{requests}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> change were permitted {{to be seen by}} the jury. After discussing with friends Ravi's first Twitter message ("saw my roommate making out with a dude"), Clementi, at 3:55a.m. on September 21, filed a request on the Rutgers housing website; he wrote, [...] "roommate used webcam to spy on me/want a single room." [...] The part about spying was ruled hearsay and not admissible. Late on the evening of September 21, after seeing Ravi's [...] "dare you" [...] tweet and just before his meeting with M.B., Clementi visited a resident assistant, Rahi Grover. [...] Grover was not permitted to testify about what Clementi said, but did testify about Clementi's demeanor. He said that Clementi's voice was [...] "a little shaky" [...] and that he appeared uncomfortable. The judge allowed some parts of Grover's official report of the incident: [...] "Tyler is quite upset and feels uncomfortable. Tyler prefers some sort of roommate switch ASAP and prefers some sort of punishment for Dharun Ravi." [...] Grover also included his own recommendation that a roommate change be made as soon as possible, and he offered Clementi a bed in his own room for that night, which Clementi declined.|$|E
2500|$|There were {{at least}} two occurrences of {{immediate}} censorship of the series.

[...] Wheeeooo! Okay." [...] The first airing of [...] "Hut Sut Raw" [...] included a scene in which Rocko is picking berries; upon picking one lower on the bush, a bear rushes out whimpering and grasping his crotch. This scene is untouched in Canada. Both scenes were edited by Nickelodeon after their first broadcasts and are the only instances of censorship on the season two DVD, released in 2012. On the season three DVD, the [...] "Wacky Delly" [...] segment was shortened by approximately ten seconds to remove footage of Sal Ami repeatedly whacking Betty Bologna over the head with a telephone receiver. In addition, the restaurant named [...] "Chokey Chicken" [...] (a term for masturbation) was renamed [...] "Chewy Chicken" [...] for the series' fourth season. As the series entered reruns after cancellation, more scenes were cut. The entire episode [...] "Leap Frogs", in which Bev Bighead attempts to seduce Rocko, was skipped.|$|E
