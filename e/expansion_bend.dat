We consider the kriged Kalman filter (KKF), a powerful modelling strategy which combines the two wellestablished approaches of (a) kriging, in the field of spatial statistics, and (b) the Kalman filter, in general state space formulations of multivariate time series analysis. We give a brief introduction to the model and describe its various properties, and highlight that the model allows prediction in time as well as in space, simultaneously. Some special cases of the time series model are considered. We give some procedures to implement the model, also illustrated through a practical example. The paper concludes with a discussion.

40|$|The {{success of}} stents to restore blood flow in {{atherosclerotic}} peripheral arteries is low relative to coronary arteries. It {{has been shown}} that joint flexion induces a mechanical environment that makes stent placement in these arteries highly incompatible, and damage and destruction of stents has been recorded. However, the effect of this environment on the stresses in the arteries is unknown. It is hypothesised that the stresses induced in arteries {{as a result of this}} mechanical environment could be sufficient to explain the relatively low success rates. To investigate this hypothesis, a finite element model of the stent-artery interaction was developed. Following stent <b>expansion,</b> <b>bending</b> was simulated by applying a displacement boundary condition to the artery. It is found that high stresses occur at the proximal/distal ends of the stent. As high stress and vascular injury are hypothesised to cause restenosis, the results presented here suggest that the mechanical environment of peripheral arteries could be the predominant cause of high restenosis rates...|$|R

40|$|A {{hot rolled}} strip {{produced}} by any integrated steel plant would require satisfying some stringent requirements of its surface profile. Crown and Flatness are two industrially accepted quantifiers {{that relate to the}} geometric tolerances in the rolled strips. This study attempts to regulate both crown and flatness within an acceptable limit, satisfying more than one objective at a time. Mathematically, this leads to a multi-objective optimization problem where the solution is no longer unique and a family of equally feasible solutions leads to the so called Pareto-Front, where each member is simply as good as the others. To implement this concept in the present context, one needs to realize that the surface deformation, which is ultimately imparted to the rolled sheets, comes from more than one source. The wear of the rolls, their thermal <b>expansion,</b> <b>bending,</b> and also deformation, contribute significantly towards the crown and flatness that is ultimately observed. During this study a detailed mathematical model has been worked out for this process incorporating all of these phenomena. Computation for the Pareto-optimality has been carried out using different forms of biologically inspired Genetic Algorithms, often integrated with an Ant Colony Optimization Scheme. Ultimately the model has been fine tuned for the hot rolling practice in a major integrated steel plant and tested against their actual operational data...|$|R
40|$|The tarsier skull {{has been}} of {{particular}} interest in studies of primate taxonomy and functional morphology for several decades. Despite this, there remains no comprehensive data on how the tarsier skull develops, especially {{in relation to the}} soft-tissues of the head. Here we have documented for the first time fetal development of the skull and brain as well as the nasal septum and eyes in T. bancanus. We have also tested for the possible influence of these tissues in shaping skull architecture. Nineteen post-mortem specimens were imaged using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance microscopy. Landmarks and volume data were collected and analysed. Findings demonstrated massive increases of brain size and eye size as well as flattening of the midline cranial base, facial projection and orbital margin frontation. Little evidence was found to support the notion that growth of the brain or nasal septum physically drives the observed changes of the skull. However, increases {{in the size of the}} eyes relative to skull size were associated with orbital margin frontation. With the possible exception of the results for eye size, the findings indicate that rather than forcing change the soft-tissues form a framework that physically constrains the morphogenetic template of the skeletal elements. This suggests, for example, that the degree of cranial base angulation seen in adulthood is not directly determined by brain <b>expansion</b> <b>bending</b> the basicranium, but by brain enlargement limiting the extent of cranial base flattening (retroflexion) in the fetus...|$|R

40|$|Photo-responsive {{liquid crystal}} {{polymers}} (LCP) which contain azobenzene moieties have gained interest {{for their ability}} to change properties by merely irradiating them with the correct wavelength of light in the appropriate temperature range. Furthermore, they have been crosslinked for elasticity and to translate this property change into photo-mechanical actuation, such as contraction, <b>expansion,</b> <b>bending,</b> or oscillation. However, a major drawback and hindrance to their actual use as actuators has been their need for elevated temperatures and their slow responses at room temperature. The work described in this thesis addresses this problem, and its solution has an impact on the field of functional elastomers in general. To produce a fast photo-response at room temperature, a new photo-responsive azobenzene nematic side chain (SC) LC polysiloxane was developed, characterized, and demonstrated to respond significantly, and reversibly from 0 - 50 °C, which is the ambient temperature range in which we live, through its photo-induced nematic to isotropic transition. In particular, its nematic phase almost totally disappeared in 35 s, and its modulus decreased up to 35 % in about 10 s. To turn this photo-response into photo-actuation, polystyrene (PS) end blocks were added to the poly(vinylmethylsiloxane) (PVMS) to produce PS-b-PVMS-b-PS, which is important in and of itself because the PVMS has a very low Tg and a functionalizable backbone and the PS end blocks make the material a thermoplastic elastomer. After attachment of the azobenzene LC, the resulting photo-responsive thermoplastic elastomer reversibly contracted 3. 3 % against 25. 7 kPa of stress in about 6 s. by Michael Thomas Petr.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2005 The {{prediction}} of head losses in a pipe system {{is very important}} because head losses affect the performance of fluid machinery such as pumps. In a pipe system, two kinds of losses are observed: major losses and minor losses. In Newtonian and non-Newtonian flow, major losses {{are those that are}} due to friction in straight pipes and minor losses are those that are due to pipe fittings such as contractions, <b>expansions,</b> <b>bends</b> and valves. Minor losses must be accurately predicted in a pipe system because they are not negligible and can sometimes outweigh major losses (Edwards et al., 1985). There is presently little data for the {{prediction of}} non-Newtonian head losses in pipe fittings in the literature and little consensus amongst researchers (Pienaar et al., 2004). In the case of diaphragm valves, usually, only one loss coefficient value is given in turbulent flow or in laminar flow with no reference to a specific size of the valve, assuming geometrical similarity that would lead to dynamic similarity. However, no one has done a systematic study of various sizes of diaphragm valves from the same manufacturer to establish if this is true. This could be the main reason for discrepancies found in the literature (Hooper, 1981; Perry & Chilton, 1973; Miller, 1978 and Pienaar et al., 2004). This work addresses this issue. A literature revIew on the flow of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids has been presented. The work of Hooper (1981) on diaphragm valves and the works of Edwards et al., (1985), BaneIjee et aI., (1994) and Turian et al., (1997) for non-Newtonian fluids in globe and gate valves were found to be relevant to this work...|$|R

Approach: Data were collected from documents and field study in the provinces of Sakon Nakhon, Nakhon Phanom, Mukdahan, Kalasin and Amnat Charoen by survey, observation, interview, focused group discussion and workshop. Results: The results of thesis were presented by means of Phu-thai people in northeast Thailand, their ancestors moved from the left bank of the Mekhong River. Most of them came from Mueang Bok and Mueang Wang towns. The model {{and structure of the}} pulpits are from beliefs in village pillar spirits in harmony with faith in Buddhism. The pulpits were constructed for use in performing religious affairs as the architectural symbol. They are single-pillar pulpits to be used in conventional and traditional festivals in each of the twelve lunar months. The current conditions and problems of single-pillar pulpit construction include must of the raw materials for pulpit construction are wood which is damage, lack of taking care of, wood diseases from mold and breaking, <b>expansion,</b> <b>bending,</b> lack of pulpit repairers and builders lacking transferring knowledge to next generation. The preaching hall shape has changed from wood to be high-shaped wood. For models of conservation and revitalization, all sectors must participate in conserving and revitalizing pulpits.

ST-SIZE was originally developed because NASA identified a need for accurate methods of formulating panel stiffness and thermal expansion coefficients, leading {{to the development of}} ST-SIZE from 1988 to 1995. Another need was the reduction of mass on high-speed aircraft and weight reduction for optimization. ST-SIZE was developed by a team of engineers working on the National Aerospace Plane X-30. Two major versions of ST-SIZE were created. The original version included formulations for stiffness terms and thermal expansion coefficients based on approximations often taken in traditional design methods. In 1990, a version of ST-SIZE was formed for structural design and weight prediction. A new method for formulation of stiffened panel properties was developed starting in 1991. A method for including composite lamina and laminate data in the formulation of stiffened panel structural properties was first developed. Thermal coefficients were created to handle both in-plane and through-the-thickness temperature gradients for membrane, bending, and membrane-bending coupling.
