Some praised Scherzinger's strong vocals and conviction to convey emotion, while others criticized {{her choice of}} allowing RedOne to produce {{the majority of the}} album, stating that some of the songs sounded too similar to each other. At times it was felt that Scherzinger lacked coherence across the record, often taking the sound that <b>individual</b> <b>producers</b> had created for her instead of showing originality. Critics compared many of the songs to those her fellow pop and R contemporaries Beyoncé and Rihanna. Scherzinger recorded new songs with R. Kelly, Snoop Dogg and Ne-Yo for the North American release of Killer Love; however, she confirmed that recording for her second studio album, originally scheduled for late 2013 release, had begun, signalling the end of the promotion for Killer Love.|$|E
500|$|There {{was some}} {{controversy}} concerning how many producers should receive an {{award from the}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for their work in producing the film. In 1999, the Academy decided that up {{to a maximum of}} three producers are eligible to be included in an award for a film. The rule was implemented to prevent a large number of involved filmmakers to appear on stage when a film was receiving an award. The Producers Guild of America (PGA) has not set a limit of producers that can be honored for a film. In the case of Little Miss Sunshine, there were five producers (Marc Turtletaub, Peter Saraf, Albert Berger, Ron Yerxa, and David Friendly) and the Academy did not want to include Berger and Yerxa. The two producers were responsible for finding the script, introducing the directors to the other producers, choosing the cinematographer, assisting in the re-shoot of the ending, and helping bring the film to the Sundance Film Festival. The Academy acknowledged that the two were partners in the production process, but declared that only <b>individual</b> <b>producers</b> are recognized by the Academy. Deeming the two producers' work as a collective effort, the Academy refused to consider either Berger or Yerxa for the award. Producer David Hoberman commented on the support for honoring all five producers, stating [...] "If there are five people actually involved in producing a movie, there's no reason why someone who's made a good enough film to be nominated for an Academy Award should be precluded from being rewarded for the work they did." [...] Lynda Obst who was affiliated with an Academy Award producer committee, also commented: [...] "By and large, five people don't make a movie. If this is an exception, then it's a sad situation. But you don't destroy a rule for an exception." ...|$|E

2500|$|There is {{widespread}} confusion because the fair trade industry standards provided by Fairtrade International (The Fairtrade Labelling Organization) {{use the word}} [...] "producer" [...] in many different senses, often in the same specification document.
