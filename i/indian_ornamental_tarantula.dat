At least nine species of endemic land snails such as the large Acavus superbus live in the forest.|$|R
50|$|Poecilotheria regalis is {{a species}} of {{arboreal}} tarantulas from the Western and Eastern Ghats, India. The common name for this spider is <b>Indian</b> <b>ornamental</b> tree spider, or simply <b>Indian</b> <b>ornamental.</b> It {{is one of the}} most popular arboreal tarantulas for amateur collectors. Their legspan sometimes exceeds 7 inches (18 cm).|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} a 19 -year-old boy with visible muscle spasms {{admitted}} to the hospitals 24 hours after spider bite. He was treated effectively with intravenous calcium gluconate followed by oral calcium supplements and made a full recovery 48 hours after the incident. Although no specific treatment exists in Srilanka, {{it has been suggested}} that calcium supplements may be beneficial to relieve the muscle spasms. Our patient made a full recovery with calcium supplements suggesting the treatment with calcium is beneficial in relieving the pain and muscle spasms caused by Sri-Lankan <b>Ornamental</b> <b>Tarantula</b> Poecilotheria fasciata...|$|R
500|$|Spiders {{make use}} {{of a variety of}} {{different}} threat displays. Some such as Argiope and Pholcus make themselves and their webs vibrate rapidly when they are disturbed; this blurs their outline and perhaps makes them look larger, as well as more difficult to locate precisely for an attack. Mygalomorphae spiders such as tarantulas exhibit deimatic behaviour; when threatened, the spider rears back with its front legs and pedipalps spread and fangs bared. Some species, such as the dangerous <b>Indian</b> <b>ornamental</b> tree spider (Poecilotheria regalis) have bright colouring on the front legs and mouthparts which are shown off in its threat display when it [...] "rears up on its hind legs, and brandishes the fore limbs and palpi in the air".|$|R
40|$|Literature on bird spider or {{tarantula}} bites (Theraphosidae) is rare. This {{is astonishing}} {{as they are}} coveted pets and interaction with their keepers (feeding, cleaning the terrarium or taking them out to hold) might increase the possibility for bites. Yet, {{this seems to be}} a rare event and might be why most theraphosids are considered to be harmless, even though the urticating hairs of many American species can cause disagreeable allergic reactions. We are describing a case of a verified bite by an <b>Indian</b> <b>ornamental</b> tree spider (Poecilotheria regalis), where the patient developed severe, long lasting muscle cramps several hours after the bite. We present a comprehensive review of the literature on bites of these beautiful spiders and conclude that a delayed onset of severe muscle cramps, lasting for days, is characteristic for Poecilotheria bites. We discuss Poecilotheria species as an exception from the general assumption that theraphosid bites are harmless to humans...|$|R
60|$|The large village, at {{the time}} of our visit, was gay with holiday dresses. It is {{surrounded}} by trees, chiefly of banyan, jack, mango, peepul, and tamarind: interminable rice-fields extend on all sides, and except bananas, slender betel-nut palms, and sometimes pawn, or betel-pepper, there is little other extensive cultivation. The rose-apple, orange, and pine-apple are rare, as are cocoa-nuts: there are few date or fan-palms, and only occasionally poor crops of castor-oil and sugar-cane. In the gardens I noticed jasmine, Justicia Adhatoda, Hibiscus, and others of the very commonest <b>Indian</b> <b>ornamental</b> plants; while for food were cultivated Chenopodium, yams, sweet potatos, and more rarely peas, beans, and gourds. Bamboos were planted round the little properties and smaller clusters of houses, in oblong squares, the ridge on which the plants grew being usually bounded by a shallow ditch. The species selected was not the most graceful of its family; the stems, or culms, being densely crowded, erect, as thick at the base as the arm, copiously branching, and very feathery throughout their whole length of sixty feet.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Costus speciosus (Koen ex. Retz.) Sm (Costaceae) is an <b>Indian</b> <b>ornamental</b> plant {{which has}} long been used medicinally in {{traditional}} systems of medicine. The plant {{has been found to}} possess diverse pharmacological activities. Rhizomes are used to treat pneumonia, rheumatism, dropsy, urinary diseases, jaundice, skin diseases and leaves are used to treat mental disorders. Method Antibacterial and antifungal activities were tested using Disc diffusion method and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC). Column chromatography was used to isolate compounds from hexane extract. X-ray crystallography technique and GC-MS analysis were used to identify the compounds Results Antibacterial and antifungal activities were observed in hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts. Hexane extract of C. speciosus showed good activity against tested fungi also. Two sesquiterpenoid compounds were isolated (costunolide and eremanthin) from the hexane extract. Both the compounds did not inhibit the growth of tested bacteria. But, both the compounds inhibited the tested fungi. The compound costunolide showed significant antifungal activity. The MIC values of costunolide were; 62. 5 μg/ml against Trichophyton mentagrophytes, 62. μg/ml against T. simii, 31. 25 μg/ml against T. rubrum 296, 62. 5 μg/ml against T. rubrum 57, 125 μg/ml against Epidermophyton floccosum, 250 μg/ml against Scopulariopsis sp, 250 μg/ml against Aspergillus niger, 125 μg/ml against Curvulari lunata, 250 μg/ml against Magnaporthe grisea. Conclusion Hexane extract showed promising antibacterial and antifungal activity. The isolated compound costunolide showed good antifungal activity. </p...|$|R
