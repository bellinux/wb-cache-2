25|$|Following the Westgate {{shooting}} in Nairobi by Al Shabaab operatives, the Ethiopian government halted {{its plans to}} withdraw completely out of Somalia. It instead indicated that it would continue to support the Somali armed forces and their AMISOM allies. In November 2013, the Ethiopian government {{announced that it would}} integrate its troops that are deployed in Somalia into the AMISOM multinational force. Somalia's Foreign Minister Fowzia Haji Yussuf welcomed the decision, stating that the move would galvanize AMISOM's campaign against the insurgent group. She also emphasized the importance of collaboration between Somalia and Ethiopia. The Ethiopian authorities' announcement came a month after a failed October bombing attempt by Al-Shabaab in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, and a week after Ethiopia received a renewed terrorism threat from the insurgent group. According to Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Ambassador Dina Mufti, the Ethiopian military's decision to join AMISOM is intended to render the peacekeeping operation more secure. Analysts also suggested that the move was primarily motivated by financial considerations, with the Ethiopian forces' operational costs now slated to be under AMISOM's allowance budget. It is believed that the Ethiopian military's long experience in Somali territory, its equipment such as helicopters, and the potential for closer coordination will help the allied forces advance their territorial gains. On the other hand, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> of unease following Ethiopia's entry into AMISOM given local animosity originating from Ethiopia's heavy handed intervention in 2006. There are also fears that Al Shabaab could use Somali animosity towards Ethiopia as a rallying cry and to recruit more members.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Tedros Adhanom {{announced}} that Ethiopian troops were {{pulling out of}} Baidoa as {{the situation on the}} ground was relatively stable and the Somali military and AMISOM forces were now able to assume security duties. The withdrawal was well planned and coordinated. Adhanom added that a pullout could have occurred twelve months earlier, but the allied forces were at the time unprepared to take over, so the move was postponed. Additionally, he asserted that Eritrea was attempting to destabilize Somalia and environs, and that the international community should take the situation seriously since Eritrea was also still allegedly supporting Al-Shabaab.

500|$|The work's realism {{attracted}} {{a large amount}} of commentary when it was first exhibited. Some saw it as an affront to Romanticism, others said that its small details not only showed an acute likeness, but built a psychological profile of the sitter. Art historian Geraldine Pelles sees Bertin as [...] "at once intense, suspicious, and aggressive". She notes that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> of projection of the artist's personality and recalls Théophile Silvestre's description of Ingres; [...] "There he was squarely seated in an armchair, motionless as an Egyptian god carved of granite, his hands stretched wide over parallel knees, his torso stiff, his head haughty". Some compared it to Balthasar Denner, a German realist painter influenced by Jan van Eyck. Denner, in the words of Ingres scholar Robert Rosenblum, [...] "specialised in recording every last line on the faces of aged men and women, and even reflections of windows in their eyes." [...] The comparison was made by Ingres' admirers and detractors alike. In 1833, Louis de Maynard of the Collège-lycée Ampère, writing in the influential L'Europe littéraire, dismissed Denner as a weak painter concerned with hyperrealistic [...] "curiosities", and said that both he and Ingres fell short of the [...] "sublime productions of Ingres' self-proclaimed hero, Raphael." ...|$|E

[...] In cases of more complex temples, a second axial passage is built, using the same trilithon construction, leading from the first set of apses into another later pair, and either a fifth central or a niche giving the four or five apsial form. In one case, at the Tarxien central temple, the fifth apse or niche is replaced by a further passage, leading to a final pair of apses, making six in all.

2500|$|The Motorola 6809 was {{originally}} produced in 1 MHz, 1.5MHz (68A09) and 2MHz (68B09) speed ratings. Faster versions were produced later by Hitachi. It is sometimes {{considered to be}} the conceptual precursor of the Motorola 68000 family of processors, though this is mostly a misunderstanding. The 6809 and 68000 design projects ran partly in parallel and have quite differing architectures as well as radically different implementation principles. However, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>amount</b> of design philosophy similarity (e.g., considerable orthogonality and flexible addressing modes), some assembly language syntax resemblance, as well as opcode mnemonic similarity, but the 6809 is a derivative of the 6800 whereas the 68000 was a totally new design. An 8-bit data bus version of the 68000 (i.e., the 68008) was intended for use in future 8-bit designs. With little to improve the 6809 marks the end of the evolution of Motorola's 8 bit processors.

2500|$|In The Lord of the Rings, Tom Bombadil is {{a mysterious}} {{character}} who aids Frodo {{and his companions}} on their journey. He and his wife Goldberry, the [...] "Daughter of the River", still live in their house on the Withywindle, {{and some of the}} characters and situations from the original poem appear in The Lord of the Rings.
