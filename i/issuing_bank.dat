25|$|The {{credit card}} may simply {{serve as a}} form of {{revolving}} credit, or it may become a complicated financial instrument with multiple balance segments each at a different interest rate, possibly with a single umbrella credit limit, or with separate credit limits applicable to the various balance segments. Usually this compartmentalization is the result of special incentive offers from the <b>issuing</b> <b>bank,</b> to encourage balance transfers from cards of other issuers. In the event that several interest rates apply to various balance segments, payment allocation is generally at the discretion of the <b>issuing</b> <b>bank,</b> and payments will therefore usually be allocated towards the lowest rate balances until paid in full before any money is paid towards higher rate balances. Interest rates can vary considerably from card to card, and the interest rate on a particular card may jump dramatically if the card user is late with a payment on that card or any other credit instrument, or even if the <b>issuing</b> <b>bank</b> decides to raise its revenue.|$|E
25|$|Discounting to face value: Before {{national}} currencies {{and efficient}} clearing houses, banknotes were only redeemable {{at face value}} at the <b>issuing</b> <b>bank.</b> Even a branch bank could discount notes of other branches of the same bank. The discounts usually increased with distance from the <b>issuing</b> <b>bank.</b> The discount also depended on the perceived safety of the bank. When banks failed the notes were usually partly redeemed out of reserves, but sometimes became worthless. The problem of discounting within a country does not exist with national currencies; however, under floating exchange rates currencies are valued relative {{to one another in}} the foreign exchange market.|$|E
25|$|Wear costs. Banknotes lose {{economic}} value by wear, since, {{even if they}} are in poor condition, they are still a legally valid claim on the <b>issuing</b> <b>bank.</b> However, banks of issue do have to pay the cost of replacing banknotes in poor condition and paper notes wear out much faster than coins.|$|E

25|$|Cost of acceptance. Coins can {{be checked}} for {{authenticity}} by weighing {{and other forms}} of examination and testing. These costs can be significant, but good quality coin design and manufacturing can help reduce these costs. Banknotes also have an acceptance cost, the costs of checking the banknote's security features and confirming acceptability of the <b>issuing</b> <b>bank.</b>|$|E
25|$|A credit card's {{grace period}} {{is the time}} the {{cardholder}} has to pay the balance before interest is assessed on the outstanding balance. Grace periods may vary, but usually range from 20 to 55 days {{depending on the type}} of credit card and the <b>issuing</b> <b>bank.</b> Some policies allow for reinstatement after certain conditions are met.|$|E
25|$|After the 2007-2009 {{financial}} crisis, regulators force {{banks to}} issue Contingent convertible bonds (CoCos).These are hybrid capital securities that absorb losses {{in accordance with}} their contractual terms when the capital of the <b>issuing</b> <b>bank</b> falls below a certain level. Then debt is reduced and bank capitalization gets a boost. Owing to their capacity to absorb losses, CoCos have the potential to satisfy regulatory capital requirement.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to rising}} {{inflation}} and easy credit, the Banca Romana {{and the five}} other <b>issue</b> <b>banks</b> (banks that were allowed to issue banknotes), had steadily increased their note circulation. In 1887 five of the <b>issue</b> <b>banks</b> had exceeded their legal limit, a fact well known {{to the government and}} banking and financial circles. However, restricting credit during a speculative construction boom was considered politically impossible.|$|R
25|$|The {{operator}} then {{asks the}} merchant {{a series of}} YES or NO questions {{to find out whether}} the merchant is suspicious of the card or the cardholder. The merchant may be asked to retain the card if it is safe to do so. The merchant may receive a reward for returning a confiscated card to the <b>issuing</b> <b>bank,</b> especially if an arrest is made.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the notes}} {{issued by the}} note-issuing banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland have to be backed by Bank of England notes held by the <b>issuing</b> <b>bank.</b> The {{combined}} size of these banknote issues is well over a billion pounds. To {{make it possible for}} the note-issuing banks to hold equivalent values in Bank of England notes, the Bank of England issues special notes with denominations of one million pounds ("Giants") and one hundred million pounds ("Titans") for internal use by the other banks.|$|E
25|$|When the Comoros {{became a}} {{separate}} French territory in 1945, {{the name of}} the <b>issuing</b> <b>bank</b> was changed to the Banque de Madagascar et des Comores (still headquartered in Paris). A branch office opened in Comoros in 1953. While the banknotes were changed to reflect the new status of Comoros, the coins were not changed and bore only the name Madagascar. On 26 December 1945, the Madagascar-Comores CFA franc was established and its value was fixed at 1.7 French francs. Old Madagascar coins and banknotes continued to circulate as this new currency. On 17 October 1948, the CFA franc was revalued to 2 French francs.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} the Discover Card was introduced, Sears was the largest {{retailer}} in the United States. It had purchased the Dean Witter Reynolds brokerage organization and Coldwell, Banker & Company (real estate) in 1981 {{as an attempt to}} add financial services to its portfolio of customer services. Ray Kennedy, Sr, father of country singer Ray Kennedy and the credit manager for Sears, conceived the card. Together with the Discover Card (and its <b>issuing</b> <b>bank,</b> the Greenwood Trust Company, owned by Sears), this was named the Sears Financial Network. Early Discover Cards bore a small embossed symbol representing the Sears Tower, then the company's headquarters.|$|E
25|$|For merchants, {{a credit}} card {{transaction}} is often more secure than other forms of payment, such as cheques, because the <b>issuing</b> <b>bank</b> commits to pay the merchant the moment the transaction is authorized, {{regardless of whether the}} consumer defaults on the credit card payment (except for legitimate disputes, which are discussed below, and can result in charges back to the merchant). In most cases, cards are even more secure than cash, because they discourage theft by the merchant's employees and reduce the amount of cash on the premises. Finally, credit cards reduce the back office expense of processing checks/cash and transporting them to the bank.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{a central}} bank or {{treasury}} is solely responsible within a state or currency union for the issue of banknotes. However, {{this is not always}} the case, and historically the paper currency of countries was often handled entirely by private banks. Thus, many different banks or institutions may have issued banknotes in a given country. Commercial banks in the United States had legally issued banknotes before there was a national currency; however, these became subject to government authorization from 1863 to 1932. In the last of these series, the <b>issuing</b> <b>bank</b> would stamp its name and promise to pay, along with the signatures of its president and cashier on a preprinted note. By this time, the notes were standardized in appearance and not too different from Federal Reserve Notes.|$|E

500|$|The National Bank Act (...) {{authorized}} {{the issue of}} a national currency. Historical vignettes on the front and back were the same by denomination (e.g., Landing of Columbus was on the reverse of all $5 notes) and the state coat of arms (located on the reverse left side) was coordinated with the geographic location of the <b>issuing</b> <b>bank.</b> Records do not clearly state who bore the responsibility for the design of the state arms (i.e., the U.S. Treasury Department, or the three bank note companies contracted for engraving and printing). It appears that the first dies (for New Jersey, Missouri, Minnesota, and Vermont) were completed by the American Bank Note Company by 9 October 1863 based on their own drawings. State arms appeared on the reverse of the Original and 1875 Series notes (first and second issue of the first design), and the 1882 Brown Back Series (the second design) of National Bank Notes.|$|E
