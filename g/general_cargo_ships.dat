500|$|There {{are various}} ways {{to define the}} term bulk carrier. As of 1999, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea defines a bulk carrier as [...] "a ship {{constructed}} with a single deck, top side tanks and hopper side tanks in cargo spaces and intended to primarily carry dry cargo in bulk; an ore carrier; or a combination carrier." [...] However, most classification societies use a broader definition where a bulker is any ship that carries dry unpackaged goods. Multipurpose cargo ships can carry bulk cargo, but can also carry other cargoes and are not specifically designed for bulk carriage. The term [...] "dry bulk carrier" [...] is used to distinguish bulkers from bulk liquid carriers such as oil, chemical, or liquefied petroleum gas carriers. [...] Very small bulkers are almost indistinguishable from <b>general</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>ships,</b> and they are often classified based more on the ship's use than its design.|$|E
