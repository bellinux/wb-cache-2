The study was first performed on six snail species together and then specifically on Cepaea sp. and Oxychilus draparnaudi. When the six species were considered together, the accumulation of metals depended mostly on the species. When significant, total or extractable metal concentrations, or the predicted free <b>ion</b> <b>activities,</b> accounted for less than 7 % of the variation of the metal concentrations in the snail tissues. Species-specific analyses showed that extractable concentrations explained approximately 25 % of the variation of the metal concentrations in O. draparnaudi, and up to 8 % in Cepaea snails. When using total soil concentrations and soil properties as explanatory variables, the models were generally slightly better, explaining up to 42 % of the variance.

Empirically based models, or transfer functions, published to date differ {{with respect to the}} mathematical model used, the optimization method, the methods used to determine metal concentrations in the solid and solution phases and the soil properties accounted for.
