Tucker made his way to his nearby place of work and asked a co-worker to check on his wife.

500|$|Shanina's {{personal}} life was thwarted by war. On 10 October 1944, {{she wrote in}} her diary, [...] "I can't accept that Misha Panarin doesn't live anymore. What a good guy! [...] has been killed... He loved me, I know, and I him... My heart is heavy, I'm twenty, but I have no close [...] friend". In November 1944, Shanina wrote that she [...] "is flogging <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> that [...] loves" [...] a man named Nikolai, although he [...] "doesn't shine in upbringing and education". In the same entry she wrote {{that she did not}} think about marriage because [...] "it's not the time now". She later wrote that she [...] "had it out" [...] with Nikolai and [...] "wrote him a note in the sense of 'but I'm given to the one and will love no other one". Ultimately in her last diary record, filled with sombre tones, Shanina wrote that she [...] "cannot find a solace" [...] now and is [...] "of no use to anyone".|$|E
500|$|When Jam and Lewis {{agreed to}} produce Jackson's third studio album, {{they wanted to}} appeal {{primarily}} to the African American community, in addition to achieving crossover success on the pop music charts. Jam commented {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone magazine, [...] "We wanted to do an album that would be in every black home in America... we were going for the black album of all time." [...] Before their association with Jackson, Jam and Lewis had originally planned to record an album with tracks they wrote for Sharon Bryant, but she found their lyrics and sound to be too [...] "rambunctious". The duo presented the same set of recordings to Jackson, who gave her input and took co-writing and co-production credits for the album's content. Jam and Lewis recalled that in order to collaborate with Jackson on the material, they spent the first week simply getting to know their new client. Lewis explained, [...] "We got <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> We saw what she was capable of, what she wanted to say, where she wanted to be, what she wanted to be. We put together some songs to fit her as we saw her, as she revealed herself to us. It was as simple as that." ...|$|E

500|$|Drury {{commanded}} Neptune for {{the next}} two years, until his promotion to rear-admiral in 1804. He departed the ship on 13 May 1804, and the following day Captain Sir Thomas Williams took over. Neptune spent the rest of 1804 deployed with the Channel Fleet, blockading the French Atlantic ports. During this time Captain Williams' health progressively worsened, and he was invalided back to Britain on 7 May 1805. He was replaced by Captain Thomas Fremantle on 8 May, and was sent to join Robert Calder's force blockading Ferrol, after the Franco-Spanish fleet had arrived there after the Battle of Cape Finisterre. Calder decided that his eight ships were not sufficient to resist Villeneuve's fleet were it to come out of harbour, and instead went north to join Admiral William Cornwallis's fleet off Brest. Shortly afterwards Nelson's fleet returned from the West Indies, bringing 12 more ships, and Calder was given 18 ships, including Neptune, and sent back to Ferrol to search for Villeneuve. By now Villeneuve had put into Cadiz and Calder's force was ordered to join the hastily assembled British fleet under Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood, that was blockading the Franco-Spanish fleet at Cadiz. As the British fleet settled in for a long blockade Fremantle commented on Neptunes sailing qualities. She had the reputation of being slow, and Fremantle complained that he did not like being in 'a large ship that don't sail and must continually be late in action.' During the battle however, Midshipman William Baddock commented that 'The old Neptune, which never was a good sailer, took it <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> that morning to sail better than I ever remember to have seen her do before.' Neptune [...] went into the battle 18 men short of her complement.|$|E
2500|$|During 2010, an {{official}} inquest into the medical support surrounding Dragun {{at the time}} of her death was held by the Coroner's Court in Glebe, New South Wales, a suburb of Sydney.

60|$|She was {{recovering}} herself now. A certain icy aloofness {{seemed to have}} crept <b>into</b> <b>her</b> manner. <b>Her</b> <b>head</b> was held at a different angle. Even the words seemed to leave her lips differently. Her tone was one of measured indignation.|$|R
60|$|It {{was about}} two o'clock before she {{actually}} began to sit, and even then she was no statue.

60|$|Miss Heath, as Mrs. Brownlow had guessed, thought an engaged girl {{as bad as}} {{a barrel}} of gunpowder, and was quite as much afraid of Miss Allen putting {{nonsense}} <b>into</b> <b>her</b> pupils' <b>heads</b> as the doctor could be of the reverse process: so, young teachers not being scarce, Carey's brief connection with Miss Heath was brought {{to an end in}} a morning call, whence she returned endowed with thirteen book-markers, five mats, and a sachet.|$|R
