5|$|After the {{surrender}} of General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, {{the primary reason for}} manned defenses protecting Washington ceased to exist. Initial recommendations by Col.

Fort Corcoran fell into the third-class category.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test whether {{environmental}} enrichment alters the status and responsiveness of pituitary-adrenocortical and sympathetic-adrenomedullary hormones in rats. Previous studies have shown that rats <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> enriched environment differ from those <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> standard cages in dendritic branching, synaptogenesis, memory function, emotionality and behaviour. In male Wistar rats <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> enriched environment for 40 days, we studied basal concentrations of hormones, endocrine responses to 5 -HT 1 A challenge and responsiveness and adaptation to repeated handling. Environmental enrichment consisted of large plexiglass cages with 10 rats per cage, which contained variety of objects exchanged three times <b>a</b> week. Rats <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> this enriched environment had higher resting plasma concentrations of corticosterone, larger adrenals and increased corticosterone release to buspirone challenge compared to controls. Lower adrenocorticotropic hormone, corticosterone and adrenaline responses to handling were noticed <b>in</b> rats <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> enriched environment. Exposure to repeated handling led to a more rapid extinction of corticosterone responses <b>in</b> rats <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> enriched environment. Thus, environmental enrichment leads to pronounced changes in neuroendocrine regulation, including larger adrenals and increased adrenocortical function, which are so far considered to be indication of chronic stress...|$|R

The church was torn down, though it is uncertain when and by whom, but the cross was preserved by the people of the region. They believed that it could protect against evil and ensure a rich harvest, and kept it as sacred, although they had converted to Islam. The cross was later taken from them by the neighboring clan of Mrkojevići. As they too converted to Islam, they entrusted the cross to the Andrović family—their Orthodox Christian neighbors. The Mrkojevići considered it more appropriate for the cross to be <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Christian home, rather than in a Muslim one.|$|E
