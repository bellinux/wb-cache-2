Caribou skin {{is ideal}} for cold, dry weather as each hair has a <b>honeycomb</b> <b>core</b> that traps air, which is an {{excellent}} insulator. Sealskins and caribou skins were always kept separate and not combined in the same garment except for occasional decorative strips. Yup’ik dance fans decorated with caribou throat hair, caribou leg-skins were made into high boots, sleeping bags for travel made by joining two caribou skins and fur-side-out fancy parkas. Historically, caribou were hunted {{in the fall and}} skins were brought home for skin clothing. Caribou hunts were discouraged by the Russian and American traders as they felt it took the trappers away from their trap lines. Prior to European contact, caribou were important not only for their meat but for the skins which were an important item used in clothing. The Russians encouraged the Eskimos to adopt Western-style dress in order to release more furs for trading. In the spring, some people hunted caribou along the inland river ways.|$|E

An interlocking method was developed for both kinds of three-dimensional <b>honeycombs.</b> Euler or <b>core</b> shear macro-buckling, face wrinkling, face inter-cell buckling, core member crushing and face sheet crushing were considered and theoretical relationships for predicting the failure load associated with each mode were presented.

2500|$|Snowboards are {{generally}} constructed of a hardwood core which is sandwiched between {{multiple layers of}} fibreglass. Some snowboards incorporate the use of more exotic materials such as carbon fiber, Kevlar, aluminium (as a <b>honeycomb</b> <b>core</b> structure), and have incorporated piezo dampers. The front (or [...] "nose") of the board is upturned to help the board glide over uneven snow. The back (or [...] "tail") of the board is also upturned to enable backwards (or [...] "switch") riding. The base (the side of the board which contacts the ground) is made of Polyethylene plastic. [...] The two major types of base construction are extruded and sintered. [...] An extruded base is a basic, low-maintenance design which basically consists of the plastic base material melted into its form. [...] A sintered base uses the same material as an extruded base, but first grinds the material into a powder, then, using heat and pressure, molds the material into its desired form. [...] A sintered base is generally softer than its extruded counterpart, but has a porous structure which enables it to absorb wax. [...] This wax absorption (along with a properly done 'hot wax'), greatly reduces surface friction between the base and the snow, allowing the snowboard to travel on {{a thin layer of}} water. Snowboards with sintered bases are much faster, but require semi-regular maintenance and are easier to damage. The bottom edges of the snowboard are fitted with a thin strip of steel, just a couple of millimeters wide. [...] This steel edge allows the board to grab or 'dig into' hard snow and ice (like the blade of an ice skate), and also protects the boards internal structure. [...] The top of the board is typically a layer of acrylic with some form of graphic designed to attract attention, showcase artwork, or serve the purpose similar to that of any other form of printed media. Flite Snowboards, an early designer, pressed the first closed-molded boards from a garage in Newport, Rhode Island, in the mid-1980s. Snowboard topsheet graphics can be a highly personal statement and many riders spend many hours customizing the look of their boards. The top of some boards may even include thin inlays with other materials, and some are made entirely of epoxy-impregnated wood. [...] The base of the board may also feature graphics, often designed in a manner to make the board's manufacturer recognizable in photos.|$|E

40|$|Hexagonal <b>honeycomb</b> <b>cores</b> {{have found}} {{extensive}} applications {{particularly in the}} aerospace and naval industries. In view of the recent interest in novel strong and lightweight <b>core</b> architectures, square <b>honeycomb</b> <b>cores</b> were manufactured and tested under uniform lateral compression. A slotting technique {{has been used to}} manufacture the square <b>honeycomb</b> <b>cores</b> based on three different materials; glass fibre-reinforced plastic (GFRP), carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) and self-reinforced polypropylene (SRPP). As semi-rigid polyvinyl chloride (PVC) foam was placed in each of unit cells to further stiffen the core structure. The core then was bonded to two skins to form a sandwich structure. The compressive responses of the sandwich structures were measured as a function of relative density. In this paper, particular focus is placed on examining the compression strength and energy absorption characteristics of the square honeycombs with and without the additional foam core. Comparisons in terms of specific strength and specific energy absorption have shown that the CFRP core offers excellent properties. The presence of the foam core significantly increases the energy absorption capability of overall structure and the SRPP core could potentially be used as an alternative lightweight core material in recyclable sandwich structures. ...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to their}} high {{specific}} strength and high specific stiffness properties {{the use of}} honeycomb panels is particularly attractive in spacecraft structures. However, the dynamic loads produced during the launch of a satellite can subject the <b>honeycomb</b> <b>cores</b> of these sandwich structures to numerous stress cycles, potentially leading to early fatigue failures. Knowledge of the fatigue behavior of these <b>honeycomb</b> <b>cores</b> is thus a key requirement when considering their use in spacecraft structural applications. This paper presents the findings of an experimental test campaign carried out to investigate the static and fatigue behaviors of aluminum hexagonal <b>honeycomb</b> <b>cores</b> subject to in-plane shear loads. The investigation involved carrying out both static and fatigue tests using the single block shear test method. These tests were conducted for both of the two principal cell orientations (L and W) and from the results S-N fatigue curves for both cell orientations are presented, confronted and discussed. These results are also discussed {{in relation to the}} observed damage and failure modes which have been reported for the statically tested specimens and for the fatigue tested specimens at various stages of fatigue life.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study is to develop tools {{dedicated}} to the design of sandwich panels involving Nomex <b>honeycomb</b> <b>cores.</b> Special attention is paid to the ability to perform full three dimensional calculations up to failure of such structures. In the first part, the determination of effective elastic properties of Nomex <b>honeycomb</b> <b>cores</b> is carried out thanks to strain based periodic homogenization technique. Using an equivalence in energy between a real honeycomb and a fictitious continuous medium, it becomes possible to evaluate the elastic behavior of Nomex cores, starting from the knowledge of the behavior of the constitutive paper. Next, relying on experimental observations, the strengths of Nomex <b>honeycomb</b> <b>cores</b> are evaluated with a linear Euler’s buckling analysis. Results are compared with data coming from manufacturers, and give satisfaction. In order to carry out these two first studies, the Nida Core software has been developed using the finite element code Cast 3 M from CEA.
