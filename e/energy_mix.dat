The Board decided in 1977 that construction of the final three units would commence in 1979 with the target of commissioning in 1985/6, as part of meeting load growth with an adjusted mix policy aiming for a balance of coal, nuclear, and oil. However later that year in July, the Government requested that Drax Completion proceed immediately, ahead of requirements, in order to secure jobs in the North East's heavy manufacturing industries. The Board agreed to this subject to being compensated.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{share of}} {{renewable}} energy sources (RES) production in <b>energy</b> <b>mixes,</b> especially the ones of PV panels and wind farms, has been continuously increasing {{during the last few}} years.
