Brown had been under <b>intense</b> <b>pressure</b> from human rights campaigners {{to send a message to}} China, concerning the 2008 Tibetan unrest. His decision not to attend the opening ceremony was not an act of protest; the decision was made several weeks in advance of the Games.|$|E
5|$|Carbon is {{the fourth}} most {{abundant}} chemical element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon is abundant in the Sun, stars, comets, and in the atmospheres of most planets. Some meteorites contain microscopic diamonds that were formed when the solar system was still a protoplanetary disk. Microscopic diamonds may also be formed by the <b>intense</b> <b>pressure</b> and high temperature at the sites of meteorite impacts.|$|E
5|$|In December 1917 the Bolsheviks {{were under}} <b>intense</b> <b>pressure</b> from the Germans to {{conclude}} peace negotiations at Brest-Litovsk, and Russia Bolshevism was in crisis, with a demoralized {{army and the}} fate of the October Revolution in doubt. Lenin calculated that the Bolsheviks could hold central parts of Russia but had to give up some peripheral territories, including Finland in the geopolitically less important north-western corner. As a result, Svinhufvud and his senate delegation won Lenin's concession of sovereignty on 31 December 1917.|$|E

Julia's daughter, Victoria Elizabeth, born in the Elmswood Nursing Home on 19June 1945, was {{subsequently}} given up for adoption to a Norwegian Salvation Army Captain and his wife (Peder and Margaret Pedersen) after <b>intense</b> <b>pressure</b> from the Stanley family. John Lennon was informed by his Aunt Harriet of her existence in 1964. John was so overcome by emotion, wanting to find his sister, that he placed an ad in the paper, and hired detectives to look for her. They searched Norway for Victoria, and came up empty handed, and John died never having found or knowing her.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of the show, the staff was forced by the Fox network into doing clip shows to save money. There was {{originally}} <b>intense</b> <b>pressure</b> on the producers of the show to create extra episodes in each season, and the plan was to make four clip shows per season to meet that limit. Writers and producers, however, felt that this many clip shows would alienate fans of the series. The Fox network's reasoning was that clip shows cost half of what a normal episode costs to produce, but they could sell syndication rights at full price.|$|E
5|$|In January 1837, Smith {{and other}} church leaders created a joint stock company, called the Kirtland Safety Society, {{to act as}} a quasi-bank; the company issued bank notes {{capitalized}} in part by real estate. Smith encouraged the Latter Day Saints to buy the notes, and he invested heavily in them himself, but the bank failed within a month. As a result, the Latter Day Saints in Kirtland suffered <b>intense</b> <b>pressure</b> from debt collectors and severe price volatility. Smith was held responsible for the failure, and there were widespread defections from the church, including many of Smith's closest advisers. After a warrant was issued for Smith's arrest on a charge of banking fraud, Smith and Rigdon fled Kirtland for Missouri in January 1838.|$|E

5|$|Sources {{from the}} 19th and early 20th centuries {{indicate}} that the angelshark was once abundant all around the coasts of Western Europe. Yarrell (1836), Day (1880–04), and Garstang (1903) all noted that the angelshark was common around the British Isles, and Rey (1928) recorded that this species was common around the Iberian Peninsula and in the Mediterranean. However, from {{the latter half of}} the 20th century onwards, the angelshark has come under <b>intense</b> <b>pressure</b> from commercial fisheries operating across much of its range. Due to its benthic, near-shore habits, individuals of all ages are susceptible to incidental capture by bottom trawls, trammel nets, and bottom longlines; the low reproductive rate of this shark limits its capacity to withstand population depletion.|$|E
5|$|The bombing {{caused a}} major outcry {{throughout}} the world, and the Irish and British governments introduced new legislation {{in an attempt}} to destroy the organisation. The RIRA also came under pressure from the Provisional IRA, when Provisional IRA members visited the homes of 60 people connected with the RIRA and ordered them to disband and stop interfering with Provisional IRA arms dumps. With the organisation under <b>intense</b> <b>pressure,</b> which included McKevitt and Sands-McKevitt being forced from their home after the media named McKevitt in connection with the bombing, the RIRA called a ceasefire on 8 September.|$|E
5|$|The second {{development}} was that President Habyarimana {{announced that he}} was introducing multi-party politics into the country, following <b>intense</b> <b>pressure</b> from the international community, including his most loyal ally France. Habyarimana had originally promised this in mid-1990, and a number of opposition groups had formed in the months since, including the Republican Democratic Movement (MDR), Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the Liberal Party (PL), but the one-party state law had remained in place. In mid-1991, Habyarimana officially allowed multi-party politics to begin, a change which saw a plethora of additional new parties come into existence. Many had manifestos which favoured full democracy and rapprochement with the RPF, but in reality were quite ineffective and had no political influence. The older opposition groups registered themselves as official parties, and the country was notionally moving towards a multi-party inclusive cabinet with proper representation, but progress was continually hampered by the regime. The last opposition party to form was the Coalition for the Defence of the Republic (CDR), which was more hardline Hutu than Habyarimana's own party and had close links to the akazu.|$|E

5|$|When Sorceress Edea {{becomes the}} Galbadian ambassador, Balamb and Galbadia Gardens order Squall's team to assassinate her; Irvine is {{introduced}} as the sniper for the mission. Moments before the assassination attempt, he explains to Squall {{that he always}} chokes under pressure. In spite of his nerves and under <b>intense</b> <b>pressure,</b> he fires an accurate shot, but Edea uses magic to stop the bullet. At Trabia Garden, Irvine reveals that he {{and most of the}} other party members had lived in the same orphanage, run by Cid and Edea Kramer. However, the others could not remember this because of their use of Guardian Forces (GF), magical beings who cause severe long-term memory loss as a side effect. Because Irvine had not used a GF until he joined the party, he is able to remember his past. During the game, Irvine gradually draws closer to Selphie, acting on the feeling he has had since living with her at the orphanage.|$|E
5|$|When the North American Plate on its slow journey westwards {{encountered}} the Pacific Plate approximately 250 {{million years ago}} during the Paleozoic, the latter began to subduct under the North American continent. <b>Intense</b> <b>pressure</b> underground caused some of the Pacific Plate to melt, and the resulting upwelling magma pushed up and hardened into the granite batholith that makes up much of the Sierra Nevada. Extensive layers of marine sedimentary rock that originally made up the ancient Pacific seabed were also pushed up by the rising granite, and the ancestral Merced River formed on this layer of rock. Over millions of years, the Merced cut a deep canyon through the softer sedimentary rock, eventually hitting the hard granite beneath. The encounter with this resilient rock layer caused the Merced River to mostly stop its downcutting, although tributary streams continued to widen the ancient canyon.|$|E
5|$|Celtic {{reached the}} European Cup final again in 1970. Celtic knocked out Basel {{in the first}} round, then {{defeated}} Portuguese side Benfica 3–0 at Parkhead in {{the first leg of}} the second round. Celtic's performance was impressive, and they were unfortunate not to score more. Benfica rallied in the return match and put Celtic under <b>intense</b> <b>pressure</b> from the start. John Fallon was outstanding in goal for Celtic and with the game nearing its end had limited the score to 2–0 for the Portuguese side. Diamantino, however, scored direct from a free-kick in the final minute to level the tie on aggregate and force extra-time. No further goals were scored in the additional 30 minutes, and the tie was decided by the toss of a coin. Captain Billy McNeill successfully called, and Celtic progressed to the quarter-finals. Celtic were unhappy that the tie had been decided in this manner, and suggested to UEFA an alternative of using a scoreline {{based on the number of}} corners forced in extra-time. UEFA rejected this proposal, but soon afterwards introduced penalty kick shoot-outs in the European Cup to decide drawn ties after extra-time. Celtic went on to face Italian champions Fiorentina in the quarter-finals, winning 3–1 on aggregate.|$|E

5|$|In 1917, Russia {{had been}} in {{political}} turmoil with {{support for the war}} and the Tsar dwindling. Under <b>intense</b> <b>pressure</b> Tsar Nicholas II abdicated in March and a provisional government formed under Alexander Kerensky, pledging to continue fighting the Germans on the Eastern Front. The Western allies had been shipping supplies to Russia {{since the beginning of the}} war, through the ports of Archangel, Murmansk and Vladivostok. Following the entry of the United States into World War I in 1917, the Americans also began providing support. Political and social unrest increased however, with the revolutionary Bolsheviks gaining widespread support. During the July Offensive, the Russian Army was soundly defeated by the German and Austro-Hungarians, leading to the collapse of the Eastern Front. The Russian Army was on the verge of mutiny and most soldiers had deserted the front lines. Kerensky's government was overthrown in October 1917, and the Bolsheviks assumed power. The Russian Civil War began in the wake of the collapse of the provisional government. The principal fighting occurred between the Bolshevik Red Army and the forces of the White Army, being a group of loosely allied anti-Bolshevik forces. During the war a number of foreign armies also took part, mostly fighting against the Red Army, while many foreign volunteers also fought for both sides. Other nationalist and regional political groups also participated in the war, including the Ukrainian nationalist Green Army, the Ukrainian anarchist Black Army and Black Guards, and warlords such as Ungern von Sternberg.|$|E
5|$|The {{controversial}} 1905 {{partition of}} Bengal had a widespread political impact. Acting as a stimulus for radical nationalist opinion in India and abroad, {{it became a}} focal issue for Indian revolutionaries. Revolutionary organisations like Jugantar and Anushilan Samiti had emerged in the 20th century. Several significant events took place. These included assassinations and attempted assassinations of civil servants, prominent public figures and Indian informants, including one in 1907 aiming to kill the Bengal Lieutenant-Governor Sir Andrew Fraser. Matters {{came to a head}} when the 1912 Delhi–Lahore Conspiracy, led by erstwhile Jugantar member Rash Behari Bose, attempted to assassinate the then Viceroy of India, Charles Hardinge. In the aftermath of this event, the British Indian police made concentrated police and intelligence efforts to destroy the Bengali and Punjabi revolutionary underground. Though the movement came under <b>intense</b> <b>pressure</b> for some time, Rash Behari successfully evaded capture for nearly three years. By the time World War I had begun in Europe in 1914, the revolutionary movement had revived in Punjab and Bengal. In Bengal the movement, with a safe haven in the French base of Chandernagore, had sufficient strength to all but paralyse the state administration. The earliest mention of a conspiracy for armed revolution in India appears in Nixon's Report on Revolutionary Organisation, which reported that Jatin Mukherjee (Bagha Jatin) and Naren Bhattacharya had met the Crown Prince of Germany during the latter's visit to Calcutta in 1912, and obtained an assurance that they would receive supplies of arms and ammunition. At the same time an increasingly strong pan-Islamic movement started developing, mainly in the north and north-west regions of India. With the onset of the war in 1914, the members of this movement formed {{an important component of the}} conspiracy.|$|E
