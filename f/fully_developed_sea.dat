The model properly accounts for hydrodynamic proximity effects and structural coupling between the bodies. A standard second order model is used, for demonstration purposes, {{in order to}} model the frequency response properties of the connecting body. Parametric studies of the response amplitude operator of the ramp motion are performed for varying wave directions and isolator stiffness and damping.

40|$|A {{model for}} the {{wavenumber}} spectrum for <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> <b>seas</b> is derived {{as a function of}} the mean wind gradient. The high wavenumber part of the spectrum, which defines the Bragg wavenumbers, is an equilibrium spectrum in balance by a wind forcing term determined by viscous dissipation, which is a strong function of water temperature, and dissipation by breaking and microbreaking. The low wavenumber spectrum, constructed from surface elevation observations of gravity waves, is merged with the high wavenumber spectrum. Parameters are adjusted to fit circle flight data for Ku-band. The full spectrum is used in the two-scale Bragg scattering theory, plus specular reflection, to compute backscatter as a function of wind speed, direction, incidence angle, and water temperature (which determines viscosity) for Ku-band...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the second}} {{in a series of}} {{training}} modules on marine wind and waves. The first module discussed wave types and characteristics and is a good primer to this next marine training topic. Wave Life Cycle I: Generation examines how wind creates waves and the inter-relationships between wind speed, wind duration, and fetch length during this process. These three factors are important to predicting wave height and what will limit wave growth. Additional topics include <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> <b>seas,</b> observation sources, and various special wind events such as coastal jets and instability mixing in the marine boundary layer. While much of this instruction is at a basic level, all marine forecasters will find benefit in the more intermediate and advanced topics. These include the issue of dynamic or trapped fetch as well as the use of satellite-based observations of marine winds using the active microwave technique known as scatterometry. User interactions are included throughout the module and within the short case study. The next module in the series will look at propagation and dispersion as the waves leave the generation area.

The measurement site was the Chesapeake light tower situated in the north Atlantic Ocean, 15 km {{off the coast of}} Virginia Beach, Virginia. The radar was placed on a platform 26 m above mean sea level. Measurements were made at grazing angles between 3 and 10 deg. A nearly uninterrupted record of ocean current velocity was obtained for a 26 -day period. The measurement dependence on various system and hydrodynamic parameters and a comparison with an independent in-situ current measurement (EM current meter) are presented. Experimental results show that the Delta K spectrum with a distinguishable resonant line can be measured under all weather conditions, from calm seas with large swells to the <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> <b>seas</b> occurring under winds as high as 20 ms- 1. The only parameter that needs to be adjusted in real time is the frequency separation, Delta f, which has to be modified according to the varying shape of the ocean wave spectrum.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyze the {{vertical}} plane response of surface ships in close proximity towing. The problem is formulated by using the heave and pitch equations of motion in regular waves. The vertical motion of the leading and trailing ship attachment points is calculated. The relative motion between these points is then matched through a notional spring/damper model of the connection. This allows calculation of the complete response amplitude operators for the two ships {{in terms of their}} relative motion and connection force. Parametric studies are conducted in terms of connection spring and damper characteristics, speed, and sea direction.

For the locally <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> <b>sea,</b> the spectral peak period Tpf {{is a function of}} the significant wave height, Hs, Tpf=af*Hs 1 / 3 with af slightly dependent on fetch. This classifies sea states as wind sea TpTpf each consisting of two wave systems.

40|$|It is {{proposed}} that the sea surface roughness zo can be predicted from the height and steepness of the waves, zo/Hs = A(Hs/Lp) B, where Hs and Lp are the significant wave height and peak wavelength for the combined sea and swell spectrum; best estimates for the coefficients are A = 1200, B = 4. 5. The proposed formula is shown to predict well the magnitude and behavior of the drag coefficient as observed in wave tanks, lakes, and the open ocean, thus reconciling observations that previously had appeared disparate. Indeed, the formula suggests that changes in roughness due to limited duration or fetch are of order 10 % or less. Thus all deep water, pure windseas, regardless of fetch or duration, extract momentum from the air at a rate similar to that predicted for a <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> <b>sea.</b> This is confirmed using published field data {{for a wide range}} of conditions over lakes and coastal seas. Only for field data corresponding to extremely young waves (U 10 /cp > 3) were there appreciable differences between the predicted and observed roughness values, the latter being larger on average. Significant changes in roughness may be caused by shoaling or by swell. A large increase in roughness is predicted for shoaling waves if the depth is less than about 0. 2 Lp. The presence of swell in the open ocean acts, on average, to significantly decrease the effective wave steepness and hence the mean roughness compared to that for a pure windsea. Thus the predicted open ocean roughness is, at most wind speeds, significantly less than is observed for pure wind waves on lakes. Only at high wind speeds, such that the windsea dominates the swell, do the mean open ocean values reach those for a <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> <b>sea...</b>|$|E
40|$|Wave-breaking {{dissipation}} {{is one of}} {{the least}} understood processes implemented in contemporary wave models. Significant effort has been put in its parameterization, but it has not proven to be totally satisfactory, either theoretically or practically. In this work, theWAVEWATCH III (version 2. 22; Tolman) wave model is used to evaluate the two wind input/dissipation source term packages that it includes: (i) Wave Model(WAM) cycle 3 (WAMDIG) and (ii) Tolman and Chalikov. Global model outputs were obtained under the same wind forcing for the two dissipation formulations and were collocated in space and time in the north Indian Ocean with Ocean Topography Experiment (TOPEX) altimeter data. The performance of the model was assessed by evaluating the statistical behavior of the collocated datasets. The parameters examined were significant wave height, wind speed, wind direction, wave direction, wave height for <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> <b>seas,</b> and energy loss due to wave breaking. From the results, the behavior of the input/dissipation formulations in specific wind and wave conditions was identified; that is, the results give insight to the way the two source term packages ‘‘work’’ and how they respond to local wind sea or swell. Specifically, both of the packages were unable to perform adequately during a season when the area can be mostly affected by swell. However, the results confirmed that the examination of only integral spectral wave parameters does not give information on the inherent physical characteristics of the formulations. Further study, on the basis of point spectra, is necessary to examine the formulations’ performance across the wave spectrum...|$|R

40|$|Ocean {{gravity waves}} have been {{recorded}} near Melkbosstrand with a Wemelsfelder float type wave recorder on a sea tower situated in water 13 m deep and one Kilometre offshore. The half hour records, taken twice daily between July 1972 - June 1973, have been analysed in a format uniform with that of Draper (1966). Measurements have been made from the wave records to check {{the value of the}} statistical ratios of Longuet- Higgins (1952) and Draper (1963). Ratios of maximum wave height to root mean square amplitude are lower than the theoretical values and reasons for this are discussed {{in the light of the}} records being taken in shallow water. Ratios of maximum wave height to the average upper one tenth wave height and average upper one third wave height agree closely with the theoretical values. Spectral analysis using the methods of Blackman and Tukey (1958), with 36 degrees of freedom and 100 lags have been applied to half hour records digitized once per second. Frequency, time diagrams contoured at equal energy values have been constructed for the period May and part of June 1973 on the basis of twice daily spectral measurements at 5 mHz intervals. The wave events, which include generation of swell from near South Georgia, (54 °S, 37 °W), have been compared with the South African Weather Bureau synoptic charts in order to identify generation centres. Repeated energy values near the 50 mHz band seem to be generated by winds of a lower velocity than required by Moskowitz (1964). Predominant siting of fetches at distances of the order of 1000 nautical miles accounts for the bulk of wave generation between latitudes 40 ° - 50 °S.

Assuming such a situation, we seek a self-consistent solution for the wind stress {{in the sense that}} the wind stress entering the models of sea spectrum and wind-induced growth rate is constrained to be equal to the wind stress obtained through integration of form drag over the wavenumber space. Using the models by Donelan and Pierson (1987) for both <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> <b>sea</b> spectrum and short-scale wind-induced wave growth rate, we find self-consistent, firmly constrained solutions with roughness lengths in good agreement with Charnock's formulation (amely, z 0 proportional to u* 2), with a constant of proportionality which is of a magnitude very close to experimental values reported in the literature. Thus it appears that there is consistency between our knowledge of the surface stress, wind input, and spectral shape.

In the present study, a numerical investigation is performed to study breaking irregular waves in deep water. The irregular waves are generated using the Torsethaugen spectrum which is a double-peaked spectrum defined for a locally <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> <b>sea.</b> The Torsethaugen spectrum takes both the sea and swell waves into account.
