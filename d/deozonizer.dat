40|$|Differential Resonant Absorption Ultra-Violet Spectroscopy (DUV-RAS) based analyzers have {{potential}} to replace chemiluminescent analyzers in Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems (CEMS). Due to the demanding analytical requirements and the advantages {{offered by the}} DUV-RAS analyzers, this new approach provides superior emission data at lower costs. Advantages include low noise, no water and carbon dioxide interference, less equipment for operation, and reduced costs. Although the chemiluminescent analyzer offers the benefit of wide measuring ranges down to low concentrations with a fast response time, its drawbacks are characterized by quenching effects caused by carbon dioxide and water, by an adverse cost-benefit ratio, {{by the fact that}} ozone, a highly toxic gas is required and by additional components needed, such as vacuum pumps and <b>deozonizer.</b> As the levels of NOx are becoming lower and lower in todayâ€™s Continuous Emission Monitoring (CEM) market, users are looking for better alternatives for the measurement of NOx in stack emissions. A discussion of conventional Non Dispersive UV (NDUV) is given to show the difference between DUV-RAS and NDUV analyzers. A comparison of NOx measurements by a DUV-RAS based analyzer operating parallel to a chemiluminescent device is also given. A discussion of the data is presented. In addition, the specifications of the DUV-RAS analyzer are discussed...|$|E
