Constructed in 1936, this Spanish Colonial Revival building was designed by architects of the Eastern Division, Branch of Plans and Design from the National Park Service. The well-detailed building has a simplified Spanish Baroque doorway framed by pilasters topped with frieze, cornice and finials flanking a second story window. The window has rusticated moldings at its sides and is in turn capped with a broken arched pediment. Windows {{on the first floor}} are screened by wrought iron grilles. On the second story there are five-light French doors that open on to wrought iron balconies. The hip roof is covered with clay tile. The air-conditioning system was replaced in 1960. The first floor was remodelled in 1966 to accommodate a lobby and an audio-visual room. Steps up to the front door were enlarged in 1965 and the <b>hand</b> <b>railing</b> may have been put in at that time. The building remains in use as the administrative core of the park.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Examples of {{the need}} for {{nondestructive}} and remote sensing technologies for evaluating early stages of decay are presented. The need is critical to develop methods of analyzing internal decay, at the center of large wood members, and decay behind concealing coverings. Current technologies are reviewed and their inadequacies discussed. Acoustic emission and acoustoultrasonics appear to hold the greatest promise among existing technologies. Sometimes, nondestructive evaluation (NDE) is not needed to determine that a potentially serious decay problem exists in a building. If the plywood siding, a <b>hand</b> <b>railing,</b> or a major glulam beam sprouts mushrooms (fig. 1), for example, you can be pretty sure you have a decay problem on your hands. Unfortunately, those are rare occurrences. White mycelium growing on the surface of wooden structural members in moist areas (fig. 2) is also a pretty good clue that you should be concerned about the structural integrity of the member involved, but that, too, occurs relatively infrequently in structures. Once the structure is opened and advanced Figure 2 [...] Mycelial mat on joist and underside of plywood subfloor. decay is revealed, little additional information is necessary to assess the structural impact of the decay in many cases. But, in the majority of cases of wooden structures with water problems, visual indicators are not present and some form of internal assessment must be incorporated.

Researches from developed and developing countries found that there were problems affecting the inclusive education in Nigeria. Hence, there is need to determine the challenges facing the schools where inclusive education is being implemented, and what could be done to improve the programme. This study identified the facilities that were available to students with special educational needs in mainstreamed public secondary schools in Southwestern Nigeria; it investigated the difference in the attitude of special and regular teachers to students with special educational needs in integrated public secondary schools; it determined the influence of types of exceptionality in the self-perception of students with special needs; and also examined the difference between the academic performance of male and female students with special educational needs. The results showed that essential facilities and materials like <b>hand</b> <b>railings,</b> hearing aids, Braille, instructional materials, and lower toilets were not available, although the few that were available (typewriters, resource rooms, wheel chairs) were in poor condition.

40|$|Shipping, {{fishing and}} {{exploration}} activities in Arctic waters are endangered by ice accretion on critical structures causing various safety risks. Ulmatec Pyro {{have developed an}} anti-icing/de-icing system using waste heat circulation in a double pipe system, for <b>hand</b> <b>railings,</b> helicopter decks and stairway applications. The research objectives of this master thesis was to support Ulmatec Pyro in the design process, using theoretical models for design optimization, and to develop experimental facilities to verify their designs to meet the IMO Polar Code for ships operating in Arctic areas. The {{first part of the}} project investigated relevant literature and research on icing mechanisms and de-icing technologies. Atmospheric icing is a known problem for mobile units such as airplanes. However, marine icing is more complex since it involves saline water. Further, the marine icing process is more unpredictable with a periodic behavior caused by the weather conditions. Two different numerical models are developed, based on previous icing studies and combined with basic thermo- and fluid- dynamics. First, a simple 1 -dimensional steady state anti-icing model was developed using finite difference method (FDM) and lumped capacitance method (LCM). This model programmed in MATLAB code, is made for a given symmetrical double pipe geometry, and shows good correlations with experimental tests. The second model is made in COMSOL Multiphysics, where 2 -dimensional axisymmetric geometry is used. This model is able to handle transient as well as steady state conditions. The purpose of this model was to simulate de-icing processes. Comparing the steady state results, the CFD model and the simple 1 D model shows good correlations. The transient de-icing simulations results give good results within the assumptions that the water is entrapped in the ice. However, the de-icing experiments show that this model must be modified to give more realistic ice-melting behavior. These modifications include water draining giving insulation air layers between ice and pipe surface, and further include saline ice models. An experimental setup was designed and built for validating theoretical models, and further as a design verification lab for Ulmatec Pyro. The test lab was built inside a commercial freezing container, which turned out to have insufficient freezing capacity for the extreme Polar test conditions. Despite of these limitations, a series of experiments were conducted, providing valuable insight in the icing- and anti-icing processes. The experiments also showed that double pipes gave a more uniform surface temperature than a single pipe, and that it is favorable with a higher flow velocity in the annulus between the inner and outer pipe. The experiments confirm that the double pipe technology is giving a more uniform surface temperature along the pipe compared to a single pipe. Hence, a more efficient use of waterborne heat. The experiments also provided good validation of the theoretical simulation models within the available test conditions. De-icing tests also showed the complexity of the ice melting process. Hence, it gave {{a better understanding of the}} de-icing process and that more complex simulation models are needed. The experiments also provided valuable experience and information needed to upgrade the test rig for further testing with more extreme Polar conditions...|$|R
