5|$|The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are {{standards}} and interpretations {{developed by the}} <b>International</b> <b>Accounting</b> <b>Standards</b> Board, which are principle-based. IFRS are used by over 115 countries or areas including the European Union, Australia, and Hong Kong. The United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting, is largely rule-based. Critics have stated that the rules-based GAAP is {{partly responsible for the}} number of scandals that the United States has suffered. The principles-based approach to monitoring requires more professional judgment than the rules-based approach.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{stakeholders}} {{in many countries}} such as The United States who report several concerns in the usage of rules-based accounting. According to recent studies, many believe that the principles-based approach in financial reporting would not only improve but would also support an auditor upon dealing with client’s pressure. As a result, financial reports could be viewed with fairness and transparency. When the U.S. switched to <b>International</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>standards,</b> they are composed that this would bring change. However, as a new chairperson of the SEC takes over the system, the transition brings a stronger review about {{the pros and cons}} of rules- based accounting. While the move towards international standards progresses, there are small amount of research that examines the effect of principle- based standards in an auditor’s decision- making process. According to 114 auditing experts, most are willing to allow clients to manage their net income based on rules- based standards. These results offers insight to the SEC, IASB and FASB in weighing the arguments in the debate of principles- vs. rules based- accounting.|$|E

Further examples of international regulatory bodies are: the Financial Stability Board (FSB) established to coordinate information and activities among developed countries; the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) which coordinates the regulation of financial securities; the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) which promotes consistent insurance industry supervision; the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering which facilitates collaboration in battling money laundering and terrorism financing; and the <b>International</b> <b>Accounting</b> <b>Standards</b> Board (IASB) which publishes accounting and auditing standards. Public and private arrangements exist to assist and guide countries struggling with sovereign debt payments, such as the Paris Club and London Club. National securities commissions and independent financial regulators maintain oversight of their industries' foreign exchange market activities. Two examples of supranational financial regulators in Europe are the European Banking Authority (EBA) which identifies systemic risks and institutional weaknesses and may overrule national regulators, and the European Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee (ESFRC) which reviews financial regulatory issues and publishes policy recommendations.|$|E

50|$|In {{financial}} accounting, a {{cash flow}} statement, {{also known as}} statement of cash flows, is a financial statement that shows how changes in balance sheet accounts and income affect cash and cash equivalents, and breaks the analysis down to operating, investing and financing activities.

The statement captures both the current operating results and the accompanying changes in the balance sheet.

40|$|Purpose - This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} power in the <b>international</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>standard</b> setting process for the extractive industries and explains how that process was mobilised by key extractive industries constituents. For many years these constituents, highly significant in the global economy, have enjoyed choice in the application of <b>accounting</b> <b>standards,</b> enabling them flexibility in the way they present their operations. This investigation illuminates {{the way in which they}} have influenced the process of setting an International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) for the extractive industries. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology is based on a critical approach to accounting research, termed critical investigative inquiry. This methodology focuses on the political, economic, and social influences on accounting and facilitates the questioning of taken for granted assumptions and power relations involved in <b>accounting</b> and <b>accounting</b> <b>standard</b> setting. The research method that is used to conduct these inquiries is based on Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA). CDA is used to identify the key players involved in the <b>international</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>standard</b> setting process for the extractive industries, and to analyse their discourse and its implications. The outcomes of the <b>international</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>standard</b> setting process are then explained using power/capture theory, which was developed for this research as an integration of Lukes 2 ̆ 7 (1974) conception of power and Mitnick 2 ̆ 7 s (1980) theory of regulatory capture. Lukes 2 ̆ 7 (1974) theory recognises that power need not be empirically verifiable to exist and that the status quo may need to be questioned in order for the presence of power to be illuminated. Mitnick 2 ̆ 7 s (1980) theory explains regulatory processes and identifies the factors that contribute to a predisposition of regulatory bodies to take actions consistent with the preferences of the industry they were intended to regulate. Power/capture theory, in combination with CDA, provides a framework to make possible the exposure of these factors and recognises that the presence of power/capture may be insidious and the result of a relationship formed between the regulatory body and the regulated industry. Findings - The IASC/IASB 2 ̆ 7 s extractive industries project, commenced in 1998, resulted in the issue in December 2004 of IFRS 6, Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Assets. This IFRS is simply a codification of existing industry practice, resulting in a perpetuation of the disparate accounting and financial reporting endemic to the extractive industries. This has occurred because of the mobilisation of a powerful community of interests within the extractive industries, which has enabled them to capture the IASC/IASB in order to maintain status quo of flexibility in accounting and financial reporting. Research contributions - The contributions of this research are three-fold. First, as a critical methodology and research method, critical investigative inquiry and CDA have the potential not only to uncover the social practice and public discourse of <b>accounting</b> <b>standard</b> setting, but also to expose the discourse practice underlying the process and make visible the presence of power. Secondly, the theory of power/capture developed to explain the <b>international</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>standard</b> setting process is an innovative approach developed from two theories which are themselves relatively absent from extant accounting literature. Further, CDA and power/capture theory are complementary, and may be used together as a comprehensive framework for critical examination of the <b>accounting</b> <b>standard</b> setting process. Thirdly, this research provides a contribution to practical knowledge of <b>international</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>standard</b> setting processes by tracing the history of accounting for the extractive industries, identifying key players involved in the process, and making connections between these players to provide confirmatory evidence of the effect {{of power in the}} <b>international</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>standard</b> setting process. Research limitations/future research - Because this research is based on publicly available information and identification of key players based on lobbying activity, it relies on overt behaviour that may occur relatively late in the process of setting the <b>accounting</b> <b>standard,</b> compared to agenda setting and committee formation. Further studies may overcome this limitation by examining <b>international</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>standard</b> setting from inside the process, by means of participant observation. The CDA and power/capture framework developed in this thesis can be applied to other studies of <b>international</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>standard</b> setting projects or to studies of other aspects of the extractive industries project...|$|R
