50|$|Heat traps {{are very}} simple and inexpensive. They are an {{effective}} way to prevent cooling of hot water in water heaters by thermosyphoning the hot water to a higher elevated portion of the piping system. Thermosyphoning is based on natural convection. Hot water rises and is then displaced by cold water beneath it. The <b>heat</b> <b>trap</b> stops this process, thus keeping the hot water inside the insulated storage tank.|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: Photovoltaic {{solar cell}} {{generate}} electric by receiving sun light or solar irradiance. But solar cell received heat from solar irradiance {{as well and}} this will reduced {{the efficiency of the}} solar cell. The <b>heat</b> <b>trap</b> at the solar photovoltaic panel become waste energy. Approach: The solution for this was by adding a cooling system to the photovoltaic panel. The {{purpose of this study was}} to cool the solar cell in order to increase its electrical efficiency and also to produce heat energy in the form of hot air. Hot air can be used for drying applications. A single pass PVT with rectangle tunnel absorber has been developed. The rectangle tunnel acted as an absorber and was located at the back side of a standard photovoltaic panel. The dimension of the photovoltaic panel was 120 × 53 cm. The size of the rectangle tunnel was 27 units of tunnel bar with the size of 1. 2 × 2. 5 × 120 cm (width×tall×length) and 12 units with 1. 2 × 2. 5 × 105. 3 cm (width×tall×length). The rectangle tunnel was connected in parallel. The PVT collector has been tested using a solar simulator. Results: Electrical efficiency increased when the solar cell was cool by air flow. Solar photovoltaic thermal collector with rectangle tunnel absorber has better electrical and thermal efficiency compared to solar collector without rectangle tunnel absorber.

The conversion of naptha to high octane aromatics requires high energy to initiate and sustain the reaction at temperatures of 850 - 950 oF. Hydrogen - rich off - gases are fired in combinations of process furnaces. Heat is transferred to hydrocarbon fluids by radiation, principally. Feed or return stream temperatures determine the need for convection sections. It is essential that the operation and maintenance of these furnaces be optimized to minimize production costs. This paper describes the performance testing and evaluation of a set of ten refinery furnaces used to thermally drive several reforming reactors and to regenerate catalysts. Firing rates provide an input of 216. 2 x 106 Btu/hr. to the furnaces, at $ 1. 90 per 106 Btu. The units are fitted with multiple natural draft burners. There is insufficient turbulence and swirl in the burners. Operators manually set up the burners with excessive airflows for normal, full-load firing. These furnaces represent production limits. Products of combustion exhaust at high thermal levels - the range is from 985 - 1700 oF. The mixed gases flow through a "waste heat" boiler, or they bypass the boiler and enter a single stack. Steam generation at 150 psig averages 38, 200 lb/hr. Heat is wasted via the bypass at a rate of 41. 1 x 106 Btu /hr. at 1240 oF. When airflows are reduced (to 15 % excess air) the loss will be 18. 7 x 106 Btu/hr. at 1180 oF. Installation of a second, parallel waste heat boiler will result in a saving of l 3. 4 x 106 Btu/hr. Energy savings at this furnace complex will be equivalent to $ 628, 700 per year. Investment costs were estimated to be less than $ 250, 000 for the proposed <b>heat</b> <b>trap</b> addition...|$|E

50|$|Global warming {{potential}} (GWP) is {{a relative}} measure of how much heat a greenhouse gas traps in the atmosphere. It compares the amount of <b>heat</b> <b>trapped</b> by a certain mass of the gas in question {{to the amount of}} <b>heat</b> <b>trapped</b> by a similar mass of carbon dioxide. A GWP is calculated over a specific time interval, commonly 20, 100, or 500 years. GWP is expressed as a factor of carbon dioxide (whose GWP is standardized to 1). In the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, methane has a lifetime of 12.4 years and with climate-carbon feedbacks a global warming potential of 86 over 20 years and 34 over 100 years in response to emissions. User related choices such as the time horizon can greatly affect the numerical values obtained for carbon dioxide equivalents. For a change in time horizon from 20 to 100 years, the GWP for methane decreases by a factor of approximately 2.5.The substances subject to restrictions under the Kyoto protocol either are rapidly increasing their concentrations in Earth's atmosphere or have a large GWP.|$|R

50|$|Studies of {{earthshine}} {{can be used}} to {{show how}} the Earth's cloud cover varies over time. Preliminary results show a 6.5% dip in cloud cover between 1985 and 1997 and a corresponding increase between 1997 and 2003. This has implications for climate research, especially with regards to global warming. All clouds contribute to an increased albedo, however some clouds have a net warming effect because they <b>trap</b> more <b>heat</b> than they reflect, while others have a net cooling effect because their increased albedo reflects more radiation than they <b>trap</b> <b>heat.</b> So while the Earth's albedo is measurably increasing, the uncertainty over the amount of <b>heat</b> <b>trapped</b> means the overall effect on global temperature remains unclear.|$|R

2500|$|The report itself {{stated that}} [...] "While {{the rate at}} which surface-air {{temperatures}} are rising has slowed in recent years, heat continues to be trapped in the Earth system, mostly as increased ocean heat content.

50|$|Cirrus cloud {{thinning}} is {{a proposed}} form of climate engineering. Cirrus clouds are high cold ice that, like other clouds, both reflect sunlight and absorb warming infrared radiation. However, they differ from {{other types of}} clouds in that, on average, infrared absorption outweighs sunlight reflection, resulting in a net warming effect on the climate. Therefore, thinning or removing these clouds would reduce their <b>heat</b> <b>trapping</b> capacity, resulting in a cooling effect on Earth's climate.

Cirrus cloud thinning is an alternative category of climate engineering, in addition to solar radiation management and greenhouse gas removal.|$|R
