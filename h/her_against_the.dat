5|$|Tri Sviatitelia was {{captured}} when the Germans took {{the city in}} May 1918 and {{was turned over to}} the Allies after the Armistice in November 1918. Her engines were destroyed in 1919 by the British when they withdrew from Sevastopol to prevent the advancing Bolsheviks from using <b>her</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> White Russians. She was abandoned when the Whites evacuated the Crimea in 1920 and was scrapped in 1923.|$|E
5|$|Tri Sviatitelia was {{refitting}} in Sevastopol {{during the}} February Revolution of 1917. Immobile, she {{was captured by}} the Germans in Sevastopol in May 1918 and {{handed over to the}} Allies in December 1918 after the Armistice. The British wrecked her engines on 24 April 1919 when they left the Crimea to prevent the advancing Bolsheviks from using <b>her</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> White Russians. The ship was captured by both sides during the Russian Civil War, but was abandoned by the White Russians when they evacuated the Crimea in November 1920. Tri Sviatitelia was scrapped in 1923, although she was not stricken from the Navy List until 21 November 1925.|$|E
5|$|Victoria's {{household}} {{was largely}} run by her childhood governess, Baroness Louise Lehzen from Hanover. Lehzen {{had been a}} formative influence on Victoria, and had supported <b>her</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Kensington System. Albert, however, thought Lehzen was incompetent, and that her mismanagement threatened his daughter's health. After a furious row between Victoria and Albert over the issue, Lehzen was pensioned off in 1842, and Victoria's close relationship with her ended.|$|E

5|$|Pankhurst {{was spared}} further {{force-feeding}} attempts after this incident, but {{she continued to}} violate the law and – when imprisoned – starve herself in protest. During the following two years she was arrested numerous times but was frequently released after several days because of her ill-health. Later, the Asquith government enacted the Cat and Mouse Act, which allowed similar releases for other suffragettes facing ill-health due to hunger strikes. Prison officials recognised the potential public relations disaster that would erupt if the popular WSPU leader were force-fed or allowed to suffer extensively in jail. Still, police officers arrested her during talks and as she marched. She tried to evade police harassment by wearing disguises and eventually the WSPU established a jujutsu-trained female bodyguard squad to physically protect <b>her</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> police. She and other escorts were targeted by police, resulting in violent scuffles as officers tried to detain Pankhurst.|$|E
5|$|Raynor {{returns in}} , having earned {{the trust of}} the Protoss and befriended the templar warrior Fenix. The Raiders and Fenix's forces remain on Aiur as a rearguard while the {{surviving}} Protoss evacuate their homeworld, now devastated and overrun by the Zerg, for the dark templar world of Shakuras. Raynor is later contacted by Kerrigan, who convinces them to join with <b>her</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> United Earth Directorate (UED), which has arrived to pacify the sector by any means necessary. Raynor and Fenix reluctantly prevent Mengsk's capture by the UED, and with Kerrigan's Zerg rout the UED from the Dominion throne world of Korhal. However, Kerrigan turns on her allies, launching a surprise attack against both the Dominion and the Raiders. Although the Hyperion escapes the planet, Fenix is killed in the attack; an outraged Raynor vows that Kerrigan will die by his hands.|$|E
5|$|This is {{followed}} with Spears performing a dance routine inside a blacklight paint graffiti room, {{and the two}} women dancing around a metal bedframe. Spears then begins chasing Madonna in a wooden-like maze, and the latter enters a room covered with fallen leaves and stands in a swing. Once Spears finds the room, Madonna {{is nowhere to be}} found. Throughout the video, Madonna gradually loses her symbolic power, paralleled by her disposing the cane and jacket, becoming less phallic and more noticeably female biologically and more feminine socially. Although it ultimately seems that Spears becomes the dominant figure, Madonna recovers her phallic power {{in the form of a}} cigar from an onlooking male. Spears appears in Madonna's room and throws <b>her</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall, and Madonna vanishes just as they are about to kiss. The video ends as Madonna's laugh is heard in the background.|$|E

5|$|With the Halliwells' help, Billie {{attempts}} to help Christy reintegrate back into {{everyday life and}} to gain control over her powers. Billie and the Halliwells are unaware of Christy's collaboration with the Triad. The Triad identifies Billie as the Ultimate Power, which was foreshadowed in earlier episodes as the season's big bad, and refers to Christy {{as the key to}} unlocking Billie's power. The Triad arranges for Christy's parents to be killed by a pair of Noxon demons (John Rosenfeld and David S. Lee), believing prolonged contact with them could sway her morality to the side of good. Billie becomes angry by the Halliwell sisters when they decide to interrogate the demons to gather more information about the Ultimate Power rather than killing them to avenge her parents' deaths. Christy uses Billie's feeling of betrayal to turn <b>her</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Charmed Ones. Billie and Christy vanquish the Noxon demons, who were previously believed to be invincible, and the Halliwell sisters realize that Billie is the Ultimate Power.|$|E

He was tried before Mr. Justice Swift, charged with Mona's abduction; {{the taking of}} the girl by fraud {{with the intent of}} depriving her father of possession of her; of detaining her by fraud; of decoying and enticing her into his possession; and of unlawfully stealing and carrying away the child and secreting <b>her</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wishes of her father.|$|E

25|$|During {{her career}} Lunenburg went through three {{significant}} refits. The first took place {{after she was}} assigned to duties associated with Operation Torch in 1942. Upon arrival in the United Kingdom, she was given added AA armaments to protect <b>her</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> increased chance of aerial bombardment. Her second major refit began in March 1943 at Liverpool, Nova Scotia and was completed on 17 August 1943. During this refit her fo'c'sle was extended. Her third and final significant refit began in the Fall of 1944 at Saint John and was completed at Halifax mid-January 1945.|$|E
25|$|Dover was at Madras Roads on 1 May 1811 {{undergoing}} a refit when a major gale struck. She was at anchor, with topmasts struck and foreyard lowered. Tucker had gone ashore {{and so she}} was {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Charles Jeffries. Although Jeffries dropped a second anchor and later a bower anchor after her anchor cable parted, a sudden squall drove her into the northeast corner of Fort Saint George during the night of 2 May. Despite attempts to save her, the storm battered <b>her</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> fort's walls until she foundered. Two men drowned.|$|E
25|$|During her Presidency, Tilghman was {{embroiled in}} a court case pitting <b>her</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> family of a major donor to the university, the Robertsons. The {{children}} of the original donors, who were themselves Princeton alums, alleged that the University failed to apply the funds donated by their parents to the intended purpose, and asked for the funds to be restored to the family for use elsewhere. The donated funds had become joined with the University's general endowmment, resulting in efficiencies and benefits in fund management and performance, which were not {{the subject of the}} Robertsons' complaints. The case was amicably settled in 2008 with a return of some funds to the family.|$|E

25|$|Ryo {{appears in}} the anime OVA version of Art of Fighting from 1993. While looking for a cat, Ryo and Robert {{witnessed}} a murder related to a stolen diamond. After fighting the murdering mobsters, they discovered that the top mobster, Mr. Big, had kidnapped Ryo's sister to exchange <b>her</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> diamond, which he believes {{to be in the}} possession of the protagonists. He is voiced by Tetsuya Besho in the Japanese version, and by Alden Crews in the English adaptation.

In CGI animated series , Ryo reprises his role from The King of Fighters '94 where they meet and befriend the Esaka Team.|$|E
25|$|All of {{this would}} go to waste however, when Henry VI died of a fever in Messina on 28 September 1197. Following his death many of the higher ranking nobles {{abandoned}} the crusade to protect their interests in the Holy Roman Empire. When civil war broke out shortly after, the crusade found itself leaderless and in 1198 the crusaders retreated back to Tyre and sailed for home. The result was that the crusade had the detrimental effect of destroying Byzantium's dignity and wealth whilst failing to assist <b>her</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Turks. It must be said however that the Byzantines after 1180 entertained no serious plans to reclaim Anatolia from the Turks, so how much territory Henry VI or his predecessor Frederick I seized may have been of little consequence in the long run.|$|E
25|$|On 12 December 1911, while {{unloading}} {{potassium nitrate}} {{at the port}} of Santander, Spain, Laënnec was severely damaged when a storm pushed <b>her</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> pier and ripped the ship from her moorings, causing the full rigged ship to drift against a Dutch steam ship Rhehania. As there was no shipyard large enough to accommodate Laënnec in Santander, the ship was emptied and inclined until her damaged hull plating was exposed and could be repaired within the harbour. The repairs took 20 days and the ship, which by that time had become a popular attraction for the local people, left Spain on 1 February 1912. In 1914 the main mast of Laënnec broke off and fell over the starboard side when the ship was struck by a heavy storm in the North Atlantic Ocean. She was towed to Brest for repairs. On 12 June 1916 Captain Guriec died onboard Laënnec while the ship was passing the Cape of Good Hope on her way back to Europe. The command was assumed by the first mate who, according to some sources, also perished before the ship arrived in England. Later the command was given to Captain Émile Delanoë.|$|E

25|$|In October, when {{schemes for}} marrying Mary to an English nobleman were under consideration, Knollys {{proposed}} that his wife's nephew, George Carey, might prove a suitable match. In November the inquiry into Mary's misdeeds which had begun at York, was reopened at Westminster, and Knollys {{pointed out that}} he needed a larger company of retainers to keep his prisoner safe from a possible attempt at rescue. In December he was directed by Elizabeth to induce Mary to assent to her abdication of the Scottish throne. In January 1569 he plainly told Elizabeth that, in declining to allow Mary either to be condemned or to be acquitted on the charges brought against her, she was inviting perils which were likely to overwhelm her, and entreated her to leave the decision of Mary's fate to her well-tried councillors. On 20 January orders arrived at Bolton to transfer Mary to Tutbury, where the Earl of Shrewsbury was {{to take charge of}} <b>her.</b> <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> removal the Scottish queen protested in a pathetic note to Knollys, intended for Elizabeth's eye, but next day she was forced to leave Bolton, and Knollys remained with her at Tutbury till 3 February. His wife's death then called him home. Mary blamed Elizabeth for the fatal termination of Lady Knollys' illness, attributing it to her husband's enforced absence in the north.|$|E
25|$|Popular {{support for}} Musharraf {{declined}} when Nawaz Sharif, this time {{accompanied by his}} younger brother and his daughter, successfully made a second attempt to return from exile; hundreds of their supporters, including a few leaders of their party were detained before the pair arrived at Iqbal Terminal, on 25 November 2007. Nawaz Sharif filed his nomination papers for two seats in the forthcoming elections whilst Benazir Bhutto filed for three seats including one of the reserved seats for women. Departing an election rally in Rawalpindi on 27 December 2007, Benazir Bhutto was assassinated by a gunman who shot her in the neck and set off a bomb, killing 20 other people and injuring several more. The exact sequence of the events and cause of death became points of political debate and controversy, because, although early reports indicated that Benazir Bhutto was hit by shrapnel or the gunshots, the Pakistan Interior ministry maintained that her death was due from a skull fracture sustained when the explosive waves threw <b>her</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> sunroof of her vehicle. The issue remains controversial and the investigations were further conducted by British Scotland Yard. After a meeting in Islamabad, the Election Commission announced that, due to the assassination, the elections, which had been scheduled for 8 January 2008, would take place on 18 February.|$|E
25|$|After Towton, Warwick goes to France {{to secure}} for Edward {{the hand of}} Louis XI's sister-in-law, Lady Bona, thus {{ensuring}} peace {{between the two nations}} by uniting in marriage their two monarchies. Warwick arrives at the French court to find that Margaret, Prince Edward and the Earl of Oxford have come to Louis to seek his aid in the conflict in England. Just as Louis is about to agree to supply Margaret with troops, Warwick intervenes, and convinces Louis that it is in his interests to support Edward and approve the marriage. Back in England, however, the recently widowed Lady Grey (Elizabeth Woodville) has come to King Edward requesting her late husband's lands be returned to her. Edward is captivated by her beauty and promises to return her husband's lands to her if she become his mistress, but Lady Grey refuses. The two banter and Edward decides that, besides being beautiful, she is also clever and virtuous, and decides to marry <b>her</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> advice of both George and Richard. Upon hearing of this, feeling he has been made to look a fool despite service to the House of York, Warwick denounces Edward, and switches allegiance to the Lancastrians, promising his daughter Anne's hand in marriage to Prince Edward as a sign of his loyalty. Shortly thereafter, George and Montague also defect to the Lancastrians. Warwick then invades England with French troops, and Edward is taken prisoner while a heavily pregnant Lady Grey (now Queen Elizabeth) flees to sanctuary. Henry is restored to the throne, and appoints Warwick and George as his Lords Protector.|$|E
