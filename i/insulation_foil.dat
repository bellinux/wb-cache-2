50|$|Insulation {{paper or}} <b>insulation</b> <b>foil</b> is usually {{attached}} to the slots of the stator package before the insulated end plates are installed. The insulation material, e.g. Nomex or Mylar or Kapton, is taken from the endless strip. It is pre-hemmed, separated analogously {{to the length of}} the stator and inserted into the latter. It {{is important to note that}} the insulation strip must always be slightly longer than the stator package in order to guarantee complete insulation of the winding space towards the wire in consideration of the length tolerances of the stator package and the insulation paper. When this construction is applied, it is beneficial, that the insulation does not take up much space in the slot area. At high dielectric strength, an insulation thickness of merely 0.1 mm may be reached. Even at a material strength of only a few hundredths of a millimeter, Kapton foil may be integrated into the package. This in turn has a positive effect on the fill factor since more room is available for winding.|$|E

State-of-the-art applications for passenger vehicles consist of double-wall cylindrical tanks that hold a hydrogen storage mass {{of up to}} 10 kg. The preferred shell material of the tanks is stainless steel, since it is very resistant against hydrogen brittleness and shows negligible hydrogen permeation.

The space between the inner and outer vessel is mainly used for thermal super-insulation purposes. Several layers of <b>insulation</b> <b>foils</b> and high vacuums of 10 - 3 Pa reduce the heat entry. The support structures, which keep the inner tank in position to the outer tank, are made of materials with low thermal conductivity, e. g. glass or carbon fiber reinforced plastics.

40|$|This paper proposes ground-in-the-loop, model-based visual {{localization}} {{system based}} on transmitted images to ground, to aid rendezvous and docking maneuvers between a servicer and a target satellite. In particular, we assume {{to deal with a}} partially cooperative target, i. e. passive and without fiducial markers, but supposed at least to keep a controlled attitude, up to small fluctuations, so that the approach mainly involves translational motion. For the purpose of localization, video cameras provide an effective and relatively inexpensive solution, working at a wide range of distances with an increasing accuracy and robustness during the approach. However, illumination conditions in space are especially challenging, due to the direct sunlight exposure and to the glossy surface of a satellite, that creates strong reflections and saturations and therefore a high level of background clutter and missing detections. We employ a monocular camera for mid-range tracking View the MathML source(20 – 5 m) and stereo camera at close-range View the MathML source(5 – 0. 5 m), with the respective detection and tracking methods, both using intensity edges and robustly dealing with the above issues.

40|$|Detailed {{studies of}} {{preserved}} hypervelocity impact residues on spacecraft multi-layer <b>insulation</b> <b>foils</b> have yielded important {{information about the}} flux of small particles from different sources in low-Earth orbit (LEO). We have extended our earlier research on impacts occurring in LEO to design and testing of a compact capture device. MUlti-Layer Polymer EXperiment (MULPEX) is simple, cheap to build, lightweight, of no power demand, easy to deploy, and optimised for the efficient collection of impact residue for analysis on return to Earth. The capture medium is a stack of very thin (8 and 40 mu m) polyimide foils, supported on polytetrafluoroethylene sheet frames, surrounded by a protective aluminium casing. The uppermost foil has a very thin metallic coating for thermal protection and resistance to atomic oxygen and ultra-violet exposure. The casing provides a simple detachable interface for deployment on the spacecraft, facing into the desired direction for particle collection. On return to the laboratory, the stacked foils are separated for examination in a variable pressure scanning electron microscope, without need for surface coating. Analysis of impact residue is performed using energy dispersive X-ray spectrometers. Our laboratory experiments, utilising buck-shot firings of analogues to micrometeoroids (35 - 38 mu m olivine) and space debris (4 mu m alumina and 1 mm stainless steel) in a light gas gun, have shown that impact residue is abundant within the foil layers, and preserves {{a record of the}} impacting particle, whether of micrometer or millimetre dimensions. Penetrations of the top foil are easily recognised, and act as a proxy for dimensions of the penetrating particle.
