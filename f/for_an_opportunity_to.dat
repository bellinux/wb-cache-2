5|$|Before he {{was elected}} king of the Commonwealth, Władysław fought in many campaigns, seeking {{personal}} glory. After his final campaign against Russians in 1617–1618 (the end of Dymitriads), in 1619 he went to Silesia, looking <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> aid the Habsburgs in their struggle against the Czech Hussites in the Thirty Years' War.

5|$|In later years, Wolff said he {{was always}} wary of Heydrich, {{who seemed to be}} waiting <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> move against him and disgrace him with Himmler. Within the Allgemeine-SS, Heydrich forged {{relationships}} with some of the more powerful SS and Police Leaders such as Friedrich Jeckeln. Heydrich maintained a dialogue with him, but cautiously, especially after Jeckeln ran afoul of Himmler in the late 1930s and early 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Ministers in the Madras {{government}} and ruling party members supported the strike. On 29 August 1921, the police opened fire and killed {{six of the}} workers on the spot. Top Justice Party leaders like O. Thanikachalam Chetti severely censured the police for the measures they adopted. The main reason was that the police was {{under the control of}} the governor and the government was looking <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> harass the executive. Another probable reason was that the striking workers had the caste sympathies of the Justice Party government whose ministers and chief whips were caste Hindus like themselves.|$|E

As it was in the occupation zone allocated to the Soviet Union at the Yalta Conference, the Alsos Mission, led by Boris Pash and accompanied by Lansdale, arrived on 17 April to remove anything of interest. Over the following ten days, 260 truckloads of uranium ore, sodium uranate and ferro-uranium weighing about 1,000 tons were taken away.|$|E
5|$|The Crusader army's pace was {{dictated}} by the infantry and baggage train; the Ayyubid army, being largely mounted, {{had the advantage of}} superior mobility. Efforts to burn crops and deny the countryside to the Frankish army were largely ineffective as it could be continuously provisioned from the fleet, which moved south parallel with it. On 25 August the Crusader rearguard was crossing a defile when it was almost cut off. However, the Crusaders closed up so speedily that the Muslim soldiery was forced to flee. From 26 to 29 August Richard's army had a respite from attack because while it hugged the coast and had gone round the shoulder of Mount Carmel, Saladin's army had struck across country. Saladin arrived in the vicinity of Caesarea before the Crusaders, who were on a longer road. From 30 August to 7 September Saladin was always within striking distance, and waiting <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> attack if the Crusaders exposed themselves.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, E.V. Ramasamy's chief lieutenant, Conjeevaram Natarajan Annadurai, {{established}} a separate association called the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), or Dravidian Progressive Federation. This {{was due to}} differences between the two, while Periyar advocated a separate independent Dravidian or Tamil state, Annadurai compromised with the Delhi government, {{at the same time}} claiming increased state independence. E.V. Ramasamy was convinced that individuals and movements that undertake the task of eradicating the social evils in the Indian sub-continent have to pursue the goal with devotion and dedication without deviating from the path and with uncompromising zeal. Thus, if they contest elections aiming to assume political power, they would lose vigour and sense of purpose. But among his followers, there were those who had a different view, wanting to enter into politics and have a share in running the government. They were looking <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> part with E.V. Ramasamy. Thus, when E.V. Ramasamy married Maniammai on 9 July 1948, they quit the Dravidar Kazhagam, stating that E.V. Ramasamy married maniammayar who was daughter of kanagasabhai when he was 70 and she 32. Those who parted company with E.V. Ramasamy joined the DMK. Though the DMK split from the Dravidar Kazhagam, the organisation made efforts to carry on E.V. Ramasamy's Self-Respect Movement to villagers and urban students. The DMK advocated the thesis that the Tamil language was much richer than Sanskrit and Hindi in content, and thus was a key which opened the door to subjects to be learned. The Dravidar Kazhagam continued to counter Brahminism, Indo-Aryan propaganda, and uphold the Dravidians' right of self-determination.|$|E

5|$|In mid-September {{the family}} moved to 42 Brunswick Terrace, Brighton on the south coast of England where tranquillity of life contrasted greatly with the revolutionary Europe left behind. Parliamentary figures, {{particularly}} Disraeli, travelled down to visit them, as did Metternich's former friend Dorothea Lieven (Melanie led a reconciliation between the two). Expecting a visit from Metternich's daughter Leontine and her own daughter Pauline, {{the family moved}} to a suite of rooms at Richmond Palace on 23 April 1849. Visitors included Wellington, who still watched out for Metternich; Johann Strauss, the composer; and Dorothea de Dino, sister of Metternich's former lover Wilhemine of Sagan; and former lover Katharina Bagration. Metternich was showing his age, and his frequent fainting was cause for worry. The ex-Chancellor was also depressed by the lack of communication from the new Emperor Franz Joseph I and his government. Leontine wrote to Vienna trying to encourage this contact, and in August Metternich received a warm letter from Franz Joseph; sincere or not, it buoyed Metternich considerably. From mid-August Melanie began to push for a move to Brussels, a city cheaper to live in and closer to continental affairs. They arrived in October, staying overnight in the Hotel Bellevue. With revolution subsiding, Metternich was hopeful they would return to Vienna. Their stay in fact lasted over 18 months while Metternich waited <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> re-enter Austrian politics. It was a pleasant enough (and cheap) stay, first in the Boulevard de l'Observatoire and later in the Sablon area—filled with visits from politicians, writers, musicians and scientists. For Metternich, however, the tedium and homesickness only increased. In March 1851 Melanie induced him to write to the new political force in Vienna, Prince Schwarzenberg, to ask if he might return if he promised not to interfere in public affairs. In April he received an affirmative reply, authorised by Franz Joseph.|$|E
5|$|That same year, Brian Hodgson, who {{had spent}} many years in Nepal serving as the Assistant Resident, and who had a good {{knowledge}} about Nepal's bio-diversity, culture, and politics, became the new British Resident. Although the British Residents were officially instructed {{to keep out of}} the internal politics of Nepal, the Resident was courted by both the King as well as the Mukhtiyar. Hodgson was waiting <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> exploit the rift between the Mukhtiyar and the royal family and begin a more aggressive campaign to increase British influence and trading opportunities. Hodgson also believed the large standing army to be a security threat and that the border tensions could be pacified if the King was directly in control, rather than a mukhtiyar who needed to keep {{on the right side of}} the army. By 1834, Hodgson had come to a conclusion that he would not be able to have his way so long as Bhimsen was in control of the Nepalese administration; thus he strongly sympathized with the Pande faction, and he wished to install Fateh Jung Shah, who was more favorably disposed to him, as the mukhtiyar. In August 1834, Hodgson proposed to conduct a new commercial treaty between Nepal and Britain, which Bhimsen in principle agreed to but disagreed with several of the clauses. At a time when his authority was diminishing, Bhimsen could not afford to antagonize the Resident; but at the same time, he could not accept his proposals and be seen as subservient to the British by the Nepalese court. Nevertheless, he tried to maintain a friendly and conciliatory attitude toward the Resident, in order to win him as his ally, by loosening the restrictions on his movements and granting direct access to the King.|$|E
