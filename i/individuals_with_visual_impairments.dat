Both low- and high-tech devices can incorporate the use of symbols. With low-tech devices, a communication partner is involved and must interpret the symbols chosen. Picture Communication Exchange System (PECS) is a commonly used low-tech communication system that teach individuals how to request, comment, and answer questions through the use of line drawings known as picture communication symbols (PCS). , a high-tech communication system, is an app that incorporates various symbols and motor planning. Symbols are placed in fixed position on the screen which allow users to develop motor patterns associated with certain requests or statements. The choice of symbols and aspects of their presentation, such as size and background, depend on an individual's preferences as well as their linguistic, visual, and cognitive skills. This can be determined using an assessment for symbolic understanding.|$|E

Participants were randomly assigned to adapted physical activities (N= 12) and control (N= 12) groups. Their age ranged from 18 to 25 years. The participants had not taken part in any regular exercise program before entering to this study. The experimental group has undergone 6 weeks of adapted physical activities, whereas control group maintained their daily routine activities and no special training was given. Training program for <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> was 30 minutes in length and met 3 days a week. Supervised exercise training is an important issue in increasing physical activity in people <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> The training was executed by adapting progressive method as slower pace and frequent repetition to aid in the maintenance of acquired skills. The following tests were performed: cardiorespiratory endurance (600 yard run/walk endurance test) and leg explosive power (standing broad jump). In the present study for the sake of analysis of data, mean and standard deviation of the variables were calculated and statistical t-test was used to compare the mean. The level of significance was set at p< 0. 05 level of confidence. For statistical calculations SPSS Statistical Package version 16 was used. The t test revealed that the adapted physical activitieshad significantly improved both variables namely cardiorespiratory endurance and leg explosive power.

It brings relaxation, physical and mental relief and stress reduction. Leisure time also plays an important role in casual and informal integration. Sports activities constitute an ideal tool for involvement and integration of <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> into the society. These activities have a considerable benefit in the prevention of secondary impacts in <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> The theoretical part consists of three main chapters. The first section defines the term ?quality of life. ? The second section of the theoretical part addresses the term ?<b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> ? The final section of the theoretical part defines the term ?leisure time?. The practical part of the bachelor thesis contains research objectives and research questions. The data were collected in a qualitative procedure, using the technique of a structured interview with open-ended questions. The research set consisted of four respondents <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> from the region of České Budějovice. The objective of the bachelor thesis is to perform a qualitative research to introduce sports activities as a possible tool of prevention of secondary impacts of <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> The above stated objective has two sub-objectives. A qualitative procedure was selected for achieving the objectives of the practical part of the bachelor thesis. The research took place through structured interviews with open-ended questions. The data collected from the respondents helped me to answer the below stated research questions. Research question No. 1 : What is {{the importance of}} sports activities from the view of an <b>individual</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment?</b> It is possible to state that the main benefit of sports activities for all the respondents is the improvement of both mental and physical condition, wellbeing and stress relief. These activities have a positive effect in the area of relieving the tension and having fun, and contribute to the feeling of living the day to the fullest. Research question No. 2 : What sports activities do the respondents <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> perform? The qualitative research has clearly shown that the sports activity most commonly performed by the respondents is swimming, followed by hiking and riding a tandem bike. Research question No. 3 : Why do the respondents <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> not perform sports activities in their leisure time? Ascertain the reasons. The qualitative analysis of the collected data has shown that the obstacles for performing sports activities in leisure time have an external nature. The reasons are either organizational problems or absence of assistance or guiding services. It has followed from the conclusions derived in relation to the first sub-objective that according to the analyzed individuals, the most common obstacle for performing sports activities is a limited availability of assistance. Another obstacle for performing the activities is their costs and problems with accessibility by transport. The outputs obtained in relation to the second sub-objective have proven that a very beneficial and preferred activity of the research set is swimming. Other sports activities conducted by them are hiking and riding a tandem bike. The analysis has shown that these activities have a positive effect particularly on the locomotor system. All these activities have a great benefit for the prevention of secondary impacts in <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> The bachelor thesis may be used as a study material for the students of related branches due to the narrow specialization of the thesis in the branch of special education of people <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairment...</b>|$|R

The quality of the development process was assessed using a modified version of a PROM quality assessment tool. Results: A total of 142 PROMs were identified, 34 vision-specific PROMs were relevant and available to be analysed in this review. Quality appraisal identified four highly rated instruments: the National Eye Institute Visual Functional Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ), Activity Inventory (AI), Daily Living Tasks Dependant on Vision (DLTV) and Veterans Affairs Low Visual Function Questionnaire (VA LV VFQ).
