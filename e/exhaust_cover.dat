50|$|The catastrophic {{malfunction}} {{that led}} to Skif entering {{the atmosphere in the}} same area as Energia's second stage was successfully investigated. It was found that 568 seconds after launch, the timing control device gave the logical block a command to discard the side modules' <b>covers</b> and laser <b>exhaust</b> <b>covers.</b> Unknowingly, the same command was earlier used to open the solar panels and disengage the maneuvering thrusters. This wasn't discovered because of the logistics of the testing process and overall haste. Main thrusters engaged while the Skif kept turning, overshooting the intended 180-degree turn. The spacecraft lost speed and reverted to the ballistic trajectory.|$|R

50|$|The chapel was {{constructed}} from limited materials by the prisoners. Two Nissen huts were joined end-to-end. The corrugated interior was then covered with plasterboard and {{the altar and}} altar rail were constructed from concrete left over from work on the barriers. Most of the interior decoration was done by Domenico Chiocchetti, a prisoner from Moena. He painted the sanctuary end of the chapel and fellow-prisoners decorated the entire interior. They created a facade out of concrete, concealing {{the shape of the}} hut and making the building look like a church. The light holders were made out of corned beef tins. The baptismal font was made from the inside of a car <b>exhaust</b> <b>covered</b> in a layer of concrete.|$|R

The metal bars were hollowed out and bent by [...] "Racing Innovations" [...] resulting in a heavier than normal frame. Following the [...] "allen wrench" [...] theme, Paul Jr. bent sheets of 16 gauge cold rolled steel to create hex shaped <b>exhaust</b> <b>covers.</b> A fake oil tank {{was made in the}} shape of a miniature toolbox (the real oil tank was hidden on the bottom of the frame). The entire bike was sprayed with Snap-on's official red paint. As a hidden detail, an authentic ratchet was modified and used as kickstand.|$|R

50|$|The XCO5 {{needed a}} {{high-lift}} wing suitable for high-altitude work. New wings were prepared. The aerofoil was Joukowsky StAe-27A, a heavily cambered wingshape {{with a thick}} leading edge. The upper and lower wings had a pronounced stagger, with a total wing area of 600 ft2. As well as lining and insulating the cockpit, heat {{was taken from the}} engine <b>exhaust.</b> A <b>cover</b> {{over the top of the}} cockpit kept the heat in; a clear panel in the cover allowed the pilot to see his instruments.|$|R
5000|$|The Basty {{was also}} {{believed}} to [...] "ride" [...] horses, which left them <b>exhausted</b> and <b>covered</b> in sweat by the morning.

As little do I envy the feelings of that man, who can view the peoples of the Netherlands driven into insurrection, and struggling for their freedom against the heavy hand of a merciless tyranny, without entertaining any suspicion of what may be the sense of the word deliverance. Does such a man contemplate Holland groaning under arbitrary oppressions and exactions? Does he turn his eyes to Spain trembling at the nod of a foreign master? And does the word deliverance still sound unintelligibly in his ear? Has he heard of the rescue and salvation of Naples, by the appearance and the triumphs of the British fleet? Does he know that the monarchy of Naples maintains its existence at the sword's point? And is his understanding, and his heart, still impenetrable to the sense and meaning of the deliverance of Europe? ...|$|R
5000|$|From 1888 to 1963, Priscilla {{was owned}} and {{operated}} by several oystermen from Connecticut and New York. During these years, she experienced many changes. The oystermen spoke of [...] "Pris" [...] as a fast, able and [...] "smart" [...] boat - a [...] "money maker" [...] because, unlike other boats, she could dredge well in both light and heavy winds. By 1963, the oyster beds were completely <b>exhausted</b> or <b>covered</b> with silt from storms and hurricanes of the previous decades. Priscilla {{was one of the last}} of the Chesapeake Bay.

At first he claimed to be a private, but his jewels betrayed him, and then he said he was one of Santa Anna's aides-de-camp. But no one believed him, and he was taken into the Texan camp without delay. Here there was a most dramatic scene between General Houston and his noted prisoner. Houston, <b>exhausted</b> and <b>covered</b> with the dirt of battle, lay at the foot of a tree, where he had just taken a nap after having his ankle dressed.|$|R
5000|$|In January 1941, Cheshire {{completed}} his tour of operations, but then volunteered immediately {{for a second}} tour. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) in March 1941 and was promoted to the war substantive rank of flight lieutenant on 7 April. He was posted to No. 35 Squadron with the brand new Handley Page Halifax and {{completed his}} second tour early in 1942, by then a temporary squadron leader. Cheshire was promoted to the substantive rank of squadron leader on 1 March. August 1942 saw a return to operations as an acting wing commander and commanding officer of No. 76 Squadron RAF. The squadron had recently suffered high losses operating the Halifax, and Cheshire immediately tackled the low morale of the unit by ordering an improvement {{in the performance of}} the squadron aircraft by removing the mid-upper and nose gun turrets along with <b>exhaust</b> <b>covers</b> and other weighty non-essential equipment. This allowed the bombers to fly higher and faster. Losses soon fell and morale rose accordingly. Cheshire was amongst the first to note there was very low return rate of Halifax bombers on three engines; furthermore, there were reports the Halifax was unstable in a [...] "corkscrew" [...] which was the manoeuvre used by bomber pilots to escape night fighters. The test pilot Captain Eric Brown, flying uncrewed except for an accompanying flight engineer, undertook risky tests to establish the cause and were told a representative of Bomber Command would fly with them. Brown remembers [...] "We couldn't believe it, it was Cheshire! We were astonished to say the least. I asked him not to touch (the controls) and to his ever lasting credit he never commented at all, he just sat in the second pilot's seat and raised his eye brows at what we were doing!" [...] The fault was in the Halifax's rudder design and Cheshire became enraged when Handley Page at first declined to make modifications so as not to disrupt production.|$|R
6000|$|And now the {{struggle}} began. Dick knew well enough, from hearsay, {{the method of}} [...] "breaking down" [...] a wild horse. He knew that the Indians choke them with the noose round the neck until they fall down <b>exhausted</b> and <b>covered</b> with foam, when they creep up, fix the hobbles and {{the line in the}} lower jaw, and then loosen the lasso to let the horse breathe, and resume its plungings till it is almost subdued, when they gradually draw near and breathe into its nostrils. But the violence and strength of this animal rendered this an apparently hopeless task. We have already seen that the hobbles and noose in the lower jaw had been fixed, so that Dick had nothing now to do but to choke his captive, and tire him out, while Crusoe remained a quiet, though excited spectator of the scene.|$|R
40|$|Over {{time the}} process of {{incremental}} deformation Die-less has been developed in many ways {{to meet the needs}} of flexible production with no investment in tooling and low production costs. Two of their configurations are the SPIF (Single point incremental forming) and DPIF (Double point Incremental forming) technique. The aim of this study is to compare both techniques with the purpose of exposing their advantages and disadvantages in the production of industrial parts, as well as to inform about Die-less as an alternative manufacturing process. Experiments with the <b>exhaust</b> pipe <b>cover</b> of a vehicle are performed, the main process parameters are described, and formed workpieces without evidence of defects are achieved. Significant differences between the two techniques in terms of production times and accuracy to the original model are also detected. Finally, it is suggested when is more convenient to use each of these...|$|R
50|$|In 2005, number 102 was {{selected}} for restoration to working order, while 101 was chosen to be cannibalised for spare parts to restore 102. However, the attempt to restore 102 did not occur because {{of a series of}} external issues, and so the locomotive was left in storage in the Whitehead sidings. All openings such as the <b>exhaust</b> outlet were <b>covered</b> over to prevent rainwater ingress from damaging the cylinder heads, but other than covering these openings, no further work was taken.
