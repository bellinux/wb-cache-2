40|$|The {{signalling}} pathways of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and epidermal {{growth factor}} receptors (EGFRs) {{have been shown to}} communicate in mitogenic processes in many cells. Several mechanisms have been suggested to explain this; in particular transactivation is a mechanism that seems to be involved in many cases where signalling pathways intermingle. We have observed that prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and other GPCR ligands enhance the mitogenic effect of {{epidermal growth factor}} (EGF) on hepatocytes. In this study we suggest that cross-talk between the pathways activated by these two agonists is not dependent on transactivation but a result of altered gene transcription caused by stimulation with PGE 2. Our results indicate that transcription is altered so as to induce proteins that prolongate signalling in the EGFR pathway. These proteins inhibit the deactivation of the extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK), which is an important component in the pathway <b>dowstream</b> of the EGFR...|$|E

In the present study, the complete, unambiguous primary amino acid sequence of the peptide was obtained {{by a combination of}} both N-terminal sequencing of purified peptide and the complete sequence deduced from the structural gene harbored by plasmid I 4. Data revealed that this peptide of 44 residues has an amino acid sequence similar to that described for pediocins AcH and PA- 1, produced by different Pediococcus acidilactici strains and 100 % identical. Coagulin and pediocin differed only by a single amino acid at their C terminus.

40|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that deregulation of prolactin (PRL) signaling contributes to pathogenesis and chemoresistance of breast cancer. Therefore, understanding cross-talk between distinct signal transduction pathways triggered by activation of the prolactin receptor (PRL-R), is essential for elucidating the pathogenesis of metastatic breast cancer. In this study, we applied a sequential inhibitory analysis of various signaling intermediates to examine the hierarchy of protein interactions within the PRL signaling network and to evaluate the relative contributions of multiple signaling branches downstream of PRL-R to the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK 1 and ERK 2 in T 47 D and MCF- 7 human breast cancer cells. Quantitative measurements of the phosphorylation/activation patterns of proteins showed that PRL simultaneously activated Src family kinases (SFKs) and the JAK/STAT, phosphoinositide- 3 (PI 3) -kinase/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways. The specific blockade or siRNA-mediated suppression of SFK/FAK, JAK 2 /STAT 5, PI 3 -kinase/PDK 1 /Akt, Rac/PAK or Ras regulatory circuits revealed that (1) the PI 3 -kinase/Akt pathway is required for activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade upon PRL stimulation; (2) PI 3 -kinase-mediated activation of the c-Raf-MEK 1 / 2 -ERK 1 / 2 cascade occurs independent of signaling <b>dowstream</b> of STATs, Akt and PKC, but requires JAK 2, SFKs and FAK activities; (3) activated PRL-R mainly utilizes the PI 3 -kinase-dependent Rac/PAK pathway rather than the canonical Shc/Grb 2 /SOS/Ras route to initiate and sustain ERK 1 / 2 signaling.

It remains to be determined what causes the transition from ″physiological″ to ″apoptotic″ UPR, but accumulating evidence indicates that signaling by the ER transmembrane protein IRE 1 α is critical for this transition. IRE 1 α activation is regulated by both intra ER and cytosolic cues. We evaluated the role for the presently discovered cytokine-induced and IRE 1 α-interacting protein, Ubiquitin D (UBD) on the regulation of IRE 1 α and its <b>dowstream</b> targets. UBD was identified by use of a MAPPIT (MAmmalian Protein-Protein Interaction Trap) -based IRE 1 α interactome screen followed by comparison against functional genomic analysis of human and rodent beta cells exposed to pro-inflammatory cytokines. Knock down (KD) of UBD in human and rodent beta cells and detailed signal transduction studies indicated that UBD modulates cytokine-induced UPR/ IRE 1 α activation and apoptosis. UBD expression is induced by the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) - 1 β and interferon (IFN) -γ in rat and human pancreatic beta cells and it is also up-regulated in beta cells of inflamed islets from NOD mice. UBD interacts with IRE 1 α in human and rodent beta cells, modulating IRE 1 α-dependent activation of JNK and cytokine-induced apoptosis. Our data suggest that UBD provides a negative feedback on cytokine-induced activation of the IRE 1 α/JNK pro-apoptotic pathway in cytokine-exposed beta cells. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Seed {{germination}} is {{the transition}} of the quiescent embryo into a new photosintetically active plant, and {{is defined by the}} radicle protrusion from the seed coat. It is controlled by multiple environmental and endogenous factors. Germination of seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana needs a pulse of red light and is mediated mainly by the photoreceptor phytochrome B (phyB). A key role is also played by phytohormones, such as abscissic acid (ABA) and gibberellin (GA), which play an antagonistic role. In fact, ABA inhibits this process, whereas GA triggers seed germination. PIL 5 is a phytocrome-interacting bHLH protein and is the master repressor of light-mediated seed germination. PIL 5 directly induces the expression of RGA and GAI, encoding two DELLA proteins, which are negative regulators of GA-mediated processes. We have previously shown that DAG 1, a Dof transcription factor, also plays a central role in this light-mediated process. DAG 1 acts <b>dowstream</b> of PIL 5 and negatively regulates GA biosynthesis by directly repressing the AtGA 3 ox 1 gene. We are currently investigating the functional and molecular relationship between RGA, GAI and DAG 1 by using a combined genetic and molecular approach. Our results suggest that RGA and GAI have different functions with respect to DAG 1 in repressing seed germination. In fact, our data shows that the expression level of DAG 1 and GAI, but not of RGA, are mutually regulated in the seed. Moreover, GAI, similarly to DAG 1, is likely to partecipate in the repression of the AtGA 3 ox 1 gene. Interestingly, genetic analyses indicate that DAG 1 and GAI could have also a function during embryogenesis, as the dag 1 gai-t 6 double mutant is embryo-lethal. We conclude that DAG 1 and GAI may cooperate in both seed germination and embryo development...|$|E
40|$|The anti-atherogenic {{properties}} of CLA are now illustrated in many animal studies (Rabbit, Mice and Hamster) or cell culture experiments. These properties {{can be observed}} while using either the CLA isomeric mixture (cis 9,trans 11 - and trans 10,cis 12 -, 50  : 50) or selected CLA isomers (cis 9,trans 11 - or trans 10,cis 12 -). Especially, these fatty acids consistently attenuate the outcome of primary vascular lesions (fatty streaks), or can even induce a regression of pre-established lesions. There is, paradoxically, no clear relationship between this beneficial effect and an improvement of the lipid status in blood (triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol) usually considered as a hallmark in the etiology of atherosclerosis. On the other hand, recent data obtained both in vitro and in vivo indicate {{that part of the}} beneficial effects of CLA occurs through the modulation of vascular inflammatory and oxidant stress factors (cytokines and cyclooxygenase), {{as well as from the}} expression of adhesion molecules (VCAM, ICAM) in the aorta. This regulation involves the interaction of CLA with transcription factors such as PPARs, LXR and NF-kB targeting the gene expression <b>dowstream.</b> In human, clinical trials are no more conclusive than the animal experiments with regards to the contribution of CLA to modulate the lipid status in blood. Nevertheless, some data highlight the pro-atherogenic role of CLA and especially of the trans 10,cis 12 -isomer, as demonstrated by the increase in the various markers of oxidative stress (isoprostanes) and inflammatory status (C-reactive protein). In conclusion, whereas there is compelling evidence that feeding mixed or pure isomers of CLA attenuates atherosclerosis initiation and progression in several experimental models, human studies are less convincing. Nevertheless, clinical trials addressing sufficient risk factors and risk markers together are still lacking to draw a definitive conclusion and to set up obvious recommandations. The use of the sole blood lipids do not seem to be appropriate for such an evaluation...|$|E

In order to better identify the sources and cycling processes of Zn in this River basin, we investigated seasonal and spatial variations of Zn speciation in suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the oxic water column of the Seine River from upstream to downstream of Paris using synchrotron-based Extend X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy at the Zn K-edge. First-neighbor contributions to the EXAFS were analyzed in SPM samples dried and stored under a dry nitrogen atmosphere or under an ambient oxygenated atmosphere. We found a sulfur first coordination environment around Zn (in the form of amorphous zinc sulfide) in the raw SPM samples stored under dry nitrogen vs. an oxygen first coordination environment around Zn in the samples stored in an oxygenated atmosphere. These findings are supported by scanning electron microscopic and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry observations. Linear combination fitting of the EXAFS data for SPM samples, using a large set of EXAFS spectra of Zn model compounds, indicate dramatic changes in the Zn speciation from upstream to downstream of Paris, with amorphous ZnS particles becoming dominant <b>dowstream.</b> In contrast, Zn species associated with calcite (either adsorbed or incorporated in the structure) are dominant upstream. Other Zn species representing about half of the Zn pool in the SPM consist of Zn-sorbed on iron oxyhydroxides (ferrihydrite and goethite) and, to a lesser extent, Zn-Al layered double hydroxides and Zn incorporated in dioctahedral layers of clay minerals. Our results highlight the importance of preserving the oxidation state in TM speciation studies when sampling suspended matter, even in an oxic water column. They also demonstrate that systematic use of such careful sampling procedures may reveal the presence of reduced solid phases that might have been overlooked in previous studies of type B metal-bearing samples in oxic surface water columns...|$|E

40|$|The {{problems}} of eutrophication in the lowland rivers of Britain have been exacerbated {{in the past}} 13 years by the droughts of 1989 - 92 and 1995 - 96. Large growths of filamentous algae have smothered aquatic vascular plants (major primary producers) in lowland calcareous streams and phosphorus enrichment has been blamed for a shift in submerged plant species composition and community structure. This study investigated the impact of phosphorus removal from two sewage treatment works (STWs) situated in the River Wensum catchment area, Norfolk, UK. The mesology of aquatic vascular plants was investigated through a survey at 62 sites spread over four river basins: Wensum, Nar, Bure, Wissey. The landscape is predominantly rural (crops and pasture) not rising above 90 metres (OD). The average background concentrations of phosphorus from diffuse sources were: soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) 13 microg/L, total dissolved phosphorus 24 ug/L and total phosphorus (TP) 53 microg/L. Before phosphorus stripping (1990 - 1999), the background contributed about 12 % of the TP loads (0. 08 - 0. 10 kg/ha/year of TP) and after (2000 - 2001) it was about 34 % for two reasons, the phosphorus stripping plus effects due to higher rainfall (0. 13 - 0. 18 kg/ha/year of TP). The level of bioavailable phosphorus from the river-bed sediment was highest at sites impacted by both the effluents and weirs associated with mills. Phosphorus removal effectively reduced the TP load contribution of the two STWs from 42 % to 18 % of the effluents in the whole catchment. However the predicted levels of SRP at mean flow (140 - 273 microg/L) and 95 % exceedance discharge (415 - 1039 microg/L) <b>dowstream</b> from the STWs, remained very high. An isozyme technique was developed to identify the eight British species of Callitriche L. (water-starworts). This allowed the chorology of Callitriche in the rivers of Norfolk to be determined. Aquatic vascular plant composition, species Natural Combination of Attributes (NCAs - life history trade-offs) and community structure {{did not respond to}} the gradient of nutrients (SRP 11 - 3600 microg/L, nitrate 6. 4 - 12. 9 mg/L, ionised ammonia 16 - 434 microg/L). Species composition did respond, however, to the biogeographical units and distance of the site from the source (surrogate for species probability of colonisation) and channel depth/substrata (species environmental requirements). Even the most obvious geomorphological factors were only weak predictors of the NCAs. Moreover, the NCAs were linked, although only marginally, to the spatial structure of the river network, a surrogate for species probability of dispersal. Therefore the idea of using the species' attribute approach as currently applied to aquatic vascular plants seems falsely optimistic. The lack of dominance within plant communities suggested that demographic processes as well as inter-species competition might have occurred at the local scale as predicted by the patch dynamics concept. However, the different probabilities of colonisation of the sites as well as the regional species pool may dictate the local processes of plant community structure and composition in a directional river network. This study indicates the need for a unification of the niche and demography theories at multiple spatial and temporal scales. The species' demographic dynamics, the catchment- based habitat heterogeneity and the regional species pool should therefore always be taken into account for conservation and management purposes. Wetlands should be preserved and restored as much as possible to maintain the regional species pool which will ensure the persistence of the riverine flora...|$|E
40|$|Dp 427 is a {{cortical}} cytoskeletal protein {{expressed by}} skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscles, and by some populations {{of central and}} autonomic neurons. Tissues other than muscles express also shorter dystrophin isoforms. Progressive and lethal muscle degeneration is the main characteristic of the disease. However, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) patients also experience different forms of cognitive impairment, neurological and autonomic disorders, altered scotopic electroretinogram and red-green color vision defects. Differently from muscles, DMD-related damages to nervous system are established during embryonic development and are not progressive after birth, suggesting a role for all dystrophins in nervous system development and differentiation. My PhD project {{is focused on the}} possible role for Dp 427 in the following aspects: axonal regeneration of autonomic neurons, specifically dependent on NGF for their survival; neuritic and axonal growth of hippocampal neurons and retinal development, by using genetically dystrophic mice (mdx) and their wild-type (wt) control. Previous studies on the autonomic superior cervical ganglion (SCG) of mdx mice, demonstrated several developmental alterations of SCG neurons: in vitro experiments revealed a reduction in NGF-dependent neuritic outgrowth of mdx mouse neurons compared to the wt, and in vivo axotomy demonstrated a loss of regeneration of adrenergic axons projecting to muscular targets, containing low levels of NGF. Furthermore, protein levels of activated NGF receptor, the pTrkA receptor, and of some kinases <b>dowstream</b> the NGF-TrkA signaling are reduced. These data suggested that mdx mouse SGC neurons are less sensitive to NGF compared to wt and that limited amount of NGF could alter the dynamics of axonal growth and regeneration of these neurons. In order to confirm that the altered axonal regeneration previously observed in mdx mice in vivo depends on intrinsic neuronal damages, we analysed wt and mdx mouse SCG axon regeneration in vitro, without the influence of their target tissues, by using microfluidic chambers which allow to separate somas and axons in two different compartments and to treat the two sides independently. 24 h after in vitro axotomy of SCG neuron axons in the presence of limited amount of NGF, we observed a significant {{reduction in the number of}} regenerated axons in mdx mouse neuron cultures compared to the wt. Moreover, co-immunolocalization of TrkA and some Dystrophin-Glycoprotein Complex proteins in the growth cone of SCG axons revealed a reduced co-localization in mdx neurons compared to the wt, leading to the hypothesis that Dp 427 contributes to TrkA stabilization in growth cone. Therefore, the lack of Dp 427 may cause a reduction in membrane TrkA stabilization and, consequently, reduction in the NGF intracellular signaling cascade. To verify whether the role of Dp 427 in neurite growth was exclusive of NGF-dependent neurons, or could be important also for other types of neurons, we analysed the same parameters in hippocampal neurons in vitro. These central neurons are functionally affected by the lack of Dp 427 in both DMD patients and animal models. Differently from the SCG neurons, we did not observe differences in neuritic growth parameters between the two genotypes. We, therefore, specifically analysed axonal growth of hippocampal neurons in the microfluidic chambers, in correlation with the activity of the neurotrophic factor BDNF. Hippocampal neurons are responsive to BDNF which increases axonal growth even if is not necessary for survival. Our results demonstrate that axonal growth is slower in the mdx genotype compared to wt, in both presence and absence of BDNF. Retina is characterized by different cell types arranged according to a complex organization, which is finely specified by sequential gene expression during development. Different isoforms of dystrophin are found in the synapses between photoreceptors and bipolar cells, in the inner and outer nuclear layers and in amacrine cells. Absence of dystrophin mainly induces the destabilization of glutamate receptors and alterations of the electroretinogram. In order to identify possible alterations in mdx mouse retinal development, we analysed wt and mdx mouse retinas at different post-natal stages: P 0, P 5, P 10 and adults (6 - 7 weeks). We performed a comparative morphometric analysis on retina sections from wt and mdx mice, in order to identify possible alterations in the formation of the different layers. The obtained results show that, at P 0, the entire retina and the ganglion cell layer (GCL) were significantly thicker in mdx mice compared to wt. Both these regions, as well as the outer segment of photoreceptor (ph), are significantly thinner in mdx mice compared to wt at P 5, and similar between the two genotypes at later, more mature, ages. We, therefore, hypothesized a delay, and/or an unbalance, in the initial steps of retina differentiation (characterized by a highly predetermined cell body migration along the retina Y axis) in the mdx genotype compared to control. Successively, we analysed, the distribution of Hoechst stained nuclei in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) and in the GCL, and the acquisition of differentiated chemical phenotypes, by immunolabeling for cell specific markers: calretinin (retinal ganglion cells-RGCs), PKC-α (bipolar cells-BCs) and calbindin (horizontal cells-HCs). Quantitative analysis of the number of differentiated cells/mm, disclosed early differences (between P 0 and P 10) in the number of nuclei in the GCL and IPL, as well as in the number of immunopositive RGCs, HCs and BCs, in mdx mouse retina compared to wt. We also investigated the onset of ribbon synapse formation, the tripartite synaptic structure established among phs, BCs and HCs, by immunolabeling for its specific marker VGluT 1. At a first analysis, timing of formation was similar between the two genotypes and gross abnormalities were not revealed by simple immunofluorescence analysis. However, some difference in the quality of immunolabeling observed suggests that fine ultrastructural alteration may exist between wt and mdx mice, which will deserved a deeper analysis by electron microscopy. One of the major hallmarks of retina development is the temporary establishment, at early post-natal dates (P 0 -P 15), of a large cholinergic circuit between starburst amacrine cells and RGCs, the spontaneous cholinergic activity of which is fundamental for correct retinal differentiation and layering. We previously demonstrated that, in the SCG, Dp 427 is involved in the stabilization and activity of α 3 β 2 /β 4 -nAChRs. In the retina a number of different nAChR has been identified, among which receptors containing α 3, β 2, β 4 and α 7 subunits. We, therefore, began to investigate for possible differences in the protein levels of these subunits at early post-natal dates (P 0, P 5, and P 10). The obtained results indicate a temporary, but significant, reduction in the expression of α 3, β 4 and α 7 subunits in mdx mouse retina respect to wt. Finally, a RNA seq analysis revealed the presence of genes that were differently modulated between the two genotypes at P 5. In particular, 9 genes were up-regulated in mdx mice respect to wt and verified by real time RT-PCR. Among these, genes encoding proteins involved in the rescue of cells by apoptotic cell death, in the protection from erroneously folded proteins, in cell signalling and development. Only one of the down-regulated genes, Erdr 1, was confirmed by real time. Interestingly, up-regulated genes were exclusive of the ciliary margin, the most anterior part of retina, source of retinal staminal cells. These data argue in favor of a role of the sole Dp 427 in final stages of early post-natal differentiation of those retinal neurons expressing Dp 427, possibly regulating the correct structural and functional (e. g. intracellular signaling) connection between cell cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix...|$|E
