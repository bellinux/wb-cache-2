5|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, the O Street Market had once more become dilapidated. The {{structure}} fell into disrepair, trash collected around the building, many vendors were squatters without leases, {{and drug dealers}} and gang members loitered nearby, driving customers away. The building's owner <b>fell</b> <b>behind</b> on tax payments, and the city threatened to place a lien on the building and foreclose.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being the}} {{dominant}} presence in Scottish brewing for around a century, the McEwan's brands were neglected by Scottish & Newcastle, who concentrated on their global brands. The McEwan's ales were eclipsed by John Smith's Bitter and Belhaven Best and cask-conditioned beers such as Deuchars IPA, whilst the lager <b>fell</b> <b>behind</b> Tennent's.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, I do {{know the}} hall. It stands upon a low ridge--what we call a knowe--with the big <b>fells</b> <b>behind</b> and the sands in front. At low-water, a river winds about the flats. It's a fine old house, {{although}} it's small." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{highest point}} of the fell is {{difficult}} to ascertain as there are two tops of very similar height marked by cairns. The view from the top is not extensive {{but there is a}} good prospect of Borrowdale with the higher <b>fells</b> <b>behind.</b>|$|R

5|$|At Hanford, top {{priority}} was initially {{given to the}} installations in the 300 area. This contained buildings for testing materials, preparing uranium, and assembling and calibrating instrumentation. One of the buildings housed the canning equipment for the uranium slugs, while another contained a small test reactor. Notwithstanding the high priority allocated to it, work on the 300 area <b>fell</b> <b>behind</b> schedule due to the unique and complex nature of the 300 area facilities, and wartime shortages of labor and materials.|$|E

5|$|Kumbakonam {{continued}} to grow even after India's independence though it <b>fell</b> <b>behind</b> {{the nearby town of}} Thanjavur in terms of population and administrative importance. The population growth rate began to fall sharply after 1981. This decline has been attributed to limited land area and lack of industrial potential. During the Mahamaham festival of 1992, there was a major stampede in which 48 people were killed and 74 were injured. On July 16, 2004, a devastating fire accident in the Sri Krishna school killed 94 children.|$|E
25|$|The main {{face of the}} fell {{stands over}} Thirlmere Dam, and appears from there as a sheer 500ft crag, the higher <b>fells</b> <b>behind</b> being hidden by the ridge. Raven Crag is most {{commonly}} climbed from the dam, via a steep waymarked path through the forestry. This ends with made paths and some short sections of boardwalk. The ridge between Raven Crag and High Tove can also be gained from Armboth, or an ascent {{can be made from}} 'behind' via Shoulthwaite. This can include visits to The Benn and the earth ramparts of Castle Crag.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{one evening}} when the hay was {{harvested}} and the corn was ripening, his satisfaction was rudely banished. Grace {{had gone to}} the lodge with a message and stopped for a few minutes by the gate. The evening was calm and one side of the placid tarn glittered in the light; the other was dark, and soft blue shadows covered the <b>fells</b> <b>behind.</b> She heard the languid splash of ripples on the stones and the murmur of a beck in a distant ghyll. A strange restful tranquillity brooded over the dale.|$|R

5|$|After Kapoor's {{design for}} the {{sculpture}} was selected during a design competition, numerous technological concerns regarding the design's construction and assembly arose, in addition to concerns regarding the sculpture's upkeep and maintenance. Experts were consulted, some of whom believed the design could not be implemented. Eventually, a feasible method was found, but the sculpture's construction <b>fell</b> <b>behind</b> schedule. Cloud Gate was unveiled in an incomplete form during the Millennium Park grand opening celebration, as the grid of welds around each metal panel was still visible. The sculpture was concealed again while it was completed; in early 2005, workers polished out the seams. Cloud Gate was formally dedicated on May 15, 2006, and it has since gained considerable popularity, both domestically and internationally.|$|E
