5|$|The {{chances of}} staying free of disease (<b>disease-free</b> survival) and of staying alive (overall survival) are similar for LDR, PDR and HDR treatments.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} of conserving B.brownii in its present disease-exposed locations, it is an especially suitable candidate for ex situ conservation measures, such as the cold-storage of seed, and the translocation of plants to <b>disease-free</b> locations. Seed of B.brownii has been collected by Western Australia's Threatened Flora Seed Centre, and placed in cold-storage both in Perth and at Kew's Millennium Seed Bank. This includes seed collected from populations that have since become extinct. In 2008, some of this seed was germinated, and seedlings were planted at a location near Albany. Genetic analysis of the seedlings revealed some genetic diversity that was not present in any extant population. The conservation of these seeds had thus preserved some of the species' genetic diversity that would otherwise have been lost through population extinction, providing a powerful example of the importance of seed banking to conservation efforts. A seed orchard was planted in 2007, and by 2010 this had yielded over 400 <b>disease-free,</b> healthy plants, some of which had grown {{more than three times the}} rate of those in the wild. A 2007 seedling flowered for the first time at Wakehurst Place in February 2011.|$|E
5|$|Embryos {{produced}} {{using in}} vitro fertilization may be genetically tested for HD using preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). This technique, where one or two cells are extracted from a typically 4- to 8-cell embryo and then tested for the genetic abnormality, can then be used to ensure embryos affected with HD genes are not implanted, and therefore any offspring will not inherit the disease. Some forms of preimplantation genetic diagnosis—non-disclosure or exclusion testing—allow at-risk people to have HD-free offspring without revealing their own parental genotype, giving no information about whether they themselves are destined to develop HD. In exclusion testing, the embryos' DNA is {{compared with that of}} the parents and grandparents to avoid inheritance of the chromosomal region containing the HD gene from the affected grandparent. In non-disclosure testing, only <b>disease-free</b> embryos are replaced in the uterus while the parental genotype and hence parental risk for HD are never disclosed.|$|E
5|$|Regarding incidence, cohort {{longitudinal}} studies (studies where a <b>disease-free</b> population is followed over the years) provide rates between 10 and 15 per thousand person–years for all dementias and 5–8 for AD, {{which means that}} half of new dementia cases each year are AD. Advancing age is a primary risk factor for the disease and incidence rates are not equal for all ages: every {{five years after the}} age of 65, the risk of acquiring the disease approximately doubles, increasing from 3 to as much as 69 per thousand person years. There are also sex differences in the incidence rates, women having a higher risk of developing AD particularly in the population older than 85. The risk of dying from Alzheimer's disease is 26% higher among the non-Hispanic white population than among the non-Hispanic black population, whereas the Hispanic population has a 30% lower risk than the non-Hispanic white population.|$|E
5|$|Spielberg used doves for the seagulls that Henry scares into {{striking}} the German plane because the real gulls {{used in the}} first take did not fly. In December 1988, Lucasfilm ordered 1,000 <b>disease-free</b> gray rats for the catacombs scenes from the company that supplied the snakes and bugs for the previous films. Within five months, 5,000 rats had been bred for the sequence; 1,000 mechanical rats stood in for those that were set on fire. Several thousand snakes of five breeds—including a boa constrictor—were used for the train scene, in addition to rubber ones onto which Phoenix could fall. The snakes would slither from their crates, requiring the crew to dig through sawdust after filming to find and return them. Two lions were used, which became nervous because of the rocking motion and flickering lights.|$|E
5|$|With current treatments, {{patients}} with low and intermediate risk disease {{have an excellent}} prognosis with cure rates above 90% for low risk and 70–90% for intermediate risk. In contrast, therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma {{the past two decades}} resulted in cures only about 30% of the time. The addition of antibody therapy has raised survival rates for high-risk disease significantly. In March 2009 an early analysis of a Children's Oncology Group (COG) study with 226 high-risk patients showed that two years after stem cell transplant 66% of the group randomized to receive ch14.18 antibody with GM-CSF and IL-2 were alive and <b>disease-free</b> compared to only 46% in the group that did not receive the antibody. The randomization was stopped so all patients enrolling on the trial will receive the antibody therapy.|$|E
25|$|Consolidation {{chemotherapy}} {{is given}} after remission {{in order to}} prolong the overall <b>disease-free</b> time and improve overall survival. The drug that is administered {{is the same as}} the drug that achieved remission.|$|E
25|$|Another study {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} adding cetuximab to conventional chemotherapy (cisplatin) versus cisplatin alone. This study found no improvement in survival or <b>disease-free</b> survival {{with the addition of}} cetuximab to the conventional chemotherapy.|$|E
25|$|A ban on feeding {{meat and}} bone meal to cattle has {{resulted}} in a strong reduction in cases in countries where the disease was present. In <b>disease-free</b> countries, control relies on import control, feeding regulations, and surveillance measures.|$|E
25|$|The Cochrane {{review of}} {{surgical}} removal versus retention of asymptomatic <b>disease-free</b> impacted wisdom teeth {{suggests that the}} presence of asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth may be associated with increased risk of periodontal disease affecting adjacent 2nd molar (measured by distal probing depth > 4mm on that tooth) in the long term, however it is of very low quality evidence and high risk of bias. Another study which was at high risk of bias, found no evidence to suggest that removal of asymptomatic <b>disease-free</b> impacted wisdom teeth has an effect on crowding in the dental arch. There is also insufficient evidence to highlight a difference in risk of decay with or without impacted wisdom tooth.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} from a prospective study that job-related burnout, controlling for traditional risk factors, such as smoking and hypertension, {{increases the risk}} of coronary heart disease {{over the course of the}} next three and a half years in workers who were initially <b>disease-free.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many {{impacted}} wisdom {{teeth are}} extracted {{prior to the}} age of 25, when full eruption can be reasonably expected and before symptoms or disease have begun. This has led to a treatment controversy generally referred to as the extraction of asymptomatic, <b>disease-free</b> wisdom teeth.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no known}} {{cure for the}} disease, and {{intensive}} research is underway to determine its cause. There is also a captive breeding program being undertaken by the Tasmanian government to establish a <b>disease-free,</b> genetically diverse population of Tasmanian devils outside Tasmania. This has been relatively successful so far.|$|E
25|$|Wisdom {{teeth that}} are fully erupted and in normal {{function}} need no special attention {{and should be}} treated {{just like any other}} tooth. It is more challenging, however to make treatment decisions with asymptomatic, <b>disease-free</b> wisdom teeth, i.e. wisdom teeth that have no communication to the mouth and no evidence of clinical or radiographic disease (see Treatment controversy below).|$|E
25|$|Kangaroo Island {{is noted}} for its honey and its Ligurian honey bees. The island has the world's only {{pure-bred}} and <b>disease-free</b> population {{of this type of}} bee. The exporting of pure-bred queen bees is a notable industry for the island. For this reason there are significant quarantine restrictions on bringing bee products and bee-handling equipment onto the island.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{sufficient}} evidence to determine whether such teeth should be removed or not, the patient's preference and values should be taken into account with clinical expertise exercised and careful consideration of risks & benefits to determine treatment. If it is decided to retain asymptomatic <b>disease-free</b> impacted wisdom teeth, clinical assessment at regular intervals is advisable to prevent undesirable outcomes (pericoronitis, root resorption, cyst formation, tumour formation, inflammation/infection).|$|E
25|$|One {{trial in}} {{adolescents}} who had orthodontic treatment comparing {{the removal of}} impacted mandibular wisdom teeth with retention was identified. It only examined the effect on late lower incisor crowding and was rated 'highly biased' by the authors. The authors concluded {{that there is not}} enough evidence to support either the routine removal or retention of asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth. Another randomised controlled trial done in the UK has suggested that it is not reasonable to remove asymptomatic <b>disease-free</b> impacted wisdom tooth merely to prevent incisor crowding as there is not strong enough evidence to show this association.|$|E
25|$|Treatment with {{docetaxel}} increasing {{survival time}} {{in people with}} certain types of cancer. While some clinical trials show median survival times to be increased by approximately only three months, the range of survival time is large. Many people survive beyond five years with treatment from docetaxel, however {{it is difficult to}} attribute these findings directly to treatment with docetaxel. Improved median survival time and response indicates that docetaxel slows metastatic cancer progression and can lead to <b>disease-free</b> survival. Conjunctive treatment of prednisone with docetaxel has been shown to lead to improved survival rate as well as improved quality of life and reduction of pain compared with treatments with mitoxantrone.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who argue}} against a blanket {{moratorium}} on the extraction of asymptomatic, <b>disease-free</b> wisdom teeth point out that wisdom teeth commonly develop periodontal disease or cavities which may eventually damage the second molars {{and that there are}} costs associated with monitoring wisdom teeth. They also point {{to the fact that there}} is an increase in the rate of post-operative periodontal disease on the second molar, difficulty of surgery and post-operative recovery time with age. The UK has also seen an increase in the rate of dental caries on the lower second molars increasing from 4–5% prior to the NICE guideline to 19% after its adoption.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, only 300 wood bison {{remained}} worldwide, {{almost exclusively in}} Wood Buffalo National Park. During the 1920s, 6000-7000 plains bison were also relocated to Wood Buffalo National Park. These bison were not only infected with brucellosis and tuberculosis, which infected the wood bison herd, but the wood and plains subspecies also interbred, and thus {{it was thought that}} wood bison were completely extinct by the 1940s. In 1957, however, a <b>disease-free,</b> wood bison herd of 200 was discovered near Nyarling river in Wood Buffalo National Park. In 1965, 23 of these bison were relocated to the south side of Elk Island National Park and remain there today as the most genetically pure wood bison remaining. In 2007, the wood bison population in Elk Island National Park was estimated at 315.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, {{the first}} National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) of the United Kingdom set {{guidelines}} {{to limit the}} removal of asymptomatic <b>disease-free</b> third molars citing the number of pathology free impacted teeth being removed and the potential cost savings to the public purse. Advocates of the policy {{point out that the}} impacted wisdom teeth can be monitored and avoidance of surgery also means avoidance of the recovery, risks, complications and costs associated with it. Following implementation of the NICE guidelines the UK saw a {{decrease in the number of}} impacted third molar operations between 2000 and 2006 and a rise in the average age at extraction from 25 to 31 years. American Public Health Association has adopted a similar policy against removal of third molars before any problems have occurred.|$|E
25|$|Prognosis {{is usually}} {{given for the}} {{probability}} of progression-free survival (PFS) or <b>disease-free</b> survival (DFS). These predictions are based on experience with breast cancer patients with similar classification. A prognosis is an estimate, as patients with the same classification will survive a different amount of time, and classifications are not always precise. Survival is usually calculated as an average number of months (or years) that 50% of patients survive, or the percentage of patients that are alive after 1, 5, 15, and 20 years. Prognosis is important for treatment decisions because patients with a good prognosis are usually offered less invasive treatments, such as lumpectomy and radiation or hormone therapy, while patients with poor prognosis are usually offered more aggressive treatment, such as more extensive mastectomy and one or more chemotherapy drugs.|$|E
25|$|Mucocutaneous {{leishmaniasis}} is {{very difficult}} to treat. Treatment involves the use of pentavalent antimonial compounds, which are highly toxic (common side effects include thrombophlebitis, pancreatitis, cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity) and not very effective. For example, in one study, despite treatment with high doses of sodium stibogluconate for 28 days, only 30% of patients remained <b>disease-free</b> at 12 months follow-up. Even in those patients who achieve an apparent cure, as many as 19% will relapse. Several drug combinations with immunomodulators have been tested, for example, a combination of pentoxifylline (inhibitor of TNF-α) and a pentavalent antimonial at a high dose for 30 days in a small-scale (23 patients) randomised placebo-controlled study from Brazil achieved cure rates of 90% and reduced time to cure, a result that should be interpreted cautiously in light of inherent limitations of small-scale studies. In an earlier small-scale (12 patients) study, addition of imiquimod showed promising results which need yet to be confirmed in larger trials.|$|E
25|$|Infection {{resulting}} from impacted wisdom teeth can be initially treated with antibiotics, local debridement or soft tissue surgery of the gum tissue overlying the tooth. Over time, {{most of these}} treatments tend to fail and patients develop recurrent symptoms. The most common treatment is wisdom tooth removal. The risks of wisdom tooth removal are roughly proportional {{to the difficulty of}} the extraction. Sometimes, when there is a high risk to the inferior alveolar nerve, only the crown of the tooth will be removed (intentionally leaving the roots) in a procedure called a coronectomy. The long-term risk of coronectomy is that chronic infection can persist from the tooth remnants. The prognosis for the second molar is good following the wisdom teeth removal with the likelihood of bone loss after surgery increased when the extractions are completed in people who are 25 years of age or older. A treatment controversy exists about the need for and timing of the removal of <b>disease-free</b> impacted wisdom teeth that are not causing problems. Supporters of early removal cite the increasing risks for extraction over time and the costs of monitoring the wisdom teeth that are not removed. Supporters for retaining wisdom teeth cite the risk and cost of unnecessary surgery.|$|E
25|$|Ovarian cancer {{frequently}} recurs after treatment. Overall, in a 5-year period, 20% {{of stage}} I and II cancers recur. Most recurrences {{are in the}} abdomen. If a recurrence occurs in advanced disease, it typically occurs within 18 months of initial treatment (18 months progression-free survival). Recurrences can be treated, but the <b>disease-free</b> interval tends to shorten and chemoresistance increases with each recurrence. When a dysgerminoma recurs, it {{is most likely to}} recur within a year of diagnosis, and other malignant germ cell tumors recur within 2 years 90% of the time. Germ cell tumors other than dysgerminomas have a poor prognosis when they relapse, with a 10% long-term survival rate. Low malignant potential tumors rarely relapse, even when fertility-sparing surgery is the treatment of choice. 15% of LMP tumors relapse after unilateral surgery in the previously unaffected ovary, and they are typically easily treated with surgery. More advanced tumors may take up to 20 years to relapse, if they relapse at all, and are only treated with surgery unless the tumor has changed its histological characteristics or grown very quickly. In these cases, and when there is significant ascites, chemotherapy may also be used. Relapse is usually indicated by rising CA-125 levels and then progresses to symptomatic relapse within 2–6 months. Recurrent sex cord-stromal tumors are typically unresponsive to treatment but not aggressive.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy {{also has}} a role, {{combined}} with radiation, in the postoperative setting (adjuvant therapy). Generally it is used where the pathology of the resected specimen indicates features associated with high risk of locoregional recurrence (e.g. extracapsular extension through involved lymph nodes or very close margins). It has shown improved <b>disease-free</b> survival and locoregional control in two very similar clinical trials in such high risk patients, EORTC 22931 (1994–2000) and RTOG 9501 (1995–2000). However, for HPV+OPC patients, such extracapsular spread {{does not appear to}} be an adverse factor and the addition of chemotherapy to radiation in this group provided no further advantage. Since the sample size to detect a survival advantage is large, given the small number of events in this group, these studies may have been underpowered and the question of the utility of adding chemotherapy is being addressed in a randomized clinical trial (ADEPT) with two year locoregional control and disease free survival as the endpoint. The addition of chemotherapy to radiation increases acute and late toxicity. In the GORTEC trial, chemotherapy with docetaxel provided improved survival and locoregional control in locally advanced OPC, but was associated with increased mucositis and need for feeding by gastrostomy. Chemotherapy and radiation are associated with a risk of death of 3–4% in this context. It is unclear whether the added toxicity of adding chemotherapy to radiation is offset by significant clinical benefit in disease control and survival.|$|E
500|$|By May 2007 the {{construction}} of all 31 Beijing-based Olympic Games venues had begun. The Chinese government renovated and constructed six venues outside Beijing as well as 59 training centres. The largest structures built were the Beijing National Stadium, Beijing National Indoor Stadium, Beijing National Aquatics Center, Olympic Green Convention Center, Olympic Green, and Beijing Wukesong Culture & Sports Center. Almost 85% of {{the construction}} budget for the six main venues was funded by $2.1billion (RMB¥17.4billion) in corporate bids and tenders. Investments were expected from corporations seeking ownership rights after the Olympics. Some events were held outside Beijing, namely football in Qinhuangdao, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Tianjin; sailing in Qingdao; and, because of the [...] "uncertainties of equine diseases and major difficulties in establishing a <b>disease-free</b> zone", the equestrian events were held in Hong Kong.|$|E
2500|$|FMD occurs {{throughout}} much of the world, and while some countries have been free of FMD for some time, its wide host range and rapid spread represent cause for international concern. After World War II, the disease was widely distributed throughout the world. In 1996, endemic areas included Asia, Africa, and parts of South America; as of August 2007, Chile is <b>disease-free,</b> and Uruguay and Argentina have not had an outbreak since 2001. In May 2014, the FAO informed that Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru were [...] "just one step away" [...] from eradication; North America and Australia have been free of FMD for many years. New Zealand has never had a case of foot-and-mouth disease. Most European countries have been recognized as <b>disease-free,</b> and countries belonging to the European Union have stopped FMD vaccination.|$|E
2500|$|More than 95% of new {{patients}} are treated well {{or at least}} adequately by cladribine or pentostatin. [...] A majority of {{new patients}} can expect a <b>disease-free</b> remission time span of about ten years, or sometimes much longer after taking one of these drugs just once. [...] If re-treatment is necessary in the future, the drugs are normally effective again, although {{the average length of}} remission is somewhat shorter in subsequent treatments.|$|E
2500|$|Multiple {{retrospective}} analyses {{have demonstrated}} that overall survival and <b>disease-free</b> survival outcomes are similar between radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation therapy, and brachytherapy. [...] Rates for impotence when comparing radiation to nerve-sparing surgery are similar. [...] Radiation has lower rates of incontinence compared with surgery, but has higher rates of occasional mild rectal bleeding. Men who have undergone external beam radiation therapy may have a slightly higher risk of later developing colon cancer and bladder cancer.|$|E
2500|$|Rottweilers are a {{relatively}} healthy, <b>disease-free</b> breed. As with most large breeds, hip dysplasia {{can be a}} problem. For this reason the various Rottweiler breed clubs have had x-ray testing regimes in place for many years. Osteochondritis dissecans, a condition affecting the shoulder joints, {{can also be a}} problem due to the breed's rapid growth rate. [...] A reputable breeder will have the hips and elbows of all breeding stock x-rayed and read by a recognised specialist, and will have paperwork to prove it.|$|E
2500|$|Prevention of pericoronitis can be {{achieved}} by removing impacted third molars before they erupt into the mouth, or through preemptive operculectomy. [...] A treatment controversy exists about the necessity and timing of the removal of asymptomatic, <b>disease-free</b> impacted wisdom teeth which prevents pericoronitis. Proponents of early extraction cite the cumulative risk for extraction over time, the high probability that wisdom teeth will eventually decay or develop gum disease and costs of monitoring to retained wisdom teeth. Advocates for retaining wisdom teeth cite the risk and costs of unnecessary operations and the ability to monitor the disease through clinical exam and radiographs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{management}} of sugarcane smut is done {{through the use}} of resistant cultivars, fungicide and using disease free planting stock. [...] Control is mainly accomplished {{through the use of}} resistant cultivars in areas where the disease is present. [...] Fungicides also are used in the control of this disease, but typically resistant cultivars are preferred due to the cost of fungicides. [...] In areas where this disease is not yet found it is important to use <b>disease-free</b> planting stock so as not to introduce the pathogen. Important regulations are sometimes implemented by governments to help prevent the spread of the disease. Quarantines are also implemented in areas that are infected.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{there was a}} debate on the {{outbreak}} of tuberculosis and brucellosis at Wood Buffalo Park discussing whether the diseased bison should be replaced. A committee was established in 1986 to discuss the possibilities of action and suggested: [...] "maintenance of the status quo, fencing of the park boundary, a combination of fences and buffer zones near the park boundary and the complete eradication of the hybridized park bison with replacement by a <b>disease-free</b> herd of wood bison." [...] This caused a debate between Environment Canada, who was in favour of the eradication, and Wood Buffalo National Park staff, who opposed it. The park staff argued {{that the risk of}} the diseased bison infecting cattle was overstated and that it was to justify using the bison for commercial purposes. Due to the opposition the diseased bison were not slaughtered.|$|E
2500|$|Liver {{transplantation}} {{to replace}} the diseased liver with a cadaveric liver or a living donor graft has historically low survival rates (20%-36%). During 1996–2001 the rate had improved to 61.1%, likely related to adoption of the Milan criteria at US transplantation centers. Expanded Shanghai criteria in China resulted in overall survival and <b>disease-free</b> survival rates similar to the Milan criteria. Studies from the late 2000 obtained higher survival rates ranging from 67% to 91%. If the liver tumor has metastasized, the immuno-suppressant post-transplant drugs decrease the chance of survival. Considering this objective risk {{in conjunction with the}} potentially high rate of survival, some recent studies conclude that: [...] "LTx can be a curative approach for patients with advanced HCC without extrahepatic metastasis". For those reasons, and others, it is considered nowadays that patient selection is a major key for success.|$|E
2500|$|The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), has {{identified}} {{the emergence of}} antibiotic resistance as a national threat. The concern over antibiotic use in livestock arises from the necessity antibiotics have in keeping populations <b>disease-free.</b> As of 2016, over 70 percent of FDA approved antibiotics are utilized in modern, high production poultry farms to prevent, control, and treat disease. The FDA released a report in 2009 estimating that 29 million pounds of antibiotics {{had been used in}} livestock in that year alone. [...] However, surveillance of consumer exposure to antibiotics through poultry consumption is limited. More specifically in 2012, the FDA speculated the most significant public health threat in regard to antimicrobial use in animals is the exposure of antimicrobial resistant bacteria to humans. [...] These statements are challenged by the American meat industry lobbyists that antibiotics are used responsibly and judiciously in order to ensure effectiveness.|$|E
