30|$|For this purpose, the meta-model defines an {{abstraction}} called design part. Design parts can be hierarchical and requirements can be allocated to them. A requirement can {{have one of}} the three visibilities {{from the point of view}} of a design part: internal, external, and interface. Internal means that requirement is implementation-dependent and comes from the inside of the design part development. This is also called a white box requirement. External requirement comes from the outside. This is a requirement that the environment of the design part requires. This is also called a black box requirement. <b>Interface</b> <b>requirement</b> concerns the interface of the design part.

40|$|Information {{technology}} plays {{a supportive}} role in knowledge management. It captures and stores knowledge into knowledge repositories. At the same time, it also improves access to knowledge stored in knowledge repositories. The codification strategy in knowledge management (Hansen, et al., 1999) and the capturing functionality {{of information technology}} have made more and more knowledge repositories available. However, the utility of a knowledge repository may largely depend on how information is presented and requested through its interfaces. The <b>interface</b> <b>requirement</b> of a knowledge repository varies with the content of knowledge and the media type in which the repository stores the knowledge. The dissertation {{provides an example of}} selecting appropriate information visualization and analysis technology to facilitate effective knowledge retrieval from different types of knowledge repository. It identifies four types of knowledge repository, each of which has unique requirements for its interfaces. The dissertation applies various visualization technologies to fulfill such requirements. The interfaces developed facilitate the knowledge retrieval by helping in the specification of information needs or by supporting users' information browsing behavior. In addition, the dissertation also presents four empirical studies evaluating the systems developed. Since the lack of evaluation studies in the field of information visualization has become an issue, such empirical studies also provide examples of approaches to evaluating different aspects of an interface...|$|E
40|$|Most {{failures}} {{occur at}} interfaces between organizations and hardware. Processing <b>interface</b> <b>requirements</b> {{at the start}} of a project life cycle will reduce the likelihood of costly interface changes/failures later.

40|$|Effective user {{interface}} {{is an important}} component to the success of an interactive system as any of the components that manage the underlying functionality of the system. The development of an effective {{user interface}}s highly depends {{on the quality of the}} requirements where the end-user should be actively involved. Therefore, there is a need to accurately capture, interpret, and represent the voice of the end-user when specifying the user <b>interface</b> <b>requirements.</b> The objective of the thesis is to advance the state of the art in bridging the gap between specifying the User <b>Interface</b> <b>Requirements</b> for interactive systems on the one hand and the design and development of it on the other hand. Towards this objective, a software framework called SUCRE (acronym for Scenario and Use-Case based Requirements Engineering) was developed as a part of this thesis work. Use Case Maps (UCMs) that were introduced in the literature were examined and have been enriched with new visual notation for modeling and specifying the user <b>interface</b> <b>requirements.</b> This enriched UCM for User Interface (UCM-UI) model formed a basis for SUCRE. Thus, scenarios and use cases are used as a means to represent the user <b>interface</b> <b>requirements</b> and communicate with end-users. In addition, the thesis explores two other objectives, namely validation of user <b>interface</b> <b>requirements</b> and usability prediction of the intended user interface. SUCRE was used to build operators that validate the consistency, completeness, and precision of the UCM-UI model using heuristics for constructing a formal analysis of the requirements. SUCRE was also used to define a metrics suite to predict usability from scenarios and use cases. This metrics suite includes simple structural measures as well as content-sensitive and task-sensitive metrics. Considering the difficulties in the specification and design of user interfaces, the thesis aimed also to identify the need for a mix of both informal and formal representation in specifying user <b>interface</b> <b>requirements.</b> Therefore, SUCRE was successfully used to bridge the gap between the semi-formal requirement UCM-UI and detailed formal requirements such as UML, LOTOS specifications, and XML...|$|R

30|$|The {{controller}} module {{is composed}} of coprocessor and main controller to monitor the analog signal and digital signal of the sensor and to control {{the operation of the}} motor. The coprocessor uses a series of Macro STC 12 C 2052 AD single-chip computers, including CPU SRAM and flash, 15 common I/O ports with 8 -bit precision ADC. The speed of the ADC conversion is as high as 250 Â k/s. The controller module, as the primary processing module of the level signal, can send the processed level signal to the PLC master controller in the way of switch quantity. The main controller adopts the Japanese Mitsubishi PLC controller, FX 3 U- 32 M, 32 I/O input and output points; supports the RS 485 interface; and meets the communication <b>interface</b> <b>requirement</b> of the whole system. The memory capacity of RAM is 64 Â kg/basic instruction and the processing speed is 0.065 Â Î¼s. It supports the function of three-axis linkage positioning. The driving motor selected is Wade DS series servo motor. The specific model is 60 ST-M 00630, and the model of the servo driver is the Wade WD- 15 B 020 A driver. According to the working steps of the conveying system, the automatic conveying system of vegetable bowl and seedling needs to control the continuous coordination of three motors, and the controller can meet the control requirements. The monitoring data of all kinds of sensors are transmitted through I/O to the main controller of PLC, and the PLC controller communicates with the microcomputer through the RS 485 interface to realize the function of system monitoring and man-machine interaction [16].

40|$|The problem {{addressed}} in this research {{is the need for}} supervisory or system summary displays for the Advanced Tomahawk Weapons Control System (ATWCS). These displays are needed to accurately depict the current system state and weapon status in order to aid strike supervisory personnel in making correct and timely decisions. This research examined the problem in the context of designing a set of graphical displays that extracts information relevant to the strike supervisor from ATWCS and displays it in a manner that allows both rapid and accurate interpretation. The approach used to solve the problem progressed in four distinct phases. The first phase, Requirements Analysis, consisted of gathering system requirements through interviews with U. S. Navy officers who have experience as strike warfare supervisors. In the second phase, an initial design was produced using Century Computing's rapid prototyping tool TAE Plus Workbench(TM). The third phase involved the heuristic and guideline evaluation of the prototype based on accepted user interface design principles and ATWCS user <b>interface</b> <b>requirement</b> specifications. This evaluation produced a second iteration prototype that was used in the final phase, Usability Testing. The prototype was tested by U. S. Navy Officers with Tomahawk strike experience and test results were recorded. Changes were then made to the prototype to correct usability problems discovered by the user testing, yielding a third iteration prototype. The final result of this research is a set of prototype displays, in both paper and TAE Plus Workbench(TM) resource file formats, that will be provided to Naval Command, Control, and Ocean Surveillance Center (NCCOSC) Research, Development, Test and Evaluation Division (NRaD) for consideration during system design and implementation.
