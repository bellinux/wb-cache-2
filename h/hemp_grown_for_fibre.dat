Alkali treated fibres, polypropylene and a maleated polypropylene (MAPP) coupling agent were compounded in a twin-screw extruder, and injection moulded into composite tensile test specimens.

[...] "Until the early 1900s industrial hemp was a valuable crop used {{all over the world}} for its strong fibers and oil seeds. Today, however, the common perception of the industrial hemp plant is generally negative and associated with the drug marijuana.

Ideally, according to Britain's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the herb should be desiccated and harvested towards the end of flowering.

40|$|Plants are {{the major}} source of <b>fibres</b> <b>for,</b> e. g., textile and paper applications. Fibre hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) can be grown under a wide variety of agro-ecological conditions, is {{resistant}} to weeds and pests and, in general, drought tolerant. Fibre length and content of cellulose and lignin are important quality parameters for raw material used in cordage, textile, paper, and fibreboard industries. To improve currently used hemp varieties, more knowledge about the molecular processes that underlie cell wall metabolism is needed. To study gene expression in hemp, separate cDNA libraries were constructed from developing core fibres and developing and near mature bast fibres. A cDNA microarray was constructed with 3414 randomly selected hemp cDNAs. From these a total number of 1571 sequences was obtained from the 50 ends of the cDNAs. After similarity search, 1036 unique contigs were obtained. To study differences in the genetic background of quality properties of bast and core fibres, bast and core tissues were obtained from middle parts of the stems during various developmental stages and expression of the cDNAs was analyzed. A total number of 178 clones encoding 65 proteins was found to be more highly expressed in core tissue. Most of these 65 proteins are involved in C 1 metabolism and lignin biosynthesis. In bast tissue, a total number of 110 clones encoding 44 proteins was more highly expressed. Among these 44 proteins are arabinogalactan proteins, lipid transfer proteins, lipoxygenases, and endoxyloglucan transferases. This paper describes the identification of genes that are differentially expressed in bast fibres and wooden core tissue of hemp, and {{is the first step in}} linking the genetic background to quality differences between these two types of hemp tissue.

An experiment on modern flax seeds, carbonised at different temperatures, was used to expand current knowledge about how flax seeds change through the carbonisation process and why flax seeds are so rarely preserved in prehistoric contexts.

40|$|Linseed, one of {{the oldest}} {{cultivated}} crops, is again gaining in importance, mainly due to its nutritional benefits and biomedical applications. Therefore, it is expected that herbivores will also exist in greater abundance. Among them the flea beetle, Aphthona euphorbiae Schrank and Longitarsus parvulus Paykull are considered to be serious pests of flax <b>grown</b> <b>for</b> <b>fibre</b> and seeds in Europe. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine flax flea beetles’ abundance, species richness and seasonal dynamics on linseed grown at different densities. It was expected that linseed seeding density can significantly affect flea beetle populations. The experiment was carried out in Lower Silesia, Poland, from 2011 to 2013. A genetically modified type of linseed overproducing flavonoids was used. Flea beetles and the damages they caused were determined on plants and also a sweep net was used for the collection of adult beetles. During the three years of the study 15 species of flea beetles were identified from oil flax plants, with A. euphorbiae and L. parvulus being dominant. In terms of the total catch, the tendency was for beetle numbers to decrease with increasing plant density. Flax flea beetles feeding on linseed plants, irrespective of plant density, had two peaks of abundance. The first peak was lower and occurred in June, when plants were at the blooming stage. This peak was caused by overwintering adults who colonized crops in spring. The second, higher peak of abundance was recorded in the second half of July, when plants were at the ripening stage. This peak was formed by adults of the new generation. Each year, at the higher population peak of abundance, the flea beetles were most numerous on plants grown at the lowest density. There was one period, lasting either from mid-May to the first few days of June, or from the beginning of June to mid-June, during which the number of holes and damage on plants of each treatment were highest. During the three years of the study there were several cases of significantly higher numbers of flea beetle feeding symptoms on plants grown at the lowest density as compared to the medium and highest densities...|$|R

Two naturally regenerated jack pine stands, 17 - and 32 -years old, were selected for study near Thunder Bay, Ontario, in each stand, one sample plot was established at each of three density levels. Each sample plot consisted of 15 live jack pine trees. In all, 90 trees were felled in September 1978 and analyzed to determine the above ground distribution of biomass by foliage, cone, stem wood, stem bark, live branch wood, live branch bark, and dead branch (wood plus bark) components. Total current annual wood production was determined by adding the periodic annual increment of the stem {{for the last three years}} to the mean annual increment of the live branches. Stand density was determined by computing number of stems per hectare, relative spacing, and basal area. Stem wood, stem bark, foliage and dead branch biomass increased with density in both stands. Live branch wood, live branch bark, and cone biomass were not affected by stand density and age. Total current annual Wood production was closely related to the foliage dry weight supported by individual trees; stand density and age seemed to have no influence on this relationship. Total current annual wood production per hectare was linearly related to foliage dry weight and stand density. It was concluded that within the range of densities sampled, the two jack pine stands do not give any indication of being over-crowded.

Larvae of the midge feed beneath leaf sheaths and the crop lodges in late summer. Details are given on the biology of the midge.

The dry matter yields declined markedly and were after three years of midge-attack about 50 % of the average yield in the preceding years. The yield dropped comparatively more when the crop was harvested in the spring as opposed to harvest in late autumn and more at a nitrogen fertilisation at 100 kg compared to 200 kg N ha 1 per year. The effect of midge attack on fibre quality was studied.
