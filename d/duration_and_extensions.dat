One required the FBI director to personally sign off on any request for library and bookstore records before applying to the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, but it was altered in the United States Senate version of the bill. Two of his amendments were signed into law and they subjected any National Security Letter and its gag order to a judicial challenge by the recipient, and narrowed the scope of [...] "Sneak and Peek" [...] warrants to have definite time limits on their <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> <b>extensions</b> before they need to notify {{the target of the}} investigation. Before that, [...] "Sneak and Peek" [...] warrants could be extended by the standard of not [...] "unduly delaying trial" [...] without any defined time limitation.

This bill also required three Inspector General investigations that led to the discovery of exigent letters and National Security Letter abuses.|$|E

40|$|Ulcerative colitis is {{associated}} with an increased risk for colorectal cancer. The increase is approximately six to ten times the expected in the general population. Disease <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> <b>extension</b> are the major risk factors. Concomitant primary sclerosing cholangitis is an additional independent risk factor. The relative risk is approximately 14. 8 for patients with pancolitis while it is 1. 7 for patients with disease restricted to the rectum. The risk increases rapidly after 20 years of disease evolution. Active treatment might decrease the risk. The increased cancer risk is a major problem for longterm management of patients with ulcerative colitis. It is the rationale for various surveillance programs and the search for dysplasia. Two major types of dysplasia must be distinguished in ulcerative colitis: sporadic adenomas and ulcerative colitis-associated dysplasia. Sporadic adenomas can be treated by simple polypectomy. The diagnosis of dypsplasia relies mainly on microscopic analysis of biopsy samples. Additional techniques, including flow cytometry and the search for DNA abnormalities and immunohistochemistry or molecular techniques looking for genetic defects can help to improve the diagnostic yield. status: publishe...|$|R

We demonstrate a strong connection between the bulk rheological properties of Europe's lithosphere and the evolution of some of Europe's main rifts and back-arc systems.

30|$|The {{scaffolding}} {{and knowledge}} base {{associated with it}} that allows learners to place historical knowledge in correct periods and contexts is called a “frame of reference” or “historical overview knowledge” (van Boxtel and van Drie 2012). It {{has been suggested that}} the students’ knowledge on which such scaffoldings are based should contain chronologically ordered key concepts, so that key concepts can act as landmarks for navigating in the historical landscape. The most useful key concepts which act as landmarks are supposedly related to phenomena of long duration or very important events or ideas. Examples of such key concepts are, for example, the Scientific Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, the Enlightenment and the Reformation. Such concepts colligate many facts of persons, events, ideas or inventions and group them into meaningful sub-clusters, subordinated to the key concepts. This motivates referring to these key concepts as colligatory concepts (van Boxtel and van Drie 2012), which are the most important and luminous landmarks in the historical landscape.

MRA was combined with standard magnetic resonance image (MRI) acquisition in the image-guided planning for the microsurgical clipping of a saccular aneurysm in two patients (one 3 -mm large middle cerebral artery and one 8 -mm large pericallosal artery aneurysm, diagnosed by catheter angiography in both patients) using two different neurosurgical navigation systems. Conventional 3 -D T 1 -weighted MRI with gadolinium and MRA pulse sequences were acquired in frameless stereotactic conditions the day before surgery and thereafter registered, allowing the definition a minimally invasive straight trajectory to the aneurysm neck. MRA-guided neurosurgery allowed a direct approach to the aneurysms at their proper location, reducing the invasiveness of the approach by tailoring the bone opening <b>and</b> reducing the <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> <b>extension</b> of brain retraction. The technique also avoided unnecessary dissection and exposure of the main trunks and collateral vessels. The aneurysms were successfully eradicated without complication.

In the last ten years new trends in radiation therapy have been developing with a new planning of <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> <b>extension</b> of breast tissue to irradiate. Moreover some authors presented the idea of combining the use of intraoperatory radiotherapy with the partial breast irradiation, with the aim of irradiate the breast in a single session during breast conserving surgery. From September 2009 to July 2010 we prospectively enrolled 13 patients to undergo electron beam intraoperative radiotherapy after breast conservative treatment for early breast cancer. At a mean follow-up of 46 months no local recurrences have been described and no patients presented distant metastasis or died for any cause. 6 patients (46. 2 %) presented complications, as fibrosis and liponecrosis. Our results suggest that electron beam intraoperative radiotherapy in the conservative treatment of breast cancer could be considered a suitable option for low risk patients, even if our sample is very small and we need longer follow-up to draw conclusive results...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Dermoscopy of {{granuloma}} annulare {{has been investigated}} by several studies, {{but none of them}} took into account the variability of dermoscopic findings according to clinical characteristics and/or histological subtype. OBJECTIVE: To describe the dermoscopic features of classic {{granuloma annulare}} and seek possible dermoscopic clues related to specific clinical findings/histological subpatterns. METHODS: A representative dermoscopic image of a target lesion (the most active lesion underwent histological examination) was retrospectively assessed for the presence of specific morphological findings, correlating them with clinical variables, i. e. disease <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> <b>extension</b> (localized or generalized) and clinical aspect (annular or non-annular) and localization (trunk or extremities) of the biopsied lesion, and with histological subtype. RESULTS: A total of 25 lesions from 25 subjects were analysed; an "interstitial" histological variant was detected in 11 cases, while a "palisading granuloma" histological pattern was found in 14 instances. The most common dermoscopic findings included blurry vessels having variable appearance (dotted, linear-irregular, and branching) over a more or less evident pinkish-reddish background, followed by whitish and/or yellowish-orange areas. Additional findings were rosettes, crystalline structures, and whitish scaling. No difference (p > 0. 05) in the frequency of dermoscopic features according to clinical findings was found, while we observed a strict association (p < 0. 001) between the presence of yellowish-orange structureless areas on dermoscopy and "palisading granuloma" histology. CONCLUSION: The dermoscopic aspect of granuloma annulare is independent from clinical features but varies according to histological subtype, with the detection of yellowish-orange colour being indicative of the "palisading granuloma" variant...|$|R

However, the <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> <b>extension</b> of associated anatomical changes have rarely been analysed thoroughly. A total of 18 young European ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) trees injured on the stem by a spring flood were sampled with the aim of comparing earlywood vessels and rays formed prior to and after the scarring event. Anatomical and hydraulic parameters were measured in five successive rings over one-quarter of the stem circumference. The results demonstrate that mechanical damage induces a decrease in vessel lumen size (up to 77 %) and an increase in vessel number (up to 475 %) and ray number (up to 115 %). The presence of more earlywood vessels and rays was observed over at least three years after stem scarring. By contrast, abnormally narrow earlywood vessels mainly developed in the first ring formed after the event, increasing the thickness-to-span ratio of vessels by 94 % and reducing both xylem relative conductivity and the index for xylem vulnerability to cavitation by 54 % and 32 %, respectively. These vessels accumulated in radial groups in a 30 ° sector immediately adjacent to the wound, raising the vessel grouping index by 28 %. The wound-induced anatomical changes in wood structure express the functional need of trees to improve xylem hydraulic safety and mechanical strength at the expense of water transport. Xylem hydraulic efficiency was restored in one year, while xylem mechanical reinforcement and resistance to cavitation and decay lasted over several year...|$|R

Using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), this study evaluates the spatio-temporal variability in climatological drought dynamics (in terms of intensity, frequency, <b>duration,</b> <b>and</b> <b>extension)</b> in Finland in 1962 – 2011. The SPEI values are calculated in 12 -, 3 -, and 1 -month time steps (SPEI- 12, - 3, and - 1, respectively) and the analyses are based on annual (SPEI- 12 Ann), seasonal (e. g. SPEI- 3 Win for winter), and monthly (e. g. SPEI- 1 Dec for December) time scales. The relationships between SPEI values and well-known ACPs of climate variability over Finland are also investigated. Our analysis shows that on national scale, the longest observed drought is 12 [*]months (October 2002 –September 2003) observed in SPEI- 12 values. Droughts intensify in April, August, and September, and largely occur over the south, centre, east, and west of Finland. December has the highest frequency of droughts, but with significant wetting trends. Analysis of annual SPEI- 12 indicates {{an increase in the}} probability of drought extent over time. In warm months (April–September), influential ACPs for temperature variability and drought conditions are mainly the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and the Scandinavia pattern. For the cold months (October–March), the AO, the North Atlantic Oscillation, the East Atlantic, and the Polar patterns influence precipitation deficit and SPEI. Although Finland has experienced wetting trends during the period 1962 – 2011, this study provides a detailed spatial assessment of climatological drought variability and the plausible atmospheric circulation drivers for the boreal environment of Finland in recent decades...|$|R
60|$|It will, perhaps, give us {{a little}} further light into the idea we have of infinity, and {{discover}} to us, that it is NOTHING BUT THE INFINITY OF NUMBER APPLIED TO DETERMINATE PARTS, OF WHICH WE HAVE IN OUR MINDS THE DISTINCT IDEAS, if we consider that number is not generally thought by us infinite, whereas <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> <b>extension</b> are apt to be so; which arises from hence,--that in number we are at one end, as it were: for there being in number nothing LESS than an unit, we there stop, and are at an end; but in addition, or increase of number, we can set no bounds: and so it is like a line, whereof one end terminating with us, the other is extended still forwards, beyond all that we can conceive. But in space <b>and</b> <b>duration</b> it is otherwise. For in duration we consider it as if this line of number were extended BOTH ways--to an unconceivable, undeterminate, and infinite length; which is evident to anyone that will but reflect on what consideration he hath of Eternity; which, I suppose, will find to be nothing else but the turning this infinity of number both ways, a parte ante and a parte post, as they speak. For, when we would consider eternity, a parte ante, what do we but, beginning from ourselves and the present time we are in, repeat in our minds ideas of years, or ages, or any other assignable portion of duration past, with a prospect of proceeding in such addition with all the infinity of number: and when we would consider eternity, a parte post, we just after the same rate begin from ourselves, and reckon by multiplied periods yet to come, still extending that line of number as before. And these two being put together, are that infinite duration we call ETERNITY which, as we turn our view either way, forwards or backward appears infinite, because we still turn that way the infinite end of number, i.e. the power still of adding more.|$|R
60|$|FIRST, Time {{in general}} is {{commonly}} taken for so much of infinite duration as is measured by, and co-existent with, the existence and motions of the great bodies of the universe, {{as far as we}} know anything of them: and in this sense time begins and ends with the frame of this sensible world, as in these phrases before mentioned, 'Before all time,' or, 'When time shall be no more.' Place likewise is taken sometimes for that portion of infinite space which is possessed by and comprehended within the material world; and is thereby distinguished from the rest of expansion; though this may be more properly called extension than place. Within these two are confined, and by the observable parts of them are measured and determined, the particular time or <b>duration,</b> <b>and</b> the particular <b>extension</b> <b>and</b> place, of all corporeal beings.|$|R
60|$|Hence I {{think we}} may learn the reason why every one familiarly and without the least {{hesitation}} speaks of and supposes Eternity, and sticks not to ascribe INFINITY to DURATION; but it is with more doubting and reserve that many admit or suppose the INFINITY OF SPACE. The reason whereof {{seems to me to}} be this,--That <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> <b>extension</b> being used as names of affections belonging to other beings, we easily conceive in God infinite <b>duration,</b> <b>and</b> we cannot avoid doing so: but, not attributing to him extension, but only to matter, which is finite, we are apter to doubt of the existence of expansion without matter; of which alone we commonly suppose it an attribute. And, therefore, when men pursue their thoughts of space, they are apt to stop at the confines of body: as if space were there at an end too, and reached no further. Or if their ideas, upon consideration, carry them further, yet they term what is beyond the limits of the universe, imaginary space: as if IT were nothing, because there is no body existing in it. Whereas duration, antecedent to all body, and to the motions which it is measured by, they never term imaginary: because it is never supposed void of some other real existence. And if the names of things may at all direct our thoughts towards the original of men's ideas, (as I am apt to think they may very much,) one may have occasion to think by the name DURATION, that the continuation of existence, with a kind of resistance to any destructive force, and the continuation of solidity (which is apt to be confounded with, and if we will look into the minute anatomical parts of matter, is little different from, hardness) were thought to have some analogy, and gave occasion to words so near of kin as durare and durum esse. And that durare is applied to the idea of hardness, as well as that of existence, we see in Horace, Epod. xvi. ferro duravit secula. But, be that as it will, this is certain, that whoever pursues his own thoughts, will find them sometimes launch out beyond the extent of body, into the infinity of space or expansion; the idea whereof is distinct and separate from body and all other things: which may, (to those who please,) be a subject of further meditation.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To use {{description}} logics (DLs) in an application, {{it is crucial}} to identify a DL that is sufficiently expressive to represent the relevant notions of the application domain, but for which reasoning is still decidable. Two means of expressivity that are required by many modern applications of DLs are concrete domains and general TBoxes. The former are used for defining concepts based on concrete qualities of their instances such as the weight, age, <b>duration,</b> <b>and</b> spatial <b>extension.</b> The purpose of the latter is to capture background knowledge by stating that the extension of a concept is included in the extension of another concept. Unfortunately, it is wellknown that combining concrete domains with general TBoxes often leads to DLs for which reasoning is undecidable. In this paper, we identify a general property of concrete domains that is sufficient for proving decidability of DLs with both concrete domains and general TBoxes. We exhibit some useful concrete domains, most notably a spatial one based on the RCC- 8 relations, which have this property.

Methods: A systematic search of the literature published in English from 1995 to 2010 was conducted using PubMed to identify all reports of port-site, trocar-site, or incisional hernia following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Studies in over 100 patients were identified before the application of defined exclusion criteria. The incidence of port-site hernia was calculated and compared with historical data.

The overall incidence of port-site hernia was 1. 7 % (range, 0. 3 % to 5. 4). The most important factors were older age, higher body mass index, preexisting hernia, trocar design, trocar diameter, increased <b>duration</b> of surgery, <b>and</b> <b>extension</b> of the port site for gallbladder extraction. Conclusion: The incidence of port-site hernia is low but likely to be underestimated and has not declined over time. Awareness of the predisposing factors and modification of techniques may help to reduce the risk...|$|R
40|$|While {{several studies}} have {{documented}} kinematic and precipitation structures associated with orographic effects in large-scale mountains (e. g. altitudes 3 ̆e 1. 0 km MSL), surveys on small-scale mountains are still relatively rare. Given their lower altitude, these mountain are usually exposed to rain (instead of snow) during the approaching of baroclinic waves and concomitant warm and cold fronts, thus they are prone to flash floods and hydrological disasters during heavy rain episodes. One factor that influence kinematic and precipitation structures over mountain ranges is associated with airflows induced by the terrain itself, such as during low-level blocking and gap flow episodes. Force balance make these airflows move relatively parallel and {{in close proximity to}} the terrain, thus they can be categorized as terrain-trapped airflows (TTAs). TTAs can cause the lifting of incoming synoptic airflows upstream the terrains foothills, initiating and enhancing precipitation well before it would be observed by upslope forcing over the terrain. TTAs and orographic precipitation forcing along the small-scale coastal mountains of northern California have been studied from a 1 -dimensional perspective; yet, details of the TTAs 3 -dimensional kinematic and precipitation structure, especially in the lowest 500 -m MSL, has not being addressed. In this doctoral thesis I examine physical characteristics and impacts of TTAs on orographic precipitation along the coastal mountains of northern California using a 13 -winter season dataset. Selected case studies are employed to document in detail 3 -dimensional kinematic and precipitation structures associated with pre-cold-frontal low-level jets (LLJs) and TTAs. The main observational asset is a ground-based X-band dual-polarization scanning Doppler radar located at the coast. Results show that TTAs are normally present during winter time, although with variable <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> offshore <b>extension.</b> In average, they account for 20...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} media {{synchronization}} quality of recovery control schemes from asynchrony, which {{are referred to}} as reactive control schemes here, in terms of objective and subjective measures. We deal with four reactive control techniques: skipping, discarding, shortening <b>and</b> <b>extension</b> of output <b>duration,</b> <b>and</b> virtual-time contraction and expansion. We have carried out subjective and objective assessment of the media synchronization quality of nine schemes which consist of combinations of the four techniques. The paper makes a comparison of media synchronization quality among the schemes. It also clarifies the relations between the two kinds of quality measures...|$|R

We estimate the effects on unemployment <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> post unemployment wages. Two main changes are considered: the modification {{in the scheme of}} payments —from a lump sum during six months to a decreasing system of payments during the same period— <b>and</b> <b>extension</b> in the <b>duration</b> of the benefit up to one year for workers 50 or older. We consider different impact evaluation techniques (propensity score, difference in differences and regression discontinuity), and find that the change in the paymentscheme has implied a small reduction in unemployment duration, withno effects in terms of subsequent earnings. The possibility of extension of the unemployment insurance for older workers has led to an <b>extension</b> in unemployment <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> it has not helped to subsidize better job matches in the form of better paying jobs...|$|R
