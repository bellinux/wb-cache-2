50|$|Galvanization {{consists}} of an application on the object to be protected of a layer of metallic zinc by either hot-dip galvanizing or <b>electroplating.</b> <b>Zinc</b> is traditionally used because it is cheap, adheres well to steel, and provides cathodic protection to the steel surface in case of damage of the zinc layer. In more corrosive environments (such as salt water), cadmium plating is preferred. Galvanization often fails at seams, holes, and joints where there are gaps in the coating. In these cases, the coating still provides some partial cathodic protection to iron, by acting as a galvanic anode and corroding itself instead of the underlying protected metal. The protective zinc layer is consumed by this action, and thus galvanization provides protection only for a limited period of time.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Chromate {{conversion}} coating {{is an important}} surface finishing process for <b>electroplated</b> <b>zinc</b> coatings that are widely employed in automotive applications. In addition to providing enhanced corrosion protection, the {{conversion coating}} offers a shade of colors to the coated products, both for aesthetic and functional benefits.

This effectively poses the requirement of the fundamental understanding on how the keys processing parameters of trivalent chromate conversion coating may relate to coloring of the coating products. In this work, for the first time, a systematic study is carried out to correlate the electroplating parameters, including the current density and electrolyte’s additives, on the formation of the trivalent chromate conversion coating, and hence the color appearance of the top-coats. Focusing on the black conversion coating, the color and optical properties are analyzed using a colorimeter and an optical spectrometer. The results notably show that, while the additives highly influence the observable shade of blackness, current density affects the optical properties in the visual spectrums.

40|$|Low alloyed high {{strength}} steels are increasingly {{used in many}} industry sectors to reduce weight and, hence, to save fuel, reduce emissions, and to minimize resource utilization. Those alloys show, however, a tendency for hydrogen induced cracking (HAC), where the hydrogen is formed either during processing or due to service corrosion processes. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the impact of various zinc-containing topcoats on hydrogen re-embrittlement. In order to cause hydrogen induced cracking, hydrogen does not only need to be formed, but also needs to penetrate and migrate into the material. The hydrogen entry is influenced by various parameters, e. g. temperature, electrostatic potential, humidity, pH-value, oxygen concentration, chloride and promoter concentration, and time. In this study, the influence of different environmental conditions on the hydrogen induced corrosion was investigated by means of electrochemical permeation measurements. The electrochemical permeation measurements were performed under different concentrations of the local oxygen content (5 % NaCl; pH = 3; flushing with different gases). For these chosen environmental conditions, the results show that the local oxygen content has a significant influence on the resulting permeation current. To validate the results of the electrochemical permeation measurements and to examine the susceptibility against hydrogen re-embrittlement of those zinc containing topcoats, incremental step-load-tests were performed under the same environmental conditions. It is shown that the investigated topcoats (<b>electroplated</b> <b>zinc,</b> electroplated zinc-nickel, galvanized zinc, zinc-flake (GEOMET 321 A)) impose a different susceptibility on hydrogen re-embrittlement.

40|$|<b>Electroplated</b> <b>zinc</b> alloys {{can provide}} {{increased}} corrosion protection for automotive body panels compared with zinc coatings of similar thickness. As a result, their use is becoming widespread. In particular, outstanding {{results have been}} reported in the literature for the corrosion resistance of zinc-manganese, and the alloys are said to offer good paintability, weldability and formability. However, the production of zinc-manganese coatings is restricted by the instability of the sulphate-citrate bath from which the alloy is usually deposited. The solution deteriorates rapidly and precipitates appear in the bath. The aim of this research was to investigate both the process of alloy deposition from the sulphate-citrate bath and the solution instability. The electrodeposition of zinc-manganese was assessed in terms of the polarisation behaviour of the system, in order to determine the role of the bath components and the operating parameters in the deposition process. The coatings were analysed using scanning electron microscopy, and the efficiency of metal deposition was established. The sodium citrate complexant was not found to significantly move the deposition potentials of zinc and manganese together. Instead, its action as a buffer can be used to explain metal deposition and the polarisation behaviour of the system. The sodium citrate suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction, such that manganese can be deposited from the electrolyte. The bath deterioration with time and the resulting precipitate were examined using a variety of chemical techniques including spectroscopic methods, namely ultraviolet and visible, atomic absorption and infrared. Bath discolouration and precipitation were found to be two separate phenomena. The precipitate was determined to be a citrate of known composition with a ratio of Mn 2 + ions to Zn 2 + ions of 2 : 1. The formation took several days, and it was precipitated once the solubility limit in the bath was exceeded. Solution discolouration resulted from reactions occurring after the oxidation of Mn 2 + ions and could be delayed by the use of antioxidants...|$|E

However, the spontaneous formation of whiskers on zinc electroplated components, which are capable of resulting in electrical shorting or other damaging effects, can be highly problematic for the reliability of long life electrical and electronic equipment. To date, most research has focused on tin whiskers and much less attention has been paid to zinc whisker research. A number of mechanisms to explain zinc whisker growth have been proposed, but none of them are widely accepted and some are in conflict with each other. This study has investigated the mechanism for whisker growth from three commercial zinc electroplated coatings on mild steel substrates. Firstly, whisker growth from an alkaline cyanide-free zinc electrodeposit was studied. A reduction in deposition current density (from 50 to 5 mA/cm 2) and an increase in deposit thickness (from 2 to 15 μm) both contributed to reduced whisker growth. In terms of the mechanisms of whisker growth, it was observed that the presence of spherical raised surface features (nodules) with cavities beneath, promoted whisker growth by markedly shortening the incubation time from 5 months to 4 weeks. More importantly, the time dependent recrystallisation of the as-deposited columnar structure is closely associated with whisker growth from both nodules and planar regions of the deposit. The formation of Fe-Zn intermetallic compounds (IMCs) was not observed at either the Fe/Zn interface or within the electroplated coatings and does not appear to be associated with Zn whisker growth. Whisker growth from an acid chloride zinc electroplated coating and a Zn-Ni alloy electroplated coating were also investigated. These two coatings were immune to whisker growth after 18 months of storage at room temperature, regardless of deposition current density, deposit thickness and substrate surface modification. Finally, the effect of potential mitigation strategies on whisker growth was evaluated. Exposure to elevated temperatures (50 to 150 °C) for 24 hours promoted whisker growth by reducing the incubation time for whiskers to first appear from less than 4 weeks to less than 10 days, whilst whisker growth was significantly retarded when samples were subjected to a short period of thermal treatment (50 to 150 °C) for 0. 5 hour. More importantly, for a short period of thermal treatment, whisker mitigation became increasingly effective as the treatment temperature was raised. In addition, the formation of a trivalent chromium passive coating on the alkaline cyanide-free zinc electrodeposits immediately after deposition was not an effective mitigation method to retard whisker growth...|$|E
