25|$|Kicking straps / boom vangs, which {{control a}} boom-footed sail's leech tension by exerting {{downward}} force mid-boom. Normally {{this is a}} system of highly geared blocks, of flexible stainless steel wire and low stretch cordage but recently some sail boats have a short spar instead, often of carbon fibre. When sailing downwind the <b>kicking</b> <b>strap</b> (kicker) is tensioned to stop the boom lifting.|$|E
5000|$|The term <b>kicking</b> <b>strap</b> is {{normally}} shortened to [...] "kicker" [...] whilst sailing, e.g. [...] "Hard on the kicker {{when we get}} to the leeward mark".|$|E
50|$|The vang or <b>kicking</b> <b>strap</b> {{which runs}} between a point partway along the boom and {{the base of}} the mast, and is used to haul the boom down when on a run.|$|E
50|$|On one occasion, at {{the mothers}} request he beat Ellen. Elsewhere, overseers would beat {{children}} using rods and leather <b>straps.</b> <b>kick</b> them and slap {{them around the}} head with their fists.|$|R
5000|$|The Hilbre One Design Association {{was formed}} in 1960 to {{preserve}} the one design principles, which were threatened {{by the use of}} seven different boat builders who constructed the majority of the 55 strong class within a 3-year period each offering a list of extras to suit the prospective owners needs. However most of these concerned the interior layout and did not affect the sailing performance. For example the Williams & Nixon boats tend to have a far flatter cuddy compared to the other builders and it is reputed the only boats that strictly comply with the approved plans in full are the two Partington Boats (H47 & H53). Various improvements and adaptations have been incorporated into the rules over time including allowing <b>kicking</b> <b>straps</b> etc. The Hilbre One Design Association endeavours to keep boats sailing locally and currently owns two boats, Hiraethog (H32) and Hi-C (H46). The Association are now attempting to locate all [...] "lost" [...] boats with various Hilbres being found in gardens and one apparently being the possession of West Cheshire Sailing Club's Commodore. There is a view to obtain some of these boats and refurbish one per year. The plan of the Association is to make a boat a year available for sale or possible lease to sailors who want to sail and race on the Dee.|$|R
50|$|Mainsail {{controls}} {{permitted by}} the class are downhaul (Cunningham), outhaul and <b>kicking</b> <b>strap</b> (Vang). The Jib tack fixing {{may also be}} adjustable while sailing allowing changes in jib luff tension and tack height.|$|E
50|$|He also popularised the <b>kicking</b> <b>strap,</b> or {{boom vang}} (US). This {{may take the}} form of a block and tackle linking a low point on the mast (or an {{equivalent}} point on the hull) and the boom close to the mast, which allows the boom to be let out when reaching or running without lifting. This controls the twist of the mainsail from its foot to its head, increasing the sail's power and the boat's speed and controlability. Elvstrøm did not advertise his new invention, leaving his competitors mystified at his superior boat-speed. Investigation of his dinghy revealed nothing as he used to remove the <b>kicking</b> <b>strap</b> before coming ashore.|$|E
50|$|Again, {{while the}} {{original}} Hyde sails are still competitive, North Sails now offer a cheaper alternative using the latest cloth technology. The centre-sheeting optionally via a deck-mounted jammer or directly ‘off-the-boom’ may include a centre or an aft bridle, and a compression-strut kicker (‘Gnav’) is allowed {{which gives the}} crew much more space than the conventional <b>kicking</b> <b>strap.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Kicking straps / boom vangs, which {{control a}} boom-footed sail's leech tension by exerting {{downward}} force mid-boom. Normally {{this is a}} system of highly geared blocks, of flexible stainless steel wire and low stretch cordage but recently some sail boats have a short spar instead, often of carbon fibre. When sailing downwind the <b>kicking</b> <b>strap</b> (kicker) is tensioned to stop the boom lifting.|$|E
5000|$|The boom vang, <b>kicking</b> <b>strap</b> or kicker is an {{intricate}} set of pulleys (and, on yachts, a hydraulic ram) running diagonally between the boom {{and the lower}} portion of the mast. The kicker pulls the boom downwards. When the boat is running away from the wind the sheet will be fully eased and so the kicker becomes the primary means of controlling sail twist.|$|E
5000|$|A {{boom vang}} (US) or <b>kicking</b> <b>strap</b> (UK) {{is a line}} or piston system on a {{sailboat}} used to exert downward force on the boom and thus control {{the shape of the}} sail.The Collins English Dictionary defines it as [...] "A rope or tackle extended from the boom of a fore-and-aft mainsail to a deck fitting of a vessel when running, {{in order to keep the}} boom from riding up".|$|E
50|$|An {{aluminium}} mast and boom {{are used}} to set a bermuda rig of mainsail and jib. To keep things simple, the jib sheets lead to fixed fairleads and cam-cleats, the mainsail is loose-footed, and the mainsheet leads to a rope horse across the transom. ClamCleats may be present to allow this mainsheet traveller to be adjusted. The standard mainsail has three fibreglass battens, and can be shaped using a <b>kicking</b> <b>strap</b> and Cunningham.|$|E
50|$|The key to {{stopping}} or rescuing a broach is to depower {{the sails}} {{at the first}} opportunity. This may be done by releasing the main or jib sheet by a foot or more or by releasing the boom vang (<b>kicking</b> <b>strap)</b> which will spill wind {{out of the top}} of the mainsail. The main means of preventing a broach is to ensure that the amount of sail set is reduced to suit the sailing conditions.|$|E
50|$|A safe jibe can be {{aided by}} {{tensioning}} the boom vang (<b>kicking</b> <b>strap)</b> {{to prevent the}} boom from lifting. In fresh winds, sailing nearly directly downwind briefly {{before and after the}} jibe and making only a small direction changes will produce less heeling force and reduce the tendency to round-up. In heavier gusts, the crew or skipper can sheet the boom in and force the boom across the boat by hand, holding the boom in position by locking the traveler or using a preventer. After the jibe has been completed, the course can then be changed to higher points of sail.|$|E
50|$|A Chinese gybe on a {{sailing vessel}} {{is a type}} of gybe where the upper section of the main sail moves across the boat, filling from the {{opposite}} side, whilst the lower section and boom remain on the original side of the vessel. It contrasts with a normal gybe, where the whole sail moves across the boat as the boat turns its stern through the wind. A Chinese gybe is usually induced by too little tension on the vang or <b>kicking</b> <b>strap,</b> allowing the boom to rise up and the leech of the sail to twist excessively.|$|E
50|$|The Laser 4000 was {{designed}} in 1994 by yacht designer Phil Morrison. It is a sloop rigged dinghy constructed from fiberglass. It features a single trapeze {{as well as}} an open, self-draining cockpit. Instead of a conventional <b>kicking</b> <b>strap</b> it features a gnav system, which pushes down on the boom from the top, instead of pulling from the bottom. This allows greater space for the crew to move from side to side.Boat manufacture is well known to be of a very high quality and durability, thus hulls from the very first molds are still competing effectively.|$|E
50|$|A fitter {{casualty}} may climb {{a ladder}} {{more or less}} unaided, although the dangers of approaching {{the stern of the}} boat in a rough sea should be considered if that is where the only useful ladder is. A fitter casualty {{may be able to get}} a foot onto a simple loop of rope and lift themselves to the rail. A hypothermic, injured or unconscious victim may be quite incapable of helping themselves. In this case netting, slings, an inflatable dinghy or liferaft may be employed, with or without the additional assistance of a 4:1 or better tackle. Such a tackle may be fashioned from a mainsheet, a boom vang (<b>kicking</b> <b>strap),</b> or may be purpose-made for the job and stored in case needed. The yacht's winches may also be of assistance.|$|E
50|$|The mast {{on current}} boats uses {{externally}} run rigging to enable their being sealed and thus buoyant, reducing any tendency {{for the boat}} to invert in a capsize. Other innovations introduced with the boats included a centrally mounted bowsprit, a compression-strut kicker or Gnav {{in place of the}} conventional <b>kicking</b> <b>strap</b> or boom vang, and ‘off-the-boom’ sheeting with a take-off block at mid-boom fed from an aft bridle. The latter two rigging variations give considerably more room in the boat for the crew members, and remove any objections levelled at the original boats of being cramped due to their centre-bridle and conventional kicker. The class rules permit all variations introduced since the original Laser 3000 to be retro-fitted to existing boats, which can generally be done with minimal trouble or expense.|$|E
