60|$|Early in July, the {{movement}} began. Day after day, fleets of boats and canoes rowed up Lake Champlain, and, {{towards the end}} of the month, the whole force was gathered at Ticonderoga. <b>Here</b> <b>were</b> <b>now</b> collected eight thousand men, of whom two thousand were Indians, representing forty-one tribes and sub-tribes: among them were Iroquois, Hurons, Nipissings, Abenakis, Algonkins, Micmacs, and Malecites. These were all nominal Christians, and counted eight hundred warriors. With them were the western Indians: Ojibwas, Mississagas, Pottawattamies, Menomonies, Sacs, Foxes, Winnebagoes, Miamis, and Iowas. These were still unconverted.|$|E
60|$|Venn {{soon after}} went away, {{and in the}} evening Yeobright strolled as far as Fairway's cottage. It was a lovely May sunset, and the birch trees which grew on this margin of the vast Egdon {{wilderness}} had put on their new leaves, delicate as butterflies' wings, and diaphanous as amber. Beside Fairway's dwelling was an open space recessed from the road, and <b>here</b> <b>were</b> <b>now</b> collected all the young people from within a radius {{of a couple of}} miles. The pole lay with one end supported on a trestle, and women were engaged in wreathing it from the top downwards with wildflowers. The instincts of merry England lingered on here with exceptional vitality, and the symbolic customs which tradition has attached to each season of the year were yet a reality on Egdon. Indeed, the impulses of all such outlandish hamlets are pagan still: in these spots homage to nature, self-adoration, frantic gaieties, fragments of Teutonic rites to divinities whose names are forgotten, seem in some way or other to have survived mediaeval doctrine.|$|E
5000|$|By 1840 <b>here</b> <b>were</b> <b>now</b> 3 Wesleyan Missions in the area, WAIHARAKEKE {{the site}} of the first Wesleyan Mission Station -established by John Whiteley in April 1835.(Te Waitere)Kawhia, Raglan 1839 and now Te Kopua 1840 but not one with the Ngāti Te Wehi at Aotea Harbor.So at around the time of signing the Treaty Kawhia Hōne Waitere Te Aotūroa Rangatira of Ngāti Te Wehi, Hapu Ngāti Paiaka of Aotea Harbor lovingly persuaded Rev. John Bumby the Superintendent of the Wesleyan Church to set up a Misson in AOTEA HARBOUR, site of the landing of the Aotea Canoe and of an ancient Pa. On the {{northern}} side 844 acres were gifted to the Wesleyans for a boys’ school and mission station & the non-maori speaking Rev H.Hansen.Turton was re-appointed to that area. In 1843 Rev. Gideon Smales was appointed to replace Rev Turton. Smales raised funding for the mission station, travelling extensively to do so & 95% of contributions were from maori. On 29 January 1844 Gideon Smales landed at Raoraokauere on the northern side of the Aotea Harbour and proceeded to build his mission - which he called BEECHAMDALE. So a farm & school had been established growing wheat [...] "In 1844, they reaped throughout the Circuit not more than twenty acres of wheat...in 1845, about eighty...in 1846, one hundred and fifty...and this year they will reap about two hundred acres of wheat besides a small patch of oats, and another of barley.|$|E
