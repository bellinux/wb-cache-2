40|$|Partial order {{planning}} {{is an important}} approach that solves planning problems without completely specifying the orderings between the actions <b>in</b> the <b>plan.</b> This property provides greater flexibility in executing plans; hence making the partial order planners a preferred choice over other <b>planning</b> methodologies. However, <b>in</b> order to find partially ordered plans, partial order planners perform a search <b>in</b> <b>plan</b> space rather than in space of world states and an uninformed search <b>in</b> <b>plan</b> space leads to poor efficiency. In this thesis, I discuss applying a reinforcement learning method, called First-visit Monte Carlo method, to partial order <b>planning</b> <b>in</b> order to design agents which do not need any training data or heuristics but are still able to make informed decisions <b>in</b> <b>plan</b> space based on experience. Communicating effectively with the agent is crucial in reinforcement learning.
