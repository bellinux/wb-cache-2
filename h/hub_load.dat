40|$|The aeromechanics {{design of}} the Active Elevon Rotor (AER) has been completed. The AER elevon is a 15 % chord, plain, trailing-edge flap {{actuated}} by a piezoceramic-based conformal actuator. A trade study is performed to determine {{the location of the}} elevon for reducing the (4 /rev) vibratory <b>hub</b> <b>loads</b> at µ = 0. 125. Both single- and dual-elevon configurations are considered, with the dual-elevon configuration being selected.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This work explores a {{feasibility}} of using vibratory hub loads and {{support vector machine}} (SVM) to predict damage and hence the life consumption of the composite helicopter rotor blade. Generally, the initial part of the composite’s life is dominated by matrix cracking; the intermediate part by debonding/delamination and the final failure due to fiber breakage. The simulated hub loads under various damage levels are obtained using a comprehensive aeroelastic analysis of the composite rotor blade with physics based damage modes and are then linked with the life consumption of the blade using a phenomenological model. The SVM is used for classification of the useful life of the blade into three classes which are useful to decide the prognostic action. The performance of the blade damage detection system is demonstrated using simulated hub loads obtained using a two-cell airfoil section representing the stiff-inplane blade. The model based <b>hub</b> <b>load</b> variations are contaminated with noise to simulate the real data.

A case study is conducted for a modern articulated helicopter main rotor. Correlation of vibratory pitch link loads with wind tunnel test data is satisfactory for lower harmonics. Inclusion of unsteady aerodynamics had little effect on the correlation. In the absence of pushrod damping, reduction in pushrod stiffness from the baseline value had an adverse effect on vibratory <b>hub</b> <b>loads</b> in forward flight.

Also, a root-based device may allow for the retrofitting of existing helicopter rotor blade/hub configurations...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{of local and}} global controllers is conducted for helicopter vibration reduction using actively controlled single/dual trailing-edge flaps. It is found that for high-speed flight conditions, both local and global controllers perform equally well. However, for low-speed flight, local controller gives a marginally better optimal solution compared to the global controller but {{at the cost of}} much greater computation time. An objective function containing the hub vibratory loads is minimized using the global controller. The control effort is weighted such that each flap is used to complete authority. A reduction of 73 % and 75 % in hub vibration is obtained at high-speed flight using single and dual flap configurations, respectively. At low-speed flight, single and dual flap configurations gave 52 % and 63 % reduction in vibration, respectively. Numerical studies using an aeroelastic simulation show that the vibration control system performs well up to +/- 5 degrees error in flap phasing from optimal phase. The control law is insensitive to small perturbations (up to +/- 0. 3 deg) in the optimal flap harmonics and is fairly insensitive to stiffness and mass changes of the rotor blade as well as noise in the measured <b>hub</b> <b>load</b> data. Dual flap configuration was found to be more insensitive to errors in optimal flap control harmonics than single flap configuration...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of {{spatially}} uncertain material properties of composite helicopter rotors on vibratory <b>hub</b> <b>load</b> predictions. The flap, lag and torsional stiffnesses of the rotor blades are considered to vary spatially along the axis of the rotor blades. The spatial uncertainty analysis is performed with rotors modeled as both isotropic rotors and dissimilar rotor systems. In isotropic rotor systems, the uncertainty {{is considered to be}} similar for all of the four blades and the uncertainty effects on the 4 /rev vibratory hub loads are studied. To reduce the computational expense of uncertainty analysis, a high dimensional model representation (HDMR) method is developed to approximate the vibratory loads as functions of blade stiffness properties modeled as random fields. In the HDMR formulation, a KarhunenLoève expansion and a low order expansion are used to represent the input and outputs, respectively. Monte Carlo simulations are then performed with the developed HDMR models. The proposed approach decouples the computationally expensive aeroelastic simulations of uncertainty analysis. MCS, performed with computationally less expensive HDMR models, shows that spatial uncertainty has considerable influence on the 4 /rev vibratory hub loads. In the uncertainty analysis of dissimilar rotor systems, the spatial uncertainty of each blade of the rotor is assumed to be independent of the other blades. Spatial uncertainties of the rotor with dissimilar blades have considerable influence on the 1 /rev and 2 /rev vibratory hub loads in addition to the 4 /rev vibratory hub loads. The 1 /rev and 2 /rev harmonics of longitudinal and lateral vibratory hub forces, and 1 /rev of vertical vibratory hub force and all three vibratory hub moments are highly sensitive to spatially uncertain material properties.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to further the understanding of rotor aeromechanics at advance ratios (mu) beyond the maximum of 0. 5 (ratio of forward airspeed to rotor tip speed) for conventional helicopters. High advance ratio rotors have applications in high speed compound helicopters. In addition to one or more conventional main rotors, these aircraft employ either thrust compounding (propellers), lift compounding (fixed-wings), or both. An articulated 4 -bladed model rotor was constructed, instrumented, and tested up to a maximum advance ratio of mu= 1. 6 in the Glenn L. Martin Wind Tunnel at the University of Maryland. The data set includes steady and unsteady rotor hub forces and moments, blade structural loads, blade flapping angles, swashplate control angles, and unsteady blade pressures. A collective-thrust control reversal [...] -where increasing collective pitch results in lower rotor thrust [...] -was observed and is a unique phenomenon to the high advance ratio flight regime. The thrust reversal is explained in a physical manner as well as through an analytical formulation. The requirements for the occurrence of the thrust reversal are enumerated. The effects of rotor geometry design on the thrust reversal onset are explored through the formulation and compared to the measured data. Reverse-flow dynamic stall was observed to extend the the lifting capability of the edgewise rotor well beyond the expected static stall behavior of the airfoil sections. Through embedded unsteady blade surface pressure transducers, the normal force, pitching moment, and shed dynamic stall vortex time histories at a blade section in strong reverse flow were analyzed. Favorable comparisons with published 2 -D pitching airfoil reverse flow dynamic stall data indicate that the 3 -D stall environment can likely be predicted using models developed from such 2 -D experiments. Vibratory hub loads were observed to increase with advance ratio. Maximum amplitude was observed near mu= 1, with a reduction in vibratory loads at higher advance ratios. Blade load 4 /rev harmonics dominated due to operation near a 4 /rev fanplot crossing of the 2 nd flap bending mode natural frequency. Oscillatory loads sharply increase in the presence of retreating blade reverse flow dynamic stall, and are evident in blade torsion, pitch link, and <b>hub</b> <b>load</b> measurements. The blades exhibited torsion moment vibrations at the frequency of the 1 st torsion mode in response to the reverse flow pitching moment loading...|$|E

Based on the aerodynamic force, this paper presents a loose coupled aeroelastic analytical model by finite element method. Four sets of composite rotor with different elastic couplings were designed and investigated. The results of the investigation showed that flap-bending/torsion couplings {{have a significant effect on}} the rotor vibratory <b>hub</b> <b>loads</b> and the distribution of the couplings also critical for the degree of vibration reduction.

40|$|In an {{analytical}} study, SMART active flap rotor <b>hub</b> <b>loads</b> have been minimized using nonlinear programming constrained optimization methodology. The recently developed NLPQLP system (Schittkowski, 2010) that employs Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) as its core algorithm was embedded into a driver code (NLP 10 x 10) {{specifically designed to}} minimize active flap rotor <b>hub</b> <b>loads</b> (Leyland, 2014). Three types of practical constraints on the flap deflections have been considered. To validate the current application, two other optimization methods have been used: i) the standard, linear unconstrained method, and ii) the nonlinear Generalized Reduced Gradient (GRG) method with constraints. The new software code NLP 10 x 10 has been systematically checked out. It has been verified that NLP 10 x 10 is functioning as desired.

40|$|The use of {{composite}} tailored couplings in {{rotor blades}} to reduce vibratory <b>hub</b> <b>loads</b> was studied through design, structural and aeroelastic analysis, fabrication, and {{wind tunnel test}} of Mach scale articulated composite rotors with tailored flap-bending/torsion couplings. The rotor design was nominally based on the UH- 60 BLACK HAWK rotor. The 6 -foot diameter blades have a SC 1095 profile and feature a linear twist of - 12 deg. The analysis of composite rotor was carried out using a mixed cross-section structural model, and UMARC. Five sets of composite rotor were fabricated, including a baseline rotor without coupling, rotors with spanwise uniform positive coupling and negative coupling, and rotors with spanwise dual-segmented coupling (FBT-P/N) and triple-segmented coupling. The blade composite D-spar is the primary structural element supporting the blade loads and providing the desired elastic couplings. Non-rotating tests were performed to examine blade structural properties. The measurements showed good correlation with predictions, and good repeatability for the four blades of each rotor set. All rotors were tested at a rotor speed of 2300 rpm (tip Mach number 0. 65) at different advance ratios and thrust levels, in the Glenn L. Martin Wind Tunnel at the University of Maryland. The test results showed that flap-bending/torsion couplings {{have a significant effect}} on the rotor vibratory <b>hub</b> <b>loads.</b> All coupled rotors reduced the 4 /rev vertical force for advance ratios up to 0. 3, with reductions ranging from 1 to 34 %. The mixed coupling rotor FBT-P/N reduced overall 4 /rev <b>hub</b> <b>loads</b> at advance ratios of 0. 1, 0. 2 and 0. 3. At a rotor speed of 2300 rpm and an advance ratio of 0. 3, the FBT-P/N rotor achieved 15 % reduction for 4 /rev vertical force, 3 % for 4 /rev in-plane force and 14 % for 4 /rev head moment. The reductions in the 4 /rev <b>hub</b> <b>loads</b> are related to the experimentally observed reductions in 3 /rev and 5 /rev blade flap bending moments. Through the present research, it has been experimentally demonstrated that structural couplings can significantly impact rotor vibration characteristics, and with suitable design optimization (coupling strength and spanwise distribution) they can be used to reduce vibratory <b>hub</b> <b>loads</b> without penalties...|$|R
40|$|Helicopters {{suffer from}} severe {{vibration}} levels compared to fixed-wing aircraft. The {{main source of}} vibration in a helicopter is the main rotor which operates in a highly unsteady aerodynamic environment. Active vibration control methods are effective in helicopter vibration suppression since they can adapt to various flight conditions and often involve low weight penalty. One such method is the actively controlled flap (ACF) approach. In the ACF approach, a trailing-edge flap (TEF) located in each rotor blade is deflected at higher harmonics of rotor frequency to reduce vibratory loads at the rotor hub. The ACF approach is attractive because of its simplicity in practical implementation, low actuation power and enhanced airworthiness, since the flap control is independent of the primary control system. Multiple-flaps are better suited to modify the aerodynamic loading over the rotor blade and hence offer more flexibility compared to a single flap. They also provide the advantage of redundancy over single-flap configuration. However, issues like the number, location and size of these individual flaps {{need to be addressed}} based on logic and a suitable performance criteria. Preliminary studies on a 4 -bladed hingeless rotor using simple aerodynamic and wake models predict that multiple-flaps are capable of 70 - 75 percent reduction in hub vibration levels. Numerical studies confirm that multiple-flaps require significantly less control effort as compared to single-flap configuration for obtaining similar reductions in hub vibration levels. Detailed studies include more accurate aerodynamic and wake models for the rotor with TEF’s. A simple and efficient flap control algorithm is chosen from literature and modified for use in multiple-flap configuration to actuate every flap near complete authority. The flap algorithm is computationally efficient and performs creditably at both high and low forward speeds. This algorithm works reasonably well in the presence of zero-mean Gaussian noise in <b>hub</b> <b>load</b> data. It is also fairly insensitive to small changes in plant parameters, such as, blade mass and stiffness properties. The optimal locations of multiple TEF’s for maximum reduction in hub vibration are determined using Response Surface methodology. Piezoelectric stack actuators are the most promising candidates for actuation of full-scale TEF’s on helicopter rotors. A major limitation of piezoelectric actuators is their lack of accuracy due to nonlinearity and hysteresis. The hysteresis in the actuators is modeled using the classical Preisach model (CPM). Experimental data from literature is used to estimate the Preisach distribution function. The hub vibration in this case is reduced by about 81 - 86 percent from baseline conditions. The performance of the ACF mechanism can be further improved by using an accurate hysteresis compensation scheme. However, using a linear model for the piezoelectric actuator or an inaccurate compensation scheme can lead to deterioration in ACF performance. Finally, bench-top experiments are conducted on a commercially available piezostack actuator (APA 500 L from CEDRAT Technologies) to study its dynamic hysteresis characteristics. A rate-dependent dynamic hysteresis model based on CPM is used to model the actuator. The unknown coefficients in the model are identified using experiments and validated. Numerical simulations show the importance of modeling actuator hysteresis in helicopter vibration control using TEF’s. A final configuration of multiple flaps is then proposed by including the effects of actuator hysteresis and using the response surface approach to determine the optimal flap locations. It is found that dynamic hysteresis not only affects the vibration reduction levels but also the optimal location of the TEF's...|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} the shake test setup, testing procedure, data acquisition and reduction process, and the shake test results. The first {{objective of the}} shake test is to identify the modal properties of the hub inplane motions. The prediction of the ground resonance for the rotor-support system is {{a crucial part of}} the risk reduction process in rotor testing. Such analysis requires the structural properties of the hub modes as input. In particular, ground resonance is an aeromechanic instability that can occur during the frequency-crossings of the inplane hub and blade motions. Since the frequency of the blade inplane mode varies with the rotor rotational speed, the frequency-crossings define the critical speed ranges in rotor operation. Ground resonance depends on the level of damping of the blade inplane 2 modes as well as the damping of the hub modes, which in turn depends on the structural properties of the stand support system. Several configurations of the wind tunnel setup were shake-tested to identify a ground resonance-safe test configuration. The second objective of the shake test is to perform a dynamic calibration of the rotor balance. Accurate measurement of the rotor vibratory <b>hub</b> <b>loads</b> is crucial in the development of rotor systems and has remained one of the major challenges in rotorcraft testing (refs. 1 [...] 4).

40|$|An optimal {{procedure}} {{for the design}} of rotor blade that generates low vibratory <b>hub</b> <b>loads</b> in nonaxial flow conditions is presented and applied to a helicopter rotor in forward flight, a condition where vibrations and noise become severe. Blade shape and structural properties are the design parameters to be identified within a binary genetic optimization algorithm under aeroelastic stability constraint. The process exploits an aeroelastic solver that is based on a nonlinear, beam-like model, suited for the analysis of arbitrary curved-elastic-axis blades, with the introduction of a surrogate wake inflow model for the analysis of sectional aerodynamic loads. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach to identify low vibratory <b>hub</b> <b>loads</b> rotor blades as well as to assess the robustness of solution at off-design operating conditions. Further, the aeroacoustic assessment of the rotor configurations determined is carried out in order to examine the impact of low-vibration blade design on the emitted noise field...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} and {{analyzes the}} measurements from a full-scale, slowed RPM, UH- 60 A rotor tested at the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex 40 - by 80 - ft wind tunnel {{up to an}} advance ratio of 1. 0. A comprehensive set of measurements, that includes performance, blade <b>loads,</b> <b>hub</b> <b>loads</b> and pressures/airloads makes this data set unique. The measurements reveal new and rich aeromechanical phenomena that are special to this exotic regime. These include reverse chord dynamic stall, retreating side impulse in pitch-link load, large inboard-outboard elastic twist differential, supersonic flow at low subsonic advancing tip Mach numbers, diminishing rotor forces yet dramatic build up of blade loads, and dramatic blade loads yet benign levels of vibratory <b>hub</b> <b>loads.</b> The objective {{of this research is}} the fundamental understanding of these unique aeromechanical phenomena. The intent is to provide useful knowledge for the design of high speed, high efficiency, slowed RPM rotors of the future and a challenging database for advanced analyses validation...|$|R
40|$|The {{prediction}} of blade deflections and vibratory <b>hub</b> <b>loads</b> concerning helicopter main rotors in forward flight is {{the objective of}} this work. They are determined by using an aeroelastic model derived through the coupling between a nonlinear blade structural model and a boundary integral equation solver for three-dimen- sional, unsteady, potential aerodynamics. The Galerkin method is used for the spatial integration, whereas the periodic blade response is determined by a harmonic balance approach. This aeroelastic model yields a unified approach for aeroelastic response and blade pressure prediction that may be used for aeroacoustic purposes, with the possibility of including effects from both blade-vortex inter-action and multiple-body aerodynamic interaction. Quasi-steady aerodynamic models with wake-inflow from the three-dimensional aerodynamic solver are also applied, in order to perform a comparative study. Numerical results show the capability of the aeroelastic tool to evaluate blade response and vibratory <b>hub</b> <b>loads</b> for a helicopter main rotor in level flight conditions, and examine the sensitivity of the predictions on the aerodynamics model used...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of blade design parameters in rotor vibratory response {{and the design}} of a minimum vibration blade based upon this understanding are examined. Various design approaches are examined for a 4 bladed articulated rotor operating at a high speed flight condition. Blade modal shaping, frequency placement, structural and aerodynamic coupling, and intermodal cancellation are investigated to systematically identify and evaluate blade design parameters that influence blade airloads, blade modal response, <b>hub</b> <b>loads,</b> and fuselage vibration. The relative contributions of the various components of blade force excitation and response to the vibratory <b>hub</b> <b>loads</b> transmitted to the fuselage are determined in order to isolate primary candidates for vibration alleviation. A blade design is achieved which reduces the predicted fuselage vibration from the baseline blade by approximately one half. Blade designs are developed that offer significant reductions in vibration (and fatigue stresses) without resorting to special vibration alleviation devices, radical blade geometries, or weight penalties...|$|R
40|$|Aeroelastic {{optimization}} of a four-bladed, soft-inplane hingeless rotor {{is performed}} to reduce <b>hub</b> <b>loads</b> and blade root loads with blade stiffness design variables. An aeroelastic analysis {{based on the}} finite element method is used. Aerodynamic modeling includes a time domain unsteady aerodynamic model and a free wake model. Metamodels (models of models) of the aeroelastic analysis are investigated in a systematic manner including various experimental designs such as factorial designs, central composite designs (CCD), gradient-enhanced CCD, and orthogonal arrays (OA). Linear, quadratic, and cubic polynomial response surfaces are obtained, and graphical, statistical, and,optimization results obtained are {{used to compare the}} different designs. It is found that the CCD and OA are able to capture the basic trends of the analysis using sequential second-order polynomial response surfaces and are further investigated for use in optimization. However, the OA, which is a fractional factorial design, requires significantly fewer analysis runs than the CCD. Numerical results obtained for single-objective and multiobjective optimization problems show a 16 - 22 % reduction in vibratory <b>hub</b> <b>loads</b> for a nonuniform-blade with six elastic stiffness design variables. The multiobjective optimization problem based on the min-max method reduces the vibratory <b>hub</b> <b>loads</b> by about 16 % and the 1 /rev and 2 /rev blade root loads,which are the principal cause of dynamic stresses, by about 18 and 31 %, respectively. The OA-based metamodels provide an efficient and interactive approach to perform preliminary design studies using comprehensive simulation codes and is suitable for use in an industrial setting...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{research}} of <b>hub</b> vibratory <b>loads</b> {{is a very}} complicated problem of blade aeroelastic response. Based on the airflow environment of blade, the method of <b>hub</b> vibratory <b>loads</b> prediction will be produced when the helicopter flights forward with high speed. It involves the Leishman-Beddoes unsteady model and dynamic stall model, the dynamic inflow theory, the Piters He generalized dynamic wake theory, elastic flap movement of blade and so on.
