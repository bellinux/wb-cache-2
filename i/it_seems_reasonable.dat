Military figures of the time often imply perhaps several men-at-arms per knight (i.e., a stated force of 500 knights is assumed to contain perhaps 1,500 men-at-arms in addition), so <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>reasonable</b> that Bohemond had with him approximately 8,000 men-at-arms and 2,000 cavalry.|$|E

On that account, the suggestion of Lloyd, which places the battle at a gap now crossed by the Naas Road on the section between Kill and Rathcoole, is still worthy of consideration. In any event, the engagement took place within an easy day’s march of Dublin, as Brian pressed on immediately afterwards to reach the town on the following day.|$|E
500|$|The {{sources on}} the origin of the ship's {{propulsion}} machinery disagree. Russian sources say that two sets of steam turbines were ordered on 22 April 1913 from the Franco-Russian Works in Saint Petersburg for the Admiralty-built ships and that the Baltic Works built the turbines for its ships, with some components ordered from abroad. Western sources, however, maintain that Navarins turbines were ordered from AG Vulcan Stettin and that they were seized after {{the start of the war}} and used in the Brummer-class cruisers. Given that the same Russian companies had built the similar, albeit less powerful, turbines for the Gangut-class battleships, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>reasonable</b> that the Russian sources are correct, and that the components ordered from Germany were incorporated into the German ships.|$|E

500|$|The {{size of the}} Cuthbert Gospel {{places it}} within the Insular {{tradition}} of the [...] "pocket gospels", of which eight Irish examples survive, including the Book of Dimma, Book of Mulling, and Book of Deer, although all the others are or were originally texts of all four gospels, {{with the possible exception}} of a few pages from the Gospel of John enshrined with the Stowe Missal in its cumdach or book-reliquary. [...] There was a tradition of even smaller books, whose use seems to have been often amuletic, and a manuscript of John alone, with a page size of 72 x 56mm, was found in a reliquary at Chartres Cathedral in 1712. [...] It is probably Italian from the 5th or 6th century, and the label it carried in 1712 saying it was a relic of St Leobinus, a bishop of Chartes who died in about 556, may be correct. [...] The other examples are mostly in Greek or the Coptic language and contain a variety of biblical texts, especially psalters. [...] Julian Brown concludes that the three Latin manuscripts of John [...] "seem to attest an early medieval practice of placing a complete Gospel of St. John in a shrine, as a protective amulet; and <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>reasonable</b> to conclude that our manuscript was placed in St. Cuthbert's coffin to protect it".|$|E
500|$|The Abbasid army, {{following}} the reforms of al-Mu'tasim, was a {{smaller and more}} professional fighting force than the caliphal armies of the past. Although it proved effective militarily, it also posed a potential danger to {{the stability of the}} Abbasid regime: drawn from Turks and other peoples from the Caliphate's periphery and the lands beyond, it was alienated from the society of the Caliphate's heartlands, with the result that the soldiers were [...] "entirely reliant on the state not just for cash but for their very survival" [...] (Hugh Kennedy). As a result, any failure by the central government to provide their pay resulted in a military uprising and a political crisis, as had been repeatedly demonstrated during the Anarchy at Samarra. Consequently, ensuring the regular payment of the army became the prime task of the state. According to Hugh Kennedy, based on a treasury document from the time of al-Mu'tadid's accession, [...] "out of the total expenditure of 7915 dinars per day, some 5121 are entirely military, 1943 in areas (like riding animals and stables) which served both military and non-military and only 851 in areas like the bureaucracy and the harem which can be described as truly civilian (though even in this case, the bureaucrats’ main purpose seems to have been to arrange the payment of the army). <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>reasonable</b> to conclude that something over 80 per cent of recorded government expenditure was devoted to maintaining the army." ...|$|E

2500|$|Earlier heraldic writers {{attributed}} the lions of England to William the Conqueror, but the earliest {{evidence of the}} association of lions with the English crown is a seal bearing two lions passant, used by the future King John during the lifetime of his father, Henry II, who died in 1189.

2500|$|The digressions {{individually}} frustrate {{readers who}} expect a clear purpose. Each digression {{has its own}} topic, and each is an essay on its particular sidelight. In his biography of Swift, Ehrenpreis argued that each digression is an impersonation of a different contemporary author.

Prior to Ehrenpreis, some critics had argued that the narrator of the Tale is a character, just as the narrator of a novel would be. Given the evidence of A. C.

2500|$|In {{almost all}} {{cultures}} objects are named using {{one or two}} words equivalent to [...] "kind" [...] (genus) and [...] "particular kind" [...] (species). When made up of two words (a binomial) the name usually consists of a noun (like salt, dog or star) and an adjectival second word that helps describe the first, and therefore makes the name, as a whole, more [...] "specific", for example, lap dog, sea salt, or film star. The meaning of the noun used for a common name may have been lost or forgotten (whelk, elm, lion, shark, pig) but when the common name is extended to two or more words much more is conveyed about the organism's use, appearance or other special properties (sting ray, poison apple, giant stinking hogweed, hammerhead shark). These noun-adjective binomials are just like our own names with a family or surname like Simpson and another adjectival Christian or forename name that specifies which Simpson, say Homer Simpson. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>reasonable</b> {{to assume that the}} form of scientific names we call binomial nomenclature is derived from this simple and practical way of constructing common names - but with the use of Latin as a universal language.|$|E
2500|$|Discovered between 2003 and 2005, {{networks}} of stone-lined or stone-enclosed drains and conduits, extending at least 1.5 kilometers, demonstrate sophisticated hydraulics.
