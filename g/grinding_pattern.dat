40|$|Sleep Bruxism is a {{significant}} etiology of temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and causes many dental or oral problems such as tooth wear or facet. There is no study analyzing the relationship between sleep bruxism and TMD. Objective: To investigate any relationship between occlusal <b>grinding</b> <b>pattern</b> during sleep bruxism and temporomandibular disorder. Methods: A cross-sectional study involving 30 sleep bruxism patients attended the Faculty Dentistry Universitas Indonesia Teaching Hospital (RSGMP FKG UI). Completion of 2 forms of ID-TMD index and questionnaire from American Academy of Sleep Medicine were done. BruxChecker was fabricated and used for two nights to record the occlusal <b>grinding</b> <b>pattern.</b> The occlusal <b>grinding</b> <b>pattern</b> was categorized into laterotrusive grinding (LG) and mediotrusive side. Further divisons of LG were: incisor-canine (IC), incisor-caninepremolar (ICP) and incisor-canine-premolar-molar (ICPM). Mediotrusive side was classified as mediotrusive contact (MC) and mediotrusive grinding (MG). Results: It was found that occlusal <b>grinding</b> <b>pattern</b> in non-TMD subjects were IC+MC, in subjects with mild TMD were ICP+MG and in subjects with moderate TMD were ICP+MG and ICPM+MG. TMJ was more significantly affected by ICP and ICPM <b>grinding</b> <b>pattern</b> than that of IC. Conclusion: There was {{a significant}} relationship between occlusal <b>grinding</b> <b>pattern</b> during sleep bruxism and TMD. DOI: 10. 14693 /jdi. v 20 i 2. 149 </p...|$|E

A critical issue in SDSG is the <b>grinding</b> marks <b>pattern.</b> In this paper, a mathematical model is developed to study the <b>grinding</b> marks <b>pattern</b> in SDSG of silicon wafers.

40|$|In this paper, {{a new and}} {{innovative}} method for the <b>patterning</b> of <b>grinding</b> wheels is presented. The patterns are machined with a patterning tool by using fly-cutting kinematics. By changing the patterning process parameters, different pattern sizes and densities can be machined in a flexible way. Surface and cylindrical grinding experiments show that <b>grinding</b> with <b>patterned</b> <b>grinding</b> wheels can significantly reduce process forces, grinding burn, and grinding power. The surface roughness increases because less active cutting edges remain when <b>grinding</b> with <b>patterned</b> wheels. But especially for roughing processes, the results show great potential for increasing the overall grinding performance. The final publication is available at Springer via [URL]...|$|R
40|$|In 1998, BNSF started {{transitioning}} their rail from {{a corrective}} state of wear and surface fatigue {{back to the}} favored preventive state. The National Research Council of Canada developed a unique rail-grinding strategy called Preventive-Gradual to effect the transition. This strategy was shown to extend rail life through reduced wear. The rail was restored to a superior surface condition, grinder productivity increased, and cost per finished mile decreased. Techniques for managing preventive grinding programs are reviewed, and methods to optimize the preventive-gradual strategy through rail profile design, <b>grinding</b> <b>pattern</b> refinement, and determination of the optimal wear rate are presented.

40|$|Grinding {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} manufacturing processes, especially when high surface qualities have to be realized or if hard or brittle materials have to be machined. Often the grinding performance is limited by workpiece failure due to a high thermal load in the contact zone. Therefore structured or <b>patterned</b> <b>grinding</b> wheels are frequently used to reduce the thermal load in the contact zone. In this paper a new patterning method will be introduced by using a fly-cutting kinematic for the structuring process. In face <b>grinding</b> experiments the <b>patterned</b> <b>grinding</b> wheels showed great potential to enhance the overall grinding performance by significantly decreasing process forces and grinding burn. The reduction of the thermal load in the contact zone can be explained by an improved coolant flow through the contact zone, which was measured with a specially designed coolant collecting bin...|$|R
40|$|According to {{the authors}} of the article, it has been proven that dry and damp {{materials}} crushed in grinders of the shock type demonstrate different <b>grinding</b> <b>patterns.</b> Therefore, {{there is a need to}} explore the influence of the moisture content produced on the efficiency of grinding. The most efficient grinding mode is the one that assures maximal probability of destruction. Centrifugal grinders were used to analyze the grinding process. The experimental data have proven that the probability of destruction of damp samples is a lot higher than the one of dry samples, given the same initial dimensions of particles and the loading intensity. The rise in the probability of destruction is stipulated by the fact that that the grinder speed at which crushing is triggered is lower in case of damp samples than in case of dry ones. Expressions for speed that describes destruction initiation and the probability of destruction depending on the type of materials, the moisture content and the loading intensity have been derived. Результаты исследований показали, что вероятность разрушения влажного материала выше, чем сухого. Увеличение вероятности разрушения связано тем, что скорость начала разрушения влажных материалов снижается по сравнению с сухими...|$|R
40|$|The ball {{bearings}} behind the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) HPOTP preburner pump {{have a history}} of premature wear requiring their replacement. Extensive tests have been conducted in an attempt to identify the operating factors that contribute to the wear. It has been conjectured that the coolant inflow velocity swirl pattern can aid bearing operation by matching ball orbit speed and thus affect bearing life. However, control of the velocity distribution up to now could only be achieved by trial and error following hardware testing. Observation of hardware from recent flight and development operation led to the hypothesis that certain assemblies with more extensive <b>grinding</b> <b>patterns</b> on the backwall of the impeller for rotor balancing correlated with improved bearing wear. To analytically evaluate the effect of cavity configuration on the flowfield, 3 -D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses of various geometries was successfully executed using REACT 3 D. Height of the anti-vortex ribs on the stationary wall was varied, as was the configuration of the rotating wall, from smooth to simulations of various grindout patterns. The results obtained indicate the effects of the various geometries and provide valuable guidelines for cavity modification to optimize bearing cooling...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} a novel dressing technique {{that allows the}} inscription of pre-configurable patterns, or textures, on the grinding wheel surface. An electro-mechanical exciter connected to the dressing tool receives synchronized signal from a control software engraving <b>patterns</b> on the <b>grinding</b> wheel. The dressing and grinding operations were evaluated using the AE mapping technique. The presented applications show the use of textured grinding wheels for better grinding process performance in conventional applications and also {{for the production of}} patterned surfaces in order to change its functional performance. The results and analysis allow {{a better understanding of the}} <b>grinding</b> mechanism with <b>patterned</b> wheels.

Objectives The aim {{of this study is to}} verify the presence of oral changes in smokers and the impact of the changes on masticatory function compared with individuals who never smoked. Methods Forty-eight subjects were evaluated, split into two study groups (24 subjects each) of current tobacco users and individuals who have never smoked. The variables halitosis, presence of lesions suggestive of caries and periodontal problems, number of teeth, classification of malocclusions according to angle, standard <b>grinding</b> food, chewing <b>pattern,</b> and speed of chewing were evaluated. Results There was no statistically significant difference in tooth loss between the groups, but the smokers had more losses manifesting malocclusion. Most smokers had halitosis and lesions suggestive of caries and periodontal problems; the halitosis was associated with the latter variable. Masticatory speed was also reduced significantly in these individuals compared with the control group when associated with occlusal alterations, in addition to grinding food with the tongue. No difference was observed regarding the chewing pattern. The presence of halitosis and periodontal problems were more common in those who smoke more than 20 years. Conclusion There is an association between smoking and dental changes, which cause increased masticatory changes...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2006 The current project {{identifies}} skeletal {{patterns that}} indicate habitual behavior using muscle attachment sites, osteoarthritic changes and long-bone robusticity. Using a sample from HK 43, a cemetery {{used by the}} Naqada II A-C working class (circa 3, 800 - 3, 400 B. C.), patterns were determined with respect to sex, and by age group. Those patterns were then compared to hypothesized models of skeletal markers predicted to occur with habitual use of an Egyptian hoe, an ox-drawn ard-style plow, a shaduf (a simple machine used in irrigation), and grinding grain using a saddle quern and <b>grinding</b> stone. The <b>patterns</b> displayed in the sample population correspond to predicted patterns created by habitual activity. Results were determined twice; first by sex, then by age. Females and males were grouped regardless of age, and vice versa. If divided by both, the resulting groups were {{too small to be}} compared. Females demonstrated a pattern that was most consistent with grinding grain. Males were determined to have a pattern most consistent with hoeing and using a shaduf The middle adult age group, composed of both males and females, showed a range of skeletal markers that is most consistent with that predicted for plowing. Not all patterns were easily explained, however. The young adult, or 17 - 24 year old age group displayed a pattern of muscle attachment very similar to the old adult group,> 45 years of age. The source of that apparent similarity will have to be addressed by further research at Hierakonpolis, Egypt...|$|R
