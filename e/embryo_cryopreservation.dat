Recently authorized in France, vitrification tends to replace gradually the conventional technique of slow freezing, so upsetting the {{practices in the}} management of patients. It allows from now on the cryopreservation of oocytes and opens new perspectives in egg donation either still in fertility preservation. This review thus attempted to examine the contribution of vitrification in the freezing of oocytes and human embryos at various stages of development. If obviously vitrification appears as the current method of choice for the cryopreservation of oocytes as well as blastocysts, the results are less cut as regards embryos to early stages.

25|$|It is {{not unusual}} that after the PGD, there are more embryos {{suitable}} for transferring back to the woman than necessary.

25|$|Embryos who {{reach the}} day 3 cell stage {{can be tested}} for {{chromosomal}} or specific genetic defects prior to possible transfer by preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). Transferring at the blastocyst stage confers {{a significant increase in}} live birth rate per transfer, but also confers a decreased number of embryos available for transfer and <b>embryo</b> <b>cryopreservation,</b> so the cumulative clinical pregnancy rates are increased with cleavage stage transfer.

25|$|The main {{durations}} of {{embryo culture}} are until cleavage stage (day {{two to four}} after co-incubation) or the blastocyst stage (day five or six after co-incubation).

There are significantly higher odds of preterm birth (odds ratio 1.3) and congenital anomalies (odds ratio 1.3) among births having from embryos cultured until the blastocyst stage compared with cleavage stage.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} that reduce {{the viability of}} plant somatic <b>embryos</b> following <b>cryopreservation</b> are not known. The objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the sensitivity of cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) somatic embryos at different stages of an encapsulation-dehydration protocol using stress-related volatile hydrocarbons as markers of injury and recovery. The plant stress hormone ethylene and volatile hydrocarbons derived from hydroxyl radicals (methane) and lipid peroxidation (ethane) were determined using gas chromatography headspace analysis. Ethylene and methane were the only volatiles detected, with both being produced after each step of the cryogenic protocol. Ethylene production was significantly reduced following exposure to liquid nitrogen, but then increased in parallel with embryo recovery. In contrast, the production of methane was cyclic during recovery, with the first cycle occurring earlier for embryos recovered from liquid nitrogen and desiccation than those recovered from earlier steps in the protocol. These results suggest that loss of somatic <b>embryo</b> viability during <b>cryopreservation</b> may be related to the oxidative status of the tissue, and its capacity to produce ethylene. This study has demonstrated that headspace volatile analysis provides a robust non-destructive analytical approach for assessing the survival and recovery of plant somatic <b>embryos</b> following <b>cryopreservation...</b>|$|R

2500|$|By 2017, many {{centers have}} adopted <b>embryo</b> <b>cryopreservation</b> {{as their primary}} IVF therapy, and perform few or no fresh embryo transfers.

2500|$|Embryos can {{be either}} “fresh” from fertilized egg cells of the same menstrual cycle, or “frozen”, that is they have been {{generated}} in a preceding cycle and undergone <b>embryo</b> <b>cryopreservation,</b> and are thawed {{just prior to the}} transfer, which is then termed [...] "frozen embryo transfer" [...] (FET). The outcome from using cryopreserved embryos has uniformly been positive with no increase in birth defects or development abnormalities, also between fresh versus frozen eggs used for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). In fact, pregnancy rates are increased following FET, and perinatal outcomes are less affected, compared to embryo transfer in the same cycle as ovarian hyperstimulation was performed. The endometrium is believed to not be optimally prepared for implantation following ovarian hyperstimulation, and therefore frozen embryo transfer avails for a separate cycle to focus on optimizing the chances of successful implantation. Children born from vitrified blastocysts have significantly higher birthweight than those born from non-frozen blastocysts. When transferring a frozen-thawed oocyte, the chance of pregnancy is essentially the same whether it is transferred in a natural cycle or one with ovulation induction.|$|E

The model is based on analytical expressions that reflect the main causes of embryonic mortality during in vitro and in vivo cultivation, crioconservation and embryo transplantation.

40|$|For the {{development}} of in vitro produced (IVP) {{as well as in}} vivo produced bovine embryos, it is extremely important that their energy metabolism works properly because the embryo must be able to metabolize energy substrates that are necessary for producing energy. Lipids {{play an important role in}} early embryonic development, acting as source of energy for oocytes and embryos. However, it is known that oocytes and embryos, mainly IVP, accumulate large amounts of lipids in the cytoplasm. Although they are extremely important in embryonic development, lipids have been associated with the reduced survival of bovine <b>embryos</b> following <b>cryopreservation.</b> There is evidence that at least four different categories of lipids affect <b>embryo</b> survival after <b>cryopreservation,</b> including triglycerides (TAG), free fatty acids, cholesterol and phospholipids. Thus, many studies are being conducted to improve the resistance of IVP <b>embryos</b> to the <b>cryopreservation</b> process by reducing the concentration or removing the source of serum from the medium or by reducing oocyte/embryo lipids using mechanical or chemical means.

40|$|Here we {{describe}} {{a new technique}} for cryopreserving mouse ovaries by using 0. 5 -mL straws. One advantage of this method is that it uses the same controlled-rate freezer and programming routinely used for the <b>cryopreservation</b> of mouse <b>embryos.</b> Using a 0. 5 -mL French straw loaded {{in the same way}} as for embryo freezing (for example, the one-step dilution method) with 1 M sucrose as an osmotic buffer and 2 M propylene glycol as the cryoprotectant containing the ovary sample, we further standardized the 2 methodologies. Applying this technique, 11 ovarian halves were cryopreserved in straws and stored under liquid nitrogen. Straws containing the frozen ovarian halves were thawed in a water bath at room temperature and the recovered ovaries orthotopically implanted into 11 recipient female mice; 8 of the 11 frozen ovarian halves resulted in functional ovaries. The 73 % pregnancy rate resulted in a total of 53 pups born, of which 38 (72 %) were generated from cryopreserved ovaries. Ovarian cryopreservation has been demonstrated to be a valid option for banking mouse genetic resources. Unlike frozen <b>embryos,</b> <b>cryopreservation</b> of ovarian tissue preserves haploid gametes.

40|$|Both the slow-freezing method with {{increased}} sucrose concentration and new vitrification techniques significantly improve {{the results of}} cryopreservation of human oocytes. The recent perfection for vitrification includes the concepts of increase of cooling and warming rates using minimum volume methods, and decrease of toxicity by reducing the concentration of cryoprotectants. In the recent literature, the survival of cryopreserved oocytes ranged from 74 % to 90 % using the slow-freezing method and from 84 % to 99 % by vitrification. Overall, the survival rate of oocytes from vitrification (95 %, 899 / 948) appeared {{higher than that of}} the slow-freezing method (75 %, 1, 275 / 1, 683). The microtubules of meiotic spindles are vulnerable to the thermal changes and will depolymerize. After incubation, the microtubules repolymerize. Spindle recovery is faster after vitrification than slow freezing. Even so, after 3 hours of incubation, spindle recuperation is similar between vitrification and slow freezing. Considering both aspects of spindle recovery and oocyte aging, the time schedule for oocyte cryopreservation program makes fertilization in the optimal time. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection is performed for oocytes at 3 hours of post-thaw incubation from the slow-freezing method and 2 hours from vitrification, with restoration of meiotic spindles. The pregnancy potential of cryopreserved oocytes is comparable to that of fresh oocytes or frozen <b>embryos.</b> <b>Cryopreservation</b> of oocytes would importantly contribute to oocyte donation and preservation of fertility for cancer patients...|$|R
