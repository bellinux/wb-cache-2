40|$|Ambient {{conditions}} {{can have a}} significant impact on the average and maximum temperature of the battery of electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Given the sensitivity of the ageing mechanisms of typical battery cells to temperature, a significant variability in battery lifetime has been reported with geographical location. In addition, high battery temperature and the associated cooling requirements can cause poor passenger thermal comfort, while extreme battery temperatures can negatively impact the power output of the battery, limiting the available electric traction torque. Avoiding such issues requires enabling battery cooling even when the vehicle is parked and not plugged in (<b>key-off),</b> but the associated extra energy requirements make applying <b>key-off</b> cooling a non-trivial decision. In this paper, a representative plug-in parallel hybrid electric vehicle model is used to simulate a typical 24 -h duty cycle to quantify the impact of hot ambient conditions on three performance attributes of the vehicle: the battery lifetime, passenger thermal comfort and fuel economy. <b>Key-off</b> cooling is defined as an optimal control problem in view of the duty cycle of the vehicle. The problem is then solved using the dynamic programming method. Controlling <b>key-off</b> cooling through this method leads to significant improvements in the battery lifetime, while benefiting the fuel economy and thermal comfort attributes. To further improve the battery lifetime, partial charging of the battery is considered. An algorithm is developed that determines the optimum combination of <b>key-off</b> cooling and the level of battery charge. Simulation results confirm the benefits of the proposed method...|$|E
40|$|Permanent magnet {{synchronous}} machines (PMSMs) {{are widely}} used in electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles to propel the wheels. Various control strategies {{have been developed for}} PMSM drive systems to achieve both high efficiency and safe operation. In a PMSM drive system, generally the high voltage battery and the power converters are connected by a relay. In vehicle <b>key-off</b> events, although the battery is isolated immediately from the relay, the DC bus filter capacitor has to be discharged as quickly as possible to avoid an electrical hazard. This research explores the DC bus capacitor discharge of PMSM drive systems for hybrid/electric vehicles. Based on analyzing the power flow during discharge, a three-stage discharge algorithm has been developed, including a fast discharge stage, a DC bus voltage closed-loop regulation stage, and an inverter shutdown stage. The DC bus capacitor is quickly and safely discharged by dynamically adjusting the command currents for the current vector control of PMSMs. Both simulation and experimental results show the feasibility and performance of the proposed discharge technique...|$|E
40|$|Very little {{information}} {{is known about}} the impact electrification has on driving behavior, or how drivers charge their electrified vehicles. The recent influx of electrified vehicles presents a new market of vehicles which allow drivers the option between electrical or conventional gasoline energy sources. The current battery capacity in full battery electric vehicles requires planning of routes not required of conventional vehicles, due to the limited range, extended charging times, and limited charging infrastructure. There is currently {{little information}} on how drivers react to these limitations. A number of current models of fully electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, transmit data wirelessly on key-on, <b>key-off,</b> and charging events. The data includes battery state of charge, distance of miles driven on gasoline and electric, energy consumed, and many other parameters associated to driving and charging behavior. In this thesis, this data was then processed and analyzed to benchmark the performance and characteristics of driving and charging patterns. Vehicles were analyzed and contrasted based on model type, geographic location, length of ownership and other variables. This data was able to show benchmarks and parameters in aggregate for 56 weeks of electrified vehicle tracking. These parameters were compared to the EV Project, a large scale electrified vehicle study performed by Idaho National Labs, to confirm patterns of expected behavior. New parameters which were not present in the EV Project were analyzed and provided insight to charging and driving behavior not examined in any previous study on a large scale. This study provides benchmarks and conclusions on this new driving behavior, such as large scale analysis of brake regeneration performance and degradation of range anxiety. Analysis of the differences on charging and driving behavior between geographic regions and experience were examined, providing insight to how these variables affect performance and driving and charging patterns. Comparison of parameters established by the EV Project and new parameters analyzed in this report will help build a benchmark for future studies of electrified vehicles. M. S...|$|E
40|$|Thermal engine {{encapsulation}} is {{an increasingly}} popular design choice, which insulates the engine from {{the external environment}} and retains heat in the engine after it is turned off. This decelerates motor cool-down and increases the probability for high initial temperature at a subsequent engine start, resulting in shorter warm-up and reduced friction between engine parts.  This work investigates thermal engine encapsulation (TEE) {{as a means to}} reduce engine friction and fuel consumption during engine warm-up. In order to predict the effects of TEE on the fuel consumption, it is necessary to model a wide range of thermal phenomena in different subsystems of the powertrain. The presented work proposes an integrated simulation methodology that enables efficient numerical simulations of heat transfer in the powertrain cooling systems and the engine structures not only during dynamic driving but also during the process of engine cool-down when the vehicle is parked. The integrated simulation includes a number sub-models that capture relevant phenomena in the vehicle powertrain and underhood. Presented in detail is the simulation procedure, which ultimately predicts the continuous development of the temperatures of the engine oil and the coolant as well as the temperatures of the different engine parts and components from the powertrain cooling system. An automated coupling between the one-dimensional (1 D) thermal representation of the engine and powertrain cooling systems with a three-dimensional (3 D) CFD model of buoyancy-driven flow in the engine bay computes the heat rejection during engine cool-down. By use of an integrated friction correction map the engine model computes the variation of friction losses at different engine temperatures. The integrated simulation model makes possible to predict the temperature of engine structures after a long period of engine inactivity preceded by dynamic driving, the exact temperature development of engine structures and cooling fluids after a recurring engine start, as well as the variations in the instantaneous fuel consumption.  Furthermore, a TEE concept for a passenger vehicle has been designed. The presented simulation method is applied to evaluate the effect of the proposed encapsulation on the development of engine temperatures during cool-down and their effect on the fuel consumption during a sequence of two Worldwide harmonized light vehicle test cycles (WLTC) separated with a period of inactivity. The results indicate a significant capability of encapsulations with high degree of coverage to retain engine heat for long time periods after <b>key-off.</b> The obtained results show that the encapsulated engine setup has potential for up to 3. 1 % savings of the fuel burned during a WLTC by a non-encapsulated engine in a cold environment. The amount of fuel saved depends primarily on the specific engine (mass, size and geometry), encapsulation design (geometry, thickness and degree of coverage), ambient temperature, and time of inactivity between engine shut-down and start-up. For periods of inactivity between 2 to 8 hours the potential for fuel saving is at least 2. 5 % of the total fuel burned during WLTC at ambient temperature of 5 °C for encapsulation with 97 % coverage...|$|E
