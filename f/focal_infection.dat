(Soon, independent investigators ventured to Cotton's facility and performed, it seems, psychiatry's first two controlled clinical trials, finding Cotton's clams false.)

Extraintestinal salmonellosis accounted for 8 % of all salmonellosis episodes. Fifty-two medical reports, dealing with 6 cases of typhoid fever, 32 cases of bacteremia, and 14 <b>focal</b> <b>infections,</b> were reviewed. All cases of typhoid fever except 1, 7 cases of bacteremia, and 5 <b>focal</b> <b>infections</b> were not related to any underlying disease or predisposing factors, while 25 cases of bacteremia and 9 <b>focal</b> <b>infections</b> were associated {{with some of these}} risk factors.

Fifty-one nontyphoid strains were analyzed and assigned to 21 genomic groups, which were defined by serotype, combined ribotype, and combined randomly amplified polymorphic DNA type (each genomic group could include organisms differing in some phenotypic traits). The relationships between genomic groups and clinical presentations were traced. Organisms causing 22 episodes (17 episodes of bacteremia, 2 of pneumonia, 1 of peritonitis, 1 of pyelonephritis, and 1 of cystitis) belonged to a prevalent Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis genomic group, which included organisms assigned to four phage types, five biotypes, and four resistance patterns, causing infections in patients with and without risk factors.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence and factors associated with bacterial sepsis, causative agents, and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns among patients with VL. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted among parasitologically confirmed VL patients suspected of sepsis admitted to the University of Gondar Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia, from February 2012 to May 2012. Blood cultures and other clinical samples were collected and cultured following the standard procedures. Results. Among 83 sepsis suspected VL patients 16 (19. 3 %) had culture confirmed bacterial sepsis.

Using generalized linear mixed modelling approaches applied to data from school-aged children from Zanzibar, Tanzania, we determined the strength of association between four <b>focal</b> <b>infections</b> (i. e. Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, hookworm and self-reported fever, the latter used as a proxy for viral, bacterial or protozoal infections) and the prevalence or intensity of each of the helminth infections.

We found that the risk of infection with all four <b>focal</b> <b>infections</b> was strongly associated with at least one other infection, and that this was frequently dependent on the intensity of that other infection. In comparison, no other incorporated risk factor was associated with all <b>focal</b> <b>infections.</b> Successful control of infectious diseases requires identification of infection risk factors. This study demonstrates that co-infection is likely to be one of these principal risk factors and should therefore be given greater consideration when designing disease-control strategies.

Results: The median age was 12 (range 1 – 216) months. Malnutrition was found in 55 patients (51 %), and 22 (20 %) displayed severe features (weight loss > 40 %). Seventy-two patients (67 %) had previously been hospitalized, and 59 (55 %) had received antibiotics during the month before admission. Fever (85 %) and diarrhea (56 %) were the most frequent clinical manifestations. Nineteen children (18 %) had leukopenia. Forty-nine patients (46 %) had only bacteremia, 33 (31 %) bacteremia with <b>focal</b> <b>infections,</b> and 25 (23 %) <b>focal</b> <b>infections</b> with negative blood cultures.

Nonoral A. actinomycetemcomitans strains showed great similarity to the oral strains, confirming that the oral cavity is the likely source of nonoral A. actinomycetemcomitans infections.
