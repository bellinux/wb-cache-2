5|$|Early {{aircraft}} {{suffered from}} leaks in wing fuel tanks that required re-sealing after each flight and 85 aircraft {{were found to}} have cracks in outer wing ribs and stringers. There were also problems with aileron control cylinders, electrical connectors, and <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> fires. Reconnaissance RF-4Cs made their debut in Vietnam on 30 October 1965, flying the hazardous post-strike reconnaissance missions. The USAF Thunderbirds used the F-4E from the 1969 season until 1974.|$|E
5|$|After the 1973 oil crisis, the Brazilian {{government}} made mandatory {{the use of}} ethanol blends with gasoline, and neat ethanol-powered cars (E100 only) were launched to the market in 1979, after testing with several prototypes developed by four carmakers. Brazilian carmakers modified gasoline engines to support ethanol characteristics and changes included compression ratio, amount of fuel injected, replacement of materials that would get corroded by the contact with ethanol, use of colder spark plugs suitable for dissipating heat due to higher flame temperatures, and an auxiliary cold-start system that injects gasoline from a small tank in the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> to help starting when cold.|$|E
5|$|At nightfall, as {{the three}} swap stories, the great white returns unexpectedly, ramming the boat's hull and killing the power. The men work through the night, {{repairing}} the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons another barrel into the shark. The line {{is tied to the}} stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backwards, swamping the deck and flooding the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> before breaking the cleats off. He then heads toward shore, intending to lure the shark to shallower waters and suffocate it, but the overtaxed engine fails.|$|E
5000|$|The {{locomotive}} has {{a chassis}} with two axles and welded frame. Bushing bumpers, screw and air couplings are mounted {{to the front}} and back of the frameThe body of the locomotive is composed of two <b>engine</b> <b>compartments</b> (front and back) and the elevated engineer compartment in between. The <b>compartments</b> are welded. <b>Engine</b> <b>compartments</b> have doors on all sides, providing convenient access to all the systems inside.The engineer compartment has large front, back and side windows with hand-powered wipers.

5|$|HB1002 {{was lost}} on 11July1979 during the aircraft's 52nd flight. A {{hydraulic}} leak caused an engine fire, {{resulting in the}} loss of hydraulic pressure, which in turn caused severe pitch oscillations. The pilot ejected safely, and the aircraft was destroyed. It was later discovered that an engine exhaust clamp had loosened, allowing the hot exhaust to migrate to the right <b>engine</b> <b>compartment.</b> The heat built up there, causing the hydraulic lines to fail. The debris from both aircraft was secretly buried somewhere within the Nellis complex. Despite the crashes, Have Blue was considered a success.|$|E
5|$|Later, in Boston, Fox Mulder and Dana Scully {{investigate}} {{the disappearance of}} Dr. Craig Horning, an archaeologist from a local history museum, after a security guard discovers {{a large amount of}} blood in Horning's lab. They interview both the curator, Dr. Lewton, and graduate student Mona Wustner. They also visit a reclusive Bilac. After closing, Lewton is killed by the jaguar spirit after his car doesn't start. During an investigation of the crime scene, Scully comes across rat corpses in the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> of Lewton's vehicle. Mona denies that anything unusual has happened in the museum.|$|E
5|$|The 2001 dive season {{concentrated}} on raising the ship's steam engine and condenser. Hull plates {{had to be}} removed to access the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> and both the engine and the condenser had to be separated from the ship, the surrounding wreckage and each other. A Mini Rover ROV was used to provide visibility of the wreck and divers to the support staff above water. The engine was raised on 16 July and the condenser three days later by the crane barge Wotan. Saturation diving was evaluated by the Navy that dive season on Monitor and proved to be very successful, allowing divers to maximize their time on the bottom. The surface-supplied divers evaluated the use of heliox due to the depth of the wreck. It also proved to be successful once the dive tables were adjusted.|$|E

2500|$|An {{outgrowth}} of the popularity of cruising sailing catamarans are powered catamarans, which share many of the amenities found in a sail cruising catamaran. [...] The saloon typically spans two hulls wherein are found the staterooms and <b>engine</b> <b>compartments.</b> As with sailing catamarans, this configuration minimizes boat motion in a seaway.|$|R
50|$|Traditional sound {{absorbers}} are {{porous materials}} such as mineral wool, glass or polyester fibres. It {{is not possible to}} use these materials in harsh environments such as <b>engine</b> <b>compartments.</b> Traditional absorbers have many drawbacks, including pollution, the risk of fire, and problems with the useful lifetime of the absorbing material.|$|R
5|$|Hulls of twin-turreted T-26s were {{assembled}} using armoured plates {{riveted to}} a frame from metal angles. Some tanks, produced in 1931, had sealing zinc shims at the hull bottom between armoured plates for fording water obstacles. After problems with rain entering the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment,</b> a special cover was installed over an air outlet window after March 1932. Some T-26s produced {{at the end}} of 1932–1933 had a riveted and welded hull. The T-26 mod. 1931 had two cylindrical turrets mounted on ball bearings; each turret turned independently through 240°. Both turrets could provide common fire in front and rear arcs of fire (100° each). The disadvantage of such a configuration was that not all of the tank's firepower could be used at once on the same side. Four turret modifications existed, and they were mounted on tanks in different combinations (for instance, a tank with a riveted hull could have riveted and welded turrets).|$|E
5|$|The command {{variant of}} the Tiger II was {{designated}} Panzerbefehlswagen Tiger Ausf. B. It had two versions, Sd.Kfz. 267 and Sd.Kfz. 268. These carried only 63 rounds of 8.8cm ammunition to provide room to accommodate the extra radios and equipment, and had additional armour on the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment.</b> The Sd.Kfz. 267 was to have used FuG 8 and FuG 5 radio sets, with the most notable external changes being a two metre long rod antenna mounted on the turret roof and a Sternantenne D ("Star antenna D"), mounted on an insulated base (the 105mm Antennenfuß Nr. 1), which was protected by a large armoured cylinder. This equipment was located on the rear decking in a position originally used for deep-wading equipment. The Sd.Kfz. 268 used FuG 7 and FuG 5 radios with a two-metre rod antenna mounted on the turret roof and a 1.4 metre rod antenna mounted on the rear deck.|$|E
5|$|Once the commandos {{finally got}} out of the tunnel, they both swam towards the {{broadside}} of Card which anchored near the opening of the sewer. As planned, Nao and Hung attached two bombs on the ship, with one near the bilge and one at the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment,</b> just above the water surface. After the bombs had been attached to Cards hull, Nao inspected both bombs to ensure they had been assembled properly. After that Nao stuck the battery onto a pole and connected it to the bombs with wires, then set the timer. At 1.10am, the bombs were completed and both commandos retreated back into the sewer tunnel, and climbed into their canoes {{on the other side and}} rowed back to Thu Thiem. Again, the police patrol boat was waiting for Nao and Hung to arrive, because the commander wanted another bribe. As Nao and Hung approached the patrol boat, an explosion was heard and a bright light could be seen in the commercial port area. The South Vietnamese police patrol boat than started its engine and raced towards Card, instead of extracting another bribe.|$|E
50|$|Space in {{the rear}} is most noticeably absent in terms of {{longitudinal}} leg-room. This is again often due to the low roof line, and other elements of body styling, in addition to large <b>engine</b> <b>compartments</b> and sometimes also large areas given over to the convertible roof {{in the case of}} a 2+2 convertible.|$|R
5000|$|The tank {{featured}} such advanced {{features as}} a main cannon mounted {{on top of the}} tank in a central revolving turret, separate fighting and <b>engine</b> <b>compartments,</b> a rear-mounted <b>engine</b> and a low track run.Neither the ordered test models nor the improved [...] "Oberschlesien II" [...] already planned were finished {{before the end of the}} war.|$|R
50|$|STS Acoustics is a {{provider}} of sound and heat absorption solutions for the <b>engine</b> <b>compartments</b> and interiors of vehicles. STS Acoustics employs around 730 employees across its five sites in Italy. Its customer base includes truck manufacturers such as Iveco, Volvo, Scania and Daimler, as well as Italian automobile manufacturers such as Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Ferrari and Maserati.|$|R
5|$|At this time, other Hurricanes {{were already}} in action with Bf 110s from Zerstörergeschwader 26 (ZG 26). The Irish ace Timber Woods {{attacked}} a formation of Bf 110s positioned above him. One of the Bf 110s detached itself and dived on the RAF pilot. Pattle, instinctively knowing that the German had the advantage and the Hurricane pilot had acted foolishly, dived toward the Bf 110. He engaged the Bf 110, knowing he too would likely be followed and attacked from behind. He succeeded in shooting it down in flames, but not before it had fired at point-blank range into the Hurricane, with the same effect. Woods died when his fighter crashed into the harbour. Pattle avoided a German counter-attack and climbed instead of attempting a dive, since the Bf 110s could out-dive the Hurricane. He fired into another Bf 110 and avoided a collision with a third. No RAF pilot saw Pattle die for certain. Jimmy 'Kettle' Kettlewell, one of Pattle's unit, {{arrived on the scene}} moments after Pattle had scored his victory. He saw a lone Hurricane diving towards the sea, its pilot slumped forward over the controls and flames engulfing the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment.</b> Two Bf 110s were still firing at it. Seizing the opportunity, he engaged and shot one of them down watching it and the Hurricane hit the sea simultaneously. Kettle did not specify the fate of the German crew — the victory was his fifth, making him an ace. It is possible Kettlewell's victim was one of two 5./ZG 26 Bf 110s that were lost: Bf 110E, Wrk Nr. 4272, Oberfeldwebel Georg Leinfelder and Unteroffizier Franz Beckel who were killed in action or Bf 110E, Wrk Nr 4299, Oberleutnant Kurt Specka and Günther Frank. A third Bf 110 crash-landed with severe damage. Kettlewell was shot down and wounded in the same battle.|$|E

25|$|The class 401 power car {{includes}} {{the cab and}} the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment.</b> Besides the driver's seat and controls, the cab features a second seat and several controls behind the seats. The <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> has a central corridor with door at both ends {{as well as a}} door {{on each side of the}} power car.|$|E
5000|$|Small sets {{of windows}} in the {{dividers}} between the passenger, luggage space and <b>engine</b> <b>compartments,</b> plus louvres providing air for the air-cooled engine, allowed limited rear visibility. Its entire rear segment could be opened, to service the engine. The front doors are [...] "suicide doors" [...] (i.e. rear-hinged doors), whereas the rear doors open in an orthodox manner.|$|R
50|$|The term {{firewall}} is also {{commonly used}} in American English {{to refer to the}} barrier between the passenger and <b>engine</b> <b>compartments</b> of a vehicle. The inner and outer surfaces of the firewall are often coated with noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) absorber to prevent most engine noise from reaching the passenger compartment. In British English, the term for this barrier is bulkhead.|$|R
40|$|The {{release and}} {{transport}} of a suppressant agent into an enclosed compartment {{is sensitive to}} local geo-metrical features or “clutter ” {{that is difficult to}} resolve numerically without using an excessively large CFD grid. Such examples include wire bundles or hydraulic lines in <b>engine</b> <b>compartments</b> of either ground vehicles or aircraft. Capturing these features on a grid will result in extremely small time step...|$|R
25|$|The JLTV {{also has}} an {{automatic}} fire-extinguishing system to protect the crew cabin and <b>engine</b> <b>compartment.</b> Fires in the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> are to be detected and extinguished within 10 seconds to minimize vehicle damage. In addition, the driver also has access to a small portable fire extinguisher. Fixed fuel tanks are self-sealing, mounted externally and shielded by the JLTV structure. Each crew seat has a combined seat and blast restraint device. Ingress time for a crew of four in combat equipment is 30 seconds or less. Egress with B-kit doors is within 10 seconds.|$|E
25|$|The {{front grille}} {{of a vehicle}} is used to direct air {{directly}} into the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment.</b> In a streamlined design the air flows around the vehicle rather than through; however, the grille of a vehicle redirects airflow from around the vehicle to through the vehicle, which then increases the drag. In order to reduce this impact a grille block is often used. A grille block covers up a portion, or {{the entirety of the}} front grille of a vehicle. In most high efficiency models or vehicles with low drag coefficients there will be a very small grille already built into the design, therefore a grille block is unneeded. The grille in most production vehicles is built generally to have as much air flowing into the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> in order to keep it from overheating. But most commonly there is too much airflow into the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment,</b> preventing it from warming up in a timely manner, so a grille block is used to increase engine performance and reduce the vehicle's drag.|$|E
25|$|The AB was {{identical}} to the AA {{except that it was}} a convertible with a folding cloth roof, the rear doors opened forwards like conventional doors and the front glass could fold down onto the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment.</b>|$|E
50|$|Japanese {{automakers}} {{have used}} the straight-six since the 1960s {{in a wide range}} of vehicles. More recently though, Nissan (the 1984 300ZX switched to V6) and Toyota have changed to V6s, saying the straight-sixes were too expensive to manufacture and too long for the <b>engine</b> <b>compartments</b> in their newer vehicles. The Nissan Skyline GT-R, however, continued using the straight-six layout and so had a long hood.|$|R
50|$|Volvo has {{a special}} version of the D5 {{for use in the}} C30, S40, V50 and C70 models that {{produces}} 180 hp and 400 Nm of torque (reduced to 350 Nm with automatic transmission). The <b>engine</b> <b>compartments</b> of these cars are smaller so among other things the engine has a different air intake system, different exhaust system, smaller charge air cooler and a smaller radiator.|$|R
50|$|The {{configuration}} {{results in}} inherently good {{balance of the}} reciprocating parts, a low centre of gravity, and a very short engine length. The layout also lends itself to efficient air cooling with excellent thermal balance. However, it is an expensive design to manufacture, and somewhat too wide for compact automobile <b>engine</b> <b>compartments,</b> which makes it more suitable for cruising motorcycles and aircraft than ordinary passenger cars.|$|R
25|$|The {{driver is}} located {{somewhat}} {{to the middle}} of the hull, just in front of the turret. The troop compartment is located behind the driver's position and the turret. The <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> is at the rear of the hull.|$|E
25|$|The T-34 gearbox {{had four}} forward and one reverse gear, {{replaced}} by a five-speed box on {{the last of the}} Model 1943s. The earlier transmissions were troublesome, and some tanks went into battle with a spare transmission cabled onto the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> deck.|$|E
25|$|According to GM's global product {{development}} chief Mark Reuss, the North America version Cruze is modified {{from the global}} platform as it requires reinforcements to the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> because it offers a bigger engine than in other markets and uses torsion beam suspension.|$|E
50|$|An engine crane (also {{referred}} as engine hoist) {{is a common}} repair tool used in vehicle repair shops to remove or install gasoline or diesel engines in small and crowded vehicle <b>engine</b> <b>compartments.</b> It uses a heavy cantilevered support structure to hold the engine in mid-air so that the mechanic can carefully connect or disconnect fragile hoses and wires on the engine to {{the frame of the}} vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|The FF {{transverse}} engine layout (also known as [...] "east-west") restricts {{the size of}} the engine that can be placed in modern <b>engine</b> <b>compartments,</b> so it is rarely adopted by powerful luxury and sports cars. FF configurations can usually only accommodate Inline-4 and V6 engines, while longer engines such as Inline-6 and 90° big-bore V8 will rarely fit, though there are exceptions. One way around this problem is using a staggered engine.|$|R
5000|$|VMV 3: The first VMV {{order was}} {{partially}} placed at Ares motorverkstad (the engine) and partly from E. Suortin Veneveistämö in Helsinki (the hull) in December 1929 [...] The boat was ready by November 1930. The vessel was destroyed {{on the very}} first day of service, due to a fire in the <b>engine</b> <b>compartments</b> on 10 June 1931. The fire caused great damage to the ship and the boat had to be scrapped soon thereafter.|$|R
