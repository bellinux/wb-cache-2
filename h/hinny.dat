5|$|Familiar {{examples}} of equid hybrids are the mule, {{a cross between}} a female horse and a male donkey, and the <b>hinny,</b> {{a cross between a}} female donkey and a male horse. Pairs of complementary types like the mule and <b>hinny</b> are called reciprocal hybrids.|$|E
5|$|Equine {{species can}} crossbreed with each other. The most common hybrid is the mule, {{a cross between}} a male donkey and a female horse. With rare exceptions, these hybrids are sterile and cannot reproduce. A related hybrid, a <b>hinny,</b> is {{a cross between a}} male horse and a female donkey. Other hybrids include the zorse, a cross between a zebra and a horse and a zonkey or zedonk, a hybrid of a zebra and a donkey. In areas where Grévy's zebras are {{sympatric}} with plains zebras, fertile hybrids do occur.|$|E
5|$|The North {{is known}} for its often crumbly cheeses, of which Cheshire cheese is the {{earliest}} example. Unlike Southern cheeses like Cheddar, Northern cheeses typically use uncooked milk and a pre-salted curd pressed under enormous weights, resulting in a moist, sharp-tasting cheese. Wensleydale, another crumbly cheese, is unusual in that it is often served as a side to sweet cakes, which are themselves well represented in Northern England. Parkin, an oatmeal cake with black treacle and ginger, is a traditional treat across the North on Bonfire Night, and the fruity scone-like singing <b>hinny</b> and fat rascal are popular in the North East and Yorkshire respectively.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hinnies</b> are {{difficult}} to obtain because {{of the differences in}} the number of chromosomes of the horse and the donkey. A donkey has 62 chromosomes, whereas a horse has 64. <b>Hinnies,</b> being hybrids of those two species, have 63 chromosomes and are sterile. The uneven number of chromosomes results in an incomplete reproductive system. According to the ADMS: [...] "The equine hybrid is easier to obtain when the lower chromosome count, the donkey, is in the male. Therefore breeding for <b>hinnies</b> is more hit-and-miss than breeding for mules." ...|$|R

25|$|A male donkey (jack) can be crossed with {{a female}} horse to produce a mule. A male horse can be crossed {{with a female}} donkey to produce a <b>hinny.</b>|$|E
25|$|Donkeys can interbreed {{with other}} members of the family Equidae, and are {{commonly}} interbred with horses. The hybrid between a jack and a mare is a mule, valued as a working and riding animal in many countries. Some large donkey breeds such as the Asino di Martina Franca, the Baudet de Poitou and the Mammoth Jack are raised only for mule production. The hybrid between a stallion and a jenny is a <b>hinny,</b> and is less common. Like other inter-species hybrids, mules and hinnies are usually sterile. Donkeys can also breed with zebras in which the offspring is called a zonkey (among other names).|$|E
25|$|The {{offspring}} of a zebra-donkey cross {{is called a}} zonkey, zebroid, zebrass, or zedonk; zebra mule is an older term, but still used in some regions today. The foregoing terms generally refer to hybrids produced by breeding a male zebra to a female donkey. Zebra <b>hinny,</b> zebret and zebrinny all refer to the cross of a female zebra with a male donkey. Zebrinnies are rarer than zedonkies because female zebras in captivity are most valuable when used to produce full-blooded zebras. There are not enough female zebras breeding in captivity to spare them for hybridizing; {{there is no such}} limitation on the number of female donkeys breeding.|$|E
5000|$|Common wisdom {{states that}} hybrids occur {{only when the}} zebra is the sire, but the Barbados hybrid {{demonstrates}} otherwise. Two other known zebra <b>hinnies</b> have been foaled, but did not survive to adulthood. The rarity of zebra <b>hinnies</b> indicates the smaller number of chromosomes must generally be on the male side if a viable hybrid is to be produced. Before this comes into account, a successful mating needs to be accomplished in the first place.|$|R
50|$|Messara ponies {{are used}} for light farm work and for {{transportation}} but more often are also being used for riding and racing. The stallions are often crossed with female donkeys (Jennies) to produce <b>hinnies.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{is harder}} to cross species if the female has less {{chromosomes}} than the males, as in the crossing of a stallion and a jenny (female donkey), this results in minimal breeding of <b>hinnies.</b>|$|R
500|$|Horses can crossbreed {{with other}} members of their genus. The most common hybrid is the mule, a cross between a [...] "jack" [...] (male donkey) and a mare. A related hybrid, a <b>hinny,</b> is a cross between a {{stallion}} and a jenny (female donkey). Other hybrids include the zorse, a cross between a zebra and a horse. With rare exceptions, most hybrids are sterile and cannot reproduce.|$|E
2500|$|A spotted ass is {{any kind}} of donkey, mule or <b>hinny</b> that has a spotted coat. [...] To be {{registered}} with the American Council of Spotted Asses, the animal must {{have at least two}} spots behind the throatlatch and above the legs.|$|E
2500|$|A male donkey or ass {{is called}} a jack, a female a jenny or jennet; a young donkey is a foal.

50|$|The {{different}} {{number and}} different structure in chromosomes {{makes it difficult}} for them to pair up. Donkeys have 62 chromosomes, mules and <b>hinnies</b> have 63 pair of chromosomes and horses have 64 pair of chromosomes.|$|R
40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} of Leydig {{cells of}} horses, asses and <b>hinnies</b> {{was compared to}} show the morphological differences among them. These cells have a well developed smooth endoplasmic reticulum, indicating a normal steroidogenic activity, but in the horse, this organelle {{seems to be a}} litle more abundant. The mitochondria was round, small and numerous. In asses and <b>hinnies</b> a great amount of microfilaments appear mainly near the nucclei. The function of these filaments is unknown, because there is no aparent reason for these cells to have a well developed cytoskeletal since they are imobile and don't have a supporting function, except, by, the steroids precursors and intracellular organelles transport...|$|R
50|$|Mules and <b>hinnies</b> have 63 chromosomes, {{a mixture}} of the horse's 64 and the donkey's 62. The {{different}} structure and number usually prevents the chromosomes from pairing up properly and creating successful embryos, rendering most mules infertile.|$|R

5|$|Interspecific hybrids are bred by mating {{individuals}} from two species, normally {{from within the}} same genus. The offspring display traits and characteristics of both parents, but are often sterile, preventing gene flow between the species. Sterility is often attributed to the different number of chromosomes between the two species. For example, donkeys have 62 chromosomes, horses have 64 chromosomes, and mules or <b>hinnies</b> have 63 chromosomes. Mules, <b>hinnies,</b> and other normally sterile interspecific hybrids cannot produce viable gametes, because differences in chromosome structure prevent appropriate pairing and segregation during meiosis, meiosis is disrupted, and viable sperm and eggs are not formed. However, fertility in female mules has been reported with a donkey as the father.|$|R

50|$|Strictly speaking, {{by analogy}} to hybrids between horses and donkeys, the term mulard or moulard should be {{reserved}} for offspring where the parental drake is a muscovy and the duck is a pekin. When the drake is a pekin, the offspring tend to be smaller and are called <b>hinnies.</b>|$|R
50|$|Peneias {{are used}} as draft animals, pack animals, and mounts for riding and jumping.

60|$|These several remarks are {{apparently}} applicable to animals; but {{the subject is}} here excessively complicated, partly owing {{to the existence of}} secondary sexual characters; but more especially owing to prepotency in transmitting likeness running more strongly in one sex than in the other, both when one species is crossed with another, and when one variety is crossed with another variety. For instance, I think those authors are right, who maintain that the ass has a prepotent power over the horse, so that both the mule and the <b>hinny</b> more resemble the ass than the horse; but that the prepotency runs more strongly in the male-ass than in the female, so that the mule, which is the offspring of the male-ass and mare, is more like an ass, than is the <b>hinny,</b> which is the offspring of the female-ass and stallion.|$|E
