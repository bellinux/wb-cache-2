40|$|To predict {{impacts of}} ocean {{acidification}} and warming on {{the responses of}} marine populations, {{it is important to}} determine an organism’s capacity for phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptation. We determined the effects of near-future acidification and warming across the life cycle of Heliocidaris erythrogramma from fertilisation to metamorphosis in the progeny of 16 sire-dam crosses. Sources of variation in tolerance to warming (+ 3 °C) and acidification (- 0. 3 to – 0. 5 pH units) were investigated for fertilisation, larvae and juveniles. Across all life stages, maternal legacy was important, with <b>dam</b> <b>identity</b> significantly interacting with stressors. Across the genotypes tested, fertilisation was negatively affected by increased temperature, but not low pH. Larval development was compromised by low pH, but not increased temperature. By the juvenile stage, no impact of warming or acidification was evident, likely due to selective mortality of sensitive individuals, indicating the presence of a subset of resilient progeny. Across all treatments, the juveniles exhibited a similar ability to calcify. The impact of treatments on development was influenced by parental identity, with the offspring of some sire-dam pairs more sensitive than others. That the progeny of some sire-dam pairs showed high stress tolerance indicates the potential for selection of resistant genotypes and adaptation that could facilitate the persistence of H. erythrogramma populations. Performance of progeny was not consistent across development, with the impact of stressors differing depending on developmental stage. This shows the importance of assessing climatic change across multiple stages in the life cycle...|$|E
40|$|Background: Predicting {{effects of}} rapid climate change on populations depends on {{measuring}} {{the effects of}} climate stressors on performance, and potential for adaptation. Adaptation to stressful climatic conditions requires heritable genetic variance for stress tolerance present in populations. Methodology/Principal Findings: We quantified genetic variation in tolerance of early development of the ecologically important sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii to near-future (2100) ocean conditions projected for the southeast Australian global change hot spot. Multiple dam-sire crosses were used to quantify {{the interactive effects of}} warming (+ 2 – 4 °C) and acidification (− 0. 3 − 0. 5 pH units) across twenty-seven family lines. Acidification, but not temperature, decreased the percentage of cleavage stage embryos. In contrast, temperature, but not acidification decreased the percentage of gastrulation. Cleavage success in response to both stressors was strongly affected by sire identity. Sire and <b>dam</b> <b>identity</b> significantly affected gastrulation and both interacted with temperature to determine developmental success. Positive genetic correlations for gastrulation indicated that genotypes that did well at lower pH also did well in higher temperatures. Conclusions/Significance: Significant genotype (sire) by environment interactions for both stressors at gastrulation indicated the presence of heritable variation in thermal tolerance and the ability of embryos to respond to changing environments. The significant influence of dam may be due to maternal provisioning (maternal genotype or environment) and/or offspring genotype. It appears that early development in this ecologically important sea urchin is not constrained in adapting to the multiple stressors of ocean warming and acidification. The presence of tolerant genotypes indicates the potential to adapt to concurrent warming and acidification, contributing to the resilience of C. rodgersii in a changing ocean...|$|E
40|$|Both inter- and intrasexual {{selection}} {{have been}} implicated in the origin and maintenance of species-rich taxa with diverse sexual traits. Simultaneous disruptive selection by female mate choice and male-male competition can, in theory, lead to speciation without geographical isolation if both act on the same male trait. Female mate choice can generate discontinuities in gene flow, while male-male competition can generate negative frequency-dependent selection stabilizing the male trait polymorphism. Speciation may be facilitated when mating preference and/or aggression bias are physically linked to the trait they operate on. We tested for genetic associations among female mating preference, male aggression bias and male coloration in the Lake Victoria cichlid Pundamilia. We crossed females from a phenotypically variable population with males from both extreme ends of the phenotype distribution in the same population (blue or red). Male offspring of a red sire were significantly redder than males of a blue sire, indicating that intra-population variation in male coloration is heritable. We tested mating preferences of female offspring and aggression biases of male offspring using binary choice tests. There was no evidence for associations at the family level between female mating preferences and coloration of sires, but <b>dam</b> <b>identity</b> {{had a significant effect}} on female mate preference. Sons of the red sire directed significantly more aggression to red than blue males, whereas sons of the blue sire did not show any bias. There was a positive correlation among individuals between male aggression bias and body coloration, possibly due to pleiotropy or physical linkage, which could facilitate the maintenance of color polymorphism [Current Zoology 59 (2) : 221 - 229, 2013]. ...|$|E
40|$|Merinos are the {{predominant}} sheep breed in Australia, accounting-for about 76 % {{of a total}} of 150 m. Approximately 197, 000 Merino rams are sold annually, of which 157, 000 are horned and 40, 000 are polled. The Australian Merino is above all a producer of premium quality white wool. The major determinant of wool income is weight, but the price per kilogram is influenced mainly by fibre diameter. Recording in Merino stud flocks is minimal. Sires are sometimes identified but <b>dam</b> <b>identities</b> are not routinely recorded. Neither are required for registration purposes. Subjective grading of breeding stock is still the main selection criterion, but there is an increasing emphasis on wool testing data. Several past attempts to design and establish recording services aimed at flocks with some pedigree information have been largely ignored by Merino breeders. However, successful testing services based on fibre diameter measurement and either greasy or clean fleece weights have been set up by some of the State Departments of Agriculture, the Australian Wool Testing Authority, the School of Wool and Pastoral Sciences (Univ. of N. S. W.) and by private consultants and are well supported. WOOLPLAN is an attempt to rationalize and integrate testing services and extend them to incorporate the recording requirements of studs producing rams for commercial flocks in which wool is an important, though not the sole, source of income...|$|R
