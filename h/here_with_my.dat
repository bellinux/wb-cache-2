500|$|The imposed {{regimen of}} asylum life gave van Gogh a hard-won stability: [...] "I feel happier <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> work than I could be outside. By staying here {{a good long}} time, I shall have learned regular habits {{and in the long}} run the result will be more order in my life." [...] While his time at Saint-RÃ©my forced him to manage his vices, such as coffee, alcohol, poor eating habits and {{periodic}} attempts to consume turpentine and paint, his stay was not ideal. [...] He needed to obtain permission to leave the asylum grounds. The food was poor; he generally ate only bread and soup. [...] His only apparent form of treatment were two-hour baths twice a week. During his year there, van Gogh had periodic attacks, possibly due to a form of epilepsy. By early 1890, when the attacks worsened, he concluded that his stay at the asylum was not helping him to recover, which led him to move to Auvers-sur-Oise just north of Paris in May 1890.|$|E
500|$|Jackson has had {{multiple}} injuries. In 2008, after the Olympics, she had surgery to fix her ankle. In 2009, {{she had two}} stress fractures in her back. In December 2010, she had an Achilles injury. [...] She sustained the injury playing in Australia. Between January 2011 and February 2012, she had surgeries to assist with Achilles and hip injuries. She had surgery on her left hip acetabular labrum in June 2011 in Vail, Colorado at the Richard Steadman Clinic. [...] She said of the surgery: [...] "This is a really, really tough decision, but after talking with my doctors and my family, we felt that immediate surgery is {{the best course of}} action. With something painful like this hip injury, I want to be especially proactive. I plan to stay in Seattle to be <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> team and try my best to be back on the court as soon as possible. My goal is to be at full strength {{by the end of the}} season." [...] She did rehab twice a day in an attempt to speed recovery. Afterwards, Jackson injured her right knee, requiring surgery in 2012. Another knee injury while playing in China in 2014 degraded into arthritis and required many surgical intervention in the following years, including a hospitalization in January 2016 once the operated knee joint got infected. All the consequences of this knee problem lead to Jackson's retirement in March. Jackson has expressed interest in undergoing a knee reconstruction, as [...] "I don't want to walk with a limp for the rest of my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the movie}} The Ex [...] Wesley (Lucian Maisel) states, [...] "So {{during the school}} year I live with my mom in New Jersey. And I spend the summer <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> dad. But he's at work all the time, and all my friends live back in Parsippany, so it's pretty gay." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{directed}} mindfulness {{so that it}} {{was keeping}} closely aware of the mind, following it to know what happens at death. Mindfulness stayed with the heart right up to the final moment when only the barest awareness remained. A feeling was present that to release that faint degree of awareness would be death. At this point, the question became whether {{it would be better for}} me to let go and allow death to take place. I felt that my heart was currently quite pure and that if I were to let go, I wouldn't lose because of it. Although there also remained a delicate feeling that expressed the thought that: 'rather than letting go and die, by remaining alive, I could continue to be of benefit to other people. If it were all to finish <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> death, then it could only be to my own purely personal advantage. Also, people wouldn't know the full circumstances and causes of this death. If that's the case, it's certainly better not to let myself die.' I therefore attempted to wiggle and move my hands and feet, until I came around." ...|$|E
