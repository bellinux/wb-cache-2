5|$|<b>Double</b> <b>deck</b> buses show an {{intermediate}} points display, {{as well as}} a final destination. The company's double decker buses are unique in Scotland in still displaying the destination at both the front and rear. In early mornings and late evenings, some services are curtailed to the city centre or to early termini, in the transition to the night bus service. In such cases, 'Part Route' is displayed in the intermediate display. Certain routes have all day short working termini, and minor diversions which are often indicated through the use of internal or external 'tram boards'. Since 2006 double-deck deliveries feature a 'Route Diverted; intermediate display, used when road closures cause a service to be diverted from its normal route.|$|E
5|$|The large Goodyear fan-belt factory at Silverwood Industrial Estate was {{a product}} of the Craigavon {{development}} when large tracts of land in Lurgan, Portadown, and areas in between were zoned off for exclusive industrial use. The Goodyear factory closed in 1983 after failing to make a profit, resulting in the loss of 750 jobs. The facility was later partly occupied by Wilson <b>Double</b> <b>Deck</b> Trailers and DDL Electronics. Silverwood Industrial Estate continues to host other manufacturing and light engineering firms. Other industrial areas in the town are Annesborough and Halfpenny Valley (Portadown Road) industrial estates; areas in which growth has been limited compared to other industrial estates in the Craigavon Borough.|$|E

50|$|By {{the end of}} 1970 {{a further}} 46 chassis had been built, bodied and delivered. Production then rose to a peak of 109 (including the second prototype) in 1971, {{dropping}} back slightly in 1972 to 99 then only 13 were delivered in 1973 and six in 1974, so 76% of chassis were built in two years, the municipal market was moving back toward <b>double</b> <b>decks</b> and the rival Leyland National was outselling every other single-deck bus.|$|R
25|$|In 1992, McDonnell Douglas {{unveiled}} {{a study of}} a <b>double</b> <b>deck</b> jumbo-sized aircraft designated MD-12. Despite briefly leaving the market, the study was perceived as merely a public relations exercise to disguise the fact that MDC was struggling under intense pressure from Boeing and Airbus. It was clear to most in the industry that MDC had neither the resources nor the money to develop such a large aircraft, and the study quickly sank without a trace. A similar <b>double</b> <b>deck</b> concept was used in Boeing's later Ultra-Large Aircraft study intended to replace the 747, but ultimately the <b>double</b> <b>deck</b> concept would not {{see the light of}} day until the Airbus A380 in the 2000s.|$|E

25|$|In the United Kingdom, due to {{the small}} loading gauge, the railway system cannot {{accommodate}} double-deck trains. A modest attempt at <b>double</b> <b>decking</b> was made in 1948 on the Southern Railway with the two trains of the Bulleid 4DD class. Although innovative, with stepped compartments, where the bottoms of the upper seats are above {{the heads of the}} people on the lower level, but the feet of the people above are not, the loading gauge severely restricted their use and they were removed from service in 1971.|$|R

50|$|By the 1990s, it {{was time}} for the bridge to be either {{significantly}} upgraded or replaced. A number of different proposals were considered, including building a new bridge beside the existing bridge, building a tunnel from Downtown Vancouver to the north shore, or <b>double</b> <b>decking</b> the existing bridge. However, none of the proposals could overcome the City of Vancouver's objections to any increase in traffic into the downtown core and the province's unwillingness to spend much money on the project. In the end, it was decided to upgrade the existing bridge without adding any new lanes.|$|R

40|$|Abstract:-This paper {{describes}} {{a new type}} of bituminous concrete with frame–separation in steel-structure bridge deck pavement, the lower layer of which is designed to have a frame-separation structure with bituminous concrete units dependent from each other, while the upper layer is paved with fiber bituminous concrete. Pavement with this new structure has been successfully applied to a bridge with <b>double</b> <b>decks</b> for dual purposes of highway and railway use, which is able to restrain the pavement deformation caused by vibration within an acceptable limit and therefore can settle the maintenance and repair problem of the deck pavement of the bridge for dual purposes of highway and railway use...|$|R
