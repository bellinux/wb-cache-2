5000|$|Emmental (<b>Emmentaler</b> or Emmenthal) is a yellow, medium-hard Swiss cheese that {{originated}} {{in the area around}} Emmental, Canton Bern. It has a savory, but mild taste.

50|$|Jerry {{surveys the}} large array of cheeses and {{walks in the}} air towards a large wheel of <b>Emmentaler</b> cheese. He starts to dive {{in and out of}} the holes in the cheese as Tom manages to open the door. Only his tail remains unfrozen, and Tom uses it to push himself and to light a fire to defrost. Jerry starts to eat the <b>Emmentaler</b> and yodels. Tom hears and sees Jerry through the holes and pumps out the mouse with a {{fireplace}} Bellows, but he falls back in before Tom can grab him. The cat tries this some more before he comes up with another plan. He hammers corks into all of the holes (hitting Jerry on the head) and drops a giant weight on top of a giant bellows, which causes the cheese to burst and corks fly everywhere. Tom recovers from the storm to see much of the cheese gone and Jerry with a cheese-tutu. Jerry walks out, and seeing the tutu, does a brief dance (the music is a rendition of the Grande Valse Brillante, which is also heard in The Flying Cat). Tom claps as he approaches the mouse and then smacks Jerry between his paws, stunning the mouse and drops him outside in the snow.|$|E
50|$|The Emmental Alps (<b>Emmentaler</b> Alpen) are a {{mountain}} {{range in the}} western part of the Alps, in Switzerland.

The highest summit of the range is the Brienzer Rothorn, which is also the highest point in the canton of Lucerne. The range is named after the Emme valley (German: Emmental). In the north-west corner one finds the relatively low, but widespread, and very furrowed Napf.|$|E
50|$|Samsø is a Danish cow's milk cheese {{named after}} the island of Samsø. It was invented in the early 19th century when the king of Denmark invited Swiss cheesemakers to teach their skill. It is similar to <b>Emmentaler,</b> {{although}} its flavour is milder: gentle and nutty in young cheeses and pungent with sweet and sour notes in older ones. Samsø's interior has a supple, elastic texture; a yellow colour; and a few large, irregular holes. The cheese has goldenrod coloured rind covered with a yellow wax. It is the national cheese of Denmark.|$|E

In 2013, it {{was replaced by}} the appellation d'origine protégée (AOP) certification. This original Emmental is produced in small rural dairies with raw cow's milk, adding only natural ingredients (water, salt, natural starter cultures and rennet); preservatives or ingredients from genetically modified organisms are not allowed. The cheese is produced in a round shape with a natural rind, and aged in traditional cellars for a minimum of four months. This Emmental has three age profiles: classic - four months, reserve - eight months, and Premier Cru - 14 months.|$|E
50|$|Gotland Blue (Blå Gotland, Gotland Blau) is {{a cheese}} {{that was made}} in Sweden by the Arla Foods company {{in the town of}} Stånga on the island of Gotland. This cheese is often {{characterized}} as being somewhere between strong and mild, containing elements of both types. The colour is a pale yellow, with no holes. It is similar to <b>Emmentaler</b> in texture, but has a flavour reminiscent of stronger cheeses. The cheese is cube shaped and covered in a blue wax, thus making the cheese take on visual cues from the Swedish flag and national colours. Blå Gotland was sold in Sweden and in Germany.|$|E
50|$|The Käsekrainer is a {{variation}} of this sausage made with small chunks of cheese. Käsekrainer contains 10% to 20% cheese (e.g., <b>Emmentaler)</b> cut in small cubes. Käsekrainer were first made {{on a large scale}} in Austria in the early 1980s. Today they are a standard offering at sausage stands (Würstelstand). Käsekrainer can be boiled, baked or grilled. It is essential to keep them on low to medium heat; otherwise the outside is burned and the inside is still cold. Care should be taken when preparing them, because the cheese can become quite hot; the sausages should not be cut or poked while cooking, otherwise the melting cheese would be released.|$|E

50|$|Another {{very famous}} {{specialty}} that gained supra-regional and even supranational popularity is Spätzle which {{is for the}} Swabians {{the same as the}} potato is in Northern Germany: a universal side dish to meat dishes with sauces but also the main ingredient in stand-alone dishes. Used as an accompaniment to meat dishes they are commonly garnished with roasted onions and breadcrumbs which were browned in butter. One of the dishes featuring Spätzle as a main ingredient is Kässpätzle which is Spätzle that are cooked in salted water and then layered into a casserole with different kinds of cheese (commonly <b>Emmentaler</b> and Gruyère or even Weißlacker) and roasted onions. The kind of cheese used depends on the region of Swabia as this dish is not only famous in Germany but also in neighbouring Switzerland and Austria).As with many noodle products, Spätzle can also be featured in sweet dishes combined with sugar, apple sauce or other fruit preserves, but they are more famous in hearty dishes and this form of preparation is not too common.|$|E
40|$|<b>Emmentaler</b> is a {{hard cheese}} {{produced}} and consumed in many countries. The authenticity of this cheese variety is becoming {{a matter of national}} importance with the imminent opening of the cheese market in Switzerland and the introduction of the PDO label for the <b>Emmentaler</b> Switzerland™. This paper is {{the first in a series}} reporting the search for parameters that make possible a geographic discrimination of Emmentalers. Twenty <b>Emmentaler</b> cheese samples from six regions in Europe (one from Switzerland, two from France, one from Austria, one from Germany and one from Finland) were considered. In this paper, chemical, biochemical, microbiological, colour and sensory parameters were investigated leading to the following preliminary results. The presence of Lb. helveticus seemed to be a good indicator of an origin other than Swiss. The concentration of enterococci, facultative and obligate heterofermentative lactobacilli and salt tolerant bacteria was significantly lower in <b>Emmentaler</b> Switzerland™ than in the foreign cheeses. Chemical parameters such as fat content and pH value as well as biochemical parameters such as L- and D-lactate and pyruvate allowed us to partially discriminate between the regions when these data were combined by principal component analysis. The colour of the body also showed significant differences...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess Ca {{digestibility}} using in vitro and in vivo methodology (rats). The tested foods were: cheese (Grana Padano; <b>Emmentaler),</b> soybean-based products (tofu; burger; milk; yogurt), and legumes (peas; beans). Ca digestibility was found to be high in <b>Emmentaler</b> (84. 3 %), Grana Padano (83. 6 %) and tofu (80. 3 %), with significantly lower values for soya burgers (64. 1 %) and soya milk (60. 6 %). The lowest values were detected in peas (49. 6 %) and beans (31. 4 %). Poor correlation was found between in vivo and in vitro data. The current RDAs have been established on the basis of 30 % Ca digestibility, a value which reduces the risk of calcium deficiency but underestimates the contribution of dairy products. The adoption of specific, instead of general, digestibility values for each food might improve the accuracy of dietary formulations. This will require considerable efforts to develop simple and reliable in vitro methods to assess foods...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} basic chemical parameters of natural cheese, namely Camembert type (white mold cheese) and <b>Emmentaler</b> type (cheese with high-heat curd). Model samples of cheese were produced in a pilot plant using unpasteurized milk in"organic" quality. Based on the literature search following parameters suitable for simple and fast characterization of cheese composition were selected: dry matter (drying to constant weight), fat in dry matter (calculated), total nitrogen (resp. determination of protein content) by the Kjeldahl method and fats, resp. total lipids (extraction with solvent). The results were finally compared with samples of the corresponding cheese type purchased on the market...|$|E
