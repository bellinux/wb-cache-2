The results of the study showed that the clarity of the importance of human resources management electronically and the support of senior management are available and contribute greatly to the process of transition to electronic management in general and e-HRM in particular. There is clarity in the sample of the study of the importance of human resources management electronically, fully aware of their multiple benefits, this greatly helps to adopt and develop e-HRM and the development of the members of the study from the higher administrative levels and those who influence decision-making. The University's system of human resources management varies in different ways from one university to another and has a significant impact on human resources management electronically, and researchers explain this difference due to the different priorities of universities and their development plans and their material and human resources. The concept of <b>e-management</b> is a broad concept, encompassing several different electronic systems, and the transition to it requires extensive changes, from organizational structure to business processes. The most important electronic management systems that universities develop according to their need are electronic human resources systems. Universities also provide different means of communication with their employees using various ICT means such as e-mail and SMS. The use of e-HR forms is still very limited and greatly reduces e-HRM benefits. Self-service systems are not interrelated with pay and pay systems and researchers explain this because e-HRM systems are not complete at universities. Universities follow a strategy of combining traditional and electronic business, a positive indicator of the transition to <b>e-management.</b> The study reached several recommendations with the aim of benefiting from the promotion of the electronic management approach. The most important of these recommendations is the establishment of official and practical approaches to electronic administration and its systems.
