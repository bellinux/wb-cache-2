40|$|Gastrointestinal stomas are {{frequently}} {{applied in the}} practice of gastrointestinal surgery. Although the creation of a stoma is believed to be a relatively minor surgical procedure, complications are frequent and even with an uncomplicated postoperative surgical course, the emotional impact of a stoma can be quite negative. 1 The patient is faced with a profound change in body image and feelings of inadequacy and depression are common. The fear of stool leakage caused by the failure of appliances, ballooning of bags, bad odors and the necessity for further treatment are some of the daily problems that impacts on the quality of life (QOL) of these patients. 1 Most patients who receive stoma surgery, especially a permanent colostomy, have colorectal cancer. Therefore, they have to cope with a life threatening disease and the impact of surgery, both of which can significantly influence quality of life. 2 There are various techniques for management of faecal evacuation via colostomy: (1) natural spontaneous evacuation, (2) control of colostomy output by drugs, (3) colostomy irrigation which is a mechanical method to <b>empty</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowels</b> by installing liquid into the large intestine through the stoma; and (4) insertion of glycerine suppository into th...|$|E

30|$|Twenty-two {{women who}} had submucous myomas more than 5  cm {{underwent}} laparoscopic myomectomy. The mean age was 34  years. Eleven patients were nulliparous, six women had previous normal delivery and the other five had previous caesarean section. The indication for myomectomy was menorrhagia in all women, two complained of fibroid uterus and one had lump in the abdomen. The clinical size of the uterus varied from 6  weeks {{to a maximum of}} 18  weeks. The average maximum diameter of the myoma measured by ultrasonography was 7.5  cm. All patients underwent pelvic ultrasound examination and basic blood investigations. Patients were kept on a liquid diet 2  days before the procedure and a laxative was given 12  h before <b>the</b> surgery to <b>empty</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowel.</b> Antibiotic prophylaxis was given to all patients included in the study. Subcutaneous low-dose heparin and a sequential compression device were also given to all patients for prophylaxis against possible thromboembolic episodes.|$|R
30|$|When {{applied for}} use in the {{management}} of children with refractory constipation (with overflow incontinence) and fecal incontinence the appendix is mobilized, its distal end removed and the open end anastomosed to the skin of the anterior abdominal wall, typically at the umbilicus or in the right iliac fossa. Through this appendiceal channel washout enemas can be administered after which the child sits on <b>the</b> toilet to <b>empty</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowel</b> in a controlled manner. The enema is then repeated every day or on alternate days. During the intervals of enema administration <b>the</b> colon is <b>empty</b> and thus <b>the</b> child kept from being constipated or having episodes of fecal soiling/incontinence. Since its introduction in 1980 (Malone et al. 1980) this procedure- the Malone or MACE (Malone antegrade continence enema) has undergone many modifications and is now widely used in the management of refractory constipation and fecal incontinence in children with myelomeningoceles, neuropathic conditions for example spina bifida, anorectal malformations, Hirschsprung’s disease and chronic intractable constipation (Imai et al. 2014; Hoekstra et al. 2011; VanderBrink et al. 2013).|$|R

Because the society is traditionally patriarchal, the women were in charge of a relatively menial tasks, such as waiting and cooking for the whole crew throughout the event, keeping the environment clean (washing and scrubbing), as well as <b>the</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>the</b> pigs' <b>bowels</b> in order to make them suitable for holding sausage meat.|$|R
50|$|Later, a {{small amount}} of Croton oil was added to the neutral grain spirits which powered U.S. torpedoes. Drinking alcohol with the oil {{additive}} caused painful cramps, internal bleeding and a violent <b>emptying</b> of <b>the</b> <b>bowels.</b> It was intended as a replacement for methanol which had caused blindness in some sailors. To avoid the Croton oil, sailors devised crude stills to slowly separate the alcohol from the poison, as alcohol evaporated at a lower temperature than Croton oil. The stills were sometimes called 'Gilly' stills, and the resulting potable alcohol was known as 'gilly'.|$|R
50|$|Epiploic {{appendices}} are small, fat-filled sacs or finger-like projections {{along the}} surface of the upper and lower colon and rectum. They may become acutely inflamed as a result of torsion (twisting) or venous thrombosis. The inflammation causes pain, often described as sharp or stabbing, located on the left, right, or central regions of the abdomen. There is sometimes nausea and vomiting. The symptoms may mimic those of acute appendicitis, diverticulitis, or cholecystitis. The pain is characteristically intense during/after defecation or micturition (espec. in the segmoid type) due to the effect of traction on the pedicle of the lesion caused by straining and <b>emptying</b> of <b>the</b> <b>bowel</b> and bladder. Initial lab studies are usually normal. EA is usually diagnosed incidentally on CT scan which is performed to exclude more serious conditions.|$|R
25|$|Evacuation aids (suppositories or enemas) e.g. {{glycerine}} or bisacodyl suppositories may be prescribed. People {{may have}} poor resting {{tone of the}} anal canal, and consequently {{may not be able}} to retain an enema, in which case transanal irrigation (retrograde anal irrigation) may be a better option, as this equipment utilizes an inflatable catheter to prevent loss of the irrigation tip and to provide a water tight seal during irrigation. A volume of lukewarm water is gently pumped into the colon via the anus. People can be taught how to perform this treatment in their own homes, but it does require special equipment. If the irrigation is efficient, stool will not reach the rectum again for up to 48 hours. By regularly <b>emptying</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowel</b> using transanal irrigation, controlled bowel function is often re-established to a high degree in patients with bowel incontinence and/or constipation. This enables control over the time and place of evacuation and development of a consistent bowel routine. However, persistent leaking of residual irrigation fluid during the day may occur and make this option unhelpful, particularly in persons with obstructed defecation syndrome who may have incomplete evacuation of any rectal contents. Consequently, the best time to carry out the irrigation is typically in the evening, allowing any residual liquid to be passed the next morning before leaving the home. Complications such as electrolyte imbalance and perforation are rare. The effect of transanal irrigation varies considerably. Some individuals experience complete control of incontinence, and other report little or no benefit. It has been suggested that if appropriate, people be offered home retrograde anal irrigation.|$|R

Materials and methods: We compared patients referred to the urologic clinics for voiding dysfunction with age-matched controls without urinary complaints. Characteristics including age and reason for toilet training, method of training, and encopresis or constipation were compared between both groups. Results: Initiation of toilet training prior to 24 months and later than 36 months of age were associated with dysfunctional voiding. However, dysfunctional voiding due to late toilet training was also associated with constipation. Conclusion: Dysfunctional voiding {{may be due to}} delayed <b>emptying</b> of <b>the</b> <b>bowel</b> and bladder by children. The symptoms of dysfunctional voiding are more common when toilet training early, as immature children may be less likely to empty in a timely manner, or when training late due to (or in association with) constipation.

40|$|Background: Bowel {{problems}} such as constipation, diarrhoea and faecal incontinence (FI) are prevalent conditions among nursing home residents and {{little is known about}} nursing management. This study aimed to elucidate how Norwegian registered nurses (RNs) manage bowel problems among nursing home residents. Methods: A mixed methods approach was used combining quantitative data from a population-based cross-sectional survey and qualitative data from a focus group interview. In the cross sectional part of the study 27 of 28 nursing homes in one Norwegian municipality participated. Residents were included if they, at the time of data collection, had been a resident in a nursing home for more than three weeks or had prior stays of more than four weeks during the last six months. Residents were excluded from the study if they were younger than 65 years or had a stoma (N = 980 after exclusions). RNs filled in a questionnaire for residents regarding FI, constipation, diarrhoea, and treatments/ interventions. In the focus group interview, 8 RNs participated. The focus group interview used an interview guide that included six open-ended questions. Results: Pad use (88. 9 %) and fixed toilet schedules (38. 6 %) were the most commonly used interventions for residents with FI. In addition, the qualitative data showed that controlled <b>emptying</b> of <b>the</b> <b>bowels</b> with laxatives and/or enemas was common. Common interventions for residents with constipation were laxatives (66. 2 %) and enemas (47 %), dietary interventions (7. 3 %) and manual emptying of feces (6. 3 %). In addition, the qualitative data showed that the RNs also used fixed toilet schedules for residents with constipation. Interventions for residents with diarrhoea were Loperamide (18. 3 %) and dietary interventions (20. 1 %). RNs described bowel care management as challenging due to limited time and resources. Consequently, compromises were a part of their working strategies. Conclusions: Constipation was considered to be the main focus of <b>bowel</b> management. <b>Emptying</b> <b>the</b> residents’ <b>bowels</b> was <b>the</b> aim of nursing intervention. FI was mainly treated passively with pads and interventions for residents with diarrhoea were limited. The RNs prioritized routine tasks in the nursing homes due to limited resources, and thereby compromising with the resident’s need for individualized bowel care. © Saga et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. 2014.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} bowel problems, self-care practices, and information needs of patients who have recovered from the acute effects of sphincter-saving surgery for colorectal cancer. A retrospective, descriptive survey was conducted using a structured telephone interview and mailed questionnaires. The sample consisted of 101 patients who had undergone sphincter-saving surgery for colorectal cancer in the last 6 to 24 months. Most participants (71. 3 %) reported a change in bowel habits after surgery. The 6 most frequently reported gastrointestinal problems were incomplete evacuation (75. 2 %), excessive flatus (75. 2 %), urgency (73. 3 %), straining (61. 4 %), perianal soreness or itching (49. 5 %), and bloating (43. 6 %). Incontinence of feces (varying from smears to complete bowel action) was reported by 37. 6 % of participants. The most frequently reported information needs were related to diet (50. 5 %) and managing conditions such as diarrhea (31. 7 %), bloating/wind/gas (28. 7 %), pain (21. 8 %), and incomplete <b>emptying</b> of <b>the</b> <b>bowel</b> (18. 8 %).

40|$|Introduction Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) {{changes the}} way your body works, {{especially}} your bowels. After a spinal cord injury, bowel movements (or stool) require more time, thought and planning. Usually, people with SCI cannot feel when stool is ready to come out; therefore, their bowels need re-training. Anatomy What Is <b>the</b> <b>Bowel,</b> and What Does It Do? <b>The</b> <b>bowel</b> is <b>the</b> last portion of your digestive tract and is sometimes called the large intestine or colon. The digestive tract {{as a whole is}} a hollow tube that extends from the mouth to the anus (see illustration below). The function of the digestive system is to take food into the body, provide it with nutrients and get rid of waste. <b>The</b> <b>bowel</b> is where <b>the</b> waste products of eating are stored until they are <b>emptied</b> from <b>the</b> body {{in the form of a}} bowel movement (stool, feces). A bowel movement happens when the rectum (last portion of <b>the</b> <b>bowel)</b> becomes full of stool and the muscle around the anus (anal sphincter) opens. (25 pages, 612 Kb...|$|R
40|$|The afferent loop {{syndrome}} (ALS) {{is a well}} recognized {{complication of}} gastric surgery with a Billroth II anastomosis. The condition may be either acute or chronic; and the symptoms, including bilious vomiting, result from obstruction of the afferent loop. Depending {{on the degree of}} obstruction, radio logic visualization of the afferent loop may be very difficult (1). We recently examined a patient with symptoms suggestive of ALS, but an afferent loop could not be confirmed by conventional radiographic techniques. Radionuclide studies easily revealed its presence. CASEREPORT A 56 -year-old man was referred from another in stitution for evaluation of intractable nausea and vomiting. He had had a gastroectomy I 5 years ear her and apparently had done well until 2 years ago, when he underwent abdominal surgery for nephro lithiasis, with a subsequent cholecystectomy. No sun gical records were available for either operation. Afterwards he developed recurrent episodes of nau sea andvomiting, with severe burning pain in the chest and abdomen. These occurred most often at night and 30 mm after breakfast, consisted of emesis of a yellowishâ€”greenbilious material, usually with out food, and were often followed by diarrhea. No weight loss occurred. Routine blood studies showed elevation of the alkaline phosphatase, LDH, and SOOT. Barium ex amination of the upper gastrointestinal tract (UGI) failed to reveal an afferent loop despite attempts in various dependent positions.
