25|$|In {{the case}} of HMS Thetis, 4 members of the ship’s company, three RN {{personnel}} (Lieutenant Woods, Captain Oram and Leading Stoker Arnold) and one Cammell Laird’s employee (Fitter Shaw) successfully used the escape chamber. During the 5th attempt to escape the occupant of the chamber panicked and tried to open the outer <b>escape</b> <b>hatch</b> before the chamber had completely flooded. As a result, the increased pressure outside the submarine caused an in-rush of sea water, thus drowning the escapee. Because the outer <b>escape</b> <b>hatch</b> remained partially open it rendered the escape chamber inoperative, preventing the escape of any other crew members.|$|E
25|$|Except for Brophy, all {{crew members}} of the Lancaster managed to escape the burning bomber. Five left through the front <b>escape</b> <b>hatch</b> {{on the floor of}} the cockpit. When bomb aimer Jack Friday, tried to release the <b>escape</b> <b>hatch</b> cover in the aircraft's nose, the rushing wind ripped it from his hands. The hatch cover caught him above his left eye and knocked him out. He fell into the open hatch and jammed it closed until Flight {{engineer}} Roy Vigars reached him to quickly clip on Friday's parachute and toss him out the hatch while pulling the unconscious crewman's rip cord. Only Mynarski managed to leave via the rear escape door.|$|E

25|$|Russian Navy {{officials}} imposed specific {{constraints that}} restricted the Norwegians divers {{to work on}} the stern of the ship, specifically the <b>escape</b> <b>hatch</b> over compartment nine and an air control valve connected to the rescue trunk. The Norwegian deep-sea divers protested against the restrictions which they felt impeded their rescue operations.|$|E
25|$|There were 24 men {{assigned}} to compartments six through nine towards {{the rear of}} the ship. Of that number, 23 survived the two blasts and gathered in the ninth compartment, which had an <b>escape</b> <b>hatch.</b> Captain-lieutenant Dmitri Kolesnikov, head of the turbine in the seventh department, and one of three surviving officers of that rank, apparently took charge.|$|E

25|$|Analysis of {{the wreck}} could not {{determine}} whether the <b>escape</b> <b>hatch</b> was workable from the inside. Analysts theorise that the men may have rejected risking the <b>escape</b> <b>hatch</b> {{even if it were}} operable, and would have preferred to wait for a submarine rescue ship to attach itself to the hatch. The sub was relatively close to shore {{and in the middle of}} a large naval exercise. The sailors had every reason to believe that rescue would arrive quickly. Using the escape trunk was risky. The sailors were in a compartment that was initially at surface atmosphere pressure, so they did not risk decompression sickness ('the bends') if they used the rescue hoods to ascend to the surface. But the Arctic water was extremely cold and they could not survive long in the water. Also, water was slowly seeping into the ninth compartment, increasing the atmospheric pressure and thus the risk of decompression sickness and death when they ascended to the surface. In addition it was likely that some of the men were seriously injured and escape would have been very difficult for them.|$|E
25|$|Chief Petty Officer Jonathan Rogers was posthumously {{awarded the}} George Cross {{for his actions}} during the sinking. Recognising {{that he was too}} large to fit through the <b>escape</b> <b>hatch,</b> he {{organised}} the evacuation of those who could escape, then led those stuck in the compartment in prayers and hymns as they died. Posthumous Albert Medals for Lifesaving were awarded to Midshipman Kerry Marien and Electrical Mechanic William Corden for their actions in saving other Voyager personnel at the cost of their own lives. The awards were listed in the 19 March 1965 issue of the London Gazette, along with one George Medal, five British Empire Medals for Gallantry, and three Queen's Commendations for Brave Conduct for Voyager personnel.|$|E

25|$|Over four days, the Russian Navy used four {{different}} diving bells and submersibles {{to try to}} attach to the <b>escape</b> <b>hatch</b> without success. The navy's response was criticised as slow and inept. The government initially misled and manipulated the public and media {{about the timing of}} the accident, stating that communication had been established and that a rescue effort was under way, and refused help from other governments. On the fifth day, President Vladimir Putin authorised the navy to accept British and Norwegian offers of assistance. Seven days after the submarine went down, Norwegian divers finally opened a hatch to the escape trunk in the ship's ninth compartment, hoping to locate survivors, but found it flooded.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 December, Bhutto met with Afghan President Hamid Karzai. In the afternoon, she gave a speech at a PPP rally held in Rawalpindi's Liaquat National Bagh. On leaving in a {{bulletproof}} vehicle, she opened the car's <b>escape</b> <b>hatch</b> and stood up to wave to the surrounding crowds. A man stood within two to three metres of the car, fired three gunshots at her, and detonated a suicide vest packed with ball bearings. Bhutto was fatally injured; reports differ as to whether she was hit by bullets or by shrapnel from the explosion. Bhutto was rushed to Rawalpindi General Hospital, but was clinically dead on arrival and attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful. No autopsy was conducted, and the body was swiftly transported to Chaklala Air Base. The following day, she was buried next to her father in the Bhutto family mausoleum, Garhi Khuda Baksh, her family graveyard near Larkana. PPP supporters rioted {{in various parts of}} Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|It {{concludes that}} Debye's actions in 1933–45 {{were based on}} the nineteenth-century positivist view of science which saw {{research}} in physics as generating blessings for humankind. The report states that, by his contemporaries, Debye was considered an opportunist by some and as a man of highest character by others. The report asserts that Debye was not coerced by the Nazis into writing the infamous DPG Heil Hitler letter and that he also did not follow the lead of other societies in doing so but, rather, other societies followed his lead. The NIOD report also concludes that Debye felt obliged to send the letter and that it was, for him, simply a confirmation of an existing situation. The report argues that Debye, in the Third Reich, developed a survival method of ambiguity which allowed him to pursue his scientific career despite the political turmoil. Crucial to this survival method was the need to keep ready an <b>escape</b> <b>hatch,</b> for example in his secret dealings with the Nazis in 1941, if needed.|$|E

40|$|Many organisms show {{adaptive}} {{phenotypic plasticity}} {{in response to}} environmental variation. Some environmental factors may, however, impose constraints {{on the ability of}} organisms to respond to other factors. The neotropical treefrog Dendropsophus ebraccatus lays eggs both above water on leaves and directly in water, thereby exposing embryos to different abiotic conditions and predator communities. Rising pond levels can also flood arboreal clutches after rainstorms. We tested for predator-induced hatching in submerged and arboreal D. ebraccatus egg masses and assessed effects of prior hydration or desiccation on escape success in attacks by a terrestrial predator, Azteca ants, and an aquatic predator, large conspecific tadpoles. Embryos responded to both aquatic and terrestrial predator attacks by hatching prematurely, as much as 67 % earlier than the peak of hatching in undisturbed clutches. Desiccation reduced the hatching response of terrestrial embryos, resulting in substantially lower escape rates. This desiccation effect disappeared rapidly with flooding; all embryos showed high <b>escape</b> <b>hatching</b> success underwater. The occurrence of predator-induced <b>escape</b> <b>hatching</b> in response to 2 different predators, in 2 different physical environments, suggests that this is a general response of D. ebraccatus to egg predator attack. Both ant attack and sublethal desiccation are common in nature, thus the inhibition of <b>escape</b> <b>hatching</b> in this context likely impacts tadpole recruitment. More generally, we demonstrate that an adaptive plastic response to risk is contingent on additional environmental variables and suggest that many instances of plasticity may similarly be modified by environmental constraints.

500|$|In {{water tank}} testing, {{engineers}} subjected G-ALYU to repeated re-pressurisation and over-pressurisation, and on 24 June 1954, after 3,057 flight cycles (1,221 actual and 1,836 simulated), G-ALYU burst open. Hall, Geoffrey de Havilland and Bishop were immediately {{called to the}} scene, where the water tank was drained to reveal that the fuselage had ripped open at {{a corner of the}} forward left <b>escape</b> <b>hatch</b> cutout. A further test reproduced the same results. [...] Based on these findings, Comet 1 structural failures could be expected at anywhere from 1,000 to 9,000 cycles. Before the Elba accident, G-ALYP had made 1,290 pressurised flights, while G-ALYY had made 900 pressurised flights before crashing. Dr P.B. Walker, Head of the Structures Department at the RAE, said he was not surprised by this, noting that the difference was about three to one, and previous experience with metal fatigue suggested a total range of nine to one between experiment and outcome in the field could result in failure.|$|E
