5|$|Genes {{are made}} from DNA (<b>deoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acid)</b> and, in many viruses, RNA (ribonucleic acid). The {{biological}} information contained in an organism is encoded in its DNA or RNA. Most organisms use DNA, but many viruses have RNA as their genetic material. The DNA or RNA of viruses consists of either a single strand or a double helix.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of living organisms encode their genes in long strands of DNA (<b>deoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acid).</b> DNA consists of a chain made from four types of nucleotide subunits, each composed of: a five-carbon sugar (2'-deoxyribose), a phosphate group, {{and one of the}} four bases adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine.|$|E
5|$|Advances in {{understanding}} genes and inheritance continued throughout the 20th century. <b>Deoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> (DNA) {{was shown to}} be the molecular repository of genetic information by experiments in the 1940s to 1950s.

5|$|Herpes {{antiviral}} therapy {{began in}} the early 1960s with the experimental use of medications that interfered with viral replication called <b>deoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> (DNA) inhibitors. The original use was against normally fatal or debilitating illnesses such as adult encephalitis, keratitis, in immunocompromised (transplant) patients, or disseminated herpes zoster. The original compounds used were 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine, AKA idoxuridine, IUdR, or(IDU) and 1-β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine or ara-C, later marketed under the name cytosar or cytorabine. The usage expanded to include topical treatment of herpes simplex, zoster, and varicella. Some trials combined different antivirals with differing results. The introduction of 9-β-D-arabinofuranosyladenine, (ara-A or vidarabine), considerably less toxic than ara-C, in the mid-1970s, heralded the way for the beginning of regular neonatal antiviral treatment. Vidarabine was the first systemically administered antiviral medication with activity against HSV for which therapeutic efficacy outweighed toxicity for the management of life-threatening HSV disease. Intravenous vidarabine was licensed for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1977. Other experimental antivirals of that period included: heparin, trifluorothymidine (TFT), Ribivarin, interferon, Virazole, and 5-methoxymethyl-2'-deoxyuridine (MMUdR). The introduction of 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine, AKA acyclovir, in the late 1970s raised antiviral treatment another notch and led to vidarabine vs. acyclovir trials in the late 1980s. The lower toxicity and ease of administration over vidarabine has led to acyclovir becoming the drug of choice for herpes treatment after it was licensed by the FDA in 1998. Another advantage in the treatment of neonatal herpes included greater reductions in mortality and morbidity with increased dosages, which did not occur when compared with increased dosages of vidarabine. However, acyclovir seems to inhibit antibody response, and newborns on acyclovir antiviral treatment experienced a slower rise in antibody titer than those on vidarabine.|$|E
25|$|Living organisms {{synthesize}} proteins, {{which are}} polymers of amino acids using instructions encoded by <b>deoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> (DNA). Protein synthesis entails intermediary ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymers. One possibility for how life began is that genes originated first, followed by proteins; the alternative being that proteins came {{first and then}} genes.|$|E
25|$|Two {{different}} kinds of genetic material exist: <b>deoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). Cells use DNA for their long-term information storage. The biological information contained in an organism is encoded in its DNA sequence. RNA is used for information transport (e.g., mRNA) and enzymatic functions (e.g., ribosomal RNA). Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules are used to add amino acids during protein translation.|$|E

Plasmid <b>deoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acids</b> taken from translucent strain cells and from cells of certain opaque variants were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Two plasmids of molecular weights of approximately 2 x 10 (6) and 50 x 10 (6), respectively, {{were found in the}} wild-type translucent cells; one of them, the 2 x 10 (6) -molecular-weight plasmid, was always missing from <b>deoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acids</b> of the opaque variant cells.

25|$|Coltivirus is a genus of viruses. Viruses are {{intracellular}} parasites that do {{not have}} the necessary means to reproduce on their own, so they have to hijack the machinery of a host cell instead. Only then can they synthesize their viral proteins and make progeny. There are two types of viruses, distinguished by their type of genetic material. DNA viruses have genomes consisting of <b>deoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> (or DNA), while RNA viruses, like Coltivirus, have an RNA (ribonucleic acid) genome.|$|E
25|$|The AAV genome {{is built}} of {{single-stranded}} <b>deoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> (ssDNA), either positive- or negative-sensed, {{which is about}} 4.7 kilobase long.

25|$|Compounds {{that make}} up organisms may be divided into {{macromolecule}}s and other, smaller molecules. The four groups of macromolecule are nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids. Nucleic acids (specifically <b>deoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acid,</b> or DNA) store genetic data as a sequence of nucleotides. The particular sequence of the four different types of nucleotides (adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine) dictate many characteristics that constitute the organism. The sequence is divided up into codons, {{each of which is}} a particular sequence of three nucleotides and corresponds to a particular amino acid. Thus a sequence of DNA codes for a particular protein that, due to the chemical properties of the amino acids it is made from, folds in a particular manner and so performs a particular function.|$|E
25|$|<b>Deoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> is a {{molecule}} that carries {{most of the}} genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins and complex carbohydrates, {{they are one of}} the three major types of macromolecule that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. The two DNA strands are known as polynucleotides since they are composed of simpler units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of a nitrogen-containing nucleobase—either cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A), or thymine (T)—as well as a sugar called deoxyribose and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. According to base pairing rules (A with T, and C with G), hydrogen bonds bind the nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands to make double-stranded DNA. The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 1037, and weighs 50 billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as 4 TtC (trillion tons of carbon).|$|E
25|$|Pauling then {{proposed}} that <b>deoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> (DNA) was a triple helix; his model contained several basic mistakes, including a proposal of neutral phosphate groups, {{an idea that}} conflicted with the acidity of DNA. Sir Lawrence Bragg had been disappointed that Pauling had won the race to find the alpha helix structure of proteins. Bragg's team had made a fundamental error in making their models of protein by not recognizing the planar nature of the peptide bond. When it was learned at the Cavendish Laboratory that Pauling was working on molecular models {{of the structure of}} DNA, James Watson and Francis Crick were allowed to make a molecular model of DNA. They later benefited from unpublished data from Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin at King's College which showed evidence for a helix and planar base stacking along the helix axis. Early in 1953 Watson and Crick proposed a correct structure for the DNA double helix. Pauling later cited several reasons to explain how he had been misled about the structure of DNA, among them misleading density data and the lack of high quality X-ray diffraction photographs. During the time Pauling was researching the problem, Rosalind Franklin in England was creating the world's best images. They were key to Watson's and Crick's success. Pauling did not see them before devising his mistaken DNA structure, although his assistant Robert Corey did see at least some of them, while taking Pauling's place at a summer 1952 protein conference in England. Pauling had been prevented from attending because his passport was withheld by the State Department on suspicion that he had Communist sympathies. This led to the legend that Pauling missed the structure of DNA because of the politics of the day (this was {{at the start of the}} McCarthy period in the United States). Politics did not play a critical role. Not only did Corey see the images at the time, but Pauling himself regained his passport within a few weeks and toured English laboratories well before writing his DNA paper. He had ample opportunity to visit Franklin's lab and see her work, but chose not to.|$|E

500|$|Philosophy {{of biology}} deals with epistemological, metaphysical, and ethical {{issues in the}} {{biological}} and biomedical sciences. Although philosophers of science and philosophers generally have long been interested in biology (e.g., Aristotle, Descartes, Leibniz and even Kant), philosophy of biology only emerged as an independent field of philosophy in the 1960s and 1970s. Philosophers of science began to pay increasing attention to developments in biology, from {{the rise of the}} modern synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s to the discovery of the structure of <b>deoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> (DNA) in 1953 to more recent advances in genetic engineering.
