5|$|The {{majority}} of the European population before industrialization lived in rural communities or isolated farms and households. The norm was self-sufficiency with {{only a small percentage}} of production being exported or sold in markets. Large towns were exceptions and required their surrounding hinterlands to support them with food and fuel. The dense urban population could support a wide variety of food establishments that catered to various social groups. Many of the poor city dwellers had to live in cramped conditions without access to a <b>kitchen</b> <b>or</b> even a hearth, and many did not own the equipment for basic cooking. Food from vendors was in such cases the only option. Cookshops could either sell ready-made hot food, an early form of fast food, or offer cooking services while the customers supplied some or all of the ingredients. Travellers, such as pilgrims en route to a holy site, made use of professional cooks to avoid having to carry their provisions with them. For the more affluent, there were many types of specialist that could supply various foods and condiments: cheesemongers, pie bakers, saucers, waferers, etc. Well-off citizens who had the means to cook at home could on special occasions hire professionals when their own <b>kitchen</b> <b>or</b> staff could not handle the burden of throwing a major banquet.|$|E

The terminology for {{these in the}} 16th century was still not standardised so the terms used here are those that were applied by the Mary Rose Trust. The hold lay furthest down in the ship, right above the bottom planking below the waterline. This is where the <b>kitchen,</b> <b>or</b> galley, was situated and the food was cooked. Directly aft of the galley was the mast step, a rebate in the centre-most timber of the keelson, right above the keel, which supported the main mast, and next to it the main bilge pump. To increase {{the stability of the}} ship, the hold was where the ballast was placed and much of the supplies were kept. Right above the hold was the orlop, the lowest deck. Like the hold it was partitioned and was also used as a storage area for everything from food to spare sails.|$|E

25|$|The medieval smoke <b>kitchen</b> (<b>or</b> Farmhouse kitchen) {{remained}} common, {{especially in}} rural farmhouses and generally in poorer homes, until much later. In a few European farmhouses, the smoke kitchen was in regular use {{until the middle}} of the 20th century. These houses often had no chimney, but only a smoke hood above the fireplace, made of wood and covered with clay, used to smoke meat. The smoke rose more or less freely, warming the upstairs rooms and protecting the woodwork from vermin.|$|E
25|$|In Spanish art, a bodegón is a still-life {{painting}} depicting pantry items, such as victuals, game, and drink, often {{arranged on}} a simple stone slab, and also a painting {{with one or more}} figures, but significant still-life elements, typically set in a <b>kitchen</b> <b>or</b> tavern. Starting in the Baroque period, such paintings became popular in Spain {{in the second quarter of}} the 17th century. The tradition of still-life painting appears to have started and was far more popular in the contemporary Low Countries, today Belgium and Netherlands (then Flemish and Dutch artists), than it ever was in southern Europe. Northern still lifes had many subgenres; the breakfast piece was augmented by the trompe-l'œil, the flower bouquet, and the vanitas. In Spain there were much fewer patrons for this sort of thing, but a type of breakfast piece did become popular, featuring a few objects of food and tableware laid on a table. Still-life painting in Spain, also called bodegones, was austere. It differed from Dutch still life, which often contained rich banquets surrounded by ornate and luxurious items of fabric or glass. The game in Spanish paintings is often plain dead animals still waiting to be skinned. The fruits and vegetables are uncooked. The backgrounds are bleak or plain wood geometric blocks, often creating a surrealist air. Even while both Dutch and Spanish still life often had an embedded moral purpose, the austerity, which some find akin to the bleakness of some of the Spanish plateaus, appears to reject the sensual pleasures, plenitude, and luxury of Dutch still-life paintings.|$|E

25|$|He {{was born}} in Mechelen (at that time part of the Burgundian Netherlands) into {{extremely}} humble circumstances, {{the son of a}} poor cobbler. He received his early education there but quickly transferred to Gouda, where the Brothers of the Common Life ran a famous school along monastic lines. Here Jan developed his preference for a mystical, as opposed to an intellectual, approach to religion, together with a determinedly ascetic approach to religious life. The education he received from the Brothers was a traditional Medieval one, including Grammar and Logic, conducted during long days, interrupted by religious devotions, and accompanied by frugal meals, cold beds and many punishments. However, the ancient writers were not neglected—Virgil, Ovid, Horace, Cicero and Cato were much studied with a view to producing a good Latin style and many moral messages. But he was warned against the views of these pagan authors, to counterbalance which he studied the Bible and the Church Fathers. In particular, he studied the Devotio Moderna; a mystical approach based on Thomas a Kempis's Imitation of Christ—in particular, imitation of his sufferings. Jan paid for his studies, as many poor boys did, by serving in the <b>kitchen,</b> <b>or</b> attending to richer students, and performing menial tasks, such as ringing the bell. According to the anonymous monk who was his first biographer (1519), he could not afford candles, so he read, after a hard day, high up in the bell tower {{by the light of the}} moon. He never managed to develop a good Latin style—it was apparently always rough and full of mistakes—and he knew nothing of the Greek that was kindling the enthusiasm of so many of his contemporaries, but he never lost his love of the severe religious life learned at Gouda.|$|E

500|$|The auditionees {{were told}} that the show was being created by the {{production}} company Nikita Russian Productions (NRP). For the purposes of the auditions, Russian enlisted the help of his friends to take on roles such as psychoanalysts and runners—his girlfriend, whom he had met on a university access course, acted as a psychological assessor, while his friend Mike was a cameraman. The auditionees were then divided into small groups and given practical and psychological tests to complete, such as baking a cake in under an hour without a <b>kitchen</b> <b>or</b> ingredients. From these auditionees, 30 people were selected to star in Russian's programme, which he had dubbed [...] "Project MS-2".|$|E
500|$|On {{including}} the Punisher {{specifically in the}} season, where he is introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Goddard felt television was the best fit for the character, as the writers are [...] "able to do things {{on the small screen}} that fit that character better than if we had to water him down for the movies." [...] Goddard stated that the season's approach to the characters and their actions would be to do what makes sense for the characters rather than [...] "pushing the boundary" [...] or looking to shock the audience, though he noted that this could still go in a more [...] "adult...darker, dirtier" [...] way due to the freedom of Netflix and the presence of characters such as the Punisher. Petrie stated that the writers hoped to [...] "stir the pot" [...] and [...] "get people to think" [...] with the inclusion of the Punisher and his lethal methods, adding, [...] "Taking lethal justice into your own hands in America in 2015 is tricky shit. We have not shied away from the rich complicated reality of Now. If you've got a gun and you're not the police you're going to incite strong feelings." [...] Ramirez added that Castle was not referred to as [...] "Punisher" [...] in the writer's room, similarly to Wilson Fisk not being called [...] "Kingpin" [...] for season one, as it allowed the writers to think [...] "about [...] as a man with a vendetta, who made an oath to his dead family. The more specific it got, the less it became about issues outside of Hell’s <b>Kitchen</b> <b>or</b> other things." [...] In the series, the moniker of [...] "The Punisher" [...] is given to Castle by the media due to his aggressive actions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{destruction}} frequently included ransacking the priest's house, {{and sometimes}} private houses suspected of sheltering church goods.

2500|$|In {{order to}} donate money one {{must have a}} wealth base. In Hungerford's case that wealth {{primarily}} derived from banking as noted above. This self-made man {{was not one to}} waste funds. According to the 1865 New York Census, he had a boarder, William Haggerty stay in his house, which offset the cost of the household servant, Ellen McCarty. Furthermore, the census showed that he owned a 450-acre farm, valued at $7,000.00, yielding, meat, apples, wheat, butter, milk, and other foodstuffs that ended up in the Hungerford <b>kitchen</b> <b>or</b> at market. [...] Another way he saved money was not having children to support. As a result, he was able to accumulate a lot of wealth to be used for philanthropic purposes.|$|E
2500|$|The block <b>kitchen</b> (<b>or</b> island) is a {{more recent}} development, {{typically}} found in open kitchens. Here, the stove or both the stove and the sink are placed where an L or U kitchen would have a table, in a free-standing [...] "island", separated from the other cabinets. In a closed room, this does not make much sense, but in an open kitchen, it makes the stove accessible from all sides such that two persons can cook together, and allows for contact with guests or {{the rest of the}} family, since the cook does not face the wall any more. Additionally, the kitchen island's counter-top can function as an overflow-surface for serving buffet style meals or sitting down to eat breakfast and snacks.|$|E
2500|$|The castle's {{outbuildings}} {{consist of}} a big water cistern and a stable, {{which would have been}} rendered useless {{in the event of a}} siege. The castle's gates were located inside a two storey rectangular tower, which encompassed a Frankish style pointed arch. To the west of the tower there are three barrel vaulted buildings and recess all Frankish in origin. The buildings immediately behind the gate are three irregularly shaped chambers, the fourth building's ruins can be found nearby. The castle's main stairway then branches to the west leading to a two storey, unvaulted Byzantine building, which is divided into three large chambers. The castle's upper ward included a rectangular Byzantine cistern, interconnected with 4 rectangular wards containing pipes for collecting water. On upper ward's eastern side was guarded by a short, Frankish, groin vaulted tower. On its sides was the eastern cistern and a building that may have served as a church. At the extreme west of the castle stands a ruined, isolated tower. The lack of a <b>kitchen</b> <b>or</b> a food storage, points to the fact that rooms were multi functional in their nature.|$|E
50|$|In the U.S., garage apartments are {{frequently}} found in older urban areas, either in secondary buildings designed {{for such purposes}} (sometimes called 'guest' or 'carriage' houses), or converted into residential units from their original use. ADUs may be regulated by size, occupancy, lot size, core features (such as <b>kitchens</b> <b>or</b> bathrooms), other building codes and parking allotment. In Canada, {{they can also be}} referred to as coachhouses and in Australia, Fonzie flats.|$|R
50|$|A <b>kitchen</b> maid <b>or</b> <b>kitchen</b> girl {{is a young}} housemaid, {{or other}} junior female {{domestic}} worker. In the hierarchy of a great house she ranked below a cook and above a scullery maid.

25|$|Garderobes were toilets {{used in the}} Post-classical history, most {{commonly}} found in upper-class dwellings. Essentially, they were flat pieces of wood or stone spanning from one wall to the other, {{with one or more}} holes to sit on. These were above chutes or pipes that discharged outside the castle or Manor house. Garderobes would be placed in areas away from bedrooms to shun the smell and also near <b>kitchens</b> <b>or</b> fireplaces to keep the enclosure warm.|$|R
