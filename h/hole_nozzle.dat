40|$|The {{process of}} the {{conventional}} diesel combustion in small-size passenger car engines is an object of research. The combustion process can be divided in the sub-processes injection, mixture formation, auto-ignition and combustion. In the present work different laser-optical measurement technologies were used to receive information about the combustion in a passenger car diesel engine. The investigations were carried out in a cylinder of a passenger car diesel engine, modified for the optical access. Diesel as the fuel was used. The combustion of the pre-injection spray, which serves mainly for the reduction of combustion noise, was qualitatively visualized for an 8 <b>hole</b> <b>nozzle.</b> Obviously, during pre-injection combustion soot is formed. Some of this soot remains up {{to the beginning of}} the main injection event. This is confirmed by flame luminescence imaging of the auto-ignition of the main injection with the standard 6 <b>hole</b> <b>nozzle.</b> Soot formation and soot oxidation of the main injection were examined in detail under different conditions by Laser-Induced Incandescence (LII) as well as the Laser Extinction Method (LEM). Employing both measurement techniques the temporal development of the local soot distribution and the average soot volume fraction were determined till the late mixture-controlled combustion phase. In general, a lower injection pressure and the use of the 8 <b>hole</b> <b>nozzle</b> showed significant differences in the soot distribution in comparison to the reference operating point. The influence of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) on the soot oxidation was examined by a single-cycle analysis. This revealed that by application of EGR a raised number of soot pockets appears without soot luminescence. With EGR combustion reactions cease more often in the presence of soot. Therefore, soot is only slowly further oxidised in these regions. At the end of the late mixture-controlled combustion phase the Spontaneous Raman Scattering (SRS) could be applied successfully for determination of temperature and mole fraction distribution of oxygen and carbon dioxide above the piston bowl. From the results it can be reasoned, that soot emissions must predominantly result from the slowing down of the oxidation reactions at low temperatures. Local oxygen concentrations are high, and hence should not be the primary cause of soot oxidation limitation. Soot deposition on the bowl surface was estimated by determination of the transmission reduction of the glass piston bowl based on LII signal. It was shown by a comparison with exhaust soot emissions of different operating conditions that soot on the piston bowl does not contribute directly to the exhaust soot emissions...|$|E

Spray behavior is quantified by SMD measurements using Malvern Spraytec system and cone angle, penetration length through use of a high speed camera imagery. MEMS-LIGA based method was chosen as the method of fabrication for its ability to fabricate diameters below the EDM capability. The advantage of the LIGA method is quality of the nozzle cross-section and the ability to maintain very close tolerances in diameter and nozzle-to-nozzle distance. A total of 17 planar (2 D) and 8 curved (3 D) nozzles were tested at different injection pressures (up to 400 bar). The current work uses a HEUI system and documents the effects of Injection (Rail) Pressure, number of micro-nozzles and nozzles ’ placement.

Therefore supply of water {{has become one of}} the {{fundamental}} requirements of any society and the need to transfer water has generated the design of various forms of mechanical devices, which can be categorized as pumps. Jet pump is a device that performs its pumping action by the transfer of energy from a high velocity supply jet to one of low velocity suction flow. These two flows mix in the mixing tube and the kinetic energy of the combined flow is converted partially into the pressure energy in the diffuser. The optimization of the design of multi <b>hole</b> <b>nozzle</b> jet pump with various pitch circle diameter (PCD) and five different diameter mixing tubes. The area ratios chosen have been modified and the final area ratios used were R = 0. 20, 0. 28, 0. 36, 0. 43 & 0. 50. From the graphs, head ratio at zero discharge ratios (No), discharge ratio at zero head ratio (Mo) and slope of M-N (m) curve were noted along with the extrapolated values of maximum efficiency (�bep), optimum discharge ratio (Mopt), and optimum head ratio (Nopt) and tabulated. In order to distinguish these nozzle plates from these charts one can conclude that efficiency is higher at lower pitch circle diameter, lower mixing tube diameter and higher area ratios. In the range of experiments conducted highest maximum efficiency was obtained for an area ratio of 0. 43 with 2 holes on 13 PCD with 25. 9 mm mixing tube...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the boundary layer and the emission spectrum from an accretion disk having a jet anchored at its inner radius, {{close to the}} black hole. We summarise our earlier work {{and apply it to}} the accretion disks of some blazars. We suggest that the 'accretion disk with jet' (ADJ) model could make the bridge between standard accretion disk models (suitable for quasars and FRII sources) and low-power advection dominated accretion disk models (suitable for some of the low- power BL Lacs and FRI sources). The jet is collimated within a very narrow region close to the black <b>hole</b> (<b>nozzle).</b> In our model it is assumed that the boundary layer of the disk is the region between radius R-ms - the last marginally stable circular orbit calculated for a Kerr geometry-and the radius R- jet, which gives the thickness of the 'footring', i. e. the base of the jet. We analyse the size of the boundary layer of the disk where the jet is fed with energy, mass, and angular momentum. As a consequence of the angular momentum extraction, the accretion disk beyond R-jet no longer has a Keplerian flow. A hot corona usually surrounds the disk, and entrainment of the corona along the flow could also be important for the energy and mass budget of the jet. We assume that the gravitational energy available at the footring of the jet goes into the jet, and so the spectrum from the accretion disk gives a total luminosity smaller than that of a 'standard' accretion disk, and our ADJ model should apply for blazars with low central luminosities. Variations of the boundary layer and nozzle may account for some of the variability observed in active galactic nuclei...|$|E
40|$|The fuels from {{renewable}} resources have obtained an increasing interest for transport application {{in the last}} decade because of their biodegradability, potential improvements on exhaust emissions and benefits on the virtuous CO 2 cycle of the earth. The different physic-chemical characteristics of the biofuel, respect to diesel fuel, affect the combustion phenomenon in diesel engines being different the droplets distribution in the combustion chamber and, consequently, the air-fuel mixture preparation in the ignition delay ready to be burned. The recent trend to enhance the spray atomisation, increasing the injection pressure and the hole number in the nozzle to better distribute the fuel, imposes a deep understatement of the spray characteristics in terms of tip penetration, cone-angle, droplet velocity, fragmentation and vaporization. The modern Common Rail (CR) injection apparatus enable a management of injection strategy both in terms of injection pressure and injection number and timing per cycle. They allow to exploit all the potentiality of modulated combustion in engine for NOx and noise reduction, acting on pilot and pre-injections, and matter particulate using post and late injections. In this paper a study of overall behaviour of spray from rapeseed methylester (RME) biofuel and diesel fuel has been carried out in an optically accessible vessel filled with inert gas (N 2) with pressure ranging between 0. 1 to 5. 0 MPa. The injections were obtained by a CR apparatus driven by a Programmable Electronic Control Unit (PECU) enabling different strategies performances. The injector mounted an axially disposed cylindrical single <b>hole</b> <b>nozzle</b> (0. 18 mm in diameter and 1. 0 mm in thickness) and the investigated injection pressures have been 60, 90 and 120 MPa. The sprays have been lightened by a pulsed sheet (100 μm in thickness and 10 ns in duration) generated by the second harmonic of a Nd-YAG laser and matched at different instant from the start of injection. The jet images have been captured by a CCD camera collecting the light scattered at right angle and synchronized with the light sheet. A digital pulser/delayer has allowed finely investigating the entire spray duration (1. 0 ms). The spray characteristics have been extracted by a digital image processing software. Tip penetration and spray cone-angle have been strictly measured while droplet velocities and nozzle discharge coefficient have been derived from the data. The diverse characteristics of the investigated fuels have produced quite differences in sprays global performances in terms of penetrations and cone-angles. These differences have shown a no-monotonic behaviour during the spray duration and their relationships with the injection pressure have been observed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} work, {{the effect of}} dry air cooling (DAC), flood cooling (FC) and cooling with minimum {{quantity}} cutting fluid (MQCF) on average surface roughness (Ra), chip thickness and tool flank wear were studied. For MQCF, a specially designed and fabricated mist application system was developed. In MQCF, the cutting fluid and pressurized air are mixed externally to form homogenous mist at the exit of twin <b>holed</b> <b>nozzle,</b> which is delivered to cutting zone. Preliminary experiments were carried out to find the optimum air pressure (cutting fluid discharge) for minimum Ra and tool wear. Later complete experiments were planned according to central rotatable composite design technique. It was found from the experimental results that MQCF was effective in substantially bringing down the Ra (22 % & 15. 5 %), chip thickness (9. 5 % & 5. 0 %), and flank wear (15. 5 % & 6. 0 %), compared to DAC and FC respectively. In MQCF, due to negligible consumption of cutting fluid, both emissions during machining and cutting fluid cost are negligible. Hence the product cost is reduced greatly in MQCF. Thus MQCF enhances safety standards, environmental cleanliness and reduces the manufacturing cost of the produc...|$|R
40|$|The burner {{system is}} a patented, unique, higher-efficiency and fuel-injector system that works with a {{specially}} designed oil burner to create ultra-efficient combustion that reduces oil use, greenhouse gases and other harmful emissions. This research shows the injector nozzle geometries {{play a significant role}} in flow characteristics, atomization and formation of fuel-air mixture in order to improve combustion performance, and reducesome pollutant products from burner system. The aim of this research is to determine the effects of <b>nozzle</b> <b>hole</b> shape on flowcharacteristics of the premix injector by using CFD. Multiphase of volume of fluid (VOF) cavitating flow inside nozzles are determined by means of steady simulations and Eulerian-Eulerian two-fluid approach is used for performing mixing of Jatropha oil and air. Nozzle flow simulations resulted that cavitation area is strongly dependent on the <b>nozzle</b> <b>hole</b> shape. Conical hole with k-factor of 2 provides higher flow velocity and turbulent kinetic energy compared with conical hole with k-factor of 1. 3 and cylindrical hole. The results show that the premix injector <b>nozzle</b> <b>hole</b> shape gives impact to the flowcharacteristics and indirectly affects the emission of the burner syste...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} in the paper that high {{concentrations}} of narrow band particle size distributions with a mean diameter below one micrometer can be easily generated by means of multi <b>hole</b> <b>nozzles</b> under over-critical pressure conditions (> 1 bar) provided the kinetic energy, entering the liquid volume, is above a certain value. This experimental result can be explained by assuming that the nozzle has basically three functions. Firstly, it generates the particles at the nozzle exit. Secondly, it changes the fluid mechanical state of the fluid into a two phase liquid which seems to promote the generation of smaller particle size distributions as the fluid mechanical parameters are different. Thirdly, the remaining kinetic energy which is not consumed for the generation of the particles or the transition of the fluid mechanical state is transfered into the turbulent motion of the liquid and may act as an active impactor as the shearing of the bubbles which carry the particles to the liquid surface is enhanced. Beside this result it could be qualitative shown that bubbles arise from the liquid fed holes of the Laskin nozzle. This implies that no particles can be generated at the ring side of the jet, in contrast to the existing literature...|$|R
