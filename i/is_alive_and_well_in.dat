25|$|Plants are {{referred}} to as annuals which live only one year, biennials which live two years, and perennials which live longer than that. The longest-lived perennials, woody-stemmed plants such as trees and bushes, often live for hundreds and even thousands of years (one may question whether or not they may die of old age). A giant sequoia, General Sherman <b>is</b> <b>alive</b> <b>and</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> its third millennium. A Great Basin Bristlecone Pine called Methuselah is 4,848 years old (as of 2017) and the Bristlecone Pine called Prometheus was a little older still, at least 4,844 years (and possibly as old as 5,000 years), when it was cut down in 1964. The oldest known plant (possibly oldest living thing) is a clonal Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides) tree colony in the Fishlake National Forest in Utah called Pando at about 80,000 years. Lichen, a symbiotic algae and fungal proto-plant, such as Rhizocarpon geographicum can live upwards of 10,000 years.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of November, Benfica headed to the Azores to play Santa Clara. They won 2–1 due to a double from Simão. A week later, the team played Paços de Ferreira in the Estádio da Luz. The game ended with a 7–0 win for Benfica; Antonio Tadeia writing for Record said the win [...] "showed that Benfica it <b>is</b> <b>alive</b> <b>and</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> the league, even without two internationals, Simão and Petit". On 16 November, Benfica played Varzim away, resulting in a 1–2 loss; Rui Dias wrote for Record that, Varzim [...] "adjusted better to the windstorm night and to the soaking wet field...taking the initiative {{in the search for}} the three points".|$|E

2500|$|Science {{fiction writer}} Theodore Sturgeon's 1954 short story [...] "To Here and the Easel" [...] is an {{assembly}} of {{portions of the}} Orlando story intermixed with a current-day recasting of the story {{into the lives of}} a painter suffering from artist's block (Ruggiero/Rogero and his analog Giles), a mysterious faithful supporter (Bradamante and her analog Miss Brandt) and her jaded, fabulously wealthy employer (Angelica appearing as an echo more than an analog) and Giles' redemption (breaking his blockage) at the hands of Miss Brandt. The story first appeared in 1954 in a Ballantine collection with limited success, but was republished as the first story in the collection Sturgeon <b>Is</b> <b>Alive</b> <b>And</b> <b>Well...</b> <b>in</b> 1971.|$|E
2500|$|Songs About Fucking was {{released}} {{shortly after the}} band's breakup {{and went on to}} become their most successful record, with an initial pressing of eight thousand copies. Mark Deming of Allmusic calls it [...] "a scabrous masterpiece", while his colleague Andy Kellman states that [...] "each [...] is incisive enough to render a razor as effective as a butter knife. In sum: yowl, ching, thump-thump-screech. Ugly characters line up in the songs like early arrivals at a monster truck rally." [...] Critic Robert Christgau commented that [...] "Anybody who thinks rock and roll <b>is</b> <b>alive</b> <b>and</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> the infinite variety of its garage-boy permutations had better figure out how these Hitler Youth rejects could crush the competition and quit simultaneously. No matter what well-meaning rockers think of Steve Albini's supremacist lies, they lie themselves if they dismiss what he does with electric guitars—that Killdozer sound culminates if not finishes off whole generations of punk and metal." [...] Albini himself later considered the album's first side as Big Black's best output.|$|E

2500|$|Scholars have {{extensively}} {{criticized the}} decision. [...] According to Professor Bethany Berger, [...] "By patching together {{bits and pieces}} of history and isolated quotes from nineteenth century cases, and relegating contrary evidence to footnotes or ignoring it altogether, the majority created a legal basis for denying jurisdiction out of whole cloth." [...] Rather than legal precedent, the holding was [...] "dictated by the Court's assumptions that tribal courts could not fairly exercise jurisdiction over outsiders and that the effort to exercise such jurisdiction was a modern upstart of little importance to tribal concerns. [...] Professor Philip Frickey describes Oliphant, along with the subsequent decisions limiting tribal jurisdiction over non-Indians, as rooted in a “normatively unattractive judicial colonial impulse,” while Professor Robert Williams condemns the decision as [...] "legal auto-genocide" [...] According to Dr. Bruce Duthu, the case showed [...] "that the project of imperialism <b>is</b> <b>alive</b> <b>and</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> Indian Country and that courts can now get into the action." [...] Professor Duthu continues"The Oliphant Court essentially elevated a local level conflict between a private citizen and an Indian tribe into a collision of framework interests between two sovereigns, and in the process revived the most negative and destructive aspects of colonialism as it relates to Indian rights. This is a principal reason the decision has attracted so much negative reaction...Oliphant's impact on the development of federal Indian law and life on the ground in Indian Country has been nothing short of revolutionary. The opinion gutted the notion of full territorial sovereignty as it applies to Indian tribes." ...|$|E
