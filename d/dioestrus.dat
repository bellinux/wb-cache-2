40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the physiological {{activity of the}} myometrium in oestrus and <b>dioestrus</b> and the induced activity after medication in cows with particular reference to segmental differences. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Six cows were given the pharmaceuticals carbetocin, oxytocin and prostaglandin (PG) F 2 α (dinoprost) intramuscularly and PGE 2 intravenously. The physiological myometrial activity was recorded for 15 minutes and the induced activity for 105 minutes by using a transcervically attached pressure probe containing six pressure microtransducers. RESULTS: Lower pressures were measured in <b>dioestrus</b> compared to oestrus before (<b>dioestrus</b> 3. 2 ± 8. 88 mmHg, oestrus 12. 4 ± 13. 23 mmHg, p < 0. 0001) and after the drug administration. Carbetocin provoked the longest lasting effect (60 minutes in <b>dioestrus,</b> 75 minutes in oestrus) followed by PGE 2 (45 minutes in <b>dioestrus,</b> 60 minutes in oestrus), PGF 2 α (30 minutes each) and oxytocin (15 minutes in oestrus only). In contrast to the other drugs carbetocin did not cause any pressure decrease beneath the base level after the primary pressure increase in <b>dioestrus.</b> In <b>dioestrus</b> the pressure before drug administration was significantly higher in the cervix (3. 6 ± 19. 40 mmHg) and the uterine body (7. 1 ± 36. 10 mmHg) than in the uterine horn (1. 1 ± 7. 21 mmHg). Conversely, in oestrus the pressure in the uterine horn (16. 6 ± 17. 73 mmHg) {{was significantly higher than}} in the uterine body (6. 2 ± 16. 59 mmHg) and the cervix (10. 4 ± 17. 91 mmHg). Drug administration in <b>dioestrus</b> caused a cornual pressure increase and the pressure in the uterine body decreased, whereas in oestrus the pressure increased in all uterine segments. The physiological frequency of the pressure waves in <b>dioestrus</b> was 5. 2 ± 3. 02 in 15 minutes compared to 7. 5 ± 2. 89 in 15 minutes in oestrus. No traceable changes of the contraction frequency were found after medication. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Carbetocin caused the most enduring increase in intrauterine pressure in <b>dioestrus</b> and oestrus and may therefore be indicated best for therapeutic use. The tested drugs had the same effects on the various uterine segments and no effect on the contraction frequency...|$|E
40|$|Copyright © 2002 Society for Reproduction and FertilityLeptin is {{secreted}} by adipocytes and exerts {{its effects}} by {{interacting with the}} long form of the leptin receptor, OB-RB. The leptin protein and leptin receptors have been localized in the ovary, and acute leptin treatment directly inhibits ovulation in the rat ovary. It was hypothesized that expression of the leptin receptor gene varies throughout the oestrous cycle to modulate {{the sensitivity of the}} ovary to leptin. In this study, expression of genes for the long and short isoforms of the leptin receptor in the adult ovary was investigated at different stages of the rat oestrous cycle. Vaginal cytology was used to determine the stage of the oestrous cycle. Ovaries were collected and RNA was extracted for real-time RT-PCR analysis of leptin receptor gene expression. OB-RB gene expression was low in pro-oestrus (3. 13 +/- 0. 18 fg RNA per microg total DNA) and <b>dioestrus</b> II (2. 52 +/- 0. 19 fg RNA per microg total DNA) of the oestrous cycle, whereas expression was high in oestrus (5. 9 +/- 0. 27 fg RNA per microg total DNA) and <b>dioestrus</b> I (4. 6 +/- 0. 24 fg RNA per microg total DNA) (P < 0. 001). Expression of the gene for the short form of the leptin receptor (OB-RA) was at a maximum in <b>dioestrus</b> I (65. 5 +/- 0. 8 fg RNA per ng total DNA), high in oestrus (39. 0 +/- 0. 8 fg RNA per ng total DNA) and low at pro-oestrus (5. 0 +/- 0. 2 fg RNA per ng total DNA) and <b>dioestrus</b> II (1. 1 +/- 0. 09 fg RNA per ng total DNA) (P < 0. 001). Plasma oestradiol concentrations (pg ml- 1) were highest at pro-oestrus (19. 38 +/- 1. 3), and similar at the remaining three stages studied (oestrus: 13. 7 +/- 1. 9; <b>dioestrus</b> I: 12. 4 +/- 1. 0; <b>dioestrus</b> II: 10. 3 +/- 0. 9) (P < 0. 05). Plasma progesterone concentrations (ng ml- 1) were higher in the luteal phases of the oestrous cycle (<b>dioestrus</b> I: 18. 6 +/- 2. 3; <b>dioestrus</b> II: 14. 7 +/- 2. 5) than during pro-oestrus (5. 12 +/- 0. 6) and oestrus (5. 9 +/- 0. 8) (P < 0. 05). Plasma leptin concentrations were detectable only in pro-oestrus (0. 35 +/- 0. 05 ng ml(- 1)) and were below the detection limit of the assay at other stages of the oestrous cycle. In summary, mRNA content for the long and short isoforms of the leptin receptor is lower in pro-oestrus and <b>dioestrus</b> II than in oestrus and <b>dioestrus</b> I of the rat oestrous cycle. The fluctuations in leptin receptor mRNA content may be a response to the concentrations of circulating steroid hormones and leptin. This research supports the initial hypothesis and shows that ovarian leptin receptor concentrations vary throughout the oestrous cycle in response to the changing environment of the ovary. P. S.

40|$|Summary. In cyclic hamsters, {{exogenous}} progesterone (100 =m) administered s. c. at 09 : 00 h {{on the day}} of <b>dioestrus</b> II reduced prostaglandin (PG) E and 6 -keto PGF- 1 =a but not PGF {{concentrations in}} preovulatory follicles measured at 09 : 00 h of pro-oestrus. The injection of 10 =m LH (NIADDK-oLH- 25) concurrently with 100 =m progesterone on <b>dioestrus</b> II prevented the decline in follicular PGE and 6 -keto PGF=req- la values. Administration of LH alone did not significantly alter follicular PG concen-trations. Inhibition of follicular PGE accumulation by progesterone was due to a decline in granulosa PGE concentration and not thecal PGE. Progesterone adminis-tration also reduced follicular oestradiol concentrations. Administration of oestradiol=req- 17 -cyclopentanepropionate (ECP) (10 =m) with progesterone did not prevent the decline in follicular PGE and 6 -keto PGF- 1 =a did increase follicular PGF concen-trations. However, ECP given alone on <b>dioestrus</b> II reduced follicular PGE and increased PGF concentrations in preovulatory follicles on pro-oestrus.

40|$|Changes in the uterus: plasma and oviduct: plasma {{concentration}} ratios for radioactive iodide after {{the administration of}} progesterone at the di-oestrous stage of the oestrous cycle have confirmed that significant oestrogen secretion begins {{on the afternoon of}} the day of <b>dioestrus</b> in a 4 -day cycle. Progesterone injected at <b>dioestrus</b> delays ovulation and the change to a facilitatory effect on luteinizing hormone (LH) release does not occur until early on the day of pro-oestrus, about 12 hr. after the estimated time at which oestrogen secretion begins. Pentobarbitone (Nembutal) injected at 13. 30 hr. on the day of pro=req- oestrus blocks ovulation, but does not do so when injected 3 hr. later. When injected at either 13. 30 or 16. 30 hr. in <b>dioestrus,</b> it delays ovulation and may prevent it completely in that cycle. The injection of Nembutal at <b>dioestrus</b> does not appear to prevent the release of gonadotrophin responsible for oestrogen secretion and the delay of ovulation may be due to interference with some of the normal effects of oestrogen secreted {{at this stage of the}} cycle on the hypothalamo-hypophysial system. The delay of ovulation is not prevented by the injection of oestrogen with Nembutal at <b>dioestrus</b> but is prevented by the subsequent injection of progesterone at pro-oestrus.

40|$|Cannabis and cannabinoids {{are known}} to affect female reproduction. However, {{the role of the}} endocannabinoid system in mouse uterine {{contractility}} in the <b>dioestrus</b> and oestrus phases has not been previously investigated. The present study aimed at filling this gap. Endocannabinoid (anandamide and 2 -arachidonoylglycerol) levels were measured in mouse uterus at <b>dioestrus</b> and oestrus phases by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and western blot were used to measured the expression of cannabinoid receptors and enzymes involved in the metabolism of endocannabinoids. Contractility was evaluated in vitro either on the spontaneous contractions or by stimulating the isolated uterus with exogenous spasmogens. The tissue concentrations of anandamide and 2 -AG were reduced in the oestrus phase, compared to <b>dioestrus.</b> Uteri obtained in the <b>dioestrus,</b> but not oestrus, phase showed spontaneous phasic prostaglandin-mediated contractions that were reduced by ACEA (CB 1 receptor agonist) and to a lower extent by JWH 133 (CB 2 receptor agonist). These inhibitory effects were counteracted by the corresponding selective antagonists. Neither ACEA nor JWH 133 did affect the contractions induced by exogenous PGE 2 in the uterus from the oestrus phase. The FAAH inhibitor JNJ 1661010 and, to a lower extent, the MAGL inhibitor JZL 184 also reduced spontaneous contractions. It is concluded that the endocannabinoid system undergoes to adaptive changes between the oestrus and <b>dioestrus</b> phases. CB 1 and, to a lower extent, CB 2 receptor activation results in selective inhibition of myometrial contractility, without un-specific relaxing effects on the smooth muscle.

We evaluated the activity of the neuroendocrine dopaminergic neurones during oestrus and <b>dioestrus,</b> as determined by dopaminergic activity in the median eminence and neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary, as well as Fos-related antigen expression in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) -immunoreactive (ir) neurones of the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and periventricular nucleus (Pe). During oestrus, the 4 -dihydroxyphenylacetic acid/dopamine ratio in the median eminence decreased at 16. 00 h, coinciding with the increase in plasma prolactin levels. Similarly, the expression of Fos-related antigen in TH-ir neurones of Pe and rostral-, dorsomedial- and caudal-ARC also decreased at 16. 00 h. On <b>dioestrus,</b> 4 -dihydroxyphenylacetic acid/dopamine ratio in the median eminence and Fos-related antigen expression in TH-ir neurones of Pe and rostral-ARC decreased at 18. 00 h, whereas prolactin levels were unaltered. No variation in dopaminergic activity was found in the neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary on either oestrus or <b>dioestrus.</b> The number of TH-ir neurones in the ARC and parameters of dopaminergic activity were found to be generally lower on oestrus compared to <b>dioestrus.</b> The transitory decrease in the activity of neuroendocrine dopaminergic neurones temporally associated with the prolactin surge {{on the afternoon of}} oestrus suggests a role for dopamine in the generation of the oestrous prolactin surge.

40|$|Summary. Corpora lutea (CL) were {{collected}} from mares during early (Day 4 =n-),mid-(Day 8 =n-),and late (Day 12 =n- 3) <b>dioestrus.</b> Dispersed cell suspensions were obtained by enzymic digestion of tissue. Two distinct luteal cell populations (large and small) were observed. The proportion of small luteal cells significantly increased as age of CL advanced. Cells (2 =x 06) from CL which were incubated for 24 h secreted prostaglandin (PG) F, PGE- 2 and 6 -keto-PGF- 1 =athe stable metabolite of prostacyclin). Higher concen-trations of all PGs were produced by cells from CL at early <b>dioestrus</b> than from those at mid- or late <b>dioestrus.</b> The ratio of PGF:PGE- 2 increased from 0 =. 3 in CL of early <b>dioestrus</b> to 1 =. 4 in CL of mid-dioestrus, whereas ratios of PGF: 6 -keto-PGF- 1 =a remained relatively constant (= =.). The ratio of PGE- 2 : 6 -keto-PGF- 1 =a CL decreased between early (3 =. 7) and mid-dioestrus (0 =. 3). Addition of LH, dbcAMP, or ionophore to cell cultures did not consistently affect secretion of progesterone or PGs by luteal cells.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to analyze oestrogen receptor-alpha (ER alpha), ER beta and progesterone receptor (PR) gene expression in the canine oocyte and cumulus cells throughout the oestrous cycle. Ovaries from 38 bitches were recovered after ovariohysterectomy and sliced. The phase of the oestrous cycle was determined by vaginal cytology, vaginoscopy and serum hormonal measurements. Oocytes were mechanically denuded by repeated pipetting. For each phase of the cycle, a sample was composed by a pool of 50 oocytes (sample number: prooestrus = 3, oestrus = 8, <b>dioestrus</b> = 5 and anoestrus = 5) or a pool of cumulus cells (prooestrus = 4, oestrus = 7, <b>dioestrus</b> = 4 and anoestrus = 6). Oocyte and cumulus cells` total RNA was isolated and reverse transcription was conducted to perform real-time PCR. Oestrogen receptor-alpha was expressed throughout the cycle in the oocyte (33. 33 %, 25. 0 %, 20. 0 % and 60. 0 % for prooestrus, oestrus, <b>dioestrus</b> and anoestrus, respectively) and cumulus cells (50. 0 %, 47. 14 %, 25. 0 % and 66. 67 % for prooestrus, oestrus, <b>dioestrus</b> and anoestrus, respectively). In the oocyte, the ER beta was also expressed in all phases of the cycle (33. 33 %, 50. 0 %, 20. 0 % and 60. 0 % for prooestrus, oestrus, <b>dioestrus</b> and anoestrus, respectively), whereas in cumulus cells, ER beta was only expressed during prooestrus (50 %) and oestrus (14. 29 %). Interestingly, while the oocyte PR was not detected in any phase of the cycle, this receptor was expressed during prooestrus (50 %), oestrus (42. 86 %) and anoestrus (16. 67 %) in cumulus cells. In conclusion, canine oocytes express ER alpha and ER beta throughout the oestrous cycle, however, {{there is a lack of}} PR expression in all these phases.

Vasopressin concentrations were also determined to allow calculation of the ratios of the two hormones. The results were compared with those from male rats. Plasma oxytocin concentrations were significantly higher in the evening than in the morning on the day of oestrus. Although the evening concentration achieved was similar on each day of the cycle, morn-ing plasma oxytocin concentrations showed a pro-gressive rise from oestrus to pro-oestrus so that no significant diurnal increases were observed on the other days of the cycle. Vasopressin {{concentrations in}} the plasma were also seen to increase over the days of oestrus, <b>dioestrus</b> day 1 and <b>dioestrus</b> day 2. On pro-oestrus the plasma concentrations of vasopressin remained unchanged. The ratio of oxytocin:vasopres-sin fell during the light hours of the cycle. The hypo-thalamic content of both hormones showed a rise during the hours of daylight parallel to that seen in the plasma, whereas the pituitary content fell over the same period. The diurnal pattern of hormone release observed in male rats was similar to that in females at oestrus. However, the plasma oxytocin concentrations were significantly higher in the male.

For the further understanding of the mechanism of pyometra, in relation to steroid hormones and their receptors in the bitch, the difference between the expression of the oestrogen receptor alpha (ERa) between normal and pyometra bitches during <b>dioestrus</b> was investigated. Uterine samples were collected during <b>dioestrus</b> from normal and pyometra bitches. Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate the expression of ERa in the different compartments of the uterus. The results showed that the levels of steroid hormones in the normal and the pyometra group were similar, while ERa staining scores were significantly lower in the epithelia of the pyometra group compared to the normal group. This suggested that the expression of ER in the epithelia was strongly downregulated in pyometra cases compared to normal uteri during <b>dioestrus.</b> The mechanism of this downregulation may be due to more prolonged levels of progesterone and/or the suppression of oestrogen, via ERa, in order to enhance uterine infection.

40|$|Summary. Changes in {{endogenous}} prolactin {{levels in}} rats {{with age and}} after ovariec-tomy varied according to the reproductive state, emphasizing the different mechanisms underlying infertility in rats in constant oestrus and prolonged <b>dioestrus.</b> A decline in reproductive efficiency, {{as measured by the}} number of young per litter, the number of litters in a given period of time, or the regularity of the oestrous cycles, occurs in female rats at about 9 - 12 months of age (Ingram, 1959; Adams, 1972). At this time a female may be in (1) constant oestrus with follicular development but no ovulation, (2) prolonged <b>dioestrus</b> with hyperluteinized ovaries, or (3) prolonged <b>dioestrus</b> with atrophie ovaries. The results of several studies suggest that changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis are responsible for the reproductive failure. Electrical stimulation of the preoptic area of the hypothalamus (Clemens, Amenomori, Jenkins & Meites, 1969) or injections of catecholamines (Quadri, Kledzik & Meites, 1973; Huang & Meites, 1975) can restore regular cycles in old rats which were previously in constant oestrus. The ovary is unlikely to be the primary site of dysfunction since transplantation of ovaries of senile rats to the kidney capsule of ovariectomized young rats resulted in resumption ofoestrous cycles (Peng & Huang, 1972).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} how uterine motility as measured by both electromyographic techniques (emg), and to a lesser extent by intra-uterine pressure changes (IUP), is influenced by steroid hormones, uterine stimulants and relaxants, infused intra-uterine fluids, natural breeding and the first 20 days of pregnancy. Two intact and two ovariectomised mares had uterine emg activity measured from 3 - 8 hours/day over a period of 1 - 5 months. Simultaneous IUP recordings, using an open tipped catheter, were periodically taken. One intact mare during anoestrus and both spayed mares were given exogenous courses of oestradiol and progesterone to simulate oestrous cycle activity. Oxytocin, cloprostenol, propantheline bromide and clenbuterol were administered to each mare during anoestrus, transition, oestrus, and <b>dioestrus,</b> where applicable. Quantities (60 - 1000 ml) of sterile double distilled water were infused intra-uterine into each mare at various cycle stages. One intact mare was bred on four occasions and followed through the first 20 days of her pregnancy. Mares in oestrus recorded synchronous short bursts (3 - 5 min) of high amplitude emg activity following a crescendo-decrescendo pattern. In <b>dioestrus</b> burst duration increased (15 - 25 min) and amplitude decreased with increasing plasma progesterone levels. Emg results during anoestrus and transition were intermediate. During early pregnancy emg characteristics varied depending on whether the conceptus was in the oviduct, migratory or fixed. It is proposed that in oestrus emg changes manifest as contractions, while in <b>dioestrus</b> as increased uterine tone. Oxytocin and cloprostenol caused uterine responses at all cycle stages with the most pronounced response during oestrus where drug administration was followed by prolonged emg activity (10 - 25 min) initially and then followed by short burst activity. The least response was seen during <b>dioestrus.</b> Propantheline bromide decreased emg activity especially in <b>dioestrus</b> and is an effective uterine relaxant; clenbuterol however caused minimal measurable change. Infused intra-uterine fluids resulted in a single spike pattern of emg activity which was generally asynchronous between electrode sites during the first infusion and depressed uterine activity following a subsequent second infusion. Natural service resulted in minimal emg changes similar to those seen after rectal palpation, ie a short term (5 - 10 min) burst of densely grouped action potentials. This response is so short it seems unlikely either endogenous oxytocin and/or prostaglandins would have any significant influence on sperm transport in the mare; it is suggested that the emg change seen at this time is more in the nature of a local response to vaginal stimulation by the penis of the stallion, and is similar to that seen during palpation per rectum. Electrode site emg variation was common, especially during <b>dioestrus</b> and early pregnancy. The emg activity recorded in early pregnancy is different to that found in the nonpregnant <b>dioestrus</b> mare and probably related to the position of the embryo; it is suggested that abnormal uterine motility could be a cause of early embryonic death in this species. During the oestrous cycle there was little correlation either statistically or visually between emg and IUP with or without drug treatment, but IUP increased with uterokinetic drugs and decreased with relaxants. IUP changes may not be a reliable method of measuring uterine activity in the mare. This is supported by the finding that there was no statistical difference in IUP parameters measured between cycle stages, whereas there were important emg variations. As the experimental mares experienced signs of intestinal discomfort after administration of the uterine stimulants, and propantheline bromide is a known intestinal relaxant, the author argues that IUP results recorded after drug treatment could be influenced by the effects of these substances on intestinal motility rather than solely the consequence of a direct uterine response...|$|E

40|$|Use of oral {{altrenogest}} as exogenous progesterone (P 4) in mares in {{an effort}} to maintain high-risk pregnancies is a widespread practice. Treatment is sometimes initiated as early as 2 days after ovulation. Timing when it can safely be stopped is frequently uncertain and therefore, supplementation is often continued until 100 - 120 days, when the placental secretion of progestagens has taken over. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine if altrenogest interfered with progesterone assay and if timing of altrenogest administration discontinuation could be based on the blood concentration of P 4. Data were obtained from 7 healthy standard breed mares in seasonal anoestrus and in <b>dioestrus.</b> Mares were considered anoestrus when no follicles larger than 15 mm in diameter or corpus luteum (CL) were found at 2 consequent ultrasound examinations 7 days apart. They were confirmed <b>dioestrus</b> based on an observed ovulation and the presence of a CL 2 days after. Mares were treated with 0. 044 mg/kg of altrenogest (Regumate®, Intervet, Boxmeer, Netherlands) orally once per day during 12 days beginning at any time for the anestrus group and at day 2 after ovulation for the <b>dioestrus</b> group. Blood was collected at day 0, 6, 12, 18 right before altrenogest administration and the serum was stored at - 20 °C until analysis. P 4 concentration was obtained by radioimmunoassay and altrenogest by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Differences in P 4 and in altrenogest concentrations between different sampling days were determined by Friedman non parametric test. Concentrations of altrenogest before treatment were almost not detectable (negative control). At day 6, they were significantly higher (p< 0. 05), and were back to basal, almost not detectable values at day 18, in both groups. P 4 concentration was basal with values < 0. 4 ng/ml all through the experiment in the anoestrus group. In the <b>dioestrus</b> group, P 4 concentration was variable from one mare to another, but it was significantly higher in mid-dioestrus (day 6) as compared to the time of the impending next oestrus (day 12). No cross-reaction between P 4 and altrenogest assays was observed as illustrated by the fact that concentration of P 4 during anoestrus remained basal with or without supplementation. Despite the treatment, the variation of P 4 over time was as expected in both groups. Altrenogest was no longer detectable 6 days after the last administration. Further studies with larger numbers and sampling in <b>dioestrus</b> to compare P 4 levels in treated and untreated mares to investigate the potential effect of altrenogest on endogenous P 4 production by the CL are needed. However, our experiment shows that P 4 levels assayed by RIA can be trusted to evaluate if the secondary CL’s have become functional and can thus maintain the pregnancy while oral altrenogest supplementation is discontinued.

40|$|Contents Tumour {{necrosis}} factor (TNF), a pleiotropic cytokine {{that regulates}} cell growth and differentiation {{as well as}} the synthesis of other cytokines, has been identified in the uterus of several species describing a cyclic pattern, eventually under ovarian steroid regulation. Information is yet limited on the presence of TNF protein in the canine endometrium during the oestrous cycle and early pregnancy. This study depicts the temporal immunolocalization of TNF in the bitch endometrium along the oestrous cycle and changes associated with the early steps of embryo invasion. TNF immunolabelling was found in both the stromal fibroblasts and epithelial components of the canine endometrium in all stages studied. Stromal immunostaining was more intense than that of the epithelia, in all the stages of the oestrous cycle. In addition, a tendency for a decrease in the surface epithelium intensity score was found in early <b>dioestrus.</b> A positive glandular content was only observed in anoestrus and proestrus stages. In early pregnancy (days 13 - 16), TNF immunolabelling was detected at the embryo-maternal surface, in the syncytium cords and the trophoblast, as well in the endometrial stroma and the basal endometrial glands, but not in the lacunar epithelium. The overall TNF immunoreactivity was higher in early pregnancy samples in comparison with those of the early <b>dioestrus</b> and <b>dioestrus</b> stages, suggesting it plays a role during implantation.

40|$|Intermedin (IMD) is a {{peptide hormone}} {{discovered}} in 2004 {{belonging to the}} calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide superfamily. It signals through a Gprotein coupled receptor by the coupling of a calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) {{and one of the}} receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) 1 - 3. Due to its similarity to adrenomedullin in structure and functions, IMD is also known as adrenomedullin 2 (ADM 2). Among members of the superfamily, IMD shares the highest degree of homology with ADM, which is a multifunctional vasodilator ubiquitously expressed in various tissues and organs and has been studied by our group for its reproductive functions. It is hypothesized that IMD may be present in the reproductive systems of the rat and exert some effects on reproductive functions. The objectives of this study were to investigate the expression of IMD and its receptor components in the male and female reproductive systems of the rat, the changes in expression across the oestrous cycle, and its effect on uterine contraction. The gene expression levels of Imd and its receptor components and peptide levels of IMD were measured by RT-PCR and enzyme immunoassay respectively. The effect of IMD on the uterine contraction was studied by the organ bath technique. Imd mRNA and IMD levels were detected in the testis, epididymis, ventral prostate, coagulating gland, and seminal vesicle of the male rat and the ovary, oviduct, and uterus of the female rat, suggesting possible roles for IMD in both the male and female reproductive systems. In the male, the Imd mRNA levels were the highest in the seminal vesicle but lowest in the testis and the epididymis and IMD peptide levels were the highest in the coagulating gland but lowest in the epididymis. In the female, the Imd mRNA and IMD peptide levels were the highest in the oviduct and the uterus respectively while both the Imd and IMD levels were the lowest in the ovary. Imd mRNA and IMD levels displayed cyclic changes in various female reproductive tissues across the oestrous cycle. In the ovary, positive immunostaining was detected in the follicles and corpora lutea with more staining in the latter. The Imd mRNA level was significantly higher at prooestrus than <b>dioestrus</b> while the IMD peptide level was significantly higher at metoestrus than <b>dioestrus.</b> In the oviduct, the Imd mRNA level was the lowest at <b>dioestrus</b> but the IMD peptide level was the highest at <b>dioestrus.</b> Positive immunostaining was observed in the ciliated epithelial cells. Uterine Imd mRNA level was the highest at prooestrus while the IMD level was the highest at <b>dioestrus.</b> IMD was found in the luminal and glandular epithelia. IMD significantly reduced the uterine contraction amplitude and frequency but not the basal tone. CGRP receptor antagonist hCGRP 8 - 37 and ADM receptor antagonist hADM 22 - 52 partially abolished the inhibitory effect of IMD on uterine contraction while the IMD specific receptor antagonist hIMD 17 - 47 completely blocked the actions. Enzyme inhibitors of NO (L-NAME) and PI 3 K (Wortmannin) pathways diminished the IMD-mediated effects on uterine contraction while cAMP/PKA blocker KT 5720 had no effect. published_or_final_versionPhysiologyMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|Unilateral {{ovariectomy}} {{results in}} compensatory follicular growth and {{doubling of the}} number of ovulations in the remaining ovary. It has been suggested that this is (at least partly) due to the increased availability of circulating gonadotrophins to the remaining ovary (McLaren, 1966). If this view is correct, it could be expected that in hypophysectomized rats treated with fixed regimens of pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin (PMS), follicular development in one ovary would be stimulated by removal of the other ovary. Wistar rats (180 - 200 g) which had had at least three consecutive 5 -day cycles were used. In a first experiment (Table 1) the effect of unilateral ovariectomy on follicular growth in rats with an intact hypophysis was determined. The animals were unilaterally ovariectomized during oestrus or 2 days later (<b>dioestrus</b> 2). They were killed 1, 2, 3 or 4 days thereafter. In these rats a significant increase of follicular growth in the remaining ovary was seen on the 2 nd postoperative day after removal of one ovary during oestrus and on the 1 st postoperative day after removal of one ovary during <b>dioestrus</b> 2.

40|$|Uterine defences against {{bacterial}} challenge {{are more}} efficient during oestrus than during <b>dioestrus.</b> The exact reasons and mechanisms {{responsible for this}} difference are, however, still incompletely understood. The leukocyte reaction {{is one of the}} defence mechanisms that has been cited as being able to respond better to a bacterial challenge during oestrus than during <b>dioestrus.</b> The aim {{of the present study was}} to test the hypothesis that the magnitude of endometrial leukocyte migration following the instillation of semen into the uterine lumen is greater during oestrus than during <b>dioestrus.</b> Eight Nooitgedacht mares of normal fertility, aged between 8 and 16 years (11. 5 ± 2. 7; mean ± SD), were used in the study. Each mare received a different treatment during each of four oestrous cycles, with a rest cycle after each treatment. Two treatments were performed during <b>dioestrus</b> and two during oestrus. One treatment for each stage of the cycle was a control treatment without challenge to the endometrium. At time zero of challenged cycles a single aliquot of 13 ml raw semen, frozen-thawed without addition of any cryoprotectant or extender, was instilled into the uterus. An endometrial biopsy was taken 6 and 48 h after time zero and a swab for cytology and culture (if cytology was positive) was collected 48 and 120 h after time zero. An image analyzer was used to record the total number of cells, round cells, neutrophils and eosinophils per unit surface area of epithelium, stratum compactum (SC) and stratum spongiosum (SS). The relative number of round cells, neutrophils and eosinophils were expressed as proportions of the number of each cell type to the total number of cells. The use of an image analyser made the collection of quantitative data from histologic sections possible. However, the operator still had to make some critical decisions, namely to choose the field of the section for analysis and to assign individual cells to a chosen category. The total numbers of cells in the epithelium and the SS were greater during <b>dioestrus</b> than during oestrus, while no such difference could be demonstrated for the SC. The stage of the oestrous cycle had no meaningful influence on any other (measured or calculated) variable. During challenged cycles, absolute and relative numbers of neutrophils were significantly greater in the epithelium, SC and SS than during control cycles. There was an interaction (not always reaching significance) between treatment and time with regard to the absolute and relative numbers of neutrophils in epithelium and SS and round cells in the epithelium. Numbers of neutrophils and round cells were significantly higher 6 h after treatment than 48 h after treatment in challenged cycles, but did not differ during control cycles. During challenged cycles, the stage of the oestrous cycle when treatment occurred had no effect on the duration of the induced endometritis, the occurrence of positive cytology or culture results, or the type of bacteria that were cultured. Regardless of the stage of their cycles when they were challenged, all mares rid themselves of the opportunistic pathogens placed into the uterine lumen within one oestrous cycle. The hypothesis was rejected and it is therefore concluded that the stage of the oestrous cycle did not influence the magnitude of the endometrial leukocyte response to a standardized challenge with semen in these reproductively sound mares. A similar study will be required to test whether this conclusion also holds true for mares that are susceptible to endometritis. Dissertation (MMedVet (Gyn)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.

40|$|Endogenous opioid {{peptides}} have a tonic inhibitory {{control on}} LH secretion, {{participating in the}} func-tional changes of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. To evaluate {{the activity of the}} endogenous opioid systems during the oestrous cycle, we measured plasma LH levels after naloxone administration (5 mg/kg, s. c.) at 09. 00 and 16. 00 h on all days of the cycle (two further measurements were taken at 14. 00 and 18. 00 h on the day of pro-oestrus) and after one dose or one week's treatment with oestradiol benzoate (OB; 0 =. =m/rat). Concentrations of LH were measured in the same experimental models after injection of LH=req- releasing hormone (LHRH; 1 =m/kg, i. p.) or saline. Naloxone induced a significant rise in LH levels on the day of oestrus, <b>dioestrus</b> day- 1 and <b>dioestrus</b> day- 2; this response was blunted on the morning of pro=req- oestrus and absent in the afternoon and after acute and chronic OB treatment. Conversely LHRH was most effective in increasing LH levels on the day of pro=req- oestrus and in OB-treated rats. These results indicate that opioid mechanisms, independently of the time of day and the pituitary responsiveness, exhibit a reduced activity when pre-ovulatory changes occur, probably as a result of in-creased oestrogen levels.
