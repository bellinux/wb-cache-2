Strong leadership, which has helped promote democracy and overcome social and political strife, and a firm commitment to economic reform have been important determinants. The adoption of sound fiscal and monetary policies, supported by an appropriate exchange rate policy, and a proactive approach to removing structural impediments to private sector activity have had a positive bearing on investor sentiment.

They are needed to substantiate {{the transformation of the}} <b>investment</b> system, to identify the numerical values of the <b>investment</b> process, and to solve the problems that prevent the efficiency improvement of the <b>investment</b> system. As a result of the analysis, the authors have identified sixteen models that differ in the mode of <b>investment,</b> <b>investment</b> targets, types of investees, investors, <b>investment</b> sources, <b>investment</b> methods, <b>investment</b> schemes, repayment patterns, strategic goals, countries of origin, restrictions imposed on <b>investment</b> resources, payback patterns, <b>investment</b> period, economic system development, financing procedure, type of <b>investment</b> period alterations. The multiplicity and variety of <b>investment</b> models prevent us from performing a comprehensive comparative analysis; therefore, <b>investment</b> models are to be consolidated into classes that display higher-level systemic features. As a result of comprehensive comparison of existing <b>investment</b> models those models that are typical for the construction industry have been identified.
