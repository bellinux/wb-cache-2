2500|$|The machine had {{a feature}} called [...] "Stroke Storage" [...] that {{prevented}} two keys from being depressed simultaneously. When a key was depressed, an interposer, beneath the keylever, was pushed {{down into a}} slotted tube full of small metal balls (called the [...] "compensator tube") and spring latched. These balls were adjusted to have enough horizontal space for only one interposer to enter at a time. (Mechanisms much like this were used in keyboards for teleprinters before World War II.) If a typist pressed two keys simultaneously both interposers were blocked from entering the tube. [...] Pressing two keys several milliseconds apart allows the first interposer to enter the tube, tripping a clutch which rotated a fluted shaft driving the interposer horizontally {{and out of the}} tube. The powered horizontal motion of the interposer selected the appropriate rotate and tilt of the printhead for character selection, but also made way for the second interposer to enter the tube some milliseconds later, well before the first character had been printed. While a <b>full</b> <b>print</b> cycle was 65 milliseconds this filtering and storage feature allowed the typist to depress keys in a more random fashion and still print the characters in the sequence entered.|$|E

A minutia matching is mostly used for fingerprint recognition, and can be classified as ridge ending and ridge bifurcation. Palmprint matching is a challenging problem because latent prints large number of minutiae in <b>full</b> <b>prints,</b> {{and the presence of}} many creases in latents and <b>full</b> <b>prints.</b> A match score estimate using the local ridge direction and frequency in palmprints developed a highly robust algorithm. This facilitates the extraction of ridge and minutiae features even in poor quality palmprints [...] In this paper Fingerprint Recognition using Minutia Score Matching method. Distinctive information around each minutia is captured using a fixed-length minutia descriptor, Minutia Code andalignment-based minutiae matching algorithm is used to match two palmprints. In this paper person Verification based on fusion of Minutia Score Matching method for fingerprint and alignment-based minutiae matching algorithm for palmprints is presented...|$|R
