40|$|This paper {{proposed}} {{a method that}} combines Polar Fourier Transform, color moments, and vein features to retrieve leaf images based on a leaf image. The method is very useful {{to help people in}} recognizing <b>foliage</b> <b>plants.</b> <b>Foliage</b> <b>plants</b> are plants that have various colors and unique patterns in the leaf. Therefore, the colors and its patterns are information that should be counted on in the processing of plant identification. To compare the performance of retrieving system to other result, the experiments used Flavia dataset, which is very popular in recognizing plants. The result shows that the method gave better performance than PNN, SVM, and Fourier Transform. The method was also tested using <b>foliage</b> <b>plants</b> with various colors.

50|$|This {{plant is}} grown as an {{ornamental}} for its red fall foliage. It {{has also been}} useful in erosion control on denuded soils. It has been suggested {{as an agent of}} phytoremediation, because it is a hyperaccumulator of chromium, lead, mercury, selenium, silver, zinc, and uranium.Bassia scoparia contains higher levels of protein and oxalate than most grasses and fodder plants, thus it also serves as a good forage crop for livestock.

5000|$|It was {{introduced}} to Australia from South Africa around 1857, {{for use as a}} <b>foliage</b> <b>plant,</b> especially in bridal bouquets (hence the common name). It has escaped into the bush and smothers the native vegetation with the thick foliage and thick underground mat of tubers which restrict root growth of other species. It is recognised as one of the 20 [...] "weeds of national significance". The seeds are readily spread in the droppings of birds, rabbits and foxes, as well as the plant extending its root system.CSIRO have introduced several biological controls in an attempt to reduce the spread and impact of the weed.|$|E
50|$|A. aphylla is {{cultivated}} as a <b>foliage</b> <b>plant,</b> {{although it}} is actually a succulent and is adapted to harsh conditions. It grows fast, requires well-drained soils and will tolerate full sun. It can be pruned following flowering and pruning can be harsh, back to approximately 30 cm from the ground. Regrowth {{will take place in}} the next couple of months.It is both drought and frost tolerant can be grown from seed. It produces an abundance of seed during summer which stores well and remains viable for many years. It regenerates poorly in habitat and often there are few or no seedlings to be found. When cultivated, the hard black seeds need to be soaked for 24 hours, with initially boiled hot water, to soften the coating, which usually gives a consistent and early germination of seeds.|$|E

50|$|Curtis {{returned}} to England in 1879, {{but a year}} later {{was sent to the}} Dutch East Indies, where he explored Borneo, Sumatra, Java and the Moluccas. Veitch instructed him to collect specimens of Nepenthes northiana, which had been discovered by Marianne North in Borneo, although the precise locality where the plant grew was unknown. On the trip to Borneo, Curtis was accompanied by a young gardener, David Burke, who later became a plant collector himself. The search for the elusive pitcher plant was unsuccessful, but the pair discovered many other species, including many interesting stove (hot-house) plants, palms, and orchids. At the end of the trip, Curtis accompanied Burke to Singapore, from where Burke {{returned to}} England with the collection of plants, including large consignments of the slipper orchids, Paphiopedilum stonei and P. lowii, as well as many Vandas, Rhododendrons, and the beautiful <b>foliage</b> <b>plant</b> for British hot-houses, Leea amabilis.|$|E
50|$|Figs are {{keystone}} species in many rainforest ecosystems. Their fruit {{are a key}} resource for some frugivores including fruit bats, capuchin monkeys, langurs and mangabeys. They are even more important for some birds. Asian barbets, pigeons, hornbills, fig-parrots and bulbuls are examples of taxa that may almost entirely subsist on figs when these are in plenty. Many Lepidoptera caterpillars feed on fig leaves, for example several Euploea species (crow butterflies), the plain tiger (Danaus chrysippus), the giant swallowtail (Papilio cresphontes), the brown awl (Badamia exclamationis), and Chrysodeixis eriosoma, Choreutidae and Copromorphidae moths. The citrus long-horned beetle (Anoplophora chinensis), for example, has larvae that feed on wood, including that of fig trees; it can become a pest in fig plantations. Similarly, the sweet potato whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) is frequently found as a pest on figs grown as potted plants and is spread through the export of these plants to other localities. For a list of other diseases common to fig trees, see List of <b>foliage</b> <b>plant</b> diseases (Moraceae).|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that a plant and {{microorganisms}} inhabiting in the rhizosphere purifies an indoor air-pollutant.
