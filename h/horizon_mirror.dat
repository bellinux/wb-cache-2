50|$|The second <b>horizon</b> <b>mirror</b> was an {{interesting}} innovation. The telescope was removable. It could be remounted so that the telescope viewed the second <b>horizon</b> <b>mirror</b> from {{the opposite side of}} the frame. By mounting the two horizon mirrors at right angles to each other and permitting the movement of the telescope, the navigator could measure angles from 0 to 90° with one <b>horizon</b> <b>mirror</b> and from 90° to 180° with the other. This made the instrument very versatile. For unknown reasons, this feature was not implemented on octants in general use.|$|E

50|$|Index error:This {{occurs when}} the index and <b>horizon</b> <b>mirrors</b> are not {{parallel}} to each other when the index arm is set to zero. To test for index error, zero the index arm and observe the horizon. If the reflected and direct image of the horizon are in line there is no index error. If one is above the other adjust the index mirror until the two horizons merge. This can be done at night with a star or with the moon.|$|R

50|$|Observing {{through the}} telescope, the {{navigator}} would sight one object directly ahead. The second object {{would be seen}} by reflection in the <b>horizon</b> <b>mirror.</b> The light in the <b>horizon</b> <b>mirror</b> is reflected from the index mirror. By moving the index arm, the index mirror {{can be made to}} reveal any object up to 90° from the direct line of sight. When both objects are in the same view, aligning them together allows the navigator to measure the angular distance between them.|$|E
50|$|Whole-horizon sextants use a half-silvered <b>horizon</b> <b>mirror</b> {{to provide}} a {{full view of the}} horizon. This makes it easy to see when the bottom limb of a {{celestial}} object touches the horizon. Since most sights are of the sun or moon, and haze is rare without overcast, the low-light advantages of the half-horizon mirror are rarely important in practice.|$|E

50|$|Hadley's first {{reflecting}} quadrant was {{a simple}} device with a frame spanning a 45° arc. In the image at the right, from Hadley's article in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, {{you can see the}} nature of his design. A small sighting telescope was mounted on the frame along one side. One large index mirror was mounted at the point of rotation of the index arm. A second, smaller <b>horizon</b> <b>mirror</b> was mounted on the frame in the line of sight of the telescope. The <b>horizon</b> <b>mirror</b> allows the observer to see the image of the index mirror in one half of the view and to see a distant object in the other half. A shade was mounted at the vertex of the instrument to allow one to observe a bright object. The shade pivots to allow it {{to move out of the}} way for stellar observations.|$|E

5000|$|For a sun sight, {{a filter}} {{is used to}} {{overcome}} the glare such as [...] "shades" [...] covering both index mirror and the <b>horizon</b> <b>mirror</b> designed to prevent eye damage. By setting the index bar to zero, the sun can be viewed through the telescope. Releasing the index bar (either by releasing a clamping screw, or on modern instruments, using the quick-release button), {{the image of the}} sun can be brought down to about the level of the horizon. It is necessary to flip back the <b>horizon</b> <b>mirror</b> shade {{to be able to see}} the horizon, and then the fine adjustment screw on the end of the index bar is turned until the bottom curve (the lower limb) of the sun just touches the horizon. 'Swinging' the sextant about the axis of the telescope ensures that the reading is being taken with the instrument held vertically. The angle of the sight is then read from the scale on the arc, making use of the micrometer or vernier scale provided. The exact time of the sight must also be noted simultaneously, and the height of the eye above sea-level recorded.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new camera system called Horizon View Camera (HVC). The HVC {{is a system}} in which the optical axis of a camera is {{directed}} at the <b>horizon</b> with a <b>mirror</b> so that obtained image contains objects on the ground without including the ground itself. Therefore, by using the HVC system, separating objects from the ground becomes very easy. In this paper, we measured the distance to the object by using the obtained image actually and easily. Moreover, there are many other useful features in the HVC system. In order to improve the processing cost and accuracy, we propose a new idea whereby the detection of objects becomes easier and the results are more accurate by the experiment. ...|$|R
500|$|The {{telescope}} {{consists of}} a [...] f/2.5 primary mirror made by Owens-Illinois from Cervit, a zero-expansion glass-ceramic material, and ground by Grubb Parsons. The mirror blank was produced in 1969 {{as one of a}} set of four, along with those for the AAT, CFHT and Blanco telescopes, and was purchased for the WHT in 1979, ten years after it was made. The primary is solid and un-thinned, so no active optics system is required, despite its weight of [...] The mirror support cell holds the main mirror on a set of 60 pneumatic cylinders. Even under the most extreme loading (with the telescope pointing at the <b>horizon,</b> so the <b>mirror</b> is vertical) the shape of the mirror changes by only during normal operation the deformation is much smaller.|$|R
40|$|It is shown, {{that the}} horizon (2 -sphere) {{in fact is}} the central source point (r= 0) for a {{physical}} radius in Schwarzschild field and an interior of horizon does not exists. Such topological difference between Newtonnian and relativistic gravity leads to the observable effects. The light deflection and the perihelion shift are examples of topological effects. A reflection on the source of falling matter (<b>mirror</b> <b>horizon</b> effect), a hierarchy of supercompact stars after neutron stage - multibaryon, quark, (possible) subquark and other heavy particle stars are predicted instead of unphysical black holes. It is shown, that the cosmological singularity and quantum field theory divergencies are results of ignorance of the nontrivial topology of gravity near gravitational radius {{and they can be}} simly excluded by taking into account topology of gravity (the renormalization is a such prescription) ...|$|R

The back of the index mirror's holder is at the top and the three circular glass shades in square frames are between the two mirrors.|$|E
50|$|A {{sighting}} telescope (A-B), {{three or four}} feet long, was mounted along {{one side of the}} instrument. A <b>horizon</b> <b>mirror</b> was fixed at a 45° angle in front of the telescope's objective lens (G). This mirror was small enough to allow the observer to see the image in the mirror on one side and to see directly ahead on the other. The index arm (C-D) held an index mirror (H), also at 45° {{to the edge of the}} index arm. The reflective sides of the two mirrors nominally faced each other, so that the image seen in the first mirror is that reflected from the second.With the two mirrors parallel, the index reads 0°. The view through the telescope sees directly ahead on one side and the view from the mirror G sees the same image reflected from mirror H (see detail drawing to the right). When the index arm is moved from zero to a large value, the index mirror reflects an image that is in a direction away from the direct line of sight. As the index arm movement increases, the line of sight for the index mirror moves toward S (to the right in the detail image). This shows a slight deficiency with this mirror arrangement. The <b>horizon</b> <b>mirror</b> will block the view of the index mirror at angles approaching 90°.|$|E
50|$|He {{placed an}} index {{mirror on the}} index arm. Two horizon mirrors were provided. The upper mirror, {{in the line of}} the {{sighting}} telescope, was small enough to allow the telescope to see directly ahead as well as seeing the reflected view. The reflected view was that of the light from the index mirror. As in the previous instrument, the arrangement of the mirrors allowed the observer to simultaneously see an object straight ahead and to see one reflected in the index mirror to the <b>horizon</b> <b>mirror</b> and then into the telescope. Moving the index arm allowed the navigator to see any object within 90° of the direct view.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{studies the}} {{question}} of whether the classical mirror and synchronous couplings of two Brownian motions minimise and maximise, respectively, the coupling time of the corresponding geometric Brownian motions. We establish a characterisation of the optimality of the two couplings over any finite time horizon and show that, unlike in the case of Brownian motion, the optimality fails in general even if the geometric Brownian motions are martingales. On the other hand, we prove that in the cases of the ergodic average and the infinite time <b>horizon</b> criteria, the <b>mirror</b> coupling and the synchronous coupling are always optimal for general (possibly non-martingale) geometric Brownian motions. We show that the two couplings are efficient if and only if they are optimal over a finite time horizon and give a conjectural answer for the efficient couplings when they are suboptimal. 1...|$|R

40|$|It is shown, that a topological {{difference}} between Newtonnian and relativistic gravity leads to some observable effects and it allow predict {{a hierarchy of}} supercompact objects- multibaryonic, quark and (possible) subquark stars instead of black holes. A reflection on {{the source of a}} falling matter (<b>mirror</b> <b>horizon</b> effect) leads to a gravitational breathing of exterior layers of stars and a multiperiodicity of spectrum of supercompact stars (or nucleys of stars and galaxies). In the general relativity a creation and properties of supercompact objects with sizes near a gravitational radius can be considered from a point of view of physical time dependence of radial coordinate. In [1] I show, that as result we obtain a new physical picture for star evolution after neutron star stage with hierarchy of superdense (but ordinary) matter stars, instead of black holes. It is shown, that firstly, in general relativity a starting point of physical radius r = 0 is the horizon R(0) = rg, where R(r) is the standard Schwarzschild’s radius, rg is the gravitational radius. Secondly, a dependence of R from the physical time τ leads to the reflection on the horizon of the falling from infinity particles. The matter not ”penetrate ” to the interior of horizon and process is fully reversible in time. These facts lead to interesting and intriguing predictions in astrophysics. Detail consideration and discussion will be presented in [2]. Here I consider some qualitative predictions of this new version of general relativity of supercompact objects. The physical radial interval, measured by the radially oriented rest scale at the orbit R in the Schwarzschild field is: dr 2 = dR 2 1 − r...|$|R

In Germany, he visited Friedrich Bessel, Johann Franz Encke, and Heinrich Christian Schumacher and, in Paris, he called on François Arago. From there he also went to both Greenwich and Dublin, largely in pursuit of manufacturers of good chronographs. Back home he discussed with admiral Greig his impressions and ordered the equipment for the observatory. In his equipment there was a mercuric artificial <b>horizon</b> <b>mirror.</b> To exclude measurement failures {{it was possible to}} look with the telescope direct to the stars or indirect via the mercurial mirror.|$|E
