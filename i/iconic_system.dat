40|$|This study {{compared}} {{training in}} two language systems for three severely handicapped, nonvocal adolescents: the Bliss symbol system and an iconic picture system. Following baseline, training and review trials were implemented using an alternating treatments design. Daily probes {{were conducted to}} assess maintenance, stimulus generalization, and response generalization, and data were collected on spontaneous usage of either language system throughout the school day. Results showed that students required approximately {{four times as many}} trials to acquire Bliss symbols as iconic pictures, and that students maintained a higher percentage of iconic pictures. Stimulus generalization occurred in both language systems, while the number of correct responses during responses generalization probes was much greater for the <b>iconic</b> <b>system.</b> Finally, students almost always showed more iconic responses than Bliss responses in daily spontaneous usage.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the effect of Synthetic Vision System (SVS) and/or Enhanced Vision System (EVS) rendering of terrain features on pilot performance, including path control and situation awareness (SA), when presented in an advanced head-up display (HUD) during various phases of a landing approach under instrument meteorological conditions (IMCs). Results indicated that SVS imagery increase overall SA but degraded flight path control performance due to visual confusion with other display features. EVS increased flight path control accuracy but decreased system awareness by creating visual distractions for pilots (moisture returns), while they were focused on path control. The combination of SVS and EVS generated offsetting effects but there were still decrements in performance in the final landing phase due to overall HUD clutter. In general, display configurations in this study did not affect pilot spatial awareness but there was an influence on awareness of (<b>iconic)</b> <b>system</b> information. An IMC-day condition produced worse pilot performance than night flight because of reduced visual saliency of HUD information features. Flight performance was not different between phases of approach but levels and types of pilot SA did vary from leg to leg...|$|E
40|$|In language, a {{small number}} of {{meaningless}} building blocks can be combined into an unlimited set of meaningful utterances. This is known as combinatorial structure. One hypothesis for the initial emergence of combinatorial structure in language is that recombining elements of signals solves the problem of overcrowding in a signal space. Another hypothesis is that iconicity may impede the emergence of combinatorial structure. However, how these two hypotheses relate to each other is not often discussed. In this paper, we explore how signal space dimensionality relates to both overcrowding in the signal space and iconicity. We use an artificial signalling experiment to test whether a signal space and a meaning space having similar topologies will generate an <b>iconic</b> <b>system</b> and whether, when the topologies differ, the emergence of combinatorially structured signals is facilitated. In our experiments, signals are created from participants' hand movements, which are measured using an infrared sensor. We found that participants take advantage of iconic signal-meaning mappings where possible. Further, we use trajectory predictability, measures of variance, and Hidden Markov Models to measure the use of structure within the signals produced and found that when topologies do not match, then there is more evidence of combinatorial structure. The results from these experiments are interpreted {{in the context of the}} differences between the emergence of combinatorial structure in different linguistic modalities (speech and sign) ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with introducing <b>iconic</b> pictograph <b>systems</b> that were created by Buddhist priests {{more than three hundred}} years ago to help illiterate people recite important Buddhist sutras.

The present paper will first discuss the importance of form in Japanese culture, introduce the Heart Sutra and the notion of mantra, and then illustrate how the pictographs could induce the desired pronuciation for reciting the Heart Sutra.

Since the appearance of the theory of arbitrariness of a linguistic sign there have been numerous attempts to contest it. In an attempt to establish a consistent approach to the study of linguistic iconicity in its connection to the problem of the motivation of a linguistic sign as well as in connection to the study of expressive potential of language, the new discipline of phonosemantics was established.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 114 - 125) The {{purpose of}} this study was to investigate the interaction of language function and memory by comparing the short-term verbal and iconic memory capacities of a selected aphasic population to those of a matched non-brain-damaged population. Forty-eight adult males (24 aphasic subjects and 24 non-brain-damaged subjects) were each randomly assigned to two experimental cells, one involving serial learning and one involving recognition memory. These cells consisted of seven concrete words or pictures presented at either a fast or slow rate. Subjects participated individually. After each of the eight trials given in each experimental cell, the subject pointed to his responses on a prepared board. Depending on which task was involved, he either serialized the seven response cards or chose as many as he could remember from a field of fourteen cards. The results indicate that while overall memory capacities are depressed, the aphasic population performs best in a recognition task involving pictures, possibly because the subjects are able to compensate for the damaged verbal system by using the alternate <b>iconic</b> <b>system.</b> They have difficulty serializing under any conditions, possibly because an intact verbal system is required for such a task. In addition, differences exist between the serial learning performance patterns of the two populations, while recognition memory apparently allows the aphasic population to more closely approximate the memory patterns of the non-brain-damaged population. Finally, no relationship was found between the degree of language impairment as measured by the PICA and the level of memory performance...|$|E
