6000|$|... "Well, some <b>folks</b> <b>do</b> {{like to be}} stupid," [...] snapped Peter {{and hurried}} on, lipperty-lipperty-lip, while Prickly Porky slowly shuffled and rattled along behind.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{a strange}} affair very strange!" [...] {{declared}} the Guardian. [...] "But you seem harmless. <b>Folks</b> <b>do</b> not smile so delightfully when they mean mischief." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, but it's {{nothing but}} right {{you should have}} a small percentage," [...] said Mr. Glegg. [...] "I've no opinion o' {{transactions}} where <b>folks</b> <b>do</b> things for nothing. It allays looks bad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello!" [...] exclaimed Old Mother Nature, as Happy Jack and Chatterer {{appeared}} with Peter Rabbit. [...] "What are you frisky <b>folks</b> <b>doing</b> over here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't feel much. I didn't {{know what}} to feel. Other <b>folks</b> <b>did</b> such a lot of feeling, I thought I'd better keep my mouth shut." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "True. Yet how <b>folk</b> <b>do</b> worship fine clothes! Now there's a better-looking woman {{than she}} that nobody notices at all, because she's akin to that hontish fellow Henchard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "William, for shame!" [...] exclaimed Caroline warmly. [...] "If <b>folks</b> <b>do</b> hate him, it is {{to their}} disgrace, not his. Mr. Moore himself hates nobody. He only wants to do his duty, and {{maintain}} his rights. You are wrong to talk so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't {{silly to}} be fond of her, is it? She is so nice and funny, {{and tries to}} be good, and likes me, and I won't be ashamed of my friends, if <b>folks</b> <b>do</b> laugh," [...] protested Jack, with a rap of his teaspoon.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's jist that, Pop; and I ez good ez let 'em know I seed it. I ain't a fool, if some <b>folks</b> <b>do</b> {{drop their}} eyes and pertend to wipe the laugh out of their noses with a {{handkerchief}} when I let out to speak. I mayn't be good enough kempany--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eh, {{preserve}} us, sirs!" [...] {{said the}} butcher's wife, [...] "there's ten-- eleven--twall letters to Tennant and Co.--thae <b>folk</b> <b>do</b> mair business than a' the rest o' the burgh." ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{the evening}} her father, {{who knew that}} the note had come, said, [...] "Why be ye not sitting down to answer your letter? That's what young <b>folks</b> <b>did</b> in my time." ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{a general}} scramble, commingled with shrieks of {{laughter}} as the young <b>folks</b> <b>did</b> their best to locate the missing couple. Then of a sudden came a wild toot from an automobile horn.|$|R
6000|$|... 3. Your Howland School {{children}} do the construction-work, stage-decorations, etc. That is our way too. Our young <b>folks</b> <b>do</b> {{everything that is}} needed by the theatre, with their own hands; scene-designing, scene-painting, gas-fitting, electric work, costume-designing--costume making, everything and all things indeed--and their orchestra and its leader are from their own ranks.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pooh!" [...] said Flo, [...] "don't {{you try to}} be intellectual, for you {{are only}} a wooden-headed doll. I mean {{to be a real}} Westerner, and just enjoy myself as I please, without caring what other <b>folks</b> <b>do</b> or think. Boston is no better {{than the rest of the}} world, I guess." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I presume I {{will have}} to make a clean breast of it. Toglet is more or less insane. His <b>folks</b> <b>do</b> not care to place him in an asylum, and so I offered {{to take care of him}} for a while. It was his sudden fit of {{insanity}} that caused all of the trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Andy and Randy {{are simply}} chips {{of the old}} block," [...] laughed Dick Rover. [...] "I suppose we'll all have to <b>do</b> as our <b>folks</b> <b>did</b> with us--send the lads off to some strict {{boarding}} school." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My folks {{lived in}} America a long time," [...] Billy said slowly, digesting the {{information}} {{she had given}} and relating himself to it. [...] "Anyway, my mother's <b>folks</b> <b>did.</b> They crossed to Maine hundreds of years ago." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{the beating}} of the beast's tail against the reeds which awakened Tarzan. Jungle <b>folk</b> <b>do</b> not awaken slowly--instantly, full {{consciousness}} and full command of their every faculty returns to them from the depth of profound slumber.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} don't feel so," [...] Dane said shortly. [...] "Several {{things have}} gone wrong with me lately, and I'm even more troubled than usual by a chronic shortness of capital. I want ten thousand pounds rather more badly than most <b>folks</b> <b>do,</b> and no mental effort will show me where to raise more than five." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm real {{glad you}} like it: most <b>folks</b> <b>do,</b> if they don't mind it being plain and quiet up here. It's gayer {{down at the}} hotel, but the air ain't half so good, and {{delicate}} folks generally like our old place best," [...] answered Becky, as she tossed over a mattress and shook out the sheets with a brisk, capable air pleasant to see.|$|E
6000|$|The {{drinking}} of the cocktails was as canonical a rite as the mixing. The company waited, uneasily, hopefully, agreeing in {{a strained}} manner {{that the weather}} had been rather warm and slightly cold, but still Babbitt said nothing about drinks. They became despondent. But when the late couple (the Swansons) had arrived, Babbitt hinted, [...] "Well, <b>folks,</b> <b>do</b> {{you think you could}} stand breaking the law a little?" ...|$|E
50|$|At {{first there}} were some several hundred rioters. This rose to a peak of up to 10,000 rioters. The white <b>folk</b> <b>did</b> not want blacks {{to be in their}} community. The rioters cried out against Negroes, Jews and Communists.|$|R
6000|$|... "He'm werry sing'lar how a young <b>folk</b> <b>do</b> forget! 'Ere war' drown {{six people}} in dat werry-boat. A two Yankee, a Canada Frenchman, and a poor woman from a Jarseys. Ebbery body war werry sorry for a poor woman from a Jarseys!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{shall we}} come at him then?" [...] he answered. [...] "We may not go up that {{mountain}} path, for two men can {{hold it against}} all our strength, and <b>folk</b> <b>do</b> not love to meet Eric and Skallagrim in a narrow way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Every man to his taste. You {{never could}} get {{learning}} to stick on me, and I {{did not look}} for it. She knows what other <b>folks</b> <b>do,</b> and likes nothing better than a book. She {{is good enough for}} me; and you must take to her, mother, even if she is not quite up to your mark in the ologies. Won't you? Indeed, she is a good little Violet!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dorothy is right, your Majesty," [...] {{asserted}} the Sorceress. [...] "It is true we {{know nothing}} of these faraway subjects, except that they intend to fight one another, and have {{a certain amount of}} magic power at their command. Such <b>folks</b> <b>do</b> not like to submit to interference and {{they are more likely to}} resent your coming among them than to receive you kindly and graciously, as is your due." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, younglings, codlings, {{and other}} fry, that's {{the way we}} old folks used to dance. I'm not saying {{anything}} against the new dances, mind you. They're all right and dandy fine. But just the same it wouldn't injure you much to learn to waltz properly. The way you waltz, when you do attempt it, is a scream. We old <b>folks</b> <b>do</b> know {{a thing or two}} that is worth while." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, truly, some <b>folk</b> <b>do</b> {{call him}} a great archer," [...] said Robin Hood, [...] "but we of Nottinghamshire are famous hands with the longbow. Even I, though but a simple hand at the craft, would not fear to try a bout with thee." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! {{that was}} where we saw him,' said Nan. 'Madame, indeed there was nothing exaggerated in the tumult. It was frightful. They made ten times the noise our honest <b>folk</b> <b>do</b> in England, and did ten times less. If they had been English, M. Broussel would be safe at home now!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I nebber sarve anoder gentleum; Misser Marble," [...] {{returned}} the black; [...] "dat as sartain as gospel. I born in 'e Wallingford family, and I lib an' die in 'e same family, or I don't want to lib and die, at all. My real name be Wallingford, dough <b>folk</b> <b>do</b> call me Clawbonny." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's {{always been}} a habit of mine, in these little matters,' he went on, 'to let other <b>folks</b> <b>do</b> the rough work, and chip in myself when they've cleared the way. It saves trouble and expense. I don't travel with a gang, like that bone-headed Buck. What's {{the use of a}} gang? They only get {{tumbling}} over each other and spoiling everything. Look at Buck! Where is he? Down and out. While I--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's our {{implement}} man, an' hardware dealer. Bob {{were the}} on'y one o' the Millville folks thet could git along with Cap'n Wegg, an' even he didn't manage {{to be any}} special friend. Bob's rich, ye know. Rich as blazes. <b>Folks</b> <b>do</b> say he's wuth ten thousan' dollars; but it don't set Bob up any. He jest minds his business an' goes on sellin' plows an' harvesters to the farmers an' takin' notes fer 'em." ...|$|E
60|$|It seems {{odd that}} a fairy {{should have a}} birthday, for fairies, they say, were born at the {{beginning}} of time and live forever. Yet, on the other hand, {{it would be a shame}} to deprive a fairy, who has so many other good things, of the delights of a birthday. So we need not wonder that the fairies keep their birthdays just as other <b>folks</b> <b>do,</b> and consider them occasions for feasting and rejoicing.|$|E
50|$|Work on {{the quick}} each day, as simple <b>folk</b> must <b>do.</b>|$|R
60|$|And the old priest put out {{the waning}} fires Save that one lamp whose restless ruby glowed For ever in the cell, and the shrill lyres Came fainter on the wind, as down the road In joyous dance these country <b>folk</b> <b>did</b> pass, And with stout hands the warder closed the gates of {{polished}} brass.|$|R
50|$|A {{persistent}} rumour on the Web {{holds that}} Durin IV was the king {{who led the}} Dwarves from Khazad-dûm to fight against Sauron with the Last Alliance {{at the end of}} the Second Age. Tolkien indicates that Dwarves of Durin's <b>Folk</b> <b>did</b> fight with the Last Alliance, but he does not say under which king they fought.|$|R
