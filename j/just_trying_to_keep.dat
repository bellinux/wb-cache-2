But mainly it's just the play calling, it's a lot longer than what it was in college, but all-in-all it's just learning a whole new terminology, some things are similar, but it's the words that they use are different. So it's all about adjustment. A lot of intelligence out there, they don't make mistakes. They are pretty mature on what they are doing. I am trying to build up to that, because {{a lot of them are}} veterans and have been there for a while. They understand what is going on, and I am <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up and not make them look bad." ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{considered}} this prospect ruefully; and then {{making the best}} of it, [...] "Upon all which accounts," [...] said I, [...] "the best will be to get across the Border and there separate.

50|$|Thirty {{years after}} leaving {{national}} politics, Wiegel is still mentioned {{often as a}} potential Prime Minister. He still is very popular among People's Party for Freedom and Democracy party members in the Netherlands. He has 'threatened' to return to national politics a number of times, usually resulting in the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy going up in the polls. His opponents admonish this behaviour, implying that he is <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> himself from being forgotten.|$|E
5000|$|The case is very {{personal}} for Detective Lindsay (Bush) because her missing half-brother Teddy (Pucci) might be somehow involved. [...] "It really knocks her sideways," [...] Olmstead says of Lindsay's personal {{connection to the}} case. [...] "She admits that she's <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> her head on straight because she has so many competing emotions while trying to be objective and do her job. ... There's some hard-earned advice that Benson is able to impart to Lindsay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{we will go}} on as we are {{as long as we}} can; let us <b>just</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{our feet}} and give way to the sea as it rakes us along.

5000|$|... “I started {{very well}} and my swing felt good all day,” he said. “I {{struggled}} a little yesterday, but today it was really good. I didn’t make any mistakes and it feels great to be the winner. Although I had a lead, I <b>just</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> playing one shot at a time,” he added. “The guys made some bogeys behind me and that made the gap even bigger but I just kept playing my own game and {{it all worked out}} perfectly. It feels awesome." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with APN, Lloyd said; [...] "When I was asked to do this record last year I didn't have a whole record myself to put out {{so it was a}} good opportunity for me to go back and play around with some old stuff" [...] adding [...] "I really <b>just</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it simple and beautiful, minimalizing the amount of instrumentation and really <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> make a nice record in a short amount of time.

5000|$|Despite the {{occasional}} setback, his Drury Lane Theater empire grew steadily and DeSantis became a wealthy man. He {{was opposed to}} Chicago mafia involvement in Chicago show business and in 1958 was involved in an FBI sting against the Chicago mob. This led to a retaliatory explosion in his Martinique nightclub in 1962. In reflecting on his life in 2005, DeSantis said:"I suppose I could sit on a bench and drink martinis with a starlet on each arm. Nah. I work hard because I am <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> alive." ...|$|E

Eventually The City of New York dropped all charges, including making terrorist threats and disorderly conduct. Since then Lipari has received offers from lawyers pushing him to sue New York City for wrongful imprisonment, but {{he has no plans to}} sue. When Emily Epstein from Metro New York pressed him as to why, he replied [...] "I'd rather be rich on my own accord, not by suing the people who are <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> us safe." ...|$|E
50|$|Nick Stone {{left the}} SAS in 1988, {{soon after the}} {{shooting}} of three IRA volunteers in Gibraltar. Once working for British Intelligence as a 'K' on deniable operations, he also briefly worked for an American agency. Now he roams the world as somewhat of a mercenary <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his head above water. Early novels are accounts of assassination and intrigue filled with tradecraft and detail. Later novels, while still detailed, deal with more social topics such as White slavery/prostitution, government corruption, war profiteering, Human rights and torture with Nick never having answers to these complicated topics, but normally just bearing witness.|$|E
60|$|Poor Peter! His coat {{had already}} been badly torn by the cruel claws of Hooty the Owl, and Old Mother Nature hadn't had time to mend it when he fought with the old gray Rabbit. After the second time Peter didn't <b>try</b> <b>to</b> fight again. He <b>just</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> out of the way. And he did, too. But in doing it he lost so much sleep and he had so little to eat that he grew thin and thin and thinner, until, with his torn clothes, {{he looked like a}} scarecrow.|$|R
2500|$|Wieringo {{explained}} the philosophy behind his drawing style thus: [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> things fun. I {{like to do}} fun comics. It doesn't have to be realistic to be believable. In fact, I sometimes think that funny [...] might actually add something to certain books." [...] When he began illustrating the Rogue miniseries, he was intimidated by the dark tone of that book's story, but once he finished the first issue, the editors decided to light up the [...] "grim and gritty" [...] tone of the story.|$|R
5000|$|I {{started the}} song at Julian Wu's house in Melbourne. Ah, {{the end of}} a {{beautiful}} era ... One morning I sat bolt upright in bed and virtually all the lyrics appeared instantly. I <b>just</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it as blunt and direct as possible, even if the results made myself or the listener squirm ... I finished the music at a sound-check somewhere in Europe. Like the rest of the Born Sandy Devotional album, it seemed to naturally evoke a particular landscape, namely the stretch of highway in between Caiguna and Norseman, where the Triffids' Hi-Ace monotonously came to grief with kangaroos.

In 1943 at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, she performed in Present Laughter and This Happy Breed on alternate nights under the umbrella title of Play Parade, before playing Elvira in the West End presentation of Blithe Spirit at the Duchess Theatre in 1943. During one performance on tour, {{she was surprised to}} feel Coward stroking her shoulder in an affectionate way that was not called-for in the script, and she began to wonder [...] "Have I succeeded where so many women have failed?" [...] In fact, he was <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his hands warm in an unheated theatre during fuel rationing.|$|E
5000|$|... (voiced by Jess Harnell) - Grim is a warlock and Hildy's husband. In [...] "The Jollywood Jam", it is {{revealed}} that Grim's great-great-great-grandfather was a warlock who {{was defeated by}} the Founders of Jollywood. Harnell describes him as [...] "a bad-at-being-bad guy". Regarding {{his role as a}} Disney villain, he said that [...] "there's a fine line — especially in 7D, which is a broad comedy — because you don't want to scare little kids". He said [...] "Grim is so awesome because he's totally stupid but he's got a really good heart. He's actually not a bad guy, he's <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up with his wife, which I guess a lot of us can relate to".|$|E

5000|$|Fricke and Magidson {{emphasized}} {{avoiding a}} particular political view in assembling the film. Fricke said, [...] "We <b>just</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{it in the}} middle and then we form little blocks of content and then we set them aside until we had enough. We did all of this without music or sound effects. We just let the image guide the flow and then we started stringing the blocks together." [...] Nicolas Rapold of the New York Times wrote that Samsara's lack of a specific message is [...] "a departure from similarly expansive, globally conscious nonfiction films in vogue now, like the critically acclaimed work of Michael Glawogger ('Workingman's Death,' which depicts the same sulfur mines as 'Samsara') and Nikolaus Geyrhalter ('Abendland') that also serve as probing sociological critique." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We broke an oar {{coming off}} the beach that night, {{and it kind of}} {{crippled}} us," [...] he said. [...] "Twice she nearly went back again in the surf, and I don't quite know how we pulled her off. Anyway, one of us was busy heaving out the water that broke into her. It was Jake, I think, and he seemed kind of silly. Once we saw a boat hove up on a sea, but we lost her in the spray, and a long while after we saw the schooner. Just then a comber that broke on board most hove us over, and when we had dodged the next two there wasn't a sign of her. After that we knew that we were done, and we <b>just</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> her head-to and ease her to the seas." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} {{just prior to}} the Southeastern Conference (SEC) Championships (in March 2014), when asked about trouble with her hip, Katherine replied that she had been “having trouble with it all year” and had been doing “the least amount of skills possible, <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it as healthy as possible.” Asked about the likely impact of this in the SEC competition, she said that she had been dealing with it all year, since before the season started” and that this was just another day. Asked about specific goals, she said that she wanted to do well in her routines and that in her last SEC competition, she just wanted “to really have fun”. [...] At the competition, following a vote of all the coaches, she was named SEC Gymnast of the Year.|$|E
5000|$|Take Charge Lady was ridden {{in most of}} {{her early}} races by Tony D'Amico. The filly made her debut by winning a maiden race at Keeneland in April, but was then off the track for almost five months before {{returning}} to win an allowance race over one mile at Turfway Park in September. Four weeks later Take Charge Lady was moved up in class distance and started at odds of 5.8/1 for the Grade II Alcibiades Stakes over {{eight and a half}} furlong at Keeneland. D'Amico tracked the favorite Never Out before sending his mount into the lead early in the stretch and winning by a length. McPeek described the winner as [...] "just class top to bottom... she's very, very, very special", before adding [...] "I'm <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> from messing her up".|$|E
50|$|Reutimann {{caused a}} {{controversy}} at the April Martinsville race when the No. 10 Tommy Baldwin Racing Chevrolet stalled on lap 497, drawing a caution. He {{was accused of}} intentionally causing the caution after limping around the track for a few laps at speeds well below {{the rest of the}} field. The result was a broken timing belt and Reutimann was credited with a 35th-place finish. He insists he was <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the car in the Top 35 in owner's points; the team left Martinsville just one point outside a guaranteed start. Reutimann qualified for the next race at Texas and finished 26th, getting the No. 10 back into the Top 35. During Coca Cola 600 qualifying, David did not qualify fast enough in the No. 73 BK Racing entry and missed his first Cup race since 2007.|$|E
50|$|Back in the present, Angel is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> locate Darla, {{over the}} {{objections}} of the group, who suggest Wolfram and Hart may <b>just</b> be <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> him distracted. Gunn suggests that they probably have connections to the place where she`s staying, and Angel gives criteria for the kind of place she would want to live. They go off to check into it.|$|R
50|$|When the 890T {{engine was}} {{introduced}} in , it had comparable power to the BMW, Renault and Ferrari turbo engines which at times saw lead driver Andrea de Cesaris able to mix it with the quicker cars, while fuel was not a factor as in-race re-fuelling was allowed. By 1984 however, the 890T {{had been left behind}} on power by its rivals, while the new fuel regulations limiting cars to only 220 litres per race saw the Alfa's mostly uncompetitive in the races as the engine was notoriously hard on fuel consumption. Also, the lack of power saw both Patrese and Cheever having to push their 184T's harder <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> in touch (more often than not this was a losing battle) and most of the 184T's retirements were due to the unreliability of the engine that the faster running produced, or the cars simply ran out of fuel.|$|R
5000|$|Dr. Kyi Thar (Myat Lay), {{who works}} at the {{intensive-care}} unit, Mental Health Hospital, Yangon, and the patient Ma Htar Htar (Myat Mon), an elder sister of a friend. They met {{for the very first time}} on his duty. Though the friend¹s family was from Mandalay, they came to Yangon, to Dr. Kyi Thar to take the medical treatment with great expectations. They were right as she was getting much better as time went by and in their relationship too. Both of them knew they were deeply in love, attached to each other without mentioning a thing. It was the patient, who <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> start a new beginning of their close relationship on the day they went out together. However, he severed relations with her against his will as he thought it was the best thing <b>to</b> do. He <b>just</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his morals as a doctor. But their separation left her with the feeling of deep hurt instead. She got worse when they met again after some time. The poor patient asked again her beloved doctor to go out together with a pat expression, [...] "let's go out, anywhere!".|$|R
5000|$|The {{character}} of Piper Halliwell was conceived by Burge, {{who wrote the}} pilot script for Charmed. The pilot script was based around three mismatched sisters who are initially based on Burge and her two older sisters, Laura and Edie Burge. Piper is based on Burge's second-oldest sister Edie. On creating Piper, Burge stated [...] "The middle sibling typically {{tends to be a}} real people pleaser and very funny, tends to deal with life with a lot of humour. That really applied to my sister, Edie and so I could see the {{character of}} Piper her." [...] Executive producer Brad Kern stated that Piper was written into the series as [...] "the middle sister <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the peace, trying to find love, trying to find her career, and trying to keep Prue and Phoebe from killing each other." ...|$|E
5000|$|Air Force Brigadier General Brad Webb {{was sitting}} at the table {{monitoring}} the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound when Michael Leiter, then Director of the United States National Counterterrorism Center, entered the room. Leiter does not appear in the photograph, but was followed by Robert Gates, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and others. Soon the President entered the room, commenting [...] "I need to watch this," [...] and sat down next to General Webb. According to journalist Peter Bergen, the group was watching a live feed from an unmanned drone flying overhead. The Daily Mail reported that Obama was able to watch the exact moment that bin Laden was killed, but Leon Panetta said this was not the case. Clinton said: [...] "We could see or hear nothing when SEALs went into the house. There was no communication or feedback coming so it was during that time period everyone was particularly focused on <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> calm and keep prepared as to what would happen." ...|$|E
5000|$|There are, however, some few {{positive}} remarks from critics, one saying, [...] "This L.A. blues {{guitar player}} {{is a guy}} who has everyone else <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up as he pulls off endless incendiary guitar solos. This is Gordon's fourth album, with a fifth threatened for an early '99 release. Here's a guy who attracts guitar players who show up to watch and take notes. GRADE: A-" [...] Regarding Gordon's album, Extremely Dangerous Blues, another reviewer expressed, [...] "Although these performances are mostly fairly brief, {{there is no shortage of}} inventive ideas within the context of rockish Chicago blues, or any loss of passion." [...] Other reviewers, view Gordon's larger-than-life playing to be ambitious, stating, [...] "Gordon doesn't believe in understatement or simplicity. While his songs tell about overcoming heartache, being an outcast, partying all night long, and starting up a relationship, each one comes loaded with fire. The lyrics may be difficult to understand, but Gordon's powerhouse guitar leaves no doubt that he means business." ...|$|E
5000|$|Only four fillies {{appeared}} to oppose Minding {{when she was}} matched against older horses {{for the first time}} in the Pretty Polly Stakes over ten furlongs at the Curragh on 26 June. Ridden by Moore, she went off the 1/5 favourite ahead of Koora (St Simon Stakes) and Lucida (Rockfel Stakes), Speedy Boarding (Prix Corrida) and Bocca Baciata (Dance Design Stakes). Bocca Baciata set the pace and was more than six lengths clear of her rivals entering the straight, but Minding took the lead inside the final furlong and drew away to win by four and a half lengths with a gap of five lengths back to Lucida in third. Minding was then sent back to England for the Group One Nassau Stakes over ten furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse on 30 July and started the 1/5 favourite against four opponents. She met some trouble in running and was not particularly impressive in prevailing by one and a quarter lengths from Queen's Trust, a filly whose best previous effort had been a fourth place in the Ribblesdale Stakes. Ryan Moore commented [...] "It was always going to be a messy sort of race. I <b>just</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it as simple as I could. She was only doing what she had to do".|$|R
2500|$|In late December 1967, drummer Nick Mason {{approached}} Gilmour {{and asked}} him if he would be interested in joining Pink Floyd. He accepted and soon afterward became their fifth member; they initially intended to continue with Barrett as a non-performing songwriter. One of the group's business partners, Peter Jenner, commented: [...] "The idea was that Dave would... cover for Barrett's eccentricities and when that got to be not workable, Syd was just going <b>to</b> write. <b>Just</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> him involved". By March 1968, working with Barrett had become too difficult, so Pink Floyd met with business partners Jenner and Andrew King to discuss the situation. During the meeting, Barrett agreed to leave the band and the others committed to moving on without him. Waters later admitted: [...] "He was our friend, {{but most of the time}} we now wanted to strangle him". Jenner and King, who believed Barrett to be the creative genius of the band, decided to represent him and end their partnership with Pink Floyd.|$|R
5000|$|Series 5 to 7 {{featured}} Bodger and Badger {{living in}} a rented bedsit flat. This {{was the beginning of}} the show's best-remembered period, its [...] "imperial phase", series 5-7. Badger met his new friend Mousey in Series 5, a mouse who lived under the floorboards. <b>Just</b> as Bodger <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Badger's presence hidden from figures of authority, Badger kept Mousey's presence a secret from Bodger, because Bodger <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> get rid of Mousey in the first episode of Series 5 by setting traps for her.|$|R
