Basal blood glucose level is approximately 5mM (5 millimolar). The <b>Km</b> <b>value</b> (an indicator of the affinity of the transporter protein for glucose molecules; a low <b>Km</b> <b>value</b> suggests a high affinity) of the GLUT1 and GLUT3 proteins is 1mM; therefore GLUT1 and GLUT3 have a high affinity for glucose and uptake from the bloodstream is constant.

40|$|The radiolabeled leucine {{incorporation}} {{technique for}} quantifying rates of bacterial production {{has increased in}} popularity since its original description for bacterioplankton communities. Prior studies addressing incorporation conditions (e. g., substrate saturation) for bacterial communities in other habitats, such as decaying plant litter, have reported {{a wide range of}} final leucine concentrations (400 nM to 50 μM) required to achieve saturation-level uptake. We assessed the application of the [3 H]leucine incorporation procedure for measuring bacterial production on decaying wetland plant litter. Substrate saturation experiments (nine concentrations, 10 nM to 50 μM final leucine concentration) were conducted on three dates for microbial communities colonizing the submerged litter of three emergent plant species (Typha angustifolia, Schoenoplectus validus, and Phragmites australis). A modified [3 H]leucine protocol was developed by coupling previously described incubation and alkaline extraction protocols with microdialysis (500 molecular weight cutoff membrane) of the final radiolabeled protein extract. The incorporation of [3 H]leucine into protein exhibited a biphasic saturation curve, with lower apparent <b>Km</b> <b>values</b> ranging from 400 nM to 4. 2 μM depending on the plant species studied. Upper apparent <b>Km</b> <b>values</b> ranged from 1. 3 to 59 μM.

Moreover, RDH13 is much has much more efficient reductase activity than dehydrogenase activity.

However, the kcat value of RDH13 for retinaldehyde reduction. arable with that of RDH11, and the Km values of the two enzymes for NADPH are also very similar.
