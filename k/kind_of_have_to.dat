500|$|The album {{title was}} chosen {{in part because}} of nostalgia for the {{historical}} name of the backspace key on typewriters that went out of use in the 1950s and also as a reference to looking back on one's life.

Vedder said, [...] "Backspacer [...] actually you <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{go back and look at}} your mistake."

5000|$|The {{first season}} of Teen Titans aired on Cartoon Network. The season aired on Kids WB Saturday mornings at 8:30 A.M. EST, {{beginning}} on November 1, 2003. The series was first greenlit in late September 2002, with Japanese-American animator Glen Murakami signed on. The series' creation {{was inspired by}} the success of Justice League, based on DC Comics characters. However, as opposed to Justice League and other DC animated television series, the intention behind Teen Titans was to create the series for a younger audience. Series producer and animator Glen Murakami noted that the series is [...] "lighter and has humor" [...] while staying true to the [...] "intent of the characters." [...] Murakami also noted that the process of transforming material from the comics into material suitable for the target audience was similar to what was done with both Batman: The Animated Series and Batman Beyond: [...] "We <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take into consideration that were not making this cartoon just for fans of the comic book, the ones who know all the backstory and know all the continuity.

[...] The series' mixes American style animation with Japanese anime. According to Murakami, the incorporating of anime came naturally, noting that he and Tim were anime fans and the increased presence of anime at the time.|$|E
