The original publication is available at [URL] research reported here examined the engineer <b>occupational</b> <b>course</b> curricula presented by the South African Army School of Engineers. Methodology involved examination of all enabling learning objectives for the Corps Training Course (701 ENGR 006), the Troop Officers Course (701 ENGR 103), the Troop Commanders Course (701 ENGR 16) and the Squadron Commanders Course (701 ENGR 17). The research determined the number of learning objectives dedicated to terrain analysis and whether those learning objectives were linked to an assessment to determine competency levels for terrain analysis. The study used content analysis to determine the presence of terrain analysis content in the course curricula and to make recommendations. Data have been collected from analysis of the first four <b>occupational</b> <b>course</b> curricula presented to officers of the Engineer Corps as mentioned above, books, army field manuals and occasional papers. Recommendations are that the learning objectives dedicated to terrain analysis should be expanded and better focused and that assessment instruments capable of measuring competency in terrain analysis should be created and/or improved. An additional recommendation is that exercises are needed during the <b>occupational</b> <b>courses</b> that require officers to assimilate the effect of terrain on operations {{in order to improve}} officers’ terrain analysis competencies.

When the <b>occupational</b> therapy <b>course</b> was implemented at the Faculty of Medicine of University of São Paulo, I became interested and enrolled in the <b>course.</b> <b>Occupational</b> Therapy was then known as Labor Therapy. This fact occurred as a consequence of a poliomyelitis outbreak in 1950. The special treatment required by those patients became an emergency; however, there were no specialized professionals to aid in the rehabilitation of those patients. As a result, some specialized professionals, including occupational therapists, came from the United States of America to teach in Brazil. The Rehabilitation Institute of the Faculty of Medicine, University of São Paulo opened the first <b>Occupational</b> Therapy <b>course,</b> taught in two years. Later, I started working as an OT teacher at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of São Paulo, where I remained for 32 years.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to cast light on the {{neglected}} ‘walking phenomenon’ (Morton, 2002) of women’s uneven participation in Cyprus primary school management and to investigate the reasons causing it. More specifically, the research offers insights into women’s experiences of progressing to and experiencing primary school principalship in Cyprus from 1961 to 2010; examines whether {{and to what extent}} these experiences have changed over the last five decades; and maps the reasons women leaders provide for their disproportionate representation in principalship over this period. Underpinned by the principle of ‘fitness for purpose’ (Cohen et al., 2007), the interpretive paradigm, a qualitative approach (narrative inquiry), snowball sampling, semi-structured in-depth narrative interviewing of 23 retired and in-service women principals as well as thematic analysis are adopted. With regard to women’s experiences of progressing to principalship, the findings suggest that women educators in primary education between 1961 and 2010 had generally been non-leadership oriented; <b>had</b> <b>followed</b> fairly unplanned <b>occupational</b> trajectories; and thus had needed external encouragement to enhance their confidence and set themselves on the pathway to principalship. Participants had been fairly unaware of discriminatory dynamics during the interview for promotion. In terms of women’s experiences of principalship, the outcomes indicate that, despite a growing positive ethos, stereotypical preconceptions identified in the school, community and family contexts regarding women in leadership posts – particularly of younger age – persist. The comparison of women’s experiences of progressing to and experiencing primary school principalship in Cyprus between 1961 and 2010 reveals comparable conducive and/or impeding impacts on women’s advancement as well as on their leadership role as such, throughout the period under consideration. A range of reasons for women’s disproportionate representation in primary school principalship are proposed by narrators that fall in three intersected levels coined in this thesis: a) the Macro level: Socio-cultural barriers, b) the Meso level: Institutional barriers and c) the Micro level: Personal/Psychological barriers.

40|$|Many {{academic}} innovations {{over the}} last 20 years demonstrate how occupational science has matured as a discipline (Pierce, 2012). However, the paucity of scholarship {{of teaching and learning}} in occupational science highlights a continued need for disciplinary growth. Specifically, little scholarship documents the integration of occupational science content across courses in academic programs (Wood et al., 2000). Course integration has been successfully used in other content areas and academic disciplines, and general evidence supports course integration as a means of improving curricular design and student learning (Vidic 2 ̆ 6 Wietlauf, 2002). One particular course integration strategy—horizontal integration—involves fusing content across courses in a specific academic term. Integrating content via such strategies helps achieve the following four educational objectives, according to Case (1991) : (a) helping students deal with the world’s complexity; (b) overcoming students’ rigid perceptions of subject boundaries; (c) helping students respect and view knowledge as seamless; and (d) promoting efficiency in thinking and learning. Such educational objectives appear particularly relevant for occupational science education given the discipline’s interdisciplinary and complex nature. This paper presents the horizontal integration of Saint Louis University’s fall undergraduate <b>occupational</b> science <b>courses.</b> In their junior year, students in the Bachelors of Science in Occupational Science (BSOS) program take three <b>occupational</b> science <b>courses</b> per semester. These two semesters were designed in 2004 to impart basic terms and concepts, theoretical perspectives, and topics in occupational science. The fall semester courses in particular were initially conceptualized as covering distinct yet related aspects of the Person-Environment-Occupation model (Law et al., 1996), but the purpose and content of these <b>courses</b> shifted as <b>occupational</b> science developed. In light of the need {{to keep pace with the}} discipline’s advances, the authors used horizontal integration to restructure the fall semester <b>occupational</b> science <b>courses</b> in 2012. This paper compares and contrasts the presentation of occupation and related concepts in Saint Louis University’s fall <b>occupational</b> science <b>courses</b> pre-, post-, and one year following horizontal integration. Course descriptions, schedules, and assignments provide evidence of changes made consequent to horizontal integration. Faculty and student perspectives, which were gathered at multiple points before and after the integration, help frame the pros and cons of this educational strategy. Reflections on this horizontal integration process underscore the need for effective faculty collaboration to integrate content. Reflections also ground suggestions for future horizontal integration efforts. In addition, this paper identifies implications for occupational science education and the discipline’s development as a whole...|$|R

Groups were designed and implemented with trafficked youth in a transitional home. A program manual was provided for future artist training.
