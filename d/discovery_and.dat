5|$|In June 1903, {{supervised}} by Gabriel Lippmann, Curie was awarded her doctorate from the University of Paris. That month {{the couple were}} invited to the Royal Institution in London {{to give a speech}} on radioactivity; being a woman, she was prevented from speaking, and Pierre alone was allowed to. Meanwhile, a new industry began developing, based on radium. The Curies did not patent their <b>discovery</b> <b>and</b> benefited little from this increasingly profitable business.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, {{small amounts}} of {{rutherfordium}} were produced in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in the former Soviet Union and at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. The priority of the <b>discovery</b> <b>and</b> therefore the naming of the element was disputed between Soviet and American scientists, {{and it was not}} until 1997 that International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) established rutherfordium as the official name for the element.|$|E
5|$|In {{the short}} story The Harbor-Master, by Robert W. Chambers, the <b>discovery</b> <b>and</b> {{attempted}} recovery of the last known pair of great auks {{is central to the}} plot (which also involves a proto-H.P. Lovecraftian element of suspense). The story first appeared in Ainslee's Magazine (Aug 1889) and was slightly revised to become the first five chapters of Chambers' episodic novel In Search of the Unknown, (Harper and Brothers Publishers, New York, 1904).|$|E

5|$|It {{was known}} to Indigenous Australians before its <b>discovery</b> <b>and</b> naming by Europeans; for example, the Gunai people of Gippsland called it birrna. Because of its wide range {{it would have a}} name {{in a number of other}} {{indigenous}} languages, but these are now lost. In 2001, a search of historical archives for recorded indigenous names of Victorian flora and fauna failed to find a single name for the species.|$|E
5|$|Kincaid missed {{commencement}} exercises at the University of Washington due to {{his appointment}} as the entomologist attached to the Harriman Alaska Expedition. During that trip, completed before his 27th birthday, he collected about 8,000 specimens of insect, resulting in the <b>discovery</b> <b>and</b> naming of more than 240 new species, including Mesenchytraeus harrimani, which he named after the expedition's patron, E. H. Harriman.|$|E
5|$|Many drug {{molecules}} are enzyme inhibitors, {{so their}} <b>discovery</b> <b>and</b> improvement {{is an active}} area of research in biochemistry and pharmacology. A medicinal enzyme inhibitor is often judged by its specificity (its lack of binding to other proteins) and its potency (its dissociation constant, which indicates the concentration needed to inhibit the enzyme). A high specificity and potency ensure that a drug will have few side effects and thus low toxicity.|$|E

5|$|STS-125 was {{the only}} visit to the Hubble Space Telescope for Atlantis; the {{telescope}} had been previously serviced twice by <b>Discovery</b> <b>and</b> once each by Columbia and Endeavour.

5|$|The 18th and 19th century {{brought the}} <b>discovery</b> <b>and</b> {{production}} of synthetic green pigments and dyes, which rapidly replaced the earlier mineral and vegetable pigments and dyes. These new dyes were more stable and brilliant than the vegetable dyes, but some contained {{high levels of}} arsenic, and were eventually banned.|$|E
5|$|The Botanic Garden (1791) {{is a set}} of two poems, The Economy of Vegetation and The Loves of the Plants, by the British {{poet and}} naturalist Erasmus Darwin.

The more popular Loves of the Plants promotes, revises and illustrates Linnaeus's classification scheme for plants.|$|E

5|$|The Russian {{scientists}} {{proposed the}} name kurchatovium and the American scientists suggested the name rutherfordium {{for the new}} element.
