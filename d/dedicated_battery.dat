40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} {{the prevalence of}} topographical memory impairment following posterior cerebral artery infarctions (PCAI) and define its anatomical correlations. Methods: We recruited 15 patients (mean duration of 4 months postinfarct). We administered 2 sets of experimental tests to assess topographical memory: one set included 5 computerized tasks (CompT) and the other set consisted of one ecological topographical orientation test (EcolT) that included 4 tasks (i. e., map drawing, picture recognition and ordering, backward path). Fifteen healthy participants served as controls. Patients and controls underwent a volumetric T 1 MRI brain scan. Brain lesions in patients were segmented, normalized, and correlated with performance. Results: Topographical memory impairments were evidenced in patients with PCAI using both group and individual analyses (50 %), with more severe outcomes in patients with PCAI in the right hemisphere. CompT and EcolT were highly correlated, but the ecological test was more sensitive in revealing topographical memory impairments. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping demonstrated that 2 regions located in the cuneus and the calcarine sulcus correlated significantly with behavioral performance. Conclusions: Topographical memory disorders following PCAI are reported in 50 %of the patient population.

40|$|The Conventional {{sources of}} energy are rapidly depleting. Moreover the cost of energy is rising and {{therefore}} photovoltaic sy stem is a promising alternative. They are abundant, pollution free, distributed throughout the earth and recyclable. The hindrance factor is its high installation cost and low conversion efficiency. Therefore our aim {{is to increase the}} efficiency and power output of the system. It is also required that constant voltage is supplied to the load irrespective of the variation in solar irradiance and temperature. PV arrays consist of parallel and series combination of PV cells that are used to generate electrical power depe nding upon the atmospheric conditions (e. g. solar irradiation and temperature).

40|$|Different {{types of}} {{electric}} vehicles (EVs) have been recently designed {{with the aim}} of solving pollution problems caused by the emission of gasoline-powered engines. Environmental problems promote the adoption of new-generation electric vehicles for urban transportation. As it is well known, one of the weakest points of electric vehicles is the battery system. Vehicle autonomy and, therefore, accurate detection of battery state of charge (SoC) together with battery expected life, i. e., battery state of health, are among the major drawbacks that prevent the introduction of electric vehicles in the consumer market. The electric scooter may provide the most feasible opportunity among EVs. They may be a replacement product for the primary-use vehicle, especially in Eu- rope and Asia, provided that drive performance, safety, and cost issues are similar to actual engine scooters. The battery system choice is a crucial item, and thanks to an increasing emphasis on vehicle range and performance, the Li-ion battery could become a viable candidate. This paper deals with the design of a battery pack based on Li-ion technology for a prototype electric scooter with high performance and autonomy. The adopted battery system is composed of a suitable number of cells series connected, featuring a high voltage level. Therefore, cell equalization and monitoring need to be provided. Due to manufacturing asymmetries, charge and discharge cycles lead to cell unbalancing, reducing battery capacity and, depending on cell type, causing safety troubles or strongly limiting the storage capacity of the full pack.

Traditionally space batteries were composed of a single series connected string of cells.

40|$|Modern robots {{increase}} in complexity as new applications, e. g. cameras or navigation modules, {{are added to}} the system. These enhancements pose demanding operation conditions on the battery, emphasizing the importance of this component. Usually batteries represent an unpredictable source of power, whereas little or no knowledge about their characteristics or state is available. Methodologies to perform estimates of the remaining capacity may not be implemented. Equipment powered by the battery cannot determine if the battery, in its given state, is capable of supplying adequate power for an additional load. Even worse, the batteries may not be used correctly, e. g. due to wrong charging procedures or inadequate storage conditions at too high temperatures, what may result in damage or reduced performance. Under these suboptimal conditions it is often not possible to ensure the proper operation of the robot, this being unacceptable for security-critical applications.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of power management control strategies for a direct drive permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) based variable speed wind turbine (VSWT). Two modes of operation have been considered: (1) isolated/islanded mode, and (2) grid-connected mode. In the isolated/islanded mode, the system requires additional energy sources and sinks to counterbalance the intermittent nature of the wind. Thus, battery energy storage and photovoltaic (PV) systems have been integrated with the wind turbine to form a microgrid with hybrid energy sources. For the wind/battery hybrid system, several energy management and control issues have been addressed, such as DC link voltage stability, imbalanced power flow, and constraints of the battery state of charge (SOC). To ensure the integrity of the microgrid, and to increase its flexibility, dump loads and an emergency back-up AC source (can be a diesel generator set) have been used to protect the system against the excessive power production from the wind and PV systems, as well as the intermittent nature of wind source. A coordinated control strategy is proposed for the dump loads and back up AC source. An alternative control strategy is also proposed for a hybrid wind/battery system by eliminating the <b>dedicated</b> <b>battery</b> converter and the dump loads. To protect the battery against overcharging, an integrated control strategy is proposed. In addition, the dual vector voltage control (DVVC) is also developed to tackle the issues associated with unbalanced AC loads. To improve the performance of a DC microgrid consisting wind, battery, and PV, a distributed control strategy using DC link voltage (DLV) based control law is developed. This strategy provides simpler structure, less frequent mode transitions, and effective coordination among different sources without relying on real-time communication. In a grid-connected mode, this DC microgrid is connected to the grid through a single inverter at the point of common coupling (PCC). The generated wind power is only treated as a source at the DC side for the study of both unbalanced and balanced voltage sag issues at a distribution grid network. The proposed strategy consists of: (i) a vector current control with a feed-forward of the negative-sequence voltage (VCCF) to compensate for the negative sequence currents; and (ii) a power compensation factor (PCF) control for the VCCF to maintain the balanced power flow between the system and the grid. A sliding mode control strategy has also been developed to enhance the overall system performance. Appropriate grid code has been considered in this case. All the developed control strategies have been validated via extensive computer simulation with realistic system parameters. Furthermore, to valid developed control strategies in a realistic environment in real-time, a microgrid has been constructed using physical components: a wind turbine simulator (WTS), power electronic converters, simulated grid, sensors, real-time controllers and protection devices. All the control strategies developed in this system have been validated experimentally on this facility. In conclusion, several power management strategies and real-time control issues have been investigated for direct drive permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) based variable speed wind turbine system in an islanded and grid-connected mode. For the islanded mode, the focuses have been on microgrid control. While for the grid-connected mode, main consideration has been on the mitigation of voltage sags at the point of common coupling (PCC) ...|$|E

Moreover, the Foxtrot class {{was one of}} the last designs introduced before the adoption of the teardrop hull, which offered much better underwater performance. Also, although the Foxtrot was larger than a Zulu class submarine, the Foxtrot class had 2 of its 3 decks <b>dedicated</b> to <b>batteries.</b> This gave it an underwater endurance of 10 days, but the weight of the batteries made the Foxtrot's average speed a slow 2 knots at its maximum submerged time capability.

The Foxtrot class was completely obsolete by the time the last submarine was launched. The Russian Navy retired its last Foxtrots between 1995 and 2000, units were scrapped and disposed of for museum purposes.
