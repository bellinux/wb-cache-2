5|$|Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) is {{the second}} solo album by English {{musician}} Brian Eno. Produced by Eno, it was originally released by Island Records in November 1974. Unlike his previous album Here Come the Warm Jets, Eno used a core band of five instrumentalists (keyboards, guitars, bass, drums and percussion) and used fewer guest musicians. Also participating was guitarist and co-writer Phil Manzanera, who had played with Eno in Roxy Music. To <b>help</b> <b>guide</b> {{the production of the}} album, Eno and Peter Schmidt developed instruction cards called Oblique Strategies to use through the creative process of the album.|$|E
5|$|Two main {{clinical}} {{staging systems}} {{are used to}} classify HIV and HIV-related disease for surveillance purposes: the WHO disease staging system for HIV infection and disease, and the CDC classification system for HIV infection.

5|$|At 00:50, {{aircraft}} {{carrying the}} rest of the 6th Airborne Division appeared overhead and the paratroopers descended onto drop zones marked out by the pathfinders. Howard began blowing the morse code letter 'V' on his whistle, to <b>help</b> <b>guide</b> the 7th Parachute Battalion to the bridges. The first paratroops to arrive, at 00:52, were Brigadier Poett and the soldier he had picked up en route. Briefed by Howard on the situation, they heard tanks and lorries moving around in Bénouville and Le Port. On the drop zone, only about 100 men of the 7th Parachute Battalion had made it to the rallying point but all their signal equipment, machine guns and mortars were missing. Pine-Coffin, aware that his battalion was the only unit allocated defensive positions west of the bridges, decided they could not wait any longer and, at 01:10, left for the bridges.|$|E

In his second Test match he made an unbeaten 149 to <b>help</b> <b>guide</b> Australia to victory {{in a game that}} looked well beyond their reach. Australia were struggling at 5/126 in pursuit of 369 for victory as he joined his Western Australian teammate, Justin Langer, but the pair put on a record-breaking partnership of 238 to seal an Australian win. Gilchrist continued his strong run throughout his debut Test season, and ended the summer with 485 runs at 69.28 in six matches, three each against Pakistan and India, adding two fifties against the latter.|$|E

Over the next five hundred years, he becomes jaded and depressed, brooding on Serah's death and being weighed down by guilt at his inability to stop the world decaying. When Lightning meets up with him, his changed appearance and attitude makes her fear that he has gone insane. When they next meet, Snow reveals his intention to absorb a massive cloud of Chaos {{at the center of}} Yusnaan's palace, transform into a Cie'th and have Lightning kill him as a punishment for his failure.

5|$|Crazy Taxi and its sequels are score attack {{games that}} all employ the same {{fundamental}} rules and mechanics. The player controls {{one of several}} taxi drivers in a fictional city, looking for fares and then taking them to their destination in the fastest time possible. The player must perform this while time still remains on an overall gameplay clock. Passengers looking for rides are indicated by an overhead marker that is colored to represent the distance to their intended destination. The color marker ranges from red indicating short trips, to yellow for intermediate distances, and to green indicating long ones. When a passenger is picked up, the player is awarded additional time on the countdown time. Furthermore, a second countdown timer is started, representing how quickly the passenger needs to be at their destination. While a passenger is in the taxi, a large green arrow is shown on the player's HUD that points {{in the general direction}} of the passenger's destination to <b>help</b> <b>guide</b> the player through the map.|$|E

On 12 May, she left port to <b>help</b> <b>guide</b> a group of Navy Curtiss NC flying boats as they made the first aerial transatlantic crossing. The battleship was back in port by 31 May. She then took on a crew of midshipmen for a training cruise off the Chesapeake Bay and Virginia Capes. After finishing the cruise, Wyoming entered dry dock at the Norfolk Navy Yard on 1 July for a modernization for service in the Pacific. Her secondary battery was reduced to sixteen 5-inch guns. After emerging from the shipyard, she became the flagship of BatDiv 6 of the newly designated Pacific Fleet. On 19 July, Wyoming {{and the rest of}} the Pacific Fleet departed the east coast, bound for the Pacific. The ships transited the Panama Canal later that month, and reached San Diego, California on 6 August.|$|E
5|$|Realizing that Roberts {{needed more}} help if his racing career {{was going to}} progress, Aksland {{introduced}} Roberts to airline pilot and amateur motorcycle racer Jim Doyle, who would become Roberts' personal manager. In 1971, Doyle and Roberts approached Triumph's American distributor {{to ask about the}} possibility of a sponsored ride, but were told that Roberts was too small for one of their bikes. They then turned to the American Yamaha importer's team, who agreed to make Roberts a factory sponsored rider at the age of 19. Yamaha asked the head of their American racing program, former 250cc world champion Kel Carruthers to <b>help</b> <b>guide</b> Roberts' racing career. It marked the beginning of a long and productive relationship between the two men. Carruthers ended his riding career after the 1973 season to concentrate full-time on managing Roberts' and Yamaha's efforts in the A.M.A. Grand National Championship, a series which encompassed events in four distinctive dirt track disciplines plus road racing.|$|E

5|$|Severe acute {{withdrawal}} {{symptoms such as}} delirium tremens and seizures rarely occur after 1-week post cessation of alcohol. The acute withdrawal phase {{can be defined as}} lasting between one and three weeks. In the period of 3–6 weeks following cessation increased anxiety, depression, as well as sleep disturbance, is common; fatigue and tension can persist for up to 5 weeks as part of the post-acute withdrawal syndrome; about a quarter of alcoholics experience anxiety and depression for up to 2 years. These post-acute {{withdrawal symptoms}} have also been demonstrated in animal models of alcohol dependence and withdrawal. A kindling effect also occurs in alcoholics whereby each subsequent withdrawal syndrome is more severe than the previous withdrawal episode; this is due to neuroadaptations which occur as a result of periods of abstinence followed by re-exposure to alcohol. Individuals who have had multiple withdrawal episodes are more likely to develop seizures and experience more severe anxiety during withdrawal from alcohol than alcohol-dependent individuals without a history of past alcohol withdrawal episodes. The kindling effect leads to persistent functional changes in brain neural circuits as well as to gene expression. Kindling also results in the intensification of psychological symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. There are decision tools and questionnaires which <b>help</b> <b>guide</b> physicians in evaluating alcohol withdrawal. For example, the CIWA-Ar objectifies alcohol withdrawal symptoms in order to guide therapy decisions which allows for an efficient interview {{while at the same time}} retaining clinical usefulness, validity, and reliability, ensuring proper care for withdrawal patients, who can be in danger of death.|$|E
5|$|Two months later, Bridges joined Conference North side Kettering Town on {{a one-year}} deal. Bridges made his debut for Kettering in late August 2007, {{starting}} in the club's 3–2 away win against Worcester City. He scored his first goal for the club in the following game, scoring in the 60th minute to double Kettering's lead in a victory against Tamworth, and followed this up with another goal in the club's 4–1 win against Leigh RMI. Bridges made it four goals in as many games by scoring against both Boston United and Workington respectively. However, he suffered an injury in Kettering's 2–0 home loss to Hyde United in October 2007, ruling him out for two months. He returned to first-team action in December, coming on as a second-half substitute in the club's 3–2 loss against Cambridge City, and scored twice the following week in Kettering's 3–0 home win against Leigh RMI. He started 2008 by scoring Kettering's fifth in a 6–1 victory against Solihull Moors, as well as scoring in the next game – heading in Kettering's second in a 3–1 win against Harrogate Town. Bridges scored his ninth goal of the campaign shortly after, doubling the club's lead in a 2–0 away win at Hucknall Town. Bridges featured regularly during the club's {{second half of the}} season, getting on the scoresheet in a 3–0 away victory at Hyde United, before scoring Kettering's third in another 3–0 win, this time against AFC Telford United – his last appearance for the club.
