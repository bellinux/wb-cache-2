30|$|At {{the age of}} 62, {{the patient}} {{presented}} with <b>hyperthermic</b> <b>syndrome</b> associated with hyperleukocytosis (22, 000 /μl). A positron emission tomography scan revealed hyperfixation {{at the level of}} the superior pole of the left kidney and right cardiac ventricle. Cardiac echography was normal, and left adrenalectomy was performed. Histopathological examination did not evidence any neoplastic lesions, so immunohistochemical analysis was not carried out. The patient then received corticotherapy, and close follow-up was proposed. Two weeks later, she presented with dyspnea and distal cyanosis, and pulmonary scintigraphy showed bilateral embolism. Thoracic tomography revealed a mass inside the right atrium. Cardiac echography confirmed the presence of a 45 -mm mass growing from the right atrial wall and obtruding the superior vena cava.|$|E
40|$|The rather {{speculative}} {{report about}} a supposed case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) by Ahuja et al. (2010) demonstrates a common fault in psychiatric {{research that has}} considerable impact on the scientific value of many papers. I refer to the persistent disregard to the fundamentals of measurement methodology in science, {{which has been a}} particular problem in the psychiatric literature for many years. In hyperthermias, including NMS (if, indeed, NMS is a <b>hyperthermic</b> <b>syndrome)</b> the method and site of measure-ment is rarely even mentioned (so the accuracy cannot even be inferred). Since the seemingly ubiquitous aural temperature probes are unacceptably inaccurate, this is of some conse-quence (Hooper and Andrews, 2006). So, we are told ‘Soon after admission, she was febrile, with fluctuating hyperther-mia’. Nowhere in the paper does the notation C appear. Not only are we not told the temperature, but neither are we told how or where it was measured, how often, etc. And she was febrile and hyperthermic all in the same sentence? Hyperthermia (a much mis-used term) is, of course, not defined. It may be noted that most patients with NMS-related morbidity have never been hyperthermic to a physiologically injurious degree, i. e. > 39. 5 C (Lee, 2007; Spivak et al., 2000) and that the physiological range of ‘normal ’ core temperature in humans and other mammals ranges between 36 and 40 C. Needless to say, we cannot possibly know whether NMS is actually a <b>hyperthermic</b> <b>syndrome</b> because others do not measure temperature properly either (Gillman, 2010). This is a plea to editors and referees to keep the science in psychiatry: there is surreal irony in a paper where temperature is crucial to the considerations, but is not documented, specified or defined. Your readers might like to test themselves and see whether they can spot the other very similar measurement fault in the paper (the answer is below, after the references) ...|$|E
