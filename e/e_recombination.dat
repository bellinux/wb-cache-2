40|$|Abstract. The three {{mechanisms}} of crossover are transmission, assortment, and respect. Of these three mechanisms, assortment (i. <b>e.</b> <b>recombination)</b> is traditionally {{viewed as the}} primary feature and key advantage of crossover. However, respect (the preservation of common components) is also a feature that is unique to multi-parent operators like crossover – it takes two (or more) parents to have/identify common components. The effects of respect are isolated from all other aspects of genetic algorithms by using a parallel implementation of simulated annealing. In this implementation, the preservation of common components is used to focus the search process and this focus has improved the performance of simulated annealing on the TSP. Since only the mechanism of respect is transferred from genetic algorithms to simulated annealing, these experiments isolate and demonstrate the benefits of respect. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundThis study uses {{simulation}} {{to explore}} and quantify the potential effect of shifting recombination hotspots on genetic gain in livestock breeding programs. MethodsWe simulated three scenarios that differed in the locations of quantitative trait nucleotides (QTN) and recombination hotspots in the genome. In scenario 1, QTN were randomly distributed along the chromosomes and recombination was restricted to occur within specific genomic regions (i. <b>e.</b> <b>recombination</b> hotspots). In the other two scenarios, both QTN and recombination hotspots were located in specific regions, but differed in whether the QTN occurred outside of (scenario 2) or inside (scenario 3) recombination hotspots. We split each chromosome into 250, 500 or 1000 regions per chromosome of which 10 % were recombination hotspots and/or contained QTN. The breeding program was run for 21 generations of selection, after which recombination hotspot regions were kept the same or were shifted to adjacent regions for a further 80 generations of selection. We evaluated the effect of shifting recombination hotspots on genetic gain, genetic variance and genic variance. ResultsOur results show that shifting recombination hotspots reduced the decline of genetic and genic variance by releasing standing allelic variation {{in the form of}} new allele combinations. This in turn resulted in larger increases in genetic gain. However, the benefit of shifting recombination hotspots for increased genetic gain was only observed when QTN were initially outside recombination hotspots. If QTN were initially inside recombination hotspots then shifting them decreased genetic gain. DiscussionShifting recombination hotspots to regions of the genome where recombination had not occurred for 21 generations of selection (i. <b>e.</b> <b>recombination</b> deserts) released more of the standing allelic variation available in each generation and thus increased genetic gain. However, whether and how much increase in genetic gain was achieved by shifting recombination hotspots depended on the distribution of QTN in the genome, the number of recombination hotspots and whether QTN were initially inside or outside recombination hotspots. ConclusionsOur findings show future scope for targeted modification of recombination hotspots e. g. through changes in zinc-finger motifs of the PRDM 9 protein to increase genetic gain in production species...|$|E

Surprisingly, {{the magnitude of the}} suppression is quite similar to that at SPS. In order to establish whether these features arise due to the presence of a thermalized system of quarks and gluons formed {{in the course of the}} collision, one should investigate the impact of suppression mechanisms which do not explicitly involve such a state. We calculate shadowing for gluons in the Glauber-Gribov theory and propose a model invoking a rapidity-dependent absorptive mechanism motivated by energy-momentum conservation effects. Furthermore, final state suppression due to interaction with co-moving matter (hadronic or pre-hadronic) has been shown to describe data at SPS.

The solar cell characteristics are predicted by a simulation model that shows how the morphology influences device performance through integration of all the processes occurring in organic photocells in a specified morphology. In bicontinuous phases, the surface de. ning the interface between the electron and hole transporting phases divides the volume into two disjoint subvolumes. Exciton loss is reduced because the interface at which charge separation occurs permeates the device so excitons have only a short distance to reach the interface. As each of the component phases is connected, charges will be able to reach the electrodes more easily. In simulations of the current-voltage characteristics of organic cells with gyroid, disordered blend and vertical rod (rods normal to the electrodes) morphologies, we find that gyroids have a lower than anticipated performance advantage over disordered blends, and that vertical rods are superior. These results are explored thoroughly, with geminate recombination, i. <b>e.</b> <b>recombination</b> of charges originating from the same exciton, identified as the primary source of loss. Thus, if an appropriate materials choice could reduce geminate recombination, gyroids show great promise for future research and applications...|$|E

Eleven mating types were represented in the present study, including three pure breeds {{and a variety of}} F(1) and F(2) populations arising from regular and reciprocal crosses, respectively.

Estimates of heterosis and overdominance effects revealed significant heterosis effects for all the traits, but overdominance was only seen for larval duration (favorable effect) and survival rate (unfavorable effect). Maternal effects were significant {{for the majority of the}} traits under study. The results revealed significant reduction for all the quantitative traits from F(1) to F(2), except for larval duration.

Here, we take a genomic approach to compare sex chromosome differentiation in these three snake families. We identify homomorphic sex chromosomes in boas (Boidae), but completely heteromorphic sex chromosomes in both garter snakes (Colubridae) and pygmy rattlesnake (Viperidae). Detection of W-linked gametologs enables us to establish the presence of evolutionary strata on garter and pygmy rattlesnake sex chromosomes where recombination was abolished at different time points. Sequence analysis shows that all strata are shared between pygmy rattlesnake and garter snake, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>recombination</b> was abolished between the sex chromosomes before the two lineages diverged. The sex-biased transmission of the Z and its hemizygosity in females can impact patterns of molecular evolution, and we show that rates of evolution for Z-linked genes are increased relative to their pseudoautosomal homologs, both at synonymous and amino acid sites (even after controlling for mutational biases). This demonstrates that mutation rates are male-biased in snakes (male-driven evolution), but also supports faster-Z evolution due to differential selective effects on the Z. Finally, we perform a transcriptome analysis in boa and pygmy rattlesnake to establish baseline levels of sex-biase...|$|E
40|$|Electromagnetic {{thrusters}} typically use {{electric and}} magnetic fields to accelerate and exhaust plasma through {{interactions with the}} charged particles in the plasma. The energy required to create the plasma, i. e. ionization energy, is potential energy between the electron and ion. This potential energy is typically lost since it is not recovered as the plasma is exhausted and is known as frozen flow loss. If the frozen flow energy is {{a small fraction of}} the total plasma energy, this frozen flow loss may be negligible. However, if the frozen flow energy is a major fraction of the total plasma energy, this loss can severely reduce the energy efficiency of the thruster.

One neo gene contained a linker insertion mutation at the 5 ' end (neo minus), and the other contained a deletion and linker insertion at the 3 ' end (neo delta 3).

40|$|From the {{classical}} researches of Morgan and his school [1], the chromosome {{is known as}} a linear arrangement of hereditary elements, the "genes. " These elements must have an internal structure of their own. At this finer level, within the "gene" the question arises again: what is the arrangement of the sub-elements? Specifically, are they linked together in a linear order analogous to the higher level of integration of the genes in the chromosome? Until recently, the sensitivity of genetic analysis has been insufficient to answer this question. Mapping of a genetic structure is done by observing the recombination of its parts, and recombination involving parts of the structure that are very close together is a rare event. Observation of such rare events requires very many offspring and a selective trick for detecting the few individuals in which the event is recorded. It {{is for this reason that}} microorganism are the material of choice for studies of genetic fine structure, and have made it feasible to extend the fineness of genetic mapping by orders of magnitude. In favorable systems, the attainable resolution reaches the level of the molecular subunits of the hereditary material. and experimental testing of the linear arrangement of the finest structural details is therefore possible. A number of cases have been investigated on this level [2]. As a rule, closely linked mutations affecting the same characteristic can be seriated in an unambiguous way, suggesting a linear model. However, the "distances" (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>recombination</b> frequencies) between mutations are not always strictly additive, and certain complexities ("negative interference" effects [3, 4]) make quantitative analysis difficult. As pointed out by Muller [5] in regard to similar difficulties encountered in mapping on the chromosomal level, strict additivity of "distances" should not be taken as the criterion for the linear character of an array. A crucial examination of the question should be made from the point of view of topology, since it is a matter of how the parts of the structure are connected to each other, rather than of the distances between them. Experiments to explore the topology should ask qualitative questions (e. g., do two parts of the structure touch each other or not?) rather than quantitative ones (how far apart are they?). In what follows, such an investigation is attempted for a small portion of the genetic structure of a virus, the "rII" region of phage T 4. Using only qualitative tests, an examination is made of the topology of this structure at the molecular level...|$|E

[...] Bacterial conjugation has been extensively studied in Escherichia coli, but also occurs in other bacteria such as Mycobacterium smegmatis. Conjugation requires stable and extended contact between a donor and a recipient strain, is DNase resistant, and the transferred DNA is incorporated into the recipient chromosome by homologous <b>recombination.</b> <b>E.</b> coli conjugation is mediated by expression of plasmid genes, whereas mycobacterial conjugation is mediated by genes on the bacterial chromosome.|$|R

We have thus characterized 55 strains isolated one each from 55 human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients. There is considerable polymorphism among the strains. A population-genetic analysis indicates that the two fundamental consequences of sexual reproduction (i. <b>e.,</b> segregation and <b>recombination)</b> are apparently absent in this population of C. albicans. The population structure of C. albicans appears to be clonal, a state of affairs that has important medical and biological consequences...|$|R

Indeed, this fundamental biological process conditions the multiplication and the transmission of genes and thus the propagation of diseases in the environment. Reproductive strategies of protozoan parasites have been a subject of debate for many years, principally due to the difficulty in making direct observations of sexual reproduction (i. <b>e.</b> genetic <b>recombination).</b> Traditionally, these parasites were considered as characterized by a preeminent clonal structure. Nevertheless, with the development of elaborate culture experiments, population genetics and evolutionary and population genomics, several studies suggested that most of these pathogens were also characterized by constitutive genetic recombination events. In this opinion, we focused on Leishmania parasites, pathogens responsible of leishmaniases, a major public health issue. We first discuss the evolutionary advantages of a mixed mating reproductive strategy, then we review the evidence of genetic exchange, and finally we detail available tools to detect naturally occurring genetic recombination in Leishmania parasites and more generally in protozoan parasites...|$|R
