25|$|The main {{rivers that}} flow entirely inside Lebanon are the Litani river (average annual flow of 0.79 million cubic meter), the Ibrahim River (0.51), the Awali River and the Damour River (both 0.3). A {{large share of}} the Litani River is {{diverted}} through the Markaba tunnel for <b>hydropower</b> <b>generation</b> to the Awali River. Since the upper watershed of the Litani River is polluted and the Awali River is due to be tapped {{as a source of}} drinking water supply for Beirut, this water transfer has implications beyond its intended use for <b>hydropower</b> <b>generation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Upper {{watershed}} degradation, {{primarily in}} the form of soil erosion, has significant downstream effects. Erosion rates have been estimated at four times those of 1980. Across the DR sedimentation has reduced reservoir capacity by some 10-25 percent, with important economic effects for the hydropower industry (assuming a loss of <b>hydropower</b> <b>generation</b> of a mere 20 percent, the cost of dam siltation only in <b>hydropower</b> <b>generation</b> lost would exceed US$10 million per year). In addition, watershed degradation increases the costs of maintaining other water systems, such as irrigation channels and water supply infrastructure, and it affects coastal water quality. High turbidity from land-based sediments prevents reefs from forming in most of the Dominican coast.|$|E

According to 2002 data, energy supply is dominated by <b>hydropower</b> <b>generation</b> (51%), followed by crude oil (34%), wood (11%), biomass (3%) and natural gas (1%). Three hydropower plants on the Negro River and one binational plant with Argentina on the Uruguay River generate most of the hydropower in Uruguay (see above under water storage {{for a list of}} the dams). The possibility of building new plants is constrained by Uruguay’s geographic characteristics.|$|E

25|$|The {{electricity}} {{sector in}} Colombia {{is dominated by}} large <b>hydropower</b> <b>generation</b> (65%) and thermal generation (35%). Despite the country’s large potential in new renewable energy technologies (mainly wind, solar and biomass), this potential has been barely tapped. A 2001 law designed to promote alternative energies lacks certain key provisions to achieve this objective, such as feed-in tariffs, and has had little impact so far. Large hydropower and thermal plants dominate the current expansion plans. The construction of a transmission line with Panama, which will link Colombia with Central America, is underway.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, 72% of Peru's total {{electricity}} generation (27.4 TWh) came from hydroelectric plants, with conventional thermal plants only in operation during peak load periods or when hydroelectric output is curtailed by weather events. Hydropower accounts for 48% of total installed capacity. Non-consumptive water withdrawal for <b>hydropower</b> <b>generation</b> accounts for 11,138 million m3 per year. The largest hydroelectric {{facility in the}} country is the 900 MW Mantaro Complex in southern Peru, which is operated by state-owned Electroperu.

25|$|The Lake of the Ozarks, Pomme de Terre Lake, and Truman Lake in the {{northern}} Ozarks were formed by impounding the Osage River and its tributary the Pomme de Terre River in 1931, 1961 and 1979 respectively. Grand Lake in northeast Oklahoma was created in 1940. Stockton Lake was formed by damming the Sac River {{near the city of}} Stockton, Missouri in 1969 and supplements the water supply of Springfield in nearby Greene County.

30|$|Distributed small <b>hydropower</b> (DSH) <b>generation</b> systems {{connect to}} the grid through a {{synchronous}} generator, similar to the conventional hydropower plant. The main differences are more flexible construction and less impact on the ecological system. In addition, DSH’s capacity is much smaller, and normally lower than 1  MW. Practically, synchronous generators in DSH rarely operate in an under-excitation mode, but mostly in an over-excitation mode with a high-power factor. Therefore, the excitation control is generally in a constant power factor control mode [32], which means the DSH will simultaneously inject active and reactive power into the system. It is therefore recommended to be Type P-IQ.|$|R

However, it has brought about major changes to the environment and ecology of the Sacramento River, and met with controversy over its significant destruction of Native American tribal lands. In recent years, there has been debate over whether or not to raise the dam in order to allow for increased water storage and <b>hydropower</b> <b>generation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Peru {{contains}} roughly 71% of the world's tropical glaciers. Some of Peru's perennial rivers are fed by glaciers {{that are}} rapidly disappearing due to climate change. Since 1980 Peruvian glaciers have lost 22% of their surface area (500 km2), equivalent to 7,000 million {{cubic meters of}} water (about ten years of water supply for Lima). Glacier retreat in the Andes has important repercussions on Peru's water resources, including irrigation production and <b>hydropower</b> <b>generation.</b> This trend will continue, and {{it is believed that}} the increased runoff will cause Peru to suffer from severe water stress over the next 20 years.

40|$|Salient issues {{associated}} with the connection of <b>hydropower</b> distributed <b>generation</b> (HPDG) into distribution networks include operation and voltage regulation, grid connection and control interaction, anti-islanding protection and islanding operation, and operation of protective devices. Better understanding of these issues and finding solutions to these problems are timely and important to the electricity industry. This paper has addressed islanding and anti-islanding issues of hydropower DG, and developed design criteria and solution for effective operation and control. A current control scheme based on microprocessor-based line-tracking system is proposed for HPDG operation with grid system. A technique is developed to use islanding detection and anti-islanding protection of HPDG. The paper has also proposed guidelines for islanding operation of HPDG to improve quality and reliability of power supply. Control of over- and under-generated islanded systems with hydropower DG have been explored and criteria for islanding operation and resynchronisation when mains return are discussed...|$|R
25|$|Hydropower. An {{important}} use {{of water}} in Egypt is {{for the production of}} hydropower. This use is non-consumptive and is thus available for other uses further downstream. Hydropower plants exist at the Aswan High Dam (2100 MW), the old Aswan Dam (270 MW)and power plants at the Esna (90 MW) and Naga Hammadi weirs (64 MW). Together these plants accounted for 16% of installed electricity generation capacity in 2004.

The watershed is experiencing a warming trend, which is accompanied by earlier snowmelt and a general reduction in precipitation. A 2004 study showed that a 1–6percent decrease of precipitation would lead to runoff declining by as much as 18percent by 2050. Average reservoir storage declined by at least 32percent, further crippling the region's water supply and <b>hydropower</b> <b>generation.</b> A study by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 2008 predicted that both Lake Mead and Lake Powell stand an even chance of dropping to useless levels or [...] "dead pool" [...] by 2021 if current drying trends and water usage rates continue.|$|E

Both cases showed that the web of federal regulation is likely discouraging the development of micro-hydro in the United States by increasing the costs in time and funds for developers.
