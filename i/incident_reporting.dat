25|$|In 1996 ScotRail had {{initiated}} {{the creation of}} a rail safety group (later to become CIRAS) by a team from Strathclyde University. Other rail lines expressed interest in the project and several rail lines in Scotland voluntarily joined the system. Following the Ladbroke Grove rail crash, Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott mandated that all mainline rail in the UK come under the Confidential <b>Incident</b> <b>Reporting</b> & Analysis System (CIRAS) to involve every rail employee in the rail safety process. CIRAS now provides services to all rail workers and operating sectors throughout England, Scotland and Wales.|$|E
25|$|The APSF is a {{non-profit}} independent organisation founded in 1989 for anaesthesia error monitoring, and expanded to patient <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> and monitoring after {{results from the}} Quality in Australian Health Care Study (QAHCS) in 1995 prompted reaction from the public. Adverse medical events, both sentinel events (patient death and injury) and near misses (medical errors with potential harm), are reported and analyzed through its subsidiary, Patient Safety International (PSI), using a software tool, the Advanced Incident Management System (AIMS). AIMS is used in over half of Australia's hospitals, and was adopted in 2005 by the New Zealand Accident Compensation Corporation and the University of Miami Medical Group in Florida. Data remains confidential is protected from legal discovery under Australian Commonwealth Quality Assurance legislation. Patient safety information is provided by electronic newsletters.|$|E

2500|$|The Viet Cong [...] {{insurgency}} in South Vietnam {{brought to life}} the [...] "single largest and most comprehensive military counterinsurgency assessment apparatus {{in the history of}} warfare". It was run by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, MACV, [...] and the Central Intelligence Agency. [...] "Hundreds of thousands of military personnel, civilians, Vietnamese nationals, intelligence experts, and analysts" [...] collected and assessed the insurgency related information from 44 provinces, 257 districts, 2,464 villages, and 11,729 hamlets in South Vietnam to aid in decision making and charting the counterinsurgency strategy and tactics. The data was organized through catalogs and computer databases, such as, the Hamlet Evaluation System, the Terrorist <b>Incident</b> <b>Reporting</b> System, the Territorial Forces Effectiveness System, the Pacification Attitude Analysis System, the Situation Reports Army File, among others. Input metric varied from bars of soap distributed among the villagers to the [...] "body counts" [...] as a measure of the primary progress.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} model's {{potential to}} enter a deep stall was highlighted in the crash of Trident 1C G-ARPY on 3 June 1966 near Felthorpe in Norfolk during a test flight, {{with the loss of}} all four pilots on board. In this accident, the crew had deliberately switched off the stick shaker and stick pusher as required by the stall test schedule, and the probable cause was determined to be the crew's failure to take timely positive recovery action to counter an impending stall. The Confidential Human Factors <b>Incident</b> <b>Reporting</b> Programme (CHIRP), an experimental, voluntary, anonymous and informal system of reporting hazardous air events introduced within BEA in the late 1960s (and later adopted by the Civil Aviation Authority and NASA), brought to light two near-accidents, the [...] "Orly" [...] and [...] "Naples" [...] incidents: these involved flight crew error in the first case and suspicion of the Trident's control layout in the second.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patient safety {{incident}} (PSI) {{discovery is}} {{an essential component of}} quality improvement. When submitted, <b>incident</b> <b>reports</b> may provide valuable opportunities for PSI discovery. However, little objective information is available to date to quantify or demonstrate this value. The objective of this investigation was to assess how often Emergency Department (ED) <b>incident</b> <b>reports</b> submitted by different sources led to the discovery of PSIs. METHODS: A standardized peer review process was implemented to evaluate all <b>incident</b> <b>reports</b> submitted to the ED. Findings of the peer review analysis were recorded prospectively in a quality improvement database. A retrospective analysis of the quality improvement database was performed to calculate the PSI capture rates for <b>incident</b> <b>reports</b> submitted by different source groups. RESULTS: 363 <b>incident</b> <b>reports</b> were analyzed over a period of 18 months; 211 were submitted by healthcare providers (HCPs) and 126 by non-HCPs. PSIs were identified in 108 resulting in an overall capture rate of 31...|$|R

2500|$|Statistics on the {{reliability}} of <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> for injuries related to manipulation of the cervical spine vary. The RAND study assumed that only 1 in 10 cases would have been reported. However, Edzard Ernst surveyed neurologists in Britain for cases of serious neurological complications occurring within 24 hours of cervical spinal manipulation by various types of practitioners; 35 cases had been seen by the 24 neurologists who responded, {{but none of the}} cases had been reported. He concluded that under-reporting was close to 100%, rendering estimates [...] "nonsensical." [...] He therefore suggested that [...] "clinicians might tell their patients to adopt a cautious approach and avoid the type of spinal manipulation for which the risk seems greatest: forceful manipulation of the upper spine with a rotational element." [...] The NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination stated that the survey had methodological problems with data collection. Both NHS and Ernst noted that bias is a problem with the survey method of data collection.|$|E

Among witnesses to the alleged incident were a Government Minister, a TD, a senator and several journalists. One witness alleged Galvin called Callan a [...] "fucking cunt". Callan later described how Galvin approached him with [...] "his eyes bulging" [...] and looking [...] "crazy". The incident was investigated by the Garda Síochána. The media speculated on the reason behind the alleged <b>incident,</b> <b>reporting</b> that Callan had recently mimicked Galvin asking Taoiseach Enda Kenny to man-up by giving him a body-wax on radio.' and that Galvin had texted Callan before an appearance on The Saturday Night Show in relation to [...] "gay jibes" [...] the satirist had directed at him.

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 Task Management (TM) {{refers to}} the {{function}} in which the human operator manages his/her available sensory and mental resources in a dynamic, complex, safety-critical environment {{in order to accomplish}} the multiple tasks competing for a limited quantity of attention. There is {{reason to believe that the}} level of automation on the commercial aircraft flight deck may effect TM, however to date there has been little research that directly addresses this effect. Thus, the primary objective of this study was to begin evaluating the relationship between TM of commercial airline pilots and the level of automation on the flight deck by determining how automation affects the frequency of Task Prioritization errors as reported in Aviation Safety <b>Reporting</b> System (ASRS) <b>incident</b> <b>reports.</b> The secondary objective of this study was to create a methodology that modeled an effective way to use ASRS <b>incident</b> <b>report</b> data in an inferential analysis. Two samples of ASRS <b>incident</b> <b>reports</b> were compared. The first sample was composed of 210 <b>incident</b> <b>reports</b> submitted by pilots flying advanced technology aircraft and the second sample was composed of 210 <b>incident</b> <b>reports</b> submitted by pilots flying traditional technology aircraft. To help avoid confounding effects, the two samples were further divided into three sub-samples each made up of 70 reports submitted during a specified time period: 1988 - 1989, 1990 - 1991, and 1992 - 1993. Each <b>incident</b> <b>report</b> was analyzed using an incident analysis form designed specifically for this study. This form allowed the analyst to classify the <b>incident</b> <b>report</b> as either containing a Task Prioritization error or not based on the narrative of the <b>report.</b> Twenty-eight <b>incident</b> <b>reports</b> from the advanced technology sample and 15 from the traditional technology sample were classified as containing Task Prioritization errors.
