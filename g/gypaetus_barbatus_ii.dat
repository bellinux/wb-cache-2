50|$|The {{bearded vulture}} (<b>Gypaetus</b> <b>barbatus),</b> {{also known as}} the {{lammergeier}} or ossifrage, is a bird of prey and {{the only member of the}} genus Gypaetus. Traditionally considered an Old World vulture, it actually forms a minor lineage of Accipitridae together with the Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), its closest living relative. It is not much more closely related to the Old World vultures proper than to, for example, hawks, and differs from the former by its feathered neck. Although dissimilar, the Egyptian and bearded vulture each have a lozenge-shaped tail — unusual among birds of prey. In July 2014, the IUCN Red List has reassessed this species to be near threatened. Before July 2014, it was actually classed as Least Concern. Their population trend is decreasing.|$|R
50|$|The {{long-tailed marmot}} is diurnal and feeds on plant material. It is most {{active in the}} morning when about forty percent of the time is spent foraging. After {{emerging}} from the burrow, the marmots spread out and do not forage as a group. Food is either collected from the ground by the mouth or plucked from taller plants. Between bouts of foraging, a marmot sometimes stands on its back legs and surveys its surroundings. Group members communicate with each other, emitting complex alarm calls when predators are spotted. They also react to the alarm calls of neighbouring groups. Predators of the long-tailed marmot include the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), the grey wolf (Canis lupus), the snow leopard (Panthera uncia), the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) and possibly the bearded vulture (<b>Gypaetus</b> <b>barbatus).</b>|$|R
40|$|Reintroduced bearded {{vultures}} <b>Gypaetus</b> <b>barbatus</b> in the Alps descend {{mainly from}} birds {{collected in the}} former Soviet Union. A second project has been initiated in southern Spain using the same bloodlines. We used DNA fingerprinting to assess levels of genetic variability, and to determine genetic differences, among birds from the Pyrenees and birds from the Alps reintroduction project. The degree of fingerprint band-sharing was high within both populations, which points to low levels of genetic variation in each population. On the other hand, common fingerprint fragments occurred at markedly different proportions in each population, suggesting some degree of population differentiation. Interbreeding would increase genetic variability in the resulting populations. We thus recommend the incorporation of wild Pyrenean birds to both the Alps and the Spanish breeding projects. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Bearded Vulture <b>Gypaetus</b> <b>barbatus</b> {{is a large}} raptor that accumulates bones at its nest. The {{latter is}} often in a cave large enough to {{accommodate}} humans. With the aim of creating a modern reference, the bone contents from 11 nests of modern Corsi-can Bearded Vulture are analysed from a taphonomic point of view. They are mainly char-acterised by overwhelming quantities of third phalanges from middle-size ruminants, abundance signs of digestion around the proximal articulations, and a few bone flakes. Bone flakes on the other hand, are very abundant at bone breaking areas or ossuaries (rocky slopes) used by the Bearded Vulture. Both types of accumulation are compared in this paper {{in order to understand the}} feeding behaviour of this raptor and its consequences to the formation of archaeological assemblages. The authors then compared these new, present-day reference data with the Late glacial faunal assemblages of Luri-Grìtulu cav...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{concern about the}} impact of veterinary drugs and livestock pathogens as factors damaging wildlife health, especially of threatened avian scavengers feeding upon medicated livestock carcasses. We conducted a comprehensive study of failed eggs and dead nestlings in bearded vultures (<b>Gypaetus</b> <b>barbatus)</b> to attempt to elucidate the proximate causes of breeding failure behind the recent decline in productivity in the Spanish Pyrenees. We found high concentrations of multiple veterinary drugs, primarily fluoroquinolones, in most failed eggs and nestlings, associated with multiple internal organ damage and livestock pathogens causing disease, especially septicaemia by swine pathogens and infectious bursal disease. The combined impact of drugs and disease as stochastic factors may result in potentially devastating effects exacerbating an already high risk of extinction and should be considered in current conservation programs for bearded vultures and other scavenger species, especially in regards to dangerous veterinary drugs and highly pathogenic poultry viruses...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The Bearded Vulture (<b>Gypaetus</b> <b>Barbatus)</b> is an {{endangered}} species in Europe that feeds almost exclusively on bone remains provided by wild and domestic ungulates. In [1], we presented a P system in order to study the evolution of these species in the Pyrenees (NE Spain). Here, we present a new model that overcomes some limitations of the previous work incorporating other scavenger species (predatory) and additional prey species that provide food for the scavenger intraguild and interact with the Bearded Vulture in the ecosystem. After the validation, the new model can be {{a useful tool for}} the study of the evolution and management of the ecosystem. P systems provide a high level computational modelling framework which integrates the structural and dynamical aspects of ecosystems in a compressive and relevant way. The inherent randomness and uncertainty in ecosystems is captured by using probabilistic strategies. ...|$|R

40|$|The karyotypes of most birds {{consist of}} {{a small number of}} macrochromosomes and {{numerous}} microchromosomes. Intriguingly, most accipitrids which include hawks, eagles, kites, and Old World vultures (Falconiformes) show a sharp contrast to this basic avian karyotype. They exhibit strikingly few microchromosomes and appear to have been drastically restructured during evolution. Chromosome paints specific to the chicken (GGA) macrochromosomes 1 - 10 were hybridized to metaphase spreads of three species of Old World vultures (Gyps rueppelli, Gyps fulvus, <b>Gypaetus</b> <b>barbatus).</b> Paints of GGA chromosomes 6 - 10 hybridize only to single chromosomes or large chromosome segments, illustrating the existence of high chromosome homology. In contrast, paints of the large macrochromosomes 1 - 5 show split hybridization signals on the chromosomes of the accipitrids, disclosing excessive chromosome rearrangements which is in clear contrast to the high degree of chromosome conservation substantiated from comparative chromosome painting in other birds.

40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al International {{symposium}} on lead poisoning, celebrado el 28 de septiembre de 2015 en Annecy (Francia). Birds of prey, especially obligatory and occasional scavengers, {{are at high}} risk of lead poisoning when they feed on carcasses or prey with embedded lead ammunition in their flesh. Although in many cases, the lead shot or bullet fragments are regurgitated with undigested material such as hair and feathers in the form of pellets, the absorption of lead during food digestion can be enough to kill the raptors. Cases of lead poisoning by shot or bullet ingestion have been described in at least 14 species of diurnal birds of prey and three species of nocturnal raptors in Europe, some of which have endangered or near-threatened populations, such as the White-tailed Eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), the Spanish Imperial Eagle (Aquila adalberti) or the Bearded vulture (<b>Gypaetus</b> <b>barbatus).</b> In the case of the White-tailed Eagle, lead poisoning has been identified as the cause of mortality in 25...|$|R
50|$|The {{bird species}} in Mongolia include several {{that are very}} large; six species of cranes present account for half the numbers in the world. There are 22 {{endangered}} species of birds including hawks, falcons, buzzards, cranes and owls. Though cranes are not hunted for superstitious reasons, they are still threatened due to habitat degradation and only 5000 breeding pairs are reported, mostly in Dornod’s Mongol Duguur Strictly Protected Area. In eastern Mongolia, a critically endangered species of crane is the white naped crane (Tsen togoru). Overall there are 469 species of birds, including species which are also domesticated and linked to the wild ancestral species. Of these, 330 species are migratory and 119 are seen in Mongolia throughout the year. Species identified include: golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), lammergeyer (<b>Gypaetus</b> <b>barbatus),</b> spoonbills (Platalea leucorodia), Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus), great white egrets (Egretta alba), whooper swans (Cygnus cygnus), great black-headed gulls (Larus ichthyatus), black storks (Ciconia nigra), swan goose (Anser cygnoides) and snowcock (Tetraogallus altaicus) or Altain ular.|$|R
50|$|Most accipitrids will {{supplement}} their diet with non-putrid carrion but, of course, none specialized with {{this as well}} as the 14-16 species of vultures, which have evolved very large bodies (which leave them equipped to fill their crop with carrion), weaker, less specialized feet relative to other accipitrids, large wingspans to spend extensively periods of time in flight over openings scanning for carcasses and complex social behavior in order to establish a mixed species hierarchy at carrion. The New World vultures have attained several similar characteristics, but only through convergent evolution and are seemingly not directly related to Old World vultures and other accipitrids. The lammergeier (<b>Gypaetus</b> <b>barbatus)</b> is an aberrant cousin of the Old World vultures that has maintained strong feet in order to carry and drop large bones in order to crack them open to feed on bone marrow, their primary food, a technique they also sometimes use for live prey items, like tortoises.|$|R
50|$|The fauna of the {{national}} park is also rich. There are about 800 species of beetles as well as numerous species of reptiles (Viper - Vipera lebetina, Armenian and Dahl lizards - Darevskia armeniaca, D. dahli etc.), amphibians (lake frog - Rana ridibunda, green toad - Bufo viridis etc.), fish (trout - Salmo fario, barbel or Kura beghlou- Barbus lacertacyri etc.). Birds are also abundant represented by 150 species including black grouse (Tetrao mlokosievicsi), golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), bearded eagle (<b>Gypaetus</b> <b>barbatus</b> aureus), Caspian snowcock (Tetraogallus caspius) and others. Over 40 species of mammals are registered in {{the national}} park such as red deer (Cervus elaphus), brown bear (Ursus arctos), fox (Vulpes vulpes), lynx (Lynx), wolf (Canis lupus), wild boar (Sus scrofa), wild cat (Felis silvestris), roe (Capreolus capreolus), badger (Meles meles), squirrel (Sciurus anomalus) and others. Dilijan National Park {{is important for the}} conservation of forest landscapes, recreation and health protection purposes, as well as economic activities due to the presence of favorable conditions.|$|R
50|$|A taphonomic survey {{concluded}} distinct {{types of}} large animal bone accumulations by different agents. Red deer (Cervus elaphus) and bovine fossils with butchery marks are extremely abundant while carnivore marks are rare. No deer bone is digested while {{nearly half of}} the bones show human interference. Neanderthals account for most of the deer and the bovines and a sizable portion of the chamois and ibex fossils, some of them were secondly scavenged by carnivores.. The survey also allows to favor the hypothesis of extraction by Neanderthals of the fat contained in the spongy tissues of deer bones. In chamois assemblages, 482 fossils were investigated and the non-human predation marks interpreted. Bearded vultures (<b>Gypaetus</b> <b>barbatus),</b> that must have occupied the site during Neanderthal's absence accumulated a high percentage of the chamois bones and to a lower degree those of ibex. Dhole (Cuon alpinus) teeth and bones are the most numerous among carnivores. Milk teeth suggest that Cuon alpinus sheltered its offspring at the site. A 2013 study concluded that dholes contributed to the present composition of animal fossils, to which extent remains debated.|$|R
40|$|Reintroductions are a {{valuable}} tool to reestablish locally extirpated species. A difficult decision facing all reintroduction projects is when to stop further releases, both from a demographic and genetic view point. Here we address this question {{in the case of}} the reintroduction of bearded vultures (<b>Gypaetus</b> <b>barbatus)</b> in the Alps, which were exterminated in the early 20 th century mainly due to human hunting. To investigate the genetic diversity present in today’s reintroduced Alpine bearded vulture population, we reconstructed a pedigree, spanning the entire reintroduction program since the beginning of the captive breeding (1973 - 2010). We found that not every founder bird was equally well represented in the wild population and that founder genome equivalents were low (13). Moreover, wildborn bearded vultures showed a relatively high mean inbreeding coefficient compared to the captive birds and the effective population size was estimated to be only 28. Overall, this suggests that there is not enough genetic diversity in the wild Alpine bearded vulture population to ensure its longterm sustainability. Therefore further releases are recommended...|$|R
40|$|Given {{the still}} scanty {{amount of data}} ascribable to the {{interaction}} between raptors and hominins, this contribution aims to fuel {{the debate on the}} complexity of Neanderthal behavior during MIS 3 in Western Eurasia. Nowadays, large raptors in general are scarce in nature, due to being top consumers in the trophic chain, and attracted hominins possibly as advantageous indicators of scavenging and feeding opportunities. Nevertheless, a symbolic rather than alimentary significance was designed from several taphonomic investigations, demonstrating various deliberate actions for removing wings, feathers and talons from raptors of different sizes. Following the results of taphonomic examinations of four raptors' (cf. Aegypius monachus, cf. <b>Gypaetus</b> <b>barbatus,</b> Clanga clanga and Falco columbarius) bones recovered from layer A 9 at Fumane Cave, Italy, the data produced are here compared and supported by experimental butchering and contextualized within a wider context that ranges into the Early Upper Palaeolithic. Comparable to previous examples from Fumane and from other sites, the traces impressed {{on the surface of the}} wing bones suggest the recovery of the feathers or the wing tip adorned of the primary feathers, but also more complex and insisted interventions aimed to prepare the bone for a possible functional use...|$|R

Aims To determine the current status and long-term population trend of an isolated breeding population of Bearded Vultures <b>Gypaetus</b> <b>barbatus</b> (Corsica, Mediterranean). Methods The total Bearded Vulture population was monitored between 1981 and 2008. Results The current effective breeding {{population size}} of Bearded Vultures in Corsica is ten pairs/trios with a slight increase of one to two pairs since 1983. The population is currently estimated at 25 individuals. Breeding parameters (laying rate, breeding success and productivity) have decreased significantly over the full 28 -year study period, although the decrease was not significant when the data set was restricted to 1988 - 2008. A mean of 60. 3 % (n = 204) of pairs have laid, but this proportion is highly variable between years. Productivity has been very low (0. 16 young/pair/year, n = 233). Breeding parameters of the Corsican population of Bearded Vultures are very low {{compared with those of}} other western European populations in the Pyrenees.

40|$|The {{removal of}} eggs or chicks from wild populations to create captive populations, {{reinforce}} free-ranging populations or reintroduce species {{into the wild}} is a restoration tool that requires an assessment of potential detrimental effects upon the donor population. This is an absolute prerequisite when wild donor populations are scarce and small. Here, we forecast the population trend of the largest European population of the bearded vulture (<b>Gypaetus</b> <b>barbatus)</b> over the next 30 years under different demographic and management scenarios (removal of eggs, chicks or fledglings). Projections derived from {{the combination of a}} PDP model (Population Dynamic P-system) and a Box-Behnken design would lead to a decline in 77 % of all 57 scenarios analysed. Among the 13 scenarios predicting a population increase, only 4 seem realistic in terms of growth rate (0. 04 %– 1. 01 %), at least if current age at first breeding and productivity would remain constant over time. Our simulations thus suggest that most extraction scenarios would have detrimental effects on the demography of the donor population. Release of captive-born young or removal of only the second hatched chick for subsequent captive rearing and translocation into the wild appear to represent much better supplementation and reintroduction options in this threatened species...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of many conservation programs {{is to increase}} population size by improving a species' survival and reproduction. However, density dependence of demographic parameters may confound this approach. In this study we used a 25 -year data set on Bearded Vultures (<b>Gypaetus</b> <b>barbatus)</b> in Spain to evaluate the consequences of population growth on reproductive performance. Unlike its coefficient of variation (CV), mean annual productivity decreased with increasing population size. After controlling for territorial heterogeneity, productivity also was negatively related to {{the distance to the}} nearest conspecific breeding pair and to supplementary feeding points where floaters congregate. These results suggest that vulture populations are regulated as posited by the site-dependency hypothesis: as the population increases, average productivity decreases because progressively poorer territories are used. The combined effects of the shrinkage of territories and the presence of floaters around supplementary feeding points seem to be the main causes of productivity decline and are therefore the main determinants of territory quality. This has conservation implications, especially concerning the role of supplementary feeding points. Supplementary feeding should be reviewed given that its usefulness in reducing preadult mortality has not yet been proved and its effect on productivity, as our results suggest, is negative. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.
