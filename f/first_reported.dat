A survey found that about 5% of workers in plants manufacturing fluorescent lamps in 1949 in the United States had beryllium-related lung diseases. Chronic berylliosis resembles sarcoidosis in many respects, and the differential diagnosis is often difficult. It killed some early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as Herbert L. Anderson.|$|E

A field study of Scandinavian specimens found vanadium contents ranging from 38 to 169mg of vanadium per kg of dry mushroom (average of 119mg/kg).
