25|$|Close {{air support}} was {{provided}} {{in the form of}} the dive bomber and medium bomber. They would support the focal point of attack from the air. German successes are closely related to the extent to which the German Luftwaffe was able to control the air war in early campaigns in Western and Central Europe, and the Soviet Union. However, the Luftwaffe was a broadly based force with no constricting central doctrine, other than its resources should be used generally to support national strategy. It was flexible and it was able to carry out both operational-tactical, and strategic bombing. Flexibility was the Luftwaffe's strength in 1939–1941. Paradoxically, from that period onward it became its weakness. While Allied Air Forces were tied to the support of the Army, the Luftwaffe deployed its resources in a more general, operational way. It switched from air superiority missions, to medium-range interdiction, to strategic strikes, to close support duties depending on the need of the ground forces. In fact, <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>it</b> being a specialist panzer spearhead arm, fewer than 15 percent of the Luftwaffe was intended for close support of the army in 1939.|$|E

2500|$|Mandel {{replied to}} such criticisms in his 1978 essay [...] "Marxism and the crisis", where he argued this {{dichotomy}} {{does not make}} sense, because {{it is based on}} a false social ontology. Overproduction and overaccumulation were, he argued, inseparable phenomena, and surplus value could not be realized as profit income unless output was sold; consequently the average rate of profit and the rate of market expansion mutually determined each other. He maintained that falling profits were only one factor in the recurrent sequence from boom to slump. He argued that the basic reason why capitalist crises occurred is that capitalism is a system of production run by competing producers, based on private property. In this system, [...] "what is rational {{from the standpoint of the}} system as a whole is not rational from the standpoint of each great firm taken separately, and vice versa." [...] According to Mandel, that also explained why bourgeois macroeconomics and microeconomics contained quite different principles and concepts of economic behaviour (in contrast to Marx's economics, where macro and micro share the same concepts). Thus, in every branch of economic activity, capitalist business could never escape from recurrent problems of overinvestment and underinvestment, which periodically culminated in general crises. Following György Lukács, Mandel portrays capitalist rationality as a [...] "contradictory combination of partial rationality and overall irrationality." [...] It is not that competing businessmen are [...] "irrational", <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>it,</b> but that their own [...] "instrumental rationality" [...] and [...] "value rationality" [...] (in a Weberian sense) differ from the functional logic of capitalism as a system, and therefore the two run into serious conflicts at times - leading to crises.|$|E
