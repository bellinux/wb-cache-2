The antioxidant activity of T. indica {{was determined by}} evaluating 1, 1 -Diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity, ferric reducing power assay (FRAP) and ascorbic acid equivalent content (AAC). The tested sample showed appreciable amounts of total phenolic contents (51. 45 - 71. 68 mg GAE/gm of dry extract), DPPH scavenging capacity (61. 18 - 71. 17 %), IC 50 values (98. 30 - 248. 60), reducing power (0. 6377 - 0. 7702) and total antioxidant capacity (22. 75 - 43. 80 AAE/gm) at different solvents and techniques.

30|$|Nevertheless, the {{critical}} transition in sample temperature from cold-quenching to <b>hot</b> <b>extraction</b> conditions deserves closer attention. This transition, which {{has rarely been}} addressed in literature so far, was identified by Zakhartsev et al. (2015) as sensitive spot for uncontrolled reactivation of enzymatic activity which in consequence can cause falsely estimated metabolite levels. While Zakhartsev et al. (2015) recommended this transition to occur in sub-second scale, {{it is apparent that}} this cannot be achieved with existing cold-filtration methods: There is inevitably {{a short period of time}} in the range of a few seconds which are necessary to transfer the mycelial filter cake into the <b>hot</b> <b>extraction</b> solution (e.g. Douma et al. 2010; present work Additional file 2 : Movie S 1). Whether or not the transition to <b>hot</b> <b>extraction</b> conditions is fast enough to avoid enzymatic reactivation, can only be indirectly assessed by parameters like the EC. A too slow metabolic quenching or an ineffective halt of enzymatic activity would have caused a drop in EC (Faijes et al. 2007; Ganzera et al. 2006). Thus the high EC values achieved in this study hint that neither the time needed for this transfer or the shift in temperature were critical in this respect. This is supported by other studies where similar high EC values were achieved from samples treated with cold stops followed by heat extraction (e.g. Nasution et al. 2006). However, this might not apply to other metabolic reactions and thus certainly necessitates further investigations.|$|E

30|$|To {{develop and}} improve the FiltRes-principle we used a series of {{independent}} glucose-limited chemostat cultures. This highly standardized cultivation conditions provided a reproducible homogenous sample material in terms of constant morphology and biomass concentrations or physiology, which facilitated a general assessment of the FiltRes-device’s performance. The following parameters were monitored for this work and will be elaborated in more detail in the next sections: (1) the filtration time, {{because it is the}} main determinant for the total contact time to the quenching solution; (2) the filtration performance of various sample types; (3) the intracellular nucleotide concentrations over a range of independent cultivations to assess the reproducibility of the FiltRes-principle; (4) the temperature profile, because cold stop techniques do not irreversibly damage enzymes. Thus special attention has to be given during the subsequent sample processing steps like the transition to the <b>hot</b> <b>extraction</b> conditions to avoid an unintended reactivation of metabolic activities (Zakhartsev et al. 2015). This holds especially true for metabolites with a fast turnover such as nucleotides.

Initially, different extraction solvents and methods were applied to dried, ground bark which made possible the preparation of extracts having both significant lethality to brine shrimp larvae (Artemia franciscana Leach) as well as antioxidant activity in vitro based on tests involving reactions with 2, 2,-diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH).

The pulp sample was 40 g dry weight of {{and the effect of}} the extraction temperature and sodium hydroxide concentration after two hours of extraction on the viscosity, yield and R 18 values of the pulp were examined. The viscosity and R 18 values after the extraction process were found to increase as the temperature and sodium hydroxide concentration increased while the yield was found to be reduced. Also, it was found that at 600 C and 800 C an increase in sodium hydroxide charge had a low influence on the yield and viscosity compared to the influence at 1000 C and 1200 C. An increase in Sodium hydroxide charge from 35 to 120 kg/ton of pulp had a higher influence on the R 18 value than the temperature effect going from 600 C to 1200 C; hence alkaline charge was a more important parameter controlling the purification during <b>hot</b> alkaline <b>extraction.</b> The result also shows a correlation between yield loss and purification; an increase in the degree of purification gives a lower yield because of the degradation of the hemicelluloses.

30|$|Approximately 5  mL culture broth was sprayed rapidly {{into the}} 25  mL precooled {{quenching}} solution, vortexed and instantaneous weighed {{to estimate the}} exact volume of the sample. The resulting mixture was then immediately transferred into the FiltRes-device for filtration (vacuum already applied, slide bar in opened position). After the filtration was finished, the slide bar was closed. To test the influence of washing steps, the mycelial filter cake was then additionally washed 1 – 3 times with 25  mL cold (− 40  °C) quenching solution. Afterwards, the extraction solution was injected as follows. The septa of the injection port were pierced with the canule of the dispenser and 16.5  mL of <b>hot</b> <b>extraction</b> solution was rapidly injected. The injection of the extraction solution from below the filter net forced the mycelial filter cake to completely detach from the nylon filter net (detached filter cake see Fig.  4). This exchange of the quenching and extraction solutions was performed within a few seconds as illustrated in Additional file 2 : Movie S 1, where {{the handling of the}} FiltRes-device was demonstrated with a preculture mycelium. In the next step, the FiltRes-device was tilted to transfer the extraction broth into pre-weighed polypropylene or polycarbonate tube with screw caps (50  mL, Nalgene, UK; preheated in a water bath at 90  °C). Due to the device’s dead-volume (extraction solution below the filter), some of the injected extraction solution (1 – 2  mL) could not be transferred into the extraction tubes. This proportion of extraction solution, however, never came into direct contact with the mycelial cake as it remained below the filter disk. Even if metabolites had diffused into this dead volume, the determined intracellular metabolite concentration would have been only minimally distorted. This shortcoming will be eliminated in future prototypes. In any case, to guarantee similar volumetric extraction conditions, the volume transferred from the FiltRes-device to the preheated test tube was determined by weighing and, if necessary, compensated with <b>hot</b> <b>extraction</b> solution. Afterwards, the samples were placed into a shaking water bath at 90  °C and extracted as described later. Since these extracts were subsequently evaporated and resuspended in a defined volume of buffer, the compensation with <b>hot</b> <b>extraction</b> solution had no dilution effect.
