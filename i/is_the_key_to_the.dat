25|$|The {{strategic}} importance {{of nuclear weapons}} is a major reason why the technology of nuclear fission is politically sensitive.

25|$|And this {{contradictory}} {{nature of}} media, is in turn {{due to the}} ways that media are mediated in modern-day culture: “In short, mass-mediated products are determined by various factors—the systems of ownership, the process of cultural production, the level of struggle, the state of consciousness in society at a given time, and so on. A dialectical method of analysis would involve studying all these factors within a concrete historical context so as to explain the multiple mediations that infuse a product of culture” (85). For many of these new thinkers, the very way that new forms of media are mediated by social actors, or way that these actors navigate the complex and contradictory forces of history, the material world, and culture through media <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> age old problem of mediation in Marxist theory.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{research}} of Jacques Boucher de Perthes has highlighted an occupation of the site of Abbeville (Menchecourt-les-Abbeville quarter) from the Acheulean era, one must imagine the place in Roman times as a succession of marshes, similar to marsh of Saint-Gilles which remains today. Further to the north, the entire plateau between the Authie and the Somme was covered in primary forest. The Romans had to break through this forest massif for {{the passage of the}} road from Amiens to the village of Ponches on the one hand, and on the other to the west by the road linking the Beauvaisis in Boulogne-sur-Mer. The couple Abbeville / Saint-Valery-sur-Somme <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> historical enigma of the landing of Magnus Maximus and his Britto-Roman troops in the spring of 383 AD (St-Valery = Leuconos > Pors Liogan; Abbeville = Talence > Tolente). The road to Paris passes near the Vieux-Rouen-sur-Bresle, which has been identified with the character Himbaldus (Château-Hubault).|$|E
25|$|An imprisoned Billy then meets Juan Mendoza, {{for whom}} the bandits work. He reveals he is Billy's father. He {{explains}} Marisa was his woman, but she left him for Thomas McCall, and that the medallion she took from him <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> location of the Gold of Juarez. He sent his men to Hope {{to get it from}} her, but when they found she didn't have it, they killed her and Thomas. Billy explains he lost the medallion in the river, but Mendoza doesn't believe him, and sends him into the desert, giving him one hour to find the gold, or he will kill Molly. Using his memory of the shape of the medallion and his mother's story, Billy is able to locate the Gold in a hidden underground passage. However, Mendoza has followed him, and attempts to kill him. Billy flees, and is rescued by Ray, who tells him to get to safety as he returns to Mendoza's alcazar to rescue Molly. Ray then reveals his own backstory; he and Thomas were running cattle over the Mexican border when they met Marisa. They both fell in love with her, although she was Mendoza's woman, and she chose Thomas over Ray. They fled to the caverns in which the Gold was hidden, but Ray tracked them. There, he confronted Thomas. Their younger brother, William, a priest, attempted to intervene, but Ray killed him. On that day, Ray renounced violence and embraced God. Believing the gold to be cursed, he, Marisa and Thomas agreed to leave it behind and seal the cavern.|$|E

500|$|The first actors cast in {{the pilot}} were Kirk Acevedo and Mark Valley in mid January 2008. John Noble and Lance Reddick were next to be cast, {{although}} it was incorrectly believed that Tomas Arana had been cast in Reddick's role. This {{was followed by the}} casting of Anna Torv, Blair Brown and Jasika Nicole. Abrams said that Torv was cast because she was a combination of [...] "sophistication, great talent, amazing looks and a complexity that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> character being an interesting central character". Kurtzman felt that she was someone [...] "you want to spend time with", which was critical to a series about science. Joshua Jackson was the last series regular to be cast. Jackson auditioned for the role of James T. Kirk in Abrams' Star Trek and believed this is what impressed the producer to cast him in his television project. According to Abrams, Jackson's casting was [...] "very last minute".|$|E
500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 975 feet long, {{was released}} on September 6, 1910. [...] The film was distributed by the Motion Picture Distributing and Sales Company. Once the film was released, it was sometimes listed ambiguously for other productions bearing the same name. One ambiguous listing, most likely for the Thanhouser film, {{was made by the}} Crystal Theatre in Hutchinson, Kansas. Known theaters advertising the film, unambiguously, are noted in Indiana and Arizona. A reviewer of The Moving Picture World wrote, [...] " [...] little domestic tragedy which shows how boys are sometimes driven from home and what results from it. ... It is a picture that goes direct to the heart and makes one put himself in the place of all the characters. Perhaps that magic word, mother, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> whole situation." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror took issue with the depiction of the step father's violent abuse of the young son and found the melodrama to be one [...] "with an ending that appeals to the sympathies".|$|E

500|$|Nathalie Cox as Juno Eclipse— Rogue Shadow’s {{pilot and}} Starkiller's love interest. Eclipse was not {{originally}} {{part of the}} game; early concepts had the apprentice as an older character who develops a connection with a young Princess Leia. Star Wars creator George Lucas, uncomfortable with this idea, encouraged the developers to create a love interest. The apprentice, who has had limited interaction with women when the game begins, does not at first know how to act around her. Her introduction {{early in the game}} allows the relationship with Starkiller to develop, and her inclusion helps [...] "recapture that rich ensemble feel of the original Star Wars". According to Sean Williams, who wrote the novelization, the romantic storyline <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Force Unleashed. The name [...] "Juno Eclipse" [...] was originally proposed as a name for the character eventually called [...] "Asajj Ventress"— it was rejected for Ventress as insufficiently villainous. The Force Unleashed project lead Haden Blackman brought the name back for the mythic quality of the name [...] "Juno" [...] and the duality suggested by an [...] "eclipse." [...] Cox, in addition to strongly resembling the character's concept art, had [...] "integrity and poise" [...] appropriate to Juno Eclipse that helped the actor secure the role.|$|E
