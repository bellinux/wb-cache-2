40|$|Subjective {{well-being}} (SWB) in {{aging is}} important not only {{as an indicator of}} positive aging, but also because of its effects on relevant outcomes for the person (e. g., health) and the community (e. g., involvements). This raises the question of how SWB of older people can be improved through interventions. Our contribution focusses on three domains for improving SWB: Optimization of resources (<b>e.</b> g., <b>financial</b> <b>situation,</b> autonomy), help with critical life events (e. g., widowhood, disablement), and support at the end of life. We consider reasons for optimizing SWB in these areas as well as the theoretical and empirical foundation for interventions. Among them are (1) bottom-up approaches regarding the link between domain-specific SWB (e. g., regarding health, <b>financial</b> <b>situation,</b> social relationships) and global SWB, (2) Coping approaches to critical life events frequently occuring in old age (e. g., widowhood, disablement) and (3) research on terminal decline of SWB. Against this background principal possibilities of optimizing SWB in these domains are delineated and both individual and societal (e. g., communal, national) level interventions are described...|$|R
40|$|While anecdotal {{evidence}} indicates financial advice affects consumers’ financial well-being, this research project {{is motivated by}} the absence of empirically-grounded research relating to the extent to which, and, importantly, how, financial planning advice contributes to broader client well-being. Accordingly, the aim of this project is to establish how the quality of financial planning advice can be optimised to add value, not only to clients’ <b>financial</b> <b>situation,</b> but also to broader aspects of their well-being. This broader construct of well-being captures a range of process and outcome factors that map to concepts of security, control, choice, mastery, and life satisfaction (Irving, 2012; Gallery, Gallery, Irving & Newton, 2011; Irving, Gallery, and Gallery, 2009). Financial planning is commonly purported to confer not only tangible benefits, but also intangible benefits, such as increased security and peace of mind that are considered as important, if not more important, than material outcomes. Such claims are intuitively appealing; however, little empirical evidence exists for the notion that engaging with a financial planner or adviser promotes peace of mind, feelings of security, and expands choices and possibilities. Nor is there evidence signalling what mechanisms might underpin such client benefits. In addressing this issue, we examine the financial planning advice (including financial product advice) provided to retail clients, and consider the short- and longer-term impacts on clients’ financial satisfaction and broader well-being. To this end, we examine both process (<b>e.</b> g., how <b>financial</b> planning advice is given) and outcome (<b>e.</b> g., <b>financial</b> <b>situation)</b> effects...|$|R
40|$|Part 1 : Research DirectionsInternational audienceCurrent {{economic}} conditions press governments worldwide {{to develop more}} efficient policies with significantly lower budgets. A possible way to achieve this is by exploiting online social networks. The tremendous impact of social networks in everyday life (<b>e.</b> g. obesity, <b>financial</b> <b>situation,</b> smoking etc.) is now well established in the literature. However, up to now, the impact of online social networks in policy making has not been thoroughly investigated. We claim that policies, {{in addition to their}} traditional aims, should also aim to improve the online connections of target population as this will enable more targeted thus more efficient and effective policy making. In this paper, we present this idea, relate it to traditional policy making lifecycles, and investigate relevant technological aspects. We anticipate this work will contribute to the on-going discussion on {{the pros and cons of}} exploiting online social networks in policy making...|$|R

40|$|The article {{considers}} {{the impact of}} financial pyramids on a man’s well-being {{in terms of the}} key domains: <b>financial</b> <b>situation,</b> social environment, education, employment, and health. The authors determinate the financial pyramid as a scheme of interaction of the organizer and participants. In a financial pyramid participants' contributions are not a source of investments and it is redistributed between them. It is important to understand that the participants of a financial pyramid are able to lose contributions. The major negative effects of financial pyramids on socio-economical and psychological wellbeing of a man and society in Russia were revealed. We detected their effect on: 1) a <b>financial</b> <b>situation,</b> i. <b>e.</b> <b>financial</b> losses of participants of financial pyramids; 2) man’s psycho-emotional state; 3) decision-making of various social groups, i. e. intensification of their cognitive distortions. An instrument of social and economic policies of Russia aimed at mitigating negative effects of financial pyramids was suggested and described. The instrument will enable to enhance confidence of population in financial institutions and their services...|$|R
40|$|Subjective {{well-being}} (SWB) {{in later}} life is important not just {{as an indicator of}} life quality, of mental health and of successful aging of older people, but also because of its effects on individually or socially relevant outcomes (e. g. health, social engagement). This raises the question {{about the extent to which}} and under what conditions SWB of older people can be improved by social policy measures (SPM). Our presentation examines theoretical and empirical issues related to answering this question. A first theoretical topic considers the relevance of bottom-up vs. top-down approaches conceptualizing the link between domain-specific satisfaction (e. g., with health, <b>financial</b> <b>situation,</b> social relationships) and global life satisfaction in old age. A second issue concerns the theoretical status of SWB in causal networks, i. e., SWB as consequence, as cause, as mediator and as moderator variable. A third topic refers to what can be derived from different theoretical approaches to SWB about whether and when SPM should have an effect of SWB {{in later life}}. Following that several empirical questions with respect to improving SWB of older people through SPM are considered. First, we discuss whether the present level of SWB in older adults (or subgroups thereof) indicates a demand for improving SWB. Second, we look at the importance of SWB for individually and socially desirable outcomes (e. g., on health, community involvement) by providing specific evidence which can provide further reasons for improving SWB through SPM. Third, we examine which life circumstances (<b>e.</b> g., <b>financial</b> <b>situation,</b> functional status), life events (e. g., becoming disabled) and individual activities (e. g., volunteering) are known to be significantly related to SWB and which of these conditions could principally be improved through SPM. Fourth, we discuss existing and needed empirical evidence for the effects of local, regional, national SPM on SWB in later life. We emphasize that past research has already produced an impressive body of knowledge relevant for improving SWB in older people through SPM, but that further theoretical and empirical efforts are needed to provide such SPM with a richer foundation. We conclude that better strategies for communicating results of research about SWB to policy makers should be elaborated so that these can have more impact on policy decisions about SPM...|$|R
