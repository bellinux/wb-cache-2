40|$|Ireland is {{the most}} trade {{dependent}} country in the European Union. As a peripheral island economy, an effective seaport system is essential to link into international trade and facilitate export-led development. During the 1980 s, the growth in maritime trade was dispersed to benefit most of Ireland's ports, although more recently traffic has polarised strongly on the ports of Cork, Dublin, Rosslare, the Shannon Estuary and Waterford. Four processes have played key roles in changing the comparative advantages of Irish ports and stimulating trade: <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> to Northern Ireland ports; Europeanisation and globalisation; industrial policy and economic restructuring; peripherality and transport policy. National Development Plans have used structural funds to reduce the costs of peripherality and have focused investment on four strategic national ports which service two corridors <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> across the Irish Sea. A new context for port management has been created under the 1996 Harbours Act. Copyright Royal Dutch Geographical Society 2000. ...|$|R
50|$|Convective cells {{may develop}} in the {{vicinity}} of troughs and give birth to a tropical cyclone. Some tropical or subtropical regions such as the Philippines or south China are greatly affected by convection cells along a trough. In the mid-latitude westerlies, troughs and ridges often alternate, especially when upper-level winds are in a high-amplitude pattern. For a trough in the westerlies, the region just west of the trough axis is typically an area of convergent winds and descending air - and hence high pressure - while the region just east of the trough axis is an area of fast, divergent winds and low pressure. Tropical waves are a type of trough in easterly currents, a cyclonic northward <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trade</b> winds.|$|R

We estimate an empirical model <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> <b>deflection</b> and <b>trade</b> depression <b>of</b> roughly 5100 commodities exported by China to 37 countries between 1992 and 2001.

Studies have shown that before the sliping of 4 # CFRP sling, the <b>deflection</b> growth <b>of</b> east and west tie-beam, east and west arch both has good symmetry. The <b>deflection</b> growth <b>of</b> crossbeams and decks also has good symmetry, but after the sliping of 4 # CFRP sling(located at the middle of west tie-beam), the structural internal forces redistribution appeared. The <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> west tie-beam increased suddenly, and the mid-span <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> west tie-beam is larger than that of east tie-beam by 14. 6 %. The mid-span <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> east arch is larger than that of west arch by 9. 9 %. The <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> crossbeam at 3 L/ 8 and L/ 4 sections are respectively larger than those of crossbeam at 5 L/ 8 and 3 L/ 4 sections by 13. 8 % and 5. 3 %, The <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> 3 #, 2 # and 1 # decks are respectively larger than those of 4 #, 5 # and 6 # decks by 7. 8 %, 13. 2 % and 17. 1 %. After the snapping of 10 # CFRP sling(located at 3 L/ 8 section of east tie-beam), the structural internal forces would appear redistribution.

The <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> the biggest cantilever of the rigid frame bridge is the controlled target, and the optimizing design of the Sutong bridge is conducted. A meaningful result is obtained, and it provides a basis of the choice of the height of beams. The long-term <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> the midspan of a bridge using the large-span cantilever construction At present, the problem <b>of</b> too large <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> a large-span rigid frame bridge of prestressed concretes has become a common disease[1, 2].

The characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> main beams display as the long-term growth; the growth rate may be accelerating, reducing and keeping the trend of uniform change. Thus, the structural long-term deflection is far larger to the value of design calculation. There are many bridges of this problem, and now let us list some, as follows...|$|R
