5|$|The {{lower jaw}} is rather robust. It is also {{straight}} in top view, without much expansion at the <b>jaw</b> <b>tip,</b> suggesting the lower jaws as a pair, the mandibula, were narrow.

5|$|Various {{distinguishing}} {{traits of}} the lower jaw have been established. The longitudinal groove on the outer surface of the dentary is wide. The third tooth socket of the dentary is not enlarged.

There is a boss present on the lower outer side of the ischium shaft with a rough surface. The underside of the second sacral vertebra has an angular longitudinal keel. A ridge on the upper side of the third metatarsal connected to a groove in the side of the second metatarsal. The middle of the front edge of the scapula forms a thin crest.|$|E
50|$|The {{possible}} species Coloborhynchus capito {{represents the}} second largest known ornithocheirid (after a Tropeognathus specimen), and indeed the largest toothed pterosaur known. A referred specimen from the Cambridge Greensand of England described in 2011 consists {{of a very large}} upper <b>jaw</b> <b>tip</b> which displays the tooth characteristics that distinguish C. capito from other species. The <b>jaw</b> <b>tip</b> is nearly 10 cm tall and 5.6 cm wide, with teeth up to 1.3 cm in base diameter. If the proportions of this specimen were consistent with other known species of Coloborhynchus, the total skull length could have been up to 75 cm, leading to an estimated wingspan of 7 m. However, this species may belong to a different genus.|$|E
5000|$|O. simus is {{only known}} from fragmentary <b>jaw</b> <b>tips.</b> It bore a {{distinctive}} convex [...] "keeled" [...] crest on its snout. Ornithocheirus had relatively narrow <b>jaw</b> <b>tips</b> compared to Anhanguera and Coloborhynchus, which had prominently-expanded rosettes of teeth. Also unlike related pterosaurs, {{the teeth of}} Ornithocheirus were mostly vertical, rather than set at an outward-pointing angle.|$|R
50|$|Some Tupandactylus {{specimens}} preserve {{evidence of}} a keratinous beak at the <b>jaw</b> <b>tips.</b> However, this was restricted to the crested portion of the lower jaw, as one specimen also preserves pycnofibres (simple feather-like filaments) covering the jaws further back.|$|R
50|$|The jaws of Nyctosaurus {{were long}} and {{extremely}} pointed. The <b>jaw</b> <b>tips</b> were thin and needle sharp, and are often broken off in fossil specimens, giving the appearance that one jaw is longer than the other, though in life they were probably equal in length.|$|R
50|$|The skulls {{of adult}} Pterodactylus {{were long and}} thin with about 90 narrow, conical teeth. The teeth {{extended}} back from the tips of both jaws, and became smaller {{farther away from the}} jaw tips (unlike some relatives, where teeth were absent in the upper <b>jaw</b> <b>tip</b> and were relatively uniform in size). The teeth extended farther back into the jaw than in close relatives, as some were present below the front of the nasoantorbital fenestra, the largest opening in the skull. Unlike related species, the skull and jaws were straight, not curved upwards.|$|E
50|$|Although Buriolestes superficially {{resembles the}} predatory {{theropod}} dinosaurs, with jaws lined by finely serrated and slightly curved teeth well-adapted to a carnivorous diet, it {{in fact is}} an early member of the otherwise-herbivorous Sauropodomorpha, the group {{that gave rise to}} the giant sauropods. Characteristically sauropodomorph traits seen in Buriolestes include a downturned <b>jaw</b> <b>tip</b> and a long deltopectoral crest on the humerus. However, Buriolestes also lacks a small head and enlarged nostrils, which are typical among sauropodomorphs, and the medial condyle on the end of its tibia projects backwards, a distinctive feature (autapomorphy) unique to this animal.|$|E
50|$|Using the {{referred}} specimens as a guide, A. araripensis {{has been}} described as similar in skull anatomy to species referred both to Anhanguera and Coloborhynchus, and the species is placed in either of these genera by various researchers. Like species referred to Coloborhynchus, the snout tip was blunt and bore two forward-projecting teeth that emerged higher on the jaw {{than the rest of the}} tooth row. As in most other ornithocheirids, the species bore a large, rounded crest at the tip of the jaws. Like Coloborhynchus species and unlike the type species of Anhanguera, the crest emerged from the very tip of the blunted jaws, rather than further back on the jaw. However, unlike Coloborhynchus, A. araripensis lacked a dent or depression in the blunted <b>jaw</b> <b>tip,</b> and the teeth appear to have been smaller and more uniform in size.|$|E
5|$|Most {{pterosaur}} skulls had elongated jaws with a {{full complement}} of needle-like teeth. In some cases, fossilized keratinous beak tissue has been preserved, though in toothed forms, the beak is small and restricted to the <b>jaw</b> <b>tips</b> and does not involve the teeth. Some advanced beaked forms were toothless, such as the pteranodonts and azhdarchids, and had larger, more extensive, and more bird-like beaks.|$|R
50|$|Gallodactylidae is a {{group of}} pterosaurs within the {{suborder}} Pterodactyloidea.Gallodactylids differed from other related pterosaurs in several distinct features, including fewer than 50 teeth present only in the <b>jaw</b> <b>tips,</b> and rounded crests present on the rear portion of the skull and jaws but not near the ends of their snouts. At least some species possessed jaw flanges, possibly used to bissect hard-shelled prey.|$|R
50|$|The {{males of}} this species seem to engage in fights like most other mesoplodonts. Scars from {{fighting}} are present on this species, although the precise mechanism of combat is enigmatic: given the teeth's position near the lower <b>jaw</b> <b>tips,</b> it can be expected that the scars consist of two parallel lines; only single scar lines were present on the adult male, however, suggesting glancing blows rather than direct attacks created them.|$|R
5000|$|Tupandactylus imperator {{is known}} from four nearly {{complete}} skulls. The holotype specimen is MCT 1622-R, a skull and partial lower jaw, {{found in the}} Crato Formation, dating to the boundary of the Aptian-Albian stages of the early Cretaceous period, about 112 Ma ago. It was initially described as a species of Tapejara, but later research has indicated it warrants its own genus. The skull was toothless and had a prominent sagittal crest, only the base of which was bony: {{the front of the}} crest featured a tall bony rod extending up and back, and the rear of the crest had a long prong of bone projecting behind it. The bulk of the crest was made up of soft tissue similar to keratin, supported by the two bony struts. An additional skull described in 2011, specimen CPCA 3590, preserved more of the lower jaw, showing that like Tapejara, T. imperator had a large, asymmetrical [...] "keel"-like crest {{on the underside of the}} lower <b>jaw</b> <b>tip.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Tapejarids {{were small}} to {{medium-sized}} pterosaurs with several unique, shared characteristics, mainly {{relating to the}} skull. Most tapejarids possessed a bony crest arising from the snout (formed mostly by the premaxillary bones of the upper <b>jaw</b> <b>tip).</b> In some species, this bony crest {{is known to have}} supported an even larger crest of softer, fibrous tissue that extends back along the skull. Tapejarids are also characterized by their large nasoantorbital fenestra, the main opening in the skull in front of the eyes, which spans at least half the length of the entire skull in this family. Their eye sockets were small and pear-shaped. Studies of tapejarid brain cases show that they had extremely good vision, more so than in other pterosaur groups, and probably relied nearly exclusively on vision when hunting or interacting with other members of their species. Tapejarids had unusually reduced shoulder girdles that would have been slung low on the torso, resulting in wings that protruded from near the belly rather than near the back, a [...] "bottom decker" [...] arrangement reminiscent of some planes.|$|E
50|$|Various {{distinguishing}} {{traits of}} the lower jaw have been established. The longitudinal groove on the outer surface of the dentary is wide. The third tooth socket of the dentary is not enlarged.

Benson also concluded it would be most parsimonious {{to assume that the}} Stonesfield Slate material represents a single species.

The low vertical ridge on the outer side of the ilium, above the hip joint, shows parallel vertical grooves. The bony skirts between the shafts of the ischia are thick and touch each other forming an almost flat surface. There is a boss present on the lower outer side of the ischium shaft with a rough surface. The underside of the second sacral vertebra has an angular longitudinal keel. A ridge on the upper side of the third metatarsal connected to a groove in the side of the second metatarsal. The middle of the front edge of the scapula forms a thin crest.|$|E
5000|$|More recently, however, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that this placodont was an aquatic herbivore, scraping off vegetation from the bottom with its broad jaws. This suggestion has been brought up in a paper discussing the habits and morphology of Atopodentatus, another Mesozoic aquatic reptile formerly suggested to be a filter-feeder and bearing strongly convergent jaw adaptations, including a similar [...] "hammerhead" [...] <b>jaw</b> <b>tips,</b> though unlike Atopodentatus it's still believed that Henodus relied on filter feeding to obtain plant-matter from the substrates.|$|R
50|$|The skulls of Aerodactylus {{were long}} and narrow with about 64 teeth which were more crowded towards the <b>jaw</b> <b>tips.</b> The teeth {{extended}} back from the <b>tips</b> of both <b>jaws,</b> and the tooth row ended before {{the front of the}} nasoantorbital fenestra, the largest opening in the skull. Unlike some related species, the skull and upper jaw was curved slightly upward, not straight. A small, hooked beak was present in the very <b>tips</b> of the <b>jaws,</b> with both upper and lower hook no larger than the teeth that surrounded them.|$|R
5000|$|A. araripensis {{was a large}} species {{originally}} {{based on}} BSP 1982 I 89, known as the [...] "Munich specimen", fossil remains including a partial skull (missing {{the end of the}} jaws) and arms; the preserved skull section had no evidence of a crest. A more complete skull, catalogue number MN 4735-V, has been referred to the species and has shed light on the anatomy of the <b>jaw</b> <b>tips,</b> important in ornithocheirid classification. An additional referred specimen, known as the [...] "St. Gallen specimen" [...] (SAO 16494), consists of a nearly complete skull.|$|R
5000|$|G. cristatus {{is based}} on {{specimen}} BSP 1892.IV.1, from the Solnhofen limestone of Eichstätt, Germany. It was originally described by Plieninger in 1901 as a specimen of Pterodactylus kochi, and was given its current specific name by Carl Wiman in 1925, meaning [...] "crested" [...] in Latin. Yang Zhongjian determined that it deserved its own genus in 1964. Second species G. ramphastinus (in 1858 accidentally revised to rhamphastinus by Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer) was named as a distinct species long before G. cristatus, described by Johann Andreas Wagner in 1851 as a species of the now deprecated genus Ornithocephalus. The specific name refers to the toucan, ramphastinos in Greek. It {{is based on}} specimen BSP AS.I.745, a skeleton from the slightly younger Mörnsheimer Limestone of Daiting, Germany. Peter Wellnhofer added it to Germanodactylus in 1970, although Maisch and his coauthors have suggested that it deserves its own genus, [...] "Daitingopterus". David M. Unwin has also referred miscellaneous limb bones and vertebrae from the somewhat older Kimmeridge Clay of Dorset, England to the genus; these finds at the time marked the earliest appearance of short-tailed pterosaurs in the fossil record.Bennett suggested in 1996 that Germanodactylus represented adults of Pterodactylus, but this has been rejected by further studies, including his own. Bennett's 2006 reappraisal of Germanodactylus found both species to be valid and included within the genus, with G. cristatus known from four specimens including two juveniles, and G. rhamphastinus from two specimens. The genus differs from other pterosaurs {{by a combination of}} characteristics including a sharply pointed <b>jaw</b> <b>tip,</b> 4-5 premaxillary teeth and 8-12 maxillary teeth per side of the upper jaw, robust maxillary teeth that, unlike in Pterodactylus, are not reduced in size farther from the tip of the jaw, a naso-antorbital fenestra twice the length of the eye socket, and various proportional differences. G. cristatus differs from G. rhampastinus by having no teeth in the tip of the jaw and fewer teeth (~13 in each side of the upper jaw and ~12 in the lower versus 16 upper and 15 lower on each side for G. rhamphastinus).|$|E
50|$|The {{skull of}} Megalosaurus is poorly known. The {{discovered}} skull elements are generally rather large {{in relation to}} the rest of the material. This can either be coincidental or indicate that Megalosaurus had an uncommonly large head. The praemaxilla is not known, making it impossible to determine whether the snout profile was curved or rectangular. A rather stubby snout is suggested by the fact that the front branch of the maxilla was short. In the depression around the antorbital fenestra to the front, a smaller non-piercing hollowing can be seen that is probably homologous to the fenestra maxillaris. The maxilla bears thirteen teeth. The teeth are relatively large, with a crown length up to seven centimetres. The teeth are supported from behind by tall, triangular, unfused interdental plates. The cutting edges bear eighteen to twenty denticula per centimetre. The tooth formula is probably 4, 13-14/13-14. The jugal bone is pneumatised, pierced by a large foramen from the direction of the antorbital fenestra. It was probably hollowed out by an outgrowth of an air sac in the nasal bone. Such a level of pneumatisation of the jugal is not known from other megalosaurids and might represent a separate autapomorphy. The lower jaw is rather robust. It is also straight in top view, without much expansion at the <b>jaw</b> <b>tip,</b> suggesting the lower jaws as a pair, the mandibula, were narrow. Several traits in 2008 identified as autapomorphies, later transpired to have been the result of damage. However, a unique combination of traits is present in the wide longitudinal groove on the outer side (shared with Torvosaurus), the small third dentary tooth and a vascular channel, below the row of interdental plates, that only is closed from the fifth tooth position onwards. The number of dentary teeth was probably thirteen or fourteen, though the preserved damaged specimens show at most eleven tooth sockets. The interdental plates have smooth inner sides, whereas those of the maxilla are vertically grooved; the same combination is shown by Piatnitzkysaurus. The surangular has no bony shelf, or even ridge, on its outer side. There is laterally an oval opening present in front of the jaw joint, a foramen surangulare posterior, but a second foramen surangulare anterior to the front of it is lacking.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. – Occidozyga semipalmata {{is found}} to be unique based on the fl attened fi nger and toe tips that lack circum-marginal grooves and in having a tongue with rounded tip. Another form, O. tompotika new species, is found at Mount Tompotika, Eastern Peninsula of Sulawesi, appears to be closely related to species from the Wallacean region and the Philippines. This is a medium sized species, toes and fi ngers with larger fl attened tips lacking a circum-marginal groove and more {{extensive}} toe webbing compared to O. semipalmata. However these two species, together with O. fl oresiana, are retained within the genus and not assigned to Ingerana because they have most characters allied to the genus, especially by the lack of external tympanum and having a single bony protuberance at the lower <b>jaw</b> <b>tip...</b>|$|E
5000|$|Juvenile Rhamphorhynchus had {{relatively}} short skulls with large eyes, and the toothless beak-like <b>tips</b> of the <b>jaws</b> were shorter in juveniles than adults, with rounded, blunt lower <b>jaw</b> <b>tips</b> eventually becoming slender and pointed as the animals grew. Adult Rhamphorhynchus {{also developed a}} strong upward [...] "hook" [...] {{at the end of}} the lower jaw. The number of teeth remained constant from juvenile to adult, though the teeth became {{relatively short}}er and stockier as the animals grew, possibly to accommodate larger and more powerful prey. The pelvic and pectoral girdles fused as the animals aged, with full pectoral fusion attained by one year of age.|$|R
50|$|Like {{other species}} {{assigned}} to the genus Coloborhynchus, C. spielbergi bore large, rounded crests {{at the ends of}} expanded upper and lower jaws. However, rather than being robust and box-shaped as in many Coloborhynchus species, the <b>jaw</b> <b>tips</b> were more slender and spoon-shaped, and the crest is thin from top to bottom, both features commonly seen in species typically referred to Anhanguera, a genus in which C. speilbergi is classified by some researchers (as A. spielbergi). As in other ornithocheirids, the size and orientation of the teeth vary considerably along the jawline. In C. spielbergi, the tooth pattern has been described as more similar to that of Tropeognathus robustus than to Anhanguera piscator.|$|R
50|$|Shonisaurus {{had a long}} snout, and its {{flippers}} {{were much}} longer and narrower than in other ichthyosaurs. While Shonisaurus was initially reported to have had socketed teeth (rather than teeth set in a groove as in more advanced forms), these were present only at the <b>jaw</b> <b>tips,</b> and only in the very smallest, juvenile specimens. All of these features suggest that Shonisaurus may be a relatively specialised offshoot of the main ichthyosaur evolutionary line. It was historically depicted with a rather rotund body, but studies of its body shape since the early 1990s {{have shown that the}} body was much more slender than traditionally thought. S. popularis had a relatively deep body compared with related marine reptiles.|$|R
40|$|Placoderms are {{a diverse}} group of {{armoured}} fishes that dominated the aquatic ecosystems of the Devonian Period, 415 – 360  million years ago. The bladed jaws of predators such as Dunkleosteus suggest that these animals were the first vertebrates to use rapid mouth opening and a powerful bite to capture and fragment evasive prey items prior to ingestion. Here, we develop a biomechanical model of force and motion during feeding in Dunkleosteus terrelli that reveals a highly kinetic skull driven by a unique four-bar linkage mechanism. The linkage system has a high-speed transmission for jaw opening, producing a rapid expansion phase similar to modern fishes that use suction during prey capture. Jaw closing muscles power an extraordinarily strong bite, with an estimated maximal bite force of over 4400  N at the <b>jaw</b> <b>tip</b> and more than 5300  N at the rear dental plates, for a large individual (6  m in total length). This bite force capability is the greatest of all living or fossil fishes and is among the most powerful bites in animals...|$|E
40|$|The tooth-like {{mouthparts}} of {{some animals}} consist of biomacromolecular scaffolds with few mineral components, making them intriguing paradigms of biostructural materials. In this study, the abrasion {{resistance of the}} jaws of one such animal, the bloodworm Glycera dibranchiata, has been evaluated by nanoindentation, nanoscratching, and wear testing. The hardest, stiffest, and most abrasion-resistant materials are found within a thin (< 3 μm) surface layer near the <b>jaw</b> <b>tip</b> and a thicker (10 – 20 μm) subsurface layer, both rich in unmineralized Cu. These {{results are consistent with}} the supposition that Cu ions are involved in the formation of intermolecular coordination complexes between proteins, creating a highly cross-linked molecular network. The intervening layer contains aligned atacamite [Cu 2 (OH) 3 Cl] fibers and exhibits hardness and stiffness (transverse to the alignment direction) that are only slightly higher than those of the bulk material but lower than those of the two Cu-rich layers. Furthermore, the atacamite-containing layer is the least abrasion-resistant, by a factor of ≈ 3, even relative to the bulk material. These observations are broadly consistent with the behavior of engineering polymer composites with hard fiber or particulate reinforcements. The alignment of fibers parallel to the jaw surface, and the fiber proximity to the surface, are both suggestive of a natural adaptation to enhance bending stiffness and strength rather than to endow the surface regions with enhanced abrasion resistance...|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS. During feeding in anurans, {{the mouth}} opens while the tongue, which is {{attached}} to the mandible {{at the front of the}} mouth, rotates forward. Due to the relative simplicity of its anatomy and the complexity of its motion, tongue pro-traction in frogs presents an ideal system for exploring the neural control of mul-tijoint movements. In this study, we used a forward dynamic, rigid body model with four segments and two muscles to investigate open loop control of tongue protraction in the Australian white-lipped tree frog, Litoria caerulea. Model pa-rameters include the mass distribution, initial position and initial angular velocity of each segment and the anatomy and physiology of each muscle. Model variables include the level of muscle activation at each time step and impulsive torques to open and close the mouth. The model gives X,Y coordinates of each segment and joint angles at each time step as output. The model was tested using scaled, nor-malized EMG signals and impulsive joint torques to predict the paths of the lower <b>jaw</b> <b>tip</b> and tongue tip. Predicted paths were compared to experimentally observed paths using Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients. Simulations dem-onstrate that the genioglossus muscles likely play a minor role, if any, in deter-mining the trajectory of the tongue in most anurans. Most of the force for tongue protraction comes from angular momentum transferred to the tongue by the open-ing jaws. In anurans, tongue protraction is dynamically stable and will occur as long as the musculoskeletal elements are in the correct initial position...|$|E
50|$|Darwinopterus is {{distinguished}} from its close relatives by the greater relative {{length of the}} back portion of the skull compared to its jaws, thin nasal bone, and elongated hip bone (illium). The teeth in all species were spaced widely with the longest teeth at the <b>jaw</b> <b>tips.</b> The teeth were spike-like in form, and set into tooth sockets with raised margins. The hand bones were relatively short, even shorter than the femur. The tail was long, with over 20 vertebrae, and was partially stiffened by long, thin bony projections. Unlike other wukongopterids, the head crest found in males {{was supported by a}} thin bony extension of the skull, with a serrated top edge. The serrations probably helped anchor an even larger keratin extension.|$|R
5|$|Triceratops were herbivorous, {{and because}} of their low head, their primary food was {{probably}} low growth, although {{they may have been}} able to knock down taller plants with their horns, beak, and bulk. The <b>jaws</b> were <b>tipped</b> with a deep, narrow beak, believed to have been better at grasping and plucking than biting.|$|R
5000|$|Cycnorhamphus had {{historically}} been {{assumed to have}} had long jaws with teeth at the very tip, akin to those of Pterodactylus antiquus. However, recent work on a specimen nicknamed [...] "The Painten Pelican" [...] has revealed that the animal possesses a very unusual jaw anatomy, with peg-like teeth at the <b>jaw</b> <b>tips</b> - blunter and stouter in older individuals -, jaw curvatures behind said teeth that form angled arcs away from the biting surface, forming thus an opening, and two poorly understood soft tissue structures occupying this opening from the upper jaw, showing mineralisation. The purpose of these adaptations is unknown, but they are more obvious and well developed in adult animals. It has been speculated that the jaws functioned {{similar to those of}} openbill storks, allowing the animal to hold hard invertebrates like mollusks and either crush or bisect them.|$|R
5|$|Styracosaurs were herbivorous dinosaurs; they {{probably}} fed mostly on low growth {{because of the}} position of the head.

The <b>jaws</b> were <b>tipped</b> with a deep, narrow beak, believed to have been better at grasping and plucking than biting.|$|R
50|$|Ichthyornis {{is notable}} {{primarily}} for its combination of vertebrae which are concave both {{in front and}} back (similar to some fish, which is where it gets its name) and several more subtle features of its skeleton which set it apart from its close relatives. Ichthyornis is perhaps most well known for its teeth. The teeth were present only in the middle portion of {{the upper and lower}} <b>jaws.</b> The <b>jaw</b> <b>tips</b> had no teeth and were covered in a beak. The beak of Ichthyornis, like the hesperornithids, was compound and made up of several distinct plates, similar to the beak of an albatross, rather than a single sheet of keratin as in most modern birds. The teeth were more flattened than the rounded teeth found in crocodilians, though they became wider towards the base of the crown. The tips of the teeth were curved backward and lacked any serrations.|$|R
5000|$|Anhanguera piscator was a {{fish-eating}} {{animal with}} a wingspan of about 4.5 m (15 ft). Like many other ornithocheirids, A. piscator had a rounded crests at front of its {{upper and lower}} jaws, which were filled with angled, conical but curved teeth of various sizes and orientations. Like many of its relatives, the jaws were tapered in width, but expanded into a broad, spoon-shaped rosette at the tip. It is distinguished from its relatives by subtle differences in the crest and teeth: unlike its close relatives Coloborhynchus and Ornithocheirus, the crest on the upper jaw of Anhanguera piscator did not begin {{at the tip of}} the snout, but was set farther back on the skull, and the expanded <b>jaw</b> <b>tips</b> were slender and spoon-shaped rather than robust and box-shaped as in Coloborhynchus. Like many ornithocheiroids, (most notably the pteranodonts but also in ornithocheirids such as Ludodactylus) Anhanguera piscator had an additional crest protruding from the back of the skull. However, it was reduced to a small, blunt projection in these animals.|$|R
50|$|Unlike other trilophosaurs, Variodens did {{not have}} an edentulous, or toothless beak. Teeth are present {{throughout}} the <b>jaw</b> including its <b>tip.</b> This characteristic is also seen in some trilophosaurs from the Dockum Group of the southwestern United States.|$|R
5|$|The {{long and}} narrow skull was small in {{proportion}} to the body. It had a small antorbital fenestra, the hole between the nose and eye common to most archosaurs, including modern birds, though lost in extant crocodylians. The skull's low position suggests that Stegosaurus may have been a browser of low-growing vegetation. This interpretation is supported by the absence of front teeth and their likely replacement by a horny beak or rhamphotheca. The lower jaw of Stegosaurus jaws of Stegosaurus had flat downward and upward extensions that would have completely hidden the teeth when viewed from the side, and these probably supported a turtle-like beak in life. The presence of a beak extended along much of the jaws may have precluded the presence of cheeks in these species. Such an extensive beak was probably unique to Stegosaurus and some other advanced stegosaurids among ornithischians, which usually had beaks restricted to the <b>jaw</b> <b>tips.</b> Other researchers have interpreted these ridges as modified versions of similar structures in other ornithischians which might have supported fleshy cheeks, rather than beaks. Stegosaurian teeth were small, triangular, and flat; wear facets show that they did grind their food.|$|R
5000|$|Longipterygids are {{characterized}} by an extremely long, toothed snout (making up over 60% of the total skull length), in which the teeth are restricted to the <b>tips</b> of the <b>jaws.</b> The snouts were straight but slightly concave at a point behind the nostrils, and {{the bones of the}} snout tip were solid. Their pygostyles, the series of fused vertebrae in the tail, were unusually large, and longer than the foot bones. The feet of longipterygids were also specialized relative to other enantiornithines. Where most enantiornithines had a long middle toe with a [...] "knuckle" [...] (trochlea) that extended beyond the outer two, the toes of longipterygids were even in length, and attached {{to the rest of the}} foot at the same level. This configuration is also seen in some groups of modern birds and is usually considered an adaptation for advanced perching ability. It is likely that longipteryigids lived primarily in trees. Because their long <b>jaws</b> <b>tipped</b> with large, often curved teeth are usually considered an adaptation for catching and eating fish, it is likely that they were similar in ecology to modern Kingfishers.|$|R
