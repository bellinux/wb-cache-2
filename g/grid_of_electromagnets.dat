40|$|This paper {{presents}} a physics-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithm, known as Electromagnetic Field Optimization (EFO). The proposed algorithm {{is inspired by}} the behavior <b>of</b> <b>electromagnets</b> with different polarities and takes advantage of a nature-inspired ratio, known as the golden ratio. In EFO, a possible solution is an electromagnetic particle made <b>of</b> <b>electromagnets,</b> and the number <b>of</b> <b>electromagnets</b> {{is determined by the}} number of variables of the optimization problem. EFO is a population-based algorithm in which the population is divided into three fields (positive, negative, and neutral); attraction-repulsion forces among <b>electromagnets</b> <b>of</b> these three fields lead particles toward global minima. The golden ratio determines the ratio between attraction and repulsion forces to help particles converge quickly and effectively. The experimental results on 30 high dimensional CEC 2014 benchmarks reflect the superiority of EFO in terms of accuracy and convergence speed over other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Application of pulse {{excitation}} for {{forced vibration}} of selected eigenmode of blade wheel under rotation. The paper {{deals with a}} solution of multipoint electromagnetic pulse excitation of turbine blade wheel under rotation for analysis of its dynamic behaviour. Since a width of electromagnetic pulses should decrease with revolution speed, magnetomotoric forces acting to the blades decrease, too. So, the application <b>of</b> more “high-speed” <b>electromagnets</b> distributed along a circumference of the wheel that multiply the excitation potential seems to be inevitable for such a stiff structure. It, however, requires accurate synchronization <b>of</b> the <b>electromagnets</b> with wheel revolutions and with a dynamic response of the selected blade. Furthermore impulse excitation causes, in general, transient oscillations of many superposed eigenmodes of the wheel. Therefore an attention, herein, was paid to develop an appropriate control algorithm for the pulse excitation <b>of</b> <b>electromagnets</b> and to find a proper strategy <b>of</b> <b>electromagnet</b> interconnections to gain a multiplepoint excitation for excitation of selected eigenmodes...|$|R

The split alignment <b>of</b> C-shaped <b>electromagnets</b> about C-shaped rails has a bad effect on the lateral deviation force, therefore, no-split positioning <b>of</b> <b>electromagnets</b> is better for lateral performance. This is verified by simulations and experiments.

Instead of controlling the microrobot directly, we create equilibrium points in the magnetic force field that are stable and attractive on the plane in which the microrobot is to be controlled.

40|$|Proposed {{methods of}} {{actuating}} spacecraft in sparse aperture arrays use propellant {{as a reaction}} mass. For formation flying systems, propellant becomes a critical consumable which can be quickly exhausted while maintaining relative orientation. Furthermore, the total required propellant mass is highly dependant on [delta]V, which requires propellant mass to increase exponentially. Additional problems posed by propellant include optical contamination, plume impingement, thermal emission, and vibration excitation. For those missions where control of relative degrees of freedom is important, we consider using a system <b>of</b> <b>electromagnets,</b> in concert with reaction wheels, to replace the consumables. A system <b>of</b> <b>electromagnets,</b> powered by solar energy, does not rely on consumables such as propellant mass. To fully understand the benefits of using formation flown architectures, we first investigate how the science returns are affected, using NASA's Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) as an example. Electromagnets are then implemented on simple multi-spacecraft arrays {{to understand how the}} design impacts overall system performance.
