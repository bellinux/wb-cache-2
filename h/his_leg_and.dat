5|$|After Mawson {{slipped into}} a crevasse, they began to tie {{themselves}} to their sledges as a precaution. Ninnis developed photokeratitis (snow-blindness), which Mawson treated with zinc sulfate and cocaine hydrochloride. They were also losing dogs; one broke <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> was shot, another fell ill, and a third was lost down a crevasse. On 24 November, the party reached {{the eastern side of}} the glacier and ascended to the plateau.|$|E
5|$|After {{a failed}} attempt to rescue his first mate, Joshamee Gibbs, in London, Captain Jack Sparrow is brought before King George II.

Jack's old nemesis, Captain Hector Barbossa, now a privateer in service to the British Navy after losing <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> ship, the Black Pearl, which he says was sunk, is heading the expedition.|$|E

5|$|Nelson finally {{married in}} 1940 {{in an attempt}} to avoid the draft for World War II. His plan failed and he was drafted anyway. He joined the Military Police in Texas, but while training, he tore a muscle in <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> was {{transferred}} to Camp Murphy, which was very close to his land.|$|E
5|$|Three rescue parties {{went out}} on {{different}} routes to find the endangered party. The first, led by Lieutenant Colonel Carpenter in charge of Troop H & I of the 10th Cavalry Regiment, relieved Forsyth on September 25. Forsyth {{had been shot in}} the thigh, breaking <b>his</b> <b>leg,</b> <b>and</b> in the forehead. He was not expected to survive another day.|$|E
5|$|Brooks then {{executed}} a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost {{even with his}} Soviet counterpart Kopliakov. He had drawn level halfway through <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> made a superior turn {{to take the lead}} as they headed home. The Soviet freestyler pulled level with 25m to go before Brooks again pulled away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22s. He did not breathe in the last ten metres, and claimed to be laughing for the final five metres, confident that his opponent could not pass him. Brooks had finished his leg in 49.86s as he had vowed to his team mates. In doing so, he recorded the swiftest freestyle split in the relay, faster than that of the individual 100m freestyle gold medallist, Jörg Woithe of East Germany.|$|E

5|$|At Wisconsin, {{he was a}} four–year starter at cornerback. He {{finished}} his career with a recovered fumble and 12 interceptions, returning one for a touchdown. Before his junior season in 2000, he was suspended one game for receiving unadvertised discounts at a shoe store. After the season, he was given second–team All–Big Ten Conference honors. In 2002, after graduating from Wisconsin, he declared for the NFL Draft. He was drafted by the Titans and debuted later that season. However, after four weeks, he injured <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> missed {{the rest of the}} season. The following season, he saw limited action before being released by the team in 2004. After his stint with the Titans ended, he spent time with the Atlanta Falcons, Indianapolis Colts, and Detroit Lions, failing to appear in a game for any of the teams. In 2006, Echols played his final professional game for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the CFL, intercepting a pass in his only game for the team.|$|E
5|$|The action quickly {{revealed}} {{a breakdown in}} discipline amongst Benbow's captains. He had intended that the 64-gun HMS Defiance under Captain Richard Kirkby would lead the line of battle, but Kirkby was not maintaining his station. Benbow {{decided to take the}} lead himself, and the Breda pulled ahead, followed by the 50-gun HMS Ruby under Captain George Walton. The two maintained contact with the French throughout the night, but the other five ships refused to close. The chase ensued until 24 August, with only Benbow, Walton, and Samuel Vincent aboard HMS Falmouth making active efforts to bring the French to battle. At times, they bore the brunt of the fire of the entire squadron. The Ruby was disabled on 23 August, and Benbow ordered her to retire to Port Royal. The French resumed the action {{at two in the morning}} on 24 August, the entire squadron closing on the Breda from astern and pounding her. Benbow himself was hit by a chain-shot that broke <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> he was carried below.|$|E
5|$|Weber's {{third season}} with the Predators began {{with a series of}} injuries. After playing only 2:19 minutes of the first period in Nashville's season opening game versus the Colorado Avalanche, Weber fell awkwardly and dislocated his kneecap. The injury caused him to miss the next six weeks of play before {{returning}} to the Nashville line-up during a game with the St. Louis Blues on November 17, 2007. Weber was sidelined again shortly thereafter, injuring <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> missing another 11 games before he returned during a January 15, 2008, game versus the Calgary Flames. Weber finished the season with 20 points in 54 games played. He received a single fifth-place vote to tie for 17th with seven other players in James Norris Memorial Trophy voting as the league's best defenceman.|$|E

5|$|With the Portland match being postponed, it {{resulted}} in a three-week span of no competitive play for D.C. United. To give his players some additional rest and to ease the tensions in training sessions, head coach Ben Olsen granted the players and staff a four-week break over Labor Day Weekend. On 6 September, United players and staff rejoined one another in training, four days ahead of their trip to Los Angeles for their road fixture against Chivas USA. The 10 September match led to a 3–0 victory for United, earning their largest road victory since April. Charlie Davies netted a hat trick, scoring thrice in the run of play, each goal coming off of an assist from Chris Pontius. However, the large victory paid a devastating price, as Pontius collided with ??? in the 83rd minute, breaking <b>his</b> <b>leg,</b> <b>and</b> consequently missing {{the remainder of the}} season. The road swing concluded with a 3–0 loss to Seattle Sounders.|$|E
5|$|Granderson led off {{the first}} inning with a home run for the Mets, and scored the Mets' second run in the sixth inning. The Mets {{had a chance to}} break the game open in that sixth inning as they loaded the bases with no outs, but had to settle for one run after Céspedes lined a foul ball off <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> was injured, leaving the game after popping up for the first out of the inning. Duda hit a {{sacrifice}} fly before d'Arnaud grounded out to end the inning. Harvey pitched eight shutout innings for the Mets, and convinced Collins to keep him in the game for the ninth. He then gave up a leadoff walk to Cain in the ninth inning, and the Royals got a run when Hosmer drove Cain in with a double, prompting Collins to call upon Familia to relieve Harvey. After a groundout by Moustakas advanced Hosmer to third base with one out, Pérez hit a ground ball to third baseman Wright, who after checking Hosmer at third, threw to first base for the second out; however, Hosmer broke for home as soon as the ball was thrown, and Duda, who fielded the out at first, threw wide at home attempting to throw Hosmer out, and the latter scored the tying run, resulting in Familia blowing his third save of the postseason and the series; his eight save opportunities tied the postseason record set in 2002 by Robb Nen.|$|E
5|$|Kenneth {{takes some}} time off from his page duties to {{volunteer}} at an animal shelter. He claims his time on a pig farm {{will allow him to}} not emotionally connect with the dogs being held there, but he quickly names all of the dogs and adopts the many dogs scheduled to be euthanized that day. Kenneth asks for someone at TGS to adopt the dogs and Tracy quickly brings them all to Liz's apartment to continue annoying her. Liz and Tracy go to Jack to finally resolve their conflict. Jack decides that, because Liz ruined Tracy's life with her book, Tracy should be given the right to ruin her life, and he orders Liz to sign over her life rights to Tracy. Jack tells Liz a story about an accident he had ice climbing, falling into a crevasse. He broke <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> was unable to climb upwards to escape, but by going deeper down into the crevasse he found a path out. Liz applies this story to her situation with Tracy and stops resisting him, instead suggesting that Tracy make a pornographic film based on her life. Tracy agrees and moves out of Liz's apartment. In addition, Jenna and Liz resolve their issues when they see two adult stars acting out a scene of Jenna (Caitlin Fowler) and Liz (Savanna Samson) apologizing to one another.|$|E

He was evacuated to England, where he recovered from his wounds and returned to Australia {{at the end of}} the year.|$|E
25|$|In June 1998 McKeag, a keen motorcyclist, {{suffered}} {{serious injuries}} when his vehicle {{collided with a}} car being driven {{by a member of}} the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF).

He also had a collapsed lung and stomach damage and for a time had to wear a urostomy bag.|$|E
25|$|Smith {{first came}} to {{prominence}} as both a striker and a right winger during his early days at Leeds United; however, after moving to Manchester United he broke <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> dislocated his ankle in a match against Liverpool, whereupon manager Sir Alex Ferguson converted him to a holding midfielder, a role in which he continued after his transfer to Newcastle United. Smith has {{earned a reputation as}} a hard-tackling player and is noted for his high work rate.|$|E
