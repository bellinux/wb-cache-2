60|$|Mr. Wilks disappeared. He {{was not in}} {{his first}} lustre, but he was an ardent admirer of the sex, and in an {{absent-minded}} way he passed his arm round the handmaiden's waist, and sustained a buffet which made his <b>head</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E
60|$|The faint {{scream of}} the astounded Mrs. Truefitt brought her {{daughter}} hastily into the passage. Mr. Catesby's idea was ever to {{do a thing}} thoroughly, and, relinquishing Mrs. Truefitt, he kissed Prudence with all the ardour which a seven-years' absence might be supposed to engender {{in the heart of}} a devoted brother. In return he received a box on the ears which made his <b>head</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E

6000|$|Then {{each man}} {{stood in his}} place and {{measured}} the other with fell looks until he that directed the sport cried, [...] "Play!" [...] At this they stepped forth, each grasping his staff tightly in the middle. Then those that stood around saw the stoutest game of quarterstaff that e'er Nottingham Town beheld. At first Eric o' Lincoln thought that he would gain an easy advantage, so he came forth {{as if he would}} say, [...] "Watch, good people, how that I carve you this cockerel right speedily;" [...] but he presently found it to be no such speedy matter. Right deftly he struck, and with great skill of fence, but he had found his match in Little John. Once, twice, thrice, he struck, and three times Little John turned the blows to the left hand and to the right. Then quickly and with a dainty backhanded blow, he rapped Eric beneath his guard so shrewdly that it made his <b>head</b> <b>ring</b> again. Then Eric stepped back to gather his wits, while a great shout went up and all were glad that Nottingham had cracked Lincoln's crown; and thus ended the first bout of the game.|$|E

5000|$|Arc-Phantom Systems: An aiming bow {{attaches}} to the <b>head</b> <b>ring,</b> which is fixed to the patient's skull, and can be transferred to a similar ring that contains a simulated target. In this system, the phantom target is moved on the simulator to 3D coordinates. After adjusting the probe holder on the aiming bow so that the probe touches the desired target on the phantom, the transferable aiming bow is moved from the phantom base ring to the base ring on the patient. The probe is then lowered to the determined depth {{in order to reach}} the target point deep in the patient's brain.|$|E
5000|$|The Seri {{people in}} Sonora {{have one of}} the best-known basketry traditions, with the most {{important}} items being a kind of basket called the corita. Until the popularity of ironwood carvings, baskets were the main notable craft of the Seri. Coritas are mad with the branches of a brush or bush called torote (jatropha cuneatas), which grows in the desert. [...] Except for shoulder yokes used to carry bundles on the back, baskets were used to transport everything except liquids by the Seri. Shallow baskets were carried on the head by Seri women, balanced by the use of a <b>head</b> <b>ring</b> and carried everything from wood, harvests, meat and clothes. Baskets were used for winnowing and storage. The served as suitcases, buckets and refuse containers.|$|E
5000|$|Surgery is {{performed}} under {{the effect of}} general anesthesia. The correct position of the patient is mandatory for the ideal introduction of laryngoscope. Preferably the patient should lie flat {{on the operating table}} without any <b>head</b> <b>ring</b> or sand bag beneath the shoulders. Before introduction of the laryngoscope, dental plate should be put in place. [...] After tracheotomy, with a laser-safe endotracheal tube the patient is intubated with an ample exposition of the glottis. A small laser-protected endotracheal tube is placed in case there is no pre-existing tracheotomy.A modification to this technique is made by using endoscopic CO2 laser posterior cordotomy without tracheotomy to not compromise respiration by minimising the postoperative edema. This modified procedure involves a judicious excision of 3.5-4 mm C-shaped wedge in posterior vocal cord from the open edge of the membranous cord using carbon dioxide laser. Excision is made anteriorly to the vocal process, continuing 4 mm laterally on to the ventricular band without exposing the cartilage. A 6-7 mm transverse opening is created at the posterior larynx by the surgical resection. To avoid unwanted effects of general anesthesia and prevent any infection during the operation, antibiotics, steroids, and H2 blockers are administered intraoperatively.|$|E

5000|$|Of all the SS personnel, Karl Maria Wiligut {{could be}} best {{described}} as a Nazi occultist. The (first?) biography of him, written by Rudolf J. Mund, was titled: Himmler's Rasputin (German: Der Rasputin Himmlers, not translated into English). After his retirement from the Austrian military, Wiligut had {{been active in the}} 'ariosophic' milieu. Ariosophy was only one of the threads of Esotericism in Germany and Austria during this time. When he was involuntarily committed to the Salzburg mental asylum between November 1924 and early 1927, he received support from several other occultists. Wiligut was clearly sympathetic to the Nazi Revolution of January 1933. When he was introduced to Himmler by an old friend who had become an SS officer, he got the opportunity to join the SS under the pseudonym 'Weisthor'. He was appointed head of the Department for Pre- and Early history within the Race and Settlement Main Office (Rasse- and Siedlungshauptamt, RuSHA) of the SS. His bureau could (much more than the Ahnenerbe) be described as the occult department of the SS: Wiligut's main duty appears [...] "to have consisted in committing examples of his ancestral memory to paper." [...] Wiligut's work for the SS also included the design of the Totenkopfring (death's <b>head</b> <b>ring)</b> that was worn by SS members. He is even supposed to have designed a chair for Himmler; at least, this chair and its covers are offered for sale on the Internet.|$|E

50|$|In 1938, Himmler {{ordered the}} return of all death's <b>head</b> <b>rings</b> (German: Totenkopfringe) of dead SS-men and officers. They were to be stored in a chest in the castle.
