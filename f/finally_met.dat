5|$|Benedict Arnold and John André <b>finally</b> <b>met</b> on September 21 at the Joshua Hett Smith House. On {{the morning}} of September 22, the outpost at Verplanck's Point under command of Col. James Livingston fired on HMS Vulture, the ship that was {{intended}} to carry André back to New York. This action did sufficient damage that she retreated downriver, forcing André to return to New York overland. Arnold wrote out passes for André {{so that he would}} be able to pass through the lines, and also gave him plans for West Point.|$|E
5|$|Cleared of any {{responsibility}} for McKay's death, Byrne collected his £200 prize money, {{and as the}} winner {{earned the right to}} fight the English heavyweight champion Jem Ward. The fight was originally scheduled to take place at Leicester on 10 March 1829, but at the last minute Ward claimed that he was unfit and too ill to fight, much to the disapproval of his backers and friends. Rumours circulated that Ward had refused to enter the ring unless he received a prize money of £250 plus an additional £250 if he lost; the event became known in some quarters as the Leicester Hoax. Ward did not fight again for two years, but he and Byrne <b>finally</b> <b>met</b> on 12 July 1831 at Willeycott, near Stratford upon Avon. Each fighter was paid £200. Although Ward was the older man he prevailed in the contest after one hour and seventeen minutes, when Byrne's seconds, Tom Spring and Tom Reynolds, withdrew their man in the 33rd round.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, and at {{the urging}} of Shufeldt, Heilmann devoted much of the next few years {{attempting}} to find an English–language publisher willing to undertake a translation of his work. None of the larger publishers he approached were willing to do so unless Heilmann himself was prepared to finance it, which he was unable to do. In the meantime, Heilmann took the opportunity to revise and improve his manuscript, which included information he acquired from examining the Berlin specimen of Archaeopteryx {{for the first time in}} 1923 at the invitation of Josef Felix Pompeckj, a professor at the Natural History Museum in Berlin. Examining this important specimen in person allowed Heilmann to add some additional details and revisions to his understanding of the hip, the skull, and the flight feathers. With the help of the English paleontologist Arthur Smith Woodward of the British Museum, he <b>finally</b> <b>met</b> success in finding a small London publisher willing to produce an English version of his manuscript in 1926.|$|E

5|$|During their sojourn at Nassau, the Fly arrived. Her captain {{reported}} that she and the Hornet had fouled their riggings together and that Hornet suffered significant damage as a consequence. On March 17, the fleet sailed for Block Island Channel off Newport, Rhode Island, with Browne and other officials as prisoners. The return voyage was uneventful until the fleet reached the waters of Long Island. On April 4, they encountered and captured HMS Hawk, {{and the next day}} captured the Bolton, which was laden with stores that included more armaments and powder. The fleet <b>finally</b> <b>met</b> resistance on April 6, when it encountered the HMS Glasgow, a sixth-rate ship. In the ensuing action, the outnumbered Glasgow managed to escape capture, severely damaging the Cabot in the process, wounding her captain, Hopkins' son John Burroughs Hopkins, and killing or wounding eleven others.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Peloponnesian War, the militaristic city-state of Sparta had been able to impose a hegemony over the heartland of Classical Greece (the Peloponessus and mainland Greece south of Thessaly), the states of this area having been severely weakened by the war. This state of affairs was resented by many of the Greek city-states, which had traditionally been ferociously independent, and led directly to the Corinthian War of 395–387 BC. Sparta emerged from this conflict with its hegemony intact, though only as a result of Persian intervention, which led to the so-called King's Peace. The fragility of Spartan dominance had been demonstrated however, and in the next decade, the Thebans would revolt against Sparta. The Spartans were unable to successfully quell the revolt, leading to de facto Theban independence. Then, after several years of desultory conflict, the Thebans <b>finally</b> <b>met</b> the Spartans in open battle at Leuctra (371 BC), and under the leadership of Epaminondas inflicted an unprecedented defeat on the Spartan army, killing the Spartan king Cleombrotus I in the process.|$|E
5|$|On January 10, 2015, Benjamin, {{along with}} the rest of Suzuki-gun, took part in a major storyline, where the stable invaded a Pro Wrestling Noah show, attacking Marufuji and TMDK. Benjamin made his in-ring debut for Noah on January 12, when he, Suzuki, Taichi and Michinoku {{defeated}} Marufuji, Atsushi Kotoge, Muhammad Yone and Taiji Ishimori in an eight-man tag team match. Over the next few weeks, Benjamin worked all Noah events, while starting a feud with Takashi Sugiura due to him also having a background in amateur wrestling. Benjamin and Sugiura <b>finally</b> <b>met</b> in a grudge match on July 18, where Sugiura was victorious. In November, Benjamin made it to the finals of Noah's premier singles tournament, the Global League Tournament, but was defeated there by Naomichi Marufuji. On June 12, 2016, Benjamin unsuccessfully challenged Go Shiozaki for Noah's top title, the GHC Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

5|$|The years 1264–1267 saw the {{conflict}} {{known as the}} Second Barons' War, in which baronial forces led by Simon de Montfort fought against those who remained loyal to the King. The first scene of battle was the city of Gloucester, which Edward managed to retake from the enemy. When Robert de Ferrers, Earl of Derby, came to {{the assistance of the}} rebels, Edward negotiated a truce with the earl, the terms of which he later broke. Edward then captured Northampton from Montfort's son Simon, before embarking on a retaliatory campaign against Derby's lands. The baronial and royalist forces <b>finally</b> <b>met</b> at the Battle of Lewes, on 14May 1264. Edward, commanding the right wing, performed well, and soon defeated the London contingent of Montfort's forces. Unwisely, however, he followed the scattered enemy in pursuit, and on his return found the rest of the royal army defeated. By the agreement known as the Mise of Lewes, Edward and his cousin Henry of Almain were given up as hostages to Montfort.|$|E
25|$|Attention {{turned to}} the gravel beds of the Clutha River, {{with a number of}} {{attempts}} to develop a steam-powered mechanical gold dredge. These <b>finally</b> <b>met</b> with success in 1881 when the Dunedin became the world's first commercially successful gold dredge. The Dunedin continued operation until 1901, recovering a total of 17,000 ounces (530kg) of gold.|$|E
25|$|Robert Ford {{was born}} in 1862, in Ray County, Missouri. He was the {{youngest}} child of James Thomas Ford and his wife, the former Mary Bruin.

50|$|On December 8, 1977, he was {{involved}} in a rare four-team trade that involved the New York Mets, Atlanta Braves, Pittsburgh Pirates and the Texas Rangers. Grieve and a player to be named later (Ken Henderson) were sent to the Mets, who also received Willie Montañez from the Braves. Texas sent Adrian Devine, Tommy Boggs and Eddie Miller to Atlanta and Bert Blyleven to the Pirates. The Pirates sent Al Oliver and Nelson Norman to the Rangers, who also got Jon Matlack from the <b>Mets.</b> <b>Finally,</b> the <b>Mets</b> sent John Milner to the Pirates.|$|R

25|$|When the two armies <b>finally</b> <b>met</b> on {{the field}} they were {{approximately}} equal in numbers. While there is not complete agreement among historians on the exact numbers there is general agreement that there were about 50,000 on each side with the French having more cavalry and the allies having more infantry. Some historians put the French as more numerous and others the allies.|$|E
25|$|After the battle, Brant {{and his men}} forded the Delaware and {{continued}} back to the ruins of Oquaga. The raid failed to disrupt the Sullivan Campaign and three weeks later, the Continental Army sent 3,000 troops into upstate New York, destroying every Iroquois village in their path. Brant <b>finally</b> <b>met</b> his defeat in late August at the Battle of Newtown.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, {{during summer}} of 1971, Čolić <b>finally</b> <b>met</b> {{face to face}} with Kornelije Kovač who came to see Čolić play in Mostar and invited him to join his Korni grupa as {{replacement}} to their departed singer Dado Topić. Unlike Amabasadori, Korni grupa performed their own material and generally had a much more studious and serious approach to music, so Čolić immediately jumped at the opportunity.|$|E

He still believes that he can change the system from within.|$|R
25|$|The pincer {{movement}} of the original Sayasila plan had bogged down after GM 32 took Paksong. It would not progress until 18 October, when the regiment advanced westward from Paksong in response to Communist shelling of the Paksong airstrip. Thai mercenary troops further east on Route 23 pushed toward GM 32, and the pincers <b>finally</b> <b>met</b> on 20 October. Leaving the Thais in charge of Route 23, GM 32 returned to occupy Paksong.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} of the tower was marked by conflict over who would pay what towards the costs of construction. Construction costs were <b>finally</b> <b>met</b> by contributions from the British and Irish governments and from commercial sponsors but some problems with drainage, tree growth and surfacing in the park around the tower existed {{for the first few}} years. The park was subsequently restructured to its present design {{under the auspices of the}} Dublin City Council in 2004.|$|E
25|$|In January 1916, Stieglitz {{was shown}} a {{portfolio}} of charcoal drawings by a young artist named Georgia O'Keeffe. Stieglitz was so taken by her art that without meeting O'Keeffe or even getting her permission to show her works he made plans to exhibit her work at 291. The first that O'Keeffe heard {{about any of this}} was from another friend who saw her drawings in the gallery in late May of that year. She <b>finally</b> <b>met</b> Stieglitz after going to 291 and chastising him for showing her work without her permission.|$|E

25|$|The {{northern}} {{frontier of}} this age was also explained in Kojiki as the legend of Shido Shogun's (四道将軍: Shoguns to four ways) expedition. Out of four shoguns, Ōbiko set northward to Koshi and his son Take Nunakawawake set to eastern states. The father moved east from northern Koshi while the son moved north on his way, and they <b>finally</b> <b>met</b> at Aizu (current western Fukushima). Although the legend itself {{is not likely to}} be a historical fact, Aizu is rather close to southern Tōhoku, where the north end of keyhole kofun culture as of the late 4th century is located.|$|E
25|$|Since 2007, {{the clubs}} have again both {{been at the}} top of the ladder and have met {{regularly}} in finals. Geelong won a memorable preliminary final by five points on their way to their first flag in 44 years. In 2008, Collingwood inflicted Geelong's only home-and-away loss, by a massive 86 points, but the teams did not meet in the finals. They would meet in preliminary finals in 2009 and 2010, each winning one en route to a premiership. They <b>finally</b> <b>met</b> in a Grand Final in 2011, which Geelong won by 38 points; Geelong inflicted Collingwood's only three losses for the 2011 season.|$|E
25|$|It was in Havana {{where the}} {{encounter}} {{of the rural}} rumba and the urban rumba, that had been developing separately {{during the second half}} of the 19th century, took place. The guaracheros and rumberos that used to play with the Tiple and the Guiro <b>finally</b> <b>met</b> other Rumberos that sang and danced accompanied by the wooden box (cajón) and the Cuban Clave, and the result was the fusion of both styles in a new genre called Son. Around 1910 the Son most likely adopted the clave rhythm from the Havana-based rumba, which had been developed in the late 19th century in Havana and Matanzas.|$|E
