5|$|Since coenzymes are {{chemically}} {{changed as}} a consequence of enzyme action, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> consider coenzymes to be a special class of substrates, or second substrates, which are common to many different enzymes. For example, about 1000 enzymes are known to use the coenzyme NADH.|$|E
5|$|For {{practical}} purposes, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> {{define a}} common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While {{this could be}} at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which {{is assumed to be}} at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged—and unchargeable.|$|E
5|$|Matrices {{which have}} a single row are called row vectors, and those {{which have a}} single column are called column vectors. A matrix which has {{the same number of}} rows and columns is called a square matrix. A matrix with an {{infinite}} number of rows or columns (or both) is called an infinite matrix. In some contexts, such as computer algebra programs, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> consider a matrix with no rows or no columns, called an empty matrix.|$|E
30|$|This fact {{is quite}} {{apparent}} in the work by Wolf, Geisel, Kaschube, and coworkers, but since we focused on GRFs in this short note we felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> recall this as clearly as possible.|$|R

5|$|Multiple {{sequence}} alignments {{can also}} be used to identify functionally important sites, such as binding sites, active sites, or sites corresponding to other key functions, by locating conserved domains. When looking at multiple sequence alignments, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> consider different aspects of the sequences when comparing sequences. These aspects include identity, similarity, and homology. Identity means that the sequences have identical residues at their respective positions. On the other hand, similarity has to do with the sequences being compared having similar residues quantitatively. For example, in terms of nucleotide sequences, pyrimidines are considered similar to each other, as are purines. Similarity ultimately leads to homology, in that the more similar sequences are, the closer they are to being homologous. This similarity in sequences can then go on to help find common ancestry.|$|E
5|$|Several {{other uses}} have been {{researched}} for bupropion. There has been controversy about whether <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> add an antidepressant such as bupropion to a mood stabilizer {{in people with}} bipolar depression, but recent reviews have concluded that bupropion in this situation does no significant harm and may sometimes give significant benefit. Bupropion has shown no effectiveness {{in the treatment of}} cocaine dependence, but there is weak evidence that it may be useful in treating methamphetamine dependence. Based on studies indicating that bupropion lowers the level of the inflammatory mediator TNF-alpha, there have been suggestions that it might be useful in treating inflammatory bowel disease or other autoimmune conditions, but very little clinical evidence is available. Bupropion—like other antidepressants, with the exception of duloxetine (Cymbalta)—is not effective in treating chronic low back pain. It does, however, show some promise in the treatment of neuropathic pain.|$|E
