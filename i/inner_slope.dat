2500|$|Different {{modes of}} {{accretion}} {{are reflected in}} the morphology of the <b>inner</b> <b>slope</b> of the trench, which generally shows three morphological provinces. The lower slope comprises imbricate thrust slices that form ridges. The mid slope may comprise a bench or terraces. [...] The upper slope is smoother but may be cut by submarine canyons. [...] Because accretionary convergent margins have high relief, are continuously deforming, and accommodate a large flux of sediments, they are vigorous systems of sediment dispersal and accumulation. Sediment transport is controlled by submarine landslides, debris flows, turbidity currents, and contourites. Submarine canyons transport sediment from beaches and rivers down the upper slope. [...] These canyons form by channelized turbidites and generally lose definition with depth because continuous faulting disrupts the submarine channels. Sediments move down the inner trench wall via channels and a series of fault-controlled basins. The trench itself serves as an axis of sediment transport. If enough sediment moves to the trench, it may be completely filled so that turbidity currents are able to carry sediments well beyond the trench and may even surmount the outer swell, as in the eastern Gulf of Alaska. Sediments from the rivers of North America spill over the filled Cascadia trench and cross the Juan de Fuca plate to reach the spreading ridge several hundred kilometres to the west.|$|E

60|$|The fore-finger is {{peculiar}} in {{the frequency}} with which the direction of the slopes of its loops differs from that which {{is by far the most}} common in all other digits. A loop must have a slope, being caused by the disposition of the ridges into the form of a pocket, opening downwards to one or other side of the finger. If it opens towards the inner or thumb side of the hand, it will be called an inner slope; if towards the outer or little-finger side, it will be called an outer slope. In all digits, except the fore-fingers, the <b>inner</b> <b>slope</b> is much the more rare of the two; but in the fore-fingers the <b>inner</b> <b>slope</b> appears two-thirds as frequently as the outer slope. Out of the percentage of 53 loops of the one or other kind on the right fore-finger, 21 of them have an inner and 32 an outer slope; out of the percentage of 55 loops on the left fore-finger, 21 have inner and 34 have outer slopes. These subdivisions 21-21 and 32-34 corroborate the strong statistical similarity that was observed to exist between the frequency of the several patterns on the right and left fore-fingers; a condition which was also found to characterise the middle and little fingers.|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, the {{degeneracy}} {{between the}} unknown radial profiles of total mass and velocity anisotropy {{inherent in the}} spherical, stationary, non-streaming Jeans equation has been handled by assuming a mass profile and fitting models to the observed kinematical data. However, mass profiles are still not well known: there are discrepancies in the <b>inner</b> <b>slopes</b> of the density profiles of halos found in dissipationless cosmological N-body simulations, and the inclusion of gas alters significantly the <b>inner</b> <b>slopes</b> of both the total mass and the dark matter component. Here, the opposite approach is considered: the equation of anisotropic kinematic projection is inverted for known arbitrary anisotropy to yield the space radial velocity dispersion profile {{in terms of an}} integral involving the radial profiles of anisotropy and isotropic dynamical pressure (itself a single integral of observable quantities). Then, through the Jeans equation, the mass profile of a spherical system is derived in terms of double integrals of observable quantities. Single integral formulas for both deprojection and mass inversion are provided for several simple anisotropy models (isotropic, radial, circular, general constant, Osipkov-Merritt, Mamon-Łokas and Diemand-Moore-Stadel).

60|$|The {{principle}} of the proposed method of index-headings is, that they should depend upon a few conspicuous differences of pattern in many fingers, and not upon many minute differences in a few fingers. It is carried into effect by distinguishing the A. L. W. class of pattern on each digit in succession, by a letter,--a for Arch, l for Loop, w for Whorl; or else, as an alternative method, to subdivide l by using i for a loop with an <b>Inner</b> <b>slope,</b> and o for one with an Outer slope, {{as the case may}} be. In this way, the class of pattern in each set of ten digits is described by a sequence of ten letters, the various combinations of which are alphabetically arranged and form the different index-headings. Let us now discuss the best method of carrying out this principle, by collating the results of alternative methods of applying it. We have to consider the utility of the i and o as compared to the simple l, and the gain through taking all ten digits into account, instead of only some of them.|$|E
6000|$|A {{somewhat}} large {{experience in}} sorting finger prints {{in various ways}} and repeatedly, made it only too evident that the mental strain and risk of error caused by taking all slopes into account was considerable. The judgment became fatigued and the eye puzzled by having to assign opposite meanings to the same actual direction of a slope in {{the right and left}} hands respectively. There was also a frequent doubt as to the existence of a slope in large whorls of the spiral- and circlet-in-loop patterns (Fig. 13, ~21~, ~22~) when the impressions had not been rolled. A third objection is the rarity of the inner slopes in any other digit than the fore-finger. It acted like a soporific to the judgment not only of myself but of others, so that when an <b>inner</b> <b>slope</b> did occur it was apt to be overlooked. The first idea was to discard slopes altogether, notwithstanding the accompanying loss of index power, but this would be an unnecessarily trenchant measure. The slope of a loop, though it be on the fore-finger alone, decidedly merits recognition, for it differentiates such loops into two not very unequal classes. Again, there is little chance of mistake in noting it, the impression of the thumb on the one side and those of the remaining fingers on the other, affording easy guidance to the eye and judgment. These considerations determined the method I now use exclusively, by which Table IX. was compiled, and to which the second column of Table X., headed [...] "i and o in fore-fingers," [...] refers.|$|E

40|$|We present {{high-resolution}} Hα rotation curves for {{a sample}} of 15 dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies. From these, we derive limits {{on the slopes of}} the central mass distributions, using both a direct inversion of the rotation curves as well as detailed mass models. Assuming the density distributions of dark matter halos follow a power-law at small radii, ρ(r) ∝ r−α, we find <b>inner</b> <b>slopes</b> in the range 0 < ∼ α < ∼ 1 for most galaxies. Thus, even with the relatively high spatial resolution of the Hα rotation curves presented here the <b>inner</b> <b>slopes</b> are poorly constrained. In general, halos with constant density cores (α = 0) provide somewhat better fits, but the majority of our galaxies (∼ 75 percent) are also consistent with α = 1, as long as the R-band stellar massto-light ratios are smaller than about 2. Halos with α = 1. 5, however, are ruled out in virtually every case. In order to investigate the robustness of these results we discuss and model several possible causes of systematic errors including non-circular motions, galaxy inclination, slit width, seeing, and slit alignment errors. Taking the associated uncertainties into account, we conclude that even for the ∼ 25 percent of the cases where α = 1 seems inconsistent with the rotation curves, we cannot rule out cusp slopes this steep. Inclusion of literature samples similar to the one presented here leads to the same conclusion when the possibility of systematic errors is take...|$|R
40|$|We utilize {{existing}} {{data for}} the galaxy clusters MS 2137 – 23 and Abell 383 to present improved measures {{of the distribution of}} dark and baryonic material in the clusters' central regions. Our method, based on the combination of gravitational lensing and dynamical data, is uniquely capable of separating the distribution of dark and baryonic components at scales below 100 kpc. Our mass models include pseudoelliptical generalized NFW profiles for constraining the <b>inner</b> dark matter <b>slope.</b> We find that a variety of strong-lensing models fit the available data, including some with dark matter profiles as steep as expected from recent simulations. However, when combined with stellar velocity dispersion {{data for the}} brightest member, shallower <b>inner</b> <b>slopes</b> than predicted by numerical simulations are preferred, in general agreement with our earlier work in these clusters. For Abell 383, the preferred shallow <b>inner</b> <b>slopes</b> are statistically a good fit only when the multiple-image position uncertainties associated with our lens model are assumed to be 0. 5 ", to account for unknown substructure. No statistically satisfactory fit was obtained matching both the multiple-image lensing data and the velocity dispersion profile of the brightest cluster galaxy in MS 2137 – 23. This suggests that the mass model we are using, which comprises a pseudoelliptical generalized NFW profile and a brightest cluster galaxy component, may inadequately represent the inner cluster regions. This may arise due to halo triaxiality or by the gravitational interaction of baryons and dark matter in cluster cores. The progress made via this detailed study highlights the key role that complementary observations of lensed features and stellar dynamics offer in understanding the interaction between dark and baryonic matter on nonlinear scales in the central regions of clusters...|$|R

Our analysis focuses on stellar rotation curves derived by fitting stellar template spectra to the galaxy spectra binned along the slit. In this way, {{we are able to}} obtain accurate rotation velocity measurements for a factor of 2 more galaxies than possible with the Halpha line. Galaxies with high atomic gas mass fractions are the most dark-matter dominated galaxies in our sample and have dark matter halo density profiles that are well fit by Navarro, Frenk & White profiles with an average concentration parameter of 10. The <b>inner</b> <b>slopes</b> and of the rotation curves correlate more strongly with stellar population age than with galaxy mass or structural parameters. At fixed stellar mass, the rotation curves of more actively star-forming galaxies have steeper <b>inner</b> <b>slopes</b> than less actively star-forming galaxies. The ratio between the galaxy specific angular momentum and the total specific angular momentum of its dark matter halo, R_j, correlates strongly with galaxy mass, structure and gas content. Low mass, disk-dominated galaxies with atomic gas mass fractions greater than 20 % have median values of R_j of around 1, but massive, bulge-dominated galaxies have R_j= 0. 2 - 0. 3. We argue that these trends can be understood in a picture where gas inflows triggered by disk instabilities lead to the formation of passive, bulge-dominated galaxies with low specific angular momentum.
