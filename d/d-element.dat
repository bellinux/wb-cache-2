40|$|Myc is {{a highly}} {{unstable}} transcription factor that is destroyed by ubiquitin (Ub) -mediated proteolysis. We have previously identified an amino-terminal 'degron' within Myc that signals its destruction; this degron spans the transcriptional activation domain of Myc, and includes two highly conserved regions called Myc boxes I and II. We now report the identification of a second element [...] the <b>D-element</b> [...] which is also required for Myc proteolysis. The centrally located <b>D-element</b> is distinct from the PEST domain in Myc, but includes Myc box III, a third highly conserved region with no previously known function. We show that deletion of the <b>D-element</b> stabilizes the Myc protein without affecting its ubiquitylation, and report that the <b>D-element</b> and the degron act in a cell-type-specific manner to direct Myc proteolysis. These data thus demonstrate that Myc stability is regulated at both the ubiquitylation and postubiquitylation levels, and reveal that substrates of the Ub-proteasome system can be targeted for destruction differently in different cell types...|$|E

40|$|We report structural, magnetic, {{transport}} and thermal properties of single-crystal Ca 2 Ru 1 -xIrxO 4 (0 < x< 0. 65). Ca 2 RuO 4 is a structurally-driven Mott insulator with a metal-insulator transition at TMI = 357 K, which is well separated from antiferromagnetic order at TN = 110 K. Substitution of 5 d element, Ir, for Ru enhances spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and locking between the structural distortions and magnetic moment canting. In particular, Ir doping intensifies the distortion or rotation of Ru/IrO 6 octahedra and induces weak ferromagnetic behavior along the c-axis. Moreover, the magnetic ordering temperature TN increases from 110 K at x = 0 to 215 K with enhanced magnetic anisotropy at x = 0. 65. The effect of Ir doping sharply contrasts {{with that of}} 3 <b>d-element</b> doping such as Cr, Mn and Fe, which suppresses TN and induces unusual negative volume thermal expansion.

Physical processes can be simulated by partial differential equations that can be solved i. e. numerical with the finite-element-method and requires adjusted nets. So far for simulations of flow waters mainly one or two dimensional methods of calculations were used. However complex geometries with complex flow procedures demand a complete three dimensional numerical simulation system with free surface flow, for which certain additional conditions and requirements have to be kept. Methods for the 3 D-netgeneration for this problem-area with the here valid restrictions are not known so far. In this work a new solution-concept for the generation of such 3 D-nets is presented. An essential step is the creation of a thus named " 2 D-map" (P-net), which already contains (except for optimization) all essential controls for the 3 D-netgeneration. The production of not allowed and therefore still to be decomposed 3 <b>D-elements</b> is in general not preventible. The P-netgeneration orientates mainly at the reduction of the generation of elements of the p-plane which will become to be decomposed elements by the 3 D-generation.

For this purpose, we have developed the FLAPW-Fourier theory (Full potential Linearized Augmented Plane Wave), which is capable of determining the square of the Fermi diameter, (2 k F) 2, and the number of itinerant electrons per atom, e/a, as well as the set of lattice planes participating in the interference phenomenon. By determining these key parameters, we could test the interference condition and clarify how it contributes to the formation of a pseudogap at the Fermi level. Further significant progress has been made to allow us to equally handle transition metal (TM) elements and their compounds. A method of taking the center of gravity energy for energy distribution of electrons with a given electronic state has enabled us to eliminate the d-band anomaly and to determine effective (2 k F) 2, and e/a, even for systems involving the d-band or an energy gap across the Fermi level.
