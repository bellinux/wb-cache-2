40|$|In this paper, we {{put forward}} a new account <b>of</b> <b>emergence</b> called “transformational emergence”. Such an account captures a variety <b>of</b> <b>emergence</b> that can be {{considered}} as being diachronic and weakly ontological. The fact that transformational emergence actually constitutes a genuine form <b>of</b> <b>emergence</b> is motivated. Besides, the account is free of traditional problems surrounding more usual, synchronic versions <b>of</b> <b>emergence,</b> and it can find a strong empirical support in a specific physical phenomenon, the fractional quantum Hall effect, which has long been touted as a paradigmatic case <b>of</b> <b>emergence...</b>|$|R
40|$|Seeds {{uniformity}} and seedling establishment {{are major}} problem in pepper production in developing countries and have great impact on production quality and performance. Seed enhancement technology like hydropriming {{can be done to}} address this gap. A study was initiated to determine the physiological quality of three Capsicum species (Capsicum annuum, Capsicum frutescens and Capsicum chinense) in relation to seed density and hydropriming treatment durations. In the first experiment, fresh ungraded seeds were subjected to different hours of hydropriming durations with second experiment light and heavy density seed lots were subjected to the same hydropriming durations. Seedling <b>emergence,</b> energy <b>of</b> <b>emergence,</b> seedling vigour index and emergence rate were evaluated in the experiments. The result revealed that among the ungraded, light and heavy density seed lots, Capsicum chinense had superior seedling <b>emergence,</b> energy <b>of</b> <b>emergence,</b> seedling vigour index and emergence index. Hydropriming for 0 to 12 h resulted in lower days to <b>emergence.</b> Hydropriming <b>of</b> light density seeds gave high seedling emergence in the three Capsicum species compared to hydropriming of heavy density seeds. An increase in hydropriming durations of the light density seeds resulted in an increase in the seedling <b>emergence,</b> energy <b>of</b> <b>emergence,</b> seedling vigour and emergence index. Positive and significant relationships were obtained between seedling <b>emergence</b> or energy <b>of</b> <b>emergence</b> and seedling vigour index {{in each of the three}} Capsicum species over the hydropriming durations. Therefore, the study suggests the use of hydropriming as a simple and cost-effective strategy in pepper production especially in developing countries...|$|R
5|$|After hatching, the {{offspring}} {{feed on the}} tissue of the cicadas provided by their mother. Males emerge before females and both genders are sexually receptive from emergence in July to early August, when they mate and brood. English naturalist Charles Darwin postulated that the pattern of male emergence before females evolved by natural selection to improve the chances of the male mating. The timing of the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> females has evolved to correspond with the similar <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> the cicada species of the area, Tibicen duryi and T.parallela, which they hunt for the provisioning of their nests. Many have yellow markings located on their tergites (dorsal portion), although some have been found only from the first to fifth tergites.|$|E

I evaluate these accounts with respect to several specific contexts in which emergence seems to be an appropriate way of characterizing expertise in groups.

40|$|The British emergentists {{have their}} {{pros and cons}} in the {{discussion}} <b>of</b> <b>emergence.</b> They succeeded in expressing the basic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>emergence,</b> but failed to explain how and why a property became emergence. So, the main subject <b>of</b> studying <b>emergence</b> is to explore the dynamics at present. This article redescribes the concept <b>of</b> <b>emergence</b> and proposes the concept <b>of</b> dynamics <b>of</b> <b>emergence</b> to explain how emergence comes into being. The dynamics <b>of</b> <b>emergence</b> {{can be divided into}} two parts: micro-dynamics and macro-dynamics. The former deals with the emergence coming from the interaction of pre-existing components of a system through their local interaction, bifurcation and iterative effect going to global pattern, while the latter discusses what the macro conditions and environments <b>of</b> <b>emergence</b> are, how systems adapt to the environment and how the environment selects systems at the edge of chaos.

40|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>emergence,</b> {{like that}} <b>of</b> complexity, {{is central to}} the {{development}} of sociocybernetics and social systems theory. The classical “whole is greater {{than the sum of its}} parts ” model is a traditional model not only <b>of</b> <b>emergence,</b> but also <b>of</b> a social system, with individuals being the parts, and society (as derived through interaction among individuals) being the “emergent “whole”. While the models <b>of</b> <b>emergence</b> as presented by Buckley, Luhmann, Miller, and others may differ in form and in their relation to complexity, they all recognize emergence as a “bottom-up ” hierarchical concept. All of these models view emergence as aggregative and as essentially irreducible. However, emergence is a multidimensional concept, rather than being essentially unidimensional, as is usually assumed. The only way to adequately present and analyze all of the dimensions <b>of</b> <b>emergence</b> is through a typology. The purpose of this paper is to construct this typology. The typology will subsequently be used as a mechanism for recognizing and analyzing the various types <b>of</b> <b>emergence</b> that exist in contemporary social systems theory and sociocybernetics, with the aim of ultimately eliminating much of the confusion that now surrounds the concept <b>of</b> <b>emergence...</b>|$|R
30|$|There is no gold-standard {{rating scale}} for {{evaluating}} the degree <b>of</b> <b>emergence</b> agitation in adult patients. Therefore, we applied a modified PAED scale to evaluate the degree <b>of</b> <b>emergence</b> agitation in this study. The original PAED scale, which was developed to measure emergence agitation in children, consists of five parameters (each with scores ranging from 0 to 4) reflecting the overall degree <b>of</b> <b>emergence</b> agitation [8, 14, 15]. The scores are summed to obtain a total score (ranging from 0 to 20, with a higher score indicating a greater severity <b>of</b> <b>emergence</b> agitation). In this study, we excluded inconsolableness from the PAED scale {{for evaluating the}} severity <b>of</b> <b>emergence</b> agitation in adults.|$|R
40|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>emergence</b> {{is central}} to {{artificial}} life and complexity science, yet quantitative, intuitive, and easy-to-apply measures <b>of</b> <b>emergence</b> are surprisingly lacking. Here, I introduce a just such a measure, G-emergence, which operationalizes the notion that an emergent process is both dependent upon and autonomous from its underlying causal factors. G-emergence {{is based on a}} nonlinear time series analysis adapted from ‘Granger causality’ and it provides a measure not only <b>of</b> <b>emergence</b> but also <b>of</b> apparent ‘downward causation’. I illustrate the measure by application to a canonical example <b>of</b> <b>emergence,</b> an agent-based simulation of bird flocking, and I discuss its potential impact on perhaps the most challenging of all scientific problems involving emergence: consciousness...|$|R
