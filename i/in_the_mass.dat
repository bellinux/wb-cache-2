Most {{of the original}} winding highway was bypassed in 1962, and the route was extended west in 1963 to what was then Highway40, now the St. Clair Parkway. It remained this way for over 30 years before being decommissioned as a provincial highway entirely <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> downloading of highways in 1997.

5|$|At the 2011 World Championships in Khanty-Mansiysk, Neuner {{won three}} gold and two silver medals. She claimed silver, {{alongside}} Andrea Henkel, Arnd Peiffer and Michael Greis, {{in the opening}} mixed relay. On 5 March 2011, Neuner won the sprint race courtesy of a clean shooting performance. She {{finished second in the}} pursuit and fifth in the individual subsequently. On 12 March 2011, Neuner won her second title <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> start despite of four shooing errors. The following day she also claimed gold in the women's relay, together with Andrea Henkel, Miriam Gössner and Tina Bachmann. Running the last leg for Germany, Neuner started in fourth, 67.5seconds off the lead, but she pulled back the entire time and moved in front on the last lap. Her five medals made her the most successful female athlete in the history of Biathlon World Championships.|$|E
5|$|Born {{in rural}} Russia in 1902, Suslov {{became a member}} of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1921 and studied {{economics}} for much of the 1920s. He left his job as a teacher in 1931 to pursue politics full-time, becoming one of the many Soviet politicians who took part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> repression begun by Joseph Stalin's regime. Suslov impressed the Soviet leadership to such an extent in the pre-Eastern Front Soviet Union that he was made First Secretary of Stavropol Krai administrative area. During the war, Suslov headed the local Stavropol guerrilla movement. He {{became a member of}} the Organisational Bureau (Orgburo) of the Central Committee in 1946 and, four years later, was elected to the Presidium (Politburo) of the All-Union Communist Party.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the spring}} {{classics}} season ending without any victories, Nygaard stated he felt {{satisfied with the}} many high placings the team had achieved, particularly {{in the face of}} Gilbert's clear strength. Additionally, Leopard Trek became the number one team in the UCI's rankings after Liège–Bastogne–Liège, a position they had occupied, to no small amount of criticism, before the season and before they officially existed. Nizzolo closed out the team's early-season account by with a podium finish at the inaugural ProRace Berlin, taking second <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> sprint behind 's Marcel Kittel.|$|E

5|$|In October, Wegmann rode to sixth {{place in}} his native Germany <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> finish to the Sparkassen Giro. The next day, trainee rider Rüdiger Selig won a {{selective}} sprint finish at Binche–Tournai–Binche, beating out former Tour de France green jersey winner Baden Cooke and a field including seven first-division teams. Viganò nearly joined him on the podium, taking fourth place. Zaugg then showed signs of his coming late-season form at the Giro dell'Emilia, finishing in ninth place 33 seconds back of the solo winner. The team took two top-ten places at the next day, at concurrent races, the GP Bruno Beghelli and Paris–Tours. At the Italian race, Monfort found his way into a winning breakaway that formed as the morning's initial breakaway was caught, eventually finishing the day in 7th place, 21 seconds behind the winner Filippo Pozzato. At {{the same time in}} France, O'Grady rode to an 8th-place finish behind 's Greg Van Avermaet.|$|E
5|$|In September 1939, Fegelein {{commanded}} the SS Totenkopf Reiterstandarte (Death's-Head Horse Regiment), which arrived in Poland {{shortly after the}} end of the Polish Campaign. The unit was placed under the command of the Ordnungspolizei (Orpo; order police) and was split into small groups assigned to support police activities at posts throughout the Poznan district. On 15 November, Himmler ordered the expansion of the regiment from four to thirteen squadrons and renamed it as 1. SS-Totenkopf-Reiterstandarte (1st Death's Head Cavalry Regiment). Additional men were recruited from ethnic Germans living in the General Government and further afield. Many of the officers, including Fegelein, had never attended officer training school, so much of the training provided to new recruits was rudimentary. However, it was rigorous, and the men developed a strong camaraderie. Fegelein's unit was involved alongside the Orpo in the extermination, ordered by Hitler, of members of the Polish elite such as intellectuals, aristocrats, and clergy, in an action called Intelligenzaktion. On 7 December 1939 Fegelein's unit was involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> shooting of 1,700 such people in the Kampinos Forest.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} this geopolitical perspective, Pablo {{argued that the}} only way the Trotskyists could avoid {{isolation}} was for various sections of the Fourth International to undertake long-term entryism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> Communist or Social Democratic parties. This tactic was known as entrism sui generis, to distinguish it from the short-term entry tactic employed before World War II. For example, it meant that the project of building an open and independent Trotskyist party was shelved in France, because it was regarded as not politically feasible alongside entry into the French Communist Party.|$|E

With a second-place finish in the penultimate mass start race of the season, Neuner won the 2007–08 Mass start World Cup. At the season final in Oslo, she also claimed the season's Sprint World Cup and took over the yellow bib of the Overall World Cup leader {{for the first time}} in her career. In the last race of the season, a ninth place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> start ensured Neuner the 2007–08 Overall Biathlon World Cup victory.

Seven people are confirmed dead from Rita's direct effects, and total damage from the storm is estimated at $10billion, almost entirely in Texas and Louisiana. 55-112 indirect deaths have also been reported, most resulting from incidents during the evacuation of Houston when the storm was predicted to strike the city.

5|$|Neuner {{suffered}} further setbacks at the 2009 World Championships in Pyeongchang, {{where she}} struggled {{with a cold}} and {{a high number of}} shooting errors.

She was not appointed for the individual race and could not start in the mixed relay due to her cold. On 21 February 2009, Neuner claimed silver as part Germany's women's relay team, alongside Martina Beck, Andrea Henkel and Kati Wilhelm.
