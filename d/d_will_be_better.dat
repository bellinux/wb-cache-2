40|$|It {{is shown}} that, among all {{two-dimensional}} convex domains, circles {{can be characterized}} by the property that for all circumscribed rectangles the midpoints of the sides meet the domain. The proof uses Fourier series, and this method yields not only such characterizations but also corresponding stability results. Moreover, some analogous results for the d-dimensional case (d 3) are established. 1. Introduction Let E d denote the d-dimensional euclidean space, and k Δ k its norm. Nonempty compact convex subsets of E <b>d</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> called convex bodies in E d, and the class of all convex bodies in E <b>d</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> denoted by K d. Convex bodies in E 2 <b>will</b> <b>be</b> referred to as convex domains. S dΓ 1 signifies the (d Γ 1) -dimensional unit sphere in E d centered at the origin of E d. Balls (solid spheres) in E d are always assumed to be euclidean balls. A box in E d is defined to be a d-dimensional rectangular parallelotope. D(K) denotes the diameter of K. Ob [...] ...|$|R
