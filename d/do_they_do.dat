500|$|Ten {{days before}} the film's premiere, the Church of Scientology took out full-page {{advertisements}} in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times to denounce Going Clear, comparing it to the story [...] "A Rape on Campus" [...] published by Rolling Stone magazine. Gibney subsequently {{said that he was}} grateful for the church's advertising, as it had attracted much publicity for the film; he only wished [...] "they'd put in showtimes". The head of HBO Documentary Films, Sheila Nevins, commented that when she saw the adverts she knew that Going Clear would be a big success: [...] "Docs don’t get full page ads, and when they <b>do,</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> really well." ...|$|E

During the 1830s, he reacted against misogyny, arguing in favor of women's rights: [...] "Who has made man create himself unfair laws and customs, in order for him to {{cultivate}} his spirit and forsake [...] into ignorance...?". In 1859, after the Jewish community in Galaţi fell victim to a pogrom, he spoke out against Antisemitic blood libel accusations: [...] "Jews do not eat children in England, nor do they in France, nor do they in Germany, nor <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> so wherever humans have become humans. Where else are they accused of such an inhumane deed? Wherever peoples are still Barbaric or semi-Barbaric".|$|E

On June 14, 2006, she made a guest appearance on C-SPAN with Dr. Bob Meaders, the founder of Operation Helmet. That year, {{in an interview with}} Stars and Stripes, she explained her [...] "against the war in Iraq but for the troops" [...] position: [...] "I don't have to be for this war to support the troops because these men and women do what they think is right.

500|$|One of Wollstonecraft's most scathing criticisms in the Rights of Woman {{is against}} false and {{excessive}} sensibility, particularly in women. She argues {{that women who}} succumb to sensibility are [...] "blown about by every momentary gust of feeling"; because these women are [...] "the prey of their senses", they cannot think rationally. In fact, not only <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> harm to themselves but they also do harm to all of civilization: these are not women who can refine civilization – these are women who will destroy it. But reason and feeling are not independent for Wollstonecraft; rather, she believes that they should inform each other. For Wollstonecraft, as for the important 18th-century philosopher David Hume, the passions underpin all reason. This was a theme that she would return to throughout her career, but particularly in her novels [...] (1788) and [...]|$|E

500|$|It's {{closing time}} at the Krusty Krab, and Squidward answers a last-minute call from a customer. Just as {{he is about to}} tell them that the {{restaurant}} is closed, Mr. Krabs suddenly appears and snatches the phone from Squidward's hands. The customer wants to order a pizza and have it delivered, an order Mr. Krabs happily accepts knowing he could get extra money. Squidward protests this by saying the restaurant doesn't serve pizza nor <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> deliveries, but Mr. Krabs spontaneously makes a pizza out of Krabby Patties and forces Squidward and SpongeBob to deliver it. After SpongeBob does a few [...] "safety checks" [...] of the delivery boat, Squidward forces him to drive. However, SpongeBob cannot drive as he is still in boating school, but Squidward insists saying [...] "it's just around the corner". SpongeBob tries to shift into reverse, but panics and ends up [...] "backing up" [...] for miles and miles until the boat runs out of gas {{in the middle of a}} desert. Squidward complains about this, and eventually kicks the boat out of frustration after SpongeBob mentions that the pizza is getting cold. This causes the boat to suddenly drive back to the Krusty Krab, leaving the two stranded and to continue their delivery on foot.|$|E

On the British black metal {{documentary}} [...] (2007), all interviewed musicians stated - {{when asked about the}} matter - that black metal cannot be Christian. The term [...] "Christian black metal" [...] drew mocking replies from the black metal musicians, for example Martin Walkyier of the English metal band Sabbat commented: [...] "'Christian black metal?' What <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>do?</b> Do they build churches? Do they repair them?

[...] Explaining his love for sports writing, Macdonell once asked and answered this question while interviewing Hank Greenberg: [...] "When millionaires retire what <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>do?</b> [...] They go to big golf tournaments, visit Florida baseball camps, attend big prize fights and watch Davis Cup matches at Forest Hills. It is their idea of paradise, the ideal existence. A sports writer is even closer to the fun than an ordinary spectator. Why should he give up all that if his health is OK?" ...|$|E

Why? Because now he can use this book, which he has written : 'THE LAW THAT NEVER WAS' in his defense." [...] Similarly, {{as late as the}} year 2007, Benson claimed, in marketing the [...] "Reliance Defense Package" [...] that included his non-ratification argument, that [...] "o date, the IRS has steadfastly refused to prosecute any person standing on this defense. Why <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> this? Because they know they cannot win!!" [...] The book was actually published several years before Benson's arrest and, as noted above, Benson himself actually was convicted despite using the defense.|$|E
2500|$|... "This {{argument}} was substantially undermined on November 15, 1991, {{only a day}} after the indictments were issued against the two Libyan accused. On that day the US State Department issued 'fact sheets' which detailed the evidence against the two accused. The information they contained has been repeated in numerous media reports and at least two books published in the UK since that time. One of the media reports was an item about how the Scottish and US authorities 'solved' the Lockerbie case, contained in a BBC 'How <b>Do</b> <b>They</b> <b>Do</b> That?' programme broadcast on February 15, 1994. It featured the former Chief Constable of Dumfries and Galloway, John Boyd. So far as we are aware, neither the Crown Office nor the Lord Advocate ever issued similarly critical statements against the BBC, John Boyd, {{or any of the other}} broadcasters, newspapers or book publishers which have raked over the evidence.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{his time}} as an NSA analyst, {{directing}} the work of others, Snowden recalled a moment {{when he and his}} colleagues began to have severe ethical doubts. Snowden said 18 to 22-year-old analysts were suddenly [...] "thrust into a position of extraordinary responsibility, where they now have access to all your private records. In the course of their daily work, they stumble across something that is completely unrelated in any sort of necessary sense—for example, an intimate nude photo of someone in a sexually compromising situation. But they're extremely attractive. So what <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>do?</b> They turn around in their chair and they show a co-worker ... and sooner or later this person's whole life has been seen by all of these other people." [...] As Snowden observed it, this behavior happened routinely every two months but was never reported, being considered one of the [...] "fringe benefits" [...] of the work.|$|E
