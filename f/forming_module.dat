40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a pseudo-droop control structure integrated within a microgrid system through Distributed Power Generation modules capable {{to function in}} off-grid islanded, genset-connected and grid-connected modes of operation. System efficiency has {{an important role in}} order to harvest the maximum available renewable energy from DC or AC sources whilst providing power back-up capability. A control strategy is proposed in off grid islanded mode method based on the microgrid line frequency control as agent of communication for energy control between the DPG modules. A critical case is where the AC load demand could be lower than the available power from the photovoltaic solar array where the battery bank can be overcharged with unrecoverable damage consequences. The DPG voltage <b>forming</b> <b>module</b> controls the battery charge algorithm with a frequency generator function and the DPG current source module controls its output current through a frequency detection function. The physical installation between DPG modules is independent since no additional communication wiring is needed between power modules which represent another integration advantage within the microgrid type application.

40|$|At a late {{stage in}} Drosophila oogenesis, nurse cells rapidly expel their {{cytoplasm}} into the oocyte via intracellular bridges {{by a process}} called nurse cell dumping. Before dumping, numerous cables composed of actin filaments appear in the cytoplasm and extend inward from the plasma membrane toward the nucleus. This actin cage prevents the nucleus, which becomes highly lobed, from physically blocking the intracellular bridges during dumping. Each cable is composed of a linear series of modules composed of ∼ 25 cross-linked actin filaments. Adjacent modules overlap in the cable like the units of an extension ladder. During cable formation, individual modules are nucleated from the cell surface as microvilli, released, and then cross-linked to an adjacent <b>forming</b> <b>module.</b> The filaments in all the modules in a cable are unidirectionally polarized. During dumping as {{the volume of the}} cytoplasm decreases, the nucleus to plasma membrane distance decreases, compressing the actin cables that shorten as adjacent modules slide passively past one another just as the elements of an extension ladder slide past one another for storage. In Drosophila, the modular construction of actin cytoskeletons seems to be a generalized strategy. The behavior of modular actin cytoskeletons has implications for other actin-based cytoskeletal systems, e. g., those involved in Listeria movement, in cell spreading, and in retrograde flow in growth cones and fibroblasts...|$|E

40|$|Alginate is {{a family}} of industrially {{important}} polysaccharides composed of irregular sequences of 1 - 4 linked β-D-mannuronic acid (M) and α-L-guluronic acid (G). They are widely used industrially as iscosifiers and gelling agents. Medical applications include utilization as dental impression materials, wound dressings and as an encapsulation matrix for cell transplants {{in the treatment of}} various diseases. Some alginates are immunogenic or have anti-tumor activity. Commercial alginates are extracted from brown seaweeds, but the polymer is also produced by members of the bacterial genera Pseudomonas and Azotobacter. Probably in all species the alginate is first synthesized as polymannuronic acid, and then the guluronic acid moieties are introduced at the postpolymerization level by the action of mannuronan C- 5 - epimerases. Azotobacter vinelandii encodes a family of 7 secreted, Ca 2 + -dependent mannuronan C- 5 -epimerases, AlgE 1 - 7, which are composed of varying numbers of two types of structural modules, A and R. The A-modules alone are catalytically active, but their reaction rates are substantially increased when linked to at least one R-module. The various epimerases introduce different sequential M/G patterns into the alginate. AlgE 4 strictly forms alternating sequences (MG-blocks), while AlgE 2, AlgE 5 and AlgE 6 produce blocks of contiguous G-residues (G-blocks) which vary in length and distribution. AlgE 1 and AlgE 3 contain two catalytic modules, one G-block <b>forming</b> <b>module</b> and one strictly MG-forming module. AlgE 7 is special in that it is both an epimerase and an alginate lyase. A. vinelandii produces alginate both as a vegetative capsule and as an essential constituent of the coat surrounding a resting stage designated cyst. The AlgE-epimerases are believed {{to play an important role}} in designing the composition and properties of the cyst alginate, and they are secreted at different stages during cyst formation and germination. In this study the structure-function relationship of the mannuronan C- 5 -epimerases AlgE 4 and AlgE 2 has been studied. The 377 amino acids long AlgE 4 A-module has been expressed recombinantly in Escherichia coli, and after purification the structure of the protein was solved by X-ray crystallography by the group of Dr. B. Dijkstra at the University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands. The protein was found to fold into a right-handed β-helix with 4 parallel sheets, PB 1, PB 2 a, PB 2 b and PB 3. Like in other enzymes with this fold, the catalytic site seems to be positioned in a groove, formed by PB 1 and the turns T 1 and T 3. The catalysis is believed to involve the amino acids Tyr 149, Asp 152 and His 154, but other amino acids in their vicinity are also required for activity. The predicted substrate groove is highly basic in ontrast to the rest of the protein, which is generally acidic, accommodating binding of the acidic alginate polymer. By interchanging internal corresponding parts of the A-modules of AlgE 2 and AlgE 4, a series of hybrid enzymes have been constructed. All these hybrids were active and NMR spectroscopical analyses showed that several formed M/G patterns differing from and intermediating those of the parent enzymes. Amino acids in the central part of the sequence were shown to highly influence the epimerization pattern and they correspond to a band of amino acids at the C-terminal proximity of the proposed catalytic site. The same amino acids seem to influence the level of processivity of the enzymes and the reaction rate. For all previously studied mannuronan C- 5 -epimerases it has been shown that they act according to a non-random mode of action. Interestingly, one of the hybrid enzymes, designated KA 1, seemed to generate alginates as if it had acted in a near-random mode. The reaction rate of the enzyme was however low, implying that it might bind poorly to the substrate. A new epimerase gene from Pseudomonas syringae pv glycinea PG 4180, which partially showed high sequence similarity with the A. vinelandii algE-epimerases, was characterized and found to encode a bifunctional enzyme. The enzyme, designated PsmE, contained two catalytic sites comprising mannuronan C- 5 - epimerase and mannuronan O-acetyl hydrolase activity, respectively. The deduced enzyme is composed of 1610 amino acids, and showed a complex modular structure, A-R 1 -R 2 -M-R 3 -N-RTX-S. The A- and Rmodules are similar to those present in the A. vinelandii AlgE-epimerases, and the A-module was found to be 53 - 61 % identical to the AlgE-A-modules. The Mmodule is similar to the Ca 2 + -binding dystroglycan-type cadherin-like domains, RTX is similar to the R-modules and the Ca 2 + -binding modules of RTX-toxins, while the N-module comprises the acetyl hydrolase activity. Bacterial alginates are partly acetylated, and such modified residues cannot be epimerized. It was therefore very interesting to note that the acetyl hydrolase activity of PsmE enabled the enzyme to epimerize such alginates to a much greater extent than the AlgE epimerases. PsmE was found to form some of the longest G-blocks known, and a hybrid (PsmeA 4 R) between its catalytic A-module and the R-module from AlgE 4 was able to transform an alternating alginate into a 96 % G-alginate. The enzyme was active on various types of alginates, and when acting on pure mannuronan, the epimerase activity was highest around 37 °C in a 50 mM Mops buffer at pH 6. 8, containing 0. 8 mM CaCl 2. At higher temperatures the enzyme was rapidly inactivated. Initial studies using a promoter-probe vector to investigate the putative algE -epimerase promoters, showed that the genes are regulated independently of each other and that they all contained promoter regions. The algE 4 -promoter was found to be active during the encystment process, while the promoters of algE 2, algE 3 and algE 5 were transcribed in the vegetative state. The algE 1 promoter was not active in the vegetative stage, but it was activated in the encystment process and possessed the highest activity found. The promoters of algE 6 and algE 7 were mainly transcribed during germination. A biological study of an AlgE 7 knock-out mutant revealed that the enzyme, which possesses a lyase activity, is not required for cyst germination. Work has also been initiated to knock out the other epimerase genes in A. vinelandii. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

40|$|Genetic {{algorithms}} generally use a fixed problem representation that maps {{variables of}} the search space to variables of the problem, and operators of variation that are fixed over time. As a result, the potential to explore combinations of large partial solutions is limited. This is problematic when the search space of a problem is large, and scalability is required. To address this issue, several researchers have proposed methods that <b>form</b> <b>modules</b> during the search. An open question is how modules in the resulting coevolutionary setup should be evaluated. Recently, a theoretical basis for evaluation in coevolution has been provided by Pareto-coevolution. We define the notion of functional modularity, and define objectives for module evaluation based on Pareto-Coevolution. It is shown that optimization of these objectives maximizes functional modularity. The resulting evaluation method is developed into an algorithm for variable length, open ended representation development called DevRep. DevRep simultaneously <b>forms</b> <b>modules</b> and searches the space of module combinations.
