5|$|Although slight {{changes in}} water level affect many species, {{the system as}} a whole also cycles and pulses with each change. Some transformations to the {{diversity}} of plant and animal life are natural, caused by fire or storms, and some are induced by humans, such as urban encroachment, the introduction of exotic species, and rapid global warming. Environmental conditions in the Everglades favor no particular species. Some species, such as snail kites and apple snails, <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> wet conditions, but wood storks and Cape Sable seaside sparrows (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis) <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> dryer circumstances.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{having lost}} 5–0 to the West Indies {{in each of}} the two most recent series, England had grounds for {{optimism}} leading up to the Test series: the West Indian team was ageing and lacked a leg-spinner; and the England team had home advantage. England's morale was also surging following good performances in the shorter form of the game: the team had reached the World Cup Final the previous year, losing to Australia, and were expected to <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> One Day International cricket, even against the West Indies.|$|E

5|$|In 1919 a Large Black sow was Supreme Champion at Smithfield (UK), {{and at the}} Royal Show {{that year}} 121 Large Blacks were entered, {{more than any other}} breed. Popularity of the breed peaked in the 1920s, however, and after World War II, {{population}} numbers declined as farmers began to favour pig breeds that would <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> intensive indoor farming. The breed association was merged with the National Pig Breeders Association (later the British Pig Association) in 1949.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{grown as}} an {{ornamental}} tree in Northern Hemisphere countries with mild maritime climates, including {{parts of the}} upper West Coast of the United States and the warmer parts of the British Isles, where its common names include Torbay palm and Torquay palm.

5|$|It {{is fairly}} easy to grow in areas with a Mediterranean climate, but does not <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> areas with high summer humidity. It {{requires}} a sunny position in well-drained soil, and tolerates at least moderate frost. It should be pruned lightly, not below the green foliage, as it tends to become straggly with age otherwise. Seeds do not require any treatment prior to sowing, and take 21 to 35 days to germinate.|$|E

5|$|Seeing {{himself as}} the heir to Chibás, Castro wanted to run for Congress in the June 1952 elections.

5|$|These snakes <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> captivity, {{but there}} are reports of gluttony. Kauffeld (1969) {{mentions}} that specimens can be maintained for years on only one meal per week, but that when offered all they can eat, the result is often death, or at best wholesale regurgitation. They are bad-tempered snakes and some specimens never settle down in captivity, always hissing and puffing when approached.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} trade, infants {{are pulled}} prematurely from their parents, leaving them unable to remove their own urine, feces, and oily skin {{secretions}} from their fur. Slow lorises have a special network of blood vessels in their hands and feet, which makes them vulnerable to cuts when pulled from the wire cages they are kept in. Slow lorises are also stress-sensitive and do not <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> captivity. Common health problems seen in pet slow lorises include undernourishment, tooth decay, diabetes, obesity, and kidney failure. Infection, stress, pneumonia, and poor nutrition lead to high death rates among pet lorises. Pet owners also fail to provide proper care because they are usually asleep when the nocturnal pet is awake.|$|E

5|$|Castro co-founded a legal {{partnership}} that primarily catered for poor Cubans, although it proved a financial failure. Caring little for money or material goods, Castro {{failed to pay}} his bills; his furniture was repossessed and electricity cut off, distressing his wife. He {{took part in a}} high-school protest in Cienfuegos in November 1950, fighting with police in protest at the Education Ministry's ban on student associations; arrested and charged for violent conduct, the magistrate dismissed the charges. His hopes for Cuba still centered on Chibás and the Partido Ortodoxo, and he was present at Chibás' politically motivated suicide in 1951. Seeing himself as Chibás' heir, Castro wanted to run for Congress in the June 1952 elections, though senior Ortodoxo members feared his radical reputation and refused to nominate him. Instead he was nominated as a candidate for the House of Representatives by party members in Havana's poorest districts, and began campaigning.

5|$|Further medal {{success was}} {{anticipated}} at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, which were attended by 24 Australian athletes. Zali Steggall, who months earlier {{had become the}} first Australian woman to win a World Cup event and was ranked sixth in the world, won the country's first individual medal with a bronze in slalom skiing. Her time of 1m 32.67s was only 0.27s behind the gold medallist.

The first season averaged 8.05 million viewers, with a 2.6 rating among adults 18 to 49.|$|E
5|$|Silkies lay a {{fair number}} of eggs, of a cream color, but {{production}} is often interrupted due to their extreme tendency to go broody; a hen will produce 100 eggs in an ideal year. Their capacity for incubation, which has been selectively bred out of most fowl bred especially for egg production, is often exploited by poultry keepers by allowing Silkies to raise the offspring of other birds. In addition to being good mothers, Silkies are universally renowned for their calm, friendly temperament. They <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> confinement, and interact very well with children. This docility can cause Silkies to be bullied by more active or aggressive birds when kept in mixed flocks.|$|E
5|$|The Philadelphia Phillies' 2014 {{season was}} the 132nd {{in the history}} of the franchise.

Commensurate with this strategy, among their key acquisitions were right fielder Marlon Byrd and starting pitcher A. J. Burnett. The Phillies began the season with new coaches (as Ryne Sandberg entered his first season as manager after taking over on an interim basis in August 2013) and new broadcasters; Jamie Moyer and Matt Stairs, two members of the 2008 World Series squad, replaced Chris Wheeler and Gary Matthews as analysts on Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia.|$|E
