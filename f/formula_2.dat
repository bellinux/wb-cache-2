Still, the car - by now the AGS JH15 - was self-penned (by Vanderpleyn), self-built and self-run. <b>Formula</b> <b>2</b> was a difficult task for the small team, racing 1978 and 1979 without scoring any championship points. The early 1980s were somewhat better. AGS {{was one of the}} few teams who ran its own cars (Maurer, Minardi and Merzario were the others), and eventually the team was able to score points regularly. Soon some victories came, too. AGS made history when works driver Philippe Streiff won the final race of <b>Formula</b> <b>2</b> in 1984, using an AGS JH19C.|$|E

25|$|Descended from a Swiss-German grandfather, an Argentine {{father and}} an Italian mother, Reutemann {{was the first}} {{successful}} Argentine Formula One driver since the retirement of five-time World Champion Juan Manuel Fangio in 1958.

After racing touring cars and <b>Formula</b> <b>2</b> in Argentina, he moved to Europe in 1970 to drive a Brabham for the Automobile Club of Argentina Team in the European <b>Formula</b> <b>2</b> series. He immediately received attention when he took out Austrian Formula One driver Jochen Rindt (that year's eventual posthumous World Champion) on the first lap of his first race at Hockenheim, but carried on to finish fourth.

25|$|Lex Davison, who {{for several}} years would {{experiment}} with sports car engines in smaller <b>Formula</b> <b>2</b> chassis, took his first of four victories in a Jaguar engined <b>Formula</b> <b>2</b> HWM in 1954, while the previous year Whiteford won his third and final Grand Prix as {{for the first time}} racing cars thundered around the streets surrounding the Albert Park Lake in inner Melbourne. That circuit, which for four brief years gave Australia the strongest taste of the grandeur surrounding European Grand Prix racing, was 40 years later very much modified, used to host the 1996 Australian Grand Prix as the modern Formula One world championship venue. Jack Brabham took his first of three AGP wins in 1955 at the short Port Wakefield Circuit in South Australia. The race is significant in that Brabham was driving a Bristol powered Cooper T40, the first ever rear-engine car to win the Grand Prix.|$|E

25|$|In January 1967 Amon had {{returned}} home to New Zealand and Australia {{to compete in the}} 1968 Tasman Series which was used by many of the top Formula One drivers as a warm up series to the World Championship. Ferrari allowed him to race but refused to go to the expense of designing and building a car specifically for the Tasman Series which, unlike F1, had a maximum engine capacity of just 2.5-litres. Instead, Amon convinced Enzo Ferrari to allow him to use a Ferrari <b>Formula</b> <b>2</b> chassis fitted with a 2.4-litre V6 Dino engine.

The G-type was initially planned to run using a custom built ERA engine, but when funding became a problem the design was adapted to incorporate the popular Bristol straight-6 engine, also used with some success by Cooper, Frazer Nash and AC. However, engine modifications made by Hodkin resulted in engine failure in {{all three of the}} G-type's Grand Prix outings, despite being driven by rising star Stirling Moss. At the end of the 1952 season, out of money and in failing health, Johnson sold the project to the car manufacturing arm of the Bristol Aeroplane Company.|$|E
