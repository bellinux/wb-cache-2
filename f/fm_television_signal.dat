40|$|For just {{perceptible}} interference, an <b>FM</b> <b>television</b> <b>signal</b> {{interfering with}} another <b>FM</b> <b>television</b> <b>signal</b> {{must have an}} average signal power that is 26 to 37 db less than the wanted signal power. For an AM-VSB television signal interfering with an <b>FM</b> <b>television</b> <b>signal,</b> the AM-VSB television's sync peak average power must be 18 to 31 db below the FM television signal's average power. Also, when an <b>FM</b> <b>television</b> <b>signal</b> interferes with an AM-VSB signal, the average signal power of the FM signal should be 56 to 59 db below the sync peak average power of the AM-VSB television signal. The range of power ratios occur {{as a result of}} different TV scenes used in the tests and different FM-signal frequency deviations used. All tests were performed using 525 line, system M, color-television signals...|$|E
40|$|Results of {{subjective}} measurements made {{to determine the}} relationship between the image impairment grade and the wanted-signal to interference power ratios (C/I) for co-channel <b>FM</b> <b>television</b> <b>signals</b> are presented. The variation of C/I ratio with picture impairment grade is investigated for three different noise levels. The assessment of impairment grade due to thermal noise only and to picture content is also investigated. A statistical analysis for performed experiments is presented. The results presented here may be used by communication system designers to determine the required system characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Measured {{performance}} characteristics from ground {{test of the}} Transmitter Experiment Package (TEP) for the Communications Technology Satellite are presented. The experiment package consists of a 200 W Output Stage Tube (OST) powered by a Power Processing System (PPS). Descriptions of both the PPS and OST are given. The PPS provides the necessary voltages with a measured dc/dc conversion efficiency of 89 per cent. The OST, a traveling wave tube with multiple collectors, has a saturated rf output power of 224 W and operates at an overall efficiency exceeding 40 per cent over an 85 MHz bandwidth at 12 GHz. OST performance given includes frequency response, saturation characteristics, group delay, AM to PM conversion, intermodulation distortion, and two channel gain suppression. Single and dual channel FM video performance is presented. It was determined that for 12 MHz peak to peak frequency deviation on each channel, dual channel <b>FM</b> <b>television</b> <b>signals</b> can be transmitted through the TEP at 60 W, each channel, with 40 MHz channel spacing (center to center) ...|$|R
50|$|In 1935 a {{commission}} to produce an antenna with omnidirectional radiation, i.e. equal at all points of the compass, led him to develop the turnstile antenna, so-called because {{it looked like a}} turnstile. This offered an effective combination of high gain and broad bandwidth with a wave propagation pattern that made it possible to broadcast <b>FM</b> radio and <b>television</b> <b>signals</b> over long distances. To this design he later added an absorbing resistor which resulted in increased bandwidth and permitted the simultaneous radiation of television pictures and sound from the same antenna.|$|R
40|$|The Television Relay Using Small Terminals (TRUST) Experiment was {{designed}} to advance and promote the technology of broadcasting satellites. A constant envelope <b>television</b> <b>FM</b> <b>signal</b> was transmitted at C band to the ATS- 6 earth coverage horn and retransmitted at 860 MHz through the 9 -m antenna to a low-cost direct-readout ground station. The experiment demonstrated that high-quality television and audio can be received by low-cost direct-receive ground stations. Predetection bandwidths significantly less than predicted by Carson's rule can be utilized with minimal degradation of either monochrome or color pictures. Two separate techniques of dual audio channel transmission have been demonstrated to be suitable for low-cost applications...|$|R
25|$|Cable {{television}} {{is a system}} of broadcasting television programming to paying subscribers via radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted through coaxial cables or light pulses through fiber-optic cables. This contrasts with traditional terrestrial television, in which the <b>television</b> <b>signal</b> is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the <b>television.</b> <b>FM</b> radio programming, high-speed Internet, telephone service, and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables.|$|R
40|$|As {{the data}} rates {{required}} for digitally encoded television are reduced, satellite systems employing {{the transmission of}} digitally encoded television will become attractive. It is likely that television transmitted in this format will be adjacent to or in the same frequency band as television transmissions in other modulation formats, so a knowledge of carrier to interference power ratios {{as a function of}} assessed picture quality will be required for frequency sharing between these different modulation formats. This paper presents the results of subjective and quantitative tests describing the results of interference to a particular digital television system from a frequency modulated (<b>FM)</b> <b>television</b> system, and for interference to an <b>FM</b> <b>television</b> system from a digital television system...|$|R

5000|$|Line of sight: This {{refers to}} radio waves that travel in a {{straight}} line from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna. It does not necessarily require a cleared sight path; at lower frequencies radio waves can pass through buildings, foliage and other obstructions. This is the only method of propagation possible at microwave frequencies and above. On the surface of the Earth, line of sight propagation is limited by the visual horizon to about 64 km (40 mi). This is the method used by cell phones, <b>FM</b> and <b>television</b> broadcasting and radar. By using dish antennas to transmit beams of microwaves, point-to-point radio relay links transmit telephone and <b>television</b> <b>signals</b> over long distances up to the visual horizon, and ground stations can communicate with satellites and spacecraft billions of miles from Earth.|$|R
40|$|Efficient {{transmission}} of a wideband high-definition <b>television</b> <b>signal</b> involves data rate reduction. Three dimensional subsampling can be applied. In {{order to avoid}} aliasing when reconstructing the signal in the receiver, pre- and postfiltering is performed {{with respect to the}} sampling pattern. Motion adaptive filter accommodate the three dimensional spectrum of the <b>television</b> <b>signal</b> under consideration of the human visual system. The paper describes work on motion-detection in the postfilter. An algorithm for improved motion detection by applying three dimensional signal processing is presented. Thus the performance of the motion-detector and consequently the movement adaptive reconstruction of subsampled <b>television</b> <b>signals</b> have been significantly improved...|$|R
