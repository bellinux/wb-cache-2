5|$|A fossil site at a {{borrow pit}} in near Cheswold, Delaware created during highway {{construction}} unearthed 11 specimens of fragmentary and unassociated avian fossils, which {{were identified by}} Rasmussen as including a small loon, a small gull-like species and five specimens of a gannet-like seabird, probably Morus loxostylus, a common species in the Miocene. All of these <b>forms</b> <b>were</b> already known from a site in Chesapeake Bay, Maryland. The finds suggests that the Delaware site was the near-shore area of a large bay {{at the time of}} deposition.|$|E
5|$|In his 1982 monograph, Schodde {{proposed}} a southern origin {{for the common}} ancestor of the superb and splendid fairywrens. At {{some time in the}} past it was split into southwestern (splendid) and southeastern (superb) enclaves. As the southwest was drier than the southeast, once conditions were more favourable, the splendid <b>forms</b> <b>were</b> more able to spread into inland areas. In the east, the superb fairywren spread into Tasmania during a glacial period when the sea level was low and the island was connected {{with the rest of the}} continent via a land bridge. What gave rise to subspecies cyaneus became isolated as the sea levels rose. The Bass Strait <b>forms</b> <b>were</b> isolated from Tasmania but more recently and so their subspecific status was not maintained. Further molecular studies may result in this hypothesis being modified. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the ancestors of the superb and splendid fairywrens diverged from each other around 4 million years ago, and their common ancestor diverged around 7 million years ago from a lineage that gave rise to the white-shouldered, white-winged and red-backed fairywrens.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{scientists}} discovered several {{different forms of}} meats ants, forming the Iridomyrmex purpureus species group; three <b>forms</b> <b>were</b> identified (the regular I. purpureus {{and the other two}} forms I. sanguineus and I. viridiaeneus), differing in colour and nest structure. However, as there were no clear morphological differences among these variations, the taxonomic status and evolutionary relationship of these ants remained uncertain. Colouration varies from ants with a red head and thorax and a blue metallic sheen, to those with a yellowish body and a bluish-purple gaster. Others may be darker, appearing metallic-bluish to purplish-black. Owing to their different geographical ranges, the behaviour and ecology of these forms differentiated, based on examinations where multiple <b>forms</b> <b>were</b> sympatric. Each form had its own geographical limit, although the regular I. purpureus form is very common, inhabiting at least one-third of the Australian continent. Some forms may be dominant in certain habitats; for example, one form may be widespread throughout moist environments in dry areas, and others in cool and dry areas.|$|E

5|$|Most {{pterosaur}} skulls had elongated jaws with a {{full complement}} of needle-like teeth. In some cases, fossilized keratinous beak tissue has been preserved, though in toothed forms, the beak is small and restricted to the jaw tips and does not involve the teeth. Some advanced beaked <b>forms</b> <b>were</b> toothless, such as the pteranodonts and azhdarchids, and had larger, more extensive, and more bird-like beaks.|$|E
5|$|Several {{improvements}} {{were made}} to image filters and their theory of operation by Otto Zobel. Zobel coined the term constant k filter (or k-type filter) to distinguish Campbell's filter from later types, notably Zobel's m-derived filter (or m-type filter). The particular problems Zobel was trying to address with these new <b>forms</b> <b>were</b> impedance matching into the end terminations and improved steepness of roll-off. These were achieved {{at the cost of}} an increase in filter circuit complexity.|$|E

5|$|The largest Maya sculptures {{consisted}} of architectural façades crafted from stucco.

Finally, this was coated with stucco and moulded into the finished form; human body <b>forms</b> <b>were</b> first modelled in stucco, with their costumes added afterwards. The final stucco sculpture was then brightly painted. Giant stucco masks were used to adorn temple façades by the Late Preclassic, and such decoration continued into the Classic period.|$|E

5|$|Alexandre Baudrimont's 40-page study Vocabulaire de la langue des Bohémiens habitant {{les pays}} basques français of 1862, the most {{extensive}} of the early accounts, covers both vocabulary and aspects of grammar. He worked with two female informants, {{a mother and her}} daughter from the Uhart-Mixe area near Saint-Palais, whom he describes as highly fluent. Unfortunately, he was only able to conduct a single session as the women were then told not to cooperate further for the fear of outsiders prying into the secrets of the Romani. There is a certain degree of confusion in Baudrimont's publication—he himself states that he could not always be certain the correct <b>forms</b> <b>were</b> elicited. For example, most of the verb forms he tried to elicit lack the verbal -tu ending and appear to be participles.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the eight}} model plays {{eventually}} retained {{during that time}} were five Peking operas. Notable among these operas was The Legend of the Red Lantern, which was approved as a concert with piano accompaniment based on a suggestion from Jiang Qing. Performances of works beyond the eight model plays were allowed only in heavily modified form. The endings of many traditional plays were changed, and visible stage assistants in Peking opera were eliminated. After {{the end of the}} Cultural Revolution in the late 1970s, traditional Peking opera began to be performed again. Peking opera and other theatrical art <b>forms</b> <b>were</b> a controversial subject both before and during the Twelfth National People's Congress in 1982. A study carried in the People's Daily revealed that over 80 percent of musical dramas staged in the country were traditional plays from the pre-Communist era, as opposed to newly written historical dramas promoting socialist values. In response, Communist party officials enacted reforms to curb liberalism and foreign influence in theatrical works.|$|E
5|$|At independence, a King George V 5 pence {{registered}} {{envelope and}} 1 shilling telegram form were printed in green {{for use in}} Ireland until domestic products became available. Irish telegram <b>forms</b> <b>were</b> only produced in 1/- and 1/6 values. Registered envelopes have appeared in many values and sizes. The printed (but non-stamped) registered envelopes were produced by private firms and stored by the Irish post office until needed, so envelopes from former periods, showing out-dated fees in the text, often received an impressed stamp for the current postal rate, creating many subtypes for collectors. Other products have carried post-paid imprint, such as commemorative and special issue postcards, including a series of St. Patrick's Day cards issued annually since 1984.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{returned}} to work a week later, on , 2015. She said that, while she would not interfere with any deputy clerk who issues marriage licenses, she would not personally issue or authorize any of the forms. She created several altered versions of the Kentucky marriage license form and instructed her deputy clerks to use them, which had her name and reference to the clerk's office removed. The ACLU sued Davis separately for these form alterations, which they found to be of questionable legality. Governor Steve Beshear was asked by Bunning to brief the court on {{the validity of the}} licenses. Governor Beshear acknowledged that Kentucky would recognize the licenses being issued, but he could not verify the legality of the licenses issued or the means by which the marriage licenses were altered. Bunning ultimately denied the ACLU's separate suit, stating the altered <b>forms</b> <b>were</b> likely legal and that Davis was now abiding by the court's order.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, one species of the wildebeest, Connochaetes albojubatus, was {{identified}} in eastern Africa. In 1914, two separate races of the wildebeest were introduced, namely Gorgon a. albojubatus ("Athi white-bearded wildebeest") and G. a. mearnsi ("Loita white-bearded wildebeest"). However, in 1939, the two were once again merged into a single race, Connochaetes taurinus albojubatus. In the mid-twentieth century, two separate <b>forms</b> <b>were</b> recognised, Gorgon taurinus hecki and G. t. albojubatus. Finally two distinct types of wildebeest – the blue and black wildebeest – were identified. The blue wildebeest was at first placed under a separate genus, Gorgon, while the black wildebeest belonged to the genus Connochaetes. Today they are united in the single genus Connochaetes: the black wildebeest being named (C. gnou) and the blue wildebeest, (C. taurinus).|$|E
5|$|Ironically, the {{original}} specimen {{was of the}} black-plumaged subspecies from Dirk Hartog Island, which was not recorded again for 80years. Meanwhile, the widespread blue-plumaged subspecies was discovered and described as two separate species by John Gould in 1865. He called one specimen collected from inland New South Wales the white-winged superb warbler, M. cyanotus, while another, which appeared to have a white back and wings, was described as M. leuconotus, the white-backed superb warbler. It {{was not until the}} early 20th century that both of these blue-plumaged mainland <b>forms</b> <b>were</b> found to be of a single species. George Mack, ornithologist of the National Museum of Victoria, considered the specific name leuconotus to take precedence in his 1934 revision of the genus, and more recent studies have followed suit. The back region between the shoulders is in fact bare, with feathers that arise from the shoulder (scapular) region and sweep inwards in different patterns. This variation confused the early naturalists who described the white-backed and blue-backed species.|$|E
5|$|Nationally {{important}} deities {{gave rise}} to local manifestations, which sometimes absorbed the characteristics of older regional gods. Horus had many forms tied to particular places, including Horus of Nekhen, Horus of Buhen, and Horus of Edfu. Such local manifestations could be treated almost as separate beings. During the New Kingdom, one man was accused of stealing clothes by an oracle supposed to communicate messages from Amun of Pe-Khenty. He consulted two other local oracles of Amun hoping for a different judgment. Gods' manifestations also differed according to their roles. Horus could be a powerful sky god or vulnerable child, and these <b>forms</b> <b>were</b> sometimes counted as independent deities.|$|E

5|$|Several {{species and}} <b>forms</b> <b>were</b> {{described}} before 1800, {{most of them}} with inadequate locality data. At least two names — Amphidromus laevus (Müller, 1774) and the form A. perversus f. aureus Martyn, 1784 — still (as of 2017) {{have not yet been}} reported from a precise locality. During {{the first half of the}} nineteenth century, many species and varieties were named, again usually with poor locality data. Not until Eduard von Martens (1867) published his monograph was there an attempt to cover the entire complex of species within this genus. The 1867 monograph contained considerable information both on the variation within the genus, and on the problems of the geographic distribution of the species. Many concepts that originated with von Martens are still (as of 2017) in use.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian, chestnut-vented, Kashmir and chestnut-bellied nuthatches form another {{superspecies}} {{and replace}} each other geographically across Asia. They are currently {{considered to be}} four separate species, but the south-Asian <b>forms</b> <b>were</b> once {{believed to be a}} subspecies of the Eurasian nuthatch. A recent change in this taxonomy is a split of the chestnut-bellied nuthatch into three species, namely the Indian nuthatch, Sitta castanea, found south of the Ganges, the Burmese nuthatch, Sitta neglecta, found in southeast Asia, and the chestnut-bellied nuthatch sensu stricto, S. cinnamoventris, which occurs in the Himalayas. Mitochondrial DNA studies have demonstrated that the white-breasted northern subspecies of Eurasian nuthatch, S. (europea) arctica, is distinctive, and also a possible candidate for full species status. This split has been accepted by the British Ornithologists' Union.|$|E
