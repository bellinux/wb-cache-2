5|$|It is {{possible}} that Leggetts Creek sometimes exceeds its total maximum daily load, especially during low <b>flow</b> <b>conditions</b> and the summer months. There are some mine drainage issues on the creek between Rockwell Avenue and Charles Street. It experiences some flow loss to underground mine voids. In 1978, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (now known as the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection) estimated that the creek lost 20 to 30 percent of its flow to mines during dry weather. However, the creek is large enough that this does not cause aquatic habitat to be lost. The Chinchilla sewage treatment plant discharges into the creek {{in the vicinity of}} Leggetts Gap. In its lower reaches, the creek is impacted by past mining, urban development, and debris. Stormwater also flows into the Lackawanna River via the creek and it is affected by fine sediment. There is one stormwater detention facility in the watershed, at Leggett's Creek Estates.|$|E

40|$|Staphylococcus biofilm {{exhibits}} high {{antibiotic resistance}} and therapeutic doses of antibiotics are often sub-inhibitory. Whereas {{data are available}} on the effect of sub-inhibitory antibiotics on matrix formation, little is known on their influence on biofilm population. Here, using BioTimer Assay (BTA), a method developed to quantify biofilm population, the influence of sub-inhibitory gentamicin, ofloxacin and azithromycin on Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 biofilm population in flow with respect to static condition was assessed. Antibiotics and <b>flow</b> <b>condition</b> increased biofilm population even if at different extent, depending on the antibiotic molecule. The greatest bacterial population was found in biofilm developed under <b>flow</b> <b>condition</b> in the presence of azithromycin. A significant increase in biofilm matrix was recorded for biofilm developed in the presence of antibiotics in flow with respect to static condition. The growth rates (GRs) of 24 -h biofilm developed under the influence of antibiotics and <b>flow</b> <b>condition</b> were also evaluated using BTA and a specific mathematical model. Antibiotics and <b>flow</b> <b>condition</b> affected the GRs of 24 -h biofilm even if at different extent. The lowest GR value was recorded for biofilm developed under <b>flow</b> <b>condition</b> in the presence of ofloxacin. Although further studies are needed, our data indicate that antibiotics and <b>flow</b> <b>condition</b> influenced biofilm development by increasing both bacterial population and matrix formation and affected the GRs of the developed biofilm. To the best of our knowledge, BTA is unique in allowing the calculation of the GRs of biofilm and it may be considered to be a useful study model to evaluate the activity of antibiofilm molecules.

5|$|Spring Brook {{experiences}} noticeable flow loss. As of 2009, it {{has high}} levels of sodium and alkalinity. Pittson Township and the borough of Moosic have permits to discharge stormwater into it. However, the water quality and habitat quality of the stream are relatively unimpacted. The stream has relatively high water quality even where it flows through a concrete channel. In {{a study by the}} Susquehanna River Basin Commission, it was found not to fail any water quality standards either during base flow or storm <b>flow</b> <b>conditions.</b> However, a study from the previous year found concentrations of sodium and alkalinity exceeding the threshold for concern. In the early 1900s, Spring Brook was a clear stream in its upper reaches. However, by the time it reached the property of the Du Pont Powder Company, it was affected by slush pumped into it by the Pennsylvania Coal Company.|$|E

40|$|Mini {{centrifugal}} pumps having a diameter smaller than 100 mm {{are employed in}} many fields. But the design method for the mini centrifugal pump is not established because the internal <b>flow</b> <b>condition</b> for these small-sized fluid machines is not clarified and conventional theory is not suitable for small-sized pumps. Therefore, mini {{centrifugal pumps}} with simple structure were investigated by this research. Splitter blades were adopted in this research to improve the performance and the internal <b>flow</b> <b>condition</b> of mini centrifugal pump which had large blade outlet angle. The original impeller without the splitter blades and the impeller with the splitter blades were prepared for an experiment. The performance tests are conducted with these rotors in order to investigate {{the effect of the}} splitter blades on performance and internal <b>flow</b> <b>condition</b> of mini centrifugal pump. On the other hand, a three dimensional steady numerical flow analysis is conducted with the commercial code (ANSYS-CFX) to investigate the internal <b>flow</b> <b>condition</b> in detail. It is clarified from experimental results that the performance of the mini centrifugal pump is improved by the effect of the splitter blades. Blade-to-blade low velocity regions are suppressed in the case with the splitter blades and total pressure loss regions are decreased. The effects of the splitter blades on the performance and the internal <b>flow</b> <b>condition</b> are discussed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{we examine}} realizations of no-normal <b>flow</b> {{boundary}} <b>conditions</b> on curved boundaries for discontinu-ous Galerkin (DG) solutions to channel problems governed by two-dimensional shallow water equations (SWE). Two approaches, {{both of which}} use a straight-sided-element mesh, are considered. The first approach, which is commonly used, consists simply of imposing the no-normal <b>flow</b> <b>condition</b> directly on the boundary of a straight-sided-element mesh. The second approach is a so-called curvature boundary condition which approximates a no-normal flow con-dition on the physical curved wall. Numerical solutions to sub-critical flow in a converging-diverging channel clearly indicate that, as in gas dynamics, a proper treatment of the no-normal <b>flow</b> <b>condition</b> on curved walls is crucial for an accurate DG solution to the SWE. In the test problem, errors introduced through the straightforward application of the no-normal <b>flow</b> <b>condition</b> on the linear approximation of curved walls result in artificial boundary layers in the velocity field and a corresponding over-prediction of the surface elevation in the upstream direction. These significant inaccuracies appear in flow problems without or with a lateral momentum diffusion term and in all DG schemes em-ployed including those using linear, quadratic, and cubic DG polynomials, and both the local Lax-Friedrichs and Roe numerical fluxes...|$|R
40|$|Bubble-particle {{encounter}} {{interaction is}} the first step of the particle collection by rising air bubbles in flotation and has been predicted based on the potential <b>flow</b> <b>condition</b> by Sutherland and others, leading to the approximate generalised Sutherland equation (GSE). In this paper, the bubble-particle encounter interaction with the potential <b>flow</b> <b>condition</b> has been analysed by solving the full motion equation for the particle employing a numerical computational approach. Together with other inertial forces, the gravitational forces were fully included in the motion equation. The numerical results were compared with the GSE models for the encounter efficiency. The effect of particle density on the encounter interaction was very significant and could counterbalance the "negative" effect of the inertial forces on the particle interaction with air bubbles with a mobile surface under the potential <b>flow</b> <b>condition.</b> For the typical particle size range used in flotation, significant deviation of the Sutherland approximate models from the numerical results due to the particle density effect and gravitational forces was observed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
