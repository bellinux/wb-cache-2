5|$|On release, Contact Harvest {{reached a}} top spot of #3 on the New York Times bestseller list, where it {{remained}} for four weeks. The novel also {{appeared on the}} USA Today bestsellers list at the same time. Reviewers noted that despite being an unproven writer, Staten <b>had</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> crafting an excellent novel. The novel's success {{was considered to be}} evidence that games were breaking into the mainstream, and that the genre was becoming increasingly about the story.|$|E

5|$|After the battle, the {{captured}} German panzerarmee general Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma told Montgomery {{that he had}} believed the allies {{had at least one}} more armoured division than they did, and that the attack would be in the south. Rommel's stand-in, general Georg Stumme, thought the attack would not begin for several weeks. German documents and prisoners of war confirmed that the German commanders had believed in the existence of the decoy unit, and had not anticipated the true avenue of attack. Bertram <b>had</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> all its objectives.|$|E
5|$|Before 1932, the Cipher Bureau <b>had</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> solving {{an earlier}} Enigma machine that functioned without a plugboard, {{but had been}} {{unsuccessful}} with the Enigma I, a new standard German cipher machine that was coming into widespread use. In late October or early November 1932, {{the head of the}} Cipher Bureau's German section, Captain Maksymilian Ciężki, tasked Rejewski to work alone on the German Enigma I machine {{for a couple of hours}} per day; Rejewski was not to tell his colleagues what he was doing.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{significantly}} underestimating {{the size}} of the position they faced, the Australians <b>had</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> the pushing D445 VC Battalion and 3/33 NVA Regiment out of a valuable base area intended for long-term use. Regardless, there were few other tangible results to show for the casualties they had incurred as, although numerous blood trails and body parts scattered around the battlefield indicated that communist casualties had been heavy, the majority of their dead had either been removed from the battlefield or were entombed in the bunkers that had been crushed by the Australian tanks. The battle had cost the Australians three killed and six wounded, while only five Viet Cong bodies were recovered.|$|E

5|$|Having taken heavy {{casualties}} and losing strategic superiority, Burbridge {{and his men}} conducted a disorganized withdrawal. The Confederates <b>had</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> holding the rail breastworks, yet had expended most of their ammunition in doing so. Each Confederate infantryman had fired at least seventy-five rounds, with some firing significantly more. The Union commanders then ordered another charge with a cavalry regiment that reinforced the Union infantry. The unexpected fighting capabilities of the small Confederate force had temporarily created a reprieve for the salt works.|$|E
5|$|In 281 BC, at {{the request}} of the Greek city of Tarentum, Pyrrhus, the King of the Greek state of Epirus, went with an army of 25,500 men and 20 {{elephants}} to Italy to help fight the Romans. The Romans <b>had</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> conquering most of Italy and were now moving in to take the Greek cities in Magna Graecia. After arriving in Italy in 280 BC, Pyrrhus defeated a Roman army at the Battle of Heraclea, near Tarentum. Pyrrhus repeated his success against Romans by defeating another army at the Battle of Asculum.|$|E
5|$|She was {{assigned}} {{to try to stop}} the MTV Movie Awards from featuring a South Park satire which poked fun at Scientology and the film based on a book by its founder L. Ron Hubbard, titled Battlefield Earth. Christman repeatedly called the New York City office of MTV in an attempt to get them to stop the satire from airing. In the eventual broadcast, which ran June 8, 2000, the South Park character Cartman was shown using a Scientology personality test as toilet paper. Christman believed she <b>had</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> her mission, for she thought that her efforts prevented the book Dianetics from being used by Cartman, instead of the personality test.|$|E

5|$|The Swiss did {{not accept}} these resolutions of the Imperial Diet, and they {{explicitly}} refused to pay the common penny. They had no interest whatsoever in sending troops to serve in an army under Habsburg authority, nor in paying taxes, nor would they accept any foreign court's jurisdiction; and they <b>had</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> securing public peace within their territories reasonably well by themselves. They simply considered the whole proposal a curtailing of their freedom. The Swiss were by far not the only members of the empire who {{refused to accept the}} resolutions, but Maximilian would use their refusal later as a pretext to place the Swiss Confederacy under an imperial ban (Reichsacht).|$|E
5|$|The first Persian {{invasion}} was {{a response}} to Greek involvement in the Ionian Revolt, when the Eretrians and Athenians had sent a force to support the cities of Ionia in their attempt to overthrow Persian rule. The Eretrian and Athenian force <b>had</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> capturing and burning Sardis (the regional capital of Persia), but was then forced to retreat with heavy losses. In response to this raid, the Persian king Darius I swore to have revenge on Athens and Eretria.|$|E
5|$|The new President invited several Liberals to {{join the}} Conservative ranks and {{went so far as}} to name some as ministers. One of these was Paranhos, who took the Foreign Affairs portfolio. He was still in Montevideo when he learned that Carneiro Leão <b>had</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> having him elected a general deputy in 1853. The new cabinet, albeit highly successful, was plagued from the {{beginning}} by strong opposition from Conservative Party members who repudiated the new recruits from the Liberal side, believing that these did not truly share the party's ideals and were mainly interested in gaining public offices. Despite the mistrust, Carneiro Leão demonstrated great resilience in fending off threats and overcoming obstacles and setbacks.|$|E

5|$|Caracalla {{was born}} in Lugdunum, Gaul (now Lyon, France), on 4April 188 to Septimius Severus and Julia Domna. He had a {{slightly}} younger brother, Geta, who would briefly rule as co-emperor alongside him. Caracalla's father, Septimius Severus, appointed Caracalla joint Augustus and full emperor from the year 198 onwards. His brother Geta was granted the same title in 210. In 202 Caracalla was forced to marry the daughter of Gaius Fulvius Plautianus, Fulvia Plautilla, a woman whom he hated, though for what reason is unknown. By 205 Caracalla <b>had</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> having Plautianus executed for treason, though he had probably fabricated {{the evidence of the}} plot himself. It was then that he banished his wife, whose later killing might have been carried out under Caracalla's orders.|$|E
5|$|Ganteaume's expeditions of 1801 {{were three}} {{connected}} major French Navy {{operations of the}} spring of 1801 during the French Revolutionary Wars. A French naval squadron from Brest under Contre-amiral Honoré Ganteaume, seeking to reinforce the besieged French garrison in Egypt, made three separate but futile efforts to reach the Eastern Mediterranean. The French army in Egypt had been trapped there shortly {{after the start of}} the Napoleonic campaign in Egypt in 1798, when the French Mediterranean Fleet was destroyed at the Battle of the Nile. Since that defeat, the French Navy had maintained only a minimal presence in the Mediterranean Sea, while the more numerous British and their allies <b>had</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> blockading and defeating several French bases almost unopposed.|$|E
5|$|Hansen soon finds Bakharev, {{who tells}} him that to disable the radio jammer around the rig so he can contact Bennett, he will need Anischenko to get him past a retinal scanner. Bakharev is then dragged into an air duct and killed. Hansen learns that Kamsky and Bakharev were under orders to make the exocels as {{dangerous}} as possible, which they <b>had</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> doing, but without any way to control the resulting creatures. Hansen finds and kills Anischenko, removing his eye and using it to deactivate the radio jammer. Once {{back in touch with}} Bennett, Hansen is told he must find Kamsky's laptop and transmit the exocel research. Meanwhile, Anna is rescued from the sea by a large creature and left in a lab, where she is infected by an exocel. Seeing this take place on a security monitor, Hansen races to the lab to give Anna the antidote.|$|E

5|$|Historian Ramsay Weston Phipps {{believed}} that Charles might have remained along the Rhine and defeated the French armies {{one after the}} other. Unlike the divided command of the French, the Austrians enjoyed unity of command. After Ettlingen, Phipps thought that the correct French strategy was for the two French armies to join. However, this {{was not part of}} Carnot's plan, which was for each army to operate against the Austrian flanks. Carnot's strategy <b>had</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> 1794 during the Flanders Campaign and he expected that it would win again. However, in 1794 the Coalition was made up of several countries with different vulnerabilities, while in 1796 Charles could issue a command and expect it to be obeyed. The next clash would be the Battle of Neresheim on 11 August.|$|E
5|$|In 1602 Frederico Spinola, {{younger brother}} of Ambrogio Spinola had {{distinguished}} himself greatly {{as a soldier}} in the Army of Flanders and <b>had</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> 1599 going through the English Channel passing the straits of Dover unmolested; this led to a panic called the Invisible armada as it encouraged suspicions that the attempt might be renewed and on a larger scale. Buoyed by this achievement he had indulged Philip III of Spain, the Duke of Lerma and Martín de Padilla in a vision of a massive galley-borne invasion of England from Flanders. However the council brought him down to a mere eight galleys, provided at Spinola's expense. He was on his way from San Lucar to Lisbon but he was defeated by Sir Richard Leveson at Sezimbra Bay which cost him two galleys.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Rutherford <b>had</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> {{disintegrating}} nitrogen atoms with alpha particles {{emitted from}} decaying radium atoms. This and subsequent experiments hinted at {{the structure of}} atomic nuclei. To explore it further, he needed an artificial means of creating particles with a velocity high enough to overcome the charge of the nucleus. This opened {{a new line of}} research at the Cavendish Laboratory. He assigned Cockcroft, Thomas Allibone and Ernest Walton to the problem. They built what became known as a Cockcroft–Walton accelerator. Mark Oliphant designed a proton source for them. A crucial moment came when Cockcroft read a paper by George Gamow on quantum tunnelling. Cockcroft realised {{that as a result of}} this phenomenon, the desired effect could be achieved with much lower voltages than first thought. In fact, he calculated that protons with energy of just 300,000 electronvolts would be able to penetrate a boron nucleus. Cockcroft and Walton worked on their accelerator for the next two years. Rutherford obtained a £1,000 grant from the University of Cambridge for them to buy a transformer and other equipment they needed.|$|E
