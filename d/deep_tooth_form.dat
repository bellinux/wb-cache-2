40|$|The {{effect of}} load speed on {{straight}} and involute <b>tooth</b> <b>forms</b> is studied using several finite-element models. It is {{found that for}} rapidly rotating gears and sprockets, the load speed along the tooth surface can significantly affect the tooth vibration. Indeed, {{it is found that}} for sufficiently high load speeds and for sufficiently slender <b>tooth</b> <b>forms,</b> the <b>tooth</b> deflection can, at times, be directed opposite to the load direction. Comparisons are made of various dynamic models of gear and sprocket teeth. It is shown that for stubby <b>tooth</b> <b>forms</b> there is considerable difference between results obtained with finite element models and results obtained with Timoshenko beam models. Finally, it is shown that gear or sprocket vibrations can be induced by the shape of the <b>tooth</b> <b>form</b> itself. This effect becomes increasingly significant at higher speeds...|$|R

Current collector was used to test the dynamic tension when straight sprocket and involute sprocket engaged with the same silent chain.

40|$|Abstract. The {{proportional}} modification {{parameters are}} useful for compensating the <b>tooth</b> <b>form</b> errors of spiral bevel gears. Based on the mathematical model for calculating the machine setting parameters {{and according to the}} relative position relationship between cutter and workpiece, the formulae for calculating the second-order proportional modification parameters for gears manufactured by spread blade method was deduced by the curvature and normal vector at calculation point. The proportional modification parameters can make the lengthwise curvature or profile curvature or lengthwise twist curvature of the concave and convex flank produce uniform change or difference change. The formulae is verified by experiment on CNC spiral bevel gear grinding machine and M&M sigma 7 gear measuring center. Preface In order to ensure the transmission quality and realize interchangeability of spiral bevel gears, the practical <b>tooth</b> <b>form</b> should be equal to the theoretical <b>tooth</b> <b>form</b> approximately. The method listed in literature [1 - 8] for modifying <b>tooth</b> <b>form</b> errors is not effectual for gears manufactured by spread blade method. Literature [9] puts forward a new modification method based on proportional modification parameters and it can realize the modification of <b>tooth</b> <b>form</b> errors of the pinion generated by single side method. This method is also available for gears generated by spread blade method. However, the current machine settings summary only provides the proportional modification parameters for pinion. Consequently, in order to apply this modification method to modify the <b>tooth</b> <b>form</b> errors of gears generated by spread blade method, this paper will deduce the formulae for calculating the second-order proportional modification parameters based on mathematical model for calculating machine setting parameters and verify these formulae by experiment...|$|R
