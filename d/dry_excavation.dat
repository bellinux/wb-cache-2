40|$|CHANGES IN SUBSURFACE WATER QUALITY DURING COASTAL CANAL ESTATE CONSTRUCTIONS Gurudeo A. Tularam 1 and Julian Dobos 2 1 Lecturer and 2 Postgraduate student, Faculty of Environmental Sciences, Griffith University, Brisbane Australia ABSTRACT Construction {{of coastal}} canal estates has {{increased}} in recent times in Australia. The lowering of the watertable is required during certain canal construction periods. Coastal low lands contain can contain pyrites and associated potential acid sulfate soils. Dewatering or lowering of the water table to allow for <b>dry</b> <b>excavation,</b> may permit oxidation of the pyritic soil causing acid generation. Saline intrusion may also occur via lowering of the watertable. A paucity of literature on coastal canal estates led to this study, which investigated the subsurface water quality during construction of a canal estate. Groundwater depth, pH, dissolved oxygen, titrated acidity and salinity were monitored on site at the Lake Kawana development in Queensland, Australia. Groundwater monitoring was carried out before, {{during and after the}} dewatering program. Data analysis showed that water depth increased during dewatering activities and decreased after re-flooding. The dissolved oxygen, titrated acidity and salinity levels rose during periods of increased groundwater depth, while pH levels fell. The increase in oxygen availability and the associated increase in acidity, may lead to dissolution of heavy metals, but monitoring data was lacking in this regard. Since salinity may increase due to other close by saline surface water bodies, further studies are required to understand subsurface flow patterns during dewatering operations. Computer simulation models could be developed to help determine the flow of contaminants during dewatering and re-flooding operations.

40|$|The {{construction}} of a dam significantly modifies the flow conditions of natural streams inside and downstream of an artificial lake. One of the major consequences of this change is the progressive reduction of the hydraulic capacity in the alluvial beds, which have the tendency to congest. With the aim of keeping the evacuation potential of the natural hydraulic network for spillway operations during floods, the watercourses need to be maintained either by dredging or by regular flushing. The surface erosion in the catchment area leads to reservoir sedimentation that cannot be tolerated without restrictions, because it will affect {{the safety of the}} dam and cause damage to the hydraulic structures, in particular to the turbines. In addition, the accumulation of alluvial deposits induces an unrelenting reduction of the storage capacity. In consequence the accumulated material has to be evacuated regularly. All classical methods such as flushing, <b>dry</b> or humid <b>excavation,</b> pumping, etc. can be applied to this effect. These operations have to be carried out taking into account eventual consequences on the security of human life, possession, and on the natural environment. The accompanying measures need to attain the objective of reproducing conditions as natural as possible, particularly in comparison with flood events. The legal bases and the resulting constraints are reviewed. Their application by the Cantonal Authorities is discussed in a general way...|$|R
40|$|Climatic {{impacts of}} energy-peat {{extraction}} are of increasing concern due to EU emissions trading requirements.

To quantify and compare the soil GHG fluxes of the <b>excavation</b> <b>drier</b> and the traditional milling methods, {{as well as the}} areas from which the energy peat is planned to be extracted in the future (extraction reserve area types), soil CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O fluxes were measured during 2006 – 2007 at three sites in Finland. Within each site, fluxes were measured from drained extraction reserve areas, extraction fields and stockpiles of both methods and additionally from the biomass driers of the excavation-drier method. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), described at a principal level in ISO Standards 14040 : 2006 and 14044 : 2006, was used to assess the long-term (100 years) climatic impact from peatland utilisation with respect to land use and energy production chains where utilisation of coal was replaced with peat. Coal was used as a reference since in many cases peat and coal can replace each other in same power plants. According to this study, the peat extraction method used was of lesser significance than the extraction reserve area type in regards to the climatic impact. However, the excavation-drier method seems to cause a slightly reduced climatic impact as compared with the prevailing milling method. Publishers versio...|$|R
40|$|Canal estates are housing {{developments}} in coastal lowlands. A recent {{increase in the}} number of canal estates has been noted in the Australian coastline. Such developments almost always cause the lowering of the watertable for some period oftime, as required during construction periods. Many ofthe Australian coastal lowlands contain pyrites that cause acid pollution upon oxidation. The lowering of the water table to allow for <b>dry</b> <b>excavation</b> constructions may lead to the oxidation of the pyritic soils producing acid in the soil matrix. Also, the dredging and bringing of acidic material to the surface lead to surface water pollution downstream. Moreover, being close a large store of sea water, intrusion of saline water may also occur due the imbalance of subsurface fresh and salty waters dynamics. At present, there is lack of literature on coastal canal estates and the paucity led to this study, which investigated the subsurface water quality during construction of a canal estate in North Brisbane in Queensland. Groundwater depth, pH, dissolved oxygen, titrated acidity and salinity were monitored on site at the Lake Kawana development. Groundwater monitoring was carried out before, during and after the dewaterinll program. As expected the data analysis showed that the water level decreased during dewatering activities and increased after re-flooding. The dissolved oxygen, titrated acidity and salinity levels rose during periods of increased groundwater depth, while pH levels fell. The increase in oxygen availability and the associated increase in acidity, may lead to dissolution of heavy metals, but monitoring data was lacking in this regard. Since salinity may increase due to other close by saline surface water bodies such as a tidal affected river, further studies are required to understand subsurface flow patterns during dewatering operations.

40|$|In {{geotechnical}} practice frequently use is made {{of steel}} sheet pile walls for soil and/or water retaining constructions. High demands are made {{with respect to the}} deformations, in particular in urban surroundings. Often these walls are composed of V- or Z-shaped profiles, whereby both profiles have their specific advantages and disadvantages. A common used variant is a sheet pile wall composed of so called double If-profiles. A double If-profile is made up of two single U-profiles which are connected by welding or crimping. A very specific property of the double If-profile is the rotation of the neutral axis. As a result of that, the sheet pile wall tends to deflect both in forward (lateral) direction as well as in sideway (transverse) direction. This phenomenon is called oblique bending, and it results in a loss of stiffness and strength (compared to a continuous wall) and thus larger deformations. Oblique bending goes together with slip in the free interlocks and a transverse deflection of the sheet pile wall relative to the soil body. Oblique bending might be influenced by the transverse bearing capacity of the soil, i. e. the soil reduces or even prevents the transverse deformation of the sheet pile. Besides, the shear stress in the free interlock possibly reduces oblique bending. The main goal {{of this study is to}} determine the transverse bearing capacity of the soil. Therefore a three dimensional finite element model {{is made of}} a cantilever sheet pile wall with a <b>dry</b> <b>excavation</b> in front and without friction in the sliding interlocks. This is a 'worst case' model, i. e. if a sheet pile wall is modelled in this way, oblique bending can be observed most clearly. Emphasis has been put on the generation of an appropriate mesh which is also useful for further investigations regarding oblique bending. Use is made of the finite element system DIANA, version 6. 1.

40|$|Because of the {{increase}} of safety requirements with respect to storage of LPG over the last ten years, underground storage is becoming increasingly significant. Storage is possible in engineering geological and in civil engineering constructions. The main features of these two solutions are presented. LPG can be stored either pressurized or refrigerated. This report concerns the pressurized storage in a civil construction. In mounded storage a horizontal cylindrical steel vessel is covered with sand. The normal mounded storage has some disadvantages which can be solved by partly submerging the vessel in the groundwater. This mode of storage is called mounded storage with a floating foundation. It is expected that using this method the differential settlements of the vessel will be smaller. Also {{the height of the}} mound will be smaller. A layer of sand on top of the vessel will prevent it from floating up. For some various sizes and shapes of the vessel the required thickness of this layer is calculated. In this report {{on the basis of a}} few criteria for the depth of the excavation and the length of the vessel the best alternative is chosen. For the chosen vessel the wall thicknesses are calculated and checked following the British Standard Specification for fusion-welded pressure vessels (BS 5500). A partly submerged vessel needs a coating and a cathodic protection system to prevent it from corroding. Exact the same coating and cathodic protection used for the normal mounded storage, can be used for the mounded storage with a floating foundation. The vessels will be shop-built in a tent close to their foundation. The foundation will be built in a <b>dry</b> <b>excavation.</b> With cranes the vessels will be put on their foundation. When the vessel is partly submerged the potential longitudinal bending moment in the vessel will be less. The differential settlement will be smaller but this does not effect the wall thicknesses since the dry situation is mandatory for the calculation of these sizes. The mounded storage with a floating foundation will be less expensive than storage in spheres, but more expensive than the normal mounded storage. However, other reasons than cost could perhaps make the mounded storage with a floating foundation a preferable storage method. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|For {{over three}} {{quarters}} of a century steel sheet pile walls are applied in geotechnical practice. For example in quay walls and construction pits in urban surroundings. Steel sheet pile walls are often composed of so called double U-profiles. These profiles consist of two single U profiles fixed in the common interlock by welding or crimping. A very specific property of the double U-profile is an asymmetric cross-section which can lead to a rotation of the neutral axis. As a result of this, the sheet pile wall tends to deflect both forward (lateral) and sideways (transverse). This phenomenon is called oblique bending. As a result of oblique bending, the strength and lateral stiffness of the sheet pile wall may be decreased considerably up to values of 60 % to 70 % compared to a continuous sheet pile wall. This leads to uneconomical designs. Four different methods to reduce oblique bending in a steel sheet pile wall have been studied: 1) Cantilever sheet pile wall in dry sand. 2) Cantilever steel sheet pile wall with a fix of the horizontal displacement at the top. 3) Cantilever steel sheet pile wall with a capping beam on top. 4) Cantilever steel sheet pile with the sliding interlock welded during the excavation. The main goal {{of this study is to}} determine which method is able to give the highest resistance against oblique bending. Therefore calculations have been made with a 3 D-finite element model (DIANA) of a <b>dry</b> <b>excavation</b> of a sand body in front of a cantilever sheet pile wall consisting of double U-profiles. The lower limit of the strength and stiffness is obtained when no transverse bending moment is activated and the in plane deformation is free. The maximum or upper limit strength and stiffness is derived if oblique bending is prevented by fixing the free interlocks (no in plane deformation). Depending on the loading conditions, the stiffness varies from 0. 49 to 1 time the maximum stiffness. The strength appeared to vary from 0. 59 to 1 time the maximum strength. 3 D-finite element calculations have been made for the mentioned four methods to reduce oblique bending. From the 3 D calculations it followed that the use of these methods may increase the strength and stiffness up to about 0. 8 times the maximum value for strength and stiffness. Welding of the interlock during excavation gave the highest reduction of oblique bending. Foundation Engineering GroupHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the use of}} 3 D finite element method (FEM) in deep excavations, especially the simulation of sequential excavation method in 3 D FEM model. It is an independent research project based on the Spaarndammertunnel project in Amsterdam. This thesis only focused on the excavation part of the tunnel project. Soil parameters used in models were derived from in situ soil investigation. Cone penetration tests and boreholes were carried out along the tunnel location. The soil data was compared with Amsterdam North-South metro line database as well. The excavation plan, retaining structure and building material were developed from the preliminary design of this project. The data for soil investigation and preliminary design were provided by CRUX Engineering BV. The research focus {{was to investigate the}} advantages and disadvantages of applying 3 D FEM modelling for deep excavations. Since the construction of Spaarndammertunnel starts after the completion of this graduation project, no field data was available for verification. Instead, 2 D models were made for comparison and verification purpose. The soil and building material parameters were first tested in 2 D spring model and 2 D FEM model. The deflections of sheet pile walls in both 2 D models were at similar level. The 3 D FEM model adopted the model set-up tested and adjusted in 2 D FEM model. Parametric study was done in order to investigate how the domain and mesh set-up influence the results in 3 D FEM model. Certain geometry (50 m * 18 m) of excavation section was determined so that the results from 3 D FEM model and 2 D FEM model were comparable. The excavation method applied in 2 D and 3 D FEM model was normal staged excavation. The excavation was designed to be <b>dry</b> <b>excavation.</b> After the comparison between 2 D and 3 D FEM model, the sequential excavation method was implemented into 3 D FEM model. Different excavation rates, excavation directions and lateral support design were tested in order to optimize the sequential excavation model. The responses of sheet pile walls as well as surrounding soil were recorded and compared with results from normal 3 D excavation model. The parametric study of 3 D FEM model showed that the geometry of the excavation zone and the mesh set-up has great influence over the response of sheet pile wall. If the excavation section was longer than 50 m, the whole domain can be considered as plain strain, so that the results in 2 D and 3 D FEM models were almost the same. If the section length was lowered from 50 m to 30 m, the bending of sheet pile wall could be reduced by 20 %. This is because the sheet pile wall can benefit from the corner effect in 3 D scenario. It is advised to apply 3 D FEM model when dimensions and shape of the excavation zone allows the model to maximize the corner effect. The mesh set-up is also crucial to 3 D FEM model. Coarse mesh leads to low accuracy results that certain stress points receiving much high stress than it should. Refine mesh requires a lot more time for calculation. For future research, it is still advised to perform field test for verification of 3 D FEM models. It is also recommended to test how lateral support like struts and wailing beam influence the performance of sheet pile wall, especially the corners of excavation section. For the sequential excavation method in this project, the main benefit was to control the settlement of surrounding area. The effect of limiting the deflection and bending moments of sheet pile wall by using sequential excavation was very limited. It is recommended to carry out the sequential excavation when the surrounding area is very sensitive to settlement that control of settlement is of high priorities. But for Spaarndammertunnel, the road near the tunnel is outside the influenced zone even if normal staged excavation is used. The modelling of sequential excavation requires a lot of time and effort, the execution requires even more time and effort. So the disadvantages of applying sequential excavation method in Spaarndammertunnel outweigh the advantages. Geo-engineeringGeoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Globally {{there are}} about 50, 000 large dams and among them 25, 500 are the storage {{reservoirs}} with storage volume of about 6, 464 Bm 3. Worldâ€™s annual reservoir storage loss in different regions due to sedimentation varies between 0. 08 - 2. 3 %, {{with an average of}} about 0. 6 %. It is estimated that in 2030 the demand of water would be 8500 Bm 3, but the existing storage would be around 7000 Bm 3. To meet 1500 Bm 3 shortfall, about 8100 reservoirs are needed and construction of so many reservoirs in future seems to be difficult. The only solution is to conserve the existing reservoirs by enhancing their lives by adopting appropriate measures. Various methods employed globally to conserve storage capacities of reservoirs arewatershed management, conventional dredging, <b>dry</b> <b>excavation,</b> hydrosuction, sediment routing/sluicing, sediment bypassing, density current venting, and sediment flushing through the reservoir, used independently or in combination. Present study focuses on the flushing operation to enhance the lives of reservoirs and toanswer several questions related to flushing operation, like, is reservoir flushable?, if yes, then what would be the flushing efficiency?, how many times in a year it should be flushed?, when it should be flushed?, how much would be the flushing discharge required?, how much should be the duration of flushing?, how much water would be sacrificed for the flushing operation?, and what would be the recovery in capacity of the reservoir considering the flushing operation?, etc. Flushing is a method by which the flow velocities in a Reservoir are increased to such alevel that deposited sediments are mobilized and transported through low level outlets in the dam. Flushing sediments through reservoirs has been practiced successfully and found to be inexpensive in many cases, however, a significant amount of water is required during flushing operation. Hence, there is need to numerically model the flushing scenarios to check the performances of reservoirs in restoring the reservoir capacities. Flushing probably has been implemented on many hundreds reservoirs of the world, but in literature only about 50 reservoirs are documented as flushed, and flushing data is available for only 25 reservoirs. Among them in literature about 6 reservoirs had been reported as successfully flushed i. e. Baira-India, Gebidem-Switzerland, Gmund-Austria, Hengshan-China, Palagnedra-Switzerland, and Santo-Domingo-Venezuela reservoirs. Various flushing indicators used to assess the feasibility of sediment flushing from reservoirs are Sediment Balance Ratio-SBR, Long Term Capacity Ratio-LTCR, Drawdown Ratio-DDR, Sediment Balance Ratio during full drawdown-SBRd, Flushing Width Ratio-FWR and Top Width Ratio-TWR. The usually adopted critical values of these indicators are: SBR > 1, LTCR approaching to unity, DDR > 0. 7, SBRd > 1, FWR > 1 and TWR = 1 - 2. In the present study, the values of these six flushing indicators were computed for the selected 14 flushed reservoirs of various regions of the world and were compared with their critical values. Out of 14 selected reservoirs, 6 were successfully flushed and 08 were partially flushed. From the analysis it was found that for successfully flushed reservoirs critical values of all six flushing indicators were satisfied, but for the partially flushed reservoirs critical values were also satisfied except for the Flushing Indicator LTCR. It shows the significance of LTCR over the other Flushing Indicators. So it was learnt that LTCR is the most important flushing indicator among the six indicators to assess the feasibility of sediment flushing through the reservoirs. Analysis results of the 14 reservoirs also show that among the successfully flushedreservoirs maximum value of LTCR is 1 for Santo-Domingo and Palagnedra Reservoirs, whereas, Hengshan Reservoir has the least value of LTCR, i. e., 0. 77, which is a successfully flushed reservoir, hence it was concluded that the critical value of LTCR may be taken as 0. 77 instead of 1 for the successfully flushed reservoirs. Equations were developed for SBR and LTCR by Multiple Non-linear Regression Analysis, using the data of six successfully flushed reservoirs. These equations were tested on foreign and Pakistani reservoirs and the comparison revealed that developed equations results match well with the results of Atkinson equations. To get confidence in numerically simulating the flushing scenarios, flushing operations were modeled for three successfully flushed reservoirs for which data of entire flushing activities were available to calibrate and validate the Flushing Models. To numerically simulate flushing operations, initially these three reservoirs were modeled for the sediment deposition processes. These reservoirs are Baira of India, Gebidem of Switzerland and Gmund of Austria. Flushing processes have been modeled using three Models, i. e. SHARC, HEC-RAS 4. 1. 0, and Tsinghua University Equation. Results of the study show that SHARC Model well simulates the sediment deposition processes, but it underestimates the flushing durations. Results of the HEC-RAS 4. 1. 0 Model show that it can well simulate sediment depositions and sediment flushing operations. Then Tsinghua University Equation was used for simulating the sediment flushing operations through these three reservoirs. Results of the Tsinghua University Equation reveal that Model well simulates sediment flushing operations through these reservoirs. All small reservoirs of Punjab Small Dams Organization (SDO) of Pakistan were investigated, and 20 reservoirs were selected based on detailed data availability to assess their feasibility for sediment flushing. The results reveal that based on the computed Flushing Indicators, 5 reservoirs can be ranked as likely to be successfully flushed, these are Jammargal, Phalina, Dharabi, Talikna, and Jabbi reservoirs. Among the five likely to be successfully flushed reservoirs, Jabbi reservoir having 3. 8 Mm 3 storage capacity was selected for modeling the sediment deposition and flushing processes. Jabbi Reservoir was created after the construction of Dam across Jabbi Nullah by the end of year 1990. Hydrographic survey of the reservoir was conducted after 10 years of operation in 2000, which was used for the validation of the sediment deposition process in the reservoir. The survey results show that sediment deposition in 10 years was about 0. 418 Mm 3. As results of the flushing modeling on the three foreign reservoirs proved that HEC-RAS 4. 1. 0 and Tsinghua University Equation well simulate the flushing processes, hence flushing operations of Jabbi Reservoir were modeled using two Models i. e. HEC-RAS 4. 1. 0 and Tsinghua University Equation, under two scenarios, i. e. flushing after one year and ten years of sediment deposition. Results of the both the Models and both the options for sediment deposition show good agreement with the observed deposited sediments. A complete flushing operation includes the emptying of reservoir, flushing the sediment through the reservoir and refilling of the reservoir. Considering the results of complete flushing operation it was estimated that refilling time required for the reservoir is about 64 % of the year as inflows to the reservoir are intermittent, hence annual flushing of the reservoir looks infeasible, however, large quantity of water for the flushing operation of the reservoir may be sacrificed after 10 years. HEC-RAS 4. 1. 0 and Tsinghua University Model Results were used to formulate the complete strategy for flushing the reservoir. Model results revealed that for flushing the Jabbi Reservoir after 10 years deposition, appropriate flushing months are July and August; suitable flushing discharge is 3 cumecs; time required to empty the reservoir is 0. 34 day; time required to refill the reservoir is 235 days; flushing duration required to flush 10 years deposited sediments is about 4 days; average flushable sediment diameter is 10 mm; and water required for flushing the reservoir would be about 4. 4 Mm 3. Following the knowledge earned from this research work, similar procedures can be applied to other reservoirs of the world to check the degree of success in flushing operation, moreover, flushing plans / strategies can be formulated and relevant recovery in the reservoir capacities can be assessed...|$|E
