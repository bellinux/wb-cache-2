5|$|Other than {{participating}} in the Battle of Midway in June 1942, where she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> combat, the ship {{spent most of the}} first two years of the Pacific War training in home waters. She was transferred to Truk in mid-1943, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> any combat until the Battle of the Philippine Sea in mid-1944 when she was attacked by American aircraft. Nagato did not fire her main armament against enemy vessels until the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944. She was lightly damaged during the battle and returned to Japan the following month. The IJN was running out of fuel by this time and decided not to fully repair her. Nagato was converted into a floating anti-aircraft platform and assigned to coastal defense duties. She was attacked in July 1945 as part of the American campaign to destroy the IJN's last remaining capital ships, but was only slightly damaged. In mid-1946, the ship was a target for nuclear weapon tests during Operation Crossroads. She survived the first test with little damage, but was sunk by the second.|$|E
