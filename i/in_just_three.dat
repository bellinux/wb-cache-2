Both Horsfield and Warnock wanted {{to terminate the}} loan prematurely, but West Bromwich Albion had already agreed to sell the player to United {{at the end of}} the season and refused to go back on the deal. The permanent transfer went through in May 2006 for a fee of £1.2million, with Horsfield commenting that he and Warnock had resolved their differences.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{the club}} was {{purchased}} by Lebanese businessman Sam Hammam, who invested money into the side and saw them rise from the fourth tier to the second tier <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>three</b> seasons. Although Hammam left the club in 2006, they continued their progress, reaching the Football League Championship play-offs for three consecutive seasons between 2009 and 2012, suffering defeat on all three occasions. The following season, under the ownership of new owner Vincent Tan, they finished first in the Championship, winning promotion back into the top tier {{for the first time}} since 1962. However, they suffered relegation in their only season and returned to the Championship where they currently remain.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1921 season, Barrow was {{appointed}} {{general manager of}} the New York Yankees and requested that Krichell join him as a full-time scout. At the time, the Yankees had a two-man scouting rotation, and Barrow believed the appointment of Krichell would improve the scouting staff. The first player signed by Krichell was Hinkey Haines, an outfielder from Penn State University. He signed catcher Benny Bengough from Buffalo of the International League, and Charlie Caldwell, a Princeton University graduate. Caldwell was used mainly as a batting practice pitcher, appearing <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>three</b> games in his major league career. During one practice, Caldwell fractured Wally Pipp's skull with a high fastball, allowing Lou Gehrig to assume Pipp's place in the starting lineup.|$|E

5|$|During {{his playing}} career, Hamilton played for six {{different}} {{teams in the}} Football League, making a total of over 300 first-team appearances, mostly with Blackburn Rovers and Wigan Athletic. He started his career with Sunderland, and was there for three seasons before moving to Blackburn in 1981. He went on to score seven goals in 114 Football League appearances in five seasons for Blackburn, {{and he had a}} loan spell at Cardiff City in 1985. He was signed by Wigan Athletic in 1986 and he played in over 100 league matches for them <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>three</b> seasons. After leaving Wigan in 1989, he spent one season with Chester City, where he made 30 league appearances before joining Fourth Division side Burnley in 1990. He played 15 matches in two years for Burnley before retiring {{at the end of the}} 1991–92 season.|$|E
5|$|In June 1912, the Greek Navy {{selected}} tenders from Germany's AG Vulcan for two destroyers and six torpedo boats, to {{be completed}} <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>three</b> to four months. This exceptionally short timeframe was accomplished through {{the help of the}} German Navy, which allowed the Greeks to take over German ships then being constructed. The contract price was evidently low, as one British firm complained that they could not understand how Vulcan would make a profit. Then, one month later, the Greeks selected Vulcan again for the construction of their battlecruiser, with its armor and armament coming from Bethlehem Steel in the United States. British firms were furious, again alleging that it would be impossible for Vulcan to make a profit on the contract, and surmising that the German government was subsidizing the purchase to get a foothold in the shipbuilding market. The Greeks, for their part, countered that the British manufacturers were colluding to keep armor plate prices high, and so they were able to significantly decrease their costs by ordering the ship's armor in the United States.|$|E

5|$|The First World War {{broke out}} in 1914, when {{military}} opinions on the utility of Calshot Castle had shifted considerably. The decision was taken to rely primarily on gun batteries at the two entrances to the Solent, rather than at Calshot and Southampton Water. At the start of conflict the boom was removed and replaced by anti-submarine nets further up the coast' two of Calshot's guns were removed the following year to protect the new nets. The airbase was used for training purposes until 1916, when it took on anti-submarine patrols over the Channel, where the German raids had started to inflict critical damage. Almost 3,500 hours were flown by aircraft from Calshot that year, with over 3,500 being flown in 1917 and over 9,000 <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>three</b> months of 1918. Subordinate air stations were created in Bembridge, Newhaven, Polegate and Portland. A cabin was built {{on top of the}} keep to oversee air operations, the Castle Yacht Club was taken over for use as the officers' mess and the air station spread out across Calshot Spit, including occupying the 1895 battery. Calshot's remaining guns were removed and probably dispatched to the front line in France.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall {{showed his}} {{versatility}} {{again in the}} First Test in Brisbane, scoring an unbeaten 38 in the second innings to extend Australia's lead to 373. When South Africa attempted to chase the target, Lindwall took 5/60 to cut them down 96 runs short of victory. Lindwall was reunited with Miller when the latter returned from injury for the Second Test at Melbourne, and despite the old combination taking 12 wickets, with Lindwall taking match figures of 5/116, Australia fell 82 runs short and South Africa had its first Test win against Australia in 42 years. The teams moved to the home ground of Miller and Lindwall for the Third Test in Sydney, and the local pair delivered, taking seven wickets between them to skittle the tourists for 173, with Lindwall taking 4/40. With Australia having taken a 270 first innings lead, Lindwall allowed Australia to seize the initiative, removing both openers in his first three overs, before ending with 4/72 to ensure an innings victory and a 2–1 series lead. The value of Lindwall and Miller were demonstrated during the final two Tests. At the Fourth Test in Adelaide, both broke down mid-game and left Australia two bowlers short. Chasing 377, the South Africans managed {{to stave off the}} bowling and secure a draw. Both were absent for the Fifth Test in Melbourne and South Africa capitalised, defeating the Australians by six wickets despite the home side having scored 520 in their first innings. The absence of Lindwall and Miller's new ball partnership allowed South Africa to fight back and draw the series 2–2, making it the first series that Australia had not won since 1938. Lindwall had taken 19 wickets at 20.16 <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>three</b> and a half Tests for the series, and Australia seemed unlikely to find replacements for their leading strike pair anytime soon; their eventual successors Richie Benaud and Alan Davidson were still to become regular internationals.|$|E
5|$|On July 27, 2016, Nowitzki re-signed {{with the}} Mavericks. Nowitzki {{appeared}} <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>three</b> of the Mavericks' first 13 {{games of the}} season due to illness and a strained left Achilles tendon. He returned for the 14th game of the season, but with a loss to the Los Angeles Clippers, the Mavericks fell to a 2–12 record – their worst start since going 1–23 in 1993–94. He appeared in one more before sitting out 14 straight with further Achilles tendon issues, this time on his right foot. In his return game on December 23, Nowitzki scored 17 first-half points (playing only 15 minutes before sitting out the second half) in a 90–88 win over the Clippers. On February 7, 2017 against Portland, Nowitzki moved into 10th place all-time in field goals with 10,517. Also, his two blocked shots against the Trail Blazers gave him 1,200 for this career, the 55th player in NBA history to reach that figure. On March 7, 2017, in a 122–111 win over the Los Angeles Lakers, Nowitzki became the sixth player in NBA history to score 30,000 regular-season points. He also became the first international player to reach the milestone and one of only three to score all 30,000-plus with one team—the others being Karl Malone (Utah) and Kobe Bryant (Lakers).|$|E

5|$|While some records such as Christophe Plantin's exist of what exact types {{were cut}} by Garamond himself, many {{details of his}} career remain uncertain: early {{estimates}} placed Garamond’s date of birth 1480, but modern opinion proposes much later estimates. A document called the Le Bé Memorandum (based on the memories of Guillaume Le Bé, but collated {{by one of his}} sons around 1643) suggests that Garamond finished his apprenticeship around 1510. This is considered unlikely by modern historians since his mother was still alive when he died in 1561 and little is known of him before around 1540. It has been suggested that the first Roman types designed by Claude Garamond were a set created for Robert Estienne and first used by him around 1530-3, that were the first typefaces used in Paris to copy the Manutius model. However, Vervliet suggests that these 'Estienne typefaces' were not designed by Garamond and that his career began somewhat later. Vervliet suggests that the creator of this set of typefaces to a unified design may have been a 'Master Constantin', recorded in the Le Bé Memorandum as a master type designer of the period before Garamond but about whom nothing is otherwise known and to whom no obvious other body of work can be ascribed. If so, his disappearance from history (perhaps due to an early death, since all his presumed work appeared <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>three</b> years from 1530 to 1533) and the execution of Augereau on a charge of heresy in 1534 may have allowed Garamond's reputation to develop in the following decade.|$|E
