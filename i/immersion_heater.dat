25|$|Electrical {{immersion}} heaters may heat water immediately {{adjacent to the}} heating element high enough to promote the formation of scale, commonly calcium carbonate, in hard water areas. This accumulates on the element, and over time, as the element expands and contracts through its heating cycle, the scale cracks off and drops {{to the bottom of}} the tank, progressively filling up the tank. This reduces the tank's capacity and, where the <b>immersion</b> <b>heater</b> is secondary to the heating of the water by a coil fed from a gas or oil-fired boiler, can reduce the efficiency of the primary heating source by covering that other coil and in turn reducing its efficiency. Regular flushing-out of accumulated sediment can reduce this problem.|$|E
25|$|Domestic {{immersion}} heaters, usually {{rated at}} 3 kilowatts {{and on a}} 1.5-inch British Standard Pipe screwplug in the UK, run on the normal domestic electricity supply, but users may also {{take advantage of a}} cheaper, off-peak electricity tariff such as Economy 7 (in the UK). In a typical off-peak installation, a lower <b>immersion</b> <b>heater</b> is connected to the separately switched off-peak heating circuit and an upper heater is connected to the normal circuit via its own switch. The consumer then has the option to top up the available hot water supply at any time, rather than waiting for the cheaper supply to turn on (typically after midnight). A poorly insulated hot water cylinder will increase running costs because a consumer must pay for electricity used to replace lost heat.|$|E

50|$|Most commonly, {{aquarium}} <b>heaters</b> are <b>immersion</b> style <b>heaters,</b> these heaters {{consist of}} a glass tube containing a heating element wound around a ceramic or glass insert. Some glass <b>immersion</b> <b>heaters</b> also contain sand, and most, but not all, are fully submersible. The glass tube also contains an adjustable thermostat which turns the heating element on to maintain the required temperature. This thermostat is often a bimetallic strip; because the strip contains two metals, the metals will expand at different rates when the temperature rises, causing the strip to bend. This strip carries the current, but breaks the current at the correct temperature. The setting of this bimetallic strip can be adjusted. More advanced thermostats may use microchip technology. A small light in the heater is often included to indicate operation.|$|R

50|$|Where hot-water {{space heating}} boilers are installed, {{domestic}} hot water cylinders are usually heated indirectly by primary water from the boiler, or by an electric <b>immersion</b> <b>heater</b> (often as backup to the boiler). In the UK these vessels are called indirect cylinders, or direct cylinders, respectively.

40|$|In hotels, hospitals, nursing homes, sport centres, {{block of}} flats and apartments {{buildings}} the annual energy demand for heating of domestic hot water (DHW) typically range from 25 to 60 % of the total annual heating demand of the building.

Possible heating systems include electric <b>immersion</b> <b>heaters,</b> solar collectors in combination with electric <b>immersion</b> <b>heaters</b> for supplementary heating, gas-fired boilers, pellet-fired boilers and heat pump water heaters (HPWH) utilizing e. g. ambient air, exhaust ventilation air, groundwater, boreholes in crystalline rock or grey water as heat source. This papers shows that HPWH systems using carbon dioxide (CO 2, R 744) as working fluid will typically achieve 20 % higher COP than the most energy-efficient HPWH systems on the market using HFC or propane as working fluid. In terms of energy efficiency and utilization of renewable heat it even outperforms state-of-the-art solar heating systems. Air-to-water and water-to-water CO 2 HPWHs in the capacity range from about 5 to 60 kW have now become commercially available in Japan and Europe from a number of Japanese manufacturers...|$|R

40|$|The project {{entitled}} 'Scaleable Clean Aluminum Melting Systems' was a Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) between Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Secat Inc. The three-year {{project was}} initially funded {{for the first}} year and was then canceled due to funding cuts at the DOE headquarters. The limited funds allowed the research team to visit industrial sites and investigate the status of using <b>immersion</b> <b>heaters</b> for aluminum melting applications. Primary concepts were proposed on the design of furnaces using <b>immersion</b> <b>heaters</b> for melting. The proposed project can continue if the funding agency resumes the funds to this research. The objective of this project was to develop and demonstrate integrated, retrofitable technologies for clean melting systems for aluminum in both the Metal Casting and integrated aluminum processing industries. The scope focused on immersion heating coupled with metal circulation systems that provide significant opportunity for energy savings as well as reduction of melt loss in the form of dross. The project aimed at the development and integration of technologies that would enable significant reduction in the energy consumption and environmental impacts of melting aluminum through substitution of immersion heating for the conventional radiant burner methods used in reverberatory furnaces. Specifically, the program would couple heater improvements with furnace modeling that would enable cost-effective retrofits to a range of existing furnace sizes, reducing the economic barrier to application...|$|R
5000|$|Air {{leaving the}} {{building}} {{when the heat}} pump's compressor is running is usually at around -1° in most versions, thus the unit is extracting heat from the air {{that needs to be}} changed (at around a half an air change per hour) [...] Air entering the house is of course generally warmer than the air processed through the unit so there is a net 'gain'. Care must be taken that these are only used in the correct type of houses. Many specifiers mis-understand that low heat loss means small. Exhaust air heat pumps have minimum flow rates that when installed in a small flat the air flow chronically over ventilates the flat increasing the heat los by drawing in large amounts of unwanted outside air. For most exhaust air heat pumps there will be a low heat output to the hot water and heating of just around 1.2 Kw from the compressor / heat pump process but if that falls short of the building's requirements additional heat will be automatically triggered in the form of immersion heaters or an external gas boiler. The <b>immersion</b> <b>heater</b> top up will be substantial and when a unit with a 6 kW <b>immersion</b> <b>heater</b> operates at full output it will cost £1 per hour to run.|$|E
