5|$|Mulder, still {{restrained}} {{in his bed}} at the hospital, {{sees the}} silhouette of the monster at the window. <b>He</b> <b>screams</b> for the nurse, but she has already been bitten and opens the window to let the monster in. Scully tries to visit Mulder but the nurse refuses access. Suddenly Scully sees the nurse as a corpse, realizes that Mulder is in danger, and runs into Mulder's room. There she sees the monster {{on the wall and}} shoots at it. It leaps through the partially open window, breaking the glass and wooden frame.|$|E
5|$|The {{first episode}} starts with Kills furiously {{walking with a}} {{revolver}} in direction of a blonde man; she later ties him up on a bed, as <b>he</b> <b>screams</b> and tries to resist. Kills calls a friend whose name is not revealed, and asks him for help. During the second episode, Kills assassinates another man and takes his photograph; the next episode, she is arrested by a group—played by Far East Movement—who threaten her. She manages to strangle {{the leader of the}} group, and later leaves a message for her anonymous friend, warning him that her face is being distributed on wanted posters.|$|E
5|$|In Worcester, Massachusetts, Carlton Chase {{runs from}} an unknown assailant, makes a brief phone call, and then runs {{to a police}} station. After a {{skirmish}} with the guards, he is placed in a large room with cinder blocks for walls and a solid steel door. <b>He</b> <b>screams</b> at the officer that he still is not safe. Suddenly, and mysteriously, he is shot from inside the room. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) are informed that Chase was killed with an armor-piercing round, which appears to have entered the room through the air vent in the ceiling. Upon further investigation, the agents discover that the assassin shot through the roof, ceiling and ductwork, and into the victim.|$|E
60|$|I bent down, scooped the Little Nugget out of {{his chair}} like an oyster, and made for the door. Outside <b>he</b> <b>screamed</b> incessantly. <b>He</b> kicked me in the stomach and then on the knee. <b>He</b> {{continued}} to <b>scream.</b> <b>He</b> <b>screamed</b> all the way upstairs. <b>He</b> was <b>screaming</b> when we reached his room.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>screamed</b> as I flung him; {{my mother}} screamed; and Giojoso screamed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Damnation!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>screamed,</b> {{in sudden}} passion, {{stamping}} on the floor, and pulling furiously at the hair, {{as if it}} burned him. [...] "Where did this come from? Take it off!--burn it up!--burn it up!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>screamed,</b> tearing it off, and throwing it into the charcoal. [...] "What did you bring it to me for?" ...|$|R
25|$|Corso pursues Balkan to {{a remote}} castle, {{depicted}} {{in one of the}} engravings, and finds Balkan preparing the final ritual. After a struggle, Balkan traps Corso in a hole in the floor. Balkan performs his summoning ritual: he arranges the engravings on a makeshift altar, and recites a series of phrases related to each of the nine engravings. Balkan then douses the floor and himself with gasoline and sets it alight, believing himself to be immune to suffering. Balkan's invocation fails, and <b>he</b> <b>screams</b> in pain as the flames engulf him. Corso frees himself, shoots Balkan, takes the engravings, and escapes.|$|E
25|$|Weeks later, on {{his first}} day back at the office, excited to see his story in print, Pabst arrives empty-handed and informs them the whole month's run of the {{magazine}} has been pulped, as the owner wouldn't publish a story featuring a black hero. Pabst tells Benny he is being forced to fire him as well. Benny breaks down; <b>he</b> <b>screams</b> that although the world can deny him, they cannot destroy his ideas and the future he envisions is real. He collapses to the floor sobbing and is taken away by an ambulance. As he falls unconscious, he looks through the window and, rather than the city, sees stars streaking past. The preacher sits by him and tells him that he is both the dreamer and the dream. Sisko wakes up back on the station. He is deeply moved by his vision, and wonders if somewhere Benny Russell is dreaming of Deep Space Nine.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{ends with}} Pete scolding Tracy and Jenna for their bad behavior, {{and the two}} apologize, promise to be good, and are about to sing Pete a thank you song, only for Pete to awaken (this having been a dream) at his desk. [...] Kenneth arrives, and it soon turns out that Pete is having an erotic dream about Kenneth and Liz. [...] Pete is unable to wake up, and <b>he</b> <b>screams</b> in horror.|$|E
60|$|He could {{scarcely}} believe she meant it, {{but when he}} did believe <b>he</b> <b>screamed</b> with joy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here! Here!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>screamed</b> out twice. There was {{no mistaking}} his astonishment, his shocked incredulity--something like frightened disgust.|$|R
6000|$|And the maddened sea-gull seemed Still to utter, as <b>he</b> <b>screamed,</b> [...] "Perish {{thus the}} wretch who deemed [...] Himself Cooke!" ...|$|R
500|$|The Scary Door, a show-within-a-show on Futurama parodying The Twilight Zone, pokes fun at {{the final}} twist in [...] "Time Enough at Last". When {{the man in the}} episode loses his glasses, he realizes he can still read large print; his eyes fall out, but he {{declares}} he can read Braille; his hands fall off, and as <b>he</b> <b>screams,</b> his tongue falls out and then his head falls off. Bender comments, [...] "Cursed by his own hubris." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} media critics. Paul Mavis of the DVD Talk said the episode is [...] "a real treat for fans of westerns and spaghetti westerns" [...] because [...] "the writers play off time-honored genre clichés so well." [...] Mavis lauded Plankton's {{appearance in the}} episode, saying [...] "Plankton reaches insane levels of hilarity here, brandishing a whip like Lash LaRue and cracking it at the 'hayseeds' that get in his way." [...] He also praised Plankton's voice actor, Mr. Lawrence, on his role, writing [...] "It's a terrific vocal performance by [...] Doug Lawrence (made even more funny during the town's ritualized squashing of villain Dead-Eye, as <b>he</b> <b>screams</b> grotesquely off-camera)." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{the monsters}} battle {{each other at}} the end of the episode, a Japanese man sings songs about each of the monsters while they approach. This mirrors a common element {{throughout}} actual Japanese monster movies, which commonly have theme songs for the monster characters. Parker wrote the songs in Japanese language. The English translation for the lyrics sung when Robert Smith transforms translates are, [...] "I really like Robert Smith", and the lyrics sung about Mecha-Streisand translate, [...] "Barbra, Barbra, she's a bitch, Barbra". When Streisand becomes Mecha-Streisand, the line was written in Japanese, [...] "From this moment on, I am Mecha-Streisand!", but Parker said Bergman misread some of the words so the on-air translation was imperfect. Before Leonard Maltin transforms, <b>he</b> <b>screams</b> in Japanese, [...] "Listen, listen, here's a tulip", which Parker said is a phrase Japanese children say before passing gas.|$|E
6000|$|... "Master me!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>screamed.</b> <b>He</b> rose in his indignation {{and faced}} her. But his glance, unable {{to support her}} steady eyes, faltered and fell away. Foul oaths poured from his royal lips. [...] "Master me!" [...] he repeated.|$|R
5000|$|Legend has it that, as Fu Jiān escaped, <b>he</b> <b>screamed</b> to the sky, [...] "天亡我也！", {{which means}} [...] "The heaven has annihilated me!" [...]|$|R
5000|$|Tyler McVey (General Hardesty, another conspirator: [...] "Barney Rutkowski, Air Defense. <b>He's</b> <b>screaming</b> bloody murder {{about those}} twelve troop {{carriers}} dispatched to El Paso.") ...|$|R
500|$|When {{asked why}} he was {{compelled}} to revisit the Velázquez so often, Bacon replied that he had nothing against popes per se, but merely sought [...] "an excuse to use these colours, and you can't give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting {{into a sort of}} false fauve manner." [...] Schmied sees HeadVI as a reaction against Velázquez, and a commentary on how the papacy is [...] "obsolete and decayed", with a pope resistant to both modernisation and secularisation. To him, the figure seems to [...] "resist the maltreatment of image and tries to halt the impending collapse of the established work order. <b>He</b> <b>screams</b> and grimaces, clutching at arms of his throne." [...] Sylvester notes that Bacon was impressed by Picasso's figuration and handling of paint, especially in Picasso's 1930s works; and suggests that the white blobs around the pope's cape may be influenced by the 1913 Woman in a Slip Seated in an Armchair.|$|E
500|$|The Jesus Vs. Satan {{pay-per-view}} event [...] "Boutin' at the Mountain" [...] is {{a parody}} of similarly advertised pay-to-watch boxing events featured on the premium cable channel HBO. Before Jimbo shoots Kenny in his platypus state, <b>he</b> <b>screams,</b> [...] "It's coming right for us!" [...] This is {{a reference to the}} previous South Park episode [...] "Volcano", in which Jimbo takes the children hunting and tells them to shout the phrase before shooting anything to get around restrictive hunting laws. Cartman insults Damien by asking if he got his haircut from Stevie Wonder, a blind soul and R singer. For his birthday, Cartman wants the complete line of a set of action figures called Mega Man. Although named Mega Man, the multi-colored figures were actually inspired by the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the 1993 children's action series which was still popular {{at the time of the}} episode's original broadcast. The script was originally written with direct references to the Power Rangers, but Comedy Central asked Parker and Stone to change the name due to copyright issues. Cartman receives Ants in the Pants, an actual children's tabletop game, as a birthday present. Stone described Ants in the Pants as [...] "the lamest game ever", which is why Cartman responds so negatively to the gift in the episode.|$|E
500|$|Sundaram is {{admitted}} to hospital but recovers from the incident. Later, he and Mohana {{meet in a}} concert programme where they perform, against Mohana's mother's wishes. For his personal gains, [...] "Savadal" [...] Vaithi (Nagesh), a cunning man, befriends the Maharaja of Madhanpur (M. N. Nambiar), who is the programme's chief guest. Vaithi promises to make Mohana the Maharaja's mistress. Vaithi traps Mohana by telling her that the Maharaja has invited Nadhaswaram and Bharatanatyam performers to perform in his palace, and that Sundaram has also decided to attend. Mohana immediately accepts the offer and the two visit Madhanpur. Vaithi treats Sundaram's group badly and Sundaram decides to leave. He sees Mohana visiting the Maharaja's room. The Maharaja asks Mohana to be his mistress. but she rejects his advances and is rescued by the Maharaja's wife, the Maharani. Sundaram decides that Mohana does not love him, despite her repeated denial of the Maharaja's offer. Depressed, Mohana runs away. The Maharaja reveals the truth to Sundaram that Mohana had refused his offer and she only loves Sundaram. Sundaram realises his mistake, and rushes to apologise to Mohana, but sees her trying to hang herself from the ceiling of a room {{in which she had}} locked herself. <b>He</b> <b>screams</b> to her to stop and promises he will never doubt her love again. Sundaram breaks the door and saves Mohana. They then get married with the approval of her mother. Vaithi is arrested for his crimes.|$|E

2500|$|In 2014, the Chick tract Unforgiven was {{distributed}} by Bible Baptist Church in Garden City, Roanoke, Virginia and drew outrage from the area's Muslim community. The tract {{tells the story}} of an African-American man who, while in prison, is coerced into joining the Islamic faith and changes his name to Muhammad. [...] Upon his release he threatens his Christian grandmother. Hussain Al-Shiblawi, a local man, told WDBJ-TV that he gets pamphlets from the church every Sunday and that they are typically inspirational, but that this one was different. “It basically indicated that the people are violent, the religion itself is violent, and the facts in here are not true,” he said. “It shows him trying to kill his mother saying, ‘If you weren’t my grandma, I’d kill you where you stand, Allahu Akbar.’” In one scene, the grandmother begs Lamont to return to the Christian faith, telling him he’ll “die in [...] sins” and be unforgiven by God if he doesn’t. But the young man isn’t swayed by her pleas. “I choose Muhammad! And I hate your Jesus, your Bible and you!,” <b>he</b> <b>screams.</b> “Get out of my house you infidel!” Bible Baptist Church said the church did not write the tract and simply distributed it.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the finale}} of The Producer's Cut, Kara {{is to be}} used as a human {{sacrifice}} for Myers, and awakens at Smith's Grove Sanitarium on a concrete slab, surrounded by the cult's followers. She is ultimately saved by Tommy, who uses runes to stop Michael from pursuing them, and they escape with Jamie's newborn baby; it is implied by Kara in the film that the baby is a product of incest between Jamie and Michael. The original ending of the sixth film was different, following a different aspect of the plot involving Dr. Wynn and the whole cult keeping true to cult duties, planning Michael to sacrifice the baby to be relinquished from the curse that will be passed onto Danny after he sacrifices his mother. Later, after telling the others he has got “a little business to attend to”, Loomis walks back into the sanitarium to find a seemingly-defeated Michael lying on the floor of the main hallway after having his power drained from him by a circle of runes set by Tommy Doyle. Upon removing the mask telling him it was all over, the person is revealed to be Dr. Wynn, who was forced by Michael to switch outfits so that he could escape. With his dying breath, he grabs Loomis's hand and says, [...] "It's your game now, Dr. Loomis." [...] After Wynn dies, Loomis looks at the wrist of the hand Wynn had just grabbed, and the Thorn symbol appears on his wrist. Realizing now that Loomis himself is now to act as the leader of the cult, <b>he</b> <b>screams.</b> This scream is used in the final ending.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{many artists}} who {{appeared}} on the show, Nirvana filmed its entire performance in a single take. The band's fourteen-song setlist included a single song from its debut album, Bleach, four songs from the 1991 album Nevermind, three tracks from the then-recently released In Utero, and six cover songs. The group shied away from playing its better-known songs; the only contemporary hit the band performed was its 1992 single [...] "Come as You Are". Ten songs in, Cris and Curt Kirkwood of the Meat Puppets joined the band onstage to perform three of their group's songs with Nirvana. The set ended with a performance of the traditional song [...] "Where Did You Sleep Last Night", following the arrangement of blues musician Lead Belly, whom Cobain described right before the song as [...] "his favorite performer ever". This rendition has been {{regarded as one of}} the greatest live single song performances of all time. As The Atlantic critic Andrew Wallace Chamings described, [...] "For the final line, 'I would shiver the whole night through,' Cobain jumps up an octave, forcing him to strain so far <b>he</b> <b>screams</b> and cracks. He hits the word 'shiver' so hard that the band stops, as if a fight broke out at a sitcom wedding. Next he howls the word 'whole' and then does something very strange in the brief silence that follows, something that's hard to describe: He opens his piercingly blue eyes so suddenly it feels like someone or something else is looking out under the bleached lank fringe, with a strange clarity. Then he finishes the song." [...] After the band finished, Cobain argued with the show's producers, who wanted an encore. Cobain refused because he felt he could not top the performance of that song.|$|E
