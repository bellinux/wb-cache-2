The plan's supporters argue that the tax would broaden the tax base, that it would be progressive, and that it would decrease tax burdens and start taxing wealth (reducing the economic gap). Opponents argue that a national sales tax would be inherently regressive and would decrease tax burdens paid by high-income individuals.

Our simulations suggest that both Property Tax and Waste Management Tax show a moderate regressive impact with respect to household gross income, whilst the Personal Income Tax on dwellings other than the main residence is progressive. We then provide an application of our model, to study the Property Tax reform in 2008. Our findings show that all households owning the main residence gain from the 2008 reform, but tax cuts are mostly concentrated on the top three deciles of household equivalent gross income, so that the richest benefit most.

Using a recent village survey conducted over a significant period of time, this article compares two different governance modes.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{importance}} of entrepreneurship when quantifying the aggregate and distributional effects of switching from a progressive to a proportional income tax system. I find that the distributional consequences of the tax reform in a model economy with entrepreneurs contrast markedly from those in a model economy with no entrepreneurs. The elimination <b>of</b> progressive <b>taxation</b> has a negligible effect on wealth inequality when entrepreneurship is considered but has a large effect when entrepreneurship is omitted. The framework used is an occupational choice model, in which the decision to become an entrepreneur {{is determined by the}} ability to manage a firm and by asset holdings. The calibrated economy can account for the high savings rate of entrepreneurs relative to non-entrepreneurs, and the high concentration of wealth observed in the data.

At Easter {{representatives of}} the Roman Catholic Church and of the German Protestant Church argued for more redistribution. The main tool for redistribution in the German tax system is the progressive income tax. The most important source of funding for the church, the church tax, is directly linked to income. However, for top earners an alternative tax scale applies. In most federal states the church tax {{is limited to a}} certain percentage of taxable income, a provision known as 'capping': hence, in contrast to the throughout progressive income tax, the church tax is lowered to a proportional burden for top earners. Therefore, the churches' demands for more redistribution are inconsistent with the 'capping'.

This does not include old age pensions, which in 1926 - 27 amounted to # 2. 5 million. They were excluded from national income because they are not pensions based on economic service and represent no more than an internal transfer of income on social grounds; but they are part of the spendable fund and must therefore be treated in the national expenditure which, with savings, should amount to # 167. 5 million...|$|E
40|$|Between {{the conquest}} of Padua in 14 O 5 and its {{temporary}} rebellion in 1509, Venice built the strongest territorial state in Italy, expanding its apparatus of government to incorporate originally heterogeneous lands into an administrative whole. Military defeat in 1509 allowed Padua's secession, an anachronistic return to separate identity motivated by its political class's resentment at subjection to Venice: denied representation in mainstream public life, they enjoyed illusory local administrative autonomy. In military terms Padua's passage under Venetian rule was marked by the adaptation of the terraferma provinces' systems of defence to their new territorial configuration, achieved firatly by {{the creation of a}} permanent, professional army. Its units had no particular territorial affiliation; their recruitment, conditions of service and dislocation were decided by central authority. The province of Padua, strategically placed in the terraferma, served to accomodate companies in transit and long-term billetting, and to supply conscript auxiliary forces. Local fortifications were of secondary importance, and in consequence poorly maintained. The army was the main recipient of terraferma taxation, which was dogged by organizational difficulties, in the assignment of income to spending, and in co-ordination between capital and provinces, with a frequent excess of expenditure over effective revenue. Gross imbalance in the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation,</b> with delay and abuse in its collection, characterized Padua's fiscal system. Growing intervention by central government, and the diminution of Paduans' residual fiscal competence, were the constant elements in Venice's largely unsuccessful remedial action. Tax therefore became a point of conflict; Venice grew impatient with Paduan inefficiency and illwill, the Paduan political class showed anger at encroachment by Venetian authority, and fear for the loss of the city's fiscal privilege. </p...|$|E

40|$|Prior to {{the last}} three decades, regular surveys on {{household}} income were rare or nonexistent in many developed countries, {{making it difficult for}} economists to compare income distribution in the long run.

The macroeconomic frameworks of many poor countries are improving, but fiscal policy's full potential will not be realized until good and accountable expenditure and taxation systems are built. Good fiscal policy can raise economic growth through well-chosen public investments provided that the spending is large enough. Growth itself increases the tax base generating the potential for higher public spending on poverty reduction.
