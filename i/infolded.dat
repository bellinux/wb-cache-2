Sessile glands {{similar to those found}} on the stem are also present on the exterior of the upper pitchers, where they occur at a density of 3–4 per mm². In these aerial traps the wings are reduced to a pair of ridges on the ventral surface of the pitcher cup. The pitcher mouth is [...] and has an oblique insertion. It measures around 6cm by 4cm. The peristome is cylindrical in cross section and slightly lobed, with tightly <b>infolded</b> inner and outer margins. It is rather narrow, measuring only 2.5–4mm in diameter. The peristome bears low ribs only 0.1mm high. These are tightly packed, occurring at a density of two per millimetre. The inner margin of the peristome lacks conspicuous teeth. The peristome is elongated into a short neck and here the apertures of the marginal nectar glands are clearly visible.|$|E

6000|$|A narrow rim of {{the broad}} flat {{exterior}} part of each lobe is turned inwards, so that, when the lobes are closed, the exterior surfaces of the <b>infolded</b> portions come into contact. The edge itself bears a row of conical, flattened, transparent points with broad bases, like the prickles on the stem of a bramble or Rubus. As the rim is <b>infolded,</b> these points are directed towards the midrib, and they appear at first {{as if they were}} adapted to prevent the escape of prey; but this can hardly be their chief function, for they are composed of very delicate and highly flexible membrane, which can be easily bent or quite doubled back without being cracked. Nevertheless, the <b>infolded</b> rims, together with the points, must somewhat interfere with the retrograde movement of any small creature, as soon as the lobes begin to close. The circumferential part of the leaf of Aldrovanda thus differs greatly from that of Dionaea; nor can the points on the rim be considered as homologous with the spikes round the leaves of Dionaea, as these latter are prolongations of the blade, and not mere epidermic productions. They appear also to serve for a widely different purpose. [page 325] ...|$|E

The whole of the skinned kid was there, the head curled in against a shoulder, the stubby cut ears, the eyes, the teeth, the few hairs of the nostrils: and the feet curled curiously round, like an animal that puts its fore-paw over its ducked head: and the hind-legs twisted indescribably up: and all {{skewered}} flat-wise upon the long iron rod, so that it was a complete flat pattern. It reminded me intensely of those distorted, slim-limbed, dog-like animals which figure on the old Lombard ornaments, distorted and curiously <b>infolded</b> upon themselves.

60|$|Some of {{the closed}} leaves {{contained}} no prey, {{but in one}} there was a rather large beetle, which from its flattened tibiae I suppose was an aquatic species, but was not allied to Colymbetes. All the softer tissues of this beetle were completely dissolved, and its chitinous integuments were as clean {{as if they had}} been [page 329] boiled in caustic potash; so that it must have been enclosed for a considerable time. The glands were browner and more opaque than those on other leaves which had caught nothing; and the quadrifid processes, from being partly filled with brown granular matter, could be plainly distinguished, which was not the case, as already stated, on the other leaves. Some of the points on the <b>infolded</b> margins likewise contained brownish granular matter. We thus gain additional evidence that the glands, the quadrifid processes, and the marginal points, all have the power of absorbing matter, though probably of a different nature.|$|E

60|$|Aldrovanda vesiculosa, var. verticillata.--Dr. King, Superintendent of the Botanic Gardens, kindly sent me dried {{specimens}} collected near Calcutta. This form was, I believe, {{considered by}} Wallich {{as a distinct}} species, {{under the name of}} verticillata. It resembles the Australian form much more nearly than the European; namely in the projections at {{the upper end of the}} petiole being much attenuated and covered with [page 330] upcurved prickles; they terminate also in two straight little prickles. The bilobed leaves are, I believe, larger and certainly broader even than those of the Australian form; so that the greater convexity of their margins was conspicuous. The length of an open leaf being taken at 100, the breadth of the Bengal form is nearly 173, of the Australian form 147, and of the German 134. The points on the <b>infolded</b> margins are like those in the Australian form. Of the few leaves which were examined, three contained entomostracan crustaceans.|$|E
6000|$|Concluding Remarks.--The {{leaves of}} the three {{foregoing}} closely allied species or varieties are manifestly adapted for catching living creatures. With respect to {{the functions of the}} several parts, {{there can be little doubt}} that the long jointed hairs are sensitive, like those of Dionaea, and that, when touched, they cause the lobes to close. That the glands secrete a true digestive fluid and afterwards absorb the digested matter, is highly probable from the analogy of Dionaea,--from the limpid fluid within their cells being aggregated into spherical masses, after they had absorbed an infusion of raw meat,--from their opaque and granular condition in the leaf, which had enclosed a beetle for a long time,--and from the clean condition of the integuments of this insect, as well as of crustaceans (as described by Cohn), which have been long captured. Again, from the effect produced on the quadrifid processes by an immersion for 24 hrs. in a solution of urea,--from the presence of brown granular matter within the quadrifids of the leaf in which the beetle had been caught,--and from the analogy of Utricularia,--it is probable that these processes absorb excrementitious and decaying animal matter. It is a more curious fact that the points on [page 331] the <b>infolded</b> margins apparently serve to absorb decayed animal matter in the same manner as the quadrifids. We can thus understand the meaning of the <b>infolded</b> margins of the lobes furnished with delicate points directed inwards, and of the broad, flat, outer portions, bearing quadrifid processes; for these surfaces must be liable to be irrigated by foul water flowing from the concavity of the leaf when it contains dead animals. This would follow from various causes,--from the gradual contraction of the concavity,--from fluid in excess being secreted,- -and from the generation of bubbles of air. More observations are requisite on this head; but if this view is correct, we have the remarkable case of different parts of the same leaf serving for very different purposes--one part for true digestion, and another for the absorption of decayed animal matter. We can thus also understand how, by the gradual loss of either power, a plant might be gradually adapted for the one function to the exclusion of the other; and it will hereafter be shown that two genera, namely Pinguicula and Utricularia, belonging to the same family, have been adapted for these two different functions.

60|$|The {{accompanying}} figure (fig. 23) shows a section, {{which happened}} to be strictly medial, through the footstalk and between the nascent antennae of a bladder of Utricularia vulgaris, 1/100 inch in diameter. The specimen was soft, and the young valve became separated from the collar {{to a greater degree}} than is natural, and is thus represented. We here clearly see that the valve and collar are <b>infolded</b> prolongations of the walls of the bladder. Even at this early age, glands could be detected on the valve. The state of the quadrifid processes will presently be described. The antennae at this period consist of minute cellular projections (not shown in the above figure, as they do not lie in the medial plane), which soon bear incipient bristles. In five instances the young antennae were not of quite equal length; and this fact is intelligible if I am right in believing that they represent two divisions of the leaf, rising {{from the end of the}} bladder; for, with the true leaves, whilst very young, the divisions are never, as far as I have seen, strictly opposite; they [page 426] must therefore be developed one after the other, and so it would be with the two antennae.|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThe {{ascending}} aorta and aortic arch {{in patients with}} hypoplasia of the left heart are hypoplastic {{as a result of}} diminished blood flow. In this study, the presence and degree of obstruction owing to areas of narrowing or <b>infolding</b> within the diminutive aorta are quantified, and their surgical significance is discussed. MethodsNinety-six specimens with hypoplasia of the left heart were studied and measurements were taken at specified sites to evaluate areas of narrowing. Quantitative assessments of infoldings and their contribution to obstruction of flow are made. ResultsNarrowing of the distal {{ascending aorta}} was found in 60 (62. 5 %) specimens, with a decrease in circumference of the distal ascending aorta (0. 72 ± 1. 06 mm) present when compared with its midpoint (P <. 05). Tissue <b>infolding</b> at the orifice of the brachiocephalic artery and its junction with the distal ascending aorta was observed in 56 (58. 3 %) hearts, with major <b>infolding</b> in 29 (30. 2 %) and minor <b>infolding</b> in 27 (28. 5 %). Tissue <b>infolding</b> at this site correlated with a smaller ascending aorta (P <. 001) but not with narrowing in the distal ascending aorta (P =. 53). Ductal coarctations were detected in 77 (81. 1 %) specimens. Their presence correlated with a smaller diameter of the ascending aorta (P <. 05), and their severity correlated with the presence of aortic and mitral valvular atresia (P <. 05). ConclusionsImportant areas of obstruction in the ascending aorta in patients with hypoplasia of the left heart were found, and their pathogenesis is discussed. The findings highlight the importance of incorporating the ascending aorta into the aortic reconstruction at the time of initial palliation for patients with hypoplasia of the left heart...|$|R
