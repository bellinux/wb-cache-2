The complex can be compared to proto-urban settlements in the Helmand basin at Mundigak in western Afghanistan and Shahr-e Sukhteh in eastern Iran, or at Harappa and Mohenjo-daro in the Indus Valley.|$|E
25|$|In {{the valleys}} of the empire, <b>irrigation</b> <b>farming</b> was used. Dams {{diverted}} water from natural springs to the fields. This allowed for more regular harvests because {{the prosperity of}} an irrigated field was not dependent upon the rain. Irrigation systems had been in place long before the Aztecs. However, they built canal systems that were longer and more elaborate than any previous irrigation systems. They even managed to divert {{a large portion of}} the Cuauhtitlan River to provide irrigation to large a areas. The network of canals was very complex and intricate.|$|E
25|$|While the {{semi-arid}} plains were {{dominated by}} the nomads, small city-states and sedentary agrarian societies arose in the more humid areas of Central Asia. The Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex of the early 2nd millennium BC was the first sedentary civilisation of the region, practicing <b>irrigation</b> <b>farming</b> of wheat and barley and possibly a form of writing. Bactria-Margiana probably interacted with the contemporary Bronze Age nomads of the Andronovo culture, the originators of the spoke-wheeled chariot, who lived to their north in western Siberia, Russia, and parts of Kazakhstan, and survived as a culture until the 1st millennium BC. These cultures, particularly Bactria-Margiana, have been posited as possible representatives of the hypothetical Aryan culture ancestral to the speakers of the Indo-Iranian languages (see Indo-Iranians).|$|E

The ability of this method to predict how companies will adjust to changes {{in a variety of}} exogenous factors is well known, and when used at the company level it enables aggregation problems to be avoided. In this type of research, the goal is to maximize profit estimated as gross margin. In the present study, we applied the LP model to farms that utilize three different irrigation sources. To design the models, the farms in the study were divided into three groups based on resource of <b>irrigation,</b> <b>farms</b> that use canal water from Drodzan Dam for <b>irrigation,</b> <b>farms</b> that use well water and farms that use a combination of canal and well water for irrigation.|$|R

25|$|Citrus fruits, vegetables, cereal grains, olive oil, and wine—Spain's {{traditional}} agricultural products—continued to {{be important}} in the 1980s. In 1983 they represented 12%, 12%, 8%, 6%, and 4%, respectively, of the country's agricultural production. Because of the changed diet of an increasingly affluent population, there was a notable increase in the consumption of livestock, poultry, and dairy products. Meat production for domestic consumption became the single most important agricultural activity, accounting for 30% of all farm-related production in 1983. Increased attention to livestock was the reason that Spain became a net importer of grains. Ideal growing conditions, combined with proximity to important north European markets, made citrus fruits Spain's leading export. Fresh vegetables and fruits produced through intensive <b>irrigation</b> <b>farming</b> also became important export commodities, as did sunflower seed oil that was produced to compete with the more expensive olive oils in oversupply throughout the Mediterranean countries of the European Community.|$|E

The areas of ecological interest are found in the remaining 3% percent of the terrain. The region is characterized by tilled land and pastures, small pine woods and holm oak woods, with interspersed wasteland areas covered in halophile bushes. There are also many small ephemeral ponds; a characteristic of Spanish steppes, which are only water-filled during the winter. From a conservation standpoint, such ponds, like nearby segments of the Trabancos River's banks, are in a precarious ecological state. Nevertheless, the areas are still capable of sustaining the flora and fauna commensurate with a natural riverside environment.|$|E

2500|$|Economic {{activity}} in the state is closely tied to trends at the national level. This includes the declining contribution to GDP of the agricultural sector {{and an increase in}} manufacturing and commerce/services. The city of Querétaro {{is by far the most}} important economic center in the state, followed by San Juan del Río. Not only is Querétero the population center of the state, it has high-quality soil for <b>irrigation</b> <b>farming</b> and cattle. It is directly connected by highway to Mexico City, the country’s largest market, as well as the north of the country and the United States. This makes the city an almost obligatory stop for most people and goods traveling north and south. This geographical advantage has spurred industrial development in the state, especially since the 1970s. Another advantage the state has is its stable social and political situation. It has a low crime rate and also noted by NGO Transparencia Mexicana as having the lowest levels of corruption among all of Mexico’s states. Of the three main sectors of the economy: agriculture, mining/industry and commerce/services, the percentage each employs and contributes to the GDP varies significantly from municipality to municipality, with agriculture making up a higher percentage of local employment and GDP in rural municipalities than in the Querétaro metropolitan area. However, overall, the state has one of the country’s strongest economies. Government authorities report an increase of 4,602 jobs in the state for January 2011, accounting for a quarter of the gain for the country. [...] Some related to Bombardier.|$|E
