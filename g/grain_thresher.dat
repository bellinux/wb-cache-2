40|$|Numerous {{modeling}} {{approaches of}} the <b>grain</b> <b>threshing</b> and separation process of combine harvesters {{have been published}} in the last 50 years. However, transient process behaviors generally are neglected in these studies. Suitable modeling of these responses is a prerequisite for an efficient monitoring of machine performance to allow for the design of an intelligent harvester. In this work we extend a previously developed state-space modeling framework of the <b>grain</b> <b>threshing</b> and separation process in axial units. The dynamic model is a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The model has the advantage of an intuitive physical model structure which is adaptive and circumventing explicit spatial dependencies by a discretization of the length of the rotor into compartments. The interacting components are quantified in each of the defined compartments and, therefore, also <b>grain</b> <b>threshing</b> and separation losses as well as separation of straw can be quantified. Such models are necessary for model-based identification, like Kalman filtering, or control. In this paper, we utilize it for online state and parameter estimation through Moving Horizon Estimation(MHE). MHE is particularly suited if constraints are present and if uncertain model parameters are estimated simultaneously. The model has been validated in tests with a combine and predicted and experimental data are compared. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] -This work {{presents}} a {{comprehensive mathematical model}} {{of the performance of}} a cereal thresher. The essence of this work is to improve on the performance of <b>grain</b> <b>thresher</b> through a model that will optimize the performance characteristics (velocity, crop feed rate, concave clearance, threshing drum impact force, crop flow rate) of a thresher and minimize its grain damage or losses. To achieve this, equations were derived which describe the threshing rate, threshing loss, grain damage, efficiency and threshing capacity. The equations were used to simulate and optimize the threshing performance of the model. The model was validated with published threshing performance data and it was found generally to fit well, taking R 2 values equal to or greater than 0. 9 which is highly significant (α= 0. 000). The developed model enables optimal parameters to be selected for a design in which the objective function (grain damage or losses) is minimized. At 16 % moisture level, minimal loss is 3. 6792 % and efficiency of 92. 32 % while the performance characteristics are v = 9 m/s, Q = 0. 12 kg/s, c = 0. 015 m...|$|E

By the popular etymology, the name of the village means “a bread place”. After mowing, wheat was delivered to a <b>grain</b> <b>threshing</b> floor and was ground using the wood threshers. Wheat was spread around on the surface of the circle, where rotating threshers were dragged by horses or donkeys. The grain was separated from the loosened chaff and rolled down into the hollow in the center. After being <b>threshed,</b> the <b>grain</b> was brought to a mill for grinding.

50|$|Threshing is a {{key part}} of {{agriculture}} that involves removing the seeds or grain from plants (for example rice or wheat) from the plant stalk. In the case of small farms, threshing is done by beating or crushing the grain by hand or foot, and requires a large amount of hard physical labour. A simple thresher with a crank {{can be used to make}} this work much easier for the farmer. In most cases it takes two people to work these: one person to turn the crank and the other to feed the grain through the machine. These threshers can be built using simple materials and can improve the efficiency of <b>grain</b> <b>threshing.</b> They can also be built with pedals, or be attached to a bicycle, so that the person operating it can simply pedal to reduce the work even more and make threshing faster.|$|R
