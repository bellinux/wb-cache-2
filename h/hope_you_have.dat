Juan Romero, the busboy who shook hands with Kennedy right before he was shot, later said, [...] "It made me realize that no matter how much <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> it can be taken away in a second." ...|$|E
500|$|In a scene {{featuring}} the two title characters having lunch at Katz's Delicatessen in Manhattan, the couple are arguing about a man's {{ability to recognize}} when a woman is faking an orgasm. Sally claims that men cannot tell the difference, and to prove her point, she vividly (fully clothed) fakes one as other diners watch. The scene ends with Sally casually returning to her meal as a nearby patron (played by Reiner's mother) places her order: [...] "I'll have what she's having." [...] When Estelle Reiner died at age 94 in 2008, The New York Times referred to her as the woman [...] "who delivered {{one of the most}} memorably funny lines in movie history". This scene was shot again and again, and Ryan demonstrated her fake orgasms for hours. Katz's Deli still hangs a sign above the table that says, [...] "Where Harry met Sally... <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> what she had!" ...|$|E
500|$|After {{less than}} five years as a judge, Denning was {{appointed}} a Lord Justice of Appeal on 14 October 1948. He was sworn in as a Privy Counsellor on 25 October 1948. As a Lord Justice of Appeal he continued to make reforming judgments in a variety of areas, particularly in family law and the rights of deserted wives. In 1952 the Court of Appeal heard Bendall v McWhirter [...] 2 QB 466 and ruled that a deserted wife occupying the marital home had a personal licence to stay there. The decision provoked disapproval among the judiciary and from the public; a correspondent wrote: Dear Sir: You are a disgrace to all mankind to let these women break up homes and expect us chaps to keep them while they rob us of what we have worked for and put us out on the street. I only <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the same trouble as us. So do us all a favour and take a Rolls and run off Beachy Head and don't come back.|$|E

500|$|B in the Mix: The Remixes {{received}} little promotion compared to Spears' standards. A promotional extended play (EP) titled Key Cuts from Remixed with several remixes from {{the album was}} released in September 2005. A contest was launched on Spears' paid fan site for those who pre-ordered the album. The winner received a copy of , a bottle of Spears' fragrance Fantasy with an additional lotion and make-up kit, and a personalized autographed picture of Spears. On November 22, 2005, the day the album was released, a release party was held at an unspecified nightclub in Los Angeles, California, organized by Spears' management and the webmaster of the fansite WorldOfBritney.com. It was a limited event to five hundred people, including members of the fansite or her official fan club. Spears commented: [...] "I {{just wanted to say}} that I love the idea of all my fans getting together to celebrate the release of my new album. I was happy to help! I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a great night out at the club and dance all night long!".|$|E
2500|$|After the book's publication, Jackson {{wrote to}} Dickinson, [...] "I suppose {{by this time}} you have seen the Masque of Poets. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not regretted giving me that choice bit of verse for it." [...] Jackson also {{published}} {{a review of the}} book, singling out [...] "Success" [...] as [...] "undoubtedly one of the strongest and finest wrought things in the book", before noting conjecture on the poem's authorship would be worthless. Dickinson thanked the publisher Thomas Niles for including her poem, to which he responded somewhat apologetically: [...] "you have doubtless perceived [...] was slightly changed in phraseology." ...|$|E
