The fact that the fire had resulted in significant plutonium contamination of surrounding populated areas remained secret. News reports at the time reported, per the Atomic Energy Commission's briefing, that there was slight risk of light contamination and that no fire fighters had been contaminated. No abnormal radioactivity was reported by the Colorado Public Health Service.|$|E

50|$|<b>Isopleth</b> maps use isolines {{that connect}} points of equal values. A {{good example of}} isolines is {{connecting}} areas with similar temperatures. As with choropleth maps, <b>Isopleth</b> maps require standardized data to be appropriately contoured.|$|E

50|$|Many of the modern, {{advanced}} dispersion modeling {{programs include}} a pre-processor module for {{the input of}} meteorological and other data, and many also include a post-processor module for graphing the output data and/or plotting the area impacted by the air pollutants on maps. The plots of areas impacted may also include <b>isopleths</b> showing areas of minimal to high concentrations that define areas of the highest health risk. The <b>isopleths</b> plots are useful in determining protective actions for the public and responders.|$|R
40|$|Stock-rebuilding time <b>isopleths</b> relate {{constant}} {{levels of}} fishing mortality (F), stock biomass, and management goals to rebuilding times for overfished stocks. We used simulation models with uncertainty about FMSY and variability in annual intrinsic growth rates (ry) to calculate rebuilding time <b>isopleths</b> for Georges Bank yellowtail flounder, Limanda ferruginea, and cowcod rockfish, Sebastes levis, in the Southern California Bight. Stock-rebuilding time distributions from stochastic models were variable and right-skewed, indicating that rebuilding may take less or substantially {{more time than}} expected. The probability of long rebuilding times increased with lower biomass, higher F, uncertainty about FMSY, and autocorrelation in ry values. Uncertainty about FMSY had the greatest effect on rebuilding times. Median recovery times from simulations were insensitive to model assumptions about uncertainty and variability, suggesting that median recovery times {{should be considered in}} rebuilding plans. <b>Isopleths</b> calculated in previous studies by deterministic models approximate median, rather than mean, rebuilding times. Stochastic models allow managers to specify and evaluate the risk (measured as a probability) of not achieving a rebuilding goal according to schedule. Rebuilding time <b>isopleths</b> can be used for stocks with a range of life histories and can be based on any type of population dynamics model. They are directly applicable with constant F rebuilding plans but are also useful in other cases. We used new algorithms for simulating autocorrelated process errors from a gamma distribution and evaluated sensitivity to statistical distributions assumed for ry. Uncertainty about current biomass and fishing mortality rates can be considered with rebuilding time <b>isopleths</b> in evaluating and designing constant-F rebuilding plans...|$|R

50|$|The sample <b>isopleth</b> {{shown in}} red on the {{nomogram}} {{at the top}} of this article calculates the value of T when S = 7.30 and R = 1.17. The <b>isopleth</b> crosses the scale for T at just under 4.65; a larger figure printed in high resolution on paper would yield T = 4.64 to three-digit precision. Note that any variable can be calculated from values of the other two, a feature of nomograms that is particularly useful for equations in which a variable cannot be algebraically isolated from the other variables.|$|E
50|$|While the Arctic Oscillation has an annular {{structure}} centered {{over and}} covering the entire Arctic, the Arctic dipole anomaly has two poles of opposite sign: {{one over the}} Canadian Arctic Archipelago and northern Greenland, the other over the Kara and Laptev Seas. This dipole structure leads to a pressure gradient with a zero <b>isopleth</b> oriented from the Bering Strait, across the Arctic to the Greenland and Barents Seas. As a result, anomalous winds are generally directed parallel to the zero <b>isopleth</b> either towards the Greenland and Barents Seas (positive Arctic dipole anomaly) or toward the Bering Strait (negative Arctic dipole anomaly).|$|E

Phase equilibrium calculation was done using Thermocalc software and experimental DTA results for the chosen alloys in the <b>isopleths</b> with molar ration of In:Sb = 7 : 3; 9 : 1 and 1 : 1. The structural characteristics of these alloys have been investigated using light optic microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, while hardness measurements have also been done. Solidification path for three ternary alloys located on three different investigated <b>isopleths</b> was calculated using Pandat software...|$|R
50|$|T-LoCoH (time local convex hull) is an {{enhanced}} version of LoCoH which incorporates time {{into the home}} range construction. Time is incorporated into the algorithm via an alternative measure of 'distance', called time scaled distance (TSD), which combines the spatial distance and temporal distance between any two points. This presumes that each point has a time stamp associated with it, as with GPS data. T-LoCoH uses TSD rather than Euclidean distance to identify each point's nearest neighbors, resulting in hulls that are localized in both space and time. Hulls are then sorted and progressively unioned into <b>isopleths.</b> Like LoCoH, UDs created by T-LoCoH generally {{do a good job}} modeling sharp edges in habitat such as water bodies; in addition T-LoCoH <b>isopleths</b> can delineate temporal partitions of space use. T-LoCoH also offers additional sorting options for hulls, allowing it to generate <b>isopleths</b> that differentiate internal space by both intensity of use (the conventional UD) and a variety of behavioral proxies, including directionality and time use metrics.|$|R
50|$|With Charles Joseph Minard, another civil {{engineer}} of the Ponts et Chauss√©es, Lalanne {{is considered to}} have made important contributions to rigorous cartography. He first clarified the distinction between an isometric line and an <b>isopleth.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In geography, {{the word}} <b>isopleth</b> (from [...] or plethos, meaning 'quantity') {{is used for}} contour lines that depict a {{variable}} which cannot be measured at a point, but which instead must be calculated from data collected over an area. An example is population density, which can be calculated by dividing the population of a census district by the surface area of that district. Each calculated value is presumed to be {{the value of the}} variable at the centre of the area, and isopleths can then be drawn by a process of interpolation. The idea of an <b>isopleth</b> map can be compared with that of a choropleth map.|$|E
40|$|During {{a period}} {{spanning}} more than 5 years, low elevation radar measurements of rain were systematically {{obtained in the}} mid-Atlantic coast of the U. S. Drop size distribution measurements with a disdrometer were also acquired on the same rain days. The drop size data were utilized to convert the radar reflectivity factors to estimated rain rates for the respective rain days of operation. Applying high level algorithms to the rain data, core values of rain intensities were identified (peak rain rates), and families of rain rate <b>isopleths</b> analyzed. In particular, equicircle diameters {{of the family of}} <b>isopleths</b> enveloping peak rain intensities were statistically characterized. The presented results represents the analysis of two rain days, 12 radar scans, corresponding to 430 culled rain rate <b>isopleths</b> from an available data base of 22, 000 contours, approximately 100 scans encompassing 17 rain days. The results presented show trends of the average rain rate vs. contour scale dimensions, and cumulative distributions of rain cell dimensions which belong to core families of precipitation...|$|R
50|$|This {{phenomenon}} is also inherent in calculating the sound levels from aircraft noise, so that an accurate determination of topographic features may be understood. In that way one can produce sound level <b>isopleths,</b> or contour maps, which faithfully depict outcomes over variable terrain.|$|R
50|$|A second key {{concept is}} that {{movement}} along a buffer line must correspond {{to a change}} in PCO2. Thus, like the <b>isopleths,</b> the buffer line as drawn on a typical Davenport Diagram (e.g., Fig 6) is actually the projection of a line existing in three-dimensional space onto a two-dimensional plane. As with the <b>isopleths,</b> buffer lines in their actual three-dimensional orientation are confined to the surface representing the values of PCO2, HCO3‚àí and pH that satisfy equilibrium for the system. In Fig. 10, the dark red lines are the actual buffer lines in three-dimensional space, while the light red lines are the projections of the buffer lines onto a two-dimensional plane. (We will see later how multiple, parallel buffer lines can be determined for a given system).|$|R
50|$|An isoflor is an <b>isopleth</b> contour {{connecting}} {{areas of}} comparable biological diversity. Usually, the variable {{is the number}} of species of a given genus or family that occurs in a region. Isoflor maps are thus used to show distribution patterns and trends such as centres of diversity.|$|E
5000|$|Recall {{that the}} {{relationship}} represented in a Davenport Diagram is a relationship between three variables: PCO2, bicarbonate concentration and pH.

5000|$|The term isogloss (Ancient Greek [...] √≠sos [...] "equal, similar" [...] and [...] gl≈çssa [...] "tongue, dialect, language") is {{inspired}} by contour lines, or <b>isopleths,</b> such as isobars. However, the isogloss separates rather than connects points. Consequently, it has been proposed for the term heterogloss ( [...] h√©teros [...] "other") to be used instead.|$|R

Along-track, pole-centred cross-sections are used in conjunction with meteorological analyses to reveal several salient features: W-shaped CH 4 <b>isopleths,</b> long-lived ‚Äúfrozen-in‚Äù anticyclones circling the pole, and an Arctic low-ozone pool, that is involved in low column ozone episodes. ...|$|R
50|$|Isarithmic maps, {{also known}} as contour maps or <b>isopleth</b> maps depict smooth {{continuous}} phenomena such as precipitation or elevation. Each line-bounded area on this type of map represents a region with the same value. For example, on an elevation map, each elevation line indicates an area at the listed elevation. An Isarithmic map is a planimetric graphic representation of a 3-D surface. Isarithmic mapping requires 3-D thinking for surfaces that vary spatially.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, from {{a series}} of {{three-dimensional}} points, or digital elevation model, <b>isopleth</b> lines representing elevation contours can be generated, along with slope analysis, shaded relief, and other elevation products. Watersheds can be easily defined for any given reach, by computing all of the areas contiguous and uphill from any given point of interest. Similarly, an expected thalweg of where surface water would want to travel in intermittent and permanent streams can be computed from elevation data in the GIS.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Integration of {{petrographic}} observations, mineral chemistry, garnet Sm-Nd isochrons, and MnNaCaKFMASH pseudosection phase equilibria models {{constructed with}} THERMOCALC provides quantitative metamorphic pressure-temperature-time (P-T- t) paths which allow determination f assemblage/reaction history for pelites. Examples are presented for the Cretaceous to Tertiary magmatic {{arc of the}} North American Coast Plutonic Complex. Metamorphism in the western Coast Plutonic Complex of southeastern Alaska and in the North Cascades of Washington resulted from at least three widespread events from> 100 Ma to c. 60 Ma, and in both areas partly resulted from crustal thickening, evidenced by local occurrences of kyanite after andalusite. Pressure-temperature ps udosections constructed from bulk rock compositions and the intersection of garnet core composition <b>isopleths</b> provide estimates for the pressure and temperature of garnet core growth. Intersections of these <b>isopleths</b> indicate garnet growth 18 to 85 ~ above the predicted garnet-in reaction temperatures.

50|$|A {{nomogram}} {{consists of}} a set of n scales, one for each variable in an equation. Knowing the values of n-1 variables, the value of the unknown variable can be found, or by fixing the values of some variables, the relationship between the unfixed ones can be studied. The result is obtained by laying a straightedge across the known values on the scales and reading the unknown value from where it crosses the scale for that variable. The virtual or drawn line created by the straightedge is called an index line or <b>isopleth.</b>|$|E

5000|$|An isobar (from [...] or baros, meaning 'weight') {{is a line}} {{of equal}} or {{constant}} pressure on a graph, plot, or map; an <b>isopleth</b> or contour line of pressure.More accurately, isobars are lines drawn on a map joining places of equal average atmospheric pressure reduced to sea level for a specified period of time.
