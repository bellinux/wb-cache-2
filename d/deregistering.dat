50|$|The {{judicial}} system is viewed with strong distrust by the population.

50|$|Although {{the memory}} manager can recover {{unreachable}} memory, it cannot free memory {{that is still}} reachable and therefore potentially still useful. Modern memory managers therefore provide techniques for programmers to semantically mark memory with varying levels of usefulness, which correspond to varying levels of reachability. The memory manager does not free an object that is strongly reachable. An object is strongly reachable if it is reachable either directly by a strong reference or indirectly by a chain of strong references. (A strong reference is a reference that, unlike a weak reference, prevents an object from being garbage collected.) To prevent this, the developer is responsible for cleaning up references after use, typically by setting the reference to null once {{it is no longer}} needed and, if necessary, by <b>deregistering</b> any event listeners that maintain strong references to the object.|$|E

5000|$|Congressman Ron Paul {{and others}} such as former Arkansas {{governor}} Mike Huckabee have contended that SOX was an unnecessary and costly government intrusion into corporate management that places U.S. corporations {{at a competitive}} disadvantage with foreign firms, driving businesses out of the United States. In an April 14, 2005 speech before the U.S. House of Representatives, Paul stated, [...] "These regulations are damaging American capital markets by providing an incentive for small US firms and foreign firms to deregister from US stock exchanges. According {{to a study by}} a researcher at the Wharton Business School, the number of American companies <b>deregistering</b> from public stock exchanges nearly tripled during the year after Sarbanes-Oxley became law, while the New York Stock Exchange had only 10 new foreign listings in all of 2004. The reluctance of small businesses and foreign firms to register on American stock exchanges is easily understood when one considers the costs Sarbanes-Oxley imposes on businesses. According to a survey by Korn/Ferry International, Sarbanes-Oxley cost Fortune 500 companies an average of $5.1 million in compliance expenses in 2004, while a study by the law firm of Foley and Lardner found the Act increased costs associated with being a publicly held company by 130 percent." ...|$|E
5000|$|Beverley McLachlin, Chief Justice of the Canadian Supreme Court {{has written}} about Cooke's dictum, [...] "In his prescient way, Lord Cooke {{put his finger on}} a {{question}} that would come to more and more preoccupy the common law world in the years that followed: do judges have the right to invoke fundamental norms to trump written laws? And in his usual forthright way, he staked out his turf on the issue in no uncertain terms. He argued that an independent judiciary is the safeguard of parliamentary democracy, and urged courts not to be afraid to assume their role in protecting certain fundamental principles as essential {{to the rule of law}} and the expression of democratic will, even if these “deep rights” were not in written form."Former Australian High Court Justice Michael Kirby has noted that Cooke's comments reinvigorated the natural law theory that holds certain human rights to be fundamental and inalienable. Kirby has criticised Cooke's comments because, [...] "By challenging the power of Parliament with notions of [...] "deep rights" [...] the judge challenges the democratic character of the system of which the judiciary is part and which sustains the judiciary's own legitimacy." [...] Kirby, was one of the judges in the New South Wales Court of Appeal in 1986 who rejected an argument by the Builders' Labourers Federation relying on Cooke's dictum, that a law <b>deregistering</b> the union and infringing on judicial power, should not be followed as it abrogated the common law right of access to justice.|$|E
