25|$|On 27 April, Bahrain's health {{ministry}} {{declared the}} country {{to be free from}} the flu, citing that pig farms do not exist in the country and that live pork is not imported into the country. On 28 April, Bahraini MPs from the Al Asalah Salafi party called for the prohibition of pork products in the country. On 30 April, Bahrain banned pork imports from the United States and Mexico where the bulk of its imports originate from, with the Ministry of Health stating that the country is taking extra precautions despite the World Health Organisation stating that the flu cannot be contracted via the consumption of pork. The Ministry announced the creation of isolation wards in the country's main hospitals and also recommended that people should avoid <b>hugging</b> <b>and</b> kissing, so as to avoid contact with infected individuals. Also on the same day, it was announced that passengers arriving through the Bahrain International Airport would be screened and would also send suspicious flu patients to isolation wards. It was also announced that pharmacies in the country were stockpiled with enough Tamiflu to cover 20% of the population. A special hotline was also set up.|$|E

500|$|The Indiana {{state health}} commissioner, Dr. Woodrow Myers, who had {{extensive}} experience treating AIDS patients in San Francisco, and the Centers for Disease Control both notified {{the board that}} Ryan posed no risk to other students, but the school board and many parents ignored their statements.

500|$|Executive {{producer}} David Greenwalt {{was very}} keen {{to acquire the}} character of Cordelia for the spin-off series, commenting, [...] "I desperately wanted {{her to come to}} Angel because Angel being dark and broody, we need a big bright smile."

Kelly A. Manners describes Cordelia as a [...] "rich gal whose family ended up losing everything to the IRS. So in episode one of Angel, Cordelia showed up in LA trying to start a career as an actress because her family was in jail, actually." [...] Crusie states that in mourning for Doyle Cordelia also begins [...] "finding within herself a new level of humanity".|$|E

500|$|Urged on by a {{small but}} loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans {{improved}} after the break and, according to Byrom, [...] "ke the Austrian goal under siege" [...] throughout the second half. [...] With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a short corner that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans [...] "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. Gillian Cowley made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's free hit was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [...] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported [...] "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" [...] at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field <b>hugging</b> <b>and</b> kissing each other". Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders and carried her off the field.|$|E

Tom and Wendy are later shown <b>hugging</b> <b>and</b> presumably making amends, although their conversation remains inaudible. Meanwhile, April's (Aubrey Plaza) boyfriend Derek (Blake Lee) and his boyfriend Ben (Josh Duvendeck) mock the senior citizens, causing April to question why their interactions must constantly be [...] "cloaked in like 15 layers of irony". They accuse her of [...] "lameness", which they attribute to spending time with Andy, and provide her with several ultimatums. She breaks up with them in response. Ann (Rashida Jones) and Mark (Paul Schneider), at the same time, celebrate their first Valentine's Day together. In {{an interview with the}} camera crew, Ann describes the relationship as [...] "good", but her tone of voice and body language around Mark contradict her statements. She later becomes jealous when Andy dedicates a song to April, even {{going so far as to}} question April about the possibility of a budding relationship between April and Andy, to which April responds impatiently.|$|E
