40|$|Existing {{literature}} on value creation of divestitures {{focuses on the}} antecedents of divestitures, typically relating them to the parent company’s financial performance. Whether and how divestitures can create value for the <b>divested</b> unit remains unexplored. This study presents an exploratory study based on multiple cases, to examine which factors of the implementation and structuring of a divestiture may increase {{the performance of a}} <b>divested</b> unit. The emergent granular framework consists of previously unreported aspects of the <b>divesting</b> process and provides new insights into divestitures and their outcomes. Results indicate that antecedents alone may be insufficient for understanding the outcomes of divestitures. Sense of opportunity emerges as the key element of the <b>divesting</b> process for the success of <b>divested</b> units. Different combinations of understanding and perceived capabilities in the <b>divesting</b> process affect the perception of feasibility of the operation and the success of the <b>divested</b> unit. Factors that concur with sense of opportunity in determining the success of <b>divested</b> units are further considered in the theoretical framework...|$|R

30|$|<b>Divesting</b> {{firms are}} the most broadly {{applicable}} unit of analysis with which to address why firms undertake divestitures and what implications divestitures have for firm performance, since one can readily observe whether <b>divesting</b> firms systematically display particular characteristics or experience certain performance trajectories. The biggest challenge with using <b>divesting</b> firms as {{the unit of analysis}} is the identification of a relevant counterfactual against which to benchmark these companies. More specifically, while one might hypothesize that certain firms are more likely to undertake divestitures or that performance improves when companies undertake divestitures (or particular types of divestitures), the questions that flow directly out of these predictions are “more likely to undertake divestitures relative to which firms?” and “performance improves relative to what?” Comparable firms that do not undertake divestitures are a useful counterfactual (Feldman 2015 b), as are companies that retain business units that are comparable to those that the <b>divesting</b> firms <b>divested</b> (Feldman 2014).|$|R
