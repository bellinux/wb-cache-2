5|$|At higher altitudes {{the trees}} {{gradually}} thin out {{and there are}} alpine pastures. These pastures are rich in flowers in the late spring. The wildflowers in the park's high meadows include wild pansies, <b>gentians,</b> martagon lilies, and alpenroses. The park has many rocky habitats. They are mostly located above the timberline and alpine pastures. These areas have rock and detritus on their surface. Alpine plants have adapted to these habitats by assuming characteristics like dwarfism, hairiness, bright coloured flowers, and highly developed roots. About 1,500 plant species {{can be seen at}} Paradisia Pyromaniacle Garden near Cogne inside the park.|$|E
5|$|Settlers cleared {{much of the}} Catlins' coastal {{vegetation}} for farmland, but in {{some areas}} the original coastal plant life survives, primarily around cliff edges {{and some of the}} bays close to the Tautuku Peninsula, these being furthest from the landward edges of the forest. Plant life here includes many native species adapted to the strong salt-laden winds found in this exposed region. The Catlins coastal daisy (Celmisia lindsayii) is unique to the region, and is related to New Zealand's mountain daisies. Tussocks, hebes, and flaxes are common, as are native <b>gentians,</b> though sadly the endangered native sedge pingao can now rarely be found. In years when the southern rātā flowers well, the coastal forest canopy turns bright red. The rātā also thrives in some inland areas.|$|E

50|$|Despite the {{perception}} that the spirit is produced with <b>gentian</b> flowers (which are depicted in the labeling by many producers), <b>Gentian</b> is actually produced using <b>gentian</b> root, most commonly the yellow <b>gentian,</b> which is a larger variety. Less commonly, the roots from other flowers from the <b>Gentian</b> genus are used, such as the purple <b>gentian,</b> brown <b>gentian,</b> or spotted <b>gentian.</b> The harvesting of <b>gentian</b> from the wild is strictly controlled; as a result, fields are planted with the specific purpose of being harvested. In both the EU and Switzerland, the alcoholic strength of <b>Gentian</b> must be at least 37.5 percent alcohol by volume.|$|R

25|$|Plant life {{along the}} Kishwaukee is abundant. Various native flora from burr oaks, and lady's {{slippers}} to lousewort, and trilliums to trout lilies.

Of that number 14 are listed as endangered in Illinois and another 14 as threatened in the state as of 1997. In addition the prairie bush clover is a federally threatened species that occurs in the basin.|$|E
500|$|Flowers and gardens: Farr {{notes that}} Dickinson's [...] "poems and letters almost wholly concern flowers" [...] and that allusions to gardens often refer to an [...] "imaginative realm ... wherein flowers [...] often emblems for actions and emotions".

Her poems were often sent to friends with accompanying letters and nosegays. Farr notes {{that one of}} Dickinson's earlier poems, written about 1859, appears to [...] "conflate her poetry itself with the posies": [...] "My nosegays are for Captives–/ Dim– long expectant eyes–/ Fingers denied the plucking,/ Patient till Paradise–/ To such, if they sh'd whisper/ Of morning and the moor–/ They bear no other errand,/ And I, no other prayer".|$|E
