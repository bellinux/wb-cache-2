5000|$|<b>Ketorfanol</b> (INN, USAN) (developmental {{code name}} SBW-22), or ketorphanol, is an opioid {{analgesic}} of the morphinan family {{that was found}} to possess [...] "potent antiwrithing activity" [...] in animal assays but was never marketed. It is a 17-cycloalkylmethyl derivative of morphinan and as such, is closely related structurally to butorphanol, cyclorphan, oxilorphan, proxorphan, and xorphanol, which act preferentially as κ-opioid receptor agonists {{and to a lesser}} extent as μ-opioid receptor partial agonists/antagonists.|$|E
