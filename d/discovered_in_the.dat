5|$|A {{number of}} supernovae have been {{discovered}} in Coma Berenices. Four (SN 1940B, SN 1969H, SN 1987E and SN 1999gs) were in the NGC 4725 galaxy, and another four were <b>discovered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> M99 galaxy (NGC 4254): SN 1967H, SN 1972Q, SN 1986I and SN 2014L.

SN 1940B, discovered on 5 May 1940, was the first observed type II supernova. SN 2005ap, discovered on 3 March 2005, is the brightest known supernova to date with a peak absolute magnitude of about −22.7. Due to its great distance from Earth (4.7 billion light-years), it was not {{visible to the naked}} eye and was discovered telescopically. SN1979C, discovered in 1979, retained its original X-ray brightness for 25 years despite fading in visible light.|$|E
5|$|As objects {{increasingly}} {{closer in}} size to Pluto were <b>discovered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region, it was argued that Pluto should be reclassified {{as one of the}} Kuiper belt objects, just as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta lost their planet status after the discovery of many other asteroids. On July 29, 2005, astronomers at Caltech announced the discovery of a new trans-Neptunian object, Eris, which was substantially more massive than Pluto and the most massive object <b>discovered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System since Triton in 1846. Its discoverers and the press initially called it the tenth planet, although there was no official consensus at the time on whether to call it a planet. Others in the astronomical community considered the discovery the strongest argument for reclassifying Pluto as a minor planet.|$|E
