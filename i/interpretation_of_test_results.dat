She authored many books {{including the first}} book pertaining to school psychology titled, [...] "Psychological Service for School Problems" [...] written in 1930. The book discussed applying the science of psychology to address the perceived problems in schools. The main focus of the book was on applied educational psychology to improve learning outcomes. Hildreth listed 11 problems that can be solved by applying psychological techniques, including: instructional problems in the classroom, assessment of achievement, <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> <b>results,</b> instructional groupings of students for optimal outcomes, vocational guidance, curriculum development, and investigations of exceptional pupils.Hildreth {{emphasized the importance of}} collaboration with parents and teachers. She is also known for her development of the Metropolitan Readiness Tests and for her contribution to the Metropolitan Achievement test. In 1933 and 1939 Hildreth published a bibliography of Mental Tests and Rating Scales encompassing a 50-year time period and over 4,000 titles. She wrote approximately 200 articles and bulletins and had an international reputation for her work in education.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of the process-oriented approach, clinical neuropsychological assessment followed a fixed-battery global-achievement approach, and stressed quantitative <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> <b>results</b> (for example the Halstead-Reitan battery). The process-oriented approach offered advances in test interpretation, stressing the qualitative aspects of patients' performance profiles. The Boston Process Approach examines the qualitative process by which the patient solves a problem rather than simply looking at the patient's quantitative numerical scores. The Boston Process also tailors which tests to give a patient instead of administering an entire test battery to every subject, regardless of their condition. This alternative approach improved clinical understanding of brain functions and generated discussion about diagnostic issues in clinical neuropsychology.|$|E

50|$|Statements {{like those}} in AS3850, “Because of the mode in which failure can occur, it may be {{necessary}} to test complete systems and not calculate values obtained from a group of components that make up the system. The mode of failure of an individual component does not necessarily reflect the mode of failure of the system.” But the standard does not continue to further the understanding required regarding test methods, the components that should be deemed as part of the system, the various modes of failure, and the <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> <b>results</b> for each failure mode.And further in AS3850, “The strength limit state capacity shall be determined by a statistical analysis from the test results in accordance with Paragraph A4.5.” and assuming the test data is taken from a statistically valid test method, the data is to be determined via statistical means to derive the Load resistance model, for the anchor.There are adequate load case coefficients available to estimate sling angle load amplification, suction from the casting bed, and various dynamic transportation load estimates.Load resistance factors of safety, FOS, set out in the Australian Code would typically denote a FOS of 5.0 for re-usable lifting equipment and an FOS of 2.5 for a lifting anchors.The rigging arrangements can influence the applied anchor load, where statically indeterminate systems are not necessarily a design consideration, but can be used in practice. The determination of the loads through the rigging system must be a consideration whilst calculating the load resistant model, refer to the examples shown in Figure 3.|$|E

5000|$|The {{assessment}} {{standard of}} the APA ethical standards is developed to broadly address guidelines on assessments. This standard {{states that the}} psychologist's views should be supported by findings from assessments, while reporting the limitations of assessments. If a viewpoint {{is not based on}} assessment results, psychologists should provide evidence to justify their judgment. Psychologists are responsible for using valid and reliable assessments that are administered in a preferred language by the client. Informed consent is expected to be obtained in accordance to the guidelines on the [...] "Informed Consent" [...] standard, unless the assessment is required by the law, a routine practice or required to test for the ability to make decisions. Psychologists using an interpreter are expected to obtain informed consent from the client for the use of an interpreter as well as maintain confidentiality and test security. Psychologists may refrain from releasing test data in order to protect a participant. Psychologists are also responsible for developing valid and reliable assessments and interpreting test results by taking other factors that may influence the interpretations while also indicating any limitations associated with the interpretations. Psychologists are required to be appropriately trained in order to administer assessments and are responsible for using current tests. Psychologists are also responsible for providing necessary information when outsourcing interpretation and the <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> <b>results.</b> Psychologists are required to explain the test results to the client or other identified persons, unless otherwise specified. Psychologists are also required to maintain security and integrity in regards to all test material.|$|E

40|$|IIn {{this paper}} {{durability}} {{is defined as}} the capacity to prevent deterioration with time. Deterioration occurs when the (with time changing) capacity of masonry becomes insufficient to withstand environmental attacks of an unpredictable nature. The authors have modelled the very complex interaction phenomena by an appropriate stochastic process combined with accelerating testing under controlled conditions. The testing method is based on stress cycles generated by a weathering process, e. g. salt crystallisation and/or ice formation. As a reference for deterioration under real environmental conditions, a full-scale outdoor-exposure model is used of which the ground-water composition is controlled, e. g. the salt content. It is demonstrated that the probabilistic model leads to (mixed) Weibull distributed lifetimes. The testing procedure as well as the statistical <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> <b>results</b> have reached, after many years of research, the application stage...|$|R
