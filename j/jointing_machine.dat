40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effect of}} experimentally evaluated nonlinearities in a <b>machine</b> <b>joint</b> on the overall machine tool dynamic performance using frequency response functions and stability lobe diagrams. Typical <b>machine</b> <b>joints</b> are very stiff and have weak nonlinearities. The experimental evaluation of the nonlinear joint parameters of a commercial translational guide has been discussed in Dhupia et al., 2007, J. Vibr. Control, accepted. Those results {{are used in the}} current paper to represent the connection between the column and the spindle of an idealized column-spindle machine structure. The goal is to isolate and understand the effects of such <b>joints</b> on the <b>machine</b> tool dynamic performance. The nonlinear receptance coupling approach is used to evaluate the frequency response function, which is then used to evaluate the stability lobe diagrams for an idealized machine structure. Despite the weak nonlinearities in the joint, significant shifts in the natural frequency and amplitudes at resonance can be observed at different forcing amplitudes. These changes in the structural dynamics, in turn, can lead to significant changes in the location of chatter stability lobes with respect to spindle speed. These variations in frequency response function and stability lobe diagram of machine tools due to nonlinearities in the structure are qualitatively verified by conducting impact hammer tests at different force amplitudes on a machine tool. �DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 2752830...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Prediction {{of machine}} {{dynamics}} {{at the design stage}} {{is a challenge}} due to lack of adequate methods for identifying and handling the nonlinearities in the <b>machine</b> <b>joints,</b> which appear as the nonlinear restoring force function of relative displacement and relative velocity across the joint. This paper discusses identification of such a nonlinear restoring force function for an industrial translational guide for use with the Nonlinear Receptance Coupling Approach (NLRCA) to evaluate machine dynamic characteristics. Translational guides are among the most commonly used <b>joints</b> in <b>machine</b> tools. Both parametric and nonparametric techniques have been employed to identify the nonlinearities. A novel parametric model based on Hertzian contact mechanics has been derived for the translational guide. A nonparametric method based on twodimensional Chebyshev polynomials is also used. The models derived from the two techniques, i. e., parametric and nonparametric, are fitted to the experimental data derived from static and dynamic tests to get the restoring force as a function of relative displacement and relative velocity across the joint. The nonlinear representation obtained from both techniques is later converted into the describing function representation which is needed for evaluation of machine dynamic characteristics using the NLRCA. The describing function representations obtained from the two approaches are compared. The design of experiments for evaluating the nonlinearities in such industrial <b>machine</b> tool <b>joints</b> is a challenge, requiring careful alignment and calibration...|$|R

So far, literature seems to neglect this effect. To explore this issue we develop queueing theoretical approximations of flow times for a simple two-stage shop. It appears that the optimal batch size for the shop is typically smaller than the optimal batch size for the batch machine. Furthermore, we propose extensions to existing dispatching rules by using information on successor stages. Existing and new extended rules are tested by an extensive simulation study. In line with the queueing theoretical analysis the outcomes indicate that exhaustive rules - assuming batch size to be equal to family queue length - are clearly outperformed by non-exhaustive rules - allowing for smaller batches. Moreover, results show that the inclusion of local information on successor stages in rule decision making improves shop flow times...|$|R
