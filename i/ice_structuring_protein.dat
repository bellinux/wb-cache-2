40|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>structuring</b> <b>proteins</b> (ISPs) protect organisms from {{damage or}} death by {{freezing}}. They depress the non-equilibrium freezing point {{of water and}} prevent recrystallization, probably by binding {{to the surface of}} ice crystals. Many ISPs have been described and it is likely that many more exist in nature that have not yet been identified. ISPs come in many forms and thus cannot be reliably identified by their structure or consensus ice-binding motifs. Recombinant protein expression is the gold standard for proving the activity of a candidate ISP. Among existing expression systems, cell-free protein expression is the simplest and gives the fastest access to the protein of interest, but selection of the appropriate cell-free expression system is crucial for functionality. Here we describe cell-free expression methods for three ISPs that differ widely in structure and glycosylation status from three organisms: a fish (Macrozoarces americanus), an insect (Dendroides canadensis) and an alga (Chlamydomonas sp. CCMP 681). We use both prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems for the production of ISPs. An ice recrystallization inhibition assay is used to test functionality. The techniques described here should improve the success of cell-free expression of ISPs in future applications...|$|R

Macro- and microstructural observations are considered, along with temperature conditions recorded at a nearby meteorological station and directly within the <b>ice</b> <b>structure.</b> They reveal that vertical structures initially grow rapidly from the aggregation of stalactites with microstructures indicative of temperature conditions during their crystallization.

At the end of the season, the collapse of the free-standing structure does not occur by progressive melting, but is initiated by a horizontal crack propagation at the top. The initiation of this crack seems to be triggered by a drastic temperature decrease...|$|R

To do this, we have developed a quasi 3 D model of a cometary nucleus which takes into account all phase changes and water <b>ice</b> <b>structures</b> (amorphous, crystalline, clathrate, and a mixture of them); we have applied this model to the comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the target of the Rosetta mission.

40|$|Step {{frequency}} radar {{experiments have}} been carried out on sea ice near Syowa Station as part of the 27 th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition to develop an airborne sensor for measuring vertical sea <b>ice</b> <b>structures.</b> Step frequency radar has characteristics of high resolution and low frequency (UHF band), which is an advantage in measuring sea ice. The experiments are the first application of this radar for measuring sea ice thickness.

The sI CO 2 hydrate transformed at 0. 7 GPa {{into the high}} pressure phase that had been observed previously by Hirai et al. [J. Phys. Chem. 133, 124511 (2010) ] and Bollengier et al. [Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 119, 322 (2013) ], but which had not been structurally identified. The current neutron diffraction data were successfully fitted to a filled <b>ice</b> <b>structure</b> with CO 2 molecules filling the water channels. This CO 2 +water system has also been investigated using classical molecular dynamics and density functional ab initio methods to provide additional characterization of the high pressure structure. Both models indicate the water network adapts a MH-III "like" filled <b>ice</b> <b>structure</b> with considerable disorder of the orientations of the CO 2 molecule. Furthermore, the disorder {{appears to be a}} direct result of the level of proton disorder in the water network. In contrast to the conclusions of Bollengier et al., our neutron diffraction data show that the filled ice phase can be recovered to ambient pressure (0. 1 MPa) at 96 K, and recrystallization to sI hydrate occurs upon subsequent heating to 150 K, possibly by first forming low density amorphous ice.
