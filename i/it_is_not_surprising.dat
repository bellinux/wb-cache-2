5|$|Considering Ragnvald's background, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that he rose {{to become}} {{an officer of the}} Varangian Guard: he was a wealthy {{chieftain}} who brought many ambitious soldiers to Greece.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> {{then that}} Kaiser, Hunka, and Bianchini (1971) {{concluded}} that the affective symptoms of depression are less specific and appear to shift from loading on one dimension to another {{depending on the type}} of sample being studied.|$|E
5|$|Since {{they are}} morally equivalent, perhaps <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that {{the cure for}} {{political}} injustices {{is identical to the}} cure for economic ones: namely, the institution of democracy in both economic and political spheres (Russell 1938:234).|$|E
50|$|As a Liberal, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> when Hutchinson {{came out}} in support of Irish Home Rule.|$|R
25|$|So <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that he <b>was</b> {{asked to}} serve within the new founded Austrian Scout organisation.|$|R
50|$|Given {{that this}} seat had <b>been</b> Liberal since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> created in 1885, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that the Conservatives did not contest the seat. Walter Moore stood as an Independent.|$|R
5|$|The {{fine for}} {{neglecting}} fyrd, {{the obligation to}} do military service for the king, is set at 120 shillings for a nobleman, and 30 shillings for a ceorl, incidentally revealing that ceorls were required {{to serve in the}} army. Scholars have disagreed on the military value of the ceorl, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that all free men would fight, since defeat might have meant slavery.|$|E
5|$|Before the reform, in {{the north}} of the empire the Nuremberg {{standard}} had been in effect, and in Italy the local standards had been even lighter. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that an increase by 17% and more met with some inertia. The 1770 edition of the pharmacopoeia Dispensatorium Austriaco-Viennense still used the Nuremberg standard libra medicinalis minor, indicating that even in the Austrian capital Vienna it took some time for the reform to become effective. In 1774, the Pharmacopoea Austriaco-provincialis used the new standard, and in 1783 all old apothecaries' weight pieces that were still in use were directed to be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|As Australia won {{the series}} convincingly 4–0, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that their players {{dominated}} the statistical rankings. Australian batsmen scored eight centuries to four by their English counterparts and scored their runs {{at a much}} higher average. Six of the nine highest averaging batsmen were Australian. On the bowling front, Australia's pace attack had far more success and they were {{a large part of the}} success. Lindwall and Johnston both took 27 wickets, supported by Miller and Toshack, who took 13 and 11 respectively. For England, only Bedser with 18 was able to take 10 or more wickets, and at a substantially higher cost than the Australian pacemen. The bowling was dominated by pace bowling, with Laker being the only spinner on the list, with by far the worst average. This was in large part because England agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs, more frequently than under normal conditions. As a new ball is more conducive to fast bowling, this favoured fast bowlers and therefore the team with the best pace attack, in this case Australia.|$|E
6000|$|... "Or may be twal; just as likely." [...] And Mr. Gowran {{shook his}} head at his {{mistress}} in a most uncomfortable way. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that she should hate him.|$|R
50|$|Author Saul Bellow once {{observed}} that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising,</b> {{with all the}} revision that goes into a work, that an author might appear better on the page than in real life.|$|R
50|$|As the Commodore 64 {{featured}} a digitally controlled semi-analogue synthesizer as its sound processor, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> to discover {{an abundance of}} software and hardware designed to expand upon its capabilities.|$|R
25|$|Given the {{emotional}} support connection and happiness dogs provide <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> {{that people want}} to honor and reward them with goodies.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanisms}} of subjective tinnitus are often obscure. While <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that direct {{trauma to the}} inner ear can cause tinnitus, other apparent causes (e.g., temporomandibular joint dysfunction) are difficult to explain.|$|E
25|$|The film {{industry}} in Azerbaijan {{dates back to}} 1898. In fact, Azerbaijan {{was among the first}} countries involved in cinematography: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that this new medium soon showed up in cosmopolitan nouveau-riche Baku {{at the turn of the}} 19th century.|$|E
60|$|After that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that Isabel {{should ask}} for a lift in our car {{as far as the}} Lurky Committee Room, and that she should offer me quite sound advice EN ROUTE upon the {{intellectual}} temperament of the Lurky gasworkers.|$|R
25|$|A learned man, Hungerford placed much {{emphasis}} on education. Hence, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that his main focus in Congress was serving on the Committee of Education and Labor. After his short stint on Capital Hill, he returned to Corning, New York to resume his banking business.|$|R
30|$|Previous {{studies of}} {{postnatal}} depression have consistently found {{stressful life events}} to be risk factors and few studies have found no association. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> therefore, that the phenomenon of stress was mentioned by most practitioners and was strongly implicit in responses from the mothers groups.|$|R
25|$|In the 1961–1962 season, the Duleep Trophy {{was inaugurated}} as a zonal competition. It {{was named after}} Ranji's nephew, Kumar Shri Duleepsinhji (1905–59). With Bombay in its catchment, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that the West Zone won six of the first nine titles.|$|E
25|$|Precisely {{because he}} had {{submitted}} to Brian's authority, the King of Leinster was overthrown in 998 and replaced by Máel Mórda mac Murchada. Given {{the circumstances under which}} Máel Mórda had been appointed, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that he launched an open rebellion against Brian's authority.|$|E
25|$|Pynson became King's Printer to Henry VII (and {{subsequently}} to Henry VIII) in 1506, {{an office}} that carried not only great prestige {{but also an}} annuity of two pounds, later raised to four pounds. Since this was a prestigious lifetime position, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that he was naturalised in 1513.|$|E
50|$|A learned man, Hungerford placed much {{emphasis}} on education.

50|$|Both {{were born}} in 1866 and were the {{graduates}} of the Central School, the present Queen's College, in 1886. <b>Being</b> schoolmates, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that Dr Sun and Ho Kom Tong were acquaintances. Ho's elder brother, Sir Robert Ho Tung, even rendered support towards Dr Sun's revolutionary activities.|$|R
60|$|Benicia nodded. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> {{that there}} <b>was</b> a certain vein of vindictiveness in her, which {{rendered}} {{it easy for}} her to sympathize with him, and once more the man noticed that where Ada Ratcliffe would in all probability have listened with half-disdainful impatience she showed comprehension.|$|R
25|$|Given his record, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> {{that the}} other Party leaders were {{suspicious}} of Beria's motives. Khrushchev opposed the alliance between Beria and Malenkov, but he was initially unable to challenge them. His opportunity came in June 1953 when a spontaneous uprising against the East German Communist regime broke out in East Berlin.|$|E
25|$|This was no fashionable affectation; {{this was}} {{something}} that belonged at the heart of what it was to be Dorian, and therefore Macedonian, and had more in common with the Theban Sacred Band than with Athens. In light of this, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that there are many indications that their sexual relationship was indeed lifelong.|$|E
25|$|N-oxides {{are prone}} to undergo the Polonovski {{rearrangement}} when treated with acetic anhydride, and this was illustrated by the synthesis of oxazepam. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that the N-methyl analogue (1) also undergoes this process, and hydrolysis of the resulting acetate gives temazepam (2). Care must be exacted with the conditions, or the inactive rearrangement product (3) results.|$|E
50|$|Based on {{its history}} and location, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that the {{government}} established Fort Hero in 1942 on the point {{just south of the}} lighthouse. The fort was named after Major General Andrew Hero, Jr., who was the Army's Chief of Coast Artillery between 1926 and 1930. He died in 1942.|$|R
5000|$|As {{editorial}} head of Vatican Radio, {{he worked}} on the election of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger as Pope Benedict XVI. He had previously studied Tübingen [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that he <b>is</b> one of the first exclusive interview with the new Pope. This was also the first personal interview with a pope.|$|R
50|$|According to {{an account}} from James Allan, an officer aboard the U.S.-flagged supply ship Columbia, who {{witnessed}} the battle, rumors abounded that Admiral Ding deferred command to Major Constantin von Hannecken. He opined that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that the Chinese had suffered such losses if an army officer was directing a naval fleet.|$|R
25|$|The {{mention of}} the Dvina river is in good {{agreement}} with the Wielbark Culture. Historically, the Goths followed the Vistula, but during the Viking Age, the Dvina-Dniepr waterway succeeded the Vistula as the main trade route to Greece for the Gutes (or Gotar in standard Old Norse), and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that it also replaced the Vistula in the migration traditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{topographic}} location {{marks the}} Glauberg {{as a long-term}} focus of human activity. It combines access to fertile arable land and water with an easily defensible site and a strategic location along several natural traffic routes. Thus, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that the hill {{was the site of}} human occupation long before and long after its Celtic phase, well into the medieval period.|$|E
25|$|Jealousy {{refers to}} the thoughts, feelings, and {{behaviors}} that occur when a person believes a valued relationship is threatened by a rival. A jealous person experiences anxiety about maintaining support, intimacy, and other valued qualities of her or his relationship. Given that attachment relates to anxiety regulation, support, and intimacy, as discussed above, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that attachment also relates to jealousy.|$|E
50|$|Manuel Tinio {{was also}} {{a very good friend}} of Manuel Quezon and Sergio Osmeña, the Speaker of the National Assembly and the most {{powerful}} Filipino in the political scene at that time. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising,</b> therefore, that Manuel Tinio was included in the Independence Mission that went to Washington D. C. in 1921.|$|R
50|$|There was {{no history}} of any parties {{representing}} the Labour movement intervening in any Edinburgh seats since their creation for the 1885 general election. So <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that the Labour Party honoured the wartime electoral truce and failed to stand a candidate. The Conservatives, as partners in the wartime coalition, also declined to stand.|$|R
50|$|He {{had already}} been sent out on loan to Stoke City (9 games, 2 goals) and Wolverhampton Wanderers (11 games, 3 goals) during the 1993-94 and 1994-95 seasons, and thus <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that, after <b>not</b> {{appearing}} at all {{during the first half}} of the 1995-96 season, Walters was allowed to leave, joining Southampton on 18 January 1996 on a free transfer.|$|R
