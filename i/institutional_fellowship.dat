40|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopy (TEM) in situ ion implantation is a convenient way to study radiation damage, {{but it is}} biased by {{the proximity of the}} free surfaces of the electron transparent thin sample. In this work this bias was investigated by performing irradiation of Fe in thin foil and bulk form with ions of energies between 50 keV and 100 keV using molecular dynamics simulations. The damage resulting from the subsequent displacement cascades differs significantly between the two sample geometries. The most remarkable difference is in the resulting 〈 1 0 0 〉 vacancy loops. Both their size and frequency are much greater in thin films, with loops reaching 4 nm in size. This is due to an imbalance between the number of vacancies and self-interstitials produced, since the faster self-interstitials can escape to the surfaces and remain there as ad-atoms. In addition, the self-interstitial clusters are smaller for thin foils and there is a larger dispersion of the induced damage in terms of defect number, defect clustering and defect morphology. The study discusses the impact of these results on the study of radiation effects during in situ experiments.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is to examine the surge in the {{development}} of post-PharmD industry fellowships (ie, pharmacy fellowship programs sponsored by the biopharmaceutical or pharmaceutical industry). These post-PharmD training programs do not fit the currently accepted definition of a pharmacy fellowship; therefore, the authors propose a new and distinct definition to encompass these fellowships. The authors provide program examples to showcase the establishment of the post-PharmD industry <b>fellowship</b> <b>institutional</b> centers. Finally, the authors provide recommendations to create uniformity in the programs of this relatively new category of post-PharmD training...|$|R
40|$|The NKX 2 - 1 {{transcription}} factor, a regulator {{of normal}} lung development, {{is the most}} significantly amplified gene in human lung adenocarcinoma. To study the transcriptional impact of NKX 2 - 1 amplification, we generated an expression signature associated with NKX 2 - 1 amplification in human lung adenocarcinoma and analyzed DNA-binding sites of NKX 2 - 1 by genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation. Integration of these expression and cistromic analyses identified LMO 3, itself encoding a transcription regulator, as a candidate direct transcriptional target of NKX 2 - 1. Further cistromic and overexpression analyses indicated that NKX 2 - 1 can cooperate with the forkhead box transcription factor FOXA 1 to regulate LMO 3 gene expression. RNAi analysis of NKX 2 - 1 -amplified cells compared with nonamplified cells demonstrated that LMO 3 mediates cell survival downstream from NKX 2 - 1. Our findings provide new insight into the transcriptional regulatory network of NKX 2 - 1 and suggest that LMO 3 is a transcriptional signal transducer in NKX 2 - 1 -amplified lung adenocarcinomas.

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} if the graduation rates of students of color and majority students at public, research extensive and intensive institutions could be predicted by institutional resource allocation activities in the context of both the internal and external environments of universities. The independent variables for the internal environment were expenditures in regard to instruction, academic support, student services, <b>institutional</b> grants (scholarships, <b>fellowships),</b> research, public service, institutional support, plant operation and maintenance, and institutional selectivity. The independent variables for the external environment were geographical region and degree of urbanization. The independent variables for the internal environment were calculated in two ways: (1) the actual dollars spent per student in each expenditures category and (2) the percentage each category represented of the institution 2 ̆ 7 s total E 2 ̆ 6 G expenditures. The dependent variables were the six-year cohort (undergraduate) graduation rates of students disaggregated according to race as well as the overall student graduation rates. IPEDS and Education Trust 2 ̆ 7 s Online Graduation Survey provided the data for the study. This study examined the graduation rates for two successive cohorts of students;Results indicated that institutional expenditures did have an important effect on graduation rates. The one consistently important finding in this study is the importance of research expenditures in affecting the graduation rates of students of color and majority students at public, research extensive and intensive institutions;The results of this study may have important implications for university administrators, such as providing support for the increase in research expenditures. By focusing on disaggregated data for graduation rates, this study broke new ground in identifying what institutional expenditures had an effect on the graduation rates of which undergraduate student group based on race/ethnicity. This study also identified the important role of urbanization in society and its effect on the graduation rates of all students, students of color and majority students. In view of demographic changes taking place in U. S. society in the 21 st century, further research may need {{to be done in the}} areas identified in this study: institutional research expenditures, geographical regions and degree of urbanization...|$|R
