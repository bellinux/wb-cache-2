This paper addresses the benefits of telematic services and mobile & wireless devices such as vital sign sensors and head mounted cameras for healthcare processes. It explores the telematic requirements for a distributed healthcare environment of body area networks of the mobile devices which are connected by wireless (public) networks (e. g.

Our main contribution is the development of enterprise models, which are expressed in terms of the unified modelling language, for the purpose of identification and justification of the <b>telematic</b> <b>system</b> requirements. The developed enterprise models separate organizational modelling concerns such as the separation of medical roles from the agents acting in these roles. This separation enables roles to be dispatched virtually to a point of care without transporting along with all the agents, but it requires support of a <b>telematic</b> <b>system</b> to bridge the distance gap.

We propose an optimization model to support a more informed decision before investing in a multiple service transport <b>telematic</b> <b>system.</b> The model evaluates the possible choices of services and architectures, and aims to maximize the total net societal benefit.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is the {{assessment}} of <b>telematic</b> <b>systems</b> for road freight transport from a planning perspective. The aim is to support strategic decisions related to architectural choices for such systems, with the possibility to achieve synergies by supporting multiple telematic services. The past decade has witnessed enormous growth in cargo volumes resulting in increasing demand for transport capacity. To match this increasing demand only with expansion of infrastructure, e. g. road and vehicles, {{does not seem to}} be a sustainable strategy. One of the few approaches with the potential to improve the use of current transport capacity is the integrated use of modern information and communication technology, otherwise known as <b>telematic</b> <b>systems</b> for road transport, an important component within Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). This type of systems can deliver multiple services that can be used to improve the efficiency and safety of road freight transport. However, attempts to unleash the potential of <b>telematic</b> <b>systems</b> and make maximum possible use of the available transport capacity have been hindered by several challenges ranging from planning and design to development and deployment. Considering the large scope of possible telematic services that can potentially be deployed in road freight transport, this thesis suggests a framework in order to enable structured assessment of <b>telematic</b> <b>systems.</b> Based on the suggested framework, a set of potential transport telematic services are identified and a method for quantifying the value of the services to society is developed. The suggested method takes into account the expected impact on different transportation challenges, such as accidents, fuel consumption, and infrastructure maintenance. Quantitative methods are provided for studying the value of services sharing a common infrastructure. Using quantified benefits of services and costs of various functionalities required by telematic services, the concept of a multi-service architecture is investigated using optimization methods, which handles the multi-dimensional relations between different services that are otherwise difficult to analyze with traditional cost-benefit analysis. The analyses show which telematic services can be achieved with different approaches, such as vehicle-to-vehicle communication, vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, etc. Although multi-service architectures are promising, several challenges need to be overcome, including security, service quality, privacy, and business models. The knowledge gained from the work presented in this thesis can be valuable for different stakeholders, such as governments, service providers, and transport service users, in fostering the planning, design, development, and deployment of <b>telematic</b> <b>systems</b> in transport...|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} {{assessing}} potential synergies among {{different sets of}} transport telematic services (TTSs) is suggested. An Intelligent Transport System enhances transport by delivering one or more TTSs. The ability to deliver multiple TTSs to address {{a wide range of}} stakeholder needs is gaining momentum, not only from a marketing perspective but also from a technological perspective. The total cost of TTSs can be reduced if they share functionalities (i. e., sub-services provided by <b>telematic</b> <b>systems).</b> We show how this synergy can be assessed with the help of clustering methods. Knowledge about possible synergies of functionalities is useful in the (re) design and eventual deployment of TTSs, especially when the underlying <b>telematic</b> <b>systems</b> are able to support multiple TTSs. To adapt the clustering method for this purpose, we suggest a mathematical formulation of synergy among functionalities of TTSs. By applying the method to a set of 32 TTSs, we obtain a cluster formation of these TTSs according to their synergy measures. Overall, the results suggest that the joint implementation of TTSs targeted toward some problem domains can lead to significant cost savings, for example, Road User Charging, Infrastructure Repair and Maintenance, and Information on the Transport of extra large goods for the management of road transport infrastructure...|$|R
