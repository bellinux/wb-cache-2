5000|$|The term [...] "false cognate" [...] is {{sometimes}} misused {{to refer to}} false friends, but the two phenomena are distinct. False friends occur when two words in different languages or dialects look similar, but have different meanings. While some false friends are also <b>false</b> <b>cognates,</b> many are genuine cognates (see False friends § Causes). For example, English pretend and French prétendre are false friends, but not <b>false</b> <b>cognates,</b> as {{they have the same}} origin. A related phenomenon is the expressive loan, which looks like a native construction, but is not.|$|E
