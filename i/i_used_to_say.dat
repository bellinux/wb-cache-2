I would at this moment rather have one Me 262 in action rather than five Bf 109s. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> three 109s, but the situation develops and changes.|$|E
500|$|As well {{as being}} tragic, Dot is scripted as a comic character. Brown has {{discussed}} the humour she incorporates into her performances: [...] "I think Dot would be awfully boring if she weren't a bit comic [...] I always thought I had to put an edge on it, an edge of comedy, which just means doing it more seriously than you would do. If {{you want to play}} comedy then {{you have to be very}} intense about it [...] very, very serious." [...] Some of Dot's catchphrases are used for humour, such as [...] "Ooh I say!", uttered when she is [...] "stuck for words". In 2004, Brown discussed the origin of the saying: [...] "It was written once in the script and I quite enjoyed it, so <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it occasionally when it wasn't in the scripts. It was useful because it could be said in all different ways. Dot's very straight-laced, so it helped to express her horror at what went on." [...] Brown revealed in 2008 that she has tried to cut down the use of this, along with the mispronunciation of her employer, Mr Papadopolous, as she has become a little embarrassed by them now they are so known. Mr. Papadopolous is the owner of the launderette where Dot works. In a long-running joke, Dot has difficulty pronouncing his surname, and for much of the show's history he has been referred to as Mr. Oppodopolus, Oppydoppy, or varying other mispronunciations. Brown has said she enjoys playing the comical aspects of Dot, stating, [...] "She's not dreadfully funny but she's amusing and I like that because it lightens it up a bit." ...|$|E

Professor Wilson, <b>I</b> think, <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that 'Beppo' was his best poem; because all his faults were there brought to a height. I never read the 'English Bards' through. His critical prognostications have, for the most part, proved erroneous.|$|R
2500|$|With such serious Allied fighter opposition, the Luftwaffe was {{put under}} severe {{pressure}} in March–April 1944. According {{to a report}} made by Adolf Galland, General der Jagdflieger, on 27 April 1944, 500 aircraft and 400 pilots had {{been lost in the}} 10 previous operations. Galland also said that in the previous four months 1,000 pilots had been killed. Galland reported that the enemy outnumbered his fighters between 6:1 and 8:1 and the standard of Allied fighter pilot training was [...] "astonishingly high". Galland recognised the Luftwaffe was losing the attrition war and pushed for a focus on quality rather than quantity. Galland stated in his 27 April report, [...] "I would at this moment rather have one Me 262 in action than five Bf 109s. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> three 109s, but the situation develops and changes." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{signing a}} five-year {{contract}} with producer Al Woods, Colbert played ingenue roles on Broadway from 1925 through 1929. During this period she disliked being typecast as a French maid. Colbert later said, [...] "In the very beginning, they wanted to give me French roles … That’s why <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> my name Col-bert {{just as it is}} spelled instead of Col-baire. I {{did not want to be}} typed as ‘that French girl.’" [...] She received critical acclaim on Broadway in the production of The Barker (1927) as a carnival snake charmer. She reprised this role for the play's run in London's West End. Colbert was noticed by the theatrical producer Leland Hayward, who suggested her for the heroine role in For the Love of Mike (1927), a silent film now believed to be lost. The film didn't fare well enough at the box-office.|$|E

Go into the library--I mean, if you please.--(Excuse my tone of command; <b>I</b> am <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'Do this,' and it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new inmate.)--Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave the door open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune." ...|$|R
5|$|She's so soft. She's {{beautiful}} too. I {{always tell}} her this story: When I {{was locked up}} in jail, that song 'Vision of Love' was the hottest song in the world. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> always <b>say,</b> 'Man, if I could meet her!' So I worked with her, then Pharrell hooked it up for me {{to work with her}} again this time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Didn't I {{always say}} it, sir," [...] he chuckled. [...] "Wasn't I right? <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to myself it 'ud {{be a pretty}} good school team that 'ud leave you out." ...|$|E

"Ah! many's the time, miss," [...] Jane {{said with}} a sigh, looking over at the empty grate, [...] "you'd come down here to make cakes or puddings, and laugh and joke like a child with Mary an' me. <b>I</b> often <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> Emily--her as was cook here before Ellen Smith,--'Miss Una's never so happy as when she's {{down here in the}} kitchen.'

40|$|<b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that in science, one cannot {{say what}} is right, {{but one can}} say what is wrong. And a model is, by definition, wrong, {{otherwise}} {{it is not a}} model, it is the truth. Being aware that a model aims to mimic the truth but will never be the truth, the only worth questions asking to a model are: (1) How wrong are we? And (2) Why are we wrong? The latter questions the foundations of the model, and is mainly the concerns of A. J. (Tom) van Loon's comments (2015, this issue). The first questions the accuracy of the outcomes, and corresponds more to G. Shanmugam's comments (2015, this issue). I am glad that our paper has aroused so rapidly as much feedbacks and comments, sometimes even before the manuscript is definitely published. We hope this paper will keep on inspiring various axes of research and opening new avenues in geosciences. Detailed answers to the comments raised by A. J. (Tom) van Loon and G. Shanmugam among others would certainly deserve a book, so my reply will just focus herein around the two aforementioned questions...|$|R

'To be sure, {{you must}} have a woollen dress, because it's the law, you know; but that need hinder no one from putting linen underneath. <b>I</b> always <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "If Sir John died tomorrow, I would bury him in his shirt;" [...] and I did.

"Ah, Mrs. Roberts, that is {{just what}} <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> of Samuel, {{but he was the}} biggest brute in the three kingdoms, for all that; but if you ask me, meaning no offence, I call a man a brute as only comes to see his lawful wife about twice a month, let alone making an angel cry." ...|$|E

My words carried weight, Mrs Trotman, in this quarter, as they naturally should, coming from a man of my experience,--especially when I gave tick. Every man I chalked up was of the same opinion as the landlord of the Cat and Fiddle, and always thought that Mowbray would rally. That's the killing feature of these times, Mrs Trotman, there's no rallying in the place." ...|$|R
