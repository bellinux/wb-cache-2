40|$|This MA thesis {{deals with}} the cost of {{photovoltaics}} subsidies in selected European countries. It consists of theoretical and applied sections. The theoretical one provides a brief history of photovoltaic technology and gives a short account of the attitude of European Union towards its support. In the applied part the promotion schemes used in Slovak Republic, Greece and the United Kingdom are described and the total costs of these schemes are estimated based on the best available predictions of future development. The total costs are then computed by adding the support promised. The total costs are estimated to amount to 3, 5 <b>bn</b> <b>EUR</b> <b>in</b> Slovakia, 16 <b>bn.</b> <b>EUR</b> <b>in</b> Greece and 13 <b>bn.</b> <b>EUR</b> <b>in</b> the UK...|$|R

30|$|A {{participation}} rate of approximately 50 % was achieved, with 28 retailers {{taking part in}} total. These included 14 retailers from fashion, two from consumer electronics, five from the DIY sector, and seven other retailers (e.g., specialized retailers, department stores). The participating retailers have their headquarters in a German-speaking country and operate in 21 countries on average. The retailers’ total annual sales average <b>EUR</b> 5.9 <b>bn,</b> with a maximum of more than <b>EUR</b> 40 <b>bn</b> and a minimum of <b>EUR</b> 200 m. <b>In</b> Germany, participants’ sales represent about 40 % of total sales in the OC fashion market, about 60 % in OC consumer electronics and almost the entire market for DIYs. The companies interviewed have been active in OC retailing—including operating an online shop—for between one and more than ten years.|$|R

30|$|In {{addition}} to the case study (see Sect.  6) alternative scenarios were prepared in order to evaluate {{the stability of the}} solution. In particular, the consequences of considering different discounting rates, uncertain demand as well as additional sustainability requirements are analyzed. Except the subject of analysis, the test instances of the scenarios are based on the same parameters as in the case study. Moreover, the same high-performance software and hardware with the same settings were used for the computations. As a result, the computation time (CT in seconds), the cash flows to/from the investor during his 3 -year engagement (FTE 0, FTE 1, FTE 2 and FTE 3 <b>in</b> <b>EUR</b> million), the expected annual cash outflow after his engagement determining the residual value (FTE 4 <b>in</b> <b>EUR</b> million), the present value of equity (VEQ <b>in</b> <b>EUR</b> million) and the overall percentage of demand coverage (COV in %) were recorded.|$|R
40|$|Upon {{accession}} to the European Union, the New Member State’s budget undergoes significant structural changes {{due to the}} appearance of new categories of revenues and expenditures. The aim {{of this paper is}} to estimate the possible effects of Croatian membership in the EU on changes in the structure and size of budget revenues and expenditures upon the country’s {{accession to}} the EU in the second half of 2013, as well as to indicate the possibilities for utilization of EU funds in the new financial perspective up to 2020. It is shown that in 2013 Croatia might realize a positive net financial position in transactions with the EU budget in the amount of approximately 0. 28 % of GDP, i. e. EUR 136 m. The total net financial position of Croatia due to EU accession, which includes some additional costs and benefits like different harmonization and the need for project co-financing at state and local levels, is also positive in 2013 and amounts to approximately 0. 15 % of GDP or equivalently EUR 72 m. Total amount of all funds that Croatia might receive in the new EU financial perspective covering the period from 2014 to 2020 amounts to <b>EUR</b> 6. 34 <b>bn,</b> whereby annual amounts increase from <b>EUR</b> 0. 7 <b>bn</b> <b>in</b> 2014 up to <b>EUR</b> 1. 2 <b>bn</b> <b>in</b> 2020. By using exponential regression analysis it is estimated that in 2020 Croatia should be a net recipient of funds from the EU budget in total amount of 1. 72 % of GDP, i. e. <b>EUR</b> 1. 13 <b>bn...</b>|$|R
