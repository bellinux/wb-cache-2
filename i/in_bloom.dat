30|$|Grubisic (2012); Grubisic et al. (2013), Cubric and Tosic (2017) defined several {{question}} stem templates to auto-generate questions {{aimed to}} assess students’ cognition {{at different levels}} <b>in</b> <b>Bloom’s</b> taxonomy. However, they never investigated whether the question stem templates order the auto-generated questions according to their easiness <b>in</b> <b>Bloom’s</b> taxonomy or whether the question stem templates affect the questions’ discrimination. Therefore, this section investigates {{the effect of the}} level of question <b>in</b> <b>Bloom’s</b> taxonomy on the question difficulty and discrimination.|$|R

5|$|As {{with many}} English gardens, {{this one is}} at its best in May and June, when the magnolias are <b>in</b> <b>bloom</b> and luxurious plants, such as peonies and alliums, are flowering. An ongoing {{initiative}} is being made to put in plants which provide interest throughout the season or are at their best in the late summer. There are now many species and colours of lavender and plenty of agapanthus, crinum, nerines and day lilies, together with such rarities as a Heptacodium and an Arbutus menziesii.|$|E
5|$|The City Council has {{responsibility}} for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) {{to cover the}} council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. They also evaluate local planning applications {{and work with the}} local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. This includes city centre management including CCTV, an alcohol ban and regulating street trading permissions including the two funfairs held in the Market Place in May and November each year and the Wells <b>In</b> <b>Bloom</b> competition. The city council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of city facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. They are involved in the management of the Community Sports Development Centre at the Blue School, the skateboard park and allotments in the grounds of the Bishop's Palace, Burcott Road and Barnes Close. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} mathematics teachers’ interpretation of higher-order thinking <b>in</b> <b>Bloom’s</b> Taxonomy. Thirty-two high school mathematics teachers from the southeast U.

Results indicate that mathematics teachers have difficulty interpreting the thinking skills <b>in</b> <b>Bloom’s</b> Taxonomy and creating test items for higher-order thinking. Alternatives to using Bloom’s Taxonomy to help mathematics teachers assess for higher-order thinking are discussed...|$|R

5|$|While {{he was in}} Paris at the Jardin des Plantes, Gray saw {{an unnamed}} dried specimen, {{collected}} by André Michaux, and named it Shortia galacifolia. He spent considerable time and effort over the next 38 years looking for a specimen in the wild. The first such expedition was in late June to late July 1841 to an area near Jefferson, Ashe County, North Carolina. His further expeditions searching for this species were also unsuccessful, including one in 1876. In May 1877 a North Carolina herb collector found a specimen but {{did not know what}} it was. Eighteen months later the collector sent it to Joseph Whipple Congdon, who contacted Gray, telling Gray that he felt he had found Shortia. Gray was ecstatic to confirm this when he saw the specimen in October 1878. In spring 1879 Gray led an expedition, in which the collector helped, to the spot where S.galacifolia had been found. Gray never saw the species in the wild <b>in</b> <b>bloom,</b> but made a final trip to this region in 1884.|$|E
