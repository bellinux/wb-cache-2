5000|$|When {{a nuclear}} reactor has been shut down, and nuclear fission is not {{occurring}} at a large scale, {{the major source of}} heat production will be due to the delayed beta decay of these fission products (which originated as fission fragments). For this reason, at the moment of reactor shutdown, decay heat will be about 6.5% of the previous core power if the reactor has had a long and steady power history. About 1 hour after shutdown, the decay heat will be about 1.5% of the previous core power. After a day, the decay heat falls to 0.4%, and after a week it will be only 0.2%. The decay heat production rate will continue to slowly decrease over time; the decay curve depends upon the proportions of the various fission products in the core and upon their respective half-lives. [...] An approximation for the decay heat curve valid from 10 seconds to 100 days after shutdown iswhere [...] is the <b>decay</b> <b>power,</b> [...] is the reactor power before shutdown, [...] is the time since reactor startup and [...] is the time of reactor shutdown mesured from the time of startup (in seconds). [...] For an approach with a more direct physical basis, some models use the fundamental concept of radioactive decay. Used nuclear fuel contains a large number of different isotopes that contribute to decay heat, which are all subject to the radioactive decay law, so some models consider decay heat to be a sum of exponential functions with different decay constants and initial contribution to the heat rate. [...] A more accurate model would consider the effects of precursors, since many isotopes follow several steps in their radioactive decay chain, and the decay of daughter products will have a greater effect longer after shutdown.|$|E

40|$|To {{support the}} safety {{analyses}} {{required for the}} conversion of the Belgian Reactor 2 (BR 2) from highly-enriched uranium (HEU) to low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel, the simulation of a number of loss-of-flow tests, with or without loss of pressure, has been undertaken. These tests were performed at BR 2 in 1963 and used instrumented fuel assemblies (FAs) with thermocouples (TC) imbedded in the cladding as well as probes to measure the FAs power {{on the basis of their}} coolant temperature rise. The availability of experimental data for these tests offers an opportunity to better establish the credibility of the RELAP 5 - 3 D model and methodology used in the conversion analysis. In order to support the HEU to LEU conversion safety analyses of the BR 2 reactor, RELAP simulations of a number of loss-of-flow/loss-of-pressure tests have been undertaken. Preliminary analyses showed that the conservative power distributions used historically in the BR 2 RELAP model resulted in a significant overestimation of the peak cladding temperature during the transient. Therefore, it was concluded that better estimates of the steady-state and <b>decay</b> <b>power</b> distributions were needed to accurately predict the cladding temperatures measured during the tests and establish the credibility of the RELAP model and methodology.
