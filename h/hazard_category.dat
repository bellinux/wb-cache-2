40|$|Fuel {{load and}} {{structure}} are fundamental drivers of fire behaviour. Accurate data {{is required for}} managers and researchers to better understand our ability to alter fire risk. While {{there are many ways}} to quantify fuel, visual assessment methods are generally considered the most efficient. Visual hazard assessments are commonly used by managers, government agencies and consultants to provide a fuel hazard score or rating but not a quantity of fuel. Many systems attempt to convert the hazard score or rating to a fuel load for use in fire behaviour models. Here we investigate whether the conversion table in the widely used Overall Fuel Hazard Guide (OFHG) matches destructively sampled fuel loads from 116 sites across five forest types. We specifically examine whether there are quantifiable differences that can be attributed to forest type. We found there is overlap between the two methods for low, moderate and high <b>hazard</b> <b>categories,</b> however for the very high and extreme <b>hazard</b> <b>categories,</b> visual assessment overestimated fuel load in four of the five forest types. Using a commonly applied fire behaviour model, we found that the overestimation of fuel load in very high and extreme <b>hazard</b> <b>categories</b> leads to an overestimation of fire behavior in these <b>hazard</b> <b>categories...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Specific {{target organ}} {{toxicity}} (STOT) [...] category distinguishes between single and repeated exposure for Target Organ Effects. All significant health effects, not otherwise specifically {{included in the}} GHS, that can impair function, both reversible and irreversible, immediate and/or delayed {{are included in the}} non-lethal target organ/systemic toxicity class (TOST). Narcotic effects and respiratory tract irritation are considered to be target organ systemic effects following a single exposure. Substances and mixtures of the single exposure target organ toxicity hazard class are assigned to one of three <b>hazard</b> <b>categories.</b> Substances and mixtures of the repeated exposure target organ toxicity hazard class are assigned to one of two <b>hazard</b> <b>categories.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Signal words: [...] "Danger" [...] or [...] "Warning" [...] {{will be used}} to {{emphasize}} hazards and indicate the relative level of severity of the hazard, assigned to a GHS <b>hazard</b> class and <b>category.</b> Some lower level <b>hazard</b> <b>categories</b> do not use signal words.

5000|$|Eye {{irritation}} means {{changes in}} the eye following {{the application of a}} test substance to the front surface of the eye, which are fully reversible within 21 days of application. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to a single harmonized <b>hazard</b> <b>category.</b> For authorities, such as pesticide regulators, wanting more than one designation for eye irritation, one of two subcategories can be selected, depending on whether the effects are reversible in 21 or 7 days.|$|E
5000|$|Carcinogenicity means a {{chemical}} substance or {{a mixture of}} chemical substances that induce cancer or increase its incidence. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are {{assigned to one of}} two <b>hazard</b> <b>categories.</b> Category 1 has two subcategories.|$|R

5000|$|Gases are {{category}} 1 flammable if {{they start}} to flame in a range in air at 20 °C and a standard pressure of 101.3 kPa. Category 2 is Non flammable and non toxic gases, and category 3 is toxic gases. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are {{assigned to one of}} two <b>hazard</b> <b>categories</b> {{on the basis of the}} outcome of the test or calculation method.|$|R
5000|$|Substances {{corrosive}} to metal are substances or mixtures that by chemical {{action will}} materially damage or even destroy metals.

The GHS criteria are a corrosion rate on steel or aluminum surfaces exceeding 6.25 mm per year at a test temperature of 55 °C.|$|E
5000|$|A {{flammable}} liquid is a liquid with a flash point of {{not more than}} 93 °C. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are {{assigned to one of}} four hazard categories {{on the basis of the}} flash point and boiling point. A pyrophoric liquid is a liquid that, even in small quantities, is liable to ignite within five minutes after coming into contact with air. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to a single <b>hazard</b> <b>category</b> on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.3.|$|E
50|$|Selection of {{appropriate}} PPE, given a certain task to be performed, is normally handled {{in one of}} two possible ways. The first method is to consult a <b>hazard</b> <b>category</b> classification table, like that found in NFPA 70E Table 130.7(C)(15)(a) lists a number of typical electrical tasks by various voltage levels and recommends the category of PPE that should be worn. For example, when working on 600 V switchgear and performing a removal of bolted covers to expose bare, energized parts, the table recommends a Category 3 Protective Clothing System. This Category 3 system corresponds to an ensemble of PPE that together offers protection up to 25 cal/cm² (105 J/cm² or 1.05 MJ/m²). The minimum rating of PPE necessary for any category is the maximum available energy for that category. For example, a Category 3 arc-flash hazard requires PPE rated for no less than 25 cal/cm² (1.05 MJ/m²).|$|E
5000|$|Aspiration hazard {{includes}} severe acute effects such as chemical pneumonia, {{varying degrees}} of pulmonary injury or death following aspiration. Aspiration is the entry of a liquid or solid directly through the oral or nasal cavity, or indirectly from vomiting, into the trachea and lower respiratory system. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are {{assigned to one of}} two <b>hazard</b> <b>categories</b> this <b>hazard</b> class on the basis of viscosity.|$|R
5000|$|Reproductive {{toxicity}} includes {{adverse effects}} on sexual function and fertility in adult males and females, as well as developmental toxicity in offspring. Substances and mixtures with reproductive and/or developmental effects are {{assigned to one of}} two <b>hazard</b> <b>categories,</b> 'known or presumed' and 'suspected'. Category 1 has two subcategories for reproductive and developmental effects. Materials which cause concern for the health of breastfed children have a separate category: effects on or via Lactation.|$|R
40|$|This Basis for Interim Operation (BIO) was {{developed}} for the PUREX end state condition following completion of the deactivation project. The deactivation project has removed or stabilized the hazardous materials within the facility structure and equipment to reduce the hazards posed by the facility during the surveillance and maintenance (S and M) period, and to reduce {{the costs associated with}} the S and M. This document serves as the authorization basis for the PUREX facility, excluding the storage tunnels, railroad cut, and associated tracks, for the deactivated end state condition during the S and M period. The storage tunnels, and associated systems and areas, are addressed in WHC-SD-HS-SAR- 001, Rev. 1, PUREX Final Safety Analysis Report. During S and M, the mission of the facility is to maintain the conditions and equipment in a manner that ensures the safety of the workers, environment, and the public. The S and M phase will continue until the final decontamination and decommissioning (D and D) project and activities are begun. Based on the methodology of DOE-STD- 1027 - 92, Hazards Categorization and Accident Analysis Techniques for Compliance with DOE Order 5480. 23, Nuclear Safety Analysis Reports, the final facility <b>hazards</b> <b>category</b> is identified as <b>hazards</b> <b>category</b> This considers the remaining material inventories, form and distribution of the material, and the energies present to initiate events of concern. Given the current facility configuration, conditions, and authorized S and M activities, there are no operational events identified resulting in significant hazard to any of the target receptor groups (e. g., workers, public, environment). The only accident scenarios identified with consequences to the onsite co-located workers were based on external natural phenomena, specifically an earthquake. The dose consequences of these events are within the current risk evaluation guidelines and are consistent with the expectations for a <b>hazards</b> <b>category</b> 2 facility...|$|R
50|$|Automatic {{check valves}} are {{required}} to prevent back pressure. Regulations for these check valves specify the design capabilities of the valve used, according to the <b>hazard.</b> <b>Category</b> 2 contamination may be prevented by a single check valve, but category 3 requires a double check valve (these are manufactured as a convenient single unit, or even integrated into tap (faucet) fittings). Category 5 requires an air gap, not merely a valve. A recent introduction to the UK has been the Reduced Pressure Zone (RPZ) valve, a form of double check valve where the intervening zone is drained and normally kept empty. If the downstream valve leaks and permits backflow, this will drain out through the vent rather than building up pressure against the upstream valve. These valves are complex, requiring certified installation and annual checks. They are used for category 4 systems, such as fire sprinklers where the system has an antifreeze additive.|$|E
50|$|Meadow Grounds Lake was {{completed}} in 1965 and is a 204-acre reservoir located within State Game Lands 53 in Fulton County, Pennsylvania. The dam and lake areas are leased to the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission (PFBC) by the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The dam was designed and built by the PFBC and construction of the dam was complete in June 1964. As the permit holder for the Meadow Grounds Dam the PFBC is responsible for its safe operation and maintenance. Meadow Grounds Dam is categorized by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) as a High <b>Hazard</b> (<b>Category</b> 1), size class B structure. The drainage area of the dam’s watershed is 3.2 square miles on Roaring Run. The zoned earth embankment creates a 204-acre reservoir and at normal pool stores 3130 (acre-feet) of water. A normal pool elevation of 1495.3’ is maintained throughout the year via the principal and auxiliary spillways. The zoned earth fill dam is 39 feet in height and 530 feet long. The auxiliary spillway at Meadow Grounds Dam is a trapezoidal-shaped concrete chute cut into rock though a natural saddle about 200 feet {{to the right of}} the dams right abutment. The spillway is provided with a 67 foot long trapezoidal-shaped weir that discharges into a concrete lined stilling basin and then into a riprap lined earth channel.|$|E
5000|$|A {{flammable}} solid {{is one that}} is readily combustible or may cause or contribute to fire through friction. Readily combustible solids are powdered, granular, or pasty substances which are dangerous if they can be easily ignited by brief contact with an ignition source, such as a burning match, and if the flame spreads rapidly. it is further divided into • {{flammable solid}}s, • polymerizing substances and • self-reactive substances, i.e., thermally unstable solids liable to undergo a strongly exothermic thermal decomposition even without participation of oxygen (air) other than materials classified as explosive, organic peroxides or as oxidizing.Spontaneously combusting solids or pyrophoric solids are solids that, even in small quantities, are liable to ignite within five minutes after coming into contact with air. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to a single <b>hazard</b> <b>category</b> {{on the basis of the}} outcome of the UN Test N.2. Self-heating substances are solids or liquids, other than a pyrophoric substance, which, by reaction with air and without energy supply, are liable to self-heat. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.4. Substances which on contact with water emit flammable gases are liable to become spontaneously flammable or to give off flammable gases in dangerous quantities. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of three hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of UN Test N.5, which measures gas evolution and speed of evolution. Flammable aerosols can be classified as Class 1 or Class 2 if they contain any component, which is classified as flammable.|$|E
40|$|Acute poisonings from {{chemicals}} and products {{continue to be}} a significant public health problem. Development of the Up-and-Down Procedure for acute oral systemic toxicity testing has reduced the number of animals used by 70 % while continuing to provide accurate classification and labeling for human health hazards. U. S. regulatory agencies also require acute dermal systemic toxicity testing for {{chemicals and}} products to estimate their potential to cause life-threatening or fatal toxicity from skin exposures. The resulting estimated lethal dose (LD 50) values are used for acute dermal exposure hazard classification and labeling in order to protect {{human health and the environment}} during the handling, transport, and use of chemicals. With the objective of reducing the number of animals used for acute dermal systemic toxicity testing while maintaining the protection of human health for acute dermal exposures, NICEATM analyzed acute oral systemic toxicity data to determine its usefulness for assigning acute dermal systemic toxicity <b>hazard</b> <b>categories</b> for a wide range of chemicals. LD 50 values were collected for 427 substances that had both acute oral and dermal data. Using oral data to classify dermal toxicity <b>hazard</b> <b>categories</b> underclassified 30 % (126 / 427) and overclassified 34 % (146 / 427) of the substances using the <b>hazard</b> classification <b>categories</b> in the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals. Underclassification of substances is less protective of public health and would fail to appropriately notify material handlers of chemical hazards while overclassification could desensitize them to such hazards. Therefore, acute oral toxicity data should not be used for classifying dermal toxicity hazards because it would underclassify or overclassify a substantial proportion of substances...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office has {{responsibility}} for environmental restoration at the Nevada National Security Site (formerly the Nevada Test Site). This includes remediation at locations where past testing activities {{have resulted in}} the release of plutonium to the environment. One of the current remediation efforts involves a site where an underground subcritical nuclear safety test was conducted in 1964. The underground test was vented through a steel pipe to the surface in a closed system where gas samples were obtained. The piping downstream of the gas-sampling apparatus was routed belowground to a location where it was allowed to vent into an existing radioactively contaminated borehole. The length of the pipe above the ground surface is approximately 200 meters. This pipe remained in place until remediation efforts began in 2007, at which time internal plutonium contamination was discovered. Following this discovery, an assessment was conducted to determine the quantity of plutonium present in the pipe. This site has been identified as Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 547, Miscellaneous Contaminated Waste Sites. The quantity of plutonium identified at CAU 547 exceeded the <b>Hazard</b> <b>Category</b> 3 threshold but was below the <b>Hazard</b> <b>Category</b> 2 threshold specified in DOE Standard DOE-STD- 1027 - 92. This CAU, therefore, was initially categorized as a <b>Hazard</b> <b>Category</b> 3 environmental restoration site. A contaminated facility or site that is initially categorized as <b>Hazard</b> <b>Category</b> 3, however, may be downgraded to below <b>Hazard</b> <b>Category</b> 3 if it can be demonstrated through further analysis that the form of the material and the energy available for release support reducing the <b>hazard</b> <b>category.</b> This is an important consideration when performing hazard categorization of environmental restoration sites because energy sources available for release of material are generally fewer at an environmental restoration site than at an operating facility and environmental restoration activities may result in the complete removal of source material...|$|E
