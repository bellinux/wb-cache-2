50|$|A {{data service}} unit, {{sometimes}} called a <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> <b>unit,</b> {{is a piece}} of telecommunications circuit terminating equipment that transforms digital data between telephone company lines and local equipment. The device converts bipolar digital signals coming ultimately from a digital circuit and directly from a Channel service unit (CSU), into a format (e.g. RS- 530) compatible with the piece of data terminal equipment (DTE) (e.g. a router) to which the data is sent. The DSU also performs a similar process in reverse for data heading from the DTE toward the circuit. The telecommunications service a DSU supports can be a point-to-point or multipoint operation in a digital data network.|$|E

Because its six tones are used only in pairs, this signaling format is sometimes referred to as [...] "two-out-of-five code" [...] or [...] "two of six."Multi-Frequency receivers have been present in US telephony at least since the late 1940s. In 1940s technology, receivers in 4XB and similar equipment used vacuum tubes. Later ones used RC filters and transistors.

40|$|Preparing academically rich {{collections}} {{for access}} by scholars and students is challenging, costly, and time consuming. Concerns for maintenance, preservation, and access are paramount. Typical of 20 th century archival collections, one {{is likely to}} encounter deteriorating and brittle documents, photographic prints and negatives, and obsolete formats such as open reel audio tapes, audio cassettes, and video tapes. More recent collections may also contain computer media; the proliferation of formats and media types impacts {{the complexity of the}} work in providing access, as well as the costs. Without sizeable resources, it would take years to process these collections fully, especially those rich with audio and visual materials. Taking all of this into consideration, the Archives Research Center (ARC) and <b>Digital</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Unit</b> (DSU) of the AUC Woodruff Library decided to investigate options for grant funding to expedite the processing and digitization of these underutilized archival collections.

40|$|Around 2007, the Atlanta University Center Robert W. Woodruff Library (AUC Woodruff Library) began {{advancing}} {{the goals of}} the then-Archives 2 ̆ 6 Special Collections Department to increase access to primary resources and archival materials. Built upon a rich physical collection, the digital collections provided remote researchers with the opportunity to research holdings, request images for exhibition and publication, and incorporate materials into curriculum and scholarship. In 2006 and 2010, the AUC Woodruff Library began serving as custodian for the Morehouse College Martin Luther King Jr. (MCMLK) and the Tupac Amaru Shakur (TAS) Collections, respectively. Along with the fame associated with these high-profile collections came the need for increased security. The vast majority of the MCMLK Collection is digitized, as are the writings by Shakur and some of his group-mates. However, the agreements require MCMLK and TAS Collection to be made accessible only in the reading room of the Library. In stark contrast to these two notable collections, the AUC Woodruff Library has been successful in creating digital collections open broadly and widely to anyone in the world with an internet connection. The Library’s digital collections consist of audio and visual recordings, theses and dissertations, photographs and documents. Additionally, the Library was recently awarded a National Endowment for Humanities grant to expand access to collections on African American religion – most of which will have some digitized elements.

40|$|Tuwhera (‘be open’) is AUT’s Open Access journal {{publishing}} platform. It officially {{launched in}} October 2016. The project to create Tuwhera {{was based on}} a feasibility study carried out by senior staff at AUT Library in 2014. That report explored the possibilities of developing an open access scholarly journal publishing service {{to meet the needs of}} academics within the university seeking new ways to make their journals more visible and accessible. A number of proprietorial and open sources hosting solutions were investigated with the Library selecting Open Journal Systems as the product on which to build the platform. The Library successfully bid for AUT Capex funding for the project and work began in February 2016. The project was led by the Library’s Scholarly Communications team, established as an outcome of an organisational review of its <b>Digital</b> <b>Services</b> <b>unit</b> and in recognition of an emerging and significant area for academic libraries. The project team connected with key stakeholders across the university, including ICT, the Research and Innovation Office and a wide range of academic staff. The name, Tuwhera, emerged early on in the project, giving the service not only a point of difference but an identity which acknowledges AUT’s commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi. The name was chosen in consultation with Māori representatives within the University and when the platform was officially launched, the event was marked by appropriate tikanga. If Tuwhera’s initial aim was simple, then its vision has evolved to be much more expansive. The principles and values underpinning Tuwhera have inspired a great deal of interest within the University and have opened up numerous possibilities for scholarly communications at AUT. In realising those possibilities, Tuwhera is positioning itself as a key player in driving the Open Access movement and influencing the research culture in Aotearoa New Zealand...|$|R
40|$|Interest {{in digital}} {{scholarship}} has steadily increased at NYU {{over the past}} four years, with scholars looking to the Libraries for information, support, and partnership. During this time, the Libraries have taken an iterative, learn-as-we-go approach while simultaneously conducting in-depth research into user needs and service gaps. This resulted in a four-tiered service model which, in Fall 2013, was officially put into practice with the formation of the Libraries’ <b>Digital</b> Scholarship <b>Services</b> <b>unit.</b> When we introduced the four-tiered service model at DLF, November 2011, we predicted that a key function of our unit would be to prioritize which projects get what type of service (standard, customized, etc.). What we didn’t anticipate was the extent to which we would become the nosey switchboard operators of our own organization, listening in on library departmental conversations about their service frustrations, and plugging them into complementary departments or initiatives to address these challenges systemically. These insights are helping us strategically rethink relationships, workflows, and protocols that undergird the organization’s work. To date, the departments most frequently connecting via this developing “party line” are special collections, subject specialists, Data <b>Services,</b> <b>Digital</b> Studio, and <b>Digital</b> Library Technology <b>Services.</b> We will present case studies to illustrate how scholars’ project needs are revealing ways we can integrate diverse services across Libraries and IT, and how this vantage point provides a unique opportunity to address longstanding organizational issues. We will engage the audience through discussion to learn how other institutions approach similar issues providing <b>digital</b> scholarship <b>services...</b>|$|R
40|$|For {{the past}} several years, many {{libraries}} have been developing institutional repositories to house their open access publishing efforts to both showcase and preserve their faculty’s research. Some of those same libraries have been building sizable digital collections, often built from digitized versions of materials in their special collections. So {{what happens when you}} put these two groups together? The University of South Florida Tampa Library did exactly that by creating a new <b>Digital</b> Scholarship <b>Services</b> <b>unit.</b> The union of these two groups has created new synergies between staff in complementary areas of the library, as we combine unique skill sets from each group to offer new services to the faculty. This presentation will discuss why this change was made, examine some of the benefits and growing pains of this change, and showcase some of the unusual projects that have resulted. For example, a group of faculty from the College of Education has a multimodal project featuring new methodological approaches for analyzing various formats such as websites, images, and film. The library also has two research associates who are archaeologists creating three dimensional representations of artifacts for cultural heritage preservation that are now embedded with metadata in the repository. Creating such collections not only highlights the university’s work but provides materials professors can use to enhance their course curricula and use technology to engage students in new and innovative ways...|$|R

We seek to demonstrate that consumer value for <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> business models may be quite different even when consumers have similar preferences for standard technology characteristics. In {{the context of this}} paper, we specifically consider consumer perceived value associated with Personal Health Records (PHRs) and PHR digital business models, through the use of an integrated latent variable and choice empirical model. We find that although consumer perceived value for PHRs is generally high, when offered a choice between three competing PHR business models, consumers state high value for only two of the business models in the choice set: PHRs offered directly by groups of medical providers and Integrated PHRs.
