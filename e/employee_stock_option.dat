40|$|In this paper, we {{show how}} <b>employee</b> <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> can be valued {{under the new}} {{reporting}} standards IFRS 2 and FASB 123 (revised) for share-based payments. Both standards require companies to expense <b>employee</b> <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> at fair value. We propose a new valuation model, referred to as Enhanced American model, that complies with the new standards and produces fair values often lower than those generated by traditional models such as the Black–Scholes model or the adjusted Black–Scholes model. We also provide a sensitivity analysis of model input parameters and analyze {{the impact of the}} parameters on the fair value of the option. The valuation of <b>employee</b> <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> requires an accurate estimation of the exercise behavior. We show how the exercise behavior can be modeled in a binomial tree and demonstrate the relevance of the input parameters in the calibration of the model to an estimated expected life of the option.
