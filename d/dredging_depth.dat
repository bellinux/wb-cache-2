40|$|Abstract. Baihua Lake {{is a key}} {{drinking}} water source for Guiyang City located on Guizhou Plateau in southwest China, however it has been seriously contaminated with various contaminants, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and heavy metals. To solve this problem, some researchers have recommended dredging the lake sediment to remove these contaminants. The present research was aimed to assess the potential risk of five selected heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Cr, Hg and As) if the sediment dredging measure was taken for remediation of this water body. Core sediments collected from the site Guanyinshanzhuang were used to simulate the release of heavy metals in sediment from Baihua Lake if sediment dredging was carried out. The core sediments were dredged at 10 cm, 20 cm and 30 cm levels. The core sediments were then put into the lake again after simulation dredging to investigate their release potential in one day, five days, nine days and fifteen days. The mobility of selected heavy metals in the sediments were determined using the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The {{results indicated that the}} release potential of the heavy metals varies with <b>dredging</b> <b>depth</b> and the lasting time after dredging. Cr and As showed the lowest release ability among the heavy metals under study followed by Cu. The release amount of Cd increased with the lasting tim...|$|E

40|$|Coastal lines, harbors/ports, and inland {{waterways}} constitute the marine transportation system, {{a major component}} of the United States freight system, carrying a vast majority of foreign imports and exports and a significant amount of domestic freight. This system needs regular maintenance. US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) {{is in charge of the}} waterway system maintenance. However, the limited maintenance budget needs to accommodate a large number of maintenance requests for dredging and dam repair, etc. The requests often exceed the budget available by much. A decision facing the USACE management is what projects to fund and how to select them. This research aims at providing the necessary models and tools to facilitate maintenance decisions at the USACE. The objective is to maximize the overall system improvement under annual limited budget. The underlying problem can be modeled as a knapsack problem with an additional constraint that increases the problem complexity. The additional constraints describe the benefit interdependency of different maintenance projects due to the waterways network effect. This research tackles the maintenance problem at different levels. First, an integer selection model is developed to find the optimal set of dredging projects (waterway sediment removal operation) and some heuristics are developed to provide near-optimal solutions in computationally guaranteed polynomial time. Next, a model is developed to allow partial dredging. Partial dredging means partially conducting the requested dredging operation. The model is able to determine the percentage of the <b>dredging</b> <b>depth</b> to fund instead of a zero-one dredging decision for each project. Further, a stochastic problem is considered regarding to the probabilistic shoaling process. To solve the probabilistic problem, two methods are designed: an analytical model that takes account of probability in terms of expected values, and a stochastic optimization approach was developed based on Monte-Carlo simulation. Finally, the problem is modeled in a multi-modal context where the maintenance decisions are made simultaneously on dredging and lock/dam improvement. In this multimodal model, the effect of landside modes? capacity is considered comprehensively. All the developed methods are tested with real examples from US marine network and their performance is approved by comparison to real situation...|$|E
40|$|The {{first issue}} {{involves}} {{the accessibility of}} the pier of the refinery where coastal tankers moor to load or unload their cargo. The current depth at the pier is too small for large coastal tankers to fully load when mooring at the pier. In order to increase their cargo capacity, the depth in the mooring area should be increased. To expand the present pier into deeper water would be too expensive. Another option is dredging. The stability of the pier, dolphins and gantry might be endangered by dredging activities, but since only 2 to 3 meters of soil need to be dredged, and because the gantry has a reach of 10 m., {{it is possible to}} design the dredging area far enough from the pier to not {{have an effect on the}} pier- and gantry stability. The dolphins are closer to the dredging area and need to be replaced. The new dolphin design is adjusted to the <b>dredging</b> <b>depth.</b> The new mooring area is only accessible for the largest mooring coastal tankers when fully loaded during several hours a day, because of the tides. Therefore they might have to wait in the mooring area for several hours if the pier is occupied. Smaller or unloaded tankers can reach the mooring area at any time. The second issue is about oil leakage from the refinery into the surrounding soil. On the area of the refinery of La Libertad petrochemical substances have been leaking into the subsoil. This has lead to the contamination of the soil around the refinery of La Libertad. Most of the pollution is found on the area of the refinery itself. However, on the ocean side of the refinery the contamination reaches out of the refinery's territory. A gasoline smell can be detected and petrochemical substances have been found in the subsoil of the beach. In this area there is a primary school, a military campus and a little village called La Carioca, that all suffer from this contamination. The source of the contamination of the beach area was a leaking pipe, upstream of the beach. This pipe has been traced and has been replaced by a new pipe. The contamination of the soil in this area causes risks for the human health and for the environment. To reduce the impact of the pollution in the contaminated area on the ocean side of the refinery of La Libertad different alternatives have been generated. Only methods have been used that involve groundwater or groundwater flow. The best way to reduce the impact of the contamination is to construct a slurry wall between the ocean and the contaminated plume. On the downstream side of the contaminated groundwater plume three extraction wells are located. The plume is entirely captured in the combined capture zone of these wells so the contamination can not spread any further. On the upstream side of the contaminated groundwater plume an injection well is located. This injection well makes sure that the plume can be removed more quickly. Additives can be put in the water that is injected through the injection well. This will cause more components of the oil mixture to dissolve in the water so more of the pollution can be removed from the soil.

40|$|The {{main focus}} of this {{research}} is determining when dredging of reservoirs is feasible. First the main issues associated with the sedimentation of reservoirs are investigated. Most important are the loss of reservoir volume, sediment shortages downstream of the dam and possible blockage of water intakes. The sedimentation issues occur mostly in sediment laden rivers. Reservoirs close to the origin of the river, for instance in mountainous terrain usually do not suffer from severe sedimentation issues. A survey is held under authorities responsible for different reservoirs. Results indicate that not all reservoirs suffer sedimentation issues, but part of the worldwide dams and reservoirs does. The most important conclusion is that sedimentation at this moment will only be dealt with if it is clearly affecting the function of a reservoir or if the function of a reservoir is threatened in the near future. The matter has to be urgent enough that owners are willing to spend funds on mitigating sedimentation issues. If added value can be gained through removing sediment this improves the business case of dredging. In the survey this is verified by the respondents. Methods of dealing with reservoir sediment are discussed. Different dredging methods for the dredging of reservoirs are presented and investigated. The main advantages of dredging are found to be precise removal of sediment, avoiding large sediment flushes and no excessive loss of water. Using a 1 -dimensional Sobek model, it is shown that part of the sediment entering the reservoir can be used for downstream river restoration. Different factors that influence the feasibility of dredging are identified. The function of the reservoir is important. For the functions of irrigation, storage of hydro power, water supply and flood control the available volume is for example important. Sediment control is therefore important. By modelling different shapes for reservoirs using Delft 3 D, it is found that the type of reservoir only partly determines the location of sediment in the reservoir. Other factors influencing the deposit location are sediment concentration and the type of sediment. The maximum reservoir depth is found to be linked to the dam height. To determine if the dredging of reservoirs is feasible it has to be clear that the reservoir function or intake is threatened by sediment. Based on the function of the reservoir a business case can be made comparing costs and benefits. Benefits of extra reservoir volume are estimated. Possible added values are taken into account, such as the possible sale of dredged material. A dredging model is created to estimate the costs of reservoir dredging. This model takes different parameters such as sediment composition, <b>dredging</b> <b>depth,</b> reservoir type and transport distance into account. Using this model for different scenarios it is shown that dredging prices can start as low as 1. 01 euro. If the sediment is made up of soft and loose material this reduces the price of dredging. Furthermore the transport distance of the dredged material to shore has a large influence on the dredging costs. The transport distance for the dredged material must be kept small and the volume of material dredged must be over 25, 000 $m^ 3 $ to find a stable price. For all reservoirs these parameters are different, leading to a reservoir specific dredging price estimate. Low dredging prices are possible under favourable conditions. At these prices, dredging can compete with other sediment management techniques. On top of that, the added benefits of dredging have to be taken into account: downstream river restoration, the possible sale of dredged sediment and increased downstream soil fertility. These benefits increase the feasibility of dredging a reservoir further. The dredging of certain reservoirs is seemingly beneficial. Reference reservoir dredging projects have to be performed to confirm that this Further research into the deposition of sediment in different types of reservoirs is recommended. Also more investigations into the downstream return of sediment are recommended...|$|E
