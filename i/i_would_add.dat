Many were sold to brokers by their parents. Some responded willingly to brokers' offers; others were deceived. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>add</b> that, on the average, living conditions in the comfort stations were practically identical to those in brothels set up for American troops during the Vietnam War.|$|E
500|$|Keynes was {{a proponent}} of eugenics. He served as {{director}} of the British Eugenics Society from 1937 to 1944. As late as 1946, shortly before his death, Keynes declared eugenics to be [...] "the most important, significant and, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>add,</b> genuine branch of sociology which exists." ...|$|E
500|$|Lightning Bar died in June 1960 from colitis-X, {{a disease}} of unknown origin that can kill rapidly and without warning. It {{infected}} many of Pollard's horses; of those affected only three survived. Heartbroken, Pollard sold his remaining stock and {{did not return to}} the Quarter Horse business for 15years. He said later that [...] "it was a nightmare when they were wiped out. Even now, we can still feel the sadness of losing those horses." [...] Another time, Pollard remarked that [...] "Someone once said that a man deserves one good woman and one good dog in his lifetime. To that quip <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>add</b> one good horse. I certainly had one in Lightning Bar." ...|$|E

40|$|This talk has {{two related}} aims. First of all, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to <b>add</b> Carl Gustav Hempel to the {{founding}} fathers of scientific philosophy, hereby creating at least a secular trinity of Carnap, Reichenbach and Hempel. Second, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to <b>add</b> “pragmatic ” considerations {{as an integral part}} of scientific philosophy, or, at least...|$|R
6000|$|Look at me. Consider {{the trouble}} I have been in. Is {{it likely that}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{wilfully}} <b>add</b> to my other self-reproaches, that of being ungrateful or treacherous to you. I do not understand you.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Marcel Duchamp {{began to}} view the {{manufactured}} objects of his collection as objects of art, which he called [...] "readymades". He would add signatures and titles to some, converting them into artwork that he called [...] "readymade aided" [...] or [...] "rectified readymades". Duchamp wrote: [...] "One important characteristic was the short sentence which I occasionally inscribed on the 'readymade.' That sentence, instead of describing the object like a title, was meant to carry {{the mind of the}} spectator towards other regions more verbal. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>add</b> a graphic detail of presentation which in order to satisfy my craving for alliterations, would be called 'readymade aided.'" [...] One such example of Duchamp's readymade works is the urinal that was turned onto its back, signed [...] "R. Mutt", titled [...] "Fountain", and submitted to the Society of Independent Artists exhibition that year, though it was not displayed.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>added</b> more, {{but there}} was {{something}} in his attitude that silenced me. He had turned half from me, and stood now, hand on hip, his great head thrown back and tilted towards his shoulder, his expression one of freezing and disdainful wonder.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What to do, you ask,' {{said the}} Rector; 'I {{am not sure}} that I know what you mean. If your neglect has added to her sufferings, you cannot remove them; and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>add</b> to your sorrow unless you wished me to do so for your good.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "All of this I will do, your Highness, if by {{any chance}} it lies in my power, though who am I that I should hope to make a path for the feet of kings?

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>added</b> the {{relative}} rain-fall to the above, {{but this is}} so very local a phenomenon, and my observations were so repeatedly deranged by having to camp in forests, and by local obstacles of all kinds, that I have suppressed them; their general results I have given in Appendix F.|$|R

And, on his monument, I would permit a long inscription, composed by his dearest friends, which should remain tax-free for ever.|$|E
60|$|My {{answer to}} that {{question}} would be an emphatic No. My answer would be that the idea of representative government is the only possible idea for the government of a civilised community. But <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>add</b> that so far representative government has not had even the beginnings of a fair trial. So far we have not had representative government, but only a devastating caricature.|$|E

"I admit," [...] I answered, {{although}} I {{was trembling}} {{so much that}} I could hardly speak with steadiness, [...] "that a woman may be splendid and lovely beyond anything that the mind of man can conceive, whatever her age, of which I know nothing. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>add</b> this, Ayesha, that I {{thank you very much}} for having revealed to me the glory that is hid beneath your veil." ...|$|E
6000|$|It is a {{good one}} in itself, would express the eldest sister's pursuit, and glanced at now and then in the text, would hold the reader in suspense. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> propose to <b>add</b> the line, ...|$|R

5000|$|Shelley Blond {{provided}} {{the voice of}} Lara Croft for the game. She recalled, [...] "I was asked to perform her voice in a very plain non-emotive manner and in a 'female Bond' type of way. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>added</b> more inflection, tone and emotion to my voice but they {{wanted to keep it}} how they felt it should sound, which was quite right.

60|$|Whilst, however, {{expressing a}} sincere and affectionate {{regard for the}} {{memories}} {{of those who have}} preceded me in religious professions, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>add</b> that I consider them worthy to be followed only as they followed Christ, and that if I go forth by the footsteps of this flock of my Saviour's companions, it is that I may feed beside that good Shepherd's tents, where, I believe, they found plentiful pasture.|$|E
60|$|I give it up. I hear of {{wonderful}} bargains in fabrics, and of miracles performed with needle and thread; but I am in doubt.

Twice she had been to Coney Island and had ridden the hobby-horses. 'Tis a weary thing to count your pleasures by summers instead of by hours.|$|E
60|$|The Sandwich Islands remain my {{ideal of}} the perfect thing {{in the matter of}} {{tropical}} islands. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>add</b> another story to Mauna Loa's 16,000 feet if I could, and make it particularly bold and steep and craggy and forbidding and snowy; and I would make the volcano spout its lava-floods out of its summit instead of its sides; but aside from these non-essentials I have no corrections to suggest. I hope these will be attended to; I do not wish to have to speak of it again.|$|E
5000|$|... {{too much}} of Free Trade Reimagined {{consists}} of assertions (rather than testable hypotheses), without even examples to illustrate them. To buttress his arguments, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> suggest <b>adding</b> many real world examples. It is indeed difficult to revolutionize a theory that {{has been around for}} many years and change radically a trading system built on it, by writing one book. It certainly can’t be done by simply imagining that an alternative system is superior.|$|R

I added a small moustache, which, <b>I</b> reasoned, <b>would</b> <b>add</b> age without hiding my expression. I {{had no idea of}} the character. But the moment I was dressed, the clothes and the makeup made me feel the person he was. I began to know him, and by the time I walked on stage he was fully born." ...|$|R
50|$|Following Arsaces' {{untimely}} death {{the next year}} in 36 BC, Antony appointed Polemon I as client king of Pontus. Years later, in 16 BC, Polemon I, {{at the request of}} Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and with the approval of Roman Emperor Augustus, married Queen Dynamis of the Bosporan Kingdom, becoming ruler of that realm in addition to Pontus and Cilicia. Polemone <b>I</b> <b>would</b> later <b>add</b> Colchis to his realm of client kingdoms he ruled on behalf of Rome.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{counsel is}} good," [...] said the Duke of Athens, turning his shrewd wizened {{face to the}} King; [...] "but one thing only <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>add</b> to it. The {{strength}} of these people lies in their archers, and if we could throw them into disorder, were it only for a short time, we should win the hedge; else they will shoot so strongly that we must lose many men before we reach it, for indeed {{we have learned that}} no armor will keep out their shafts when they are close." ...|$|E

Here we are, whether wisely or unwisely, and here we must remain--at least till there is a lull in the eruption. `God is our refuge.' He ought to be so at all times, but there are occasions when this great, and, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>add,</b> glorious fact is pressed upon our understandings with unusual power. Such a time is this. Come--we will see what His word says to us just now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>add</b> one word. You Easterns {{have two}} sayings which you teach to your children; {{that they should}} learn to shoot with the bow, and {{to tell the truth}}. O King, they are my last lessons to you. Learn to shoot with the bow--which you cannot do, and to tell the truth which you have not done.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} the difficulties facing any study of new technologies. In my approach to the study of the internet, I am faced with taking it to be, according to the opposition suggested by Hine (2000), either 'culture' or 'cultural artefact'. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> also <b>add</b> the further complicating distinction between 'emotion' and 'consumption'. I use the qualitative method of auto-ethnography - for Lewin, this variety of ethnography mixes fieldwork and literary expression as part and parcel of the same enterprise...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>added</b> {{somewhat}} to {{that which}} Pierre had said, counting thereby to soothe my cousin; but little Frenchie dragged me back, motioning with his finger on his lips that I hold my peace. I understood that again was the lad right, for if {{we did what we}} might toward coaxing Saul into a better humor, we were possibly giving him an opportunity to fly off in a rage again, {{and that would have been}} fatal to all the faint hopes in which we then indulged.|$|R
