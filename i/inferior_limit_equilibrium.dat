40|$|Abstract. Automobile body sheets mainly resist {{impact and}} pressure. However, the fatigue {{property}} {{is one of}} the main factors with regard to properties of sheet steels. Continuous vibration happens all over the sheet steels (especially chassis) while the vehicle is in motion. And the fatigue property becomes particularly important in the condition above. Fatigue tests are conducted to four kinds of thin sheet steels for automobile in this paper. The fatigue lives of samples from sheet steels are obtained according to the various stresses. The <b>inferior</b> <b>limits</b> of fatigue life and the <b>inferior</b> <b>limits</b> of fatigue strength under the higher stresses are acquired by the computation of fatigue data. Furthermore, the test results show that there is a certain relationship among the tensile strength, yielding strength and <b>inferior</b> <b>limit</b> of fatigue strength for these sheet steels.

50|$|In mathematics, the <b>limit</b> <b>inferior</b> and <b>limit</b> {{superior}} of {{a sequence}} {{can be thought}} of as limiting (i.e., eventual and extreme) bounds on the sequence. They {{can be thought of}} in a similar fashion for a function (see limit of a function). For a set, they are the infimum and supremum of the set's limit points, respectively. In general, when there are multiple objects around which a sequence, function, or set accumulates, the <b>inferior</b> and superior <b>limits</b> extract the smallest and largest of them; the type of object and the measure of size is context-dependent, but the notion of extreme limits is invariant. <b>Limit</b> <b>inferior</b> is also called infimum <b>limit,</b> liminf, <b>inferior</b> <b>limit,</b> lower limit, or inner limit; limit superior is also known as supremum limit, limit supremum, limsup, superior limit, upper limit, or outer limit.|$|R

40|$|The {{most common}} {{analysis}} methods on shallow foundation are Terzaghi, Meyerhof, and Vesic. All {{of them are}} based on <b>limit</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> when the foundation starting to failure by applying maximum load. One of disadvantages of this method is that deformation and displacement of foundation and soil are not being considered. This behavior {{is very important for}} determining ultimate bearing capacity. The subject of this research is to compare the bearing capacity of shallow foundation between <b>limit</b> <b>equilibrium</b> method and finite element method (FEM). The foundation is modeled as strip rigid footing, whereas soil media is cohessive material with Mohr-Coulomb material model. The variation of soil consistency are: very soft, soft, medium, stiff and very stiff. The result indicates that bearing capacity by using finite element approach is relatively different from <b>limit</b> <b>equilibrium</b> method. The first methods is larger than the last one.

40|$|Objective: There {{has been}} {{inconsistency}} about {{definition of the}} temporal stem despite of several descriptions demonstrating its microanatomy using fiber dissection and/or diffusion tensor tractography. This {{study was designed to}} clarify three dimensional configurations of the temporal stem. Methods: The fronto-temporal regions of several formalin-fixed human cerebral hemispheres were dissected under an operating microscope using the fiber dissection technique. The consecutive coronal cuts of the dissected specimens were made to define the relationships of white matter tracts comprising the temporal stem and the subcortical gray matters (thalamus, caudate nucleus, amygdala) with <b>inferior</b> <b>limiting</b> (circular) sulcus of insula. Results: The <b>inferior</b> <b>limiting</b> sulcus of insula, limen insulae, medial sylvian groove, and caudate nucleus/amygdala were more appropriate anatomical structures than the roof/dorso-lateral wall of the temporal horn and lateral geniculate body which were used to describe previously for delineating the temporal stem. The particular space located inside the line connecting the <b>inferior</b> <b>limiting</b> sulcus of insula, limen insulae, medial sylvian groove/amygdala, and tail of caudate nucleus could be documented. This space included the extreme capsule, uncinate fasciculus, inferior occipito-frontal fasciculus, anterior commissure, ansa peduncularis, and inferior thalamic peduncle including optic radiations, whereas the stria terminalis, cingulum, fimbria, and inferior longitudinal fiber of the temporal lobe were not passing through this space. Also, this continued posteriorly along the caudate nucleus and limiting sulcus of the insula.

40|$|During {{the spring}} of 2003, the {{downstream}} slope of an embankment dam began to move during an extreme flooding event. The current study was implemented to evaluate the slope stability of the embankment and as a case-study to compare the <b>limit</b> <b>equilibrium</b> and continuum modeling methods. Initially, stability analyses were performed using conservative shear strength of soils estimated from both boring log data and an infinite slope back analysis. The Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion was employed in the computer simulations. The computer program UTEXAS 4 and Spencer method of solution {{was used to evaluate}} the <b>limit</b> <b>equilibrium</b> factors of safety and the critical failure surface. The computer program FLAC 4. 0 was used to evaluate the stress/strain behavior of the slope and determine factors of safety using the strength reduction method. Both these <b>limit</b> <b>equilibrium</b> and continuum models yielded slip surfaces that were close in geometry and location to the actual slip surface observed in the field. The factor of safety for the pre-failure embankment geometry was lower utilizing the <b>limit</b> <b>equilibrium</b> approach than that estimated by the continuum approach; however, the continuum approach appeared to yield more accurate results when using the best estimate of the shear strength. Back-analyses performed based on the observed failure surface in the field after flooding event provided estimates of shear strength of the embankment soil. The back calculated shear strength utilizing the continuum model fell within acceptable ranges as determined from the boring log data, with the continuum model yielding the more conservative (lower) back calculated shear strength. Back calculated shear strength using the <b>limit</b> <b>equilibrium</b> method was higher and its use may result in unconservative designs...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{observation}} of 12 rock fall scars in steep limestone cliffs {{has shown that}} the fallen masses were stable as a result of relatively small rock bridges. These results demonstrate that consideration of rock bridges is necessary for a realistic evaluation of stability. <b>Limit</b> <b>equilibrium</b> methods of analysis are presented for sliding and toppling, for both isostatic and hyperstatic conditions. These methods are illustrated with four case histories. The results of nine back-analyses of rock falls with volumes between 24 and 3500 m 3 are presented. The rock cohesion obtained from back-analysis appears to be significantly lower than the cohesion obtained from classical laboratory tests. This discrepancy can be attributed to several factors including: a spatial and temporal scale effect, the oversimplified modelling (two-dimensional <b>limit</b> <b>equilibrium)</b> and some uncertainties affecting the geometrical data.

40|$|One of {{the basic}} types of {{strength}} calculations is the calculation of <b>limit</b> <b>equilibrium</b> of constructions. This report describes new method for solving the problem of <b>limit</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> The rigid-plastic system in this method is substituted with an «equivalent» elastic system with specially constructed rigidities. This {{is why it is}} called the method of pseudorigidities. An iteration algorithm was developed for finding pseudorigidities. This algorithm is realized in a special software procedure. Conjunction of this procedure with any elastic calculation program (base program) creates a program solving rigid-plastic problems. It is proved, that iterations will be converge to the solution for the problem of <b>limit</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> The solution of tests show, that pseudorigidity method is universal.
