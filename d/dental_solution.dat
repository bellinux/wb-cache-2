40|$|The {{treatment}} {{of patients with}} hypertension is increasingly common. Hypertensives are a problem because they exhibit a great lability of a blood pressure. The anticipation of dental treatment causes an initial elevation of the blood pressure which may be heightened by the stimulus of an injection or dental treatment. However, probably the underlying causes is endogenous adrenaline. Adrenaline is the most potent and efficient of vasoconstricting drug used in <b>dental</b> anesthetic <b>solution.</b> Lidocaine causes vasodilation, without adrenaline lidocaine is rapidly absorbed from the administration site. Vasoconstrictors are important additions to local anesthetic solutions. They {{improve the quality of}} pain control and its duration while decreasing the potential toxicity of the local anesthetic. Observation of dental clinic patients at Loma Linda University confirm the fact that the blood pressure is not elevated by the small amount of vasocontrictor (1 : 100, 000) contained in the most commonly employed <b>dental</b> anesthetic <b>solution.</b> All of the adrenergic amines can produce potentially dangerous cardiovascular effect and elicit disturbing subjactive response when high blood concentration are obtrained. For these reasons Felypressin a nonsymphatomimetic amine alternative for vasoconstriction has been used. An aspirating syringe should be used to avoid the risk of intra vascular injection when administering a local anesthetic solution and it is considered advisable to avoid adrenaline if the hypertension is not controlled...|$|R

This study aimed {{to assess the}} wear of the seating platforms of externally hexed titanium implants when connected to zirconia abutments comparing to titanium abutments, after thermocycling and mechanical loading (TCML). MethodsSix BNT® S 4 external connection implants (Phibo® <b>Dental</b> <b>Solutions,</b> Barcelona, Spain) were selected and {{divided into two groups}} (n= 3) : TiCE, screwed to titanium abutments and ZrCE, screwed to zirconia abutments. The samples underwent thermocycling (5000 cycles; 5 – 55 °C) and mechanical loading (1. 2 × 106 cycles; 88. 8 N; 4 Hz). Before and after TCML, the seating platforms of the implants were analyzed by 3 D profilometry in two areas to measure their topography based on the superficial analysis parameters (Sa and Sz) parameters, and were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Data were statistically analyzed by Mann–Whitney test (p 0. 05 and p= 0. 059). The abutment's material (titanium/zirconia) did not statistically significantly influence the Sa and Sz values after TCML (p= 0. 886 > 0. 05 and p= 0. 200, respectively). However, the SEM analysis reveals a mild wear in some vertices of the hex when connected to zirconia abutments. ConclusionsAfter simulating five years of clinical use, the externally hexed implants, analyzed by 3 D profilometry, showed similar wear patterns in the corresponding seating platforms when connected to zirconia or titanium abutments. The SEM images showed zirconia particles being transferred to the implant, which requires further study...|$|R

40|$|The {{range of}} vasoconstrictors {{available}} for use with local anesthetics in dentistry has been reviewed with emphasis on epinephrine and its physiological effects.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} composite resin consistency and placement technique on proximal contact tightness of Class II composite resin restorations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A manikin model (KaVo Dental) was used with an artificial first molar in which a standardized MO preparation was ground. This preparation was duplicated 360 times. Cavities were restored using Clearfil Photo Bond (Kuraray) combined with one of three composite resins of different consistencies: a low-viscosity (X-Flow, Dentsply), a medium-viscosity (Clearfil AP-X, Kuraray) and a high-viscosity composite (Tetric Ceram HB, Ivoclar Vivadent). Each composite was combined with 6 different matrix systems and separation techniques (n = 20). Groups 1 and 2 : precontoured metal circumferential matrix (KerrHawe 1101 -c) in a Tofflemire retainer combined either with hand instrument (OptraContact, Ivoclar Vivadent) or separation ring (Composi-Tight Gold, Garrison <b>Dental</b> <b>Solutions).</b> Group 3 : pre-contoured metal sectional matrix (Lite-Flex, Danville Materials) with separation ring. Groups 4 and 5 : pre-contoured metal circumferential dead-soft matrix (Adapt SuperCap, KerrHawe) with or without separation ring. Group 6 : flat metal circumferential matrix (OptraMatrix, Ivoclar Vivadent) in a Tofflemire-retainer with hand instrument (OptraContact). Proximal contact tightness was measured using the Tooth Pressure Meter (University of Technology, Delft). To {{determine the effect of}} experimental variables on the proximal contact tightness, a multiple linear regression model was constructed. RESULTS: Measurements in group 6 were not possible; therefore, this group was excluded. The use of medium- or high-viscosity instead of a low-viscosity composite resin resulted in statistically significantly tighter proximal contacts (p < 0. 01). The use of a separation ring resulted in a large, statistically significant increase (p < 0. 001) in contact tightness, while the use of a hand instrument resulted in a small, statistically significant increase of contact tightness (p = 0. 017). No statistically significant differences were found when a dead-soft matrix or a sectional matrix was used instead of a Tofflemire (p = 0. 159, p = 0. 261, resp.). CONCLUSION: Use of a separation ring when restoring a Class II composite resin restoration has a greater influence on the obtained proximal contact tightness compared to the influence of the consistency of the composite resin...|$|R
40|$|TT {{is known}} that {{complete}} or partial dental anesthesia at times persists too l long after the operative procedure {{for which it was}} needed. The duration of this undesirable residual numbness of lips, cheeks, and, sometimes also, of the tongue may vary depending {{on the nature of the}} anesthetic solution used. Efforts toward the solution of this problem have led to the use of short-acting local anesthetics. Another possibility of minimizing this undesirable residual effect would be the acceleration of the disappearance of anesthesia by the in-jection of the anesthetized area with appropriate solutions. The use of an-tagonists of the drugs contained in the anesthetic solution suggests itself for this purpose. However, no drugs are known which would produce this effect by directly antagonizing the effect of local anesthetics on nerve conduction. On the other hand, practically all <b>dental</b> anesthetic <b>solutions</b> contain a sym-pathomimetic vasoconstrictor, and drugs are available which can inhibit the effect of this type of vasoconstrictor.

40|$|Background: Finland {{has since}} 1972 had a {{primary health care}} system based on health centres run and funded by the local public {{authorities}} called ‘municipalities’. On the world map of primary health care systems, the Finnish solution {{claims to be the}} most health centre oriented and also the widest, both in terms of the numbers of staff and also of different professions employed. Offering integrated care through multiprofessional health centres has been overshadowed by exceptional difficulties in guaranteeing a reasonable access to the population at times when they need primary medical or <b>dental</b> services. <b>Solutions</b> to the problems of access have been found, but they do not seem durable. Description of policy practice: During the past 10 years, the health centres have become a ground of active development structural change, for which no end is in sight. Broader issues of municipal and public administration structures are being solved through rearranging primary health services. In these rearrangements, integration with specialist services and with social services together with mergers of health centres and municipalities are occurring at an accelerated pace. This leads into fundamental questions of the benefits of integration, especially if extensive integration leads into the threat of the loss of identity for primary health care.

40|$|Background: The {{systemic}} effects {{attributable to}} the injection of <b>dental</b> local anesthetic <b>solutions</b> {{have been the subject}} of discussion for many years. Aim and Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate the biochemical and hemodynamic effects of adrenaline in lignocaine local anesthetic solutions when used in clinical doses in patients undergoing third molar surgery under general anesthesia. Materials and Methods: Of the total 30 patients, 15 were given local anesthetic solution containing adrenaline and the other 15 were given the same without adrenaline. Hemodynamic and biochemical parameters were recorded at considerable intervals. The changes from the pre-local anesthetic (baseline) values with each treatment were compared by analysis of variance and Student′s t-test. The changes within each treatment were compared by the paired t-test. Results and Conclusion: This study shows that exogenous adrenaline administration in clinical doses produces systemic effects even in conditions where the endogenous release of the catecholamines would be expected to be considerable...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is present a new {{approach}} to modelling and design the low cost mono-block dental implants based on the integration of the computer aided techniques. This approach provides the automation of the design process of the mono-block dental implants. Design/methodology/approach: The approach used to develop the modelling and design of the mono-block dental implants are based on the parametrization of the main geometric features of the implants. This approach allows to generate several designs of the implant with different configurations respect to the dimensions, forms and tolerances. Findings: The findings are focused on two main topics. The first one is the minimization of the manufacturing cost and time based on the manufacture process automation. The second one is the integration, in the same informatics platform, of the design, analysis and manufacturing environment. Research limitations/implications: The implications are focused on {{the development of a new}} design of mono-block dental implants. One of the main features of this design is associated to the reduction of the surgical stage and their simplification respect to other commercial implants.

40|$|AbstractIntroduction: Dental radiographs are darkened in {{some cases}} due to overexposure, high {{concentration}} of developing solution etc. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of various undiluted fixing solutions on decreasing the density of dark radiographs. Materials and Methods: In this analytical cross-sectional study, 95 periapical radiographs were taken from the first mandibular molar of a dry skull. One film was developed under optimal conditions and considered as gold standard or the positive control; 93 films were overexposed to enter the study. The last film was overexposed, was not included in the study and was considered the negative control to compare the effect of fixing agent. All the radiographs were processed automatically under the same conditions. Then the overexposed radiographs were divided into three equal groups of 31 radiographs. Each set was immersed in different undiluted fixing solutions, including Champion, Cronex, and Teif Saz. Finally, the densities of radiographic films were assessed objectively by a densitometer and subjectively by obtaining questionnaires from observing dental practitioners. Data was analyzed by ANOVA and Duncan test (α = 0. 05). Results: The densities of all the radiographs had significantly decreased after immersion in undiluted fixing agents. Furthermore, improvements in diagnostic quality of the darkened radiographs were significant due to the effect of undiluted fixing agents (p value < 0. 001). Conclusion: Generally, the undiluted fixing solution is a suitable agent to decrease the density and restore the diagnostic quality to dark radiographs, preventing re-exposure of patients and avoiding extra costs.
