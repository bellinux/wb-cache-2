40|$|Long {{instrumental}} climate records {{suffer from}} inhomogeneities due to, e. g., relocations of the stations or changes in instrumentation, which may introduce sudden {{jumps into the}} time series. These inhomogeneities may mask or strengthen true trends. Relative homogenization algorithms use the difference time series of a candidate station with neighboring stations to identify such breaks (changepoints). Modern multiple breakpoint methods search for the optimum segmentation, which is characterized by minimum internal variance within the segments and maximum <b>external</b> <b>variance</b> between the segment means. We analyze the accuracy of these homogenization methods and concentrate on the uncertainty {{in the position of}} the break. Due to unavoidable random noise in the difference time series, the segmentation method may find a shifted break position, which attains a higher <b>external</b> <b>variance</b> than the true one. Different lengths of potentially exchanged subsegments are considered; that one providing the largest <b>external</b> <b>variance</b> will be chosen as possibly erroneous optimum. We will show that the variances of shifted segmentations can be described as Brownian motion with drift, where the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) defines the drift size. Available formulae for one-sided and continuous Brownian motion with drift are expanded to two-sided and discrete processes as they occur in praxis. The error probability increases strongly for SNRs lower than 1. Thus when the internal variance is larger than the variance introduced by the breaks, the probability of finding the right break position is small...|$|E

40|$|Escherichia coli {{has been}} the {{organism}} of choice {{for the production of}} many recombinant proteins with high therapeutic value. However, while the research on molecular biology has allowed the development of very strong promoters, there are still several phenomena associated with this process that have hampered the full use of that promoter strength, namely the aerobic acetate production associated with high specific growth rates. The presence of acetate is known to reduce both biomass yield on the chosen carbon source and protein productivity while totally inhibiting growth when present at high concentrations due to its toxic effect. While there have been several studies covering the recombinant protein production process with the bacterium Escherichia coli, including genome-scale analysis of the transcriptome, proteome, fluxome or metabolome, there has been a lack of an integrative approach that is able to combine genomic and physiological information about those processes with high-throughput analysis. Also, the existence of genome-scale models that cover both stoichiometry and regulation of some pathways has not been taken into account in genome-scale data analysis and for the consequent formulation of hypothesis and development of new strategies for improving the performance of the process. In our group, a high-cell density fed-batch process for recombinant protein production in E. coli is being studied, giving particular relevance to acetate production. A systematic approach is being used, by first compiling the existing knowledge about this phenomenon, extending existing genome-scale models to accommodate that knowledge, derive hypothesis in silico that are then tested by using genome-scale analysis of the omes. A reliable fermentation process was developed to be able to reproducibly study this phenomenon in different strains in order to reduce <b>external</b> <b>variances</b> to a minimum...|$|R

40|$|White pixel {{noise is}} widely used to {{estimate}} the level of internal noise in a system by injecting <b>external</b> <b>variance</b> into the detecting mechanism. Recent work (Baker & Meese, 2012, J Vis, 12 (10) : 20) has provided psychophysical evidence that such noise masks might also cause suppression that could invalidate estimates of internal noise. Here we measure neural population responses directly, using steady-state visual evoked potentials, elicited by target stimuli embedded in different mask types. Sinusoidal target gratings of 1 c/deg flickered at 5 Hz, and were shown in isolation, or with superimposed orthogonal grating masks or 2 D white noise masks, flickering at 7 Hz. Compared with responses to a blank screen, the Fourier amplitude at the target frequency increased monotonically {{as a function of}} target contrast when no mask was present. Both orthogonal and white noise masks caused rightward shifts of the contrast response function, providing evidence of contrast gain control suppression. We also calculated within-observer amplitude variance across trials. This increased in proportion to the target response, implying signal-dependent (i. e. multiplicative) noise at the system level, the implications of which we discuss for behavioural tasks. This measure of variance was reduced by both mask types, consistent with the changes in mean target response. An alternative variety of noise, which we term zero-dimensional noise, involves trial-by-trial jittering of the target contrast. This type of noise produced no gain control suppression, and increased the amplitude variance across trials...|$|E
40|$|This {{technical}} report discusses some mathematical details of regression estimators under two or three-phase sampling with two-stage sampling of {{trees at the}} plot level. Discussions with colleagues and graduate students convinced me that the mathematical derivations presented (and often simply sketched) in previous work deserved clarification. This is par-ticularly true, because of space restriction, for the papers Mandallaz (2013 a), Mandallaz et al. (2013), Mandallaz (2014) {{and to a lesser}} degree for the the book Mandallaz (2008) and the {{technical report}}s (Mandallaz (2012), Mandallaz (2013 c), Mandallaz (2013 b)). The great physicist and Nobel prize laureate Richard Feynman once said, after a life-time frequentation of mathematicians, that he finally understood what the word obvious re-ally means, namely proved. Of course, the level he was referring to is stratospheric in comparison with the down-to-earth properties of regression estimators in forest inventory. Nevertheless, I thought it would not be harmful, a few months before my retirement, to clarify some theoretical issues in survey sampling, in particular the differences between design-based model-assisted versus model-dependent inference, which are not always well understood by practitioners, as I can now judge after 25 years experience as a reviewer and author. It turns out that all the previously published results are indeed correct, at least asymptotically. The main point is that one can use mutatis mutandis the two-phase/three-phase one-stage formulae also with two-stage sampling at the plot level. The second-stage variance resulting from Poisson sampling at the plot level is so to speak automatically taken into account. This holds in particular for the easy to use so-called <b>external</b> <b>variances.</b> In contrast to previous work the notation is more pedantic, which is the price to pay to be as clear and accurate as possible. 1...|$|R

40|$|The Community Climate Model (CCM 3) {{from the}} National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) {{is used to}} {{investigate}} {{the effect of the}} South Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies on interannual to decadal variability of South American precipitation. Two ensembles composed of multidecadal simulations forced with monthly SST data from the Hadley Centre for the period 1949 to 2001 are analysed. A statistical treatment based on signal-to-noise ratio and Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) is applied to the ensembles {{in order to reduce the}} internal variability among the integrations. The ensemble treatment shows a spatial and temporal dependence of reproducibility. High degree of reproducibility is found in the tropics while the extratropics is apparently less reproducible. Austral autumn (MAM) and spring (SON) precipitation appears to be more reproducible over the South America-South Atlantic region than the summer (DJF) and winter (JJA) rainfall. While the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) region is dominated by <b>external</b> <b>variance,</b> the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) over South America is predominantly determined by internal variance, which makes it a difficult phenomenon to predict. Alternatively, the SACZ over western South Atlantic appears to be more sensitive to the subtropical SST anomalies than over the continent. An attempt is made to separate the atmospheric response forced by the South Atlantic SST anomalies from that associated with the El Niño – Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Results show that both the South Atlantic and Pacific SSTs modulate the intensity and position of the SACZ during DJF. Particularly, the subtropical South Atlantic SSTs are more important than ENSO in determining the position of the SACZ over the southeast Brazilian coast during DJF. On the other hand, the ENSO signal seems to influence the intensity of the SACZ not only in DJF but especially its oceanic branch during MAM. Both local and remote influences, however, are confounded by the large internal variance in the region. During MAM and JJA, the South Atlantic SST anomalies affect the magnitude and the meridional displacement of the ITCZ. In JJA, the ENSO has relatively little influence on the interannual variability of the simulated rainfall. During SON, however, the ENSO seems to counteract the effect of the subtropical South Atlantic SST variations on convection over South America...|$|E

Of particular interest was whether neighbourhood effects remained after adjusting for individual demographic characteristics and socioeconomic status.  DESIGN—Census tract data (measuring small area socioeconomic status, racial concentration, residential stability, urbanisation, and family structure) was merged with the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and a file that links the respondents to subsequent follow up of vital status and cause of death data. Cox proportional hazards models were specified to determine individual and neighbourhood effects on homicide, suicide, motor vehicle deaths, and other <b>external</b> causes. <b>Variances</b> are adjusted for the clustered sample design of the NHIS.  SETTING—United States, 1987 - 1994, with follow up to the end of 1995.  PARTICIPANTS—From a sample of 472   364 persons ages 18 - 64, there were 1195  injury related deaths over the follow up period.  MAIN RESULTS—Individual level effects were generally robust to the inclusion of neighbourhood level variables in the models. Neighbourhood characteristics had independent effects on the outcome even after adjustment for individual variability. For example, there was approximately a twofold increased risk of homicide associated with living in a neighborhood characterised by low socioeconomic status, after adjusting for individual demographic and socioeconomic characteristics.  CONCLUSIONS—Social inequalities in injury mortality exist for both persons and places. Policies or interventions aimed at preventing or controlling injuries should take into account not only the socioeconomic characteristics of people but also of the places in which they live.    Keywords: socioeconomic status; injury; neighborhoo...|$|R

Our major {{finding is that}} both above classes of processes stay in affinity and may share common stationary (eventually asymptotic) probability density, even if their detailed dynamical behavior look different.

40|$|AbstractThe {{bacterial}} flagellar motor {{is generally}} {{supposed to be}} a stepping mechanism. The main evidence for this is based on a fluctuation analysis of experiments with tethered bacteria in which rotation frequency was varied by applying an <b>external</b> torque: the <b>variance</b> in time taken for a fixed number of revolutions was found to be essentially proportional to the inverse square of the frequency. This behavior was shown to characterize a Poissonian stepper. Here we present a rigorous kinetic and stochastic analysis of elastic crossbridge stepping in tethered bacteria. We demonstrate that Poissonian stepping is a virtually unachievable limit. To the extent that a system may approach Poissonian stepping it cannot be influenced by an externally applied torque; stepping mechanisms capable of being so influenced are necessarily non-Poissonian and exhibit an approximately inverse cubic dependence. This conclusion applies whatever the torsional characteristics of the tether may be, and contrary to claims, no perceptible relaxation of the tether following each step is found. Furthermore, the inverse square dependence is a necessary but not sufficient condition for Poissonian stepping, since a nonstepping mechanism, which closely reproduces most experimental data, also fulfills this condition. Hence the inference that crossbridge-type stepping occurs is not justified...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well-known}} that gene activation/deactivation dynamics {{may be a}} major source of randomness in genetic networks, also in the case of large concentrations of the transcription factors. In this work, we investigate the effect of realistic extrinsic noises acting on gene deactivation in a common network motif - the positive feedback of a transcription factor on its own synthesis - under a variety of settings, i. e., distinct cellular types, distribution of proteins and properties of the <b>external</b> perturbations. At <b>variance</b> with standard models where the perturbations are Gaussian unbounded, we focus here on bounded extrinsic noises to better mimic biological reality. Our results suggest that the gene switching velocity is a key parameter to modulate the response of the network. Simulations suggest that, if the gene switching is fast and many proteins are present, an irreversible noise-induced first order transition is observed {{as a function of the}} noise intensity. If noise intensity is further increased a second order transition is also observed. When gene switching is fast, a similar scenario is observed even when few proteins are present, provided that larger cells are considered, which is mainly influenced by noise autocorrelation. On the contrary, if the gene switching is slow, no fist order transitions are observed. In the concluding remarks possible implications of the irreversible transitions for cellular differentiation are briefly discussed. Comment: 22 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

In addition, this study examined the relationship of channel transaction form with decision processes and structures. ^ A theoretical model based on the political economy framework explicated hypothesized relationships. The channel 2 ̆ 7 s <b>external</b> political economy (<b>variance</b> in environmental dimensions such as capacity, dynamism, and complexity) was hypothesized to result in decision making uncertainty. This uncertainty was then expected to affect the channel 2 ̆ 7 s internal economy, specifically, to lead to more vertically integrated transaction forms. Uncertainty was also expected to result in flexible decision structures (informalized, decentralized, unstandardized, and nonspecialized) and more participative decision processes (consensus and both more and balanced communication). ^ Results from a mail survey of farm equipment dealers suggested that capacity is a major determinant of uncertainty. Uncertainty had little direct effect on decision structures and appeared to squelch rather than enhance channel communication. Uncertainty related positively to vertically integrated channel transaction form. Transaction form related to inflexible decision structures and nonparticipative decision processes. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{parts of}} New Zealand, {{economic}} drivers are causing intensification of dairying {{in order to}} maintain a competitive advantage for low-cost milk production. These practices have contributed to increased nitrate leaching, which has resulted in a regulatory push to reduce these adverse environmental effects. A method of reducing this degradation of water quality is to remove cows from pasture during ‘at-risk’ periods, and move them into a housing structure, to capture their effluent for reapplication at a later date. This study examined both the environmental and economic impacts of incorporating a housing structure within the Lincoln University Dairy Farm (LUDF), by modelling proposed housing-incorporated systems and restricted grazing practices with both Overseer® 6 and ExcelTM. An investment analysis indicated the pre-tax and pre-financing real (constant value dollars) IRR (over a 12 year period) of the current system is 7. 63 %, the fully enclosed freestall system was 7. 24 % and the roofless version of this system was 7. 82 %. This resulted in an increase in marginal returns of 4. 66 % (housed) and 9. 41 % (roofless). This suggests that the proposed systems could maintain or increase relative profitability, while reducing the nitrate leaching levels by 38 %. Contributing factors to increased profitability and relative increased milk production in the proposed systems are increased pasture production, extended lactation and increased supplementary feeding, as well as reductions in fertiliser application. Supplementary feed utilisation is also improved. A sensitivity analysis predicted that the proposed systems still remained viable with changing milk price, supplementary feed costs, total farm working expenses and machinery costs, although decreasing milk production significantly reduced profitability. A potential disadvantage of this practice is the capital cost of erecting such a structure. The fully enclosed structure cost $ 2, 390, 500, and the roofless structure cost $ 1, 529, 500. This resulted in a capital cost per kg of N leaching mitigated of $ 995 and $ 637 respectively, although this capital was compensated by increased income. Significant risks to the proposed systems include <b>external</b> price <b>variance</b> and a lack of previous adoption. It is concluded that a housing-incorporated system in Canterbury is economically and environmentally viable, although practical-based research is required to ensure feasibility...|$|R

The 10 sample countries constitute the six GCC Countries and the four Agadir nations. Methodology Approach Macroeconomic data for the 34 year period 1970 to 2003 is used. Feasibility is examined by analyzing the symmetry of response of countries within each group to a common external shock. The impulse response functions (IRF) from a Vector Autoregression Model is used. The strength of lingkages within each economic bloc was examined using Pearson pairwise correlation and variance decomposition. Findings Among GCC countries, the results show the existence of strong lingkages among the monetary variables, signifying strong monetary sector integration. Such integration however is lacking where the real sector is concerned. Despite the symmetry seen in the impulse response functions, variance decomposition showed {{the absence of any}} meaningful influence of countries on each other within the bloc. Amongst the Agadir nations, the results show no correlation in real output growth, some correlation among monetary variables but no symmetry whatsoever in response to <b>external</b> shocks. The <b>variance</b> decomposition too did not show mutual influence intra group. Implications The lack of real sector integration will present a challenge to GCC’s desired goal of a CCA by 2010.

Agriculture, a large part of rural livelihoods, {{turns out to be the}} largest user of groundwater, an increasingly declining common pool resource (CPR). India is the world’s largest groundwater extractor for combined agriculture and drinking purposes and offers a challenging arena for groundwater governance. Recent trends in decentralization in the form of community based natural {{resource management}} (CBNRM) are slowly making their way to groundwater regulation. This work uses a CPR experiment replicated with students from all disciplines at the University of Michigan (n= 50), The University of Delhi (n= 75) and residents of six villages in three different states of India (n= 360) to study the differences in extraction decisions across locations and livelihoods in a groundwater setting and test theories of collective action involving the concept of social capital. Post experiment surveys and interviews were also conducted to augment and explain the experimental results. The main findings are that student groups differ from rural participants in extraction choices but only in treatments that involve voting for a costly external enforcement of rule adherence on the commons. While the two student groups were not statistically different in extraction levels across all treatments, Indian students differed from Indian rural participants in the experimental treatment involving a costly <b>external</b> monitor. The <b>variance</b> in decision making by subject group is attributed to differences in preferences, beliefs and experience. Evidence for this is found in the post game interviews and surveys conducted with each group. This furthers the findings of recent work on the role of social framing in decision making. Additionally, social capital was marginally significant in lowering extraction levels but institutions were more so. 	Broadly, my findings indicate that decentralization policy for groundwater will be a negotiated process that needs to consider the tensions within populations.
