5|$|A {{more recent}} {{tradition}} (started in 1987) is Dunster by Candlelight {{which takes place}} every year on the first Friday and Saturday in December when this remarkably preserved medieval village turns its back on the present and lights its streets with candles. To {{mark the beginning of}} the festival on Friday at 5 pm, there is the Lantern Lighting Procession that starts on the Steep and continues through the village until all the lanterns in the streets have been lit. The procession of children and their <b>families</b> <b>is</b> accompanied by colourful stilt walkers in costumes who put up the lanterns.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{generally}} agreed that the aye-aye is the most basal member of the lemur clade, {{the relationship between the}} other four <b>families</b> <b>is</b> less clear since they diverged during a narrow 10 to 12million-year window between the Late Eocene (42mya) and into the Oligocene (30mya). Although all studies place Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae as a sister clade to Indriidae and Lemuridae, some suggest that Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae diverged first, while others suggest that Indriidae and Lemuridae were the first to branch off.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{functional}} dependency (FD) (implicational dependency) (ID)) <b>family</b> <b>is</b> a <b>family</b> of relational database instances consisting of all instances which satisfy a given set of FDs (IDs). An ID <b>family</b> <b>is</b> finitely specifiable {{if it can}} be defined using a finite set of IDs. It is known that all FD <b>families</b> <b>are</b> finitely specifiable ID families, and also that each projection of each FD family, while not necessarily an FD <b>family,</b> <b>is</b> an ID <b>family.</b> It <b>is</b> shown here that if the projection of an FD <b>family</b> <b>is</b> not an FD <b>family,</b> then it <b>is</b> not a finitely specifiable ID family...|$|R

5|$|Education of <b>families</b> <b>is</b> {{critical}} in developing strategies for understanding strengths and weaknesses; helping {{the family to}} cope improves outcomes in children.

There are legal implications for individuals with AS as they run the risk of exploitation by others and may be unable to comprehend the societal implications of their actions.|$|E

5|$|Textual {{critics have}} had a {{challenging}} task in classifying the Codex, the exact relationship to other known texts and <b>families</b> <b>is</b> still disputed. The Greek text of the codex is of mixed text-types. It is {{a representative of the}} Byzantine text-type in the Gospels - the oldest examples of the type - {{and the rest of the}} New Testament books are of the Alexandrian text-type, with some Western readings. Kurt Aland placed it in Category III in the Gospels, and in Category I in rest of the books of the New Testament. The Byzantine text of the Gospels has a number of Alexandrian features, it has some affinities to the textual Family Π. Soden associated the text of the gospels with Family Π, though it is not a pure member of this family. According to Streeter, it is the earliest Greek manuscript which gives us approximately the text of Lucian the Martyr, but a small proportion of the readings seem to be earlier.|$|E
