RealFlow is a standalone {{commercial package}} {{that has been}} used to produce visual effects in movies, television shows, commercials, and games. RealFlow implements a fluid-implicit particle (FLIP) solver, a hybrid grid, and a particle method that allows for advanced features such as foam and spray. Maya and Houdini are two other 3D computer <b>graphics</b> <b>programs</b> that enable fluid animation. Blender 3D is an open source 3D computer <b>graphics</b> <b>program</b> that utilizes a particle-based Lattice Boltzmann method for animating fluids.|$|R
50|$|Logo {{was created}} in 1967 at Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN), a Cambridge, Massachusetts {{research}} firm, by Wally Feurzeig, Cynthia Solomon, and Seymour Papert. Its intellectual roots are in artificial intelligence, mathematical logic and developmental psychology. The first four years of Logo research, development and teaching work was done at BBN. The first implementation of Logo, called Ghost, was written in LISP on a PDP-1. The goal {{was to create a}} mathematical land where children could play with words and sentences. Modeled on LISP, the design goals of Logo included accessible power and informative error messages. The use of virtual Turtles allowed for immediate visual feedback and debugging of <b>graphic</b> <b>programming.</b>|$|E
50|$|Coniglio remains {{particularly}} interested in creating custom interactive systems that allow the movements or vocalizations of dancers to manipulate video, sound, and light in real-time. His first technological breakthrough in this area came in 1989 when he created MidiDancer, a wireless system that measured the angular change at several joints on the dancer's body, allowing the performer interactively control music. He later collaborated with Morton Subotnick to create Interactor, a <b>graphic</b> <b>programming</b> tool that allowed real time manipulate of MIDI audio and other digital media. He continued this process when he created Isadora. Initially created solely to realize the works of Troika Ranch, Isadora is currently in use by hundreds of artists worldwide to facilitate the creation of their interactive performance works or installations.|$|E
50|$|Direct3D {{comes with}} D3DX, {{a library of}} tools {{designed}} to perform common mathematical calculations on vectors, matrices and colours, calculating look-at and projection matrices, spline interpolations, and several more complicated tasks, such as compiling or assembling shaders used for 3D <b>graphic</b> <b>programming,</b> compressed skeletal animation storage and matrix stacks. There are several functions that provide complex operations over 3D meshes like tangent-space computation, mesh simplification, precomputed radiance transfer, optimizing for vertex cache friendliness and stripification, and generators for 3D text meshes. 2D features include classes for drawing screen-space lines, text and sprite based particle systems. Spatial functions include various intersection routines, conversion from/to barycentric coordinates and bounding box/sphere generators. D3DX is provided as a dynamic link library (DLL). D3DX is deprecated from Windows 8 onward and can't be used in Windows Store apps.|$|E
