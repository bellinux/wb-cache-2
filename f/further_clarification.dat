5|$|At the time, HBO {{made their}} {{commitments}} {{for only one}} year at a time, a third season would have meant opening up a new two-season book in Daniel Knauf's six-year plan, including {{the introduction of new}} storylines for current and new characters, and <b>further</b> <b>clarification</b> and elaboration on the show's mythology. HBO announced that the show had been cancelled on May 11, 2005. HBO's president Chris Albrecht said the network would have considered otherwise if the producers had been willing to lower the price of an episode to US$2million; but the running costs for the sizable cast, the all-on-location shooting and the number of episodes per season were too enormous for them.|$|E
5|$|The International Air Transport Association (IATA)—an {{industry}} trade organisation representing over 240 airlines (representing 84% of global air traffic)—and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)—the United Nations' civil aviation body—began working on implementing new measures to track aircraft in flight in real time. The IATA created {{a task force}} (which included several outside stakeholders) to define a minimal set of requirements that any tracking system must meet, allowing airlines to decide the best solution to track their aircraft. The IATA's task force planned {{to come up with}} several short-, medium-, and long-term solutions to ensure that information is provided in a timely manner to support search, rescue, and recovery activities in the wake of an aircraft accident. The task force was expected to provide a report to the ICAO on 30 September 2014, but on that day said that the report would be delayed, citing the need for <b>further</b> <b>clarification</b> on some issues. In December 2014, the IATA task force recommended that, within 12 months, airlines track commercial aircraft in no longer than 15-minute intervals, although it still has not released its report and full details of proposed changes. The IATA itself did not support the deadline, which it believes cannot be met by all airlines, but the proposed standard has the support of the ICAO. Although the ICAO can set standards, it has no legal authority and such standards must be adopted by member states.|$|E

25|$|At {{around the}} same time, the Moldavian Central Committee took steps to create a Bessarabian {{national}} force within Russia's Army, with Vasile Cijevschi as Commander. The request {{was presented to the}} Stavka (supreme command of the Russian forces) in Mogilev. It provided an ambiguous response, and Pântea led a delegation to request <b>further</b> <b>clarification.</b> On their way through Kiev, the Bessarabian envoys chanced upon Romania's own delegates to Russia: Dinu Brătianu and Constantin Iancovescu. The two missions shared a train carriage, and the time they shared prompted Stavka staff to suspect a conspiracy. The Bessarabians tried to mend the situation, and Pântea had interviews with Commander Nikolay Dukhonin and Russian Premier Alexander Kerensky. Pântea later wrote that Kerensky was the most welcoming, allowing the gradual creation of a single Bessarabian army (and even promising to transfer the Odessa 40th Regiment its jurisdiction), but forbidding any unilateral Bessarabian decision on this matter.|$|E

25|$|Capt. Robert G. Coman {{reported}} as Lafayettes prospective commanding officer on 31 January 1942, overseeing a skeleton engineering force numbering 458 men. The complicated nature and enormous {{size of the}} conversion effort prevented Coman's crew from adhering to the original schedule; crew familiarization with the vessel was an issue, and additional crew members were arriving to assist the effort. On 6 February 1942, {{a request for a}} two-week delay for the first sailing of Lafayette, originally scheduled for 14 February, was submitted to the Assistant Chief of Naval Operations. On that day, a schedule extension was granted due to a design plan change: elements of the superstructure were to be removed to improve stability, in work that was expected to take another 60 to 90 days. However, on 7 February, orders came from Washington that the reduction of the top-hamper had been abandoned and Lafayette was to sail on 14 February as planned. This abrupt reversal necessitated a frantic resumption of conversion work, and Capts Coman and Simmers scheduled 9 February meetings in New York and Washington to lobby for <b>further</b> <b>clarification</b> of conversion plans; ultimately, these meetings would never take place.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} mirror symmetry for (essentially arbitrary) hypersurfaces in (possibly noncompact) toric varieties {{from the}} perspective of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow (SYZ) conjecture. Given a hypersurface H in a toric variety V we construct a Landau-Ginzburg model which is SYZ mirror to the blowup of V×C along H× 0, under a positivity assumption. This construction also yields SYZ mirrors to affine conic bundles, as well as a Landau-Ginzburg model which can be naturally viewed as a mirror to H. The main applications concern affine hypersurfaces of general type, for which our results provide a geometric basis for various mirror symmetry statements that appear in the recent literature. We also obtain analogous results for complete intersections.

500|$|The {{earliest}} known written {{version of}} the Laws of Cricket, dating from 1744, does not include an lbw rule. At the time, batsmen in English cricket used curved bats, which made it unlikely {{that they would be}} able to stand directly in front of the wickets. However, a clause in the 1744 laws gave umpires the power to take action if the batsman was [...] "standing unfair to strike". Cricket bats were modified to become straighter over the following years, allowing batsmen to stand closer to the wickets. Subsequently, some players deliberately began to obstruct the ball from hitting the wickets. Such tactics were criticised by writers and a revision of the laws in 1774 ruled that the batsman was out if he deliberately stopped the ball from hitting the wicket with his leg. However, critics noted that the umpires were left the difficult task of interpreting the intentions of batsmen. The 1788 {{version of the}} laws no longer required the umpires to take account of the batsman's intent; now a batsman was lbw if he stopped a ball that [...] "pitch straight". <b>Further</b> <b>clarification</b> of the law came in 1823, when a condition was added that [...] "the ball must be delivered in a straight line to the wicket". The ambiguity of the wording was highlighted when two prominent umpires disagreed over whether the ball had to travel in a straight line from the bowler to the wicket, or between the wickets at either end of the pitch. In 1839 the MCC, by then responsible for drafting the Laws of Cricket, endorsed the latter interpretation and ruled the batsman out lbw if the ball pitched in between the wickets and would have hit the stumps.|$|E
