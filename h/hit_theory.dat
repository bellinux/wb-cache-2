30|$|Mitochondrial genome is {{responsible}} for multiple human diseases in a maternal inherited pattern, yet phenotypes of patients in a same pedigree frequently vary largely. Genes involving in epigenetic modification, RNA processing, and other biological pathways, rather than “threshold effect” and environmental factors, provide more specific explanation to the aberrant phenotype. Thus, the double <b>hit</b> <b>theory,</b> mutations both in mitochondrial DNA and modifying genes aggravating the symptom, throws new light on mitochondrial dysfunction processes. In addition, mitochondrial retrograde signaling pathway that leads to reconfiguration of cell metabolism to adapt defects in mitochondria may as well play an active role.

Considerations of the variance inherent in evolutionary estimations are also presented which show the REH model to produce no more variance than other evolutionary models. In the reply, it is argued that, despite the objections raised, REH theory applied to proteins gives inaccurate estimates of total gene substitutions.

40|$|When a swift ion is {{slowed down}} through a plastic {{detector}} {{it creates a}} latent track. In nuclear track detectors, this latent track can be specifically etched by an appropriate chemical solution.

ICs were formed between blood group A and B erythrocytes (solid phase) or synthetic blood group A and B active trisaccharides (fluid phase) respectively, and anti-A/anti-B monoclonal (IgM) blood group antibodies (mAb). We {{found that the}} lytic capacity of the human serum was already reduced when the estimated molecular concentration of complement components per erythrocytes were in large excess suggesting that the lytic capacity could be significantly smaller than that one would expect according to the one <b>hit</b> <b>theory</b> of complement-mediated lysis (Mayer M.

It was used to estimate reactions in undiluted serum containing a physiological erythrocyte concentration, which cannot be measured directly. The model predicted that: (i) up to 40 % of all the erythrocytes could be lysed; (ii) the lytic capacity can be significantly reduced by preincubation with 10 to 100 mg/ml ICs.

40|$|Background: Retinoblastoma (Rb) is {{the most}} common primary {{malignant}} intraocular tumour in childhood. The "two hit" theory, formulated by Knudson in 1971 to explain the variegated clinical expression of the disease, led to the discovery of the so called tumour suppressor genes and the identification of the Rb 1 as the prototype of such genes. Mutations of the Rb 1 gene are now commonly believed to be the "cause" retinoblastoma, although epidemiological, clinical, and biological evidences argue against it. Material/Methods: The Authors have performed a systematic review of available data concerning clinical and diagnostic aspects of retinoblastoma, including molecular genetics. Meta analysis of literature data has been performed in order to validate some of the predictions made by the two <b>hit</b> <b>theory.</b> Results: The following theses are discussed in detail: 1) there is no difference in the age at diagnosis between unilateral and bilateral retinoblastoma; 2) the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying familial, hereditary, and sporadic retinoblastoma are different; 3) bilateral retinoblastoma is not necessarily hereditary; 4) The real incidence of the unilateral phenotype within the familial group is disproportionately higher than that predicted by the "two hit"; 5) retinoblastoma is most probably "caused" by the combination of epigenetic factors and aneuploidy. Conclusions: Epidemiological, clinical, and more recent biological and genetic evidences, show that the "two hit" theory represents a rather simplistic, outdated, and unreliable model to explain tumour development and clinical evolution of retinoblastoma...|$|E
40|$|Disruptions of {{cell death}} {{signalling}} occur in pathological processes, {{such as cancer}} and degenerative disease. Increased knowledge of cell death signalling has opened new areas of therapeutic research, and identifying key mediators of cell death has become increasingly important. Early triggering events in cell death may provide potential therapeutic targets, whereas agents affecting later signals may be more palliative in nature. A group of primary mediators are derivatives of the highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs), particularly oxygenated metabolites such as prostaglandins. HUFAs, esterified in cell membranes, act as critical signalling molecules in many pathological processes. Currently, agents affecting HUFA metabolism are widely prescribed in diseases involving disordered cell death signalling. However, partly due to rapid metabolism, their role in cell death signalling pathways is poorly characterized. Recently, HUFA-derived mediators, the resolvins/protectins and endocannabinoids, have added opportunities to target selective signals and pathways. This review {{will focus on the}} control of cell death by HUFA, eicosanoid (C 20 fatty acid metabolites) and docosanoid (C 22 metabolites), HUFA-derived lipid mediators, signalling elements in the micro-environment and their potential therapeutic applications. Further therapeutic approaches will involve cell and molecular biology, the multiple <b>hit</b> <b>theory</b> of disease progression and analysis of system plasticity. Advances in the cell biology of eicosanoid and docosanoid metabolism, together with structure/function analysis of HUFA-derived mediators, will be useful in developing therapeutic agents in pathologies characterized by alterations in cell death signalling...|$|E
2500|$|Ichiro {{made his}} Pacific League debut in 1992 {{at the age}} of 18, but {{he spent most of his}} first two seasons in the farm system because his then-manager, Shōzō Doi, refused to accept Ichiro's unorthodox swing. The swing was nicknamed [...] because of the pendulum-like motion of his leg, which shifts his weight forward as he swung the bat, and goes against {{conventional}} <b>hitting</b> <b>theory.</b> Even though he hit a home run off Hideo Nomo, who later won a National league Rookie of the Year Award as a Dodger, Ichiro was sent back to the farm system on that very day. In his second career game, he recorded his first ichi-gun (Japan's major professional league) hit in Japan's Pacific League against Hawks pitcher Keiji Kimura. In 1994 he benefited from the arrival of a new manager, Akira Ōgi, who played him every day in the second spot of the lineup. He was eventually moved to the leadoff spot for the Orix BlueWave, where his immediate productivity dissolved any misgivings about his unconventional swing. He set a Japanese single-season record with 210 hits, the first player ever to top 200 hits in a single season. Five other players have since done so: Matt Murton, Norichika Aoki (twice), Alex Ramírez, Tsuyoshi Nishioka, and Shogo Akiyama.

40|$|Consideration {{is given}} to the {{criticism}} of Nei and Tateno (1978) of the REH (random evolutionary <b>hits)</b> <b>theory</b> of genetic divergence in nucleic acids and proteins, and to their proposed alternative estimator of total fixed mutations designated X 2. It is argued that the assumption of nonuniform amino acid or nucleotide substitution will necessarily increase REH estimates relative to those made for a model where each locus has an equal likelihood of fixing mutations, thus the resulting value will not be an overestimation. The relative values of X 2 and measures calculated {{on the basis of the}} PAM and REH theories for the number of nucleotide substitutions necessary to explain a given number of observed amino acid differences between two homologous proteins are compared, and the smaller values of X 2 are attributed to (1) a mathematical model based on the incorrect assumption that an entire structural gene is free to fix mutations and (2) the assumptions of different numbers of variable codons for the X 2 and REH calculations. Results of a repeat of the computer simulations of Nei and Tateno are presented which, in contrast to the original results, confirm the REH theory. It is pointed out that while a negative correlation is observed between estimations of the fixation intensity per varion and the number of varions for a given pair of sequences, the correlation between the two fixation intensities and varion numbers of two different pairs of sequences need not be negative. Finally, REH theory is used to resolve a paradox concerning the high rate of covarion turnover and the nature of general function sites as permanent covarions...|$|R

40|$|Birt-Hogg-Dubé {{syndrome}} (BHD) is an {{autosomal dominant}} cancer syndrome characterised by benign skin tumours, renal tumours, and spontaneous pneumothorax. The gene has been mapped to chromo-some 17 p 11. 2 and recently identified, expressing a novel protein called folliculin. We report the clini-cal and genetic studies of four sporadic BHD cases and four families {{with a total}} of 23 affected subjects. Haplotype analysis of these families using BHD linked markers showed they did not share the same affected alleles, excluding common ancestry. Mutation analysis of the BHD gene identified two germline mutations on exon 11 (c. 1733 insC and c. 1733 delC) in three of four families as well as two of four sporadic cases. A novel somatic mutation, c. 1732 delTCinsAC, was detected in a BHD related chromophobe renal carcinoma. Our results confirmed the (C) 8 tract in exon 11 as a mutational hot spot in BHD and should always be considered for future genetic testing.

In order to {{maintain}} the same ion track size for all impacting ions, their initial velocity was kept constant at 1. 1 cm/ns. Under these conditions the deposited energy density in a single ion track changes {{as a result of the}} varying stopping power (dE/dx) of the projectiles in the material. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and UV-visible spectroscopy were used to characterize the irradiated targets. Damage cross sections (σ) for different chemical bonds, such as C-S and ring C-C bonds, are extracted from the IR data. For all analyzed IR bands, the values of σ scale roughly with the square of dE/dx (energy density in a single ion track). The absorption of the irradiated samples in the visible and UV region increases as a function of fluence. The rate of increase of absorption at a particular wavelength scales also as (dE/dx) n with n~ 2. The observed nonlinear dependence of the damage cross sections on the deposited energy density is considered in the light of two models: a statistical model based on the fluctuations of the energy deposited by the primary ions (<b>hit</b> <b>theory)</b> and an activation (thermal spike) model. It is found that the damage cross section is not determined directly by the initial deposited energy density distribution.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—Cerebellar haemangioblastoma occurs {{sporadically}} or as {{a component}} tumour of autosomal dominant von Hippel-Lindau disease. Biallelic inactivation of the VHL tumour suppressor gene, which is located on chromosome 3 p, {{has been shown to}} be involved in the pathogenesis of both tumour entities. Mechanisms of VHL inactivation are intragenic mutations, mitotic recombination events, and hypermethylation of the promoter region. The systematic and complete examination of these genetic and epigenetic phenomena in large series of von Hippel-Lindau disease related and sporadic hemangioblastomas has, thus far, not been performed.  METHODS—In the largest series to date, 29 von Hippel-Lindau disease associated and 13 sporadic haemangioblastomas were investigated for all suggested inactivating mechanisms of the VHL gene using single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP), loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and methylation analyses. Additionally, corresponding blood samples of all patients were screened for VHL germline mutations by SSCP and Southern blotting.  RESULTS—Germline mutations were identified in 94 % of patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease and their tumours and 62 % of these hemangioblastomas showed LOH of chromosome 3 p. Of the 13 sporadic tumours, 23 % showed a single somatic mutation of the VHL gene that was not present in the germline. 3 p LOH was identified in 50 % of informative sporadic tumours. No von Hippel-Lindau disease related or sporadic tumour demonstrated VHL promoter hypermethylation.  CONCLUSIONS—For most von Hippel-Lindau disease related haemangioblastomas, the inactivation or loss of both alleles of the VHL gene, as predicted by the Knudson two <b>hit</b> <b>theory,</b> is required. However, in a subset of tumours including most sporadic haemangioblastomas, the genetic pathways involved in tumorigenesis have yet to be defined and may represent alterations of a different pathway or pathways. ...|$|E

They can give us insight into the nature of our representations of objects: Have we evolved different neural systems for recognizing different categories of object? What kinds of knowledge are important for recognizing particular objects? How does visual similarity within a category influence object recognition and representation? What is the nature of our semantic knowledge about different objects? We review the evidence on category-specific impairments, arguing that deficits even for one class of object (e. g., living things) cannot be accounted for in terms of a single information processing disorder across all patients; problems arise at contrasting loci in different patients. The same apparent pattern of impairment can be produced by damage to different loci. According to a new processing framework for object recognition and naming, the hierarchical interactive <b>theory</b> (<b>HIT),</b> we have a hierarchy of highly interactive stored representations.
