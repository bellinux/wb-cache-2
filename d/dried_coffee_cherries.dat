Based {{on a survey}} of 700 Ugandan coffee-producing households conducted in 2008, I analyze a structural model which reflects the increasing complexity of coffee sale mode decisions in coffee marketing given price risk. I find that coffee unit values increase as market sales and levels of coffee processing at sale increase, while unit values decrease with farm gate sales and lower processing levels. Households that sell raw and/or <b>dried</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>cherries</b> at the farm gate have higher average discount rates than households that sell coffee as dried and processed cherries {{in the market and}} at hullers respectively. This finding indicates that cash constraints are a major factor underlying coffee sale mode decisions at household level. The analysis highlights the need for better targeted rural credit policies for both production and consumption in order to prevent secondary effects of cash constraints induced by price risk on coffee incomes in the short and medium terms...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The drying {{operation}} {{is one of}} the most important stages of the coffee production. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the influence of the ambient relative humidity (40, 50 and 60 %) in the natural process of coffee (Coffea Arabica L.) drying at different air temperatures (23 °C, 40 °C and 60 °C) using mathematical modeling, equilibrium moisture content, and enthalpy of vaporization. <b>Coffee</b> <b>cherries</b> natural processed and dried with a drier of fixed layer was used. The study was conducted at the Department of Engineering and Technology Center of Post-Harvest Café, of the Federal University of Lavras. The results showed that the equilibrium water content of the <b>coffee</b> <b>cherry</b> is directly proportional to the water activity, and decreased increasing temperature during the same water activity. The Oswin model showed the best fit to describe the phenomenon of hygroscopicity of the <b>coffee</b> <b>cherry.</b> The latent heat of desorption increased decreasing the water content and decreased increasing temperatures of the same water content. In addition, the Midilli model showed the best fit to the drying data. Furthermore, the Gibbs free energy increased increasing temperature, it’s their magnitude being was positive in the temperature range used in this study. In conclusion, the different ambient relative humidities did not significantly influenced the processes of <b>drying</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>cherries...</b>|$|R

Roasting of <b>dry</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>cherry</b> in two shapes process was studied in this work with flat and peaberry beans. The influences of temperature development and grain shape were evaluated with respect to bulk density, moisture reduction, swelling rate, changes in grain dimensions, pH, soluble solids, acidity, weight loss, reducing and non-reducing sugars, color and sensorial attributes. Three types of temperature development were compared: high temperature all the time (T 1); temperature increasing with time (T 2) and low temperature all the time (T 3) for flat and peaberry. Roasting T 1 and T 3 were developed on shorter periods for peaberry beans. The same was observed with T 2 for flat beans. Differences on bulk density, final moisture content, pH, swelling and soluble solids were also observed.

Analisando-se os ensaios que apresentaram êsse fenômeno, verificou-se que o gôsto estranho ocorria, geralmente, em amostras submetidas a' altas temperaturas de secagem e quando os testes organolépticos eram realizados após largo período de armazenamento. Dois lotes de café foram preparados em um ensaio para estudo da gustação, um constituído de cerejas não despolpadas e, outro, de cerejas despolpadas, lavadas e isentas de cascas.

In experiments {{carried out}} {{and later on}} submitted to the analysis in the Sensory Evaluation Laboratory, a new fact was noted: the panel members characterized the taste of some samples like "oil flavor". Analyzing those experiments that showed the same phenomenon, {{it was noted that}} the samples which were dried with high temperature and tasted after large storage periods were indeed classified as having a bad off-flavor similar to "oil flavor". Assuming that the association of the high temperature and large storage period produces this kind of flavor to the coffee beverage, a new experiment was designed whose aim was to prove it. Two lots of coffee samples were prepared; the pulped cherries and the unpulped ones, hoth dried at the same temperature of 100 °C. (hot air temperature). After drying, the samples were stored under the same conditions as used for the previous experiments. The cup tests ware done in two ages (time) : the first one in October 1961 (after three months storage) and no "oil flavor" was observed; the second age, in July 1962 (after twelve months storage) showed that all samples presented the so-called "oil flavor".

40|$|Determinar o consumo de energia durante a secagem do café usando-se lenha e gás liquefeito de petróleo (GLP) como combustíveis em algumas propriedades, da região sul de Minas e avaliar as razões de possíveis variações existentes no custo entre produtores foi proposta deste trabalho. Vinte propriedades foram visitadas, mas apenas quatro selecionadas, com o objetivo de se padronizar a caracterização técnica e econômica da secagem; esta padronização incluiu: lavagem e separação do café, processamento separado do café bóia do verde-cereja, pré-secagem do café cereja em terreiro e complementação da secagem do café cereja em secador rotativo com capacidade de 15000 L, usando-se lenha ou GLP como combustíveis. Procedeu-se ao acompanhamento de três testes em duas propriedades usando-se GLP como combustível para aquecimento do ar na secagem e três testes em outras duas propriedades usando lenha, também como combustível. Os resultados obtidos conduziram às seguintes conclusões: as variações na temperatura do ar das secagens em que se usou lenha como combustível, foram maiores que as observadas nos testes nos quais foi empregado GLP; o consumo de GLP no queimador onde se usou chama intermitente, foi maior quando comparado com um queimador regulado para realizar uma queima constante do GLP; enfim, o consumo de combustível está fortemente relacionado ao manejo adotado durante a secagem. The main {{objective}} of this work {{was to determine the}} consumption of energy during the drying using firewood and petrol-liquefied-gas, as fuels in some farms, as well as, to evaluate the possible reasons of variation in the cost among different producers. Twenty properties were visited and four were selected. The selection was made aiming at standardizing the technical and economic characterization of drying process. The standardization process adopted was the following: washing and separation of the coffee; separation of coffee which floats from the green-cherry; previous <b>drying</b> of the <b>coffee</b> <b>cherry</b> in yard, and complementary <b>drying</b> of <b>cherry</b> <b>coffee</b> using rotary dryer with 15, 000 L capacity using firewood and petrol-liquefied-gas as fuels for heating the air. Six drying tests were accomplished using petrol liquefied gas and firewood. The analysis of the results leads to the following conclusions: the temperature variations of the air in the drying process that used firewood, as fuel were greater than those observed in the tests that used petrol-liquefied-gas. The consumption of petrol-liquefied-gas in the burner that used intermittent flame was greater when compared with a regulated burner to accomplish a constant heating.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Faced {{with the}} {{importance}} of the drying in the post-harvest phase of coffee and its influence in the final quality of the product, the current study had the aim of evaluating the kinetics of the drying in different temperatures of the drying air for a low temperature at dew point of fruits of arabic <b>coffee</b> (Coffea arabica) <b>dry</b> processed. The cherries were manually picked and submitted to hydraulic separation. After that, the fruits with initial water contents of 1. 9 ± 0. 1 kg. kg- 1 (bs) were submitted to the drying process under three temperatures of dry bulb (35 °C, 40 °C e 45 °C) for the same temperature of dew point (2. 6 °C) of the drying air.

The elevation of the temperature of the dried bulb under the low temperature of dew point causes an increase of the effective diffusivity coefficient, the drying rate and reduces the time of drying. For the conditions which were studied, the effective diffusivity coefficient of water for coffee fruits varies between 1. 908 e 3. 721 x 10 - 11 m. s- 1.
