2500|$|Although {{the model}} run {{lasted more than}} a decade, the Peugeot 204 changed very little during that time: [...] very early saloons/berlines had a split rear bumper with numberplate set between the two halves, a flat rear panel and small oval tail lights. For 1975, the {{stainless}} steel front grill {{was replaced by a}} black plastic grill of the same overall shape. The <b>gearshaft</b> for RHD UK cars was moved from the steering column to the floor.|$|E
40|$|A {{calibration}} method for backlash compensation in cylinder worm gears is described which avoids {{the necessity of}} a direct insight into the gear box. The method is based on repeated measurements of the torsional backlash upon purposfully axial shifting of the <b>gearshaft.</b> It is demonstrated that any cylinder worm gear of ideal geometry can be calibrated using a backlash-maximum cirterium. From experimental investigations on gears of real geometry using a cone gear as well as a hypoid gear, a calibration algorithm has been derived. A robot-assisted tool for backlash-oriented calibration has been developed and integrated into an automated cylinder worm gear assembly unit.
