30|$|In summary, {{the fixed}} effects {{estimates}} {{show that the}} negative relationship between intermarriage and <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> return is spurious. Much {{of the difference in}} <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> return between migrants who marry a German and those who marry a non-German spouse is explained by selection into the respective marriage type. This is evidence against my hypothesis that intermarriage is associated with <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> return. Still, it does not in-and-of-itself refute that interactions with a spouse-to-be influencing <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> return, as many partners meet prior to marriage. Native spouses may therefore already have an effect on migrants’ <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> return during the courting stage or in the period of cohabitation 21.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} {{study was to identify}} variables within the physician-patient relationship that may have a relationship <b>to</b> patients' <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> adhere to medical recommendations. A literature review regarding the physician-patient relationship identifies two important variables: trust and empathy. This study investigated the impact of trust and empathy on patients' <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> adhere to medical recommendations. Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen, 1988) (Figure 1) was used as a theoretical cognitive framework to help conceptualize the proposed study. Trust and perceived empathy were proposed as variables in the physician-patient relationship that influence a patient's subjective norm, attitude toward the behavior, and perceived behavioral control sufficiently to affect the patient's <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> adhere to medical recommendations (Figure 2). The participants in this investigation included 128 adult Family Practice Clinic patients, who completed a set of questionnaires following an appointment with their physician. Participants completed the measures of the Perceived Empathy Scale (Plank, Minton, & Reid, 1996), the Trust in Physicians Scale (Anderson & Dedrick, 1990), and a short author generated measure of <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> follow medical recommendations. The survey included four demographic variables: sex, age, marital status, and number ofphysicians' appointments. A hierarchical regression was performed which indicated that trust in the physician was not a statistically significant predictor of <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> adhere to medical recommendations. However, patient perceived empathy from the physician was a statistically significant predictor of patients' <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> adhere to medical recommendations. The only statistically significant demographic predictor of <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> adhere to medical recommendations was marital status, indicating that participants who were married were more likely <b>to</b> express <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> follow medical recommendations that those who were not.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{aimed to}} examine the factors {{associated}} with <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> leave among newly graduated nurses (NGNs), using a longitudinal design. We distributed self-administered questionnaires (to be returned anonymously) to all the NGNs (n= 567) in nine advanced treatment hospitals in Japan on two separate occasions (Time 1 and Time 2, which were approximately 6 months apart). The questionnaire items addressed individual attributes, employment and organizational characteristics, and subjective health, and also included the 22 -item Job Content Questionnaire, a scale of <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> leave, and a novel 21 -item job readiness scale. The data from 301 NGNs {{who had participated in}} both questionnaire instances was used, and a hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted to investigate the factors associated with <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> leave. The results showed that while psychological distress was a more important predictor of <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> leave than was cumulative fatigue at Time 1, cumulative fatigue was a more important predictor at Time 2. Among the job stressors, a lack of coworker support consistently led <b>to</b> increased <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> leave, while a lack of supervisor support had a greater impact on <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> leave at Time 1. “Being personally suited for nursing work”, {{which was one of the}} job-readiness subscales, was found to independently and consistently influence <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> leave.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the impact of stressors and offsetting satistiers, measured in this study with Stress Offset Score (SOS), on <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> quit and examine the mediating and moderating effects of three facets of work satisfaction (job satisfaction, pay satisfaction, and satisfaction with supervisor) and two facets of organizational commitment (affective and nonnative commitment) on this relationship. The sample was composed of 2990 employees from 21 public and private organizations. The interaction of each type of work satisfaction and organizational commitment, with SOS, was tested using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) procedures. <b>Intentions</b> <b>to</b> quit was the dependent variable. The research questions were determine: (1) Does SOS predict <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> quit? (2) Does work satisfaction mediate the predictive relationship of SOS on <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> quit? (3) Does organizational commitment mediate the predictive relationship of SOS on intent to quit? (4) Does work satisfaction moderate the predictive relationship of SOS on <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> quit? and (5) Does organizational commitment moderate the predictive relationship of SOS on <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> quit? The results indicated that SOS was negatively correlated with <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> quit. Each of the types of work satisfaction and organizational commitment variables showed a partial mediated relationship with SOS and each relationship was highly significant, while normative commitment explained more of the relationship then other mediators. The study also tested for interactions but no statistical significant relationships where established between any of the interaction terms (e. g., SOSxJob Satisfaction and SOSxAffcctive Commitment) and <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> quit...|$|R
30|$|While <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> return are {{generally}} higher among married migrants than singles, migrants who marry a native spouse {{not only are}} less likely to intend to return than those who marry a non-native, but also less likely than singles. Male migrants who marry a native before migration have (0.098 – 0.143)[*]=[*]− 0.045 or 5 percentage points lower expected <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> return than singles (or 6 %).

40|$|Objectives: This article {{examines}} the <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> seek (preventive) psychological help among older persons. The study is carried out from the theory of planned behaviour and distinguishes attitudes (psychological openness), subjective norms (indifference to stigma), and perceived behavioural control (help-seeking propensity) in explaining behavioural <b>intentions</b> with regard <b>to</b> seeking preventive and therapeutic psychological help. Method: 167 Dutch adults between 65 and 75 years of age filled out a questionnaire measuring these concepts. Results: Older adults have low <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> seek professional help for psychological problems. Their <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> use preventive help are somewhat higher. Older adults are rather indifferent to stigma and they perceive control, but they are less open to professional help {{when it comes to}} their own person.

30|$|The {{coefficient}} of the variable German spouse in column 2 shows that when comparing intentions {{before and after}} marriage, there is a 4 percentage point larger decrease in <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> return among females who marry a native spouse than among those who marry a non-native. The effect is of the expected sign but relatively weak and not statistically significant. The negative coefficient for Married indicates that female migrants have lower <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> return when married than when single. Specifically, with marriage, female migrants experience a drop of 7 percentage points in <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> return. This effect is significant. For male migrants, the coefficient on <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> return indicates that men who marry a German spouse experience a 1 percentage point smaller decrease in <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> return after marriage than their counterparts who marry a non-German spouse. The coefficient is very small and insignificant (t[*]=[*] 0.169). Moreover, coefficients are imprecisely estimated due to small sample sizes. Therefore, it seems inadequate to attribute too much weight to this estimate. Table  4, furthermore, shows {{that the effect of}} marriage is strong and negative for male migrants. That is, <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> return decrease by 10 percentage points with marriage. This suggests that the fixed cost of return migration increases with marriage because of the increased household size.|$|R

30|$|It {{is clear}} that neither of the {{estimates}} holds up to the large difference in <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> return between intermarried migrants and those married to another migrant predicted by the OLS model. For the sub-sample of migrants who marry after entering Germany, the OLS results indicate a difference of 18 percentage points in <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> return between male migrants who marry a German and their counterparts who marry a non-German, while the fixed effects model estimates a difference of only 1 percentage point 19. For women, the expected {{difference between the two}} groups is as large as 25 percentage points according to the OLS estimates, versus the small difference of 4 percentage points provided by the fixed effects estimates. The effect of intermarriage obviously disappears when I control for unobserved variables. This suggests that much of the difference in <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> return between the two groups is due to selection, and the relationship between <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> return and intermarriage is spurious. This conclusion is also in line with the pattern observed in Figure  1. While migrants who marry a German spouse have much lower <b>intentions</b> <b>to</b> return than their counterparts who marry a non-German, the gap between the two groups is, roughly speaking, the same before and after marriage.
