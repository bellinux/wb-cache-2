5|$|In April 1996, after {{continued}} Hezbollah rocket {{attacks on}} Israeli civilians, the Israeli armed forces launched Operation <b>Grapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wrath,</b> which {{was intended to}} wipe out Hezbollah's base in southern Lebanon. Over 100 Lebanese refugees {{were killed by the}} shelling of a UN base at Qana, in what the Israeli military said was a mistake. Finally, following several days of negotiations, the two sides signed the <b>Grapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wrath</b> Understandings on 26 April 1996. A cease-fire was agreed upon between Israel and Hezbollah, which would be effective on 27 April 1996. Both sides agreed that civilians should not be targeted, which meant that Hezbollah would be allowed to continue its military activities against IDF forces inside Lebanon.|$|E

5|$|The best decade for January movies, Burr writes, {{may well}} have been the 1940s. It began with what he {{suggests}} was best January in cinema history. The <b>Grapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wrath,</b> His Girl Friday and The Shop Around the Corner, all considered classics, were released in January 1940. Later in the decade, other classic films would first reach screens during January, such as Sullivan's Travels, Shadow of a Doubt and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.|$|E

50|$|McBride had {{previously}} started a label, Noetix, {{and though it}} never quite got off the ground, he and Jowett were willing to give the record business another try. The company officially opened its doors in 1985. Their first release was The <b>Grapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wrath's</b> self-titled EP followed by their full-length, September Bowl of Green. It piqued the attention of Capitol Records, and not only {{paved the way for}} a distribution deal for the band but for Nettwerk as a label. Fueled by this and Skinny Puppy's success (and a little attention from Tipper Gore's negative campaigning), Nettwerk began to grow.|$|R
5|$|The {{story was}} {{inspired}} by Florey's own experiences in Hollywood, {{as well as the}} George Gershwin composition Rhapsody in Blue. It {{was one of the first}} films shot by Gregg Toland, who later received acclaim for his work on such films as The <b>Grapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wrath</b> (1939) and Citizen Kane (1941). The film serves as a satire of the social conditions, dominant practices, and ideologies of Hollywood, as well as the film industry's perceived mistreatment of actors. Douglas Fairbanks assisted with the development of the film, and Charlie Chaplin and Joseph M. Schenck helped promote it.|$|E
5|$|A specimen-collecting {{expedition}} {{along the}} Pacific Coast {{and down into}} Mexico provided them {{with a chance to}} relax, and, for Steinbeck, a chance for a brief escape from the controversy mounting around The <b>Grapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wrath.</b> Ricketts, suffering {{as a result of the}} breakup of his long-term relationship with a married woman in Monterey, was glad to get away too. They planned to collect specimens from the rock and tide pools and the shore line uncovered between tides which would allow them build up a picture of the macro level ecosystem in the Gulf. The preserved specimens of the fauna they collected could be identified and catalogued or sold on their return.|$|E

On 13 April 1996, during Operation <b>Grapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wrath,</b> an Apache fired two Hellfire {{missiles at}} an ambulance in Lebanon, killing six civilians. During the al-Aqsa Intifada in the 2000s, AH-64s {{were used to}} kill senior Hamas figures, such as Ahmed Yassin, Abed al-Aziz Rantissi, and Adnan al-Ghoul. On 24 May 2001, a privately owned Lebanese-registered Cessna 152 flew 15 minutes down the coast over Israeli airspace, refused to identify and respond to contact and a warning shot before it was shot down by an IAF AH-64A. IAF Apaches played {{a prominent role in}} the 2006 Lebanon War, launching strikes into Lebanon targeting Hezbollah forces.|$|E
5000|$|A review {{from the}} National Post by Mark Medley {{identifies}} regional and genre biases in the book. “While any list of [...] "Top 100" [...] anything {{is sure to}} ignite some controversy, there are definitely some glaring omissions from journalist Bob Mersereaus new book.” He lists 10 albums he considers to be amongst these glaring omissions. Four of these albums are from British Columbia artists. One of these was The New Pornographers’ Mass Romantic. “To completely leave off Carl Newman, Neko Case et al. is plain wrong. Im grouping in Stars 2004 album Set Yourself on Fire in with this.” Medley also noted the omission of BC band The <b>Grapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wraths</b> album Now and Again. “This album cracked the top 50 in Chart Magazines 1996 and 2000 top 50 Canadian albums polls.” He also notes the under representation of hip hop artists, and lists Maestro Fresh Wes’ Symphony in Effect and Dream Warriors And Now the Legacy Begins as two of his omissions.|$|R

In this piece of work I would like to comment some of the films based on these topics, {{emphasizing}} the didactic chances to be taught in academic activities. The films I have chosen are the following: The great dictator (1940), The <b>grapes</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wrath</b> (1940), Inherit theWind (1960), Spartacus (1960), Companys, judgement in Catalonia (1979), Gandhi, (1983), Guilty by suspiction (1991), Beyond Rangoon, (1995), Salvador Allende (2004) and Goodbye Bafana (2007).
