40|$|As {{the result}} of the rapid development, {{mountain}} areas have suffered from the unbalanced development and land use planning. Recently, under the global climate change, the stability of mountain land is more difficult to control. Therefore, it is an important issue to find the most suitable land use pattern for mountains in order to respond to the impact of global climate change. This paper applies multi-objective programming model for the evaluation of sustainable management strategies of optimal land development in mountains. The environmental <b>goals</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the water quality, the economic <b>goals</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the total output value, and the disaster <b>goals</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> soil erosion.

40|$|Two {{prominent}} {{theories of}} lifespan development, socioemotional selectivity theory and selection, optimization, and compensation theory, make similar predictions {{for differences in}} the goal representations of younger and older adults. Our purpose was to test whether the goals of younger and older adults differed in ways predicted by these two theories. Older adults and two groups of younger adults (college students and non-students) listed their current goals, which were then coded by independent raters. Observed age group differences in goals generally supported both theories. Specifically, when compared to younger adults, older adults reported more <b>goals</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> maintenance/loss prevention, the present, emotion-focus and generativity, and social selection, and less <b>goals</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> knowledge acquisition and the future.
