40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} simplified, but eective, {{algorithm}} to obtain critical design moments for clamped and/or elastically supported parking garage girders, beams and slabs. Maintaining the uniformly dis-tributed load concept, the equivalent <b>vehicle</b> <b>load</b> factors which can simulate <b>vehicle</b> <b>load</b> eects without conducting additional sophisticated numerical analyses for the concentrated loads are introduced. After determining a standard design vehicle of 2. 4 tons through {{an investigation of}} small to medium-sized vehicles made in Korea, finite element analyses for concentrated wheel loads were carried out by referring to the influence lines for the girders and beams and influence surfaces for the slabs. Based on the obtained member forces, we <b>determined</b> the equivalent <b>vehicle</b> <b>load</b> factors for the girders, beams and slabs which represent the ratios of member forces under <b>vehicle</b> <b>loads</b> to those under uniformly distributed loads. In addition, {{the relationships between the}} equivalent <b>vehicle</b> <b>load</b> factors and sectional dimensions were established by regression and used to obtain the design moments by <b>vehicle</b> <b>loads.</b> The member forces calculated by the proposed method are compared with the results of dierent approaches mentioned in current design codes with the objective of establishing the relative eciencies of the proposed method...|$|R
30|$|It {{should be}} noted that EEA [32] {{presents}} regression functions for three load factors: 0, 50, and 100  %. Because the effect of <b>vehicle</b> <b>loading</b> on CO <b>2</b> emissions is linear with load according to the ARTEMIS data, fuel consumption can be linearly interpolated between the relevant functions [36]. Furthermore, the functions used in this research come with a road slope of 0  % as no data were available for the road gradient. Once the fuel consumption of the transport operation is known, CO 2 emissions may be calculated by multiplying the fuel consumption FC with an emission conversion factor. DEFRA [37] proposes 3.1643  (g CO 2)/(g diesel), and it is this emission conversion factor that is used.|$|R

40|$|The most {{important}} factors on life cost analysis and serviceability of roads and bridges are the <b>vehicle</b> <b>loads</b> and traffic volume. The traffic effect {{is related to the}} vehicle types and the load carrying capacity. In general, many countries and cities have a standard legal axle load limit. In Colombia, the Minister of Transport is responsible for establishing the maximum load in highways. The country´s economic growth has improved during the last years. Therefore, most on-road vehicles have a total weight that exceeds the legal load limit. This additional load damages the pavement structure and reduces exponentially its life span. In order to establish maintenance strategies for the city´s road network, the local government is interested in <b>determining</b> the actual <b>vehicle</b> <b>loading.</b> Bogota´s road network represents 35 % of the total roads built in Colombia. Taking into consideration the length of paved roads in the city (around 16. 000 km), the first step towards a life cost analysis is to select an important and representative section of the city´s road network. This study aims to evaluate the reduction in flexible pavement life of an urban highway (Boyacá Avenue) in Bogotá, due to an increase of loads. Boyacá Avenue is a high-capacity urban road that crosses from north to south {{the west side of the}} city. This road is 35 km in length and was built entirely in flexible pavement. Damages on the pavement structure will determine the maintenance criteria and rehabilitation program to be implemented by the local government.

All light-duty vehicles were included in the analysis. The results indicate that during the 40 -year period examined, vehicle distance travelled increased by 155 %. However, because <b>vehicle</b> <b>load</b> decreased by 27 %, occupant distance travelled increased by only 84 %. Vehicle fuel economy (of the entire fleet of light-duty vehicles) improved by 40 %.

40|$|The cost of {{transporting}} a set of shipments from an origin to many destinations {{depends on}} the number of <b>vehicle</b> <b>loads</b> required and the average route length per load. This paper explores a trade-off between the dual objectives of minimizing these two factors. <b>Vehicle</b> <b>loads</b> and route length per load are evaluated for a heuristic whereby more than one vehicle is filled simultaneously for the same destination. Filling more than one vehicle {{at the same time in}} general allows more shipments to be fit onto each vehicle, but increases route length per load. The best balance between loading efficiency and route length per load depends on the square-root of the size of the region over which shipments are delivered and the average distance from the origin to the destinations. To minimize total route length, the number of <b>vehicles</b> <b>loaded</b> simultaneously should increase as the ratio between these two values decreases. ...|$|R

It is also found from the studies that the areas affected by soil deformation can be classified into four zones: the key disturbed zone, the secondary disturbed zone, the general disturbed zone, and minor-disturbed zone. The maximum soil deformation occurs on side of the longitudinal medial axis of the tunnel. The shape of the settlement curve is almost {{the same as that of}} the normal distribution curve.

40|$|International audienceIt is {{well known}} that tires play an {{important}} role in the generation of rolling noise. For low frequencies, the circular ring model can describe in a simple way the tire dynamic behaviour. This model is based on the Euler Bernoulli beam theory and takes into account the prestress generated by the internal air pressure but is otherwise linear. However, nonlinear effects resulting from high internal pressure and <b>vehicle</b> <b>load</b> can be important. In particular, <b>vehicle</b> <b>load</b> generates contact forces and a non-circular geometry in stationary rolling conditions. This paper presents a nonlinear flexible ring model based on the Timoshenko beam theory. It is used to simulate the nonlinear static deformation of a tire resulting from the application of <b>vehicle</b> <b>load</b> and inflation pressure. It is also applied to study the effect of these two parameters on the dynamic behaviour of the tire around its nonlinear static state by computing normal modes and transfer functions.
