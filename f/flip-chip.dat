5000|$|Flip chip - The {{concept is}} similar to <b>flip-chip</b> in package {{configuration}} widely used in the silicon integrated circuit industry. Briefly speaking, the LED die is assembled {{face down on the}} sub-mount, which is usually silicon or ceramic, acting as the heat spreader and supporting substrate. The <b>flip-chip</b> joint can be eutectic, high-lead, lead-free solder or gold stub. The primary source of light comes from {{the back side of the}} LED chip, and there is usually a built-in reflective layer between the light emitter and the solder joints to reflect up the light which is emitted downward. Several companies have adopted <b>flip-chip</b> packages for their high-power LED, achieving bout 60% reduction in the thermal resistance of the LED while keeping its thermal reliability.|$|E
40|$|Self-alignment of {{soldered}} {{electronic components}} such as <b>flip-chips</b> (FC), {{ball grid arrays}} (BGA) and optoelectronic devices during solder reflow is important as it ensures good alignment between components and substrates. Two uncoupled analytical models are presented which provide estimates of the dynamic time scales of both the chip and the solder in the self-alignment process. These predicted time scales {{can be used to}} decide whether a coupled dynamic analysis is required for the analysis of the chip motion. In this paper, we will show that for <b>flip-chips,</b> the alignment dynamics can be described accurately only when the chip motion is coupled with the solder motion because the two have similar time-scale values. To study this coupled phenomenon, a dynamic modeling method has been developed. The modeling results show that the uncoupled and coupled calculations result in significantly different predictions. The calculations based on the coupled model predict much faster rates of alignment than those predicted using the uncoupled approach...|$|R
