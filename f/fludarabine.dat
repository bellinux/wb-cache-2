25|$|T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia is {{difficult}} to treat, {{and it does not}} respond to most available chemotherapeutic drugs. Many different treatments have been attempted, with limited success in certain patients: purine analogues (pentostatin, <b>fludarabine,</b> cladribine), chlorambucil, and various forms of combination chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone CHOP, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone , vincristine, doxorubicin, prednisone, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, bleomycin VAPEC-B). Alemtuzumab (Campath), a monoclonal antibody that attacks white blood cells, has been used in treatment with greater success than previous options.|$|E
25|$|For {{most people}} with CLL, it is incurable by present {{treatment}}s, so treatment is directed towards suppressing the disease for many years, rather than totally and permanently eliminating it. The primary chemotherapeutic plan is combination chemotherapy with chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide, plus a corticosteroid such as prednisone or prednisolone. The use of a corticosteroid has the additional benefit of suppressing some related autoimmune diseases, such as immunohemolytic anemia or immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. In resistant cases, single-agent treatments with nucleoside drugs such as <b>fludarabine,</b> pentostatin, or cladribine may be successful. Younger and healthier patients may choose allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation {{in the hope of}} a permanent cure.|$|E
25|$|The anti-folates include {{methotrexate}} and pemetrexed. Methotrexate inhibits {{dihydrofolate reductase}} (DHFR), an enzyme that regenerates tetrahydrofolate from dihydrofolate. When the enzyme is inhibited by methotrexate, the cellular levels of folate coenzymes diminish. These {{are required for}} thymidylate and purine production, which are both essential for DNA synthesis and cell division. Pemetrexed is another anti-metabolite that affects purine and pyrimidine production, and therefore also inhibits DNA synthesis. It primarily inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase, but also has effects on DHFR, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. The fluoropyrimidines include fluorouracil and capecitabine. Fluorouracil is a nucleobase analogue that is metabolised in cells to form at least two active products; 5-fluourouridine monophosphate (FUMP) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate (fdUMP). FUMP becomes incorporated into RNA and fdUMP inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase; both of which lead to cell death. Capecitabine is a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil that is broken down in cells to produce the active drug. The deoxynucleoside analogues include cytarabine, gemcitabine, decitabine, azacitidine, <b>fludarabine,</b> nelarabine, cladribine, clofarabine, and pentostatin. The thiopurines include thioguanine and mercaptopurine.|$|E
50|$|Although the purine {{analogue}} <b>fludarabine</b> {{was shown}} to give superior response rates to chlorambucil as primary therapy, no evidence shows early use of <b>fludarabine</b> improves overall survival, and some clinicians prefer to reserve <b>fludarabine</b> for relapsed disease.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fludarabine</b> is {{associated}} with profound lymphopenia, and as a consequence, {{increases the risk of}} opportunistic infections significantly. Patients who have been treated with <b>fludarabine</b> will usually be asked to take co-trimoxazole or to use monthly nebulised pentamidine to prevent Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. The profound lymphopenia caused by <b>fludarabine</b> renders patients susceptible to transfusion-associated graft versus host disease, an oftentimes fatal complication of blood transfusion. For this reason, all patients who have ever received <b>fludarabine</b> should only be given irradiated blood components.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fludarabine</b> is a purine analog, and can {{be given}} both orally and intravenously. <b>Fludarabine</b> {{inhibits}} DNA synthesis by interfering with ribonucleotide reductase and DNA polymerase. It is active against both dividing and resting cells. Being phosphorylated, <b>fludarabine</b> is ionized at physiologic pH and is effectually trapped in blood. This provides some level of specificity for blood cells, both cancerous and healthy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fludarabine</b> {{is highly}} {{effective}} {{in the treatment of}} chronic lymphocytic leukemia, producing higher response rates than alkylating agents such as chlorambucil alone.Fludarabine is used in various combinations with cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, dexamethasone and rituximab in the treatment of indolent non-Hodgkins lymphomas. As part of the FLAG regimen, <b>fludarabine</b> is used together with cytarabine and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia. Because of its immunosuppressive effects, <b>fludarabine</b> is also used in some conditioning regimens prior to allogeneic stem cell transplant.|$|E
50|$|It is {{generally}} used as its phosphate salt known as <b>fludarabine</b> phosphate.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Fludarabine</b> was {{produced}} by John Montgomery and Kathleen Hewson of the Southern Research Institute in 1968. [...] Their previous work involved 2-fluoroadenosine, which was unsafe for use in humans; the change to this arabinose analogue {{was inspired by the}} success of vidarabine.However, in June 2016 during a clinical trial of CAR T-cell therapy, two patients died due to swelling of the brain, which occurred after <b>fludarabine</b> was added to the pre-conditioning chemotherapy regimen.|$|E
5000|$|Clofarabine is a second-generation purine {{nucleoside}} analog designed to overcome biological limitations observed with ara-A and <b>fludarabine.</b> A 2´(S)-fluorine in clofarabine significantly increased {{the stability of}} the glycosidic bond in acidic solution and toward phosphorolytic cleavage as compared to <b>fludarabine.</b> [...] A chlorine substitution at the 2-position of the adenine base avoids production of a 2-fluoroadenine analog, a precursor to the toxic 2-fluoro-adenosine-5´-triphosphate and prevents deamination of the base as compared to ara-A.|$|E
50|$|This regimen is also {{sometimes}} {{used in some}} autoimmune disorders that are inherently sensitive to rituximab, <b>fludarabine</b> and mitoxantrone in monotherapies (e.g. multiple sclerosis).|$|E
50|$|Bendamustine {{has been}} used both as sole therapy and in {{combination}} with other agents including etoposide, <b>fludarabine,</b> mitoxantrone, methotrexate, prednisone, rituximab, vincristine and 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fludarabine</b> causes anemia, {{thrombocytopenia}} and neutropenia, requiring regular {{blood count}} monitoring. Some patients require blood and platelet transfusion, or G-CSF injections to boost neutrophil counts.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fludarabine</b> {{inhibits}} {{function of}} multiple DNA polymerases, DNA primase, and DNA ligase I, and is S phase-specific (since these enzymes are highly active during DNA replication).|$|E

50|$|The FCM or R-FCM regimen is also {{sometimes}} {{used in some}} autoimmune diseases that are inherently sensitive {{to the use of}} rituximab, <b>fludarabine,</b> mitoxantrone, and cyclophosphamide alone in monotherapies (e.g., in severe multiple sclerosis flares).|$|E
50|$|Alemtuzumab is {{indicated}} {{for the treatment}} of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) in patients who have been treated with alkylating agents and who have failed <b>fludarabine</b> therapy.

50|$|Prior to infusion, a lymphodepleting preparative regimen is undergone, {{typically}} 60 mg/kg cyclophosphamide for 2 {{days and}} 25 mg/m2 <b>fludarabine</b> administered for 5 days. This substantially increases infused cell persistence and the incidence {{and duration of}} clinical responses. Then cells and IL-2 at 720,000 IU/kg to tolerance are infused.|$|E
50|$|FLAG and FLAG-based regimens {{can also}} be used in cases of {{concomitant}} AML and either acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or lymphoma. Because <b>fludarabine</b> is highly active in lymphoid malignancies, these regimens can further be used when patients have biphenotypic AML, in which cells display properties of both myeloid and lymphoid cells.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fludarabine</b> {{is a drug}} {{normally}} used to treat hematological malignancies and acts as an immunosuppressant. It {{has been shown to}} significantly improve conditions in neuropathy patients, but {{because of the lack of}} studies it is not used regularly. There is also a danger of potential toxicity as the treatment takes a year to stabilize the patient.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} include nausea, diarrhea, fever, rash, {{shortness}} of breath, numbness, vision changes, and feeling tired. Severe side effects include brain dysfunction, low blood cell counts, and lung inflammation. Use in pregnancy will likely result in {{harm to the}} baby. <b>Fludarabine</b> is in the purine analog family of medications and works by interfering with the duplication of DNA.|$|E
50|$|Alemtuzumab {{is used as}} second-line {{therapy for}} CLL. It was {{approved}} by the US Food and Drug Administration for CLL patients who have been treated with alkylating agents and who have failed <b>fludarabine</b> therapy. It has been approved by Health Canada for the same indication, and additionally for CLL patients who have not had any previous therapies.|$|E
50|$|It is {{also used}} {{as part of a}} {{chemotherapeutic}} protocol in preparation for hematological stem cell transplantation, a type of bone marrow transplant, {{in order to reduce the}} white blood cell count in the recipient (patient). Use under this protocol, usually with <b>Fludarabine</b> and Melphalan, was coined by oncologists at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.|$|E
50|$|Various {{chemotherapy}} {{drugs have}} shown {{increased risk of}} cancer patients developing leukoencephalopathy. High doses of intravenous methotrexate, a necessary component of chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, is known to cause asymptomatic leukoencephalopathy in children.
