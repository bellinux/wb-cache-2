40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{counteract}} adverse consumer reaction to <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>foods,</b> the biotechnology industry has shifted attention to deriving and promoting foods that have been genetically modified to have benefits for the consumer. However, is it uncertain whether this strategic shift will be successful at changing consumer perception of biotechnology. To provide an initial investigation into the issue, we surveyed 270 Mississippi State students. Results suggest that these consumers were more accepting of corn chips that had been modified to increase shelf life as opposed to increasing farmer yields; however, willingness-to-pay premiums for these value-added corn chips were extremely small relative to corn ships that contained no <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> corn. Results also suggest students were more accepting of <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>foods</b> when sold by agribusinesses {{with high levels of}} brand equity or store loyalty.

Monsanto spent $8.1 million opposing the passage of Proposition 37, making it the largest donor against the initiative. The combined total spent by food industry advocacy groups on the campaign to defeat Proposition 37 was $45 million.

50|$|In 1994, the Flavr Savr {{became the}} first commercially grown <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>food</b> to be granted a license for human consumption. A second copy of the tomato gene {{polygalacturonase}} was inserted into the tomato genome in the antisense direction. The polygalacturonase enzyme degrades pectin, {{a component of the}} tomato cell wall, causing the fruit to soften. When the antisense gene is expressed it interferes with the production of the polygalacturonase enzyme, delaying the ripening process. The Flavr Savr failed to achieve commercial success and was withdrawn from the market in 1997. Similar technology, but using a truncated version of the polygalacturonase gene, was used to make a tomato paste.|$|E

S. market-GE cigarettes. Our results suggest consumers pay less for GE-labeled cigarettes when marketing information is absent. But, when presented with marketing information on the attributes of the cigarette, we find no evidence that consumers pay less for GE-labeled cigarettes. auctions, BDM mechanism, cigarettes, field experiment, <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>foods,</b> second-generation, C 91, Q 18,...|$|R

2500|$|Genetically {{modified}} foods, GM <b>foods</b> or <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>foods,</b> are foods {{produced from}} organisms {{that have had}} changes introduced into their DNA using the methods of genetic engineering as opposed to traditional cross breeding.

50|$|The StarLink corn recalls {{occurred}} {{in the autumn of}} 2000, when over 300 food products were found to contain a genetically modified corn that had not been approved for human consumption. It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food. The anti-GMO activist coalition <b>Genetically</b> <b>Engineered</b> <b>Food</b> Alert, which detected and first reported the contamination, was critical of the FDA for not doing its job. The recall of Taco Bell-branded taco shells, manufactured by Kraft Foods and sold in supermarkets, was the most publicized of the recalls. One settlement resulted in $60 million going to Taco Bell franchisees for lost sales due to the damage to the Taco Bell brand.|$|E

Finding a new {{audience}} {{as one of the first}} films to be available on VHS, the movie developed a cult following that led to three sequels, including Return of the Killer Tomatoes starring George Clooney. A cartoon show was aired on Fox 1990-1992 Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. The term [...] "killer tomato" [...] has often been used as shorthand for the fear of <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>food</b> and was used by the media extensively during the tomato salmonella outbreak in spring 2008.|$|E

5000|$|Recombinant {{chymosin}} [...] Found in rennet, chymosin is {{an enzyme}} required to manufacture cheese. It {{was the first}} <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>food</b> additive used commercially. Traditionally, processors obtained chymosin from rennet, a preparation derived from the fourth stomach of milk-fed calves. Scientists engineered a non-pathogenic strain (K-12) of E. coli bacteria for large-scale laboratory production of the enzyme. This microbiologically produced recombinant enzyme, identical structurally to the calf derived enzyme, costs less and is produced in abundant quantities. Today about 60% of U.S. hard cheese is made with genetically engineered chymosin. In 1990, FDA granted chymosin [...] "generally recognized as safe" [...] (GRAS) status based on data showing that the enzyme was safe.|$|E

50|$|The safety {{assessment}} of <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>food</b> products by regulatory bodies starts with {{an evaluation of}} whether or not the food is substantially equivalent to non-genetically engineered counterparts that are already deemed fit for human consumption. No reports of ill effects have been documented in the human population from genetically modified food. There is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, but that each GM food needs to be tested on a case-by-case basis before introduction. Nonetheless, members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe. The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation.|$|E

5000|$|Jeffrey M. Smith (born 1958) is an American {{consumer}} activist, self-published author, {{and former}} politician.

He has appeared twice on The Dr. Oz Show. Smith has worked with organic food marketers and alternative health product promoters to advocate against genetically modified food. Supporters identify Smith as an influential educator on the alleged risks associated with genetically modified foods, while others point out Smith's lack of scientific background or expertise in the field. In 1998, Smith ran unsuccessfully for Congress as a candidate for the Natural Law Party. As of 2010, Smith was the executive director and sole employee of the Institute for Responsible Technology; in 2012 paperwork to become a 501(c)3 was filed.|$|R

Similar sentiments were expressed by the Hawaii Crop Improvement Association, of which Monsanto is a member.|$|R
