5|$|In 1976, 22 African {{countries}} and Guyana boycotted the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, after their <b>demand</b> <b>to</b> have New Zealand excluded was not met. A New Zealand rugby team had toured South Africa, {{which had been}} banned from the Olympics since 1964 because of its apartheid politics. Rugby union not being an Olympic sport, the IOC declined to exclude New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) {{returns to}} Scranton, after quietly quitting {{a week ago}} to work {{full-time}} at Athlead, the sports marketing company that Jim founded. When the others spot him, they are upset that he left without saying goodbye and <b>demand</b> <b>to</b> {{spend some time with}} him {{in one way or another}} before he leaves for good.

5|$|Subsequently, in the {{recording}} studio, Sargent was most in <b>demand</b> <b>to</b> record English music, choral works and concertos. He recorded prolifically and worked with many orchestras, but made the most recordings (several dozen major pieces) with the BBC Symphony Orchestra (BBC), the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO), the New Symphony Orchestra of London, the Philharmonia Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO).|$|E
5|$|A Malay {{language}} remake titled Aku Tak Bodoh (the {{translation of}} {{the title of the}} first film) was made as a Malaysian co-production between Grand Brilliance, J Team Productions, AMC Sdn Bhd RAM Entertainment, and PMP Entertainment with Jack Neo as the executive producer and directed by his protege Boris Boo. According to Neo himself, there was already a <b>demand</b> <b>to</b> adapt the first film itself into Malay after people requested for a dubbed version of it, but it took 4 years for the plan to come into fruition. The film, starring Jalaluddin Hassan and Adibah Noor among others, was released on 14 April 2011 in Singaporean cinemas.|$|E

5|$|After he {{inadvertently}} {{discovers the}} presence of walkers in the Greene barn, Maggie (Lauren Cohan) begs Glenn (Steven Yeun) {{to keep it a}} secret. Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn) quickly notices Glenn's nervousness, and when he talks privately to Glenn, Glenn blurts out about the walkers as well as his knowledge that Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies) is pregnant. Dale confronts Hershel (Scott Wilson) about the walkers. Hershel believes they are still people, including his wife and stepson, and can be cured, and refuses to kill them after Dale explains the danger. Meanwhile, Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and Lori argue on what to do with Hershel's <b>demand</b> <b>to</b> leave the farm, now that Carl (Chandler Riggs) is healed.|$|E
5|$|After the hurricane, {{the labor}} force diminished and wages {{decreased}} by staggering amounts. In July 2005, 9,592 people applied for unemployment services and the payroll of metropolitan firms declined by 13.6% between July 2005 and July 2007, indicating an estimated loss of 70,000 jobs. The sectors most affected were service-related industries, fluctuating with the population. The only sector to truly thrive after landfall was construction, which was in high <b>demand</b> <b>to</b> make needed repairs and rebuild destroyed homes.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Trial by Jury, Gilbert and Sullivan were {{suddenly}} in <b>demand</b> <b>to</b> write more operas together. Over the next two years, Richard D'Oyly Carte and Carl Rosa were two of several theatrical managers who negotiated with the team but were unable to come to terms. Carte proposed a revival of Thespis for the 1875 Christmas season, which Gilbert and Sullivan would have revised, but {{he was unable to}} obtain financing for the project. In early 1876, Carte requested that Gilbert and Sullivan create another one-act opera on the theme of burglars, but this was never completed.|$|E

5|$|After the war, France and Paris {{supported}} Allied {{forces in}} the Black Sea in 1919 during the Southern Russia Intervention. Mutinies briefly broke out on both ships in April 1919, but collapsed when Vice-Admiral Jean-Françoise-Charles Amet agreed to meet their main <b>demand</b> <b>to</b> take the ships home. 26 crewmen were sentenced to prison terms upon her return, although they were commuted in 1922 {{as part of a}} bargain between Prime Minister Raymond Poincaré and the parties of the Left. On 26 August 1922, she struck an uncharted rock in Quiberon Bay and foundered four hours later. Of her crew of 900, only three were lost. She was not modernized before her loss.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its limited}} release, English-language copies of Panzer Dragoon Saga are rare and sell for high prices. It {{has not been}} re-released. In 2009, a {{spokesperson}} for the game-downloading service GameTap stated that GameTap had non-exclusive rights to distribute the game, but as Saturn emulation is difficult, there was not enough <b>demand</b> <b>to</b> make it a priority. In the same year, Futatsugi stated that Sega had lost the game's source code, which would make porting the game difficult.|$|E
5|$|Duration: For most goods, {{the longer}} a price change holds, {{the higher the}} {{elasticity}} is likely to be, {{as more and more}} consumers find they have the time and inclination to search for substitutes. When fuel prices increase suddenly, for instance, consumers may still fill up their empty tanks in the short run, but when prices remain high over several years, more consumers will reduce their demand for fuel by switching to carpooling or public transportation, investing in vehicles with greater fuel economy or taking other measures. This does not hold for consumer durables such as the cars themselves, however; eventually, it may become necessary for consumers to replace their present cars, so one would expect <b>demand</b> <b>to</b> be less elastic.|$|E

5|$|During the trial, {{it emerged}} that Dyer had worn gloves to avoid leaving {{fingerprints}} on {{the letters and}} used water to stick the stamps rather than licking them, {{but that he had}} made errors, such as leaving a copy of an extortion demand on a newsagent's photocopier, however, there is speculation that this was done so his letter would reach Tesco by a person other than himself. Although Dyer initially demanded only £200,000, Tesco would have lost an estimated £5million had they complied with Dyer's <b>demand</b> <b>to</b> place cards in every copy of the Bournemouth Echo.|$|E
5|$|Hampden Park {{has held}} four full rugby union {{international}} matches. The first was in 1906, when the Scottish Rugby Union chose {{to play their}} match against the touring South Africans at Hampden because no rugby ground could satisfy the <b>demand</b> <b>to</b> see the visitors. A crowd of over 30,000 saw Scotland win 6–0. The redeveloped Hampden served {{as one of the}} 1999 Rugby World Cup venues, over 90 years later. Scotland played Romania in a friendly match before the tournament and South Africa played Uruguay in a tournament pool match. The only rugby union international played at Hampden since then was in November 2004, between Scotland and Australia.|$|E

The track is also demanding that NASCAR develop objective standards for the awarding of their race events and damages of $200 million. In January 2008, the court dismissed the lawsuit, saying that the plaintiffs had failed to make their case. Kentucky Speedway says they will appeal the court's decision.|$|E
5|$|Librarians at Valley Library {{began using}} text {{messaging}} in March 2010 {{to communicate with}} some library patrons, and earlier started to loan out Amazon's Kindle reader. In April, the school started allowing students to use the library 24-hours-a-day from Sunday through Thursday to test whether there was enough <b>demand</b> <b>to</b> allow 24-hour access on a permanent basis.

5|$|On 13 November 1962, Tsarapkin {{indicated}} that the Soviet Union would accept a proposal drafted by US and Soviet experts involving automated test detection stations ("black boxes") and {{a limited number of}} on-site inspections. The two sides disagreed over the number of black boxes, however, as the US sought 12–20 such stations and the Soviet Union rejected any more than three. On 28 December 1962, Kennedy lowered the US <b>demand</b> <b>to</b> 8–10 stations. On 19 February 1963, the number was lowered further to seven, as Khrushchev continued to insist on no more than three. Kennedy was willing to reduce the number to six, though this was not clearly communicated to the Soviet Union. On 20 April 1963, Khrushchev withdrew support for three inspections entirely.|$|E
