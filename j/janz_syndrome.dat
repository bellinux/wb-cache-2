2500|$|Juvenile myoclonic {{epilepsy}} (JME), {{also known}} as <b>Janz</b> <b>syndrome,</b> is a fairly common form of idiopathic generalized epilepsy, representing 5-10% of all epilepsy cases. This disorder typically first manifests itself {{between the ages of}} 12 and 18 with brief episodes of involuntary muscle twitching occurring early in the morning. Most patients also have generalized seizures that affect the entire brain and many also have absence seizures. Genetic studies have demonstrated at least 6 loci for JME, 4 with known causative genes.|$|E
50|$|Also {{known as}} <b>Janz</b> <b>syndrome,</b> {{juvenile}} myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is a common form of epilepsy, accounting for ~10% of all cases and ~25% of cases of idiopathic generalized epilepsies. Many children with CAE go onto to develop JME. JME first presents {{between the ages of}} 12 and 18 with prominent myoclonic seizures. These seizures tend to occur early in the morning. Patients with JME may also have generalized tonic-clonic seizures and absence seizures. Linkage of this disorder has been shown to mutations in the genes GABRA1, CACNB4, CLCN2, GABRD2, EFHC1, and EFHC2.|$|E

Most patients also have generalized seizures that affect the entire brain and many also have absence seizures. Genetic studies have demonstrated at least 6 loci for JME, 4 with known causative genes. Most of these genes are ion channels with the one non-ion channel gene having been shown to affect ion channel currents.|$|E
40|$|Sudden {{unexpected}} {{death is}} a catastrophic complicationof human epilepsy with an incidence of 6. 3 – 9. 3 per 1000 person years in epilepsy patients entering surgery programs[1]. However, mechanisms and methods to prevent it arestill largely unknow n. A leading hypothesis suggests adysfunction of excitability that could underlie both epi-lepsy and cardiac arrhythmias, leading to death [1, 2]. Inrecent years, there has been increased interest in a possibleassociation between epilepsy channelopathies and cardiacarrhythmias. We report a patient with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy(JME or <b>Janz’s</b> <b>syndrome)</b> and a Brugada diagnostic ECGpattern revealed after a convulsive seizure. Genetic anal-ysis revealed a novel mutation in the PKP 2 gene, encodingplakophilin 2, a myocardial desmosomal protein, which hasbeen associated with cardiac arrhythmias [5]. This obser-vation provides further evidence for a possible linkbetween idiopathic epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmias andthe related possible implication for Sudden UnexpectedDeath in EPilepsy (SUDEP) pathophysiology...|$|R
40|$|Juvenile myoclonic {{epilepsy}} (JME) (<b>Janz</b> <b>syndrome)</b> {{is a form}} of idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) of adolescence, {{which is}} characterized by massive bilateral myoclonic seizures occurring predominantly in the arms on awakening from sleep. A Proposed Diagnostic Scheme for People with Epileptic Seizures and with Epilepsy (2001) refers JME to a group of IGE with a variable phenotype. JME {{is one of the most}} com- mon forms of epilepsy (7 % among all forms of epilepsy and 27 % among its all idiopathic forms). The authors describe the history of epilepsy, the specific features of the course of the disease, its clinical manifestations, the characteristic types of seizures, and approaches to diagnosis and therapy. They also proposed the results of their investigation, the aim of study were epidemiological pattern of JME and the specific features of its therapy and remission in the Volgograd Region. The investigation showed that 83 % of the patents with JME in the Volgograd Region could achieve remission with medical treatment, as shown by the EpiCenter. Valproates are the drugs of choice (remission was achieved in 92 %). The most common combination was levetiracetam and valproate (71 % remission). Complete clinical and electroencephalographic remission of JME was achieved in 41 % of cases, valproates therewith remain to have benefits too (58 % remission).   </div...|$|E
