40|$|The paper {{examines}} the theoretical contributions of two eminent {{representatives of the}} Italian Paretian School, namely Luigi Amoroso and Giulio La Volpe. Both contributed to the most ambitious project undertaken by the Paretian School, that is, dynamization of the <b>general</b> <b>economic</b> equilibrium. This research programme was grounded on two pillars. The first concerned the use of then sophisticated mathematical instruments, such as functional, differential equations, and the calculus of variations. The second pillar involved maintenance of a strict analogy with physics and mechanics. But whilst Amoroso mainly used a theory based on the past, La Volpe founded his proposal on the future. <b>general</b> <b>economic</b> equilibrium, economic dynamics, Pareto...|$|R

50|$|Max Weber's Wirtschaftsgeschichte (<b>General</b> <b>Economic</b> History in English) (1923) {{is a book}} of {{economic}} theory which was composed by his students from lecture notes and released three {{years after his death}} in 1920. In his <b>General</b> <b>Economic</b> History, Weber creates an institutional theory of the rise of capitalism in the west. Unlike in his earlier work, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, religion is given a minor role. The emphasis of the work lies instead on the place of the state and calculable law in allowing economic actors to predict exchange for gain.|$|R
