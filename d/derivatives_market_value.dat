Based on the work of Allayanis and Weston (2001) and Rossi (2008), three measures of the Tobins’ Q ratio were used as an approximation of a firm’s value. The model is regressed using three methodologies: pooled OLS, fixed effect model and random walk model. Furthermore, the reverse causality and the direct causality between the use of foreign currency <b>derivatives</b> and the <b>market</b> <b>value</b> of firms are tested. The empirical results suggest that there is no clear evidence that the use of foreign currency derivatives is associated with a firm’s <b>market</b> <b>value.</b> Concerning the pooled OLS regressions, the hypothesis that the use of foreign currency <b>derivatives</b> increases the <b>market</b> <b>value</b> of firms was accepted, but was statistically not significant. However, in the fixed effects and random walk regressions, we found negative but statistically significant results. Finally, evidence was found that the companies that start using foreign currency derivatives as well as those that stop using it, experience a higher <b>market</b> <b>value...</b>|$|R

Moreover, the market price of systematic default risk is one order of magnitude higher than the market price of other risk factors. In contrast to studies by Fama and French (1993, 1996) and Vassalou and Xing (2004), this paper uses a market-based measure of systematic default risk.

The questionnaire instrument used in this research is based upon the postal survey methodology of Bodnar et al. (1995). A glossary was attached to the questionnaire survey to enable consistency in defining terminology used. A direct comparison between US and UK findings was undertaken together with an analysis of results from other published surveys conducted in the last four years. We find broadly similar trends in the use of derivatives. The results of our research show that derivatives usage to hedge financial price risk is well established amongst larger UK companies. Our findings support the size effect phenomena reported in other empirical studies. The primary objective cited in using derivatives was to manage fluctuations in accounting earnings, a focus that is inconsistent with the theoretical view of paying attention to cash flow benefits of hedging. The predominant issues of concern to UK inancial directors are the lack of evaluation of risk of proposed derivative transactions and the level of transaction costs incurred. This contrasts with the greater concerns of credit risk and market risk raised by their US counterparts in Bodnar's study. A possible explanation for these concerns could be the impact of the currency crisis happening in Asia especially for firms that are exposed to the affected currencies. It also suggests a lower level of sophistication and liquidity in UK <b>derivatives</b> <b>market.</b> The <b>value</b> of developing a basis for benchmarking good management practice in the use of derivatives to manage financial price risk represents an important area of research.

Through the lenses of the paradigm based theory of innovation, the authors first recognize that technological asymmetries and gaps between firms and countries appear more as sticky features than as transitory stages of (automatic) adjustment processes, thus reassessing the appropriability ad disclosure function of patents. Then, the paper presents a taxonomy of contemporary markets for knowledge, flagging the existence of what we call <b>derivative</b> <b>markets</b> for knowledge. Patents become to a certain extent liquid because they loose the weight and the density of the technological component and they can easily circulate in the market without having necessarily to be entangled in any final artifact. Just as in <b>derivative</b> financial <b>markets,</b> the <b>value</b> of patents is a function of expectations regarding their uncertain potential future value. The paper concludes sketching the implications for development focusing on two major issues: i) how reassessing the role of IP through an evolutionary perspective affects behavioral microfoundations of innovative conducts and ii) how asymmetries in technological and production capacities between countries mould patenting behavior and participation and exclusion in the contemporary markets for knowledge. intellectual property rights, patents, appropriability, markets for knowledge, developing countries...|$|R

Underground petroleum reserves are also an inventory defined by exploration surveys and development drilling. Thus, observable market {{information can be}} used to value these reserves. Option - valuation models {{can be used to}} price reserves using observable markets, but are dependent on unexplained convenience yields revealed by the term structure of futures prices. The authors apply a general inventory pricing model to petroleum inventories and generate an empirical model of the returns to storage for petroleum markets. They examine the determinants of the crude oil convenience yield using a stochastic control model. They specify optimal production and inventory conditions using a third-order cost function and estimate them using monthly observations. Their inventory arbitrage condition embodies the Hotelling principle and Kaldor's convenience yield, and includes a premium on the dispersion in crude oil prices. The empirical results suggest that returns to storage contain both a cost-reducing component and often sizable premiums associated with the dispersion of petroleum prices. Their findings suggest that crude oil markets differentiated by quality and location provide similar premiums. The premiums associated with the dispersion of petroleum prices may account for persistent backwardation in crude oil prices. This finding may also explain the wide discrepancies between Hotelling values and transaction prices found in previous studies.
