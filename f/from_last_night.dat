500|$|Writing about The Year of the Sex Olympics in 2003, Nancy Banks-Smith {{felt that}} Kneale {{was one of}} the few {{television}} writers whose work was particularly memorable. Once upon a time, Lord Hailsham, proceeding to the chamber of the House in black stockings and full-bottomed wig as Lord High Chancellor, spotted a friend and cried lustily, [...] "Neil!" [...] They say a whole party of American tourists fell to their knees. At the name of Kneale, I feel, every knee should bow. How much TV do you remember <b>from</b> <b>last</b> <b>night...</b> last year... last century? Quite. Curiously, I can remember clearly the first time I saw The Year of the Sex Olympics by Nigel Kneale. It was 35 years ago.|$|E
500|$|... "How About a Friendly Shrink?" [...] {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times {{praised the}} episode and was particularly {{excited by the}} guest appearance by Jane Leeves. She called the subplot between Gaby and Susan was [...] "cute, but honest", but felt the Orson and Katherine characters have [...] "run their course". Entertainment Weekly writer Tanner Stransky declared the reappearance of Katherine Mayfair was the only interesting element of the episode, {{and that it was}} touching to see her realize the damage she had done. Stransky wrote, [...] "The rest of the story lines <b>from</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> just kind of sat there rather limply," [...] and said the Orson and Bree story, and Tom and Lynette's therapy, [...] "just seemed so dumpy for this once-sexy show".|$|E
2500|$|The next morning, Piro {{has been}} brought to jail, {{where he has been}} interrogated by police about Miho's disappearance. He is able to leave jail by paying a suspiciously set low bail of about $100 US, which is {{obtained}} through a 10,000 yen bill that has been shaped into an origami 'zilla and left in the cell. [...] Piro walks back home, where he finds Miho sleeping on a beanbag in the apartment. [...] Piro and Miho then work out some of the confusion between them, which reveals several background events. [...] She explains the Analogue Support Facility as a sort of safehouse, where she was able to come and go when she wanted. Since Ping in her extreme attempt to find Miho had posted tons of pictures, videos, and information on the internet, people are now using that to [...] "build a 'real' me", as Miho explains it. During the process, at one point Kimiko calls from the studio, updating Piro on his artwork and telling him some of how last night she and others found Miho and how crazy it was. [...] Largo and Erika, who are riding on the roof of a train in the Miyagi prefecture also call during the conversation. [...] After a short conversation with both Largo and Erika on the phone, and a bit more conversation with Miho, Piro instructs her to stay in the apartment until they can figure out what to do. [...] Junko and Ping are shown leaving for school, with Junko seeming taking Ed's shotguns <b>from</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> with her.|$|E

60|$|It was half-past one. He {{looked at}} the silent kitchen, {{untouched}} <b>from</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> dim with the drawn blind. And he hastened to draw up the blind, so people should know they were not in bed any later. Well, {{it was his own}} house, it did not matter. Hastily he put wood in the grate and made a fire. He exulted in himself, like an adventurer on an undiscovered island. The fire blazed up, he put on the kettle. How happy he felt! How still and secluded the house was! There were only he and she in the world.|$|E
