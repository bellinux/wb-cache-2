50|$|The sketch {{illustrates}} the general {{structure of a}} rapid pressure sand filter. The filter sand takes up most space of the chamber. It sits either on a nozzle floor or {{on top of a}} drainage system which allows the filtered water to exit. The pre-treated raw water enters the <b>filter</b> <b>chamber</b> on the top, flows through the filter medium and the effluent drains through the drainage system in the lower part. Large process plants have also a system implemented to evenly distribute the raw water to the filter. In addition, a distribution system controlling the air flow is usually included. It allows a constant air and water distribution and prevents too high water flows in specific areas. A typical grain distribution exits due to the frequent backwashing.

This orifice is large and is covered by an operculum The entire structure is characteristic of the Aleyrodidae and within the family it is taxonomically diagnostic because it varies in shape according to the species.

Allgreen) plants were investigated with respect to root, shoot length, number of leaves plant- 1, leaf area and root and shoot biomass at a suburban site situated in dry tropical area of India, experiencing elevated levels of ambient air pollutants. Air monitoring data showed that mean concentrations of SO 2 and NO 2 were higher during winter, whereas O 3 was the major air pollutant during summer. Plants grown in non <b>filtered</b> <b>chambers</b> showed stunted growth, reductions in biomass and yield and modification in biomass allocation pattern as compared to those grown in charcoal filtered air. Magnitudes of changes in various parameters were more in summer than winter season. Nutritional quality of palak was also negatively affected in non <b>filtered</b> <b>chambers</b> during winter {{but there was no}} significant change in nutritional quality during summer season. Biomass allocation pattern revealed that during summer photosynthate allocation to roots reduced with consequent increment in leaf weight ratio, which helped in sustaining nutritional quality of palak even after more yield reductions in NFCs as compared to FCs.

5000|$|Phloem sap, {{which has}} a higher {{concentration}} of sugars and nitrogen, is under positive pressure unlike the more dilute xylem sap. Most of the Sternorrhyncha {{and a number of}} Auchenorrhynchan groups feed on phloem. Phloem feeding is common in the Fulgoromorpha, most Cicadellidae and in the Heteroptera. The Typhlocybine Cicadellids specialize in feeding on non-vascular mesophyll tissue of leaves, which is more nutritious than the leaf epidermis. Most Heteroptera also feed on mesophyll tissue where {{they are more likely to}} encounter defensive secondary plant metabolites which often leads to the evolution of host specificity. Obligate xylem feeding is a special habit that is found in the Auchenorrhyncha among Cicadoidea, Cercopoidea and in Cicadelline Cicadellids. Some phloem feeders may take to xylem sap facultatively, especially when facing dehydration. Xylem feeders tend to be polyphagous; to overcome the negative pressure of xylem requires a special cibarial pump. Phloem feeding hemiptera typically have symbiotic micro-organisms in their gut that help to convert amino acids. Phloem feeders produce honeydew from their anus. A variety of organisms that feed on honeydew form symbiotic associations with phloem-feeders. Phloem sap is a sugary liquid low in amino acids, so insects have to process large quantities to meet their nutritional requirements. Xylem sap is even lower in amino acids and contains monosaccharides rather than sucrose, as well as organic acids and minerals. No digestion is required (except for the hydrolysis of sucrose) and 90% of the nutrients in the xylem sap can be utilised. Some phloem sap feeders selectively mix phloem and xylem sap to control the osmotic potential of the liquid consumed. A striking adaptation to a very dilute diet is found in many hemipterans: a <b>filter</b> <b>chamber,</b> a part of the gut looped back on itself as a countercurrent exchanger, which permits nutrients to be separated from excess water. The residue, mostly water with sugars and amino acids, is quickly excreted as sticky [...] "honey dew", notably from aphids but also from other Auchenorrhycha and Sternorrhyncha.|$|E

In the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, mass movement of water through opposing alimentary tract tissues within the <b>filter</b> <b>chamber</b> is likely facilitated by an aquaporin protein. B. tabaci aquaporin- 1 (BtAQP 1) possesses characteristic aquaporin topology and conserved pore-forming residues found in water-specific aquaporins.

The least efficient method of recovery resulted when using membrane filtration procedures, especially as the exposure period of the organisms to the stream environment increased. A 2 -h enrichment on a rich, nonselective medium before exposure to selective media improved the recovery of fecal coliforms with membrane filtration techniques.

40|$|Advanced {{integrated}} gasification {{combined cycle}} (IGCC) and pressurized fluidized bed combustion (PFBC) power system requires both hot gas desulfurization and particulate filtration to improve system thermal efficiency and overall performance. Therefore, effective high temperature ceramic filters are indispensable key component {{in both of}} the advanced IGCC and PFBC coal based power systems to perform hot gas cleanup work. To meet the environmental particulate emission requirements and improve thermal efficiency, ceramic filters are mainly utilized to cleanup the hot gas particulate to protect downstream heat exchanger and gas turbine components from fouling and corrosion. The mechanical integrity of ceramic filters and an efficient dust cake removal system are the key issues for hot gas cleanup systems. The filters must survive combined stresses due to mechanical, thermal, chemical and steam attack throughout normal operations (cold back pulse cleaning jets), unexpected excessive ash accumulation, and the start up and shut down conditions. To evaluate the design and performance of ceramic filters, different long term filter testing programs were conducted. To fulfill this purpose, two Advanced Particle Filter (APF) systems were complete at Tidd PFBC Demonstration Plant, in Brilliant, Ohio in late 1990 {{as part of the}} Department of Energy's (DOE) Clean Coal Technology Program. But the most undesirable thing ever happened was the sudden functional and physical failures of filters prior to its designed life time. In Tidd APF filter vessel, twenty eight (28) filters failed one time. Significant research effort has been carried out to find out the causes that led to the early failure of filters. In this work, the studies are emphasized on the possible failure causes analysis of rigid ceramic candle filters. The objectives of this program were to provide an systematic study on the characterization of filters, material laboratory analysis on filter micro-structure, the dust cake dislodging mechanism and possible causes led to failures of ceramic filters.

In Europe, this insect can reach high densities on a variety of economically important woody plants. These planthoppers feed by sucking phloem sap and produce copious amounts of honeydew because they lack a <b>filter</b> <b>chamber</b> and have a midgut cellular membrane which prevents the efficient uptake of sugars (Lucchi et al., 1999). Honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) collect honeydew produced by M. pruinosa and utilize it to manufacture honey (Lucchi, 1997). This honey is harvested by apiarists in Italy and southern France and marketed as ‘‘Meile di Melata di Metcalfa’’ (5 Metcalfa honey) (Lucchi, 2000). Field observations indicate that honeybees collect most of the honeydew in the early morning and at sunset (Barbattini et al., 1997). This restriction of honeybee activity to these times is likely due to the relative availability of honeydew and the fact that honeydew dries quickly during the heat of the day.

40|$|AbstractA common {{denominator}} of all neutron radiography (NRAD) facilities worldwide {{is that the}} perimeter of the experimental chamber of the facility is a radiation shielding structure which,in some cases, also includes flight tube and <b>filter</b> <b>chamber</b> structures. These chambers are normally both located on the beam port floor outside the biological shielding of the neutron source. The main function of the NRAD-shielding structure isto maintain a radiological safe working environment in the entire beam hall according to standards set by individual national radiological safety regulations. In addition, the shielding's integrity and capability should not allow, during NRAD operations, an increase in radiation levels in the beam port hall and thus negatively affectadjacent scientific facilities (e. g. neutron diffraction facilities). As a bonus, the shielding for the NRAD facility should also prevent radiation scattering towards the detector plane and doing so, thus increase thecapability of obtaining better quantitative results.

Methods: The exposure occurred in two open-top <b>chambers</b> (<b>filtered</b> and nonfiltered) placed 20 m from a street with heavy traffic in Sao Paulo, 24 hours/day for 8 months. There was a significant reduction of the levels of PM(2. 5) inside the <b>filtered</b> <b>chamber</b> (<b>filtered</b> = 2. 9 +/- 3. 0 mu g/m(3), nonfiltered = 16. 8 +/- 8. 3 mu g/m(3); P = 0. 001). At this exposure site, vehicular sources are the major components of PM(2. 5) (PM <= 2. 5 mu m). Exposure of the parental generation in the two chambers occurred from the 10 th to the 120 th days of life. After mating and birth of offspring, a crossover of mothers and pups occurred within the chambers, resulting in four groups of pups: nonexposed, prenatal, postnatal, and pre+postnatal. Offspring were killed at the age of 15 (n = 42) and 90 (n = 35) days; lungs were analyzed by morphometry for surface to volume ratio (as an estimator of alveolization). Pressure-volume curves were performed in the older groups, using a 20 -ml plethysmograph. Measurements and Main Results: Mice exposed to PM(2. 5) pre+postnatally presented a smaller surface to volume ratio when compared with nonexposed animals (P = 0. 036). The pre+postnatal group presented reduced inspiratory and expiratory volumes at higher levels of transpulmonary pressure (P = 0. 001). There were no differences among prenatal and postnatal exposure and nonexposed animals. Conclusions: Our data provide anatomical and functional support to the concept that chronic exposure to urban PM affects lung growth.

40|$|Millions {{of people}} {{worldwide}} {{are affected by}} anthropogenic air pollution derived from the combustion of fossil fuels. In this work, we tested the effects of fetal, lactation and post-weaning ambient air pollution exposure on total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations and on a downstream pathway element, the plasma cysteine (Cys) concentration. Two similar exposure <b>chambers</b> (polluted and <b>filtered</b> <b>chamber)</b> were located near an area with heavy traffic in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and male Swiss mice were housed there from the pre-natal period until 3 months of age. Groups during fetal, lactation and adult periods of exposure were apportioned, and tHcy and Cys plasma concentrations were assessed when the animals were 3 months old. In our study, both the tHcy and Cys concentrations were decreased in groups that spent their final stage of life in polluted chambers, suggesting recent alterations in tHcy and Cys concentrations due to air pollution exposure. The possible relationship of these data with cardiovascular dysfunction is still a matter of controversy in animals; nevertheless, epigenetic mechanisms emerge as a possible issue to consider {{in the investigation of}} the link between air pollution and Hcy measurement.
