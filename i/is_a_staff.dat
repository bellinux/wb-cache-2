2500|$|... "Bro. Cottrell {{is nearly}} eighty years of age, remembers the dark day of 1780, {{and has been}} a Sabbath-keeper more than thirty years. He was {{formerly}} united with the Seventh-Day Baptists; but on some points of doctrine has differed from that body. He rejected the doctrine of the trinity, also the doctrine of man's consciousness between death and the resurrection, and the punishment of the wicked in eternal consciousness. He believed that the wicked would be destroyed. Bro. Cottrell buried his wife not long since, who, it is said, was one of the excellent of the earth. Not long since, this aged pilgrim received a letter from friends in Wisconsin, purporting to be from M. Cottrell, his wife, who sleeps in Jesus. But he, believing that the dead know not anything, was prepared to reject at once the heresy that the spirits of the dead, knowing everything, come back and converse with the living. Thus truth <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>staff</b> in his old age. He has three sons in Mill Grove, who, with their families are Sabbath-keepers." [...] ] ...|$|E

6000|$|... 11. You see, for one thing, at once, {{how strong}} the fleur-de-lys leaf is, {{and that it}} is just twice as strong as a blade of grass, for it is the {{substance}} of the staff, with its sides flattened together, while the grass blade <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>staff</b> cut {163} open and flattened out. And you see that as a grass blade necessarily flaps down, the fleur-de-lys leaf as necessarily curves up, owing to that inevitable bend in its back. And you see, with its keen edge, and long curve, and sharp point, how like a sword it is. The botanists would for once have given a really good and right name to the plants which have this kind of leaf, 'Ensatæ,' from the Latin 'ensis,' a sword; if only sata had been properly formed from sis. We can't let the rude Latin stand, but you may remember that the fleur-de-lys, which is the flower of chivalry, has a sword for its leaf, and a lily for its heart.|$|E
