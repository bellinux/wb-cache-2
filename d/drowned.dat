40|$|Background: The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) {{external}} codes (E codes) for <b>drowning</b> {{assist in}} determining the primary event leading to <b>drowning,</b> but do not alone allow the precise deter-mination of the overall <b>drowning</b> rates. Aims: To analyze {{the sensitivity of the}} ICD E codes for <b>drowning.</b> To describe the pattern and trend of <b>drowning</b> deaths that are classified with E codes other than for <b>drowning.</b> Setting: Finland, 1969 – 2000. Methods: Mortality files of Statistics Finland were searched electronically using the injury codes (I codes) and E codes for <b>drowning.</b> Cross analysis of I and E coded drownings was performed to determine the rate and pattern of <b>drowning</b> cases classified with E codes other than for <b>drowning.</b> Time trends were calculated using the Poisson regression model. Results: Of 13 705 <b>drowning</b> deaths, 644 (4. 7 %) were not identified with the E codes for <b>drowning.</b> The great majority (n= 547, 84. 9 %) of these cases were traffic accidents resulting in <b>drowning.</b> No sig-nificant time trends were found even after the introduction, in 1996, of the ICD 10 th revision. Conclusions: In Finland, underestimation of overall <b>drowning</b> rates using the E code alone is less pro-nounced than in countries where similar studies have been performed.

5|$|Nepenthes rajah is a {{carnivorous}} plant of the pitfall trap variety. It {{is famous for}} occasionally trapping vertebrates, even small mammals. There exist at least two records of <b>drowned</b> rats found in N. rajah pitchers. The first observation dates from 1862 and was made by Spenser St. John, who accompanied Hugh Low on two ascents of Mount Kinabalu. In 1988, Anthea Phillipps and Anthony Lamb confirmed the plausibility of this record when they managed to observe <b>drowned</b> rats in a large pitcher of N. rajah.

40|$|Introduction: The World Health Organization (WHO) {{estimates}} {{that there are}} at least 372, 000 deaths by <b>drowning</b> each year, making <b>drowning</b> the third leading cause of unintentional injury death worldwide. Despite its global impact, <b>drowning</b> remains a neglected public health issue and relatively under-researched area. Objective: (1) To conduct a comprehensive epidemiological investigation and address gaps in our understanding of the <b>drowning</b> problem at the global, national, and local level; and (2) to provide policy-makers and advocates with comprehensive information to inform their <b>drowning</b> prevention efforts. Methods: This study involved retrospective reviews of five data sources: (1) global <b>drowning</b> data were extracted from the WHO mortality database for all countries that reported deaths using ICD- 10 <b>drowning</b> codes; (2) data on non-fatal <b>drowning</b> victims who required hospital admission in Canada were obtained from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) s Discharge Abstract Database; (3) data on non-fatal <b>drowning</b> victims who required an emergency department visit were obtained from CIHIs National Ambulatory Care Reporting System; (4) data on unintentional fatal <b>drowning</b> deaths in Canada were obtained from the <b>Drowning</b> Prevention Research Centre (DPRC) database; (5) data on child <b>drowning</b> fatalities in private backyard pools in Ontario were collected from the case files at the Office of the Chief Coroner for Ontario using a structured questionnaire. Results: The results presented in this dissertation can inform <b>drowning</b> prevention globally, nationally, and locally. Internationally, official data categorization methods contribute to an underestimation of the burden of fatal <b>drowning.</b> In Canada, fatal <b>drowning</b> {{is only part of the}} problem; non-fatal <b>drowning</b> presents a substantial burden and the characteristics of non-fatal <b>drowning</b> differ significantly from fatal <b>drowning.</b> Further, although bystander intervention plays an important role in the survival of a <b>drowning</b> person, non-professional bystanders often intervene with high-risk, contact rescues, or do not attempt a rescue at all. Finally, children who <b>drown</b> in private backyard pools in Ontario often access the pool directly from the residence, yet most municipalities have not enacted isolation fencing bylaws. Conclusion: Addressing gaps in epidemiological <b>drowning</b> research at the global, national, and local level revealed several recommendations for policy, prevention, and future research...|$|R
40|$|<b>Drowning</b> is a {{major public}} health concern in low- and middle-income countries. In South Africa there is sound {{information}} and an emerging knowledge base for <b>drowning</b> prevention. However, there remains a scarcity of analyses of <b>drowning</b> in the country. The purpose of this analysis was to quantify the magnitude and describe occurrence of unintentional <b>drowning</b> deaths in five major South African cities, recorded between 2001 and 2005 by the National Injury Mortality Surveillance System. <b>Drowning</b> in South African cities occurred at rates of between 1. 4 and 2. 7 / 100, 000 population. The majority of <b>drowning</b> occurred among males, while the highest rates were observed among 0 – 4 year olds. Most <b>drowning</b> deaths occurred during recreational periods, over weekends and in the afternoon. Of adult <b>drowning</b> victims, 41. 5 % were alcohol-positive {{at the time of}} death. This study is based on one of only two known systematic sources of <b>drowning</b> mortality in Africa. It provides an indication of <b>drowning</b> rates in South African cities with young children and males at considerably more risk. The most likely locations for <b>drowning</b> varied from city to city. Among adult victims, especially men, alcohol is an important risk factor...|$|R
2500|$|Dry <b>drowning</b> is a {{term that}} has never had an {{accepted}} medical definition, and that is currently medically discredited. Following the 2002 World Congress on <b>Drowning</b> in Amsterdam, a consensus definition of <b>drowning</b> was established. Based on this definition, <b>drowning</b> is the [...] "process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid." [...] This definition resulted in only three legitimate <b>drowning</b> subsets: fatal <b>drowning,</b> non-fatal <b>drowning</b> with illness/injury, and non-fatal <b>drowning</b> without illness/injury. In response, major medical consensus organizations have adopted this definition worldwide and have officially discouraged any medical or publication {{use of the term}} [...] "dry drowning". Such organizations include the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, the Wilderness Medical Society, the American Heart Association, the Utstein Style system, the International Lifesaving Federation, [...] the International Conference on <b>Drowning,</b> Starfish Aquatics Institute, the American Red Cross, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the American College of Emergency Physicians.|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the issues}} that motivate the members of Lifeguards Without Borders to {{continue}} on their mission is the issue with the term “drowning.” <b>Drowning</b> has had several different definitions. There have also been different categories of <b>drowning,</b> including silent, wet and dry <b>drowning.</b> The 2002 World Congress of <b>Drowning,</b> the first conference of its kind, came to a consensus of the definition of <b>drowning</b> as, ”the process of experiencing respiratory impairment as the result of submersion/immersion in a liquid medium”. The <b>drowning</b> research conducted by Lifeguards Without Borders also concluded that <b>drowning</b> is the tenth leading cause of death for people of all ages in the United States and is the cause of 1% of deaths worldwide. The organization was able to educate people of the extensive research they conducted on <b>drowning</b> through an article published on www.jems.com, written by co-founder Justin Sempsrott. The article also includes other information relating to the history of <b>drowning.</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT - In the {{geological}} record a <b>drowning</b> process is documented by {{various types of}} shallow water-to-pelagic or shallow water to mixed benthic/pelagic carbonate transitions. <b>Drowning</b> unconformities are paraconformities, to disconformities, to angular unconformities, and their <b>drowning</b> surfaces range from planar to highly irregular morphologies. <b>Drowning</b> successions display a mix of products of both the benthic and pelagic carbonate factories. These successions can be also bounded by unconformities. <b>Drowning</b> unconformities and <b>drowning</b> successions are contrasted through a description and discussion of examples of escarpment-bounded platforms from the Jurassic of the Northern Apennines and, subordinately, from Sicily and other Tethyan sectors. The areal distribution of <b>drowning</b> unconformities and successions is discussed with reference to a complex depositional system whose architecture {{was the product of}} the riftinduced fragmentation of a regional Hettangian carbonate megabank. The examples in this study show <b>drowning</b> unconformities to be exclusive to intrabasinal highs, while <b>drowning</b> successions are found both on highs and in hangingwall basins. <b>Drowning</b> unconformities, with their long associated hiatuses, and <b>drowning</b> successions are often seen to merge laterally into one another over very short distances on the same intrabasinal high. The deposits of the <b>drowning</b> succession are sometimes missing {{on the top of the}} platform, while they are found forming clinoforms along its flanks, evidence that sediment could be permanently swept from the highs in these depositional systems at this stage...|$|R
