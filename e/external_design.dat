5|$|In June 2012 the museum's {{entrance}} was redesigned by Clash Architects with consulting engineers Price & Myers. Intended {{to act as}} a 'beacon' for the museum, the new <b>external</b> <b>design</b> {{included a}} faceted bronze entranceway, while the interior showed the cleaned and restored Portland stone walls of the Treasury building and Clive Steps. The design was described as 'appropriately martial and bulldog-like' and as 'a fusion of architecture and sculpture'.|$|E
5|$|Leicester's {{gatehouse}} {{was built}} {{on the north side of}} the base court, replacing an older gatehouse to provide a fashionable entrance from the direction of Coventry. The <b>external</b> <b>design,</b> with its symbolic towers and, originally, battlements, echoes a style popular a century or more before, closely resembling Kirby Muxloe and the Beauchamp gatehouse at Warwick Castle. By contrast the interior, with its contemporary wood panelling, is in the same, highly contemporary Elizabethan fashion of Leicester's building in the inner court. Leicester's gatehouse is one of the few parts of the castle to remain intact. The stables built by John Dudley in the 1550s also survive and lie along the east side of the base court. The stable block is a large building built mostly in stone, but with a timber-framed, decoratively panelled first storey designed in an anachronistic, vernacular style. Both buildings could have easily been seen from Leicester's building and were therefore on permanent display to visitors. Leciester's intent may have been to create a deliberately anachronistic view across the base court, echoing the older ideals of chivalry and romance alongside the more modern aspects of the redesign of the castle.|$|E
25|$|The {{youngest}} of the three Classical Greek orders, the Corinthian order came {{to be used for}} the <b>external</b> <b>design</b> of Greek temples quite late. After it had proved its adequacy, e.g. on a mausoleum of at modern-day Belevi (near Ephesos), it appears to have found increasing popularity in the 2nd half of the 3rd century BC. Early examples probably include the Serapeum of Alexandria and a temple at Hermopolis Magna, both erected by Ptolemaios III. A small temple of Athena Limnastis at Messene, definitely Corinthian, is only attested through drawings by early travellers and very scarce fragments. It probably dates to the late 3rd century BC.|$|E

25|$|The <b>external</b> <b>design</b> of the Class 87 {{was clearly}} derived {{from that of}} the Class 86; the only major detail {{differences}} were two front cab windows on the 87 instead of the three of the 86, and also the lack of headcode indicator boxes; by 1973, visual recognition of train reporting numbers by signallers was no longer necessary. The power and speed of the Class 87 was increased over that of the Class 86. Power output was increased to 5000hp to deal with the more demanding gradients on the northern half of the WCML such as Shap Fell and Beattock Summit, and the top speed was raised to 110mph (180km/h). The 87s were also fitted with multiple working equipment which enabled locomotives to work {{with other members of the}} class (and some Class 86s) while controlled by one driver.|$|E
500|$|This iPhone {{was named}} [...] "4S" [...] where [...] "S" [...] stood for Siri an iPhone 4S-exclusive {{intelligent}} personal assistant {{that was later}} included in future generations of mobile Apple products.

The 5S introduced the A7 64-bit dual-core system-on-chip, the first 64-bit processor to be used on a smartphone, accompanied by the M7 [...] "motion co-processor". A redesigned home button with Touch ID, a fingerprint recognition system {{which can be used}} to unlock the phone and authenticate App Store and iTunes Store purchases, was introduced. The camera was also updated with a larger aperture and a dual-LED flash optimized for different color temperatures.|$|E

500|$|Roddenberry {{was given}} {{complete}} creative {{control over the}} new television project by Paramount, which had promised him {{that it would be}} able to make the project a [...] "first-class effort" [...] with the budget to suit. Matt Jefferies, who had worked on The Original Series, was recruited as a technical advisor. He had designed the original USS Enterprise alongside Pato Guzman, but was unwilling to give up a position on the television series Little House on the Prairie for a 13-episode order on a new Star Trek series. Roddenberry was adamant that Jefferies was the right person to update the Enterprise, and agreed a position that the designer could advise the new show, but would have to choose between it and his main duties on Little House on the Prairie if the Star Trek work started to interfere. This occurred quite quickly, after Jefferies conducted design work on the new version of the Enterprise at a hotel in Tucson, Arizona while on a location shoot for Little House on the Prairie, and could not attend meetings with Roddenberry and the producers in Los Angeles. He recommended Joseph R. Jennings as the main art director on the series; Jennings had worked to Jefferies during the [...] and [...] seasons of The Original Series. Jefferies' re-design of the Enterprise was based on the principle that the technology was updated over time, but the general hull remained the same. He highlighted that the engines would specifically be designed to be replaced, so the <b>external</b> <b>design</b> of them was changed. Don Loos of Brick Price Movie Miniatures was hired to produce the physical model of the vessel, which was cast in moulds from fiberglass. Two models were built, a [...] version and a [...] version.|$|E

[...] "D" [...] or [...] "M" [...] {{refers to the}} cab - in most cases, Ulm-developed designs carried a D while <b>external</b> <b>designs</b> such as the Club of Four carry an M.

50|$|With the {{development}} of <b>external</b> bearing <b>designs,</b> the standard shell diameter has become a considerable constraint, limiting both {{the diameter of the}} bottom bracket spindle {{and the size of the}} actual bearing balls in the races. Consequently, these <b>external</b> bearing <b>designs</b> can be less durable than older internal bearing designs. To address this problem several designers have recently promoted proposed standards for a larger diameter bottom bracket shell, the best known of which is the BB30 standard promoted by Cannondale. The name BB30 refers to the 30mm diameter of the spindle, not of the shell.|$|R

2500|$|In February 1997 the FTO model {{range was}} given a {{facelift}} with a new front bumper arrangement, usually referred to by FTO enthusiasts as [...] "facelift" [...] models. The original two air intakes became one large single intake, blended into a full width forward-facing front splitter. The two supplementary fog and indicator paired units became four separate circular lights, each recessed into the new bumper. The headlamp internals were also changed to incorporate the vehicle's side lights, but their <b>external</b> <b>design</b> remained. An HID Option was also made available.|$|E
2500|$|The only <b>external</b> <b>design</b> {{alterations}} were minor detail changes. The bonnet was reshaped with a pressed bulge {{to allow}} the new, taller engine to fit in the engine bay whilst meeting pedestrian safety rules. This also avoided the need to re-design the engine sump to clear the axle. The new dashboard and ventilation system necessitated {{the removal of the}} distinctive air vent flaps underneath the windscreen which had been a feature of previous Land Rover utility models since the 1950s. While the flaps were deleted, the bulkhead pressing remained the same, so the outlines of where the flaps would be are still present. Passenger and Rear Loading doors were re-engineered to reduce corrosion and galvanic reaction. All other panels retained the same shape and styling that is viewed by enthusiasts as [...] "iconic".|$|E

60|$|Applied to {{the solar}} system, of which our own planet forms a {{component}} member, the evolutionary doctrine (in its elder shape) teaches us to envisage that minor group {{as the final}} result of a single great diffuse nebula, which once spread its faint and cloud-like mass with inconceivable tenuity, {{at least as far}} from its centre, now occupied by the sun's body, as the furthest point in the orbit of Neptune, the outermost of the yet known planets. From this remote and immense periphery it has gradually gathered itself in, growing denser and denser all the time, towards its common core, and has left behind, at irregular intervals, concentric rings or belts of nebulous matter, which, after rupturing at their weakest point, have hardened and concentrated round their own centre of gravity into Jupiter, Saturn, the Earth, or Venus. The main central body of all, retreating ever within as it dropped in its course the raw material of the planetary masses, has formed, at last, the sun, the great ruler and luminary of our system. Much as this primitive evolutionary concept of the development and history of the solar system has been modified and altered of late years by recent researches into the nature of comets and meteors and of the sun's surface, it still remains for all practical purposes of popular exposition the best and simplest mental picture of the general type of astronomical evolution. For the essential point which it impresses upon the mind is the idea of the planets in their several orbits and with their attendant satellites as due, not to <b>external</b> <b>design</b> and special creation, in the exact order in which we now see them, but to the slow and regular working out of preordained physical laws, in accordance with which they have each naturally assumed, by pure force of circumstances, their existing size, and weight, and orbit, and position.|$|E
