40|$|During {{the last}} decade, an {{increasing}} amount of pocket-size chemistry equipment {{based on the}} so-called 'lab-on-a-chip'approach has become available.

This paper discusses the development of a number of demonstrator chips and microsystems with applications in some of these fields. In particular, an integrated microsystem for flow injection analysis of ammonia in surface waters, a hydrodynamic chromatography chip for the analysis of particles and polymer molecules and a chip for ion analysis in blood are discussed in detail. The last chip may also find applications in environmental analysis...|$|R
2500|$|Haarmann was insistent {{that none}} of the skulls found in the Leine River had belonged to his victims, and that the <b>forensic</b> <b>identification</b> of the skull of Robert Witzel was mistaken, as he had almost {{invariably}} smashed his victims' skulls to pieces. The exceptions being those of his earliest victims—killed several years prior to his arrest—and that of his last victim, Erich de Vries. Although insistent {{that none of}} his murders had been premeditated, investigators discovered much circumstantial evidence suggesting that several murders had been planned hours or days in advance, and that Haarmann had both concocted explanations for his victims' disappearances and dissuaded acquaintances of his victims from filing missing persons' reports with Hanover police. Investigators also noted that Haarmann would only confess to murders for which there existed evidence against him; on one occasion, Haarmann had stated: [...] "There are some [...] you don't know about, but it's not those you think." ...|$|E
