5|$|Former British {{soldier and}} writer Ken Wharton {{published}} {{in his book}} Wasted Years, Wasted Lives, Volume 1, an alternative theory that was suggested to him by loyalist paramilitarism researcher Jeanne Griffin; this was that the ambush was planned by Robin Jackson as an elaborate means of eliminating trumpet player Brian McCoy. Griffin suggests that McCoy, who originally came from Caledon, County Tyrone and had strong UDR and Orange Order family connections, was possibly approached at some stage by Jackson {{with a view of}} securing his help in carrying out UVF attacks in the Irish Republic. When McCoy refused, Jackson then hatched his plan to murder McCoy and his bandmates in retaliation, even macabrely choosing Buskhill as the ambush site due to its similarity to Bus-kill. Griffin goes on to add that the bogus checkpoint was set up not only to plant the bomb on board the van but to ensure the presence of McCoy which would have been confirmed when he handed over his driver's license to the gunmen. She also thinks that <b>had</b> <b>everything</b> gone to plan once the bomb was planted in the van McCoy would have been instructed to drive through Newry where the bomb would have gone off and the UVF could then afterwards portray the Miami Showband as IRA members on a mission to blow up the local RUC barracks. Griffin based her theory on the nine bullets that were fired from a Luger into McCoy's body and that Jackson's fingerprints were found on the silencer used for a Luger. She furthermore opined that Jackson was the man Travers saw kicking McCoy's body {{to make sure he was}} dead.|$|E
25|$|One {{major factor}} was the neighborhood's {{high quality of}} life. Like most {{immigrant}} communities at the time, Ybor City <b>had</b> <b>everything</b> a recent arrival could need: work, shops, schools, churches, and most importantly, other immigrants who shared the language and customs of the old country. But unlike most U.S. immigrant enclaves of the period, Ybor City was no slum.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, European {{settlers}} {{came to the}} Pine City area, which was still heavily forested with thick stands of white pine, {{some of the largest}} in the state. When the railroad arrived in Pine City so began a logging expansion. Pine City prospered and grew into a city that <b>had</b> <b>everything</b> needed to serve residents, farmers, and the fast expanding lumber industry. Pine City was platted in 1869. The city was incorporated in 1881.|$|E

25|$|Tarsila do Amaral rata {{was born}} in Capivari, {{a small town in}} the {{countryside}} of the state of São Paulo. She was born to a wealthy family of farmers and landowners who grew coffee. At that time in Brazil, women were not encouraged to seek higher education, especially if they came from rich families and <b>had</b> <b>everything</b> they needed; despite coming from a well-to-do family, Tarsila had her family's support in obtaining higher education. As a teenager, Tarsila and her parents traveled to Spain, where Tarsila caught people's eyes by drawing and painting copies of the artwork she saw at her school's archives.|$|E
25|$|It was {{the best}} of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we <b>had</b> <b>everything</b> before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way – in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest {{authorities}} insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.|$|E
25|$|In March 1977, the Australian Cricket Board {{assembled}} 218 of {{the surviving}} 224 Australia-England players for a Test match to celebrate 100 years of Test cricket between the two nations. The match {{was the idea of}} former Australian bowler and MCC committee member Hans Ebeling who had been responsible for developing the cricket museum at the MCG. The match <b>had</b> <b>everything.</b> England’s Derek Randall scored 174, Australia’s Rod Marsh also got a century, Lillee took 11 wickets, and David Hookes, in his first test, smacked five fours in a row off England captain Tony Greig’s bowling. Rick McCosker who opened for Australia suffered a fractured jaw after being hit by a sharply rising delivery. He left the field but came back in the second innings with his head swathed in bandages. Australia won the match by 45 runs, exactly the same margin as the first Test in 1877.|$|E

25|$|This was {{the first}} World Twenty20, where 12 teams participated, divided into four groups of three, then two groups of four in quarter-finals; top two into semi-finals. Besides the 10 full members, Kenya and Scotland were the other two teams {{participating}} in this tournament that was played on three different grounds, Wanderers, Kingsmead and Newlands. The tournament was a huge success. It <b>had</b> <b>everything</b> required for top quality entertainment, including the world's best players and packed out stadiums. The tournament got underway with a stunning display of power hitting from Chris Gayle against South Africa. He clouted 117 off 57 balls, including 10 sixes. Shaun Pollock, Makhaya Ntini- nobody was spared. If this wasn't enough, Yuvraj Singh achieved cricketing nirvana by hitting England's Stuart Broad for six sixes in an over, during a barnstorming and unlikely 12-ball fifty. It wasn't entirely all batsmen-led action however, as Brett Lee claimed the first hat-trick in Twenty20 internationals, for Australia against Bangladesh. The breathless tournament culminated in a final that thrilled from start to finish, as India and Pakistan battled it out for the trophy. The match went down to a final-over thriller, with Pakistan needing six from the last four balls. But India eventually triumphed as Misbah-ul-Haq's attempted scoop off Joginder Singh landed {{in the hands of}} Sreesanth at short fine-leg. Mathew Hayden was the top run getter with 265 runs and Umar Gul took the most wickets, 13. Craig McMillan hit 13 sixes in the tournament, highest by any player.|$|E

Here he met Sidney Webb, a junior civil servant who, like Shaw, was busy educating himself. Despite difference of style and temperament, the two quickly recognised qualities in each other and developed a lifelong friendship. Shaw later reflected: [...] "You knew everything that I didn't know and I knew everything you didn't know... We <b>had</b> <b>everything</b> to learn from one another and brains enough to do it".|$|E

Johnny Giles said that [...] "he <b>had</b> <b>everything</b> – good close control, great {{dribbling}} ability and he was lightning quick. He was also an intelligent player, who knew how to pass the ball". Despite his great talents, he rarely tackled opponents and was not adept at heading the ball or using his left foot.|$|E
500|$|In exile {{after more}} than 30 years of coaching, Brown spent {{the next five years}} away from the sidelines, never once {{attending}} a Browns contest. While he was secure financially, Brown's frustration grew with each passing year. [...] "It was terrible", he later recalled. [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>everything</b> a man could want: leisure, enough money, a wonderful family. Yet with all that, I was eating my heart out." [...] Because Brown was still receiving his annual salary and liked to golf, it was said that the only two people who made more money playing golf were Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus.|$|E

[...] That 1925 bunch, which included Friedman and Oosterbaan, could run an end, buck a line, throw passes, kick, block, tackle, think, and do about everything needed on a football field to gain ground and keep other people from gaining ground. [...] Don't forget about that 1925 team that our opponents had a hard time making first downs, much less winning the game." ...|$|E
500|$|Promoted to the {{substantive}} rank of sergeant on 10 June 1941, Foskett {{was transferred to}} the RAF Headquarters, Middle East the following day. He spent two weeks with the headquarters, prior to moving on to No. 71 Operation Training Unit. In July, Foskett was posted to No.80 Squadron RAF, flying Hawker Hurricanes over North Africa. Commissioned as a pilot officer on 15 March 1942, Foskett was further promoted to acting flight lieutenant in July and appointed a flight commander of the squadron the following month. The commanding officer of No.80 Squadron, Donald Jack, later commented of Foskett during this time: [...] "the man, who was a born leader... <b>had</b> <b>everything</b> required; enthusiasm, aggression, humour, a zest for life and boundless energy".|$|E
500|$|On 3 October 1983 the {{friction}} between Boycott {{and the committee}} culminated in a unanimous decision not to offer Boycott a contract for the next season.

Bill Athey left the club at this time, and while Boycott in his biography maintained {{that he had no}} reason to believe that his actions had caused Athey's departure, Athey later stated to biographer Leo McKinstry that [...] "Boycott's attitude and the atmosphere he created <b>had</b> <b>everything</b> to do with my decision to leave Yorkshire."
