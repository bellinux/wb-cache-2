40|$|Due to {{functional}} requirement of a structural detail <b>brackets</b> with and <b>without</b> scallop are frequently used in bridges, decks, ships and offshore structure. Scallops {{are designed to}} serve as passage way for fluids, to reduce weld length and plate distortions. Moreover, scallops are used to avoid intersection {{of two or more}} welds for {{the fact that there is}} the presence of inventible inherent initial crack except for full penetrated weld and the formation of multi-axial stress state at the weld intersection. Welding all around the scallop corner increase the possibility of brittle fracture even for the case the bracket is not loaded by primary load. Avoiding of scallop will establish an initial crack in the corner if bracket is welded by fillet welds. If the two weld run pass had crossed, this would have given a 3 D residual stress situation. Therefore the presences and absence of scallop necessitates the 3 D FEA fatigue resistance of both types of brackets using effective notch stress approach (). FEMAP 10. 1 with NX NASTRAN was used for the 3 D FEA. The first and main objective of this research was to investigate and compare the fatigue resistance of <b>brackets</b> with and <b>without</b> scallop. The secondary goal was the fatigue design of scallops in case they cannot be avoided for some reason. The fatigue resistance for both types of brackets was determined based on approach using 1 mm fictitiously rounded radius based on IIW recommendation. Identical geometrical, boundary and loading conditions were used for the determination and comparison of fatigue resistance of both types of brackets using linear 3 D FEA. Moreover the size effect of bracket length was also studied using 2 D SHELL element FEA. In the case of brackets with scallop the flange plate weld toe at the corner of the scallop was found to exhibit the highest and made the flange plate weld toe critical for fatigue failure. Whereas weld root and weld toe at the weld intersections were the highly stressed location for <b>brackets</b> <b>without</b> scallop. Thus weld toe for brackets with scallop, and weld root and weld toe for <b>brackets</b> <b>without</b> scallop were found to be the critical area for fatigue failure. Employing identical parameters on both types of <b>brackets,</b> <b>brackets</b> <b>without</b> scallop had the highest except for full penetrated weld. Furthermore the fatigue resistance of <b>brackets</b> <b>without</b> scallop was highly affected by the lack of weld penetration length and it was found out that decreased as the weld penetration was increased. Despite the fact that the very presence of scallop reduces the stiffness and also same time induce stress concentration, based on the 3 D FEA it is worth concluding that using scallop provided better fatigue resistance when both types of brackets were fillet welded. However <b>brackets</b> <b>without</b> scallop had the highest fatigue resistance when full penetration weld was used. This thesis also showed that weld toe for brackets with scallop was the only highly stressed area unlike <b>brackets</b> <b>without</b> scallop in which both weld toe and weld root were the critical locations for fatigue failure when different types of boundary conditions were used. Weld throat thickness, plate thickness, scallop radius, lack of weld penetration length, boundary condition and weld quality affected the fatigue resistance of both types of brackets. And as a result, bracket design procedure, especially welding quality and post weld treatment techniques significantly affect the fatigue resistance of both type of brackets...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPurposeIn {{order to}} {{elucidate}} {{the characteristics of}} orthodontic appliance-associated dental plaque, this study aimed to profile the microflora and to estimate the acidogenic potential of supragingival plaque on first molars with orthodontic bands or <b>brackets</b> or <b>without</b> appliances. Material and methodsSupragingival plaque samples {{from the surface of}} upper and lower first molars with orthodontic bands or <b>brackets</b> or <b>without</b> appliances in 6 subjects (age, 11 – 30 years) were cultured anaerobically on blood agar plates. Isolated bacteria were identified by 16 S rRNA sequencing. The acidogenicity of isolated bacteria was examined using fastidious anaerobe agar plates containing bromocresol. ResultsBacterial growth (log CFU/mg) was 6. 6 ± 6. 5, 6. 9 ± 7. 1, and 7. 4 ± 7. 6 in samples obtained from molars with bands, <b>brackets,</b> and <b>without</b> appliances, respectively. Actinomyces (43. 5 and 40. 0 %) and Streptococcus (23. 5 and 34. 7 %) were the predominant species present on molars with orthodontic <b>brackets</b> and <b>without</b> appliances, respectively. In contrast, the proportion of Streptococcus (44. 4 %) was higher than that of Actinomyces (17. 6 %) on molars with orthodontic bands (P< 0. 01). The proportions of acidogenic bacteria in plaque samples from molars with bands, <b>brackets,</b> and <b>without</b> appliances were 74. 5 %, 71. 3 %, and 81. 6 %, respectively, although these differences were not statistically significant. Discussion and conclusionThese results indicate that there are differences in the microbial composition and acidogenic potential of supragingival plaque from first molars with bands, <b>brackets,</b> or <b>without</b> appliances, and suggest that supragingival plaque on teeth with brackets carries predominantly periodontitis-associated bacteria but less caries-associated bacteria...|$|R

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were: i) to analyze the {{reliability}} and validity of three tests that require sprinting (10 m, 25 m, 40 m), accelerations/decelerations (Stop and Go Test) and change of direction (Illinois Agility Test), with and <b>without</b> <b>ball,</b> in para-footballers with neurological impairments, and ii) to compare the performance in the tests when ball dribbling is required and to explore the practical implications for evidence-based classification in cerebral palsy (CP) -Football. Eighty-two international para-footballers (25. 2 ± 6. 8 years; 68. 7 ± 8. 3 kg; 175. 3 ± 7. 4 cm; 22. 5 ± 2. 7 kg·m- 2), classified according to the International Federation of Cerebral Palsy Football (IFCPF) Classification Rules (classes FT 5 -FT 8), participated in the study. A group of 31 players without CP was also included in the study as a control group. The para-footballers showed good reliability scores in all tests, with and <b>without</b> <b>ball</b> (ICC = 0. 53 - 0. 95, SEM = 2. 5 - 9. 8 %). Nevertheless, the inclusion of the ball influenced testing reproducibility. The low or moderate relationships shown among sprint, acceleration/deceleration and change of direction tests with and <b>without</b> <b>ball</b> also evidenced that they measure different capabilities. Significant differences and large effect sizes (0. 53 < ηp 2 < 0. 97; p < 0. 05) were found when para-footballers performed the tests with and <b>without</b> dribbling the <b>ball.</b> Players with moderate neurological impairments (i. e. FT 5, FT 6, and FT 7) had higher coefficients of variation in the trial requiring ball dribbling. For all the tests, we also obtained between-group (FT 5 -FT 8) statistical and large practical differences (ηp 2 = 0. 35 - 0. 62, large; p < 0. 01). The proposed sprint, acceleration/deceleration and change of direction tests with and <b>without</b> <b>ball</b> may be applicable for classification purposes, that is, evaluation of activity limitation from neurological impairments, or decision-making between current CP-Football classes...|$|R
