50|$|Sosa's fame acquainted {{him with}} sports cars as well. He had {{numerous}} accidents {{during the early}} 1960s, mostly {{as a result of}} speeding. He was {{behind the wheel of a}} DKW coupé when, in the early hours of November 25, 1964, he crashed into a roadside <b>hazard</b> <b>light</b> on Buenos Aires' Figueroa Alcorta Avenue, killing him at age 38.|$|E
50|$|The {{instrumentation}} are a cable-driven analog speedometer and tachometer with {{a stainless}} steel bezel, fuel low-level indicator, engine-trouble warning, turn signal, neutral, and high beam light indicators. The left-side handlebar controls include hazard, horn high and low beam control, flash-to-pass switch and turn indicator controls. The right side controls include the <b>hazard</b> <b>light</b> switch {{as well as the}} engine kill switch.|$|E

50|$|A very {{significant}} security {{problem with the}} Nova, was if one was to remove the <b>hazard</b> <b>light</b> switch, turn it upside down, and insert it back into its slot, they would find that the ignition would come on with no clear explanation. After a simple push start, the engine would start — effectively hot wiring the vehicle. This was demonstrated by Jeremy Clarkson in E01, S21 of Top Gear.|$|E
5000|$|... 1994: [...] Updates to the {{ignition}} timing due to {{adoption of the}} pent-roof combustion chamber design, the internal structure of the muffler, and {{the shape of the}} cam chain links for reduced mechanical noise. The engine mount location was updated for improved handling. A new instrument cluster appeared with the analogue fuel gauge moved to a central location from previously within the tachometer face, a row of indicator LEDs below the clocks, and a <b>hazard</b> <b>light</b> switch. Weight increased by 1 kg.|$|E
40|$|Flood is one {{of natural}} hazard that gives a {{significant}} impact {{to the environment and}} society. East Coast area of Malaysia in December 2014 was shocked by worst flood disaster history within 100 years. Flood occurred had resulted significant losses and threatening the population when more than 4. 82 million people across six states were sink flooded. In order {{to reduce the risk of}} flood disaster, appropriate plans and methods must be developed. In this case, the Geographic Information System (GIS) application can be used to assist in flood management in response to disaster vulnerability for risk reduction among society who living with flood. Pilot study was conducted in Kuala Krai district, Kelantan to determine an Emergency Evacuation Aid for flood preparedness management by using GIS. In this study, digital elevation model (DEM) data, GPS data, Flood Model data and land use data were used in the production of flood risk vulnerability map for the study area. On the map, location of evacuation centres which endorsed by Department of Society Welfare (JKM) were identified and plotted out. Analysis to determine vulnerability of each evacuation centres are being conducted based on five flood hazard level by JPBD standard. As a result, evacuation centres that located within green zone (very low hazard), yellowish green zone (low <b>hazard),</b> <b>light</b> brown (moderate), dark brown (high hazard) and red zone (very high hazard) can be pointed out. To reduce the risk, suggestion of mobilization options from high and moderate hazard area to evacuation centres located within five kilometres buffer radius from low hazard area are proposed. It is expected that this vulnerability map and evacuation aid plan will be able to assist the responsible parties to communicate and give an option to those affected people to ensure the effectiveness of the emergency response assistance and aid to victims for better preparedness capability...|$|E

50|$|European {{cars were}} popular as US gray-market imports: those {{vehicles}} {{were brought to}} the US some years after their original delivery in Europe. Early European imports had aftermarket <b>hazard</b> <b>lights</b> and Kangol seat belts fitted, US safety requirements that were adopted in Europe only in later production years.|$|R
50|$|Two minutes later, two street vendors, T-shirt seller Lance Orton, 56, and handbag seller Duane Jackson, 58 noticed smoke {{drifting}} from vents {{near the}} back seat of the unoccupied vehicle, which was parked with its engine running and its <b>hazard</b> <b>lights</b> on. They also heard firecrackers going off inside.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the system}} is not {{disarmed}} in the time window, it will warn the driver by sounding the vehicle's horn once every 10 seconds for 30 seconds, at which point the system will start sounding the horn at much shorter intervals and will usually activate the vehicle's <b>hazard</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R

5000|$|A [...] "strange but {{pleasant}} bit of South African driving etiquette" [...] involves [...] "pulling {{over onto}} the tarred hard shoulder {{to let the}} car behind overtake in safety". This is done regardless of whether there is traffic or not. The overtaker is expected to flick their <b>hazard</b> <b>lights</b> {{as a sign of}} saying thanks.|$|R
5000|$|At {{this point}} the {{immobiliser}} circuit will also start rapidly pulsing for 40 seconds, completely disabling the engine and eventually bringing the vehicle to a stop. If the thief switches the ignition to the off position {{and back to the}} on position again, the horn will restart and operate constantly and the <b>hazard</b> <b>lights</b> will flash for 60 seconds.|$|R
50|$|Witnesses {{recalled}} a Jaguar XJS (the {{type of car}} in which Penny Bell's body was later found) driving along Greenford Road at about 10:00 am very slowly with its <b>hazard</b> <b>lights</b> flashing. A witness came forward some time after the murder and claimed he saw her driving into the car park with a passenger, and silently mouthing an appeal for help, which he ignored.|$|R
5000|$|Flashing {{red lights}} are not {{generally}} allowed on vehicles, though many emergency vehicles have rear-facing flashing red lights, {{which are used}} to signify that the vehicle is stationary. These are, however, specifically prohibited by the Regulations. [...] <b>Hazard</b> <b>lights</b> may be wired to function at the same time, to make civilians further conscious of their presence. Fog lights may also be used in an alternating left/right pattern.|$|R
50|$|In parliament, MP Michael McNair-Wilson {{asked why}} the Thames Valley and Wiltshire police forces had not {{activated}} the motorway <b>hazard</b> <b>lights</b> to warn drivers of the patchy fog, but the under-secretary for transport, Christopher Chope, stated that these signs were only used for hazards not readily apparent to drivers and not for adverse weather conditions. The crash led to warning signals being introduced on British motorways to warn drivers of fog.|$|R
50|$|Two head-on airbags and (on higher trim levels) {{front side}} airbags are fitted as standard, with front window airbags {{available}} as an option. Electronic stability control (ESP), {{traction control system}} (ASR), anti-lock braking system (ABS), electronic brakeforce distribution (EBV) and brake assist (BAS) are all fitted as standard. If BAS is activated, the <b>hazard</b> <b>lights</b> flash to warn following motorists that the Viano driver is undertaking an emergency braking manoeuvre.|$|R
50|$|Lamps and reflectors: Front, side, {{and rear}} turn signals; brake lights, {{front and rear}} {{position}} <b>lights,</b> <b>hazard</b> warning <b>lights,</b> rear reflectors, low and high beam headlamps are all required. Sidemarker reflectors and lights and fog and driving lamps are permitted. All devices must function correctly and emit or reflect the required colours of light.|$|R
5000|$|As student {{transport}} is {{heavily dependent on}} the public transport system in urban areas, most students are transported on mass-transit or intercity buses along with minibuses in support. To distinguish themselves from other buses, routes that transport {{students are required to}} have a destination sign worded [...] with a yellow background. German traffic law gives traffic priority to school buses unloading and loading students; school buses are to warn traffic using their four-way <b>hazard</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R
25|$|The 1967 models saw a new semiconcave squared {{tail light}} {{design and the}} five-dial {{instrument}} cluster with a round speedometer at the very center. The best change for the year appeared {{in the form of}} the fully synchronized 150-T model three-speed manual transmission as standard equipment, meaning the end of non-synchromesh units in VAM cars. The new transmission was joined by a 3.73:1 rear differential gear ratio. <b>Hazard</b> <b>lights</b> were added to the standard equipment list.|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} {{design is}} still the same as the race car's design, but the spoiler has been slightly changed to meet road regulations. The interior, however has been extensively changed. The front dashboard and steering wheel have been simplified to meet regulations. The dashboard includes the usual lights featured on a dashboard. The steering wheel is manufactured by Toyota Team Europe. The center console has also been simplified, which now stores the climate controls, the air conditioning fans, <b>hazards,</b> <b>light</b> beam controls, etc.|$|R
50|$|More {{people die}} on the hard {{shoulder}} than on the highway itself. Without other vehicles passing a parked car, following drivers are unaware that the vehicle is parked, despite <b>hazard</b> <b>lights.</b> Truck drivers indicate that they are parked by putting their cab seat behind their truck. In the UK, the AA and police park their vehicles on the hard shoulder at a slight angle so that following drivers can see {{down the side of}} their vehicle and are therefore aware that they are stopped.|$|R

50|$|Lamborghini {{has also}} {{picked up some}} of the parent company Audi's design language. It is the first Lamborghini to {{incorporate}} daylight running lights into the headlamps. Seven light-emitting diodes (LEDs) at each headlamp flank the bi-xenon main beam and stay lit whenever the car is in movement. Due to the high temperatures in the rear lower part of the car, special heatproof LEDs are used for the indicator and <b>hazard</b> <b>lights,</b> stoplights and rear lights with a triple arrow optical effect.The Reventon's exterior created a basis for the company's current flagship Aventador.|$|R
40|$|This {{study used}} a video-based braking {{simulation}} dual task {{to carry out}} a preliminary evaluation of the effect of a sudden brake warning system (SBWS) in a leading passenger vehicle on the response time of the following driver. The primary task required the participants (N = 25, 16 females, full NZ license holders) to respond to sudden braking manoeuvres of a lead vehicle during day and night driving, wet and dry conditions and in rural and urban traffic, while concurrently performing a secondary tracking task using a computer mouse. The SBWS in the lead vehicle consisted of g-force controlled activation of the rear <b>hazard</b> <b>lights</b> (the rear indicators flashed), in addition to the standard brake lights. Overall, the results revealed that responses to the braking manoeuvres of the leading vehicles when the <b>hazard</b> <b>lights</b> were activated by the warning system were 0. 34 s (19 %) faster compared to the standard brake lights. The SBWS was particularly effective when the simulated braking scenario of the leading vehicle did not require an immediate and abrupt braking response. Given this, the SBWS may also be beneficial for allowing smoother deceleration, thus reducing fuel consumption. These preliminary findings justify a larger, more ecologically valid laboratory evaluation which may lead to a naturalistic study in order to test this new technology in ‘real world’ braking situations...|$|R
