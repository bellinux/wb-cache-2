50|$|According to the Constitution, {{there are}} three {{categories}} of courts: civil courts, penal courts and administrative courts. The {{supreme court of the}} civil and penal justice is the Court of Cassation, while {{the supreme court of the}} administrative justice is the Council of State. Hence, Greek judges belong to one of these two branches. Consequently, an administrative <b>judge</b> is not <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> a penal or civil case, while a civil <b>judge</b> is <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> a civil or penal case but not an administrative one.|$|R
50|$|Quite {{independently}} of any recommendation by the jury, the <b>judge</b> is <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> {{take into account}} matters proved during the trial, or laid before him/her after verdict, {{as a guide to}} determining the quantum of punishment.|$|R

50|$|He appealed {{against his}} {{conviction}} to the Court of Appeal, and the appeal was heard before Laws LJ, Curtis J and the Recorder of Cardiff.

5000|$|It {{is common}} to see in {{television}} or film portrayals of British courtrooms barristers addressing the judge as M'lud.

40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to clarify the dispute over {{judicial}} discretion by distinguishing the different senses in which claims about judicial discretion can be understood and by examining the arguments for these various interpretations. Three different levels of dispute need to be recognized. The first concerns whether judges actually do exercise discretion, the second involves whether <b>judges</b> are <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> exercise discretion, and the third is about the proper institutional role of judges. In this context, the views of Dworkin, Raz, Perry, Greenawalt, and Sartorius are examined. Finally, it is suggested that a resolution of the judicial discretion controversy requires a satisfactory theory of the justification of judicial decisions...|$|R

On 25 September 1621, he was appointed a judge of the Court of Common Pleas, and on 20 March 1622 was selected {{as a member of a}} commission to go to Ireland. He complained to Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex that the commissioners refused to recognise him as a <b>judge,</b> or <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> any precedence on the commission, and that he was placed junior on it. While in Ireland, upon the complaint of the general body of suitors, he revised the scale of costs in the Dublin courts. He remained a member of the Irish commission at any rate till November 1623.|$|R

5000|$|In the Courts of England and Wales, Judges of the High Court are called, for example, Mr Justice Crane (unless {{they are}} <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> be {{addressed}} as Lord Justice). Where a forename {{is necessary to}} avoid ambiguity it is always used, for example Mr Justice Robert Goff to distinguish from a predecessor Mr Justice Goff. The female equivalent is Mrs Justice Hallett, not Madam Justice Hallett. When more than one judge is sitting and one needs to be specific, one would refer to My Lord, Mr Justice Crane. High Court <b>Judges</b> are <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> be styled with the prefix The Honourable while holding office: e.g., the Honourable Mr Justice Robert Goff. In writing, {{such as in the}} law reports, the titles [...] "Mr Justice" [...] or [...] "Mrs Justice" [...] are both abbreviated to a [...] "J" [...] placed after the name. For example, Crane J would be substituted for Mr Justice Crane. [...] Female judges are still properly addressed [...] "My Lord", however [...] "My Lady" [...] is more modernly acceptable.|$|R
5000|$|The Court {{found that}} the trial judge was not bound by the Supreme Court's 1993 {{decision}} in Rodriguez v British Columbia (AG), instead holding that stare decisis is [...] "not a straitjacket that condemns the law to stasis". The Court expanded on their discussion of the issue in Canada (AG) v Bedford by ruling that trial judges may reconsider the decisions of higher courts {{if there is a}} new legal issue at bar, and if circumstances or evidence have [...] "fundamentally shifted the parameters of the debate". The Court {{found that the}} section 7 legal issues raised in the case at bar differed from those in Rodriguez, noting in particular the development of the overbreadth and gross disproportionality principles since 1993. The court also determined that the trial <b>judge</b> was <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> consider the different [...] "matrix of legislative and social facts" [...] that had arisen since Rodriguez.|$|R
50|$|The {{appeal was}} dismissed. The Court of Appeal {{held that the}} time to start {{measuring}} the immediacy of the apprehended violence {{is the time when}} the victim has the fear, {{that it would not be}} right to leave the case to the jury when the violence was anticipated at some time in the distant future and that it is not necessary for the victim to be able to see the potential perpetrator of the violence. In this case, as the victim had believed that the violence could occur at any time, the <b>judge</b> was <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> leave the question of whether or not the victim had a fear of immediate violence to the jury. The Court of Appeal also held that it is for the Crown (the Prosecution) to prove that fear was in the victim's mind and that it is irrelevant how it got there and that conduct accompanying words could make the words an assault. Therefore, the appellant had committed assault.|$|R
50|$|The Court of Appeal erred by {{interfering with}} the trial judge’s {{conclusion}} that the profits stemming from the soundtrack could not be dissociated from the profits derived from the infringing material. The soundtrack was only commercialized {{as a component of}} the television show Sucroë, which was itself created by copying a substantial part of Robinson’s work. The trial <b>judge</b> was <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> conclude that the soundtrack had no stand-alone value, and that it generated profits only as an accessory to the television show. Consequently, he did not make a reviewable error in concluding that it was inappropriate to apportion profits to the soundtrack as a non-infringing component of the work. However, solidarity of profits ordered disgorged under s. 35 of the Copyright Act cannot be inferred from , which makes co-authors of a fault solidarily liable for the “obligation to make reparation for injury caused to another”. In this respect, the Court of Appeal was correct.|$|R
50|$|The {{final two}} artists then sang their winner's {{song in the}} second round of the competition, with the 81-person {{professional}} judging panel and live audience voting for the winner. Every member of the professional <b>judging</b> panel was <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> one vote, and the total number of votes received by each artist were converted into percentage points based on the total voting strength, 81. Similarly, the public votes received from the live audience were also converted into percentage points based on the total number of the votes received by the final two artists. The artist who received the higher total average points was announced as the winner.|$|R
5000|$|The appeals were dismissed. The Court of Appeal {{reviewed}} New Zealand, Australian, English and Canadian jury {{directions on}} the standard of proof and held unanimously that the <b>Judge</b> had been <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> [...] "tell the jury that absolute or mathematical certainty was not required." [...] The Court also held that when people make important life decisions they often rely on [...] "elements of speculation, hope, prejudice, emotion", as such the [...] "everyday life analogy" [...] has the [...] "potential to puzzle jurors {{and for this reason}} is not helpful". [...] However the Court did not think the analogy [...] "caused any risk of a miscarriage of justice".|$|R

40|$|The Supreme Court in its 1971 {{decision}} of Younger v. Harris prohibited federal court intervention in pending state criminal proceedings {{in the absence}} of special circumstances. This Article examines the Younger doctrine from a modern perspective and argues for its abolition. The Article shows that abstention in cases seeking reform of state criminal justice systems is inconsistent with federal court activism in other areas. It argues that state <b>judges</b> are not <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> greater deference by federal courts than other state officials. It then explains why federal injunctive relief is essential to achieve systemic reform of state criminal justice. Finally, the Article offers specific guidelines for litigants and courts in the handling of criminal justice reform cases...|$|R
50|$|In a Cross Fighting, {{an artist}} {{would be sent}} {{by his or her}} coach to compete against an artist from the {{opposing}} team. The selection of the artists and their order of appearance were all decided by their respective coaches, and all of which were done without the knowledge of the opposing coach. Therefore, the pairings were completely by random, and would only be revealed when the coaches revealed their selection on stage. At the end of each Cross Fighting round, the artist receiving the most number of votes from the 51-person professional judging panel would advance to the next Playoff round. Each member of the <b>judging</b> panel was <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> one vote per pairing.|$|R
25|$|The {{pronouncement}} in Wong Kok Chin {{was followed}} in Ng Chee Tiong Tony v. Public Prosecutor (2008), where Justice Lee Seiu Kin {{set aside the}} conviction of the trial judge as he had descended into the arena of the trial and joined the fray. Although the trial <b>judge</b> was <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> seek clarifications, he had gone beyond that by encroaching into the Public Prosecutor's duty to bring out evidence to prove its case when he had asked the sole witness almost as many questions as the Public Prosecutor. Conversely, in Mohammed Ali bin Johari {{where one of the}} grounds of appeal against the appellant's conviction for murder was that the trial judge had engaged in excessive judicial interference, the Court of Appeal held that the trial judge had not descended into the arena as he had not interrupted (let alone cross-examined) counsel or the parties in such a manner as to give rise to prejudice or the appearance of prejudice to either party. Neither had it been suggested that the judge was guilty of any of these proscribed actions.|$|R

25|$|Consequently, {{the issue}} before {{us is not}} whether a State can execute the innocent.

50|$|The saisie-contrefaçon was {{introduced}} into French law by the Decree of 19-24 July 1793, {{which is the}} first general text concerning the rights of authors of intellectual works, {{for the protection of the}} right of reproduction (it was not applicable in the case of a violation of a performance right). At that time, only police commissioners and Justices of the Peace (the predecessors of instance court <b>judges)</b> were <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> carry out a saisie-contrefaçon. The saisie-contrefaçon was conceived more as a type of protective measure (and was characterised as such by previous laws) than as a probative measure. The saisie-contrefaçon therefore had a monitoring and even criminal and protective nature, certain traits of which have remained in practice (for example, deposit of the seized objects at the court clerk’s office). The remarkable effectiveness of the saisie-contrefaçon led to its progressive extension - recently through French Act No. 2007-1544 of 29 October 2007 - to all intellectual property rights, its criminal and protective nature correspondingly tending to diminish in favour of a probative nature. Today, the saisie-contrefaçon has an exclusively probative nature, except in the field of copyright and related rights where, for the historical reasons set out above, it has also retained its protective nature.|$|R
