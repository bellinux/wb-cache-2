5000|$|A voltage portal avoids voltage {{exposure}} for workers by extending the voltage source {{points to the}} outside of electrical enclosures. Each voltage point resides in an encapsulated non-conductive housing designed to insure that a NCVD senses voltage if placed into the voltage portal (Fig. 1). Because a voltage portal contains live voltage and mounts on the outside of an <b>electrical</b> <b>enclosure,</b> it must be robust to insure long term safety. The UL enclosure type rating of the voltage portal must also match the enclosure rating.|$|E
50|$|An <b>{{electrical}}</b> <b>enclosure</b> is {{a cabinet}} for electrical or electronic equipment to mount switches, knobs and displays {{and to prevent}} electrical shock to equipment users and protect the contents from the environment. The enclosure is {{the only part of}} the equipment which is seen by users; in many cases it is designed not only for its utilitarian requirements, but also to be pleasing to the eye. Regulations may dictate the features and performance of enclosures for electrical equipment in hazardous areas, such as petrochemical plants or coal mines. Electronic packaging may place many demands on an enclosure for heat dissipation, radio frequency interference and electrostatic discharge protection, as well as functional, esthetic and commercial constraints.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this task is to {{optimize}} the form and placement of a controller comprising the Grid Friendly™ appliance (GFA) controller, power supply and power relay (and/or a solid-state power electronic switch) that would command a domestic water heater to shed its load in response to stress on the electric power grid. The GFA controller would disconnect the water heater from its supply circuit whenever it senses a low voltage signal or other indicators of system stress communicated via the electric power distribution system. Power would be reconnected to the appliance when the GFA controller senses the absence of these signals. This project has also considered more frequent cycling of this controller’s relay switch to perform demand-side frequency regulation. The principal criteria considered in this optimization are reliability, cost and life expectancy of the GFA components. The alternative embodiments of the GFA equipment under consideration are: Option 1 - installation inside the insulation space of the water heater between the tank and jacket Option 2 containment in a separate nearby <b>electrical</b> <b>enclosure</b> Option 3 - as a modification or adjunct to the distribution panel housing and/or the breaker that protects the water heater supply circuit...|$|E
40|$|Plastic {{components}} are vital components of many engineered products, frequently representing 20 - 40 % {{of the product}} value. While injection molding {{is the most common}} process for economically producing complex designs in large quantities, a large initial monetary investment is required to develop appropriate tooling. Accordingly, injection molding may not be appropriate for applications that are not guaranteed to recoup the initial costs. In this paper, component cost and lead-time models are developed from industry data for an <b>electrical</b> <b>enclosure</b> consisting of two parts produced by a variety of low to medium volume manufacturing processes including fused deposition modeling, direct fabrication, and injection molding with used tooling, soft prototype tooling, and hard tooling. The viability of each process is compared with respect to the manufacturing cost and lead time for specific production quantities of one hundred, one thousand, and ten thousand. The results indicate that the average cost per enclosure assembly is highly sensitive to the production quantity, varying in range from $ 243 per enclosure for quantity one hundred to $ 0. 52 per enclosure for quantity ten thousand. The most appropriate process varies greatly with the desired production quantity and cost/lead time sensitivity. As such, a probabilistic analysis was utilized to evaluate the effect of uncertain demand and market delays, the result of which demonstrated the importance of maintaining supply chain flexibility by minimizing initial cost and lead time...|$|E

40|$|Kansei Engineering (KE) is a {{technique}} used to incorporate emotions in the product design process. Its basic purpose is discovering in which way some properties of a product convey certain emotions in its users. It is a quantitative method, and data is typically collected using questionnaires. Japanese researcher Mitsuo Nagamachi {{is the founder of}} Kansei Engineering. Products where KE has been successfully app lied include cars, phones, packaging, house appliances, clothes or websites, among others. Kansei Engineering studies typically follow a model with three main steps: (1) spanning the semantic space: defining the responses, those emotions that will be studi ed; (2) spanning the space of properties: deciding on the technical properties of the products that can be freely changed and that might affect the responses (factors in a DOE factorial design) and (3) the synthesis phase, where both spaces are linked (that is, how each factor affects each response is discovered). We claimed that KE {{is a good example of}} what Roger W.

40|$|PVC {{has a large}} sales volume, {{second only}} to polyethylene. Its high {{chlorine}} content provides it with {{a very high level}} of combustion resistance for building products, <b>electrical</b> <b>enclosures,</b> and wire & cable insulation. PVC has a unique ability to be compounded {{with a wide variety of}} additives, making it possible to produce materials in a range from flexible elastomers to rigid compounds, materials that are weatherable such as for siding and windows, compounds that have stiff melts and little elastic recovery for outstanding dimensional control useful in profile extrusion, or low viscosity melts which compete effectively with ABS and PC/ABS in thin walled injection molding parts such as computer monitor housings. Some of PVC’s properties are attributed to unique structures. The polymer precipitates from its monomer and grows into primary particles, which are later the melt flow units. Fusion into larger structures and product strength are controlled by break-down of the grains into primary particles, by the choice of additives, by the amount of melting (temperature), and by the number of tie molecules (molecular weight). The main type of polymerization is the suspension process, with significant polymerization made by the mass process and emulsion process. In the suspension process, the polymerization takes place in droplets of monomer suspended in a water. PVC is environmentally sound. With over 50 % chlorine content, chlorine makes PVC one of the most energy efficient polymers, makes PVC inherently flame retardant, and acts as a marker, enabling automated equipment to sort PVC containers from other plastics in the waste stream. Analysis from 155 large-scale, commercial incinerator facilities, found no relationship between the chlorine content of waste nor the addition of PVC, and dioxin emissions from combustion processes. New requirements from the U. S. EPA make scrubbers mandatory on all incinerators and are necessary whether or not PVC is present in the waste feed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} empirical {{results of}} cable noise reduction techniques {{as demonstrated in}} a TEM cell operating with radiated fields from 2 - 200 MHz. It is {{the first part of}} a two-paper series. This first paper discusses cable types and shield connections. In the second paper, the effects of load and source resistances and chassis connections are examined. For each topic, well established theories are compared to data from a real-world physical system. Finally, recommendations for minimizing cable susceptibility (and thus cable emissions) are presented. There are numerous papers and textbooks that present theoretical analyses of cable noise reduction techniques. However, empirical data is often targeted to low frequencies (e. g. 100 MHz). Additionally, a comprehensive study showing the relative effects of various noise reduction techniques is needed. These include the use of dedicated return wires, twisted wiring, cable shielding, shield connections, changing load or source impedances, and implementing load- or source-to-chassis isolation. We have created an experimental setup that emulates a real-world electrical system, while still allowing us to independently vary a host of parameters. The goal of the experiment was to determine the relative effectiveness of various noise reduction techniques when the cable is in the presence of radiated emissions from 2 MHz to 200 MHz. The electronic system (Fig. 1) consisted of two Hammond shielded <b>electrical</b> <b>enclosures,</b> one containing the source resistance, and the other containing the load resistance. The boxes were mounted on a large aluminium plate acting as the chassis. Cables connecting the two boxes measured 81 cm in length and were attached to the boxes using standard D 38999 military-style connectors. The test setup is shown in Fig. 2. Electromagnetic fields were created using an HP 8657 B signal generator, MiniCircuits ZHL- 42 W-SMA amplifier, and an EMCO 5103 TEM cell.
