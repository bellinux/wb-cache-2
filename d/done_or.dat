5|$|Beef steak can {{be cooked}} {{to a level}} of very rare (bleu, a cold raw center), rare, medium rare, medium, medium well <b>done,</b> <b>or</b> well done. Pittsburgh rare is charred on the outside. Beef, unlike certain other meats, {{does not need to be}} cooked through. Food-borne human {{illnesses}} are not normally found within a beef steak, though surfaces can potentially be contaminated from handling, and thus, very rare steak (seared on the outside and raw within) is generally accepted as safe.|$|E
5|$|Under the Act, it is a {{contempt}} of Parliament to perform certain acts, for instance, to insult the Speaker or any Member of Parliament (MP) coming to or going from Parliament {{on account of}} his or her conduct in Parliament or of anything <b>done</b> <b>or</b> said by him or her in Parliament; or to publish any statement, whether in writing or otherwise, which falsely or scandalously defames, or which reflects on the character of, the Speaker or any MP touching on his or her conduct in Parliament or anything <b>done</b> <b>or</b> said by him or her in Parliament. It is presumably not open to a person charged with one of these offences to argue that it violates the Article 14 right to freedom of speech and expression. However, there is not yet any case law addressing this provision, and thus little guidance as to how the courts are to interpret the restriction.|$|E

5|$|The {{era that}} began when Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon in 49 BC, and ended when Octavian {{returned}} to Rome after the Battle of Actium in 29 BC, {{can be divided}} into two distinct units. The dividing line between these two units is the assassination of Caesar in March 44 BC, although from a constitutional standpoint, there was no clear dividing line between these two periods. The forces which had supported Pompey during {{the early part of the}} first period were allied against Mark Antony and Octavian in 43 BC and 42 BC, and the constitutional means through which Caesar had held power before his assassination were used by Antony and Octavian to hold power after Caesar's assassination. From a constitutional standpoint, it makes no difference whether an autocrat holds the title of Roman Dictator, as Caesar had <b>done,</b> <b>or</b> of Triumvir, as Antony and Octavian had done. From a constitutional perspective, these twenty years formed a single unit, through which the constitutional evolution of the prior century accelerated at a rapid pace. By 27 BC, Rome had completed its transition from being a city-state with a network of dependencies, to being the capital of a world empire.|$|E

25|$|The many {{different}} terms for vows and pledges used in Kol Nidrei can be confusing, especially because the English language is poor in short equivalent terms that express the same nuances. These terms are almost exclusively religious pledges of various kinds: That something will be <b>done</b> (<b>or</b> not <b>done)</b> <b>or</b> given {{in exchange for}} a prayer being answered, that something will be <b>done</b> (<b>or</b> not done) for religious purposes or to show religious devotion, that a thing will be used only for religious purposes (e.g., as a tool used for building or repairing the Temple) and never for mundane purposes, that a thing will be given to the Temple or treated as if it were already given to the Temple, and so forth; and to make this declaration all the more clear, every possible synonym for such pledging and for nullification or cancellation of such pledges is used.|$|E
25|$|Buddhism, Hinduism and Christianity {{differ on}} {{fundamental}} beliefs on heaven, hell and reincarnation, {{to name a}} few.
