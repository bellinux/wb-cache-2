40|$|Almost every {{theory of}} vagueness shares {{at least one}} feature: it uses, {{and in most cases}} heavily relies on, some kind of {{normative}} predicate (or predicates) in its metalanguage. Metalinguistic normative predicates are discussed chiefly by supervaluationists and other defenders of higher-order vagueness. According to this group of theorists, the existence of higher-order vagueness depends on and is explained by the vagueness of predicates like “definitely x”. However, {{the question of how to}} characterize these predicates has wider interest. The vagueness of metalinguistic normative predicates may seem particularly worrisome to theorists who insist that the metalanguage used to describe a theory of vagueness be precise. In general, however, both for those who accept metalinguistic vagueness and for those who deny it, even in ordinary language normative predicates are difficult to classify. If they are not vague, what are they? If they are precise, how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> possibility of generating a sorites paradox with them? Is a different solution to the paradox necessary for this class of predicates? Normative predicates differ from standardly vague predicates such as tall and red in that their extensions are not arbitrary, that is, do not permit of multiple standards of application. A non-normatively vague predicate (tall, red) would not usually engender a heated debate about its application because its vagueness is widely recognized.

Seguindo a metodologia do Discurso do Sujeito Coletivo (DSC), partimos do depoimento de vinte e um docentes, com as seguintes questões abertas: 1 - Como você explica o fracasso escolar?; 2 - Como você percebe a saúde no ambiente escolar? 3 - Como você considera que os novos conhecimentos e conceitos científicos têm chegado à escola? Entrevistamos os professores em ambiente fora da escola, com seu consentimento livre e esclarecido, gravamos e transcrevemos suas falas e identificamos as expressões-chave, as idéias centrais e as ancoragens dos discursos. Compusemos então os seguintes DSC: (A) sobre fracasso escolar: dois DSCs, um com ancoragem em “A ausência da família contribui para o fracasso dos alunos na escola”; e outro em “O fracasso escolar representa o fracasso da sociedade de maneira geral”; (B) sobre a saúde na escola: dois DSCs, um com ancoragem em “a saúde na escola anda mal; famílias pobres não cuidam da saúde e higiene”; e outro em “os alunos não estão tendo acesso às redes de saúde; os alunos sentem fome na escola; apresentam muitos problemas básicos de saúde, assim como os professores; (C) sobre ciência e conhecimento: um DSC, um com ancoragem em: a ciência e o conhecimento chegam à escola de forma muito precária. Nossos resultados revelam uma apreensão dos professores sobre as dificuldades do processo de escolarização dos alunos, em sua maioria de origem pobre, caracterizada pela imputação do fracasso escolar às famílias desses alunos, à sociedade e ao Estado. As opiniões expressas nos discursos apresentaram-se basicamente de duas formas: por um lado, evidenciaram a existência de elementos de preconceitos, rótulos e crenças em relação as dificuldades de desempenho dos alunos e à sua condição de pobreza; por outro, apresentam criticas ao sistema escolar, às dificuldades de acesso dos alunos e suas famílias aos serviços básicos de saúde e também sobre as relações entre a academia e a escola. A pesquisa permite pensar a situação de fracasso escolar como fruto do próprio sistema escolar excludente que não cria condições para a realização plena de novas propostas educacionais que se alternam a cada troca de governo numa luta por uma nova legitimidade no campo educacional. We {{analyze the}} problem of failure in public schools {{municipal}} and health concepts, science and knowledge of teachers, {{as well as its}} impasses and difficulties in the realization of school work, from the study of three school units of subdivision of Penha, region of Leopoldina, Rio de Janeiro. Following the methodology of Collective subject Discourse (DSC), we have the testimony of twenty-one teachers, with the following open questions: 1 -How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> school failure?; 2 -how you perceive the health in the school environment? 3 -How do you consider that the new knowledge and scientific concepts have come to school? Interview teachers outside the school environment, with their free and informed consent, we transcribe their speech and recorded and we identify the key expressions, the central ideas and the anchoring of the speeches. Then we make up the following DSC: (A) on school failure: two DSCs, an anchor with in "the absence of the family contributes to the failure of students in school"; and another on "school failure represents the failure of society in General"; (B) school health: two DSCs, an anchor with in school health "goes wrong; poor families do not take care of health and hygiene "; and another on "students are not having access to health; students feel hungry at school; have many health problems, as well as teachers; (C) on Science and knowledge: a DSC, an anchor with in: the science and knowledge come to school very precarious. Our results reveal a concern for teachers about the difficulties of the education of the students, mostly of poor origin, characterized by the imputation of school failure of students, families and society to the State. The opinions expressed in the speeches performed basically in two ways: on the one hand, showed the existence of elements of prejudices, beliefs about the labels and difficulties in students ' performance and their condition of poverty; show reviews the school system, the difficulties of access for students and their families to basic health services and on the links between the Academy and the school.
