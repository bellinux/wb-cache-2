5|$|The {{concept of}} {{evolution}} was widely accepted in scientific circles {{within a few}} years of the publication of Origin, but the acceptance of natural selection as its <b>driving</b> <b>mechanism</b> was much less widespread. The four major alternatives to natural selection in the late 19th century were theistic evolution, neo-Lamarckism, orthogenesis, and saltationism. Alternatives supported by biologists at other times included structuralism, Georges Cuvier's teleological but non-evolutionary functionalism, and vitalism.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} was to analyze the Earth's rotation, and to compare the observations with the atmospheric and seismic excitation functions. The variation in the Earth's rotation can be separated into the length-of-day (LOD) variation and the polar motion. Possible <b>driving</b> <b>mechanisms</b> include: atmospheric/oceanic circulations, seismic activities, solar-lunar tides, mantle convection, core-mantle coupling, and solar activities. The major problem of concern was the identification of these dynamical processes as primary <b>driving</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for the various features in the variation of the Earth's rotation...|$|R

25|$|The key {{principle}} of plate tectonics {{is that the}} lithosphere exists as separate and distinct tectonic plates, which ride on the fluid-like (visco-elastic solid) asthenosphere. Plate motions range up to a typical 10–40mm/year (Mid-Atlantic Ridge; about as fast as fingernails grow), to about 160mm/year (Nazca Plate; about as fast as hair grows). The <b>driving</b> <b>mechanism</b> behind this movement is described below.|$|E
25|$|The roAp stars {{oscillate}} in high-overtone, low-degree, non-radial pressure modes. The usual {{model that}} is used to explain the behavior of these pulsations is the oblique pulsator model. In this model the axis of pulsation is aligned with the magnetic axis, which can lead to modulation of the amplitude of the pulsation, depending on the orientation of the axis to the line of sight, as it varies with rotation. The apparent link between the magnetic axis and the pulsation axis gives clues {{to the nature of the}} <b>driving</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the pulsations. As the roAp stars seem to occupy the main sequence end of the δ Scuti instability strip, it has been suggested that the <b>driving</b> <b>mechanism</b> may be similar, i.e. the opacity mechanism operating in the Hydrogen ionization zone. No standard pulsation model can be made to excite oscillations of the roAp type using the opacity mechanism. As the magnetic field appears to be important, research has taken this into account in deriving non-standard pulsation models. It has been suggested that the modes are driven by the suppression of convection by the strong magnetic field near the magnetic poles of these stars which would account for the alignment of the pulsation axis with the magnetic axis. An instability strip for the roAp stars has been calculated which agreed with the positions on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram of the roAp stars discovered up to that point, but predicted the existence of longer period pulsators amongst the more evolved roAp stars. Such a pulsator was discovered in HD 177765 which has the longest pulsation period of any roAp star at 23.6 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Solubility of {{gases in}} liquids is {{influenced}} {{by the nature of the}} solvent liquid and the solute, the temperature, pressure, and the presence of other solutes in the solvent. Diffusion is faster in smaller, lighter molecules of which helium is the extreme example. Diffusivity of helium is 2.65 times faster than nitrogen. The concentration gradient, can be used as a model for the <b>driving</b> <b>mechanism</b> of diffusion. In this context, inert gas refers to a gas which is not metabolically active. Atmospheric nitrogen (N2) is the most common example, and helium (He) is the other inert gas commonly used in breathing mixtures for divers. Atmospheric nitrogen has a partial pressure of approximately 0.78bar at sea level. Air in the alveoli of the lungs is diluted by saturated water vapour (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2), a metabolic product given off by the blood, and contains less oxygen (O2) than atmospheric air as some of it is taken up by the blood for metabolic use. The resulting partial pressure of nitrogen is about 0,758bar.|$|E

2500|$|The Experiment, built {{sometime}} around 1807-1810, {{was an early}} horse-powered ferry boat. It was a twelve-ton three-mast boat drawing {{a few feet of}} water, about 100 feet long by 20 feet beam. Its <b>driving</b> <b>mechanism,</b> an in-water screw, was invented by David Grieve in 1801. The boat was constructed by David Wilkinson (some sources give his name as Varnum) in 1807 to 1810, depending on the source. It was propelled by a [...] "goose-foot paddle" [...] large mechanical screw propeller in the water (instead of a paddle wheel at water surface). The new technology devised by Grieve and Wilkinson was powered by eight horses on a treadmill. The horse boat technology to propel the boat upstream was originally invented by David Grieve and granted a patent February 24, 1801 in the patent category of [...] "Boats to ascend rivers". The complete recorded patent was lost in the 1836 U.S. Patent Office fire. The novel idea of propelling vessels upstream by the use of a large mechanical screw in the water is now referred to as Ericsson’s propeller.|$|E

For a sample of more than five hundred molecular clouds, we find that they are preferentially elongated along the Galactic plane. On the other hand, their spin axes are randomly oriented. We therefore conclude that the elongation is not supported by internal spin but by internal velocity anisotropy. It has been known that some <b>driving</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are necessary to sustain the supersonic velocity dispersion within molecular clouds. The mechanism for generating the velocity dispersion must also account for the preferred elongation.

40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{and analysis of}} blazar sources provide strong evidence for (i) the presence of significant periodicities in their lightcurves and (ii) the occurrence of helical trajectories in their radio jets. In scenarios, where the periodicity is caused by differential Doppler boosting effects along a helical jet path, both of these facts may be naturally tied together. Here we discuss four possible <b>driving</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for the occurrence of helical trajectories: orbital motion in a binary system, Newtonian-driven jet precession, internal jet rotation and motion along a global helical magnetic field. We point out that for non-ballistic helical motion the observed period may appear strongly shortened due to classical travel time effects.
