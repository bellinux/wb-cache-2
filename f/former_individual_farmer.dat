40|$|This {{contribution}} {{deals with}} simulation modelling to help manage agricultural production systems. It describes {{the use of}} a Systems Dynamics complex model to simulating the functioning of pig slurry collective spreading plans in Brittany (Northwestern France), where intensive livestock farming has a well-known harmful environmental impact, namely on groundwater and coastal waters. The simulated plan involves 11 pig farms (encompassing both livestock and crops) located in a zone with excess slurry and 11 land owners located at about 40 km from the <b>former.</b> <b>Individual</b> pig <b>farmers</b> use part of their slurry to fertilise their own crops while they are regularly collected by collectively managed trucks to export their excess slurry to be applied on the remote crop farms. The model dynamically simulates the slurry stock evolutions at the pig farms and the spreading fluxes on crops, both at the pig farms and the remote crop farms. It simulates also several indicators likely to assess the environmental impact of this spreading organization's functioning: gas emissions (ammonia, methane) at slurry storage and application, time/distance spent in slurry transportation and application, excess Nitrogen with potential water pollution risk. It shows also the interaction between the individual farm and the collective organization levels...|$|R

50|$|In other cases, the Chinese system {{results in}} {{something}} quite different. For example, it {{is a common}} misconception that reforms under Deng Xiaoping resulted in the privatization of agricultural land and a creation of a land tenure system similar to those found in Western countries. In actuality, the village committee owns the land and contracts the right to use this land to <b>individual</b> <b>farmers</b> who may use the land to make money from agriculture. Hence the rights that are normally unified in Western economies are split up between the <b>individual</b> <b>farmer</b> and the village committee.|$|R

40|$|Farmers {{experienced}} {{a great number}} of important changes caused by the development of socialism on one hand and changes in the established socialistic social system on the other in the postwar development of Yugoslav society. Namely, the appearance of <b>individual</b> <b>farmers</b> as a basic form of farming was connnected with that aspect in the development of socialistic methods of production that was carried out by means of a series of socio- political measures such as: expropriation, sequestration, agrarian reform, nationalization. The whole social structure of jugoslav society as such was being changed by those measures: farmes, representing majority of population till then, were placed within the frames of individual farming, were »compressed« within the limited farmlands relying on their own labour force. The established social system had another influence as well causing changes in the stratum of <b>individual</b> <b>farmers</b> by means of socio-economic measures fully expressed in industrialization. That is, forces of production were generally underdeveloped and emphasis was on the progress of industry and social sector that were {{to be used as a}} »lever« in the realization of socialism, in such a perspective of development, agriculture and <b>individual</b> <b>farmers</b> were comprehended as material and human basis for creating social ownership and modern economy. But socio-economic and socio-political measures were neither of the same nature, nor had the same influence upon farmers in the periods of ethat ism and self-managing socialism. When the socialistic self-management was introduced and later developed those measures became less »compulsary« and more economic. Gradually <b>individual</b> <b>farmers</b> became commodity producers; at the same time their social status became equal to other cathegories of population. On the other hand, under the influence of industrialization farmers started leaving their villages, thus turning from farmers into workers. During the last 35 years the influence of all the factors caused {{a great number of}} changes among <b>individual</b> <b>farmers,</b> the most important being the »melting« of farmers as a traditional category.
