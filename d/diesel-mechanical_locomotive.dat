25|$|The railway {{first thought}} {{of using a}} diesel {{locomotive}} in the early 1970s, when a small four-wheeled <b>diesel-mechanical</b> <b>locomotive</b> built by Ruston & Hornsby (their class 48DL) was bought second-hand from a quarry. It was intended to regauge it {{and use it as}} a yard shunter at Llanberis. It was sold to the Llanberis Lake Railway in 1978 without being regauged or used on the SMR. It would have been the railway's only locomotive without pinions, and as such would have been of limited use – it is doubtful if it would have had sufficient grip on the grease covered rails to shunt a dead steam locomotive. This locomotive has since been dismantled and scrapped.|$|E
2500|$|The world's first {{diesel-powered}} locomotive was {{operated in}} the summer of 1912 on the Winterthur–Romanshorn railroad in Switzerland, but was not a commercial success. [...] In 1906, Rudolf Diesel, Adolf Klose and the steam and Diesel engine manufacturer Gebrüder Sulzer founded Diesel-Sulzer-Klose GmbH to manufacture diesel-powered locomotives. Sulzer had been manufacturing Diesel engines since 1898. The Prussian State Railways ordered [...] a diesel locomotive from the company in 1909, and after test runs between Winterthur and Romanshorn the <b>diesel–mechanical</b> <b>locomotive</b> was delivered in Berlin in September 1912. [...] During further test runs in 1913 several problems were found. After the First World War broke out in 1914, all further trials were stopped. The locomotive weight was 95 tonnes and the power was 883kW with a maximum speed of 100km/h. [...] Small numbers of prototype diesel locomotives were produced in a number of countries through the mid-1920s.|$|E

2500|$|The English Electric company, {{which had}} absorbed the engine-maker Napier & Son into its {{group at the}} {{instruction}} of the Ministry of Aircraft Production in 1942, was a major builder of diesel and electric locomotives. The two George Nelsons (Sir George, and his son, known in the works as [...] "Half") saw the potential of Napier's Deltic engine for rail traction and in 1954–1955 built a demonstrator at its Dick, Kerr works in Preston. Officially numbered DP1, its internal project title was Enterprise, and it was intended that the locomotive would carry that name. However, in 1954, before completion, Hudswell Clarke announced a range of small <b>diesel-mechanical</b> <b>locomotives</b> using the same name. After initial trials in 1955, the locomotive received the DELTIC in large cream letters on its sides, and the name became synonymous with the locomotive.|$|R

50|$|In 1948 {{the first}} British main-line diesel {{electric}} locomotive {{had been driven}} out of the paint shop by Ivatt himself, number 10,000, {{just in time to}} have LMS livery. Its sibling 10001 began its life in British Railways livery. In 1952 the experimental <b>diesel-mechanical</b> <b>locomotive,</b> the Fell diesel, went into service.|$|E
50|$|The British Rail Class 03 diesel (pictured) is a {{more recent}} example. Jackshafts were used on some <b>diesel-mechanical</b> and diesel-hydraulic <b>locomotives</b> but were seldom used on diesel-electrics. One {{exception}} was the British Rail Class D3/7.|$|R
5000|$|In January 1927 six bridges {{along the}} Etheridge line were {{destroyed}} by floods and the government sought to close the line beyond the lime works at Ootann, just south of Almaden. Due to public pressure the line was reopened in 1928, after the building of low-level bridges, {{but it was only}} maintained to standard suitable for use by railmotors. Steam trains did not operate on the line again until after the section from Almaden to Mount Surprise was reconditioned between 1949 and 1951 to allow the transport of heavier loads of cattle than could be pulled by diesel engines. This included adding 60 pound per yard rails on corners, regrading in six places, and one deviation. From the 1950s <b>diesel-mechanical</b> <b>locomotives</b> operated in multiple south of Mount Surprise to allow larger loads of cattle to be moved on the section of line to Forsayth. They were followed by diesel electric locomotives. This work assisted the cattle industry but the building of a bituminized [...] "Beef Road" [...] from Georgetown to Cairns reduced the use of the Etheridge line for cattle from the late 1960s. The use of steam locomotives to Mount Surprise ended in 1969.|$|R
50|$|The British Rail Class 04 was a 0-6-0 <b>diesel-mechanical</b> {{shunting}} <b>locomotive</b> class, built between 1952 and 1962 and was {{the basis}} for the later Class 03 built in the British Railways workshops. However, the first locomotive to be built to the design was actually DS1173, in 1948, which served as a departmental shunter at Hither Green depot, before being transferred to the capital stock list as D2341 in 1967. The Class 04 locomotives were supplied by the Drewry Car Co., which at the time (and for most of its existence) had no manufacturing capability. Drewry sub-contracted the construction work to two builders both of whom built other locomotives under the same arrangement. Early locomotives (including DS1173) were built by Vulcan Foundry and later examples were built by Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns.|$|R
50|$|In 1998 {{the engine}} was rebuilt into a <b>diesel-mechanical</b> <b>locomotive</b> when it gained a Ford {{industrial}} engine with Spicer Compact Shuttle transmission. It is currently a mixed traffic engine and used throughout the year. Its livery was originally blue with a silver roof, but has been two-tone green of various shades since 1978.|$|E
50|$|Lady Wakefield, known colloquially as Doris, is a B-B <b>diesel-mechanical</b> <b>locomotive</b> {{completed}} at Ravenglass in 1980 and designed by Ian Smith, the railway's chief {{engineer at the}} time, based on a layout proposal by Neil Simpkins for the Romney, Hythe & Dymchurch Railway. It was built with a 112 bhp Perkins 6/354 engine, identical to that in Shelagh of Eskdale at the time. The engine has a Twin Disc gearbox and driveshafts to each end, along with chain-coupled wheels in centreless bogies.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{arrangement is}} to use long coupling rods, running horizontally. A large vertical movement at the wheel end gives rise to only a small horizontal movement at the jackshaft drive. For a <b>diesel-mechanical</b> <b>locomotive</b> this can be compensated for by horizontally compliant mounting of the transmission. The heavy engine is carried over the drive wheels for adhesion weight, but the relatively lightweight gearbox can be mounted at one end, beyond the coupled wheelbase. A final drive casing is also narrow enough to mount between the frames, allowing it to be mounted low down and level with the driving axles.|$|E
50|$|Locomotive #1 is {{an unusual}} combination. Virtually all {{internal}} combustion locomotives are diesel-electrics, powered by a diesel prime mover driving a generator which in turn drives one or more electric traction motors; apart from some <b>diesel-mechanical</b> and diesel-hydraulic <b>locomotives.</b> All of the major manufacturers had discarded the use of gasoline engines by the middle 1930s in favor of diesel, primarily {{on the grounds of}} fuel economy. Vulcan continued to produce a very limited number of both while it also continued to produce steam locomotives. In early 1942 it is likely that war needs made it easier to get a gasoline engine than a diesel because a gasoline engine uses much less material.|$|R
50|$|In a <b>diesel-mechanical</b> <b>locomotive,</b> {{the prime}} mover is the diesel engine that is {{mechanically}} coupled to the driving wheels (drivers). In a diesel-electric locomotive, the prime mover is the diesel engine that rotates the main generator responsible for producing electricity {{to power the}} traction motors that are geared to the drivers. The prime mover {{can also be a}} gas turbine instead of a diesel engine. In either case, the generator, traction motors and interconnecting apparatus are considered to be the power transmission system and not part of the prime mover. A wired-electric or battery-electric locomotive has no on-board prime mover, instead relying on an external power station.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{plan for the}} railway called for steam engines to pull the coaches, with diesel engines in reserve. The railway opened under {{the power of a}} 1948 diesel-electric end-cab two-axle General Electric locomotive, however, with a 1939 two-axle Whitcomb <b>diesel-mechanical</b> <b>locomotive</b> providing backup. Steam locomotives are scheduled to take over from the diesel engines when renovation of a pair of Baldwin outside-frame 0-6-2 tank engines is complete. These steam engines had originally worked at the Honolulu Plantation Company on Oahu prior to World War II. They were purchased for the Kauai Plantation Railway from a company in the Philippines where they had been in service until 2001.|$|E

50|$|Two further {{cars were}} added later, {{bringing}} the fleet strength up to thirteen. A four-wheeled petrol-mechanical locomotive was acquired from Hardy Railmotors of Slough, Berkshire, {{to handle the}} residual goods traffic on the railway, but this proved to be underpowered and was replaced {{after a few years}} by a <b>diesel-mechanical</b> <b>locomotive</b> by John Fowler & Co., of Leeds. The Hardy locomotive was retained for a few years and used for shunting the cars in the depot, which was {{on the site of the}} former carriage sheds, adjacent to the Rutland Street terminus, and for inspection of the overhead line equipment, but it had been dismantled by 1954, when parts were used in the construction of a replica horse-drawn car to celebrate the line's 150th anniversary.|$|E
