Jane, a college freshman, is walking through campus on the way back to her dorm from her Biology 101 class. Usually, Jane’s walk is uneventful, aside from the occasional run-in with a friend or sorority sister; however, today is much different. Jane notices that many people are staring, pointing, and snickering at her. Is there something on her face? She quickly pulls out her compact and realizes that all makeup is intact. Is there something wrong with her clothes? She briskly looks herself over and nothing is out of place. Paranoid, Jane starts to walk back to her dorm a little faster, but people are still staring. All of a sudden, someone in the crowd yells, “Hey Jane, nice picture on collegegossip. com!” Confused, Jane tries to imagine what this guy is talking about. What picture? Her memory is faded from the events of last weekend due to her drinking too much at a keg party. But her friends would not have let anyone take picture of her passed out, right? Finally arriving at her dorm, Jane hurries onto the computer and goes to the website. There, Jane is horrified to view an anonymously posted picture of her passed out naked on a stranger’s bed. Under the picture is a string of comments claiming that Jane is a “whore, who gave me syphilis. ” Desperate, Jane contacts the operators of the website and begs them to remove the picture and the comments. Jane also informs the operators that she has never contracted a sexually transmitted disease and that, if they did not remove the material, she would sue for defamation. Days later, the operators respond to Jane, and tell her that they are protected by federal law and are not required to remove the statements. The operators also inform Jane that the anonymous posters have a First Amendment right to tell it how it is. Unfortunately, this nightmare is all too real. Anonymous gossip websites, blogs, social networking websites, online bulletin boards, and other similar types of Internet forums allow people to speak their minds and exercise their First Amendment right to free speech and expression; however, these online forums can be abused when people use the sites to defame others. When a defamatory statement is posted on the Internet, it is often times difficult to locate the individual responsible because most of the <b>defamers</b> are given anonymity by their Internet service provider (“ISP”). Plaintiffs in Internet defamation suits are unable to easily name their <b>defamers</b> since usually only the <b>defamer’s</b> screen name is available. Furthermore, most courts interpret the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (“CDA”) to give ISPs complete immunity from liability for the defamatory posts of third parties, even if notified that certain statements are defamatory. Thus, ISPs have no civil liability to remove defamatory material, and the defamed plaintiffs are left with little recourse. This judicial interpretation of the CDA is significantly different from the well-established common law of defamation, as well as the very purpose for the enactment of the CDA. Internet defamation is an increasing problem, leaving the defamed helpless and the <b>defamers</b> believing they have a First Amendment right to post defamatory content. This Article will reemphasize the notion that the First Amendment does not protect defamatory speech on the Internet. Part I of this Article will discuss defamation law as part of common law, as applied to the Internet before the passage of the CDA, while Part II will discuss the judicial interpretation of the CDA in defamation cases. Part III of this Article will address the problems with the CDA as currently interpreted by the judicial system. Finally, Part IV will propose amendments to the CDA, which are intended to clarify the statute in order to give more legal options to defamed victims. Furthermore, Part IV will explain how the proposed amendments would not violate the First Amendment...|$|R

University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2012 Early English Consistory court records contain hundreds of defamation {{cases in which}} one party is suing another party for slander or verbal violence. Slander cases varied greatly, but most often held sexual, economic, or criminal implications, thus resulting in the tarnishing of the victim's honor or reputation. Recent scholars have generally agreed that gender is central in studies of honor, reputation, and defamation, but have tended to accept and perpetuate the conventional gender binary {{as a means to}} analyze male and female involvement in slander litigation. This perspective has resulted in conclusions about the general continuity of female oppression within English society. In this study, I adopt a different understanding of gender by applying Judith Butler's theory of gender performativity to these legal disputes. <b>Defamers</b> frequently attacked others for acting outside of culturally promoted gender constructions, resulting in a multiplicity of gender identities that expand far beyond the restricted labels of "woman" and "man. " My work suggests that when slanderers used terms like "whore", "strumpet", "scold", "gossip", "cuckold", and "bastard", {{it was part of a}} larger discourse of determining the social bounds of acceptable gender in early English culture. Furthermore, I demonstrate that these constructions of gender developed through an ongoing synthesis of religious influences, literary culture, and even one's neighborhood residence. In this dynamic, slander and its subsequent litigation offered a public arena in which agents theatrically challenged, negotiated, and reinterpreted popular perception of self and identity.

He had only put a book into its own place, carrying out {{as he did so}} his innocent intention when he had first lifted the book. When these searchers had come, doing their work so idly, with such incurious futility, he had not concealed the book. He had left it there on its shelf beneath their hands.

His very knees would fail to carry him through the court. The words would stick in his jaws. He would shake and shiver and faint before the assembled eyes. It would be easier for him to throw himself from the rocks on which he had lain dreaming into the sea than to go into a court of law and there tell his own story as to the will. They could not force him to go. He thought he could perceive as much as that. The action, if action there were to be, must originate with him. There was no evidence on which they could bring a charge of felony or even of fraud against him. They could not drag him into the court. But he knew that all the world would say that if he were an honest man, he himself would appear there, denounce his <b>defamers,</b> and vindicate his own name. As day by day he failed to do so, he would be declaring his own guilt. Yet he knew that he could not do it.|$|R

6000|$|We {{are very}} much surprized, {{and we are not}} the only persons who feel disgust as well as astonishment, at the {{uncalled}} for avowal Lord Byron has made of being the Author of some insolent lines, by inserting them {{at the end of his}} new Poem, entitled [...] "The Corsair." [...] The lines we allude to begin [...] "Weep, Daughter of a Royal Line." [...] Nothing can be more repugnant to every good heart, as well as to the moral and religious feelings of a country, which we are proud to say still cherishes every right sentiment, than an attempt to lower a father in the eyes of his child. Lord Byron is a young man, and from the tenor of his writings, has, we fear, adopted principles very contrary to those of Christianity. But as a man of honour and of feeling, which latter character he affects outrageously, he ought never to have been guilty of so unamiable and so unprovoked an attack. Should so gross an insult to her Royal Father ever meet the eyes of the illustrious young Lady, for whose perusal it was intended, we trust her own good sense and good heart will teach her to consider it with the contempt and abhorrence it so well merits. Will she weep for the disgrace of a Father who has saved Europe from bondage, and has accumulated, in the short space of two years, more glory than can be found in any other period of British history? Will she [...] "weep for a realm's decay," [...] when that realm is hourly emerging under the Government of her father, from the complicated embarrassments in which he found it involved? But all this is too evident to need being particularised. What seems most surprising is, that Lord Byron should chuse to avow Irish trash at a moment when every thing conspires to give it the lie. It is for the organ of the Party alone, or a few insane admirers of Bonaparte and <b>defamers</b> of their own country and its rulers, to applaud him. We know it is now the fashion for our young Gentlemen to become Poets, and a very innocent amusement it is, while they confine themselves to putting their travels into verse, like Childe Harolde, and Lord Nugent's Portugal. Nor is there any harm in Turkish tales, nor wonderful ditties, of ghosts and hobgoblins. We cannot say so much for all Mr. Moore's productions, admired as he is by Lord Byron. In short, the whole galaxy of minor poets, Lords Nugent and Byron, with Messrs. Rogers, Lewis, and Moore, would do well to keep to rhyme, and not presume to meddle with politics, for which they seem mighty little qualified. We must repeat, that it is innocent to write tales and travels in verse, but calumny can never be so, whether written by poets in St. James's-street, Albany, or Grub-street.|$|R
40|$|Though {{the rapid}} {{development}} of the Internet has created a fertile ground for legal innovation, {{more often than not}} legislators and courts have sought to address this relatively new medium by attempting to squeeze it into precedents and paradigms better suited to older forms of communication, technology, and media. Part I of this article looks back at the courts 2 ̆ 7 initial efforts at addressing defamation via the Internet. From the start the courts attempted to fit the role of the ISP into the common law 2 ̆ 7 s categorizing of print media as either 2 ̆ 2 publishers 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 distributors 2 ̆ 2 of information. One court 2 ̆ 7 s misstep in overextending the liability of one ISP to that of a publisher led Congress to sweep ISP liability into the CDA in an attempt to give ISPs more tools to regulate content they consider offensive. Part I then {{takes a look at the}} most recent major Internet defamation case, Blumenthal v. Drudge, and how it cemented the current regime, which interprets Congress 2 ̆ 7 s prohibition of ISP liability for 2 ̆ 2 publishers 2 ̆ 2 as a prohibition against virtually all liability and not a narrowing of ISP liability to that of a 2 ̆ 2 distributor. 2 ̆ 2 The potential ramifications for allowing ISPs to be liable as 2 ̆ 2 distributors 2 ̆ 2 of third party defamatory content are addressed in Part III. In particular, the section focuses on whether a notice-based liability regime could function on the Internet without either compromising the medium 2 ̆ 7 s main advantages or chilling free speech. Part IV takes into account these same concerns while arguing for a narrow application of 2 ̆ 2 publisher 2 ̆ 2 liability to those few ISPs that fulfill a content-providing role akin to that of a publisher of a newspaper or magazine. By examining the Drudge case directly, this comment demonstrates how traditional safeguards in defamation law like the 2 ̆ 2 actual malice 2 ̆ 2 standard for public figures will severely limit the chances of these ISPs to fall victim to unwarranted liability, and that a federal exemption from 2 ̆ 2 publisher 2 ̆ 2 liability for ISPs was never really necessary. Defamation law is one field where Congress could effectively legislate a federal standard based on prior precedents with minor tweaking without taking the sledgehammer tactic of providing blanket immunity to those who provide access to the <b>defamers</b> of tomorrow. A federal standard is necessary due to the unique jurisdictional concerns of the Internet that are examined in Part V. Congress should reform the CDA to create a more even playing field between Internet media providers and broadcast and print media providers so that the former (just as much as the latter) may be found liable as 2 ̆ 2 distributors 2 ̆ 2 when they fall to remove defamatory content of which they are aware. In addition, if an ISP commissions and edits information content in a manner analogous to newspaper or book publishers, it should be held to the stricter 2 ̆ 2 publisher 2 ̆ 2 standard of fault as well...|$|R

[...] We need not, however, confine our vindication of Burke to his own eloquence, but invite the especial attention of his accusers and <b>defamers</b> unto two forgotten facts: 1st. A few weeks before Fox died, he dictated a despatch to Lord Yarmouth, which confirmed all the policy for which Pitt for fifteen years had contended: moreover, in a debate on Wyndham's [...] "Military System," [...] 1806, Fox thus delivered his own recantation:--"Indeed, by the circumstances of Europe, I AM READY TO CONFESS I HAVE BEEN WEANED FROM THE OPINIONS I FORMERLY HELD WITH RESPECT TO THE FORCE WHICH MIGHT SUFFICE IN TIME OF PEACE: nor do I consider this any inconsistency, because I see no rational prospect of any peace, which would exempt us from the necessity of watchful preparation and powerful establishment." [...] But the change of Fox's opinions, and their similarity to those maintained by Pitt, with reference to our war with France, are by no means ALL which history can produce in justification of Burke's political wisdom and consistency. The whole civilized world has read the [...] "Reflections on the French Revolution," [...] whose sale, in one year, achieved the enormous number of 30,000 copies, in connection with medals or marks of honour from almost every Court in Europe. Now, of all the replies made to this masterpiece of reasoning and reflection, Mackintosh's [...] "Vindiciae Gallicae" [...] was incontestably the ablest and profoundest. And yet, the greatest of all his intellectual opponents thus addresses Burke, as appears from [...] "Memoirs" [...] of Mackintosh, volume i. page 87:--"The enthusiasm with which I once embraced the instruction conveyed in your writings is now ripened into solid conviction by the experience and conviction of more mature age. For a time, SEDUCED BY THE LOVE OF WHAT I THOUGHT LIBERTY, I ventured to oppose, without ceasing to venerate, that writer who had nourished my understanding with the most wholesome principles of political wisdom...Since that time, A MELANCHOLY EXPERIENCE HAS UNDECEIVED ME ON MANY SUBJECTS, IN WHICH I WAS THE DUPE OF MY OWN ENTHUSIASM." [...] Let us part from this branch of our subject by quoting Burke's own words, uttered, as it were, on the very brink of eternity. They attest, to the latest moment of his life, with what a sacred intensity and unflinching sincerity he clung to his original sentiments touching the French Revolution. Nor let the present writer shrink from adding, they constitute but one of the many specimens of that instinctive prescience, whereby this profoundest of philosophical statesmen was enabled to herald from afar the final triumphs of courage, patriotism, and truth. The passage occurs towards the conclusion of his [...] "Letters on a Regicide Peace," [...] and is as follows:--"Never succumb. It is a struggle for your existence as a nation. If you must die, die with the sword in your hand. But I have no fear whatever for the result.

50|$|The band {{formed in}} 2008 {{for the simple}} reason that {{founding}} members, Josh Bliesner from death metal/hardcore band Western Decay and James Geekie from death metal band <b>Defamer</b> were frustrated at the lack of stoner rock bands in Brisbane at the time. The band cites Kyuss, Monster Magnet and Electric Wizard as their main influences. The original plan for the band was to be a Live-Only project playing shows almost exclusively at local metal venues. Within 12 months, the band has developed a strong enough local following to earn the supports with Mondo Generator featuring ex-Kyuss member, Nick Oliveri and UK band Winnebago Deal.|$|E

5000|$|Navigating {{his course}} between the warring PMR groups of Pauker and Gheorghiu-Dej, Răutu {{established}} his reputation {{during the fall}} of a third faction, Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu's [...] "Secretariat" [...] group. Already in Împotriva cosmopolitismului..., Răutu called his rival an [...] "enemy of the working class", and a <b>defamer</b> of Marxist values. As noted by Tismăneanu, he applied [...] "his proverbial zeal" [...] to condemning Pătrășcanu's entire political activity. With the Tito-Stalin split, Răutu also became involved in exposing supposed [...] "Titoist" [...] infiltrations in Romania, ordering a tight monitoring of Tanjug propaganda, and then a Romanian Agitprop project focused on vilifying Yugoslavia. In parallel, he took over supervision of the nominally independent left-wing daily Adevărul, overseeing its liquidation in 1951.|$|E
50|$|Rafiq Taqi, a {{journalist}} residing in Baku, Azerbaijan was fatally stabbed based on fatwa of an Ayatollah the student of Ayatollah Khomeini in 2011, accused to apostasy and blasphemy {{because of his}} articles. Kadivar denounced the ruling of execution openly and wrote a book on this issue. Here is the abstract of his opinions {{in the case of}} apostasy and blasphemy in Islam: There is no reliable proof from the Qur’an, Sunnah, consensus (ijmaʻ), or reason that can establish the validity of shedding the blood of anyone who has been accused of apostasy or defaming the Prophet. On the contrary, this goes against the Qur’an and reason. Moreover, the negative effects that would ensue from making licit the shedding of someone’s blood would be plenty and, as such, would certainly weaken Islam.Only a sound judicial system can issue a judgment and supervise its implementation. The issuance of a judgment by a jurist who is qualified to issue a legal opinion (fatwa), out of judicial system, does not suffice.A judgment on the apostate and <b>defamer</b> of the Prophet is absolutely lacking in evidence from the Qur’an. Traditional jurists, by employing ijtihad, have arrived at this judgment and have claimed consensus by relying on solitary (akhbar wahid) or dependable (muwatthaqah) hadiths.The ruling on killing the apostate and <b>defamer</b> of the Prophet is incorrect and not possible to implement on account of the following seven proofs:(a) The necessity of stopping the implementation of the rule of execution of an apostate or a blasphemer as a secondary injunction, “debilitating Islam” (avoiding the harm or seeking public welfare or governmental injunction).(b) The necessity of suspending or stopping the implemention of a punishment for hudud that would lead to killing of a person during the Occultation of the Twelfth Imam.(c) Since the judgment on killing is based on solitary reports (al-akhbar al-ahad), it is mandatory to exercise caution by negation of rule of shedding someone’s blood.(d) Any judgment of killing based on solitary reports is not a valid basis for dealing with vital and critical issues.(e) Alteration of the subject matter or situational context (mawduʻ) of apostasy.(f) The hadiths mandating execution of apostate and <b>defamer</b> of the Prophet are contrary to Qur’anic dictates.(g) The rational proof is too weak to establish the execution of one who abandons religion or insults the holy personages.In conclusion, exiting from religion (i.e., apostasy) has no temporal punishment. Executing anyone on the basis of insulting the Prophet or the Qur’an or other sacred objects in Islam is therefore indefensible.|$|E
