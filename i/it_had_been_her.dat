She related her experiences working at Dear Stage, where originally worked as a waitress and performer. She said that she worked hard to meet customer expectations, and that performing at the venue's stage would prove to be a valuable experience as it would allow her to perform at larger stages with more imagination and inspiration. She mentioned that while writing lyrics for anime series, she wants the tone and mood of her songs to match the anime's setting.|$|E

More {{experienced}} actors, including Atiqah Hasiholan and Reza Rahadian (who had received two Citra Awards), were also cast. Hasiholan later stated that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>her</b> most challenging role yet, citing the cultural differences between the Bajau and what she was familiar with as well as her unprecedented need to act as a mother. In preparing for their roles, Hasiholan exercised slicing and dicing fish, while Rahadian went to Ancol in North Jakarta to learn about dolphins.|$|E
5|$|Taonere Banda was {{the first}} Malawian Paralympic athlete to compete at the quadrennial event. She {{qualified}} for the games by using a wildcard because the country {{did not have any}} athletes who met the qualification standards. Banda spent the 60 days in the buildup to Rio training for the event, but amenities in Malawi were imperfect and she trained on a dusty, uneven running track without standard defined lanes. She stated that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>her</b> childhood ambition to represent Malawi at a major international sporting event and this was her sole opportunity to prove her athletic abilities in her event, the 1500 metres (T13). Banda was drawn in the first heat on 8 September. She attacked the first lap aggressively taking up a commanding lead, but her initial speed saw her tire in the latter stages and she lost the lead in the last 600 metres of the race to finish fourth. Banda was later disqualified when she was observed to leave her lane during the heat. Nevertheless, she said that when she returned to Malawi, she would encourage people with disabilities to work hard and participate in sporting events.|$|E

He also served {{as the chairman of}} Governing body of Ramjas College, University of Delhi, after the death of its Founder Shri Rai Kedarnath. Settling in Bombay (today called Mumbai), Ambedkar oversaw the construction of a house, and stocked his personal library with more than 50,000 books. His wife Ramabai died after a long illness the same year. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>her</b> long-standing wish to go on a pilgrimage to Pandharpur, but Ambedkar had refused to let her go, telling her that he would create a new Pandharpur for her instead of Hinduism's Pandharpur which treated them as untouchables. At the Yeola Conversion Conference on 13 October in Nasik, Ambedkar announced his intention to convert to a different religion and exhorted his followers to leave Hinduism. He would repeat his message at many public meetings across India.|$|E
25|$|Caroline is {{introduced}} in Last Tango in Halifaxs series premiere (2012), {{as a successful}} headmistress dealing with the fallout of her husband's affair and her own clandestine liaison with Kate. At {{the climax of the}} episode she is shocked to learn that her mother Celia has decided to marry Alan; an old love interest she had recently {{met for the first time}} in sixty years. She is also shocked upon discovering that Alan is father to Gillian, a working-class woman who Caroline has previously insulted. After learning that John is still seeing his lover Judith (Ronni Ancona), Caroline tells him he has no right to carry on living in their marital home. She grows closer to Kate, and explains to her that she finds it hard to be open with her feelings, having long suppressed her emotions. In the following episode, Caroline grows closer to Gillian after their respective parents go missing. She admits to John that she has moved on and began seeing someone else. When Caroline makes her relationship with Kate official, her eldest son William (Edward Ashley) takes it in his stride, but her younger son Lawrence (Louis Greatorex) is upset. When Judith arrives at Caroline's house she learns of the relationship and informs John who tells Celia. Celia refuses to accept that her daughter is gay and her bigoted words and attitude at a dinner party drive Kate away. Caroline has an angry argument with her mother, blaming her for her emotional repression and for ruining her chance of happiness with Kate. She reminds her that she had previously tried to come out to her at the age of 18, and that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>her</b> prejudices that had forced her to live a closeted existence. Celia, realising that she may have ruined her relationship with both her daughter and the liberal-minded Alan, is compelled to ask Kate to give Caroline another chance.|$|E
500|$|Marguerite Louise {{received}} a rudimentary education at her father's court at Blois, {{to which he}} withdrew after {{the failure of the}} insurrection against his nephew Louis XIV of France known as the Fronde. Marguerite Louise enjoyed a close relationship with her half-sister, Anne Marie Louise, Duchess of Montpensier, La Grande Mademoiselle, who took her and her friends to the theatre and royal balls; Marguerite Louise returned her sister's affection, attending Anne Marie Louise's salon daily and seeking her guidance in court matters. Marguerite Louise was convinced that Madame de Choisy advised her mother poorly in matters of court and ruined the negotiations for her marriage to Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy. In the end <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>her</b> own younger sister Françoise Madeleine d'Orléans who married Charles Emmanuel in 1663. It was for this reason that when another proposal came in 1658, this time from Cosimo de' Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany, Marguerite Louise asked her half-sister to bring it about.|$|E

Bowdish said that when he asked Joan if a family member had done it, Joan used her head to indicate [...] "yes". Bowdish has maintained that when he asked her whether <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>her</b> older son Jonathan, a Naval officer stationed in South Carolina during the attack, she shook her head, indicating it was not, but that she nodded her head up and down, indicating [...] "yes", when he asked her whether Christopher was responsible. Joan Porco's alleged identification of her son Christopher may explain why Bethlehem Police pursued her son soon after the incident, rather than conducting a broader investigation of potential suspects. She also answered in similar ways to other separate questions.|$|E
