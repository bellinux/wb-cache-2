60|$|After {{two long}} marches Colonel Parsons and his force arrived at El Fasher, {{on the right}} bank of the Atbara. Their advance, which had {{hitherto}} led them through a waterless desert, was now checked by a raging torrent. The river was in full flood, and a channel of deep water, broader than the Thames below London Bridge and racing along at seven miles an hour, formed a serious obstacle. Since there were no boats the soldiers began forthwith to construct rafts from barrels that had been brought for the purpose. As soon as {{the first of these}} was completed, it was sent on a trial trip. The result was not encouraging. The raft supported ten men, occupied five hours in the passage, was carried ten miles down stream, and came back for its second journey on the afternoon of the next day. It was evident that this means of transport was out of the question. The only chance of success--indeed, of safety--lay in the force reaching and taking Gedaref before the return of Ahmed Fedil. All depended upon speed; yet here was a hopeless delay. After prolonged discussion it was resolved to act on the suggestion of an Egyptian officer and endeavour to build boats. The work proved easier than was anticipated. The <b>elastic</b> <b>wood</b> of the mimosa scrub supplied the frames; some tarpaulins--fortunately available--formed the outer covering. The Egyptian soldiers, who delighted in the work, succeeded in making daily from such materials one boat capable of carrying two tons; and in these ingenious contrivances the whole force crossed to the further bank. The camels, mules, and horses of the transport--their heads supported with inflated water-skins tied under their jowls--were made to swim across the river by the local Shukrieh Arabs. Such was the skill of these tribesmen that only one camel and one mule were drowned during the operation. The passage was completed on the 16th, and the next day the advance was resumed along {{the west bank of the}} Atbara. At midday on the 18th Mugatta was reached, and at dawn on the 20th the little force--having filled their water-skins, tightened their belts, and invoked the assistance of the various gods they worshipped--started off, and marched all day in single file through the thick bush which lies between the Atbara and Gedaref. The column retired to rest peacefully during the night of the 21st, although within twelve miles of Gedaref. But at midnight startling news arrived. A deserter from the Dervishes made his way into the camp and informed Colonel Parsons that the Emir Saadalla awaited him with 3,500 men two miles before the town. The situation was grave. A retreat through the broken country and thick bush in the face of a powerful and triumphant enemy seemed impossible. There was no alternative but to attack.|$|E

Assumptions about agents' knowledge of future events are fundamental in all forms of models suggesting {{that the degree of}} information of future events may have large behavioral impacts. Despite the importance of this assumption, few studies have looked into what this difference in information may imply, and few studies have analyzed the importance of varying the degree of a priori information on the impacts of policy measures. This paper attempts to elucidate some of these impacts by comparing how an exogenous shock affects the Norwegian forest sector if the agents are assumed to have: (i) perfect information, (ii) information about the market shift only a limited time before its implementation or (iii) no a priori information. The shock analyzed is an import ban on all coniferous wood into Norway, which is possible if the Pinewood nematode (PWN) becomes more widespread in Europe. To examine this question, we adapt the Norwegian forest sector model NorFor to reflect perfect, limited and no prior information. The results indicate that if the agents anticipate the shock, they will begin to adjust harvest and production levels before it occurs. Due to high opportunity costs, harvest is reduced in the first periods to allow increases later. Bioenergy, with much lower profit than pulp and paper on the margin, is the hardest hit by the ban, while paper production is little affected. This may also be due to high capital costs in the paper industry and a perfectly <b>elastic</b> <b>wood</b> demand curve for bioenergy use. Substantial price increases for both raw materials and final products are suggested under either limited or perfect foresight.

The distribution, riparian requirements and ecosystem functions of yew populations in coastal and inland forests of northern California are outlined and alternative approaches to conserving this resource are identified. Efforts to obtain additional information on genetic diversity of yew populations and to insure careful management of the species are essential {{for the protection of}} this resource. selective harvesting of the Pacific yew in California, Oregon and Washington. In 1988, 60, 000 pounds of bark were harvested from 12, 000 trees in western Oregon; another harvest of the same magnitude is scheduled for 1989 (C. Bolsinger, personal communication). This paper briefly outlines the current status of the Pacific yew as a facultative component of riparian forest communities in northern California and other Western states, and addresses questions that bear on possible strategies to conserve the yew resource without intervening with ongoing cancer research. Yews represent a genetic resource at risk. At least three species–the English yew (T. baccata), Florida yew (Taxus floridana), and Pacific yew (T. brevifolia) – have evolved an unique assemblage of characteristics that confer upon these trees and shrubs unprecedented vulnerability. The English yew, native to Europe, north Africa and parts of the Middle East, was valued for centuries as a strategic resource. The Florida yew, restricted to bluffs and ravines on the eastern bank of the Apalachicola River in northern Florida (Sargent 1961), is classified as a rare and endangered conifer (Barnes 1983). Now the survival of Pacific yew populations in western states may be threatened by the discovery that yew bark is an important source of an antitumor drug. The yew has the longest tradition as a protected tree. In the 15 th century, English yew populations were severely depleted; their fine-grained <b>elastic</b> <b>wood</b> was valued for archery bows.

Additionally, bending elastic modulus which was decreased by giving some histories was increased with the passage of time. The reason of these results was considered as follows. When wood is given drying and/or quenching histories, molecular state of wood constituents is disturbed and microscopic strain is occurred in microstructure of wood. These microscopic strains are eliminated with the passage of time. In the eliminating process of microscopic strain, in other words, in unstable state in which the thermodynamic state of wood component transitions toward stable state, resistance of wood to external force is recovered.

Methods The axial <b>elastic</b> modulus of <b>wood</b> samples, representing a pith to bark cross-section, of six trees from several French Guianese species (two of Eperua falcata, one of Eperua grandiflora, two of Carapa procera and one of Symphonia gloubulifera) was measured using a dynamic "forced vibration" method. Results Primary forest trees were observed to have a decrease in wood stiffness from pith to bark, whereas plantation trees, from the same genus or species, displayed a corresponding increase in wood stiffness. Juvenile wood stiffness appears to vary depending on the environment in which the tree had grown. Conclusion We suggest that the growth strategy of primary forest trees is to produce wood resistant to self-buckling so that the height of the canopy may be obtained with the maximum of efficiency. In contrast, the growth strategy of the trees growing in an exposed plantation is to produce low-stiffness wood, important to provide flexibility in wind. Further experiments to study the behaviour of more species, with more individuals per species, growing across a range of physical environments, are required. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|There {{are several}} {{techniques}} {{to characterize the}} <b>elastic</b> modulus of <b>wood</b> and those currently using the natural frequencies of vibration stand out as they are non-destructive techniques, producing results that can be repeated and compared over time. This study reports {{on the effectiveness of}} the testing methods based on the natural frequencies of vibration versus static bending to obtain the elastic properties of reforested structural wood components usually employed in civil construction. The following components were evaluated: 24 beams of Eucalyptus sp. with nominal dimensions (40 x 60 x 2. 000 mm) and 14 beams of Pinus oocarpa with nominal dimensions (45 x 90 x 2. 300 mm) both without treatment; 30 boards with nominal dimensions (40 x 240 x 2. 010 mm) and 30 boards with nominal dimensions (40 x 240 x 3. 050 mm), both of Pinus oocarpa and with chromate copper arsenate (CCA) preservative treatment. The results obtained in thiswork show good correlation when compared to the results obtained by the static bending mechanical method, especially when applying the natural frequency of longitudinal vibration. The use of longitudinal frequency was reliable and practical, therefore recommended for determining the modulus of elasticity of wood structural elements. It was also found that no specific support is needed for the specimens using the longitudinal frequency, as well as no previous calibrations, reducing the execution time and enabling to test many samples...|$|R
40|$|Wood {{is mainly}} {{composed}} of oriented crystalline cellulose (~ 50 %). This component has an elastic linear behavior with a Young's modulus around 130 GPa [1], which gives wood its high stiffness. As a cristal, its Young's modulus {{is supposed to}} be time independent. The viscoelastic behavior of wood is then assumed to come from the matrix behavior and/or cinematic conditions at the interface between microfibrils and matrix, or between fibers, [...] . Studying the cinematic of crystals of cellulose in wood during a mechanical loading, and comparing it with wood cinematic at higher scale can produce valuable information to understand better the source wood macroscopic behavior. This methodology has already been used to understand the source of <b>elastic</b> behavior of <b>wood</b> using FTIR [2] or X-Ray diffraction [3], but not until now for the investigation of the viscous behavior of wood. The methodology {{of this study is to}} determine the cellulose crystals longitudinal strain (in average) using X-Ray diffraction technique from compression side to tension side during a four point bending creep test, and to compare with the longitudinal macroscopic strain on the same specimen. For this study, the tested specimens have been submitted to a constant load over time (~ 20 h) in flexion, both in dry and wet conditions. For the dry specimens, the results show that there is a roughly linear relationship between macroscopic strain and the cellulose crystal strain during creep, with a ratio close to 1 between those two strains. This suggests that all of the creep macroscopic strain is visible in the cellulose crystals, so all of the compartments responsible of viscous behavior in wood are parallel to cellulose. For the Wet specimens, this same ratio is clearly higher than 1, which implies that cellulose strains more during creep than wood itself. This finding allows to propose rheological models of the wood viscoelastic behavior...|$|R
40|$|A {{hierarchical}} modelling path of {{wood and}} wood composites' properties is presented. First the calculation model (WOOD 123) is developed for elastic and shrinkage behaviour based on the complex ultra-, micro- and macro-structure of wood, based on the properties of wood main constituents and their orientation. Then the results and the understanding obtained are utilised {{in the development of}} the calculation program for the analysis and design of transversely loaded layered wood composite plates (OptiPly). The model (WOOD 123) predicts the elastic and shrinkage properties of wood at the cell wall level and at the macro-level, where wood substances consist of earlywood, latewood and ray cells. The modelling of the cell wall properties and behaviour is based on the properties of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. At the cellular level wood substances consist of individual softwood cell types (earlywood, latewood and ray cells). Finally at the highest level of the cellular modelling, earlywood, latewood and ray cells are combined together to predict anisotropic <b>elastic</b> properties of <b>wood,</b> the effects of moisture content on the elastic properties and the nonlinear shrinkage in different directions. WOOD 123 model, developed by this author, has been the first model capable of building the full path from the ultra- and micro-scale material properties, polymer orientation and arrangement to the orthotropic behaviour of wood. Earlier models are limited only to the prediction of cell wall properties or the layered structure of cell wall is neglected and the behaviour of cellular wood substance is modelled using homogenous cell walls. Due to the lack of suitable micro-scale testing devices and inadequate microscopy facilities and due to the large number of structural and material property parameters required in the model as input data, the development and verification of the model have been done mainly based on the material and structural parameters obtained from the literature. The elastic properties, the dependence of the elastic properties on the moisture content {{of wood and}} the complex shrinkage behaviour calculated by the model agreed well with the elastic constants and material behaviour presented in the literature. Next step was the modelling of the behaviour of layered wood composites. For the development and verification of OptiPly-program large experimental work has been carried out. Tests contain plywood and LVL manufactured using birch and spruce veneers, different veneer thicknesses and special lay-ups, short- and long-term tests were performed and test methods varied from standard tests to more complex beam-type and point-loaded plate tests. The tests showed that the shear deformations in cross veneers have a strong effect on the deflections and the strength of wood composite plates. However, the conventional theory based on Love-Kirchoff hypothesis does not take into account pronounced shear deformations of cross layers. The accuracy of the classical theory and the generalised Bernoulli's hypothesis is compared. The calculation based on the exact solution of the generalised Bernoulli's hypothesis by Heinisuo correlates well with the test results. The accuracy of prediction of the mid span deflection obtained using the generalised Bernoulli's hypothesis is − 16 % … + 10 %, and by the classical lamination theory is − 26 % … + 13 %, respectively. OptiPly-program was found to be reliable, slightly conservative and suitable for the practical design of plywood plates. At this moment Finnish plywood and LVL industry uses OptiPly-program in practice. reviewe...|$|R
