He has appeared 38 times for Northern Ireland as a West Brom player, earning 48 caps in total. Jesse Pennington is the club's most capped England international, with 25 caps. The highest transfer fee paid by the club is £12million to Zenit Saint Petersburg for Salomón Rondón on 10 August 2015; the <b>deal</b> <b>could</b> rise to over £15million with appearance fee and other add-ons.

5|$|A {{couple of}} months after his draft, Johansen signed with Columbus to a three-year, {{entry-level}} contract on September 9, 2010. With a base salary of $900,000, the <b>deal</b> <b>could</b> have reached $1.975 million per year if he achieved all his bonus incentives. Attending his first NHL training camp that month, he {{did not make the}} Blue Jackets roster and was returned to Portland on October 2 for another year of junior hockey. Back in the WHL, Johansen was chosen to represent the league at the 2010 Subway Super Series, a six-game exhibition tournament featuring all-stars from the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) against Russian junior players. He completed the 2010–11 season improving to 92 points (40 goals and 52 assists) in 63 games, ranking seventh among league scorers.|$|E
5|$|On 22 July 2010, reports {{surfaced}} {{suggesting that}} English club Newcastle United {{were looking to}} sign Ben Arfa. After being questioned, Newcastle's manager Chris Hughton denied the reports. Five days later, Ben Arfa's agent declared that Newcastle were indeed interested in the player, along with German clubs Hoffenheim and Werder Bremen, Turkish club Galatasaray, and Italian club A.C. Milan. On 9 August, a season-long loan with an option to make the move permanent was reportedly being negotiated between the two clubs. However, a loan-fee for the <b>deal</b> <b>could</b> not be reached with Newcastle offering £650,000; £350,000 short of what Marseille wanted. On 12 August, Marseille president Jean-Claude Dassier announced that Ben Arfa would not be moving to Newcastle and even {{went as far as}} to say that an offer from the club had not even existed.|$|E

5|$|On July 25, 2013, a {{tentative}} deal was announced which {{will see a}} 20,000-25,000 seat stadium built at Buzzard Point costing $300 million. Following votes by the D.C. Council to approve the plan, it {{was signed into law}} on December 30, 2014. Under the July 2013 deal, the District of Columbia was to have obtained a portion of the necessary Buzzard Point property from the developer that owned it, in exchange for cash and a government building. D.C. United would kick the $150 million needed to construct the stadium on the city-owned land, which it would rent for 20 to 35 years. Under the deal as revised by D.C. City Council in December 2014, the city would instead pay fair market value for the developer's land, and use eminent domain if a <b>deal</b> <b>could</b> not be reached.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2010–11 season, Diarra was heavily linked with a move to the champions Marseille. On 14 July, Marseille manager Didier Deschamps {{confirmed}} that the club was negotiating with both Diarra and Bordeaux for a transfer. A week later, Bordeaux president Triaud stated that Marseille had failed to meet the player's €7.75million release clause and that Diarra was likely not going to be leaving the club. Despite Marseille remaining hopeful a <b>deal</b> <b>could</b> go through, on 30 July, a deal was declared dead. Diarra later stated that he was happy to remain at Bordeaux and see out the rest of his contract. The defensive midfielder opened the new campaign scoring two goals in the first six matches of the season in wins over Paris Saint-Germain and Lyon.|$|E
5|$|The Cacchios {{expressed}} a desire to sell the Theatre to the RTC rather than to developers, because the RTC consisted of friends of the family and other residents whom the Cacchios trusted to maintain and preserve the Theatre. To make the transfer of ownership easier, the Cacchios agreed to continue operating the Theatre until such a <b>deal</b> <b>could</b> be reached, and to assist in the operation of the Theatre after its sale to the RTC. By late February 2010 the RTC had raised $45,000, and needed to reach a total of $600,000. After a down payment of $160,000, and paying the full cost of the property, the remaining funds would cover renovations to the building. Over $8,000 was raised in a silent auction on February28. More than 100 people attended the auction, including Congressman Maurice Hinchey.|$|E

5|$|By the 1994 NBA All-Star Game, {{speculation}} as {{to whether}} or not the Timberwolves would remain in Minneapolis following the 1994–95 season became an issue. On February 11, 1994, NBA commissioner David Stern announced that he and his representatives would serve as mediators in an effort to resolve issues related to the debt owed on the Target Center, the Timberwolves home arena. The Timberwolves ownership was seeking a public or private entity to purchase the $73 million remaining on the arena's mortgage, otherwise the team would be sold and in all likelihood moved from Minnesota. Although mediation talks were just beginning to keep the team in place, by the following week it was revealed that ownership had met with representatives from San Diego, Nashville and New Orleans to discuss the potential relocation of the franchise. By late February, New Orleans emerged as the likely city for the team to relocate to if a <b>deal</b> <b>could</b> not be reached to keep the team in Minneapolis. This became the case after the potential ownership group Top Rank signed a letter of intent to purchase the team and move it to New Orleans if debt issues at the Target Center were not resolved.|$|E

While buying directly at the Haymarket required much more haggling than in a grocery, better <b>deals</b> <b>could</b> be had. Many of the early vendors were Italian and Lebanese immigrants.|$|R

It could also result in Wilson receiving a reduced sentence, possibly leading to his release based upon time already served. Wilson's lawyer, B.J. Bernstein, would not accept the proposed deal because it would require her client to plead guilty to a felony with a fifteen-year sentence, forcing him to register as a sexual offender for up to fifteen years.|$|E

On June 4, 2012, the Penguins signed goaltender Tomas Vokoun to a two-year contract after acquiring him from the Washington Capitals for a seventh-round draft pick in 2012. On June 28, 2012, the Penguins agreed to terms with All-Star center Sidney Crosby to a 12-year contract extension worth $104.4 million, but due {{to the terms of}} the current NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement, the new <b>deal</b> <b>could</b> not be signed until July 1, 2012.|$|E
