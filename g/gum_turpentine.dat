50|$|Pine tar can be {{used for}} {{preserving}} wooden boats (and other wood which will be exposed to the elements) by using a mixture of pine tar, <b>gum</b> <b>turpentine</b> and boiled linseed oil. First, a thin coat is applied using a mixture with a greater proportion of turpentine. This allows it to permeate deeper into the oakum and fibre of the wood and lets the tar seep into any pinholes and larger gaps that might be in the planks. The tar weeps out to the exterior and indicates where the boat needs the most attention. Having the solution in place and the repairs complete, the vessel is ready for the thicker standard mix. Pine tar is also efficacious for properly saturating lead or standard oakum so that the endurance of the sealing capacity is optimal. Such treatments, while effective, must be continually reapplied.|$|E

40|$|The {{hydration}} of α-pinene of <b>gum</b> <b>turpentine</b> and separately pinene fractions in {{the organic}} acids media {{for the purpose}} of obtaining terpene alcohols, which are widely used as flotation reagent for mineral processing in mining production were studied. The best results are obtained among the organic acids when 70 % formic acid is used. The α-pinene hydration process in the acid imedium is exothermic, and it is necessary to maintain a constant temperature of 65 °C to reduce the rate of side reactions. The main component of turpentine, resulting in the formation of α-terpineol is α-pinene; 3 -carene, terpinolene, and limonene contents do not practically change in the reaction mixture, which testify their stability in 70 % formic acid media. The maximum content of terpene alcohols (60, 1 %) was obtained when using α-pinene fraction at a ratio of α-pinene and 70 % formic acid 1. 0 : 1. 1 for 3 hours. Increase of the duration of hydration reaction leads to the decrease in the content of terpineol in the reactio n mixture due to the secondary isomerization processes...|$|E
40|$|Pinus species exhibit fast {{growth and}} are good {{producers}} of wood, cellulose and resin. Brazil {{is the second}} largest producer of resin. The People?s Republic of China is the main producer with approximately 90 % world?s resin production. Turpentine, volatile fraction, and rosin, solid fraction, are two major fractions or resin. The distillation process continues up to 170 ° C can be extracted about 95 % of the total <b>gum</b> <b>turpentine</b> resin, preserving its constituents. There is little research using thermal analysis to study pine resin properties. This work involved evaporating volatile fraction of resins in an oven at 170 ºC consisted of 20 different samples from Pinus caribaea var. hondurensis and was compared with results obtained in thermal analysis to quantify the same fraction for each one. The volatile fraction in the oven (170 ºC) was from 14. 69 % to 24. 05 %. This fraction obtained through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was from 13. 37 % to 23. 64 %. The results demonstrate that the TGA technique is capable of accurately determining the volatile and non-volatile fractions of the resin and this technical proved to be suitable for further analyses. 2014 CBRATEC...|$|E

40|$|Background: α-Pinene is an {{important}} natural product that is widely used in flavorings, fragrances, medicines, fine chemicals and high-density renewable fuels. Currently, α-Pinene used in industry is mainly produced either by tapping trees (<b>gum</b> <b>turpentine)</b> or as a byproduct of paper pulping (crude sulfate turpentine, CST). However, the extraction of it from trees is tedious and inefficient and requires substantial expenditure of natural resources. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} seek sustainable technologies for α-pinene production. Results: To construct the microbial synthetic pathway of α-pinene in E. coli, we co-expressed native geranyl diphosphate synthase (IspA) from E. coli and α-pinene synthase (Pt 30) from Pinus taeda, and then to increase the geranyl diphosphate (GPP) content in the cells, a suitable geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS 2) was selected from two different origins. Furthermore, to enhance α-pinene production, a novel biosynthetic pathway of α-pinene was assembled in E. coli BL 21 (DE 3) with the heterologous hybrid mevalonate (MVA) pathway, GPPS 2 and α-pinene synthase (Pt 30). The final genetic strain, YJM 28, harboring the above novel biosynthetic pathway of α-pinene, accumulated α-pinene up to 5. 44 mg/L and 0. 97 g/L under flask and fed-batch fermentation conditions, respectively. The conversion efficiency of glucose to α-pinene (gram to gram) in the metabolically engineered strain reached 2. 61 %. Conclusions: In this paper, by using metabolic engineering techniques, the more efficient biosynthetic pathway of α-pinene was successfully assembled in E. coli BL 21 (DE 3) with the heterologous hybrid MVA pathway, GPPS 2 and α-pinene synthase (Pt 30). In addition, this is the first report on α-pinene fed-batch fermentation, and our results represent improvements over previous reports...|$|E

40|$|<b>Turpentine</b> oils, <b>gum</b> oleoresins and rosins from Pinus merkusii Jungh et de Vrises were {{collected}} {{on the island of}} Sumatra and Java for investigation of their chemical composition. Gum oleoresins were separated into neutral and acidic fractions with an aqueous 4 % sodium hydroxide solution. The fractions containing turpentine oils and rosins were analyzed by Gas Chromatography (GC) and Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), respectively. The neutral fractions of <b>gum</b> oleoresins and <b>turpentine</b> oils mainly consisted of α-pinene, Δ- 3 -carene and β-pinene. A difference in chemical composition with locality was recognized for the turpentine oils and neutral fractions of gum oleoresins. While examining the chemical composition of the acidic fractions of gum oleoresins and rosins, we found that relative retention time could not be used to identify each resin acid. Based on mass spectral comparison, the major constituents of the acidic fractions and rosins were identified as sandaracopimaric acid, isopimaric acid, palustric acid, dehydroabietic acid, abietic acid, neoabietic acid and merkusic acid. The major component of the acidic fractions was palustric acid, while that of both rosin 1 and 2 was abietic acid. The chemical composition of the acidic fractions of gum oleoresins and rosins differed with locality. Using TC- 1 and TC- 5 columns, levopimaric acid could not be separated from rosins or acidic fractions of gum oleoresins of Indonesian Pinus merkusii. This is the first report that neither fraction contains levopimaric acid...|$|R
40|$|The work {{contains}} {{studies of}} the chemical composition of adducts {{on the basis of}} terpenoids and maleic anhydride to provide controlled synthesis {{on the basis of their}} secondary products with specified performance characteristics. The determination of the qualitative and quantitative composition of the mixtures of resin acids of pine turpentine and rosin by their methyl esters was performed with GLC analysis; the components of pine resin, rosin, turpentine, adducts was performed with NMR spectroscopy, functional groups in the original terpenoid resins and products of their interaction with oxygen-containing compounds (maleopimaric acid) and terpenoidmaleic adducts by the method of IR spectroscopy. Good convergence of the results obtained by NMR spectroscopy and GLC analysis on the composition of pine resin, <b>gum</b> rosin and <b>turpentine</b> confirms their authenticity. Using the obtained experimental and calculated data the composition of terpenoidmaleic adducts wasset. When obtaining resin terpenoidmaleic adducts, the composition of turpentine solution of resin varied in the range from 30 / 70 to 70 / 30 wt %, the calculated amount of maleic anhydride to link all resin acids with conjugated double bonds and terpene hydrocarbons varied from 57. 7 to 38. 3 wt %. It is shown that when modification of turpentine composition from 30 / 70 to 70 / 30 wt % with maleic anhydride increases, there is a significant change in the compositions of obtained terpenoidmaleic adducts of rosin. When comparing experimental data and theoretical calculations regularity is established in the change of composition of terpenoidmaleic of rosin adducts obtained from various terpentine: content of maleopimaric acid naturally increases with the increase of resin acids and the content of terpenoidmaleic adducts decreases. It is shown th at terpinoidmaleic adducts are multicomponent sys-tems composed of maleopimaric acid, terpinolene ad ducts, and of resin acids, which do not react with maleic anhydride. By varying the composition of the turpentine and the amount of maleic anhydride, adducts with different content components can be obtained, and hence, regulating their specifications. The efficiency of using the methods of NMR and IR spectroscopy to study the composition terpenoidmaleic adducts is demonstrated...|$|R
