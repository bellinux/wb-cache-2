25|$|Preparations {{are being}} made for the three guests to eat at the nearby golf club {{as it is the}} night off for the Elgins, Clarissa's married butler and cook. Sir Rowland congratulates Clarissa on her {{relationship}} with and handling of Pippa who had a bad time with her real mother, Miranda and her drug-supplying lover, Oliver Costello. A phone call to the house is strangely cut off when Clarissa tells the caller that she is not Mrs. Brown but Mrs. Hailsham-Brown. Clarissa tells Sir Rowland that the house used to belong to a Mr. Sellon, a now-deceased antique dealer in Maidstone and the furnishings are his. His former trade means that enquiries are received about some of his furniture, including one for the desk that, unbeknown to her, Jeremy had been searching through earlier. Walking <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation,</b> Pippa tells the two that she has found out that the desk has a secret drawer and she shows it to them together with its contents: an envelope with three autographed papers inside with the signatures of Queen Victoria, John Ruskin and Robert Browning on them.|$|E

Klotz replied at 20:46:03 that they could hold for five more minutes. The controller once again inquired as to their alternate airport and Klotz replied at 20:46:24, [...] "It was Boston but we can't do it now we, we, don't, we run out of fuel now." [...] A handoff controller listening <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> called the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control (NY TRACON) at 20:46:24 and advised the TRACON controller that Avianca Flight 52 could only hold for five more minutes. The handoff controller asked whether NY TRACON could take the flight or whether to send Avianca to its alternate airport. The NY TRACON controller replied, [...] "Slow him to one eight zero knots and I'll take him." [...] The handoff controller later testified that he had not heard Flight 52 say that they could no longer reach their alternate airport. At 20:46:47, the NY ARTCC radar controller cleared the flight to proceed to JFK at [...] and to slow to [...] Flight 52 departed the CAMRN holding pattern at 20:47.|$|E
50|$|Even those wilders who {{learn how}} to manage their {{abilities}} tend to do so at a price; they almost invariably {{have some sort of}} 'block' against using the One Power effectively, and without training, they are usually limited to one or two Talents they have discovered on their own. Most commonly, these women have learned how to listen <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversations</b> of others through a long-distance form of eavesdropping, or they have learned how to get what they want through a type of Compulsion. Some, however, learn to Heal, or predict the weather, or a number of other specialized skills, depending on their everyday occupation. They may not even realize that they are channeling when they do so, {{as was the case with}} Nynaeve al'Meara.|$|R
50|$|Between 1991 and 2001, Lacy staged The Oakland Projects, a {{community}} performance art project, with TEAM (Teens, Educators, Artists, Media Makers) members. The Oakland Projects aimed to engage local California youth in consciousness-raising discussions about police brutality, social injustice, education, {{and other social}} issues. Participants did not ‘perform’ in the traditional sense, but instead mirrored the social stereotypes that they see within in their community. <b>The</b> Roof is <b>On</b> Fire (1993-1994) was a two-year project in which Lacy and collaborators developed media literacy classes for Oakland youth, and conducted a one-night performance piece. More than 200 young people had conversations in cars about race, class, gender, inequality, and other issues. Observers were asked to listen <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversations.</b> <b>The</b> students trained in independent media created a documentary of the performance, which was covered on mainstream news stations.|$|R
25|$|Therese and Dominique had six {{children}}: Paul, Robert (born in 1923), Suzanne (1925), John (1926), Marie (1928) and Peter (1931). The Laxalt {{children were}} raised largely by their mother as Dominique spent {{long periods of}} time away from the household as he tended to his sheep in the deserts and mountains of Nevada. The children all helped Therese at The French Hotel. It was there that Paul first acquired an interest in politics as he listened <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversations</b> of <b>the</b> politicians who patronized the restaurant (including the legendary U.S. Senator Patrick McCarran). Paul played <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 1938 state basketball champion team at Carson High School before graduating and attending Santa Clara University. When World War II broke out, Paul joined the U.S. Army and served as a medic, seeing action in the Battle of Leyte in the Philippines. After the war, he graduated from the University of Denver (1949) law school.|$|R

6000|$|A fat, hairless, important-looking man joined this group, took a {{chair and}} planted it firmly with its back {{in the face of}} Kipps, a thing that {{offended}} Kipps mightily. [...] "Are you telling him," [...] gurgled the fat, hairless man, [...] "about dear Lady Jane's affliction?" [...] A young couple, lady brilliantly attired and the man in a magnificently cut frock coat, arranged themselves to the right, also with an air of exclusion towards Kipps. [...] "I've told him," [...] said the gentleman in a flat, abundant voice. [...] "My!" [...] said the young lady, with an American smile. No doubt they all thought Kipps was out of it. A great desire to assert himself in some way surged up in his heart. He felt he would like to cut <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> in some dramatic way. A monologue something in the manner of Masterman? At any rate, abandoning that as impossible, he would like to appear self-centred and at ease. His eyes, wandering over the black surfaces of a noble architectural mass close by, discovered a slot--an enamelled plaque of directions.|$|E

2500|$|Candace and Mitchell Aronson, Jewish {{next door}} neighbors of William and Dorothy Quigley, used a Radio Shack police scanner to listen <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{cordless}} telephone <b>conversations</b> of Mr.& Mrs. Quigley. When the Aronsons heard the Quigleys discuss {{a campaign to}} drive them from the neighborhood with [...] "Nazi scare tactics", the Aronsons contacted the Denver office of the ADL.

(The Quigleys later indicated that these remarks were not anti-Semitic, and were only intended to be sick humor.) Neither the Aronsons nor the ADL were aware that Congress had amended federal wiretap law which made it illegal to record conversations from a cordless telephone, to transcribe the material and to use the transcriptions for any purpose.|$|R
40|$|<b>In</b> her {{observation}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversations</b> between radio broadcasters, {{the writer}} {{did not find}} the same result with what Zimmerman and West have found <b>in</b> their study <b>on</b> turn taking irregularities. In <b>the</b> <b>conversations</b> between couples of radio broadcasters, the writer found the female radio broadcasters keep interrupting the males.

This research was qualitative research. The writer got <b>the</b> data from <b>conversations</b> between radio broadcasters. In her analysis, the writer classified the interruption into two types and categorized them based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sex of the speaker and the interlocutor. Then, she tabulated the number of interruption and overlap made by the male. Then, she made comparison between the interruption made by the males and the females. Finally, the writer found that the male radio broadcasters often made interruption, instead of overlap to their interlocutors both in same sex and mixed sex conversations. As a matter of fact, the females also did so. However, the number of interruption made by the females was greater than the one made by the males either in same sex or mixed sex <b>conversations.</b> In conclusion, <b>the</b> writer showed that her findings were not same with Zimmerman and West's...|$|R
40|$|Although {{everyday}} {{stories told}} {{in the course of}} ongoing conversations are as open to multiple readings as many literary texts, the participants in the conversational storytelling situation must assign a meaning to a given telling of a story in order to facilitate the absorption of the story into the state of general talk which normally obtains. In the present paper, work done by the American linguistic school of narrative analysis (as begun by Labov and Waletzky and further developed by the author of this paper) is brought together with insights into conversational storytelling from ethno-methodological conversation analysts (Sacks, Jefferson, etc.) The meaning of a given telling of a story is shown to derive from both the structure of the story as told and the process of interpretation which goes <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> after <b>the</b> telling. Special attention is paid to the «next story» which can follow the telling of a «first story» in a conversation. It is argued that the next story is crucially constrained by the first story, while the first story is assigned its meaning partially from the topic of the following one...|$|R

50|$|Twitter {{can be used}} to host interviews, {{referred}} to as a Twitterview. It is a type of interview for which the medium restricts the interviewer and interviewee to short-form responses.

40|$|As {{the kickoff}} to The Chicago Community Trust's Centennial, "On the Table 2015 " marked the {{beginning}} of a yearlong campaign to celebrate philanthropy in all its forms [...] giving of time, treasure and talent.

40|$|In the {{competition}} for the audience’s attention, TV journalism’s mode of address {{is becoming more and}} more important (Ben-Porath, 2007; Ekström, 2000), and interviews with politicians are without doubt a part of this devel-opment. With influences from more entertaining genres, established forms of political debates and interviews are redefined and new ones are produced (see e. g. Clayman, 2006; Lauerbach, 2004). Interviews taking place in front of a live studio audience might be seen as a sign of such change. In political interviews, the presence of a studio audience can be seen as an outcome of what Scannell (2003) describes as the management of liveness (see also Scannell, 1996; cf. Tolson, 2006 : 11 – 14), and the presence of an audience realizes several aims <b>on</b> <b>the</b> producer’s side. The studio audience is a visual resource, and, through its capability of producing collective reactions such as applause, cheering, laughter, an element which could bring about a vivacious and unplanned feel to the ongoing interview. However, audience reactions do not occur without reason. Of course, they could evidently be encouraged by the producer, which is often the case with applause at the beginning and end of programmes, but audiences also respond spontaneously to what goes <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation,</b> and these reactions become an integrated part of the interview. This also implies that both interviewer and interviewee relate to, and manage, the studio audience’s reaction as a resource in their questions and answers. Also, the sense of liveness which a studio audience might produce is aimed at the absent audience; it is a means to involve the viewers in the programme (cf. Thompson, 1995 : 104 – 5). The general ques-tion discussed in this article concerns the relationship between the manage-ment of studio audience reactions and its consequences for the mode of address of political interviews...|$|R
