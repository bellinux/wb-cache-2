5|$|Bratislava's dissidents {{anticipated}} the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>Communism</b> with the Bratislava candle demonstration in 1988, {{and the city}} {{became one of the}} foremost centres of the anti-Communist Velvet Revolution in 1989.|$|E
5|$|These elections, {{in which}} anti-communist {{candidates}} won a striking victory, inaugurated {{a series of}} peaceful anti-communist revolutions in Central and Eastern Europe that eventually culminated in the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>communism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the German-Soviet {{invasion}} of Poland in September 1939, President Ignacy Mościcki fled to Romania, taking the presidential insignia, including two specimens of the Banner of the Republic, with him. The banners were {{kept by the}} Polish government-in-exile in London until after the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>Communism</b> in Poland in 1989.|$|E

5|$|In 1978, Pope John Paul II, {{formerly}} Archbishop of Kraków in then-Communist Poland, {{became the}} first non-Italian pope in 455 years. His 27-year pontificate {{was one of the}} longest in history. Mikhail Gorbachev, the president of the Soviet Union, credited the Polish pope with hastening the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>Communism</b> in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Pilecki's {{place of}} burial has never been found but {{is thought to be}} somewhere within Warsaw's Powązki Cemetery. After the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>communism</b> in Poland a {{symbolic}} gravestone was erected in his memory at Ostrowa Mazowiecka Cemetery. In 2012, Powązki Cemetery was partially excavated in an effort to find Pilecki's remains.|$|E
5|$|After 1952 the Polish sport {{life was}} {{organized}} through the Polish Cultural and Educational Union. Through the communist era Polish minority declined demographically and this process continue to date, hence after the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>communism</b> in 1989 {{only a few}} sport organizations resumed their activity. Beskid Śląski, the only notable one, focuses on tourism. No exclusively Polish sport club exists today in Zaolzie.|$|E

50|$|After the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> the <b>communism</b> in 1989, {{construction}} {{continued for}} a short period, but it was finally stopped in 1993 {{due to lack of}} financial resources. Construction continued after 1998, the motorway being completed in late 2012.|$|R
5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century Białystok was an {{important}} center for light industry, which {{was the reason for}} the substantial growth of the city's population. The tradition continued with many garment factories established in the twentieth century, such as Fasty in the district of Bacieczki. However, after the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>communism</b> in 1989 many of these factories faced severe problems and subsequently closed down.|$|E
5|$|Since the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>communism</b> many {{privately funded}} {{institutions}} of higher educations have been founded and their number is still increasing. Currently Białystok is home to one principal public university (University of Białystok) and two other public specialist universities (Białystok Technical University and Medical University of Białystok). Some institutions, such as Musical Academy in Białystok, are branches of their parent institutions in other cities, usually in Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|A {{majority}} of multinational corporations find their origins in First World countries. After the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>communism,</b> multinational corporations proliferated as more countries focused on global trade. The series of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) {{and later the}} World Trade Organization (WTO) essentially ended the protectionist measures that were dissuading global trade. The eradication of these protectionist measures, while creating avenues for economic interconnection, mostly benefited developed countries, who by using their power at GATT summits, forced developing and underdeveloped countries to open their economies to Western goods.|$|E
50|$|Since the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Communism</b> in Hungary in 1989 Regnum could appear {{openly in}} the public life, and using its {{tradition}} and potential takes part in reevangelization of Hungary. In 2005 the Regnum Marianum has approximately 2500 members.|$|R
25|$|Poland {{has always}} been a very open country to new music genres and even before the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> the <b>communism,</b> music styles like rock, metal, jazz, electronic, and new wave were well-known. Since 1989, the Polish scene has {{exploded}} with new talents and a more diverse style.|$|R
50|$|Navigating between {{enthusiasm and}} {{disappointment}} during those troubled {{years following the}} <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> the <b>communism,</b> barely making ends meet, she survived {{with the help of}} friends and aid from the Writers' Union, before descending into chronic alcoholism and developing TB. Despite her misery and ills, she kept writing.|$|R
5|$|Another large {{organization}} was Polskie Towarzystwo Turystyczne ‘Beskid Śląski’ (Polish Tourist Association ‘Silesian Beskids’) established in 1910. Initially it focused on organizing the Polish tourist movement and building mountain huts in the Beskids but later widened its activities to skiing, football, athletics and volleyball. In the 1930s it associated 27 local branches. After World War II it operated half-legally and as Siła, was liquidated by Czechoslovak communist authorities after the Victorious February 1948. It resumed its activity again in 1991, after the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>communism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Approximately 600 Jews {{were killed}} in Greater Albania during the war. Albania-proper emerged from the war with a {{population}} of Jews eleven times greater than at the beginning, numbering around 1,800 individuals. Most of these subsequently emigrated to Israel, but several hundred remained until the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>Communism</b> in the early 1990s before they did the same. As of 2011, 69 Albanians have been recognized as Righteous Among the Nations for the role they played in saving Jews during the Holocaust.|$|E
5|$|In Russia, the Memorial Park Complex of the Heroes of the First World War {{was built}} {{on the site of the}} former Moscow City Fraternity Cemetery after the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>Communism,</b> opening in 2005 at a cost of 95 million roubles. The park {{includes}} 12 monuments, amongst which was the only surviving headstone from the cemetery and a new memorial chapel. In contrast, by the early 21st century, the numbers visiting the IJzertoren tower during the annual pilgrimages declined significantly as memories of the conflict faded.|$|E
40|$|After <b>falling</b> <b>of</b> <b>communism,</b> in Romania, {{different}} religious denominations came {{in order}} to find new followers. Most Roma in Romania are Orthodox Christians. Roma have generally adopted the religion of the country and they are strongly influenced by religious beliefs of the majority. The data show that the number of converted Roma people to these denominations, {{as a percentage of the}} total declared Roma ethnics is larger than the number of converted Romanians. For converted communities, several social implications have emerged: an increased birth rate, but also a positive decrease of crime rate. The article presents several communities as case studies for these conversions, based on qualitative data gathered in 2010 and draws conclusions upon social effects in these communities...|$|R
50|$|The {{programme}} Határok nélkül ("Without borders") {{was established}} after the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Communism,</b> {{focusing on the}} Hungarian diaspora living outside the present-day borders of Hungary due to the Treaty of Trianon. Subsidiaries of Magyar Rádió (MR) report from Bratislava, Uzhgorod, Arad, Târgu Mureș, Miercurea Ciuc, Oradea, Timișoara, Novi Sad, Subotica, Cluj-Napoca and Komárno.|$|R
50|$|Poland {{has always}} been a very open country to new music genres and even before the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> the <b>communism,</b> music styles like rock, metal, jazz, electronic, polka and new wave were well-known.

5|$|She {{listened to}} {{recordings}} of Balkan folk {{music as a}} child and became interested in the tradition. Later, she sang in and directed a Slavic chorus while an undergraduate at Yale University. She and some friends traveled to Eastern Europe in 1989, specifically Bulgaria and Bosnia, to study local musical customs. The recordings they made will be deposited in the Library of Congress. While Kostova was in Europe, the Berlin Wall collapsed, heralding the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>Communism</b> in Eastern Europe, events which shaped her understanding of history.|$|E
5|$|Suppressed {{during the}} era of {{communist}} Poland, after the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>communism</b> in Poland, Dmowski's legacy {{has begun to be}} more widely recognized. A bridge in Wrocław was named after him in 1992. In November 2006 statue of Roman Dmowski was unveiled in Warsaw; it had led to a series of protests from organizations which see Dmowski as fascist and opponent of tolerance; due to similar protests plans to raise statues or memorials elsewhere have commonly been delayed.|$|E
5|$|After the war Mazurkiewicz was persecuted by the Soviet-led {{communist}} {{authorities of}} the People's Republic of Poland, kept {{for two years}} in pre-trial jail, tortured and sentenced to life, {{despite the fact that he}} tried to cooperate with the new regime. He was rehabilitated after the end of the Stalinist period in 1956 and became active in the official veterans' organization Society of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy (ZBoWiD). He was eventually promoted to the rank of general of the Armed Forces of the People's Republic of Poland (LWP). He died shortly before the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>communism</b> in Eastern Europe.|$|E
50|$|Elsewhere, {{both within}} and without the West, {{democracy}} and capitalism were in the ascendant - even Communist holdouts like mainland China and (to a lesser extent) Cuba and Vietnam, while retaining one party government, experimented with market liberalisation, a process which accelerated after the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> European <b>Communism,</b> enabling the re-emergence of China as an alternative centre {{of economic and political}} power standing outside the West.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> Polish <b>communism</b> in 1989 [...] {{initiated}} a large {{increase in the}} immigration of Polish nationals to the United States that continues to this day. Many of the new immigrants settled in Pennsylvania, {{in areas such as}} the Port Richmond neighborhood of Philadelphia, and in the Brooklyn area of New York City, known as Greenpoint. Many Polish immigrants also immigrated to New Jersey and Connecticut.|$|R
25|$|Isac's legacy {{was touched}} by the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> Romanian <b>communism</b> during the 1989 Revolution. His {{memorial}} home was effectively disestablished in 2001, following an administrative decision of the Cluj County Council, and the cultural items in its patrimony were transferred to the Octavian Goga County Library. However, in autumn 2004, Isac {{was one of the}} contributors whose work was paid homage to in Steaua magazine's 50th anniversary issue.|$|R
5|$|In April 1941, Yugoslavia was {{occupied}} by Nazi Germany and Italy, the latter annexing or occupying the Croatian Littoral, although the armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces of World War II and the 1947 Treaty of Peace with Italy reversed wartime Italian territorial gains, awarding the entire region and adjacent territory to Yugoslavia and the Federal State of Croatia. After the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>communism,</b> Yugoslavia broke apart as Slovenia and Croatia declared independence in 1991. Although the region suffered an economic decline during the Croatian War of Independence, there was no fighting in the region.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, {{some social}} scientists, such as Zbigniew Brzezinski and Frank Gibney, refer to these changes as a revolution, one less {{dramatic}} than its Hungarian counterpart but one {{which may have}} had an even more profound impact on the Eastern Bloc. Timothy Garton Ash calls the Polish October the most significant event in the post-war history of Poland until the rise of Solidarity. History professor Iván T. Berend claims that while {{the effects of the}} Polish October on the Eastern Bloc may be disputed, it set the course for the eventual <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>communism</b> in the People's Republic of Poland.|$|E
5|$|Postwar Communist {{governments in}} Eastern Europe {{severely}} restricted religious freedoms. Although some priests and religious collaborated with Communist regimes, many were imprisoned, deported or executed and the Church {{was an important}} player in the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>Communism</b> in Europe. In 1949, Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War led to the expulsion of all foreign missionaries. The new government also created the Patriotic Church whose unilaterally appointed bishops were initially rejected by Rome before {{many of them were}} accepted. In the 1960s, the Cultural Revolution saw the closure of all religious establishments. When Chinese churches eventually reopened, they remained {{under the control of the}} Patriotic Church. Many Catholic pastors and priests continued to be sent to prison for refusing to renounce allegiance to Rome.|$|E
50|$|During the Socialist times, Békéscsaba {{became the}} county seat of Békés (1950) and began to develop {{into one of the}} most {{important}} centres of food industry of Hungary. After the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Communism</b> in 1989, the industry nearly collapsed and many people lost their jobs. However, today the crisis seems to be over and Békéscsaba remained one of the most important centers of the Hungarian food industry.|$|R

He was a deputee in the Contract Sejm and later in the Sejm of the Republic of Poland from 1991 to 1993.|$|R
40|$|In Romania, European Studies {{have been}} {{introduced}} relatively late compared with other European countries. Immediately after the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Communism,</b> Romanian Universities made efforts to introduce the European dimension in their curricula. The first specializations of European Studies date {{from the middle of}} the 90 th. Today, the Romanian Higher Education in the field of European Studies respects the European standard and provides courses at European level. ...|$|R
