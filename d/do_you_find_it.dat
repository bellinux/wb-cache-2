2500|$|... "Wolf fence" [...] algorithm: Edward Gauss {{described}} this simple but very useful and now famous algorithm in a 1982 article for communications of the ACM as follows: [...] "There's one wolf in Alaska; how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>it?</b> First build a fence {{down the middle}} of the state, wait for the wolf to howl, determine which side of the fence it is on. Repeat process on that side only, until you get to the point where you can see the wolf." [...] This is implemented e.g. in the Git version control system as the command git bisect, which uses the above algorithm to determine which commit introduced a particular bug.|$|E

"And {{coming to}} look at that paper at your full leisure and convenience--all in good time, for you're not curious to read it, and why should you be?--what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> to be but a will, you see. That's the drollery of it," [...] said Mr. Bucket with the same lively air of recalling a joke for the {{enjoyment}} of Mr. Smallweed, who still had the same crest-fallen appearance of not enjoying it at all; [...] "what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> to be but a will?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Rightbody {{suspected}} that [...] "something," [...] and asked sharply, [...] "And pray how <b>did</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> out? <b>You</b> <b>did</b> {{not speak of}} it in the valley." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{started at}} the word [...] "ambitious." [...] He repeated, [...] "No. What made you think of ambition? Who is ambitious? I know I am: but how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> out?" ...|$|R

60|$|You further charge us {{with being}} disunionists. If {{you mean that}} it is our aim to {{dissolve}} the Union, I for myself answer that it is untrue; for those who act with me I answer that it is untrue. Have you heard us assert that as our aim? Do {{you really believe that}} such is our aim? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> in our platform, our speeches, our conventions, or anywhere? If not, withdraw the charge.|$|E
6000|$|Well, {{that old}} etymology--what a lesson {{it is against}} certain gloomy, austere, ascetic people, that have gone about as if this world were all a dismal-prison house! It has, indeed, got all the ugly things in it that I have been {{alluding}} to; {{but there is an}} eternal sky over it, and the blessed sunshine, verdure of spring, and rich autumn, and all that in it, too. Piety does not mean that a man should make a sour face about things, and refuse to enjoy in moderation what his Maker has given. Neither <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> to have been so with old Knox. If you look into him you will find a beautiful Scotch humour in him, as well as the grimmest and sternest truth when necessary, {{and a great deal of}} laughter. We find really some of the sunniest glimpses of things come out of Knox that I have seen in any man; for instance, in his [...] "History of the Reformation," [...] which is a book I hope every one of you will read--a glorious book.|$|E
5000|$|According to Alex Jacobs, Gerald Vizenor (Anishinaabe) in his 1988 novel, The Trickster of Liberty, {{based his}} {{character}} Homer Yellow Snow on Jamake Highwater. He notes that Yellow Snow says to his Native audience: “If you knew who <b>you</b> were, why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> {{so easy to}} believe in me? … {{because you want to}} be white, and no matter what you say in public, you trust whites more than you trust Indians, which is to say, you trust pretend Indians more than real ones.” ...|$|R

No such report has reached us here, and no such report was known in the village, when I sent to make inquiries there on Mrs. Catherick's account. She certainly brought this poor little dog {{with her when she}} came, and I saw it trot out after her when she went away. I suppose the creature strayed into the plantations, and got shot. Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>it,</b> Miss Halcombe?" ...|$|R

And then {{suddenly}} altering her tone she went on, [...] "Now, Cuthbert, you will surely {{tell me what}} you would not before. What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> out? <b>It</b> is something about my father, I am sure." ...|$|R
6000|$|In the end, he behaved very handsomely. He dressed Flavia out to kill, as he said, in lace hoods and {{embroidered}} long-clothes, {{for which}} he tossed over half the ready-made stock of the great dry-goods stores; and he made Marcia get herself a new suit throughout, with a bonnet to match, which {{she thought she could}} not afford, but he said he should manage it somehow. In Equity he spared no pains to deepen the impression of his success in Boston, and he was affable with everybody. He hailed his friends across the street, waving his hand to them, and shouting out a jolly greeting. He visited the hotel office and the stores to meet the loungers there; he stepped into the printing-office, and congratulated Henry Bird on having stopped the Free Press and devoted himself to job-work. He said, [...] "Hello, Marilla! Hello, Hannah!" [...] and he stood a good while beside the latter at her case, joking and laughing. He had no resentments. He stopped old Morrison on the street and shook hands with him. [...] "Well, Mr. Morrison, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> as easy to get Hannah's wages advanced nowadays as you used to?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "DEAR MISS ANDERSON,--I {{have been}} acting on your parting advice {{to look out}} for that Mr. Lafflin of mine, and I have {{discovered}} that he is an unmitigated scamp. Consequently there is nothing more to keep me in Washington, and I should now like your advice about coming to Fortress Monroe. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> malarial? On the boat your aunt asked me to come, but you said nothing about it, and I was left to suppose that you did not think it would agree with me. Do you still think so? or what do you think? I know you think it was uncalled for and in extremely bad taste for me to tell you what I did the other day; and I have thought so too. There is only one thing that could justify it--that is, I think it might justify it--if you thought so. But I do not feel sure {{that you would like to}} know it, or, if you knew it, would like it. I've been rather slow coming to the conclusion myself, and perhaps it's only the beginning of the end; and not the conclusion--if there is such a difference. But the question now is whether I may come and tell you what I think it is--justify myself, or make things worse than they are now. I don't know that they can be worse, but I think I should like to try. I think your presence would inspire me.|$|E
6000|$|What! Do you wish, asks some one, {{a little}} contemptuously, {{to measure the}} great growing nineteenth century by the thumb-rule of Alexander Pope? No. But to measure the men who write {{in the nineteenth century}} by a man who wrote in the eighteenth; to compare their {{advantages}} with his, their circumstances with his: and then, if possible, to make them ashamed of their unmanliness. Have you young poets of this day, your struggles, your chagrins? Do you think the hump-backed dwarf, every moment conscious at once of his deformity and his genius--conscious, probably, of far worse physical shame than any deformity can bring, [...] "sewed up in buckram every morning, and requiring a nurse like a child"--caricatured, lampooned, slandered, utterly without fault of his own--insulted and rejected by the fine lady whom he had dared to court in reality, after being allowed and allured to flirt with her in rhyme--do you suppose that this man had nothing to madden him--to convert him into a sneering snarling misanthrope? Yet was there one noble soul who met him who did not love him, or whom he did not love? Have you your doubts? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> difficult to make your own speculations, even your own honest convictions, square with the popular superstitions? What were your doubts, your inward contradictions, to those of a man who, bred a Papist, and yet burning with the most intense scorn and hatred of lies and shams, bigotries and priestcrafts, could write that [...] "Essay on Man"? Read that, young gentlemen of the Job's-wife school, who fancy it a fine thing to tell your readers to curse God and die, or, at least, to show the world in print how you could curse God by divine right of genius, if you chose, and be ashamed of your cowardly wailings.|$|E

50|$|He is {{in favor}} of {{controls}} on immigration. He was the promoter of a law that toughens conditions of political asylum in France. He believes that France has a right to expel or welcome immigrants on a discretionary basis, citing as evidence the high unemployment and criminality rates of foreigners. He also points to the geographical concentration of foreigners in a small amount of towns as evidence that they are not integrated in the country. As he declared in the newspaper Le Parisien on the 8 November 2007:"France has the right to choose which immigrants it can accommodate... Let's muster the courage to face our problems! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> normal that 60% of immigrants are concentrated in only 3 of our 22 regions? That the unemployment rate of these people is 22% and that their children are dropping out of school? No, we will not accept this.".|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} transformations in {{libraries}} {{in at least}} three areas over the past number of years. First, in the area of service there is a transformation from users coming to the library to a model of the library reaching out to users. Secondly, in the area of collection building there is a transformation from ownership to access. Thirdly, there is a transformation in the need for digitization and preservation of materials – including materials that may require digitization. Steve Schafer’s session will focus on digital collections and will help answer two questions: 1. What’s out there? 2. How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>it...</b>|$|E
