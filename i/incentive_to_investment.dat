40|$|The {{literature}} {{on the relationship between}} exchange rate and investment mainly focus on the devaluation argument, which evidences that a devaluation may affect positively investment spending. The goal {{of this paper is to}} extend the analysis to how exchange rate variability can influence firm’s innovation process. Employing a large panel of Italian firms we estimate the impact of exchange rate on investment. Combining an ECM model specification with a model of signal extraction we find that exchange rate volatility reduces investment, with a decreasing sensitivity the greater is firm market power. A stable exchange rate is then an <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> <b>investment</b> as it allows more reliable estimation of its marginal productivity. To this extent, an economic system may benefit from a stable exchange rate in terms of investment and profit, provided it is able to strengthen its firm market power...|$|E
40|$|Foreign {{investment}} in Vietnam by U. S. investors has been controversial since {{the termination of}} the Vietnam War. Originally, there were political considerations. The idea of conducting business with a socialist government, that was an enemy in the recent past, was antithetical to the U. S. Congress and population. The trade embargo imposed on Vietnam was a reflection of this sentiment. In the meantime other nations were willing {{to negotiate with the}} new government because business considerations out-weighed political ideals. Vietnam proved to be a wealth of natural resources, most notably oil and gas reserves. There was also speculation that Vietnam 2 ̆ 7 s economy would grow {{in the same manner as}} its regional neighbors. Political pressure not to conduct business with Vietnam soon changed to political pressure to allow business with Vietnam. Now the controversy is whether the Vietnamese legal framework can support a free market economy and whether Vietnam will ride out the financial crisis of the region. The 1995 amendment to the Law repealed the land use right as an <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> <b>investment.</b> This alters control versus risk factors for choosing an investment vehicle. The Build-Operate-Transfer (2 ̆ 2 BOT 2 ̆ 2) is the least risk prone investment vehicle for FDI in the oil and gas industry in Vietnam. The BOT offers the greatest investor control of management and thus a higher success rate and greater profits for the project over the long term...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} optimal {{contract}} between a risk-averse manager {{and the initial}} shareholders in a two-period model where the manager. s investment effort, carried out in period 1, and her current effort, carried out in period 2, both impact the second-period profit, so {{that it may be}} difficult to disentangle the incentives for these two types of effort. The contract stipulates (a) the profit-contingent cash remuneration for each period, (b) the number of shares that will be granted to the manager at the end of the first period and (c) the restrictions (if any) on the sales of the granted stock. We show that stock grants play different roles according to whether the signal of investment effort is less noisy, or noisier, than that of current effort. In the former case, at the optimal solution, the firm gives more <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> <b>investment</b> effort than to period 2 current effort, and there is no need to restrict the sales of granted stocks: the stock grants then serve as an incentive device for investment effort, and it is efficient to permit the manager to sell all her shares to eliminate her dividend risks. In the latter case, the efficient contract does not allow the manager to sell her granted stock, and both current and investment efforts are given the same incentive. In this case, stock grants play a different role: they serve as commitment device to overcome the time-inconsistency problem. We determine simultaneously the optimal stock grants and the optimal restrictions on sales of shares...|$|E

40|$|The drive {{towards the}} {{electronic}} commerce organisation {{is both a}} troublesome and a strifted path for government, enterprises and consumers worldwide. In this article we analyse the evolution of electronic commerce in Denmark during the period 1995 - 1998 from four perspectives: regulation, standards, transportation media and business integration. The Danish government is stimulating the use of electronic commerce using direct and indirect policy initiatives on central, governmental regulation and establishment of greens enabling self-regulation. Also, the governments own, organisational management is in Denmark seen {{as a mean to}} exalt electronic commerce. Onwards, the fist on proprietary standards and the UN/EDIFACT is an ongoing source of delaying, stimulating or reventing electronic commerce depending on the business sector and the size of market actor addressed. In Denmark, the direct access and value added network supporters have so far been the dominating mean to transport the electronic documents in the business transaction. The Internet and XML technology is {{at the turn of the}} century challenging the way of doing business within this field. Some view this as the big blue to speed the diffusion of electronic commerce; others are worried that the <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> <b>investment</b> and pull the partners in the value chain to use EDI might be lost. Finally, our study conclude that the debate on business integration issues is ambiguous and characterised by substantial uncertainty on for example the role of intermediates, direct sale, hyper-shift in business partners and the pull/push of global enterprises at the local markets...|$|E
40|$|There {{is concern}} in many jurisdictions that firms found to enjoysubstantial market power may be under a special {{responsibility}} to grant to their competitors access to essential facilities. Where a firm enjoying market power has some asset which a new entrant to a concentrated market must have or use {{it is tempting}} to say that the market would operate better if the new comer were entitled to access. On a static analysis this may be true - there will be one more firm in the market: probably more will be produced and sold at lower prices. On a dynamic analysis however {{it is important that the}} incentive to create the original asset be not reduced The reduction in the incentive to invest in other specific facilities in other industries may be more important than the static improvement in a particular market. I am concerned by the propensity of antitrust authorities to take the staticview and require access to be granted at a price at which the incumbent wouldprefer not to deal thereby reducing the incentive to the original investment. The particular investment will already have been made but if antitrust authorities frequently compel access for the benefit of free riders wishing to compete downstream the <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> <b>investment</b> in facilities essential to other activities will be reduced. New Zealand competition law was inspired directly by that of Australia as part of the arrangements for the CER and in its turn the Australian trade practices legislation was largely inspired by the experience in the US and European Community. 2 Under s. 2 of the Sherman Act in the USA some of the cases went veryfar in finding that a firm with substantial market power was under a duty to grant access to essential facilities for the benefit of those wishing to compete with it downstream. Professor Areeda's seminal article `Essential Facilities: an Epithet in Need of Limiting Principles' 3 has helped to stem the tide. Even where more than one person can conveniently use the facility there are objections to requiring access. An obligation to supply not only reduces the incentive to make the original investment it also reduces the incentive to duplicate or improve it where this would otherwise be sensible. Moreover some body will have to settle the amount of compensation to be paid often on a continuing basis...|$|E
40|$|Electricity {{markets are}} being liberalised {{and open to}} private {{competition}} in several countries. These liberalized electricity markets are very complex as the interactions between demand and supply are subject to several technicalities arising from the commodity being traded: electricity. One of these technicalities is that generators cannot store electricity: this fact implies {{that it needs to}} generate its production real-time. A second problem with this market are the different generation technologies used at different levels of demand, which implies that at different times of the day different generation costs are supported to meet demand: due to ramp-rate constraints, capacity available, and fixed and start-up costs. In this paper we analyze the issue of investment and the electricity system’s long-term security in an industry where a regulator controls the short-term prices, imposing a perfect competition outcome for â€œlowâ€ demand hours and a price cap at times where load is shed. We look at the following research questions: a) How does the oligopolistic structure of the market interact with the value of the different technologies? b) How do players define their investment strategies? c) How do the regulatory policies affect the investment in generation? Do they work similarly under perfect competition and oligopoly? d) Can markets invest enough capacity to ensure the long run security of the market? The main results of our analysis are following: 1. The impact of a given investment on the market price is independent of the player investing. 2. The impact of an investment on price {{is a function of the}} technology in which the investment takes place and of the cycle to which the price refers to. 3. The impact of price caps on the evolution of the market structure is non-linear, it cannot be too low or too high. 4. An oligopolistic electricity market fails to deliver the needed investment unless the regulators intervene. 5. The higher the reserve margin the higher the total investment. However, this instrument by itself was not able to provide the incentive needed to ensure the long-term security of the system, as in any of the experiments analyzed the peak demand is not completely satisfied. 6. Even a slight increase in demand, due to the reserve margin, leads to important changes on the relative value of the different technologies. 7. The main task of the regulatory authorities is to define a level of capacity payments that give the necessary <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> <b>investment,</b> at the minimum cost: Capacity Payments are very important in shaping the generation structure. 8. Uncertainty reduces the value of Peak plants: this result clearly contradicts any common sense in these matters, as one would expect the presence of price uncertainty to be beneficial to Peak plants. The proportion invested in baseload plants increases with uncertainty of the energy price, decreasing the investment in shoulder plant. agent-based, electricity markets, evolution, investment, regulation, simulation...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to review the {{literature}} that investigates the relationship among unfunded social security systems, individual <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> <b>investments</b> in human capital and economic growth. Several endogenous growth models study investments in education in economies in which there are old age pension transfers. In this perspective, both individual choices about consumption and saving and decisions about education of children are correlated each other in processes of intergenerational and intertemporal choice. Public transfers for education (to the young generation) and pensions play an important role in the economic growth since they have a great influence on physical and human capital accumulation. Hence, this paper suggest that pay-as-you-go system should be redesigned to achieve its usual intertemporal and intergenerational redistributive function and to play an important role in providing stronger <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> human capital <b>investments</b> of young generations.

However, they find that education contributes little to this discrimination. A study by Bhaumik and Chakrabarty (2008) using two rounds of the NSSO’s employment-unemployment survey finds that the gender wage gap narrowed considerably between years 1987 and 1999. The narrowing of the earnings gap was attributed largely to a rapid increase in the returns to the labor market experience of women.|$|R
