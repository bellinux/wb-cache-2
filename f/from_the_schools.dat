25|$|Formation of new towns {{carved out}} of older ones was not unique to Maynard. Near-by Hudson, with its cluster of leather {{processing}} and shoe-making mills, seceded from Marlborough and Stow in 1866. In fact, the originally much larger Stow formed in 1683 lost land to Harvard, Shirley, Boxborough, Hudson and Maynard. The usual reason to petition the State's Committee on Towns was that a fast-growing population cluster - typically centered around mills - was too far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools,</b> churches and Meeting Hall of the parent town.|$|E
25|$|Directed by the Cultural Revolutionary Headquarters {{and later}} by the Supreme Cultural Revolution Council, the {{revolution}} initially closed universities for three years (1980–1983) and after reopening banned many books and purged thousands of students and lecturers <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools.</b> The cultural revolution sometimes involved violence in taking over the university campuses. Higher education in Iran had many leftist forces who were opposed to Ayatollah Khomeini's Islamic state in Iran. The resistance of Khomeiniist control at many universities was largely unsuccessful. How many students or faculty were killed is not known.|$|E

Carolina now holds a 17–15 lead in the yearly competition.|$|E
25|$|In 1913, {{during the}} early part of the colonial era, there were {{virtually}} no Christians in the Somali territories, with only about 100–200 followers coming <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> and orphanages of the few Catholic missions in the British Somaliland protectorate. There were also no known Catholic missions in Italian Somaliland during the same period. In the 1970s, during the reign of Somalia's then Marxist government, church-run schools were closed and missionaries sent home. There has been no archbishop in the country since 1989, and the cathedral in Mogadishu was severely damaged during the civil war. In December 2013, the Ministry of Justice and Religious Affairs also released a directive prohibiting the celebration of Christian festivities in the country.|$|E

25|$|In Thrace {{today there}} are 235 {{minority}} primary schools, where education is in the Greek and Turkish languages, {{and there are also}} two minority secondary schools, one in Xanthi and one in Komotini, where most of the minority is concentrated. In the remote mountainous areas of Xanthi where the Pomak element is dominant, the Greek government has set up Greek language secondary education schools in which religious studies is taught in Turkish and the Quran is taught in Arabic. The Pomak language (which is essentially considered a dialect of Bulgarian), however, is not taught at any level of the education system. The government finances the transportation to and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> for students who live in remote areas, and in the academic year 1997-98, approximately 195,000 USD was spent on transportation.|$|E
25|$|About {{one-quarter of}} the poems in the Carmina Burana are {{accompanied}} in the manuscript by music using unheighted, staffless neumes, an archaic system of musical notation {{that by the time}} of the manuscript had largely been superseded by staffed neumes. Unheighted neumes only indicate whether a given note is pitched higher or lower than the preceding note, without giving any indication of how much change in pitch there is between two notes, so they are useful only as mnemonic devices for singers who are already familiar with the melody. However, it is possible to identify many of those melodies by comparing them with melodies notated in staffed neumes in other contemporary manuscripts <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> of Notre Dame and Saint Martial.|$|E
25|$|Aside <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools,</b> {{the other}} 'traditional powerhouse' of rugby in Scotland was the {{universities}}, {{and to this}} day the Scottish universities have their own league system independent of the BUCS system which covers the rest of Great Britain. However, the BUCS Scottish Conference comprises divisions of four or five teams, and therefore not many fixtures each season, so unofficial Saturday University Leagues are organised (somewhat informally) between the universities. As well as having their own leagues the universities often compete in the SRU league structure and cup competitions to a high standard, most notably in 2007–08 Aberdeen University became the first university side to make the SHE SRU finals day winning the Plate competition. The significance of the universities to the history of the SRU is evident when it is noted that four of the oldest 17 SRU affiliated clubs are university teams.|$|E

25|$|It was in {{the power}} of the court to lessen or {{increase}} the severity of the niddui. The court might even reduce or increase the number of days, forbid all intercourse with the offender, and exclude his children <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> and his wife from the synagogue, until he became humbled and willing to repent and obey the court's mandates. According to one opinion, the apprehension that the offender might leave the Jewish fold on account of the severity of the excommunication did not prevent the court from adding rigor to its punishments so as to maintain its dignity and authority (Shulkhan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah, 334, 1, Rama's gloss, citing Sefer Agudah). This opinion is vehemently contested by the Taz (ibid.), who cites earlier authorities of the same opinion (Maharshal; Maharam; Mahari Mintz) and presents proof of his position from the Talmud. Additionally, the Taz notes that his edition of the Sefer Agudah does not contain the cited position.|$|E
25|$|As {{in western}} New York, the storm struck {{suddenly}} {{during the day}} Friday, with zero visibility, and blowing and drifting snow making roads impassable, and stranding many vehicles. Looting of radios from abandoned cars, as well as looting of soda pop from a truck was reported. Friday night, 250people were stranded in the International Nickel Company plant in Port Colborne. Although schools closed when informed of the impending storm, the rapid onset of the storm resulted in about 1,000 students being stranded overnight, January 28, in Port Colborne and Wainfleet schools (about 2,000 students were stranded in the Niagara region altogether). By Saturday, January 29, night at 6 p.m., 800 students were still trapped, with 600 of them in Wainfleet and Port Colborne. On Sunday, the remaining students were taken <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> {{with the help of}} the militia; some students were housed in nearby houses. In some areas, buses had become stranded trying to take children home from school Friday, so bus drivers took the children to nearby houses.|$|E

500|$|Although early opponents {{suggested}} the Pūnana Leo schools would harm students' academic development, graduates <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> have achieved several measures of academic success in later life. This is true {{despite the fact}} that the emphasis of the schools is on language revitalization rather than academic achievement: [...] "Immersion students have garnered prestigious scholarships, enrolled in college courses while still in high school, and passed the state university's English composition assessments, despite receiving the majority of their English, science and mathematics instruction in Hawaiian. Student achievement on standardised tests has equalled... surpassed that of Native Hawaiian children enrolled in English language schools, even in English language arts [...]" [...] These academic benefits come in addition to language revitalization and an increased realization of cultural pride.|$|E
500|$|As England became {{increasingly}} mercantilist and secularist, the humanist educational {{values of the}} Renaissance, which had enshrined scholasticism, came to be regarded by many as irrelevant. Following in the intellectual tradition of Francis Bacon, who had challenged the cultural authority of the classics, reformers such as Locke, and later Philip Doddridge, argued against Cambridge and Oxford's decree that [...] "all Bachelaur and Undergraduats in their Disputations should lay aside their various Authors, such that caused many dissensions and strifes in the Schools, and only follow Aristotle and those that defend him, and take their Questions from him, and that they exclude <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Schools</b> all steril and inane Questions, disagreeing from the antient and true Philosophy [...]" [...] Instead of demanding that their sons spend all of their time studying Greek and Latin texts, {{an increasing number of}} families began to demand a practical education for their sons; by exposing them to the emerging sciences, mathematics, and the modern languages, these parents hoped to prepare their sons for the changing economy and, indeed, for the new world they saw forming around them.|$|E
