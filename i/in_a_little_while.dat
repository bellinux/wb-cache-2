500|$|Crabtree {{made his}} {{observations}} using a similar set-up but had insufficient {{time to make}} any measurements, as it was cloudy in Broughton, and thus he only saw the transit briefly. According to Horrocks: [...] "Rapt in contemplation he stood for some time, scarcely trusting his own senses, through excess of joy... <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while,</b> the clouds again obscured {{the face of the}} Sun, so that he could observe nothing more than that Venus was certainly on the disc at the time." [...] Afterwards, he made [...] "so rapid a sketch" [...] of Venus as it had passed across the Sun's disc, allowing Crabtree to estimate the angular size of Venus to be 1' 3", accurate to within 1 second of arc of its actual size; Horrocks's estimate of 1' 12" [...] was less accurate.|$|E

500|$|Other reviews were mixed. Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan {{wrote that}} [...] "Keith himself is {{responsible}} {{for all of the}} album's good moments. Even when he's in unhinged-rant mode, Keith's imagery often remains lucid. And so the album's best song is [...] "Ants," [...] where he comes off frantic but omnipotent...It's dense and fascinating stuff, a tantalizing glimpse of what might've happened if Keith hadn't treated the reemergence of his most popular persona like an easy payday." [...] PopMatters writer Michael Frauenhofer wrote that [...] "The Return of Dr. Octagon is still better than anything Kool Keith's done <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while,</b> but apart from its best tracks, it's not close to the level of his finest work of the past, and it doesn't really build much on the legend of Dr. Octagon, which still rests most firmly on the good doctor's debut." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jimmy Jacobs, who co-managed Mike Tyson, used a {{synchronizer}} {{to measure}} young Ali's punching speed versus Sugar Ray Robinson, a welter/middleweight who was considered pound-for-pound the best fighter in history. Ali was 25% faster than Robinson, even though Ali was 45–50pounds heavier. Ali's punches produced approximately 1,000pounds of force. [...] "No matter what his opponents heard about him, they didn't realize how fast he was {{until they got}} in the ring with him", Jacobs said. The effect of Ali's punches was cumulative. Charlie Powell, who fought Ali early in Ali's career and was knocked out in the third round, said: [...] "When he first hit me I said to myself, 'I can take two of these to get one in myself.' But <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> I found myself getting dizzier and dizzier every time he hit me. He throws punches so easily that you don't realize how much they hurt you until it's too late." ...|$|E

We're still in the R phase and working out what the features will be, but it will be announced <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> and we’re really excited. In the same was as in , you have the Controlinator and you can remap the controls, you'll {{be able to do the}} same thing with Move. It'll also allow the community to make their own Move games and that's very cool." [...] A software update allowing users to play the game using PlayStation Move was released in September 2011. A premium DLC pack titled Rise of the Cakeling was released shortly after and added new story levels and tools for creators enabling them to create PlayStation Move games.|$|E

2500|$|In 1901, Blue Horse {{attended}} the Pan-American Exposition, a World’s Fair held in Buffalo, New York, from May 1 through November 2, 1901. Blue Horse {{was one of}} the major leaders of Colonel Fred T. Cummins Indian Congress and Wild West Show. Dr. N.W. Wilson, the health officer for the exposition, reported an incident involving [...] Blue Horse and his wife, Council Fire Woman. “One day I found myself suddenly famous among the Indians as a wonder worker fit in rank with the best of their medicine men. The squaw of Blue Horse tumbled over in a faint one afternoon and she was carried into her tepee. The Indians said she was dead. I applied restoratives and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> she was alright. Now Blue Horse is a big civil chief in the Sioux Nation, and his wife is of some consequence in Sioux society. So when the Indians saw her come back to life after apparent death, they gave me credit for having worked a miracle. Blue Horse himself believed it and circulated the story.” Blue Horse was so grateful that Dr. Wilson was conferred an honorary degree of medicine man and given the name of “He-Wakes-Them-Up” in a great ceremony at the council house.|$|E
2500|$|On September 13, 1920, Pickford {{gave his}} account of that night to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked {{airplane}} seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to me {{to find out what}} was in the bottle. I picked it up and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They told me she had swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told me she had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But I knew she was dying.She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how she was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while,</b> don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. I held her in my arms and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.|$|E
