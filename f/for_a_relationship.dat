5|$|All of Godwin's {{books written}} from 1970 to 1990 are fictional stories based on themes taken from Godwin's life. Her early works focus on women hoping <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> {{with a male}} companion, {{but at the same}} time wanting {{independence}} and freedom. The main protagonist is often restricted by family, tradition and patriarchy. Most of Godwin's early works include a prominent mother-daughter relationship as well.|$|E

5|$|The {{indigenous}} rodents of Madagascar, the Nesomyinae, {{prior to}} the discovery of Monticolomys comprised seven very distinctive genera—so distinct from each other that some have found it difficult to accept that they are closely related. Monticolomys, however, does not follow this pattern, in that it is similar and closely related to the gerbil-like genus Macrotarsomys of western Madagascar. This relationship was originally proposed by Goodman and Carleton based on morphology, and was strongly supported by a DNA sequence analysis (based on the cytochrome b gene) published in 1999. While this study provided some weak support <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> between the Macrotarsomys–Monticolomys clade and the giant jumping rat, Hypogeomys, a later study based on the IRBP gene instead placed Macrotarsomys–Monticolomys sister to a clade containing four other nesomyine genera—Eliurus, Voalavo, Gymnuromys, and Brachytarsomys.|$|E
5|$|Each summer (June, July, and August in the US), the {{producers}} would outline the storylines for the subsequent season. Before an episode went into production, Kauffman and Crane would revise the script written by another writer, mainly if something concerning either the series or a character felt foreign. Unlike other storylines, the idea <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> between Joey and Rachel was decided on {{halfway through the}} eighth season. The creators did not want Ross and Rachel to get back together so soon, and while looking for a romantic impediment, a writer suggested Joey's romantic interest in Rachel. The storyline was incorporated into the season; however, when the actors feared that the storyline would make their characters unlikable, the storyline was wrapped up, until it again resurfaced in the season's finale. For the ninth season, the writers were unsure {{about the amount of}} storyline to give to Rachel's baby, as they wanted the show neither to revolve around a baby nor pretend there to be none. Crane said that it took them a while to accept the idea of a tenth season, which they decided to do because they had enough stories left to tell to justify the season. Kauffman and Crane would not have signed on for an eleventh season, even if all the cast members had wanted to continue.|$|E

25|$|The current superdominance of Eucalyptus in Australia {{may be an}} {{artefact}} {{of human}} influence on its ecology. In more recent sediments, numerous findings of {{a dramatic increase in}} the abundance of Eucalyptus pollen are associated with increased charcoal levels.

25|$|In {{addition}} to giving support and reassurance during distress, another important function of caregiving within intimate relationships is {{the provision of}} support <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> partner's personal growth, exploration, and goal strivings. In attachment theory, this type of support is called providing a secure base and is postulated to encourage the relationship partner's confident, autonomous exploration of the environment outside of the attachment relationship. This phenomenon was originally observed in young children; children whose parents showed more intrusiveness {{were less likely to}} engage in play and exploration in a novel environment.|$|E
25|$|As late as 1799, priests {{were still}} being imprisoned or {{deported}} to penal colonies. Persecution only worsened after the French army led by General Louis Alexandre Berthier captured Rome in early 1798, declared a new Roman Republic, and imprisoned Pope Pius VI, who would die in captivity in Valence, France in August 1799. Ultimately, with Napoleon now in ascendancy in France, year-long negotiations between government officials and the new Pope Pius VII led to the Concordat of 1801, formally ending the dechristianization period and establishing the rules <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> between the Roman Church and the French State.|$|E

In determining the penalty, the court took into account the finding that De G. was legally insane {{at the time of the}} crime. De G. was acquitted of manslaughter on the basis of the possibility that another of the three people whose DNA was found, who was never affirmatively identified, was involved in the death.|$|E
25|$|A {{large portion}} of Wordsworth's {{education}} at Hawkshead was based on mathematics. The rest of the curriculum was based on teaching the classics, and it was during his classical studies that Wordsworth gained a love for Latin literature. Besides his literary education, Wordsworth and his brothers were given dancing lessons in 1785. While Wordsworth was taught at Hawkshead, he boarded with Hugh and Ann Tyson in the nearby hamlet of Colthouse, where he was exposed to the local yarn trade. The community had a strong Quaker influence, and Wordsworth, after experiencing their traditions, rejected their fixation on praising God <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> with the divine that would involve a more direct interaction.|$|E
25|$|Whether or not {{non-ionizing}} radiation causes leukemia {{has been studied}} for several decades. The International Agency for Research on Cancer expert working group undertook a detailed review of all data on static and extremely low frequency electromagnetic energy, which occurs naturally and {{in association with the}} generation, transmission, and use of electrical power. They concluded that there is limited evidence that high levels of ELF magnetic (but not electric) fields might cause some cases of childhood leukemia. No evidence <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> to leukemia or another form of malignancy in adults has been demonstrated. Since exposure to such levels of ELFs is relatively uncommon, the World Health Organization concludes that ELF exposure, if later proven to be causative, would account for just 100 to 2400 cases worldwide each year, representing 0.2 to 4.9% of the total incidence of childhood leukemia for that year (about 0.03 to 0.9% of all leukemias).|$|E

25|$|During the Reign of Terror, extreme {{efforts of}} de-Christianisation ensued, {{including}} the imprisonment and massacre of priests {{and destruction of}} churches and religious images throughout France. An {{effort was made to}} replace the Catholic Church altogether, with civic festivals replacing religious ones. The establishment of the Cult of Reason was the final step of radical de-Christianisation. These events led to a widespread disillusionment with the Revolution and to counter-rebellions across France. Locals often resisted de-Christianisation by attacking revolutionary agents and hiding members of the clergy who were being hunted. Eventually, Robespierre and the Committee of Public Safety were forced to denounce the campaign, replacing the Cult of Reason with the deist but still non-Christian Cult of the Supreme Being. The Concordat of 1801 between Napoleon and the Church ended the de-Christianisation period and established the rules <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> between the Catholic Church and the French State that lasted until it was abrogated by the Third Republic via {{the separation of church and}} state on 11 December 1905. The persecution of the Church led to a counter-revolution known as the Revolt in the Vendée.|$|E
25|$|As {{passed by}} Congress, FATCA {{was meant to}} form the basis <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> between the U.S. Department of the Treasury and {{individual}} FFI's. Personnel at some FFIs responded by asserting, however, {{that it was not}} possible for the FFIs to follow their own countries' laws (privacy, confidentiality, discrimination, etc.) and simultaneously to comply with FATCA as is. Discussions from financial industry lobbyists resulted in the creation of Intergovernmental Agreements (IGA's) between the Executive Branch of the United States government with foreign governments. This development resulted in foreign governments to implement the US FATCA requirements into their own legal systems, which in turn allowed those governments to change their privacy and discrimination laws to allow the identification and reporting of US persons via those governments. In an IGA, a government agrees that all of its financial institutions shall comply with FATCA (whereas without the IGA each FFI {{would have been able to}} decide if it were to comply with FATCA or not). With the IGA's, the private data of suspected US persons would be collected and handled by the FFI's, whereas the many governments would then collect and store that data for further transmittal. The IGA added the applicable government to the list of handlers of the data.|$|E
25|$|Many {{studies have}} {{reported}} significant psychosocial risk factors for bruxism, particularly a stressful lifestyle, and this evidence is growing, but still not conclusive. Some consider emotional stress {{to be the main}} triggering factor. It has been reported that persons with bruxism respond differently to depression, hostility and stress compared to people without bruxism. Stress has a stronger relationship to awake bruxism, but the role of stress in sleep bruxism is less clear, with some stating that there is no evidence <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> with sleep bruxism. However, children with sleep bruxism have been shown to have greater levels of anxiety than other children. People aged 50 with bruxism {{are more likely to be}} single and have a high level of education. Work-related stress and irregular work shifts may also be involved. Personality traits are also commonly discussed in publications concerning the causes of bruxism, e.g. aggressive, competitive or hyperactive personality types. Some suggest that suppressed anger or frustration can contribute to bruxism. Stressful periods such as examinations, family bereavement, marriage, divorce, or relocation have been suggested to intensify bruxism. Awake bruxism often occurs during periods of concentration such as while working at a computer, driving or reading. Animal studies have also suggested a link between bruxism and psychosocial factors. Rosales et al. electrocuted lab rats, and then observed high levels of bruxism-like muscular activity in rats that were allowed to watch this treatment compared to rats that did not see it. They proposed that the rats who witnessed the electrocution of other rats were under emotional stress which may have caused the bruxism-like behavior.|$|E
