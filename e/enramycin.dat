50|$|<b>Enramycin</b> or Enduracidin is a {{polypeptide}} antibiotic {{produced by}} Streptomyces fungicidus. <b>Enramycin</b> {{is widely used}} as a feed additive for pigs and chickens to prevent necrotic enteritis induced by Gram-positive gut pathogens.|$|E
50|$|<b>Enramycin</b> {{has been}} found to be very {{effective}} against Gram-positive gut pathogens, most notably, Clostridium perfringens; a leading cause of necrotic enteritis. The following represents MIC data for a couple of veterinary pathogens.|$|E
50|$|<b>Enramycin</b> {{acts as an}} {{inhibitor}} of the enzyme, MurG, {{which is}} essential for cell wall biosynthesis in Gram-positive bacteria. MurG catalyzes the transglycosylation reaction in the last step of peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Inhibiting this step greatly compromises cell wall integrity leading to cell lysis.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effects of Bacillus subtilis UBT-MO 2 on growth performance, relative immune organ weight, gas concentration in excreta, and intestinal microbial shedding in broiler chickens. A total of 480 1 -d-old mixed sex broilers were randomly allotted to a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments with 2 levels of <b>enramycin</b> (0 or 5 ppm) and B. subtilis (0 or 105 cfu/kg) for 35 d. Each treatment had 6 replicate pens with 20 broilers in each pen. Diets were fed in 2 phases: starter phase (from d 0 to 21) and grower phase (from d 22 to 35). Overall, broilers fed diets supplemented with B. subtilis had 4. 4 % greater (P= 0. 01) body weight gain than those fed non-probiotic diets. The feed conversion ratio in broilers fed diets containing <b>enramycin</b> was decreased by 2. 8 % and 4. 2 % during d 0 – 21 (P= 0. 05) and throughout the experimental period (P= 0. 02), respectively, than those fed diets without antibiotic. Broilers fed B. subtilis diets had 30. 9 % greater (P= 0. 02) relative weight of thymus than those fed diets without probiotic. Dietary supplementation with B. subtilis resulted in 26. 9 % and 37. 9 % lower (P= 0. 03) NH 3 and H 2 S concentrations, respectively, in excreta compared with no supplementation. However, no differences were observed in intestinal bacterial concentrations among treatments. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with 105 cfu/kg of B. subtilis could improve the growth performance of broiler chickens, and reduced NH 3 and H 2 S emissions...|$|E
40|$|Antimicrobials are {{sometimes}} given to food animals at low doses {{in order to}} promote faster growth. However, the mechanisms by which those drugs improve performance are not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the impact of zinc bacitracin (55 g/ton), <b>enramycin</b> (10 g/ton); halquinol® (30 g/ton); virginiamycin (16, 5 g/ton) and avilamycin (10 g/ton) on the cecal microbiota of broiler chicken, compared to a control group. Six hundred and twenty four chicks (Cobb 500) arriving to an experimental unit were randomly assigned into each treatment with four repetitions per treatment. The cecal content of 16 animals per treatment (n = 96) was used for DNA extraction and sequencing of the V 4 region of the 16 S rRNA gene using Illumina technology. The use of antimicrobials induced significant changes in membership but not in structure of the cecal microbiota compared to the control group, suggesting a greater impact on the less abundant species of bacteria present in that environment. Halquinol was the only drug that did not affect microbial membership. Firmicutes comprised the major bacterial phylum present in the cecum of all groups. There was no statistical difference in relative abundances of the main phyla between treated animals and the control group (all P> 0. 05). Treatment with <b>enramycin</b> was associated with decreased richness and with lower relative abundance of unclassified Firmicutes, Clostridium XI, unclassified Peptostreptococcaceae (all P< 0. 001) and greater abundance of Clostridium XIVb (P = 0. 004) and Anaerosporobacter spp. (P = 0. 015), and treatment with bacitracin with greater relative abundance of Bilophila spp. (P = 0. 004). Several bacterial genera were identified as representative of usage of each drug. This study used high throughput sequencing to characterize the impact of several antimicrobials in broiler chicken under controlled conditions and add new insights to the current knowledge on how AGPs affect the cecal microbiota of chicken...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{investigated}} the effects of Cymbopogon flexuosus and Lippia rotundifolia microencapsulated essential oils on broiler performance and carcass yield. One hundred and fifty mixed-sex Cobb broiler chicks were used, from one day up to 42 days of age, in a completely randomized design, with five treatments and three replicates of ten birds each. The treatments were: negative control (basal diet), positive control (diet with <b>enramycin</b> and salinomycin), and three diets with microencapsulated essential oils from lemongrass, L. rotundifolia, and combination with 50 % of both. The performance and carcass yield were not affected by the treatments. The intestine absolute weight was lower in the combination treatment compared with the negative control treatment and the lemongrass essential oil. The intestine relative weight was higher in the treatments with lemongrass and L. rotundifolia essential oils {{in relation to the}} combination. The liver relative weight was lower with the lemongrass essential oil and the combination compared with the treatment with the L. rotundifolia essential oil. The trial could not find results enough to recommend the use of the lemongrass and L. rotundifolia essential oils as an additive in broiler diets...|$|E
40|$|A 30 -day broiler cage {{trial was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of dietary mannan oligosaccharide (MOS) from one commercial product (SAF-Mannan) on growth parameters, gut health and control pathogen colonization of broilers under C lostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) challenge. One hundred, 0 -day old male Ross 308 broilers were allocated in 4 experimental treatments for 30 days. The four dietary treatments were T 1, standard broiler basal diets without any medication as a control (+CONT); T 2, basal diets as in T 1 plus C. perfringens challenge (-CONT); T 3, <b>enramycin</b> 0. 1 g/kg of feed plus C. perfringens challenge (ENRA); T 4, SAF-Mannan at 0. 5 g/kg in starter and finisher diets plus C. perfringens challenge (SAF).

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the influence of a commercial essential oil blend (EO), CRINA® Poultry (CRP), as an alternative to in-feed antibiotic, enramycine®, on growth parameters of broilers during pre - and post -challenge with Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens). The birds received treatments from 0 to 30 days as follows: T 1, positive control (+CONT) : without medication or bacterial challenge; T 2, negative control (-CONT) : without medication but with C. perfringens challenge; T 3, antibiotic with addition of <b>enramycin</b> with C. perfringens challenge (ENRA); and T 4, with addition of CRINA® Poultry to feed with C. perfringens challenge (CRP). Overall, feed intake (FI), body weight gain (BWG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) was not significantly different among the four treatments (P> 0. 05). On the other hand, EO supplementation caused some changes in the gut morphology, birds which had received CRP had longer ileal villi as compared to +CONT orENRA groups (P< 0. 05). The performance of the birds which had consumed CRP was similar to all other treatments. On the other hand, the results obtained from this trail clearly showed that CRP supplementation failed to control the proliferation of C. perfringens in the intestine. The results from this study indicated that CRP under the condition of this experiment had no influence on broilers performance but it had a positive effect on gut morphology...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of microbial or antimicrobial additives on the performance and organ morphology of broilers raised in batteries or in floor pens. The effect of microbial additives on the presence of oocysts in the litter was also studied. Experiments 1 and 2 consisted of four treatments (non-supplemented control diet or diet supplemented with avilamycin, bacitracin methylene disalicylate or <b>enramycin)</b> and six repetitions in a randomized block design. In Experiment 1, 288 day-old chicks were housed in heated batteries in a environmentally controlled room, 12 chicks per cage; in Experiment 2, 1, 200 day-old chicks were housed in a curtain-sided experimental house, with concrete floor and rice hulls as litter material, 50 chicks per pen. Experiments 3 and 4 were carried out similarly to Experiments 1 and 2, respectively, but the treatments consisted of microbial additives (non-supplemented control diet or Bacillus subtilis added to the feed plus Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus johnsonii added to the water, undefined microflora added to the water or live yeast added to the feed). The antibiotics did not affect the performance of birds raised in batteries, but improved feed conversion, weight gain and live weight when chickens were kept on the floor pens. Microbial additives did not affect bird performance in any environment; however, treatments affected liver weight. Microbial agents increased intestinal weight in floor-raised broilers. No relationship was seen between the use of microbial additives and the presence of oocysts in the litter...|$|E
40|$|Antimicrobials are {{extensively}} used as {{growth promoters}} in animal feeds worldwide, but reliable estimates are lacking. We conducted an internet-based survey of commercial chicken and pig feed products officially approved {{for sale in}} Vietnam over the period March-June 2015. Information on the antimicrobial contents in feed products, alongside animal production data, was used to estimate in-feed antimicrobial consumption to produce one kilogram of live animal (chicken, pig), {{as well as to}} estimate country-wide antimicrobial consumption through animal feeds. A total of 1462 commercial feed formulations were examined. The survey-adjusted estimated antimicrobial contents were 25. 7 and 62. 3  mg/kg in chicken and pig feeds, respectively. Overall, it was estimated that 77. 4  mg [95 % CI 48. 1 - 106. 8] and 286. 6  mg [95 % CI 191. 6 - 418. 3] of in-feed antimicrobials were used to raise 1  kg of live chicken and pig, respectively. Bacitracin (15. 5 % feeds), chlortetracycline (11. 4 %), and <b>enramycin</b> (10. 8 %) were the most common antimicrobials present in chicken feed formulations, whereas bacitracin (24. 8 %), chlortetracycline (23. 9 %), and florfenicol (17. 4 %) were the most common in pig feed formulations. Overall, 57 % of the total quantitative usage consisted of antimicrobials regarded by WHO of importance for human medicine, including amoxicillin, colistin, tetracyclines, neomycin, lincomycin, and bacitracin. These figures confirm a very high magnitude of in-feed consumption of antimicrobials, especially in pig production. Results from this study should encourage further monitoring of antimicrobials used in animal production, and foster discussion about existing policies on inclusion of antimicrobials in animal feed rations...|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred and}} twenty {{weanling}} pigs in experiment 1 (Exp. 1) (6. 91 ± 0. 99 kg; 21 d of age) and Exp. 2 (10. 20 ± 1. 09 kg; 28 d of age) were used in two 42 -d and 35 -d experiments to evaluate the effect of medium-chain-triglyceride (MCT) on growth performance, apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients and blood profile. In both of Exp. 1 and Exp. 2, the same dietary treatments were utilized as follows : i) negative control (NC), ii) positive control (PC), NC+antibiotics (40 mg/kg Tiamulin, 110 mg/kg Tylosin, and 10 mg/kg <b>Enramycin,</b> iii) MCT 3, NC+ 0. 32 % (phase 1, 2 and 3) MCT, and iv) MCT 5, NC+ 0. 55 % (phase 1), 0. 32 % (phase 2 and 3) MCT. In Exp. 1, the pigs fed MCT 5 diets had higher (p< 0. 05) ADG compared to NC treatment during the first 2 wk. From d 15 to 28, the ATTD of energy was improved (p< 0. 05) by MCT 3 compared to the PC treatment. No effect has been observed on the blood profiles [red blood cell (RBC), white blood cell (WBC), immunoglobulin-G (IgG), lymphocyte concentration] measured in this study. In Exp. 2, the ADG were increased (p< 0. 05) by the MCT 5 treatment than the PC treatment from d 0 to 14. Pigs fed PC treatment diet had lower ADFI (p< 0. 05) and better FCR (p< 0. 05) than NC treatment, whereas no differences were shown between MCT treatments and NC or PC treatment from d 15 to 35 and overall phase. The ATTD of DM and nitrogen were improved (p< 0. 05) by the effect of MCT 5 related to the NC and PC treatment {{at the end of}} 2 nd and 5 th wk. The pigs fed MCT 3 had higher (p< 0. 05) energy digestibility than PC treatment. No effects were seen in the blood profiles we measured (WBC, RBC, lymphocyte and immunoglobulin-G). In conclusion, the addition of MCT in the weanling pigs diet can improve the ADG and digestibility during the earlier period (first 2 wks), but had little effect on the blood characteristics...|$|E
