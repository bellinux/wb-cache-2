40|$|Summary: Intraarterial {{fibrinolysis}} {{was performed}} in three patients with acute central retinal artery occlusion using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator as a fibrinolytic agent. In two cases the ophthalmic artery was selectively catheterized, {{and in the other}} a thrombolytic drug was in-fused into the ophthalmic artery by way of the meningeal collaterals. All patients experienced visual improvement. Fibrinolysis can produce better results than obtained from conservative treatment. A good prognosis can be achieved if the treatment starts within the first 4 to 5 hours after occlusion. Intraarterial fibrinolysis has primarily been used in the treatment of thromboembolic occlusion of the cerebral arteries, with good results (1 – 4). Early ap-plications in the ophthalmic territory produced a high rate of recanalization of the central retinal ar-tery, with better outcomes than achieved with con-servative treatment (5 – 7). The therapeutic goal in central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is to re-store the retinal blood flow as soon as possible. Marked improvement has been reported when fi-brinolysis was initiated within the first hours after occlusion (5 – 7). We describe three patients with CRAO treated by superselective <b>intraarterial</b> fibrinolysis <b>using</b> a short-acting fibrinolytic agent, such as recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA) ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The suture middle {{cerebral}} artery occlusion (MCAO) model {{is widely used}} for the simulation of focal cerebral ischemia in rats. This technique causes hypothalamic injury resulting in hyperthermia, which can worsen outcome and obscure neuroprotective effects. Herein, we introduce a new MCAO model that avoids these disadvantages. METHODS: Permanent MCAO was performed by <b>intraarterial</b> embolization <b>using</b> six TiO(2) macrospheres (0. 3 - 0. 4 mm in diameter) or by the suture occlusion technique. Body temperature was monitored, functional and histologic outcome was assessed after 24 h. Additional 16 rats were subjected to macrosphere or suture MCAO. Lesion progression was evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS: The animals subjected to suture MCAO developed hyperthermia (3 ̆e 39 degrees C), while the temperature remained normal in the macrosphere MCAO group. Infarct size, functional outcome and model failure rate {{were not significantly different}} between the groups. Lesion size on MRI increased within the first 90 min and remained unchanged thereafter in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The macrosphere MCAO model provides reproducible focal cerebral ischemia, similar to the established suture technique, but avoids hypothalamic damage and hyperthermia. This model, therefore, may be more appropriate for the preclinical evaluation of neuroprotective therapies and can also be used for stroke studies under difficult conditions, e. g., in awake animals or inside the MRI scanner...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPurpose: This {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine spinal cord blood flow using the H 2 clearance method. Methods: In 12 dogs we measured blood flow determined by hydrogen clearance techniques (BF) in both gray and white matter by spinal cord puncture, and compared the results with BF measured by a catheter inserted intrathecally to avoid spinal cord injury. We studied direct intraarterial and intravenous injection of hydrogen {{in addition to the}} inhalation method because hydrogen is an explosive gas. Results: BF measured intrathecally with catheters adherent to either the ventral or the dorsal funiculus did not differ significantly from that of the gray matter. BF measured with a catheter inserted into the epidural space was about one fourth of the BF measured intrathecally. Values measured by the intraarterial injection method did not differ significantly from those obtained by the inhalation method.

40|$|We {{encountered}} {{a case of}} stroke caused by a basilar artery embolism due to stenosis at {{the origin of the}} right vertebral artery. The patient was successfully treated with a combination of intraarterial fibrinolytic therapy and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). A 57 -year-old man complained of transient ischemic symptoms such as vertigo, tinnitus and vomiting. CT scan and MRI revealed multiple infarctions in the cerebellar hemispheres. Subclavian angiography demonstrated focal stenosis at the origin of the right vertebral artery and complete occlusion of the left vertebral artery. The next day, the patient suddenly became comatose. Emergent angiography performed within an hour confirmed occlusion of the basilar artery. Recanalization of the basilar artery was obtained with <b>intraarterial</b> fibrinolytic therapy <b>using</b> 6. 4 million units of tissue plasminogen activator. Subsequently, PTA was performed for the focal stenosis of the right vertebral artery. Dilatation with a 3. 0 mm balloon angioplasty catheter resulted in improvement of the luminal diameter in the stenotic region. The patient demonstrated a dramatic recovery from the coma during the procedure and was discharged without neurological deficits.

40|$|The authors {{discuss the}} {{advantages}} and disadvantages of the use of magnetic resonance (MR) angiography images in stereotactic neurosurgery. Current computer programs designed to assist the neurosurgeon in the planning of stereotactic neurosurgical interventions <b>use</b> <b>intraarterial</b> digital subtraction angiography images to visualize the blood vessels. Magnetic resonance angiography is a recent technique with a number of advantages over the digital subtraction method: it is less invasive and less prone to complications; it provides truly three-dimensional data sets that can be viewed from any direction; and it can visualize both stationary and flowing tissues with the same imaging device and localizer frame. Although digital subtraction images are still superior in contrast and vascular detail, state-of-the-art high-resolution MR angiography sequences provide sufficient vascular detail for planning surgery. Contrast-enhanced MR angiography images were acquired using adapted gradient-echo sequences to compensate for flow-induced distortions; postacquisition distortion correction was not necessary. Five methods to integrate and inspect a possible trajectory in the MR angiography data are discussed. Initial clinical experience with eight patients led to the conclusion that MR angiography is a valuable imaging modality that can be integrated reliably into a stereotactic neurosurgery planning procedure. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Die vorliegende Studie befasst sich mit der palliativen Chemotherapie von inoperablen hepatischen Metastasen des Pankreaskarzinoms sowie inoperablen Intrahepatischen Cholangiozellulären Karzinomen. Sie beschäftigt sich mit dem intraarteriellen Therapieansatz. Untersucht und verglichen wurden hier zwei verschiedene Applikationsarten (intraarteriell appliziertes Gemcitabine als Chemoperfusion gegenüber intraarteriell appliziertem Gemcitabine in Kombination mit Stärkemikrosphären als Chemoembolisation) im Bezug auf Erfassung der maximal tolerablen Dosis sowie die Evaluation der Ansprechraten, der Überlebenszeit und des Klinischen Benefits. Im Rahmen der Studie konnte gezeigt werden, dass höhere Dosen als die empfohlenen 1000 mg/m 2 KO Gemcitabine bei guter Verträglichkeit möglich sind, und die Kombination der intraarteriellen Chemotherapieapplikation mit Gemcitabine und zusätzlicher Gabe von Embolisationspartikeln eine signifikant effektive Therapieerweiterung bezüglich einer Lebensverlängerung, nicht aber bezüglich der Ansprechraten, darstellt. Aktuell gilt dieses Verfahren nicht als Standard, sondern wird meist nur bei Versagen einer systemischen Chemotherapie angewendet. Sinnvoll erscheint die Entscheidung zu einer intraarteriellen Therapie jedoch nur, wenn eine isolierte hepatische Metastasierung bzw. ein primärer Lebertumor ohne Fernmetastasen vorliegt mit dem Ziel einer regionalen Tumorkontrolle und im Idealfall einer Tumorverkleinerung.

This study indicates that higher doses than the recommended 1000 mg/m 2 of Gemcitabine are well tolerated and that the <b>intraarterial</b> chemotherapy <b>using</b> a combination with embolisation particles as a chemoembolisation regimen yields significantly better results in survival rates but not in tumor response rates.

Arterial capacitive compliance was significantly lower in isolated systolic hypertension than in essential hypertension (P. 0002) and signifi-cantly lower in essential hypertension than in normotensive control subjects (P. 0001). Although the isolated systolic hypertension group was older than the essential hypertension group, the reduction of capacitive compliance in isolated systolic hypertension persisted even when comparison was made with a more nearly age-matched group of essential hypertension. In contrast, oscillatory compliance was reduced similarly in isolated systolic hypertension and essential hy-pertension compared to normotensive control subjects (P. 0001). Although pulse pressure was greater in isolated sys-tolic hypertension than in essential hypertension, only a weak correlation (r 0. 34) existed between pulse pressure and capacitive compliance. These data indicate that both essential hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension patients ex-hibit comparably abnormal structure or tone of the small vessels that are the site of oscillations or reflections in the arterial vasculature. In isolated systolic hypertension there is a profound reduction in large artery or capacitive compliance that accounts for the increase in systolic BP and decrease in diastolic BP. This abnormality cannot be accurately assessed by pulse pressure alone. Am J Hypertens 2001; 14...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} {{peripheral}} effect of somatostatin in dogs a tiny Silastic catheter was implanted {{in an almost}} terminal branch of the mesenteric artery, providing blood supply to a jejunal segment of 5 - 10 cm. In 4 dogs one catheter was implanted, perfusing a small bowel segment about 60 cm below the angle of Treitz; in 3 dogs two catheters were implanted, perfusing two small bowel segments about 30 and 60 cm below the angle of Treitz. The catheter was kept open by continuous perfusion with a diluted heparin solution {{by means of a}} portable insulin infusion pump fixed to the animal's protection jacket. Small bowel motility was recorded electromyographically. Experiments were started 2 wk after surgery and were performed in conscious fasted animals. Control experiments <b>using</b> <b>intraarterial</b> saline perfusion showed normal migrating motor complexes in the perfused segment. Intraarterial perfusion of somatostatin (50 - 200 ng/kg X h) induced ectopic activity fronts, which always started just distal to the perfused segment and progressed down the small bowel at a normal propagation velocity. During the occurrence of ectopic fronts no activity fronts were observed in the small bowel proximal to the perfusion site. Apart from ectopic fronts, normal activity fronts, starting in the duodenum and passing the perfused segment, were also observed. The most proximal part of the jejunum was more sensitive to intraarterial somatostatin than the more distal jejunum. Intravenous infusion of the same doses of somatostatin had no effect. Somatostatin, therefore, seems to induce ectopic fronts via a local mechanism. We propose that somatostatin is able to relieve the intestine locally from an inhibitory mechanism that prevents the development of activity fronts. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background: Erucylphosphocholine (ErPC) {{has been}} shown to exert strong antineoplastic effects against various brain tumor cell lines in vitro. Since ErPC only enters the brain after long- term treatment, {{ineffective}} drug delivery to the tumor is considered to be the reason for the moderate responses to chemotherapy with ErPC observed in animal brain tumor models. We investigated a recently described method for chemically opening the blood-brain barrier (BBB) <b>using</b> <b>intraarterial</b> administration of alkylglycerols to increase the transfer of ErPC into the brain. Methods: ErPC (40 mg/kg) was given to C 6 glioma-bearing rats either as a single intracarotid bolus injection in {{the presence or absence of}} 1 -O-pentylglycerol (300 mM) or as an intracarotid infusion in conjunction with bradykinin. Brain tissue concentrations were analyzed and compared to values obtained after intravenous ErPC treatment over 14 and 30 days (cumulative ErPC doses of 210 and 350 mg/kg, respectively). Results: Pentylglycerol-induced BBB opening resulted in a significant increase in ErPC delivery to the tumor (17 -fold) and, to a lesser extent, to the surrounding ipsilateral brain (7 -fold) compared to intraarterial ErPC administration without alkylglycerol (P < 0. 05). Furthermore, the resulting ErPC concentrations in the brain tumor exceeded those obtained in tumor and tumor-free brain after long-term intravenous ErPC administration. In contrast to this, intracarotid bradykinin did not increase the transfer of ErPC to the tumor or tumor-free brain. Conclusions: The intracarotid administration of pentylglycerol represents a novel and nontoxic method of overcoming the limited access of ErPC to both brain tumors and brain tissue adjacent to tumors. The present results provide further evidence that chemical opening of the BBB by intraarterial alkylglycerols is a promising new concept for improving delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to brain tumors...|$|R
40|$|In the neuroradiologic {{evaluation}} of 118 patients using intraar-terial {{digital subtraction angiography}} definite advantages and disadvantages were defined. Advantages include reduction of contrast medium volume, catheter time, and patient risk and discomfort. It also aids in angiographic planning. The paramount disadvantage is less spatial resolution compared with conven-tional film angiography. Digital subtraction equipment has been developed independently and essentially simultaneously at severeal centers [1 - 4]. Early neuroradiologic application of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) equipment focused on intravenous injection of radiographic contrast med ium to visu alize the extracranial carotid arteries [5 - 7]. A large number of arti c les have since explored a variety of uses of intra-venous DSA {{as it applies to}} neuroradiology as well as other areas of cardiovascular investigation. However, the use of this same equipment to augment the visual-ization of small volumes of contrast medium delivered via an intraar-terial catheter has been virtually ignored. The <b>use</b> of <b>intraarterial</b> DSA injection was first mentioned by Meaney et al. [6], who de-scribed the comparison of intraarterial DSA and conventional ab-dominal aortography and presented one intraarterial DSA of a selective internal mammary artery. Additional mention of the pos-sible advantages of intraarterial DSA was made by Mistretta et al. [8], but no images were published. Comparisons of intraarterial DSA images, intravenous DSA images, and conventional angio-grams of the carotid arteries in 50 patients were presented by Weinstein et al. [9]. Subsequently, Hawkins [10] published a single intraarterial DSA image of the abdominal aorta using iodinated contrast medium for comparison with digitally enhanced CO 2 arte-riography. Since th e installation of digital subtraction equipment in the neuroangiographic suite at Vanderbilt University Hospital we {{have had the opportunity to}} explore various neuroradiologic applications of intraarterial DSA [11, 12].

40|$|Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) is a genetic disorder characterized by mutations in the dystrophin gene {{that cause the}} absence of the dystrophin protein at the muscle fiber membrane of the affected patients. This leads to myofiber degeneration and progressive muscle wasting, ultimately resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Currently, there is no treatment that prevents or reverses the disease progression. Genetically corrected stem/progenitor cells could potentially provide an effective treatment. However, due to its large size, commonly used viral vector technologies preclude efficient gene transfer of the full-length dystrophin coding DNA sequence (CDS; size: 11. 1 Kb). In this study we validated a novel stem cell-based non-viral gene therapy approach for DMD with the use of piggyBac (PB) transposons. These plasmidbased non-viral vectors are able to stably integrate the gene of interest into the genome of the target cells leading to its sustained expression. Moreover, the large cargo capacity of these vectors could overcome one of the main bottlenecks in the field enabling gene therapy with full-length instead of truncated dystrophin. We have therefore generated PB transposons coding for either fulllength or truncated versions of the human dystrophin CDS. We demonstrated that this system enables stable non-viral gene delivery, with sustained expression of both full-length and truncated versions of dystrophin into murine myoblasts. We subsequently transferred PB transposons containing the fulllength human dystrophin CDS into dystrophic mesoangioblasts (MABs). These myogenic vessel associated stem/progenitor cells are capable of crossing the vessels and contribute to the regeneration of the dystrophic muscles upon <b>intraarterial</b> transplantation. The <b>use</b> of MABs has resulted to be relatively safe in a recently completed phase I/II clinical trial based on intra-arterial infusions at escalating doses of HLA-matched donor-derived MABs in DMD patients under immunosuppressive regimen (EudraCTno. 2011 - 000176 - 33). In our study, MABs were isolated from the muscles of a large animal model for DMD, the Golden Retriever {{muscular dystrophy}} (GRMD) dog. The genetically corrected GRMD MABs showed stable transposition and expression of the full-length human 12 dystrophin. Since MABs have a limited proliferative capacity, we have also investigated the possible use of MABs generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of patients suffering from DMD, as an alternative (designated as human iPSC-derived mesoangioblast-like cells or HIDEMs). These cells can be expanded in culture to obtain a potentially unlimited supply of myogenic progenitors. HIDEMs derived from patients affected by DMD were then genetically corrected with PB transposons resulting in stable expression of the full-length human dystrophin CDS. These cells successfully engrafted into the muscles of immunodeficient/dystrophic mice (scid/mdx) leading to the in vivo expression of the PB-mediated full-length human dystrophin in the myofiber membrane. Taken together, these results showed {{for the first time the}} validity of a non-viral gene transfer approach based on PB transposons that allows for the sustained expression of the full-length human dystrophin in dystrophic MABs and DMD patient-specific iPSC-derived MABs. This study paves the way towards a novel stem/progenitor cell-based non-viral gene therapy for the treatment of DMD exploiting the potential of PB transposons to deliver large therapeutic genes. status: publishe...|$|R
