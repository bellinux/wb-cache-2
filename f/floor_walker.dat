50|$|Throughout its {{short life}} (2002-2003) L.V.D.A. was {{credited}} with derailing efforts to institute business license fees for dancers in Clark County and efforts to prohibit the popular practice of G-string tipping. Indeed, all who travel to the Las Vegas Strip and place a buck in a stripper's garter owe a debt of gratitude to the organization. It also focused the public's attention on unscrupulous industry practices such as house fees in excess of $100, dance fees, late fees, stage fees, missed stage fees, missed shift fees, mandatory tips for disc jockeys, valet parking, house moms, and <b>floor</b> <b>walkers,</b> and indiscriminate firings. As well as the practice of mandating work cards in Las Vegas that require FBI background checks for dancers. L.V.D.A. was the only organization of adult entertainment workers in Las Vegas to take on these issues {{and one of the}} few examples of class struggle within the adult entertainment industry in America.|$|R

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of {{sustainable}} design is to utilize the natural resources offered by the surrounding environment. Considering the drought conditions {{over the past several}} years, water is a resource that received significant consideration in the planning and design phases at four elementary schools in McKinney ISD. By harvesting the rainwater from the roof of the building and channeling this water into six oncampus storage tanks, enough rainwater can be collected to flush the toilets and irrigate the school's lawn areas. The rainwater collection and utilization system includes gutters to direct the water to the cisterns, cisterns to collect the rainwater and pumps to distribute the water. A <b>floor</b> plan of <b>Walker</b> Elementary School is shown in Figure 1. Other features of the system include a piping loop for tank equalization, a circulation system for freeze protection, a booster system for flushing, a tie-in to City water for make-up water and chemical treatment. Another element of sustainable design is ?eco education? which is a concept that incorporates sustainability into the curriculum so that students can understand the design and how it impacts the environment. By making this collection system visible, it is a very powerful teaching tool for students to learn about water conservation. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present detailed information on the rainwater collection and utilization system at four elementary schools in McKinney ISD. This information will include planning issues and considerations, design features and constraints, construction needs and maintenance and operation requirements...|$|R
6000|$|For {{the great}} {{majority}} of the workers, the interest of work as such is gone. It is a task done consciously for a wage, one eye upon the clock.

[...] The varied craftsmanship of the artisan had in it something of the creative element that was the parent motive of sustained industry. The dull routine of the factory hand in a cotton mill has gone. The life of a pioneer settler in America two hundred years ago, penurious and dangerous as it was, stands out brightly beside the dull and meaningless toil of his descendant.|$|E

Sybby tells her: No, you can't be in love with two men, at the same time, one is an indigestion!While Agnes sends away Schlumpy, because she is not the right social level for him, convinced that Evangeline is the right one, she finally convinces Red to marry her and become <b>floor</b> <b>walker</b> and change his name into Schlump, he accepting and saying [...] "but my men hood is gone".
