5000|$|The U.S. diplomat James Dobbins {{writes that}} an early draft of JCS 1067 {{had been written}} while the plan was still {{understood}} to be U.S. policy, and [...] "because nothing replaced the Morgenthau plan once it had been disavowed, {{the final version of}} JCS 1067 contained many of the harsh measures and all the intent of a hard peace toward Germany". However, according to Dobbin, in May 1945 - shortly after its approval in April 1945 - the newly appointed deputy military governor, General Clay, implied that the directive was unworkable and initially wanted it to be revised; after the deliberate loopholes were pointed out to him, General Clay did not press further for a revision but [...] "took great liberties in interpreting and implementing JCS 1067". Clay's good-willed effort did meet obstacles, like General Marshall forbidding him from relax the strict non-fraternization to a more reasonable level. Dobbins remarks that the harsh punitive measures shifted toward reform over time as the US faced with the problem of feeding millions of Germans and the Soviet expansion. [...] mentions that the American military government was, until 1947, operating under JCS 1067, which he describes as [...] "a framework that had its origin in the Morgenthau Plan". also mentions that [...] "As far as I know the results the revisionist debate, it seems to me that, although plans for a policy concerning post-war Germany had been developed as early as 1941, no plan had been adopted by the president that could have served as a basis for a purposeful policy. This resulted in the German question being postponed to after the final victory over the Axis Powers and Japan. At most, the short-lived approval of the Morgenthau Plan by Roosevelt might possibly be seen as a guiding principle of his policy toward Germany, especially since important elements of this plan found their way into 1067." [...] talks of the policy of [...] "Never again a strong Germany!" [...] that found its expression in the famous JCS 1067 (which was influenced by the Morgenthau Plan), but this principle was abandoned by the USA soon after the Potsdam Conference, though it was not until 1947 that JSC 1067 was replaced by JSC 1779 and its related [...] "European Recovery Program". [...] Kindleberger states that [...] "With the termination of hostilities, the mood of suppression gave way to ambivalence - in the West. Germany needed to be punished for wrongdoing, but it was also essential to revive the German economy for its necessary contribution to European recovery. The stern pronouncement of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Directive (JCS 1067) that the United States commander should do nothing to restore the German economy above the minimum level necessary to prevent such disease and unrest as might endanger the occupation forces gave way in July 1945 to an order to stimulate coal production for <b>export</b> <b>delivery</b> to Belgium, the Netherlands, and France" [...] (which did not materialize). In May 1946, General Clay's stop-order on the dismantling of plants (for reparations) marked the first open recognition of the failure of Potsdam. After 1947, when conflicting policies began to be reconciled, economic and social conditions began to be improved.Henry Burke Wend refers to JCS 1067, as approved on 14 May 1945, as a compromise document which, [...] "together with Truman's ascension to the presidency 12 April 1945, spelled the demise of the Morgenthau Plan". Despite this, [...] "denazification, deconcentration and dismantling had a profound, if varied, impact on German industrial recovery." [...] Even with the introduction of the Marshall Plan, self-defeating policies that simultaneously industrialised Germany (by investing billions of dollars) and deindustrialised it (through heavy dismantling of its industry) continued until 1948-1949.Walter M. Hudson describes JSC 1067 as less harsh than Morgenthau's plan: while core elements of the Morgenthau Plan were incorporated in JCS 1067, it was deliberately diluted, and permitted the military government to be more flexible than envisaged by the Morgenthau Plan.|$|E

40|$|Transaction {{costs and}} other market {{failures}} are widely {{present in the}} agricultural sector of emerging economies and negatively affect to low-income smallholders, making difficult their integration into dynamic agri-food supply chains. Earlier literature mentions contract farming as an economic institution {{with the potential to}} incorporate smallholders into more advanced markets and strength supply chain integration. However, the application of contract farming in some countries of Latin America has shown diverging experiences and the mere presence of contracts does not assure the sustainability of trade relationships. This research seeks to analyze the effectiveness of contract farming as a market institution between smallholders and agro-processing firms in Costa Rica. The research aims to identify and analyze the following key issues: (1) structural characteristics of the two typical agri-food supply chains for non-traditional products, namely pepper (Piper nigrum L.) and chayote (Sechium edule Sw.); (2) patterns of behavior adopted by the agents for adapting or adjusting to the market where they operate under given contractual arrangements; (3) effectiveness and rationale of the current contractual arrangement; and (4) opportunities and constraints for improving the contractual arrangement between the firm and the farmers. To address these issues, we rely on an analytical framework based on the Structure-Conduct-Performance approach, and a modeling assessment of organizational strategies under monopsonic market conditions. These frameworks enables us to analyze and explain the different strategic interactions between two parties (firm and farm), given the set of expected asymmetries of information and transaction costs that they are facing. In Chapter 2 we first analyze the causes of market failures in developing countries and the emergence of alternative institutions as response to such market failures. Contract farming is a form of governance that emerges in response to market failures for credit, insurance, information, factors of production, outlet produce; and transaction costs associated with the search of prices and markets, transfer of technology, and distribution of bargaining power, monitoring and enforcement in a transaction with a second party (Grosh, 1994; Key and Runsten, 1999). For the next actor in the chain, namely the buyer firm, contracts assures him a continuous flow of product, at the right moment, with the desired characteristics, and without operating the whole production operation. Therefore, `contracts take an intermediate position between spot markets and full vertical integration, and correspond to certain level of supply chain management, as a suitable mechanism for distributing risk between the contracting parties. The literature points out three main non-exclusive categories for contracts, namely market specification, production management and resource-providing contracts. Resource-providing contracts are particularly important for enforcing sustainability criteria or for promoting quality upgrading. The selection of a specific type of contract depends on the type of commodity, the characteristics of the contracting parties, and the prevailing market conditions at a certain period of time. Moreover, uncertainty, bargaining power, asset specificity and enforcement are key issues for the selection of supply chain governance regimes. The opportunities for reaching and maintaining a win-win situation through an agreement depends on the level of mutual trust, the exchange of information between agents, the relative distribution of bargaining power, and the enforcement costs of the contractual terms. Successful integration of small and medium size farmers into export markets seems to depend particularly on the type of contract they maintain with the firm. This contract determines their income levels, degree of autonomy and the level of risk they accept or share with the firm, and influences their willingness to invest in quality improvements or resource conservation measures. Dynamic chain advantages can only be maintained when contracts enable farmers to adapt to these changing market demands. Besides, non-price factors implicit in the contract may positively affect farmers, by improving the efficiency in their production systems and contractual relationship. In Chapter 3 we analyze the rationale and effectiveness of different types of contractual regimes, under two market configurations, between small-scale producers of pepper and agro-processing firms in the Northern region of Costa Rica. Particular attention is given to the incentives derived from contracts for the adjustment of production systems and livelihood strategies. Pepper is an attractive diversification activity for smallholders because it is a labor-intensive crop, does not require complex technologies or machinery, requires detailed attention and frequent disease control through the cropping cycle, and can reach high, fairly stable yields per hectare. This gives family farms a competitive advantage compared to large commercial plantations. A major drawback for small farmers are the high entry costs during the start-up phase, necessary for initial investments in crop establishment and the long maturation time before the first harvest. Contracts may be helpful as a strategy for overcoming these constraints and permit market access at reduced levels of uncertainty (Dorward, 2001). In the Costa Rican pepper sector we can distinguish two different market situations (competitive market and local monopsony) and three types of contractual arrangements (written contracts, verbal commitments and none agreement). The data analysis has been conducted making use of the Structure-Conduct-Performance framework (Bain, 1968; Martin, 1993) for the operations on the pepper market, followed by a statistical analysis of household and production characteristics to identify the determinants and effects of contract choice, and to estimate the importance of contracts for resource use efficiency. W e conducted a survey amongst pepper producers using a semi-structured questionnaire to obtain data on production systems and marketing arrangements. We successfully collected data from 50 producers, which represented 65 % of all pepper producers related to three processing companies. he analysis of market channel choice indicates that income-constrained farmers require contracts especially in the early phase of the establishment process of perennial crops as a guarantee for their investment efforts. In subsequent phases and under more competitive market conditions, producers prefer verbal commitments to written contracts. Furthermore, in the absence of penalties, pepper farmers with delivery commitments may become disloyal to their buyer in markets with increased competition. Most farmers keep selling the major share of the harvest to their fixed buyer but deliver small volumes to competitors as well. Consequently, contracts fulfill rather different roles during the farm household life cycle and are shaped differently under various market conditions. The analysis has also revealed that the sources of income have a clear effect on farmer's contract choice and bargaining power. Income diversification enables farmers to increase their asset specificity in pepper crops, even without the insurance provided by contracts. Besides, farmers with contracts are definitely investing more inputs and time in soil maintenance activities on their pepper plots. Resource-providing contracts in the competitive market have a stronger effect than simple market specification contracts in the monopsonistic segment. This confirms the literature regarding the importance of resource-providing contracts and vertical integration for sustainable agricultural intensification (Kuyvenhoven and Ruben, 2002). Budget-constrained farmers that intend to tailor their investment decisions in line with the designed technological package may substitute for their default in fertilizer use with additional labor investments in soil maintenance activities. Farmers without agreements can still be efficient pepper producers, but maintain substantially lower investments for resource management. The effect of contracts under different market situations indicates that local monopsonies might generate rather perverse incentives for making fixed investments in pepper plantations compared to situations where competition between buyers exists. We have recorded yields per hectare that are substantially lower in the monopsony region, even when farmers use more inputs. Local monopsonies could favor a transition towards more capital-intensive production systems, especially when relying on resource-providing contractual regimes that (temporarily) reduce input costs. This points to close complementarities between the decisions on technology choice and the type of market organization. Finally, farmers with contracts are usually better informed and more committed to the agreement with the buyer. However, the loyalty of these farmers is likely to be more related to their lack of bargaining power rather than to the availability of market information. In Chapter 4 we determined the critical factors that make chayote producers eligible for <b>export</b> <b>delivery</b> to traders-processors and we analyze the impact of contracts on quality performance and loyalty relations within the chayote supply chain. Indigenous vegetables, like chayote, represent an increasing share of non-traditional exports from Costa Rica. Farmers' possibilities to become engaged in global agro-food chains depend on the relationships established with packers and (inter) national brokers. Farmers who are able to deliver better quality and stable amounts tend to become preferred suppliers. Harvesting the crop at an immature stage and quick delivery to exporters improve post-harvest shelf-life and quality, since storage affects the firmness, appearance, flavor and nutritional value (Marín-Thiele, 1997). Contractual agreements may be helpful to reduce farmers' uncertainty and are intended to increase their loyalty towards the processor-exporter. While prices paid to the farmers are only slightly higher than those of the national market, other purchase conditions - like the terms of payment, the provision of credit for inputs and the frequency of collection - are equally or more important for the decisions regarding outlet choice (Hart and Holstrom, 1987). Furthermore, additional services (i. e. seed, credit and technical assistance) enable farmers to improve their product quality at relatively low costs, whereas can be helpful to control farmers' opportunistic behavior (Chiarelli et al., 2002). Farmers who deliver chayote to exporters make higher amounts for inputs and labor use, but face delays before receiving their final payment. Therefore, specialization in chayote production is only a feasible option when delivery contracts provide sufficient certainty. We use an analytical framework based on the Structure-Conduct-Performance approach (SCP) (Bain, 1968; Martin, 1993). Robust parameter estimates from binary regressions are presented to examine the determinants of farmers' engagement in export production. Tobit and Logit models are used to examine the probability of contractual engagements between producers and exporters, and to analyze the key factors influencing quality performance and loyalty. Field data were collected from chayote producers located in approximately fifteen villages in the valley of Ujarrás in central Costa Rica. 120 farmers were selected using a stratified sampling technique of a total population of 450 chayote producers, separated in two categories: traditional chayote producers and IDA settlers. Contracts provide an important device for improving security and enhancing the involvement of smallholders in international marketing chains. Farmers delivering under (in) formal contracts with processors/exporters have better access to credit, critical inputs and information, enabling them to benefit from economies of scale and scope. Producers' preferences for a certain processor-exporter are determined by the price paid for their product, but non-price factors (such as access to credit, technical assistance and market information) appear to be equally or more important. Moreover, prices appear to be positively related to export contracts, and these contracts in turn provide incentives for the intensification of chayote production systems. The existence of a contract improves the certainty for the producer, enabling investments in land improvements and better crop management. No direct relation was found, however, between contractual delivery {{and the quality of the}} produce, but a strong impact on loyalty was confirmed. Therefore, contracts influence farmers' production systems and household revenues in two different ways. In the first place, quality is improved as a result of better land use and more labor available for crop management and handling. This is mainly guaranteed through the selection of recently settled farmers with larger families as contractual partners. In the second place, loyalty is increased especially when these farmers can be ensured high delivery frequency. The latter is particularly important to maintain post-harvest quality and reduce rejection rates. Loyalty with processors/exporters requires contractual arrangements including provisions for technical assistance and market information as well as adequate facilities for timely product delivery and payment regimes. In Chapter 5 we analyze the dynamics of contracts in the pepper supply chain of Costa Rica. There are no spot markets for pepper and since 2001 only one processor buys fresh pepper from producers under defined quality conditions. Yet, rejection rates are in average of 10 percent of each delivery. This is a very sensitive issue for low-income farmers and one of the most common sources of distrust with the processor that tend to discourage the continuation of the relationships. Product rejection is mainly caused by two factors: (1) deficient transport conditions and (2) immature pepper included in the deliveries. Since most farmers act individually at the moment of the delivery, these two factors cause rejection rates that are partially out of their control. We explore possible forms of collective action amongst farmers with the aim of increasing the quality of pepper by improving transport conditions and organizing monitoring at the point of collection. This could reduce rejection rates and increase the farmers' bargaining power. Yet, the costs of organizing collective action should be less than the potential income increase that results from a reduction of refused pepper and/or the received price premium. We conduct the analysis for 19 farm-households from El Roble settlement; since this was the only group that started a peasant organization when market conditions changed from a competitive situation in the year 2000 to a monopsonistic market in the year 2001. We design a non-linear integer simulation model inspired by the modeling approach proposed by Dorward, (2001), which can maximize the processor's and farmers' gross income (value of sales less value of variable and fixed costs, not including labor, capital and land costs). We compare different delivery scenarios searching for hybrid organizational forms, and assess the associated trade-off between governance costs and benefits that could optimize farmers' income and processors' profit. Our model scenarios simulate the effects of collective action under initial monopsonic market conditions [1]. The model results indicate that low procurement prices of fresh pepper can make the farmers breach the group contract, even between different seasons in the year. It is furthermore shown that group contracts are only rational when higher prices prevail. To justify the group contracts, the costs of organizing collection and transport and the membership fee should be lower than the gains reached from the lower rejection rates. If the price is too low, or the organization costs are too high, the farmers may prefer individual contracts, even if the rejection rates are high. At higher prices, they have an incentive to organize the collection and transport of the pepper through the group. The model shows that the firm should not overuse its bargaining power beyond this self-enforcing price range as the farmers might easily breach the contracts. Furthermore, group contracting can be beneficial for risk-averse farmers in either the low or high season. We also simulate what type of governance structure is chosen when the selling price is endogenously established in the model and the income of the processing firm and the farmers is maximized. This analysis demonstrates that under certain conditions the incomes of the monopsonic processing firm and the farmers' association are jointly maximized by a group contract, enforced by low opportunistic behavior from both agents. The model shows that the processing firm is better-off dealing with a group contract instead of a multiple set of smaller individual contracts when farmers show low opportunistic behavior; even in the monopsonistic market situation. The latter outcome is important in the sense that collective action might be needed only under certain market conditions, but not all the time. The model forecasts a breach of the group contract under conditions of low supply of fresh pepper just because it becomes too expensive or unattractive. However, if the production remains stable throughout the year, with regular weekly supplies and limited season variation, group contracts will be preferred all the time. For the future development of pepper production in Costa Rica, an increase in productivity and stabilization of production throughout the year is required, with the aim of increasing (and especially stabilizing) the frequency of transactions, to improve the trust between actors, encourage low opportunistic behavior, and thereby strengthening the prospects for vertical integration between the parties. This can be done by changing the present market-specification contract for a production-management contract. Otherwise, under irregular supply through the year seasonal contracts will be still the best scenario. In Chapter 6 we present the most important findings of this thesis and some related policy implications. The present research emphasized in the analysis of supply chains for the pepper and chayote case studies by focusing on differences in the characteristics of the commodities as well as the types of farm households and the derived implications for market configuration and contract choice. This comparison enabled us to yield insights on the endogenous character of the selected contractual arrangements (Escobal et al., 2000) and draw pertinent conclusions regarding the efficiency and equity effects of supply chain cooperation. Our analysis of farmers' contract choice in both supply chains led us to identify three major functions of contracts, namely (1) a security device to enable farmers to take up a new production activity and to gain access to specialized markets; (2) a provision of incentives for investment and thus increase the asset-specificity on the farmer's side; and (3) a provision of information about the structure of the market where they operate, which is very important to prevent false expectations and adverse selection problems. These functions yield certain effects on the farmers' decisions regarding resource allocation and supply chain integration. We therefore discussed the implications of contracts for guaranteeing smallholder access (equity), for production efficiency, and for the long-term sustainability of supply chain cooperation. Finally, we draw some public and private roles for enhancing supply chain integration. While contracts are essentially private, there is still an important place for public action to safeguard the efficiency, equity and sustainability of supply chain cooperation. Contract farming can become an integral part of agrarian policy-making, where the government, together with farmers and firms, joins efforts and interests in order to promote an inclusive strategy of local sustainable development. This strategy should include public interventions for regulating market access (i. e. definition of a framework for legal enforcement and recourse), providing information and control (i. e. definition of minimum public grades and standards), and promoting farmers' organization. Moreover, governmental support is required for supply chain coordination towards product and process upgrading are of utmost importance. Through these interventions, a framework can be implemented to enhance bargaining power and reduce the institutional risk for smallholder producers willing to participate in contract farming.

Finally, DNA was found to accumulate in Dnase 2 a−/− or autophagy-deficient cells and induce inflammation via the Sting cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway. Our results reveal a cell-autonomous process for removal of damaged nuclear DNA with implications for conditions with elevated DNA damage, such as inflammation, cancer, and chemotherapy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{exchange}} rate volatility on export in Nigeria. The paper employed three models, viz: Ordinary Least Square (OLS); Granger causality test; and ARCH and GARCH techniques and also Augmented Dickey-Fuller technique was used in testing the presence of unit root. The results of unit root suggested that all the variables in the model are stationary at first difference, while causality test revealed that there is causation between export and exchange rate in the country, but the causation flows from exchange rate to export. Thus, exchange rate causes export. Furthermore, ARCH and GARCH results suggested that the exchange rate is volatile nevertheless export {{is found to be}} non-volatile. The study further showed that exchange rate is impacting positively on export, as shown by the regression results. The elasticity results revealed that, the demand for Nigerian products in the World market is fairly elastic. Therefore, for export to improve and foreign exchange earnings increase, the country should depreciate its currency, thereby reducing the price of its products so as to increase demand, which is changing from import-led to export-led economy. Consequently, in order to improve <b>exports,</b> efficient <b>delivery</b> services are needed, such as; power supply, energy resources and infrastructure. The significance of this paper is that, it stands to be a guide to policy makers. It has also push forward empirical discourse and provided literature to future research. Finally, this research recommends th...|$|R
30|$|The paper puts {{forward a}} {{new view of}} oil {{blending}} capacity and verifies the linear relationship of mixing oil concentration and oil blending capacity. The paper also presents a new method for detailed scheduling of oil depots along a product pipeline based on a MILP model. The model established in this paper considers the issues such as differences of oil physical properties, the growth of contaminated-oil batches, the type of contaminated oil and the different operation modes in oil depots and those issues make the formulation more practicable but more complex. The model, aiming at solving the minimum cost scheduling of oil depots system, takes the cost of blending and fractionation {{as well as the}} operation of oil and contaminated oil tanks into consideration. The MILP model, considering the constraints of <b>delivery,</b> <b>export,</b> blending, fractionation, maintenance, switching, oil and contaminated oil tank, contaminated oil batch and time node, is solved by MATLAB 2014.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a result of a wider policy {{research}} and knowledge work on growth and jobs issues in South Africa, which the Bank promotes in collaboration with leading South African researchers. The objective is to contribute to major economic and policy issues facing South Africa as it embarks on the second decade of its democratic transition. These issues include growth and jobs, <b>export</b> competitiveness, service <b>delivery,</b> small and medium-size enterprise development and investment climate, industrial concentration, infrastructure and growth, municipal and financial management, land reform, regional integration, trade and poverty, HIV/AIDS, and––especially important––service delivery. This paper examines industry concentration for the South African manufacturing sector over the 1972 - 1996 period (including the last year of the last manufacturing industry census data available) for the three-digit industry classification. The paper documents both the high level of industry concentration in South African manufacturing, and a rising trend in concentration across a wide range of industries. The paper furthe...|$|R

The paper provides three principal results. First, it evaluates {{the extent to which the}} composition and level of manufacturing exports have responded to reform initiatives in the 1990 s and finds that the successes of these policies in generating export growth have been mixed; the inability to re-structure exports towards dynamic, high-technology products is one explanation for the relatively poor export performance of South Africa...|$|R
40|$|Pompe {{disease is}} an {{inherited}} lysosomal storage disorder {{that results from}} a deficiency in acid a-glucosidase (GAA) activity due to mutations in the GAA gene. Pompe disease is characterized by accumulation of lysosomal glycogen primarily in heart and skeletal muscles, which leads to progressive muscle weakness. We have shown previously that the small molecule pharmacological chaperone AT 2220 (1 -deoxynojirimycin hydrochloride, duvoglustat hydrochloride) binds and stabilizes wild-type as well as multiple mutant forms of GAA, {{and can lead to}} higher cellular levels of GAA. In this study, we examined the effect of AT 2220 on mutant GAA, in vitro and in vivo, with a primary focus on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -retained P 545 L mutant form of human GAA (P 545 L GAA). AT 2220 increased the specific activity of P 545 L GAA toward both natural (glycogen) and artificial substrates in vitro. Incubation with AT 2220 also increased the ER <b>export,</b> lysosomal <b>delivery,</b> proteolytic processing, and stability of P 545 L GAA. In a new transgenic mouse model of Pompe disease that expresses human P 545 L on a Gaa knockout background (Tg/KO) and is characterized by reduced GAA activity and elevated glycogen levels in disease-relevant tissues, daily oral administration of AT 2220 for 4 weeks resulted in significant and dose-dependent increases in mature lysosomal GAA isoforms and GAA activity in heart and skeletal muscles. Importantly, oral administration of AT 2220 also resulted in significant glycogen reduction in disease-relevant tissues. Compared to daily administration, less-frequent AT 2220 administration, including repeated cycles of 4 or 5 days with AT 2220 followed by 3 or 2 days without drug...|$|R
30|$|Oil depots along {{products}} pipelines {{are important}} {{components of the}} pipeline transportation system and down-stream markets. The operating costs of oil depots account for {{a large proportion of}} the total system’s operating costs. Meanwhile, oil depots and pipelines form an entire system, and each operation in a single oil depot may have influence on others. It is a tough job to make a scheduling plan when considering the factors of delivering contaminated oil and batches migration. So far, studies simultaneously considering operating constraints and contaminated oil issues are rare. Aiming at making a scheduling plan with the lowest operating costs, the paper establishes a mixed-integer linear programming model, considering a sequence of operations, such as <b>delivery,</b> <b>export,</b> blending, fractionating and exchanging operations, and batch property differences of the same oil as well as influence of batch migration on contaminated volume. Moreover, the paper verifies the linear relationship between oil concentration and blending capability by mathematical deduction. Finally, the model is successfully applied to one of the product pipelines in China and proved to be practical.|$|R
40|$|From the {{viewpoint}} of GATS, challenges emerging from Mode 4 of supply are two pronged – measurement of value of services delivered through Mode 4 and statistical record of movement of persons to deliver services. The existing reporting system in India provides information on the purpose of transactions; the modes of supply of services are not considered. However, based {{on the nature of}} delivery of services, these can be broadly identified under specific modes of supply. Some measurement of mode of supply is possible in respect of software services. Onsite software exports – services performed at the site in the host country – which account for 41 per cent of the value of <b>exports,</b> would involve <b>delivery</b> either through natural movement of persons or through contractual employment of residents of the host country. An important issue emerging from the Indian experience is that proper identification and classification of remittances repatriated by the migrant workers would be crucial under the GATS to assess the services delivered through Mode 4. In case of countries where a significant share of migrant workers is constituted by unskilled/semi-skille...|$|R
40|$|Campylobacter jejuni is {{a leading}} cause of {{bacterial}} gastroenteritis worldwide. Acute C. jejuni-mediated disease (campylobacteriosis) involves C. jejuni invasion of host epithelial cells using a set of virulence proteins known as the Campylobacter invasion antigens (Cia). The genes encoding the Cia proteins are up-regulated upon co-culture of C. jejuni with epithelial cells. One of the Cia proteins, CiaC, is required for maximal invasion of host cells by C. jejuni. Previous work has also revealed that CiaC is, in part, responsible for host cell cytoskeletal rearrangements that result in membrane ruffling. This study was performed to test the hypothesis that CiaC is delivered to the cytosol of host cells. To detect the delivery of CiaC into cultured epithelial cells, we used the adenylate cyclase domain (ACD) of Bordetella pertussis CyaA as a reporter. In this study, we found that <b>export</b> and <b>delivery</b> of the C. jejuni Cia proteins into human INT 407 epithelial cells required a functional flagellar hook complex composed of FlgE, FlgK, and FlgL. Assays performed with bacterial culture supernatants supported the hypothesis that CiaC delivery requires bacteria-host cell contact. We also found that that CiaC was delivered to host cells by cell-associated (bound) bacteria, as judged by experiments performed with inhibitors that specifically target the cell signaling pathways utilized by C. jejuni for cell invasion. Interestingly, the C. jejuni flgL mutant, which is incapable of exporting and delivering the Cia proteins, did not induce INT 407 cell membrane ruffles. Complementation of the flgL mutant with plasmid-encoded flgL restored the motility and membrane ruffling. These data support the hypothesis that the C. jejuni Cia proteins, which are exported from the flagellum, are delivered to the cytosol of host cells...|$|R
40|$|Acclimation of leaf {{features}} to growth temperature {{was investigated in}} two biennials (whose life cycle spans summer and winter seasons) using different mechanisms of sugar loading into exporting conduits, Verbascum phoeniceum (employs sugar-synthesizing enzymes driving symplastic loading through plasmodesmatal wall pores of phloem cells) and Malva neglecta (likely apoplastic loader transporting sugar via membrane transport proteins of phloem cells). In both species, acclimation to lower temperature involved greater maximal photosynthesis rates and vein density per leaf area in close correlation with modification of minor vein cellular features. While the symplastically loading biennial exhibited adjustments {{in the size of}} minor leaf vein cells (consistent with adjustment of the level of sugar-synthesizing enzymes), the putative apoplastic biennial exhibited adjustments in the number of cells (consistent with adjustment of cell membrane area for transporter placement). This upregulation of morphological and anatomical features at lower growth temperature likely contributes to the success of both the species during the winter. Furthermore, while acclimation to low temperature involved greater leaf mass per area in both species, this resulted from greater leaf thickness in V. phoeniceum vs a greater number of mesophyll cells per leaf area in M. neglecta. Both types of adjustments presumably accommodate more chloroplasts per leaf area contributing to photosynthesis. Both biennials exhibited high foliar vein densities (particularly the solar-tracking M. neglecta), which should aid both sugar <b>export</b> from and <b>delivery</b> of water to the leaves...|$|R

Nissan tried to convert the Greek plant into one manufacturing cars for all European countries however due to issues with the Greek government not only did that not happen but the plant itself was closed. After an extensive review, Sunderland in the north east of England was chosen for its skilled workforce and its location near major ports. The plant was completed in 1986 as the subsidiary Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK) Ltd. By 2007, it was producing 400,000 vehicles per year, landing it {{the title of the}} most productive plant in Europe.In 2001, Nissan established a manufacturing plant in Brazil. In 2005, Nissan added operations in India, through its subsidiary Nissan Motor India Pvt. Ltd. With its global alliance partner, Renault, Nissan invested $990 million to set up a manufacturing facility in Chennai, catering to the Indian market as well as a base for exports of small cars to Europe.Nissan entered the Middle East market in 1957 when it sold its first car in Saudi Arabia. Nissan sold nearly 520,000 new vehicles in China in 2009 in a joint venture with Dongfeng Motor. To meet increased production targets, Dongfeng-Nissan expanded its production base in Guangzhou, which would become Nissan's largest factory around the globe in terms of production capacity. Nissan also has moved and expanded its Nissan Americas Inc. headquarters, moving from Los Angeles to Franklin, Tennessee in the Nashville area.|$|R
40|$|Educational {{services}} have become Australia&# 039;s third largest <b>export</b> industry. Onshore <b>delivery</b> {{of higher education}} {{has been a major}} export for many years, and in recent years offshore delivery of vocational education and training has grown to become a major part of this industry. Different Australian educational institutions are involved in delivery of Australian VET programs {{in a wide range of}} cultural and socioeconomic contexts. Because of the strong demand for skills in an increasingly interconnected world, this growing industry, which at an international level encompasses a diverse range of institutions, training delivery methods and management and administrative arrangements, is increasingly directing its attention towards globalising its regulatory and training approaches. The aim of this research is to investigate the process of adapting Training Packages and the Australian Quality Training Framework, the two main instruments of regulation in the Australian skill formation system, for an international audience. This thesis will examine what process of adaptation is involved when the Australian VET approaches are used as a model to develop skills formation overseas. Factors influencing the forms taken by this regulatory system in a global context will be studied through investigating the international activities of various Australian sectors in implementation of VET approaches in non-Australian systems. Two propositions underpin this key question. First is that the Australian VET system is primarily a regulatory system, which means that the export of these regulations needs to be accounted for. Secondly, the Australian VET system has been designed for Australian industrial and cultural conditions and adjustments are necessary in the regulations themselves, host country regulatory practice, or both for Training Packages to work in these non-Australian cultural contexts...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} German-Soviet {{economic and political}} relations from 1939 to 1941. These were forms of totalitarian regimes whose cooperation was not suspended though its own dynamics were influenced by ideological, economic, and political conditions. One of the motives for the intensification of German-Soviet cooperation was Germany's attempt to secure self-sufficiency {{in the development of}} raw materials. The German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact of August 23 rd, 1939 was a calculated accord with precise objectives when in both systems common national interests, which consisted also in the partition of Poland, overshadowed their ideological differences. This work outlines the circumstances of the negotiations, the main actors, and motives leading {{to the creation of the}} most significant trade agreements. It quantifies the Soviet <b>deliveries</b> <b>exported</b> to the German economy in the given period and analyzes the fulfillment of contractual obligations. A barely two-year business relationship in which Reich Foreign Ministry was significantly engaged provided more short-term benefits to the German war economy, especially in quantitative terms. It helped Hitler, among others, partially solve the import dependency. With regard to the structure of trade, the Stalinist regime was particularly important for the Nazi economy because of imports of raw materials and food. Reciprocally, Hitler's Germany represented a notable source of technologies and arms production. Business contracts completion was affected by military operations, strategic plans, contract terms and conditions, and other factors. In the last part, the thesis analyzes the German economic situation in the occupied territories of the USSR in the years 1941 - 1943 with respect to the area of present-day Ukraine and Belarus. The aim was to answer the question of whether the planned economic goals were achieved, and to characterize the most important factors influencing German economic gains. Part of this research was an analysis of the overall balance of obtained minerals, food, and labor in order to provide an answer to the question whether it was worth it, in purely quantitative terms, for Germany to terminate economic cooperation and attack the Soviet Union. Military action was motivated by economic objectives, while there is no doubt about the racially ideological background. In the elaboration and implementation of occupation policy representatives of the industrial and banking sectors or the Reich's ministries were actively involved. Benefits expected from the economic occupation of the Soviet territory were not realized. Efficiency and goals achievement were complicated by evacuation and collaboration, also corruption, guerrilla activities, and the concept of occupation policy...|$|R
