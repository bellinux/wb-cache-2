50|$|The {{border is}} {{agreed to be}} {{regularly}} inspected every 25 years. During the <b>independence</b> <b>of</b> Finland, <b>inspections</b> {{have been made in}} 1926-1927, 1956-1957, 1981 and 2006. These inspections include inspecting the course of the border, repairing the border signs if needed, and defining the location of the deepest parts of the river through aerial and terrestrial photography. Especially in the wide, sandbanked areas of the rivers, the deepest parts shift in location. If the deepest part has shifted, the border may be shifted accordingly. For example, in the 2006 inspection, the border was shifted in many places, usually by 10 to 20 metres, but in some places up to 100 metres. A similar total area was moved from one country to another in both directions.|$|R

For all regression models, we ensured that the assumptions of the regression models were met in the following manner. Linearity was assessed through visual <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> partial regression plots and a plot of studentized residuals against the predicted values. Homoscedasticity was assessed by visual <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> a plot of studentized residuals versus unstandardized predicted values. Normality was assessed by visual <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> the P–P plot.

Empirical analysis <b>of</b> 'BestValue' <b>inspections</b> <b>of</b> local government suggests that the processes <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> were transparent and applied in a reasonably consistent manner. However, the direct and indirect costs were high; the fragmented nature <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> regimes posed significant problems for inspected bodies; the adversarial nature <b>of</b> <b>inspections</b> militated against self-assessment; and there was little meaningful involvement by service users...|$|R

Therefore, the location <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> stations together with the allocation <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> time available at any inspection station, particularly in multistage systems where several parts are produced, is an important problem.

40|$|The {{quality of}} many goods and {{services}} may change randomly between the time of shipment and delivery, creating disputes over quality that can result in lemons-market equilibria. We investigate the potential <b>of</b> third-party <b>inspections</b> for such inefficiencies. We consider two types <b>of</b> <b>inspection,</b> ex post verification of quality in consignment contracts and ex ante certification in FOB contracts, which were instituted for fruits and vegetables in the U. S. when national markets were emerging. We show that both types <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> can counteract misallocations of quality found in lemons-market equilibria. Buyers prefer ex post verification to ex ante certification while sellers prefer the reverse. Government provision <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> services may be necessary for making provision <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> services economically viable, and may be desirable for reducing inefficiencies due to the costliness <b>of</b> <b>inspection.</b> The U.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel {{treatment}} of the inspection-system design problem when inspection is unreliable and subject to classification errors. Our approach, based on the theory of Error-Correcting Codes (ECC), leads to the development <b>of</b> a Self-Correcting <b>Inspection</b> (SCI) decision rule that does not require complete knowledge <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> error probabilities. We show that the proposed rule assures correct classification, if the number <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> errors {{is less than a}} certain number. We analyze the performance of the SCI decision rule under different inspection situations, including some situations that are uncommon in the field of error-correcting codes. Then, we show how the underlying mathematical structure can be applied to determine the number <b>of</b> <b>inspections</b> and the level <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> reliability in order to minimize the sum of inspection-related costs. The practical contribution of this work lies in that it expands the ability of the designer <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> systems to deal with cases where there is very little or no information regarding the reliability <b>of</b> the <b>inspection</b> operations. 1.

40|$|Inspection {{has been}} an {{increasingly}} important feature of central monitoring {{of education in the}} 1990 s. This article examines the technical reliability <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> processes in initial teacher training, drawing extensively on methodology and procedures adopted by the Office for Standards in Education (OFSTED) between 1996 and 1998. A definition of reliability is advanced and tested against the procedures <b>of</b> <b>inspection,</b> especially by examining the security of internal and external judgements at the pass/fail borderline and the moderation and training procedures deployed by OFSTED. The methodology <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> is found to be insufficiently reliable for the consequences which flow from it. Tensions are explored between the technicist model <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> underlying OFSTED initial teacher training procedures and the 'informed conoisseurship' model hitherto deployed by members of Her Majesty's Inspectorate. In consequence, there are unresolved tensions between the expressed aspiration for 'improvement through inspection' and the use <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> to police compliance...|$|R

40|$|The {{principle}} of proportionality applies to competition proceedings especially, {{when it comes to}} the exercise by the competition authority of its powers <b>of</b> <b>inspection.</b> Their use limits the economic freedom and right to privacy of the scrutinised undertakings in order to protect free competition. The use <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> powers must thus be proportionate and remain the least onerous possible for the inspected companies.
