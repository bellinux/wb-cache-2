Glacial volcanism is a good indicator of past ice distribution, making it an important climatic marker. Since they are <b>imbedded</b> <b>in</b> ice, as ice retracts worldwide there are concerns that tuyas and other structures may destabalize, resulting in mass landslides.

She argues that the metal bars piercing his wrists and ankles are similar to the nails that held Jesus, the metal straps <b>imbedded</b> <b>in</b> his head are similar to the Crown of Thorns, and that his vivisection is reminiscent of the wound made by the Holy Lance. Furthermore, Bush parallels Jesus' [...] "horrific death in order to rise again" [...] to Mulder's abduction, death, and resurrection later on in [...] "Deadalive", which would further make allusions to the Christ-like nature of Mulder.|$|E
