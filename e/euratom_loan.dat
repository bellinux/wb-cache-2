In practice, their main effect would be to force countries all over Europe either to accept Yucca Mountain-style nuclear waste dumps in their country, or else take part in multi-country dump plans. At the same time, the Commission wants to increase the <b>Euratom</b> <b>Loan</b> ceiling by 2 billion Euros. (576. 5453) WISE Amsterdam – The new proposals were released the week before a “double-size ” nuclear waste transport – 12 Castors instead of 6 – is set to take place from France to Germany’s Gorleben nuclear waste site, to be met by thousands of protesters. Despite the opposition to Gorleben and the U. S. Yucca Mountain, the European Commission wants to set deadlines for all EU member states, including the newly-joining countries in Central and Eastern Europe, to set up similar dumps in their country, unless they take part in multicountry dump site plans. IN THIS ISSUE: The proposals, released on 6 November 2002, are for deep geological “disposal facilities ” into which nuclear waste is dumped {{with the intention of}} leaving it there forever. According to the draft directive, “indefinite surface or nearsurface storage of spent nuclear fuel that is not to be reprocessed is not considered an acceptable method of long-term management”. The proposed deadlines for these “Euro-dumps ” are: 2008 for deciding on a high-level waste dump, which must be put into operation by 2018; and 2013 for putting into operation “disposal facilities ” for “low-level, short-life ” radioactive waste. These deadlines are extremely tight – for example, a German government commission has set deadlines 12 years later than these for high-level waste “disposal ” (see article “Fierce debate over German waste plans ” i...|$|E
