5|$|The <b>design</b> <b>challenges</b> the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair (C) {{faced with}} this class were considerable, as the {{combined}} requirements of optimum hitting power, extreme speed and adequate protection taxed the knowledge of its naval architects and technology of the time. The desired speed of 35knots, for example, had been previously attained only in destroyers and smaller craft. To do so with a capital ship required a hull and a power plant of unprecedented size for a U.S. naval vessel, in addition to careful planning by its designers to ensure it would have enough longitudinal strength to withstand both bending forces while underway and any stress that might occur in combat. It took years between initial and final designs for engine and boiler technology to provide a plant of sufficient power that was also compact enough to allow a practical degree of protection, even in such large ships.|$|E

25|$|Contemporary {{applications}} face many <b>design</b> <b>challenges</b> {{when considering}} exception handling strategies. Particularly in modern enterprise level applications, exceptions must often cross process boundaries and machine boundaries. Part of designing a solid exception handling strategy is recognizing when a process {{has failed to}} the point where it cannot be economically handled by the software portion of the process.|$|E
30|$|The {{engineering}} <b>design</b> <b>challenge</b> {{occurred on}} the final day of the workshop after participants had been exposed to engineering and engineering design-based STEM experiences on the previous day. The goal of this task was for participants to have an opportunity to extend and apply the knowledge obtained from previous PD tasks and discussions. Specifically, participants would engage with an engineering <b>design</b> <b>challenge,</b> work collaboratively to enhance the challenge to be more representative of engineering-design-based STEM instruction by tailoring it to grade level science and mathematics content, and then enact their version of the <b>design</b> <b>challenge</b> in the classroom. In recognizing that the triads are composed of multiple grade levels with different standards, the Hexbug <b>design</b> <b>challenge</b> was chosen due to the fact that there is a range of math and science concepts that can be integrated into this engineering <b>design</b> <b>challenge.</b>|$|R

25|$|Because of the <b>design</b> <b>challenges</b> and {{sensitivity}} to a site that are required to efficiently meet the energy needs of a building and occupants with renewable energy (solar, wind, geothermal, etc.), designers must apply holistic design principles, {{and take advantage of}} the free naturally occurring assets available, such as passive solar orientation, natural ventilation, daylighting, thermal mass, and night time cooling.|$|E
25|$|Scramjet (supersonic {{combustion}} ramjet) engines {{present a}} much different situation for the combustor than conventional gas turbine engines (scramjets are not gas turbines, they generally have few or no moving parts). While scramjet combustors may be physically quite different from conventional combustors, they face {{many of the same}} <b>design</b> <b>challenges,</b> like fuel mixing and flame holding. However, as its name implies, a scramjet combustor must address these challenges in a supersonic flow environment. For example, for a scramjet flying at Mach 5, the air flow entering the combustor would nominally be Mach 2. One of the major challenges in a scramjet engine is preventing shock waves generated by combustor from traveling upstream into the inlet. If that were to happen, the engine may unstart, resulting in loss of thrust, amongst other problems. To prevent this, scramjet engines tend to have an isolator section (see image) immediately ahead of the combustion zone.|$|E

25|$|At Central Station, the new {{dedicated}} U9 platform {{would be}} placed underneath the current S-Bahn platforms but above U4/U5 platform and new second S-Bahn platforms, and underneath the heavy rail tracks. This could allow for a mezzanine level above the U9 platform to connect not only to other U- and S-Bahn lines, but to the western ends of the heavy rail platforms {{including those of the}} heavy rail annexes which flank the main platforms of the central station, meaning improved connections in particular of the annexes. There are serious engineering and <b>design</b> <b>challenges</b> in building a fifth line under the Central Station if quick transfers with the existing two S-Bahn lines and two U-Bahn lines are to be achieved. Possible cost increases from technical challenges at Münchner Freiheit, where the U9 was to have rejoined the U3/U6 line in an earlier proposal for the line, have been mitigated by having the line reconnect one station south at Giselastraße instead.|$|E

Although they did not use the term [...] "design management", they stressed identical issues; while the design community discussed methodologies for design. Christopher Alexander's work {{played an important role in}} the development of the design methodology, where he devoted his attention to the problems of form and context; and focused on disassembling complex <b>design</b> <b>challenges</b> into constituent parts to approach a solution. His intention was to bring more rationalism and structure into the solving of design problems.|$|E

2500|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{diffuser}} is to slow the high speed, highly compressed, air from the compressor to a velocity optimal for the combustor. Reducing the velocity results in an unavoidable loss in total pressure, {{so one of the}} <b>design</b> <b>challenges</b> is to limit the loss of pressure as much as possible. Furthermore, the diffuser must be designed to limit the flow distortion as much as possible by avoiding flow effects like boundary layer separation. Like most other gas turbine engine components, the diffuser is designed to be as short and light as possible.|$|E
2500|$|The LFTR {{concept was}} first {{investigated}} at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment in the 1960s, though the MSRE {{did not use}} thorium. It has recently {{been the subject of}} a renewed interest worldwide. Japan, China, the UK and private US, Czech, Canadian and Australian companies have expressed intent to develop and commercialize the technology. LFTRs differ from other power reactors in almost every aspect: they use thorium that is turned into uranium rather than uranium directly, receive fuel by pumping without shutdown, use a salt coolant and produce higher operating temperatures. [...] These distinctive characteristics give rise to many potential advantages, as well as <b>design</b> <b>challenges.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The SFR reactor {{concept is}} cooled by liquid sodium and {{fueled by a}} {{metallic}} alloy of uranium and plutonium or spent nuclear fuel, the [...] "nuclear waste" [...] of light water reactors. The SFR fuel is contained in steel cladding with liquid sodium filling {{in the space between}} the clad elements which make up the fuel assembly. One of the <b>design</b> <b>challenges</b> of an SFR is the risks of handling sodium, which reacts explosively if it comes into contact with water. However, the use of liquid metal instead of water as coolant allows the system to work at atmospheric pressure, reducing the risk of leakage.|$|E
2500|$|Development of {{the power}} cycle - Developing a large helium or {{supercritical}} carbon dioxide turbine is needed for highest efficiency. These gas cycles offer numerous potential advantages for use with molten salt-fueled or molten salt-cooled reactors. These closed gas cycles face <b>design</b> <b>challenges</b> and engineering upscaling work for a commercial turbine-generator set. A standard supercritical steam turbine could be used at a small penalty in efficiency (the net efficiency of the MSBR {{was designed to be}} approximately 44%, using an old 1970s steam turbine). A molten salt to steam generator would still have to be developed. Currently, molten nitrate salt steam generators are used in concentrated solar thermal power plants such as Andasol in Spain. Such a generator could be used for an MSR as a third circulating loop, where it would also trap any tritium that diffuses through the primary and secondary heat exchanger ...|$|E
