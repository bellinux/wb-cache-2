25|$|The worst {{installations}} {{are those}} where the siren sound is emitted above and slightly behind the vehicle occupants such as cases where a light-bar mounted speaker {{is used on}} a sedan or pickup. Vehicles with concealed sirens also tend to have <b>high</b> <b>noise</b> levels inside. In some cases, concealed or poor installations produce noise levels which can permanently damage vehicle occupants' hearing.|$|E
25|$|The airline was {{purchased}} by SAS Group in January 1998, who replaced its Jetstreams with Saab 340s later that year. Air Botnia received its first jets, Fokker F28 Fellowships, in 1999. The elderly F28s were soon replaced as their <b>high</b> <b>noise</b> levels restricted operations, with Avro RJ85s being received in 2001. The Saab 340s were replaced by larger Saab 2000s at the same time.|$|E
30|$|Many robust filters for {{impulse noise}} removal have been {{proposed}} in the literature {{but most of them}} which work efficiently in the lower noise ratio, lack considerably in the <b>higher</b> <b>noise</b> ratio. Filters like CWVMF, CWVDF, CWDDF, RCTVDF, RCTVDF, RCTDDF etc. which perform very well in the lowest noise ratio group, are not efficient in the <b>higher</b> <b>noise</b> ratio group. On the other hand filters like ASVMF_MEAN, ASDDF_MEAN and EVMF work quite well both in lowest and <b>highest</b> <b>noise</b> ratio group.|$|R

25|$|A 1988 {{commission}} considered Eggemoen as {{a potential}} site for a new main air station for fighter aircraft in Eastern Norway. Although it had sufficient area for construction, an air station {{would have to be}} built {{on both sides of the}} Randsfjorden Line. The proximity to Hønefoss and Jevnaker would incur <b>high</b> <b>noise</b> pollution. Investments would be high as the entire runway would have to be rotated ten degrees.|$|E
25|$|There were {{a number}} of foreign {{customers}} for the SB. They were mostly satisfied with the aircraft's performance. There were some complaints about the <b>high</b> <b>noise</b> level, cramped crew compartments, hard undercarriage suspension and in particular about the front gunner's position, which could be reached only through a hatch under the fuselage, preventing the gunner from escaping {{in the event of a}} ditching or belly landing. Czechoslovakia signed an agreement to produce ANT-40 as Avia B-71.|$|E
25|$|Morse code {{is usually}} heard at the {{receiver}} as a medium-pitched on/off audio tone (600–1000Hz), so transmissions {{are easier to}} copy than voice through the noise on congested frequencies, {{and it can be}} used in very <b>high</b> <b>noise</b> / low signal environments. The transmitted power is concentrated into a limited bandwidth so narrow receiver filters can be used to suppress interference from adjacent frequencies. The audio tone is usually created by use of a beat frequency oscillator.|$|E

25|$|The Toshiba SD-L902A for {{notebooks}} {{was one of}} the first available HD DVD writers, although it was not meant for retail. Burning HD DVD (including Dual Layer) with a 1× write speed, it could also burn DVDs and CDs. In a test of the SD-L902A by C't computer magazine with Verbatim discs, the written HD DVD-Rs suffered from <b>high</b> <b>noise</b> levels, as a result, the written discs could not be recognized by the external HD DVD drive of the Xbox 360, though they could be read back by the SD-L902A.|$|E
25|$|The modern uses of radar {{are highly}} diverse, {{including}} air and terrestrial traffic control, radar astronomy, air-defence systems, antimissile systems, marine radars to locate landmarks and other ships, aircraft anticollision systems, ocean surveillance systems, outer space surveillance and rendezvous systems, meteorological precipitation monitoring, altimetry and flight control systems, guided missile target locating systems, ground-penetrating radar for geological observations, and range-controlled radar {{for public health}} surveillance. High tech radar systems are associated with digital signal processing, machine learning and are capable of extracting useful information from very <b>high</b> <b>noise</b> levels.|$|E
25|$|In Bamberg {{the upgrade}} plans caused protests among the citizens, as DB planned to build <b>high</b> <b>noise</b> barriers. Subsequently, the plans were rejected. Three new options {{emerged from a}} dialogue: {{optimised}} new noise protection on the existing route, which would be lowered at sensitive points, a tunnel for freight trains or a complete bypass of Bamberg to the east through the main stretch of carr (marshy forest), parallel to the A73. The current draft of the Federal Transport Plan (Bundesverkehrswegeplan) for 2030 includes the bypass along the A 73 because it has the best benefit/cost ratio.|$|E
30|$|A new {{adaptive}} switching {{algorithm is}} presented where two adaptive filters are switched correspondingly for lower and <b>higher</b> <b>noise</b> {{ratio of the}} image. An adaptive center weighted vector median filter {{is used for the}} lower noise ratio whereas for <b>higher</b> <b>noise</b> ratio the noisy pixels are detected based on the comparison of the difference between the mean of the vector pixels in the window and the approximated variance of the vector pixels in the window. Then the window comprising the detected noisy pixel is further considered where the pixels are given exponential weights according to their similarity to the other neighboring pixels, spatially and radio metrically. The noisy pixels are then replaced by the weighted average of the pixels within the window. The filter is able to preserve higher signal content in the <b>higher</b> <b>noise</b> ratio as compared to other robust filters in comparison. With a little high in computational complexity, this technique performs well both in lower and <b>higher</b> <b>noise</b> ratios. Simulation results on various RGB images show that the proposed algorithm outperforms many other existing nonlinear filters in terms of preservation of edges and fine details.|$|R
30|$|S 1 : block size, {{the block}} size is {{gradually}} increased with the <b>noise</b> level becoming <b>higher</b> and higher. The block matching can easily achieve better results as {{the noise level}} is low, so we use the smaller size, however, the <b>higher</b> <b>noise</b> level will significantly influence the block-matching accuracy, so we should utilize relatively bigger block size. N 1 : the number of blocks in each group, when noise level is low we use small number {{so as to guarantee}} the sufficient similarity among the matched blocks to better preserve weak texture and contour after denoising. The relatively bigger number for <b>higher</b> <b>noise</b> level to achieve the better denoising; T 1 : hard threshold, we use the same value in this stage, because this stage is just slightly denoising, we need not use different hard threshold whether lower or <b>higher</b> <b>noise</b> level, the common value is enough; γ: perturbation factor, the purpose of this parameter is to reduce the influential of the isolated strong noise, in other words, increase the block matching accuracy in the next step. With the increase of the noise level, the isolated strong noise will also be stronger, so we use the bigger value for <b>higher</b> <b>noise</b> level.|$|R
30|$|Then, we {{move into}} indoor environments, where we expect the {{localization}} accuracy to decrease a little due to the <b>higher</b> <b>noise</b> effect given by walls and furniture near the device to be localized and the BSs.|$|R
25|$|Nine Fokker F27s were bought, four from Trans Australia Airlines for $9.5 million. Services {{commenced}} on 17 December 1984 {{with the}} first four aircraft under the subbrand Eurolink—operating shorter hauls out of Copenhagen Airport. Initially this included routes to Oslo Airport, Fornebu; Göteborg Landvetter Airport; Haugesund Airport, Karmøy; Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik; Jönköping Airport and Hamburg Airport. The services to Hamburg {{was by far the}} busiest, with five to seven daily services. The old aircraft, built between 1967 and 1969, were unpopular with the customers because of low comfort, <b>high</b> <b>noise</b> levels and many technical problems. Customers would often complain when they realized they would have to travel with a F27 rather than a DC-9. A further five F27 were bought from Aero Trasporti Italiani in 1985, costing 70 million Swedish kronor (SEK).|$|E
25|$|In {{its early}} years, the Tu-134 {{developed}} a reputation for reliability and efficiency, especially when compared with previous Soviet designs. After the establishment of tougher noise standards in the ICAO regulations in 2002, the Tu-134 was banned from most western European airports for its <b>high</b> <b>noise</b> levels. In early 2006, 245 Tu-134s were still in operation, 162 of which were in Russia. After a fatal accident in March 2007, and at the instigation of Russian Minister of Transportation Igor Levitin, Aeroflot {{announced that it would}} be retiring its fleet, and the last Tu-134 was removed from service on 1 January 2008. Some are still in operations with Aeroflot subsidiaries on local routes within Russia. The Tu-134 also found a new life as a business jet with many having an expensive business interior installed. High fuel and maintenance costs are increasingly limiting the number used today.|$|E
500|$|SL95 is {{a series}} of 32 low-floor, {{articulated}} trams operated on the Oslo Tramway. The series is built by Ansaldo/Firema of Italy and delivered between 1999 and 2004. Capacity for the eight-axle, three-section vehicles is 212 passengers, of which 88 can be seated. The name derives from being ordered in 1995. Original plans called for the delivery to be between 1997 and 1998. Delivery took many years due to a magnitude of technical flaws, including <b>high</b> <b>noise</b> levels, freezing during the winter and corrosion.

30|$|S 3 : initial block size, we {{implement}} DCT on {{an initial}} 8 [*]×[*] 8 image, then use its AC component {{to decide the}} morphological component, then further adjust the block size according different morphological components; N 3 : the number of blocks in each group, the principle {{is the same as}} step 1; T 2 : hard threshold. Because we utilized bigger block size for <b>higher</b> <b>noise</b> level in step 1, the denoising performance is stronger than the lower noise level ones, so we use the relatively smaller hard threshold for <b>higher</b> <b>noise</b> level situations in this step to better preserve texture or contour details.|$|R
40|$|We {{measured}} {{the noise level}} in the training ship NAGASAKI-maru at underway and under ocean survey, and analyzed the frequency of noise. In the engine room causing the <b>noise,</b> the <b>highest</b> <b>noise</b> level was measured 112 dB near the main engine and the average noise level was 106 dB. In the accommodation space at underway, the <b>highest</b> <b>noise</b> level was measured 62. 4 dB in the cadet’s room on the tank top floor, the 2 nd <b>highest</b> <b>noise</b> level was 59. 4 dB in the crew’s room on the 2 nd deck floor and 54. 1 dB on the boat deck floor. The noise level decreases on the upper floor. In the accommodation space under ocean survey, the noise level on the upper deck floor and the boat deck floor showed almost no change compared with at underway. Under ocean survey the noise level was measured 69. 1 dB in the cadet’s room on the tank top floor and 65. 8 dB in the-crew’s room on the 2 nd deck floor. These noise levels were about 6. 5 dB-higher than at underway. The noise level was influenced considerably by-both the bow thruster and the stern thruster...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} proven that the noise-tuning-based {{hysteretic}} noisy chaotic neural network (NHNCNN) can use the noise tuning factor to improve the optimization performance obviously at lower initial noise levels while can not at initial <b>higher</b> <b>noise</b> levels. In order to improve the optimization performance of the NHNCNN at initial <b>higher</b> <b>noise</b> levels, we introduce a new noise tuning factor into the activation function and propose an improved hysteretic noisy chaotic neural network (IHNCNN) model. By regulating {{the value of the}} newly introduced noise tuning factor, both noise levels of the activation function and hysteretic dynamics in the IHNCNN can be adjusted to help to improve the global optimization ability as the initial <b>noise</b> amplitude is <b>higher.</b> As a result, the IHNCNN can exhibit better optimization performance at initial <b>higher</b> <b>noise</b> levels. In order to demonstrate the advantage of the IHNCNN over the NHNCNN, the IHNCNN combined with gradual expansion scheme (GES) is applied to solve broadcast scheduling problem (BSP) in wireless multihop networks (WMNs). The aim of BSP is to design an optimal time-division multiple-access (TDMA) frame structure with minimal frame length and maximal channel utilization. Simulation results in BSP show the superiority of the IHNCNN...|$|R
2500|$|In Germany in 2004, {{journalist}} Friedrich Mülln took undercover {{footage of}} staff in Covance in Münster, Europe's largest primate-testing center.

2500|$|The AI-20 is a {{single-shaft}} turboprop with a ten-stage {{axial compressor}} and a three-stage power turbine, {{and is designed}} to run at a constant speed. A big problem with early production engines was the poor reliability of the AI-20 engines, which had a time between overhauls (TBO) {{in the range of}} 600 to 750 hours. The AI-20K engine variant was finally introduced, with a TBO of 2,000 hours – unimpressive by modern standards, but a big improvement. One issue that was never addressed was noise; turboprops are relatively noisy and <b>high</b> <b>noise</b> levels were a [...] problem for the passengers. As mentioned, the overhaul life of the engine was initially poor compared with contemporary western engines, being reported as 600–750 hours in 1964, but was later improved by continuous development to 8,000 hours, with a service life of 22,000 hours in the AI-20D series 5M.|$|E
2500|$|The Gravity Probe B satellite, {{launched}} in 2004 and operated until 2005, detected frame-dragging and the geodetic effect. The experiment used four quartz spheres {{the size of}} ping pong balls coated with a superconductor. Data analysis continued through 2011 due to <b>high</b> <b>noise</b> levels and difficulties in modelling the noise accurately so that a useful signal could be found. Principal investigators at Stanford University reported on May 4, 2011, that they had accurately measured the frame dragging effect relative to the distant star IM Pegasi, and the calculations proved to be {{in line with the}} prediction of Einstein's theory. The results, published in Physical Review Letters measured the geodetic effect with an error of about 0.2 percent. The results reported the frame dragging effect (caused by Earth's rotation) added up to 37 milliarcseconds with an error of about 19 percent. Investigator Francis Everitt explained that a milliarcsecond [...] "is the width of a human hair seen at the distance of 10 miles".|$|E
50|$|The {{response}} of a coil/magnet geophone {{is proportional to}} ground velocity, while MEMS devices usually respond proportional toacceleration.

2500|$|To further {{increase}} {{capacity and}} regularity, the Norwegian National Rail Administration decided {{to rebuild the}} section from Stavanger to Sandnes to double track. The upgrade involved closing Hillevåg Station, and building three new stations: Paradis, Jåttåvågen and Gausel. Construction was estimated to cost 2.2 billion Norwegian krone. The primary goal {{of the project was}} to increase capacity and build stations in areas with transit-oriented development. Travel time between Stavanger and Sandnes was only reduced with four minutes. Construction was done by adding another tack adjacent to the existing one, rather than building a new right-of-way. The upgrades included the construction of [...] of low noise barriers and [...] of conventional <b>high</b> <b>noise</b> barriers. The upgrades were made {{in such a way that}} a future tram-train can run on the route. All intermediate stations were built in such a way that they later could be adapted to also serve the light rail service. The route is built to allow the light rail service to enter and leave the Jæren Line at Lura, Gausel, Hinna and Stavager.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{prototype}} Fanliner {{made its}} maiden flight on 8 October 1973. It was a mid-winged monoplane of all-metal construction with a fixed nosewheel undercarriage. The crew of two sat side-by-side in an enclosed cockpit which hinged on the centreline in a gull-wing door arrangement to give access. Dual controls were fitted. The engine, a [...] water-cooled Audi NSU wankel engine was positioned behind the cockpit, {{and drove the}} ducted fan situated behind the engine. The radiator for the engine was fitted in the aircraft's nose. The rear fuselage, which carried a T-tail, consisted of a narrow boom extended behind the fan duct, supported by triangular section beams in a cruciform arrangement. The aircraft's wings and horizontal tail surfaces were taken from a Grumman American AA-1, while the vertical tail surfaces were new. At first the fan was ungeared, which resulted in <b>high</b> <b>noise</b> levels. The engine {{was replaced by a}} [...] engine in 1974, and considerable testing was carried out with various designs of fans and reduction gearing {{in order to reduce the}} noise to acceptable levels. The use of a three-bladed fiberglass fan, with swept blades driven via a gearbox allowed noise levels to be reduced to well below the German statutory limits for light aircraft. The first prototype Fanliner, D-EJFL with makers number 001, was exhibited at the June 1975 Paris Air Show.|$|E

30|$|Some methods only employ {{filtering}} {{without the}} detection of impulse noise whereas certain other methods first employ {{the detection of}} the impulse noise followed by the filtering. Over the past two decades, performance of the nonlinear filters particularly the two-stage median-based filters has improved multifold for the images corrupted by RVIN [1]. The existing state-of-the-art methods have attempted to remove the RVIN in images but are successful only at lower <b>noise</b> densities. At <b>higher</b> <b>noise</b> densities of RVIN, the image restoration by these methods is not satisfactory. Hence, various applications {{which are based on}} image denoising like medical imaging, face recognition, satellite imaging, and fisheries are rendered ineffective. The main focus areas of this research are quality image restoration at <b>higher</b> <b>noise</b> densities of RVIN and achievement of lower computational cost of the proposed detection and filtering technique.|$|R
