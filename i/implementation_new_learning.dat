40|$|Many {{arguments}} {{have been}} made for and {{against the use of}} the <b>new</b> <b>learning</b> technologies in third-level education. This paper will start by briefly reviewing some of the rationales put forward for using the <b>new</b> teaching and <b>learning</b> technologies in higher education and some of the lessons which can be learnt from such a review. The paper will then outline the approach to implementing <b>new</b> <b>learning</b> technologies taken by one specific third level distance education institution i. e. the approach taken by Oscail – the National Distance Education Centre in Ireland. For over thirty years, Oscail has presented traditional distance education programmes. However, {{over the past four years}} it has been converting a number of these programmes to online programmes. One of the features of Oscail’s online implementation strategy is the development of different methods of teaching online to suit different subject areas. The paper will take as a case study a number of the methods used on one of its larger programmes. The paper will finish by looking at the real as distinct from theoretical benefits of using the <b>new</b> teaching and <b>learning</b> technologies in higher distance education and attempt to abstract from Oscail’s experience some likely directions for the <b>implementation</b> of <b>new</b> <b>learning</b> technologies in this area.

40|$|Abstract- Exploiting {{additional}} information to improve traditional inductive learning {{is an active}} research area in machine learning. In many supervised-learning applications, training data can be naturally separated into several groups, and incorporating this group information into learning may improve generalization. Recently, Vapnik [9] proposed general approach to formalizing such problems, known as Learning With Structured Data (LWSD) and its SVM-based optimization formulation called SVM+. Liang and Cherkassky [5, 6] showed empirical validation of SVM+ for classification, and its connections to Multi-Task Learning (MTL) approaches in machine learning. This paper builds upon this recent work [5, 6, 9] and describes a new methodology for regression problems, combining Vapnik's SVM+ regression [9] and the MTL classification setting [6], for regression problems. We also show empirical comparisons between standard SVM regression, SVM+, and proposed SVM+MTL regression method. Practical <b>implementation</b> of <b>new</b> <b>learning</b> technologies, such as SVM+, is often hindered by their complexity, i. e, large number of tuning parameters (vs standard inductive SVM regression). To this end, we provide a practical scheme for model selection that combines analytic selection of parameters for SVM regression [3] and resampling-based methods for selecting model parameters specific to SVM+ and SVM+MTL.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} has been to develop methods of improving the generalization capabilities of artificial neural networks. Tools for examining the influence of individual training set patterns on the learning abilities of individual neurons are put forth and utilized in the <b>implementation</b> of <b>new</b> network <b>learning</b> algorithms. Algorithms are based largely on the supervised training algorithm: backpropagation, and all experiments use the standard backpropagation algorithm for comparison of results. The focus of the <b>new</b> <b>learning</b> algorithms revolve around the addition of two main components. The first addition {{is that of a}}n unsupervised learning algorithm called flocking. Flocking attempts to provide network hyperplane divisions that are more evenly influenced by examples. The second addition is that of a multi-tasking approach called convergence training: initially, information provided by a clustering algorithm is used to create subtasks that represent divisions between clusters. These subtasks are then trained in unison in order to promote hyperplane sharing within the problem space. Generalization was improved in most cases and the solutions produced by the <b>new</b> <b>learning</b> algorithms are demonstrated to be very robust against different random weight initializations. This research is not only a search for better generalizing ANN learning algorithms, but also a search for better understanding when dealing with the complexities involved in ANN generalization...|$|R

These data have been interpreted to mean that projections from MDmc to prefrontal cortex are required to sustain normal prefrontal function {{in a variety of}} task settings. In the present study, we investigated the extent to which bilateral neurotoxic lesions of the MDmc impair a preoperatively learnt strategy implementation task that is impaired by a crossed lesion technique that disconnects the frontal cortex in one hemisphere from the contralateral inferotemporal cortex. Postoperative memory impairments were also examined using the object-in-place scene memory task. Monkeys learnt both strategy implementation and scene memory tasks separately to a stable level preoperatively. Bilateral neurotoxic lesions of the MDmc, produced by 10 x 1 microl injections of a mixture of ibotenate and NMDA did not affect performance in the strategy <b>implementation</b> task. However, <b>new</b> <b>learning</b> of object-in-place scene memory was substantially impaired.

Method: Activating affect, inhibitory affect (in session) and <b>new</b> <b>learning</b> (between sessions) were rated using Achievement of Therapeutic Objectives Scale (ATOS). These ratings were based on video-recorded therapy sessions from the Svartberg, Stiles, and Seltzer study (2004).

This {{project had}} two components, the {{evaluation}} of a Developing and Enhancing Leadership and Management Skills programme delivered to 150 frontline supervisory and senior managers in North Bristol NHS Trust and the implementation of guidelines for Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) in research. 2. Evaluation data were collected through three knowledge café events engaging 36 staff. These events were used to facilitate and record meaningful conversations that were focused around five questions. Follow-up {{interviews were conducted with}} a further 15 staff. 3. The PPI guidelines were applied throughout the project and the experiences of the two service users involved were recorded through ongoing dialogue and review of guideline implementation. 4. Data from the events and interviews suggested the programme had benefits for staff. These included the development of new insights and better understanding of the roles and experiences of other leaders in the Trust. Immediate and sustained outcomes were also reported for the individuals and organisation. Staff felt that they moved forward professionally and had insight into the “bigger picture”. They also welcomed delivery from external facilitators who had a refreshing approach. 5. Staff were also able to demonstrate <b>new</b> <b>learning.</b> In particular the programme had changed their approach to handling leadership issues and their use of tools and skills. Managers reported taking a different approach to the management of more challenging situations, planning responses rather than reacting and encouraging problem-solving and reflection in staff. 6. Staff reflected {{on a number of issues}} that affected their ability to apply learning in practice. They commented on the need for a learning culture, with a strategy to support the <b>implementation</b> of <b>new</b> <b>learning.</b> They felt senior managerial support with the implementation of change was crucial. Having the time to implement learning was important and access to ongoing support to implement change would also be helpful, through perhaps knowledge café events or supervision and coaching. 7. The service users found their involvement in this research to be largely positive, though there is a need to ensure all academics are attuned to the needs of service users engaged in projects. 8. A number of recommendations emerged, such as: continue to include a wide range of staff in the same programme to allow sharing of expertise; consider delivering to an even wider range of staff including team leaders; maintain external consultancy role in delivery; consider post-course follow-up and include this in the initial contracting. There was also a recommendation that the organisation undertake internal reflections that explore the current learning culture and identify ways of supporting staff to implement learning in practice. 9. The UWE guidelines for PPI in research were evaluated as being fit for purpose and could usefully guide service user and carer involvement in a range of evaluation and research projects...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} <b>new</b> <b>learning</b> {{algorithm}} to enhance fault tolerance of multi-layer neural networks (MLN). This method {{is based on}} the idea that strong weights make MLN sensitive to faults. The purpose of <b>new</b> <b>learning</b> algorithm is to remove obstructions of fault tolerance from MLNs. We discuss about obstructions (strong connection and bias of each unit). As a result, we proposed <b>new</b> <b>learning</b> algorithm which is restricting the absolute value of weight and constructing MLNs without bias. We apply this algorithm to pattern recognition problems. It is shown that the fault tolerance of MLNs is improved...|$|R
