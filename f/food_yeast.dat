Research on Single Cell Protein Technology started {{a century ago}} when Max Delbrück and his colleagues found out the high value of surplus brewer’s yeast as a feeding supplement for animals. During World War I and World War II, yeast-SCP was employed {{on a large scale}} in Germany to counteract food shortages during the war. Inventions for SCP production often represented milestones for biotechnology in general: for example, in 1919, Sak in Denmark and Hayduck in Germany invented a method named, “Zulaufverfahren”, (fed-batch) in which sugar solution was fed continuously to an aerated suspension of yeast instead of adding yeast to diluted sugar solution once (batch). In post war period, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) emphasized on hunger and malnutrition problems of the world in 1960 and introduced the concept of protein gap, showing that 25% of the world population had a deficiency of protein intake in their diet. It was also feared that agricultural production would fail to meet the increasing demands of food by humanity.

This ability determines the success of fermentation on high osmolarity food matrices and leads to spoilage of high sugar and high salt foods. The knowledge about the genes, the metabolic pathways, and the regulatory circuits shaping the Z. rouxii sugar and salt-tolerance, is a prerequisite to develop effective strategies for fermentation control, optimization of food starter culture, and prevention of food spoilage. This review summarizes recent insights on the mechanisms used by Z. rouxii and other osmo and halotolerant food yeasts to endure salts and sugars stresses. Using the information gathered from S. cerevisiae as guide, we highlight how these non-conventional yeasts integrate general and osmoticum-specific adaptive responses under sugar and salts stresses, including regulation of Na(+) and K(+) -fluxes across the plasma membrane, modulation of cell wall properties, compatible osmolyte production and accumulation, and stress signalling pathways. We suggest how an integrated and system-based knowledge on these mechanisms may impact food and biotechnological industries, by improving the yeast spoilage control in food, enhancing the yeast-based bioprocess yields, and engineering the osmotolerance in other organisms...|$|E

In parallel, a draft genome sequence of C. utilis strain DSM 2361 was determined by massively parallel sequencing. Comparisons of protein and coding sequences established that C. utilis is {{not a member of}} the CUG clade of Candida species. In total, we identified 37 proteins in the culture solution, 17 of which were exclusively present in the stationary phase, whereas three proteins were specific to the exponential growth phase. Identified proteins represented mostly carbohydrate-active enzymes associated with cell wall organization, while no proteolytic enzymes and only a few cytoplasmic proteins were detected. Remarkably, cultivation in xylose-based medium generated a protein pattern that diverged significantly from glucose-grown cells, containing the invertase Inv 1 as the major extracellular protein, particularly in its highly glycosylated S-form (slow-migrating).

Calculations made from figures for cheese and casein production (N. Z. Govt. Statistics, 1967) show that in 1966, approximately 500 million gallons of whey alone, were produced. Of this, a comparatively small amount is utilized by the dairy industry to produce alternative by-products. Condensed or dried whey production involves the costly removal of large volumes of water. This necessarily results in a high price to the consumer, and consequently a low consumer demand.

The addition of glutamate or alanine to the starvation medium stimulated the rate of inactivation. Loss of enzyme activity was irreversible since the reappearance of enzyme activity, following the addition of glucose to carbon-starved cultures, was blocked by cycloheximide. A specific rabbit antibody was prepared against the NADP-GDH from C. utilis and used to quantitate the enzyme during inactivation promoted by carbon starvation. The amount of precipitable antigenic material paralleled the rapid decrease of enzyme activity observed after transition of cells from NH 4 +-glucose to glutamate medium. No additional small-molecular-weight protein was precipitated by the antibody {{as a result of the}} inactivation, suggesting that the enzyme is considerably altered during the primary steps of the inactivation process. Analysis by immunoprecipitation of the reappearance of enzyme activity after enzyme inactivation showed that increase of NADP-GDH activity was almost totally due to de novo synthesis, ruling out the possibility that enzyme activity modulation is achieved by reversible covalent modification. Enzyme degradation was also measured during steady-state growth and other changes in nitrogen and carbon status of the culture media. In all instances so far estimated, the enzyme was found to be very stable and not normally subject to high rates of degradation. Therefore, the possibility that inactivation was caused by a change in the ratio of synthesis to degradation can be excluded...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Under {{selected}} conditions Meredith’s actinomycete produced culture fluids {{toxic to}} many fungi. From these fluids the active principle, called musarin, has been isolated by two methods. Preparations active in concentrations of 1 / 80, 000 - 1 / 100, 000 seemed substantially pure. Musarin is an optically active acid of {{high molecular weight}} having by micro-titrationan equivalent weight of a t least 4000. Analyses of the best preparations are in good agreement with an empirical formula (C 361 &oO 14 N 2), 2. No definite conclusion can be drawn about the exact chemical nature of musarin; a protein-like structure seems to be excluded by the low nitrogen content, which recalls that of many bacterial polysaccharides; but formulation as a polysaccharide seems equally unsatisfactory because of the low oxygen content. Tests indicate that musarin {{is one of the}} most potent antifungal antibiotics, though as an antibacterial agent i t is less effective.

By immunizing mice with MOG 35 - 55 peptide experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in a mouse model. Feeding of mice with C. utilis that expresses MOG 35 - 55 peptide on its surface was started seven days prior to immunization and was continued for ten days. Control animals were treated with wild-type fungus or left untreated. Untreated mice developed first clinical symptoms ten days post immunization (p. i.) with an ascending paralysis reaching maximal clinical disability at day 18 to 20 p. i [...] Treatment with the wild-type strain demonstrated comparable clinical symptoms. In contrast, oral gavage of MOG 35 - 55 -presenting fungus ameliorated the development of EAE. In addition, incidence as well as maximal clinical disease severity were significantly reduced. Interestingly, reduction of disease severity also occurred in animals treated with heat-inactivated C. utilis cells indicating that tolerance induction was independent of fungal viability. Better disease outcome correlated with reduced demyelination and cellular inflammation in the spinal cord, lower T cell proliferation against rechallenge with MOG 35 - 55 and more regulatory T cells in the lymph nodes. Our data demonstrate successful that using the food approved fungus C. utilis presenting the immunogenic MOG 35 - 55 peptide on its surface induced an oral tolerance against this epitope in EAE.

Here, we investigated the biological transfer and trophic toxicity of Cd and the effects of dietary Cd exposure on N- 15 fractionation in animal tissues and N transfer from food in a soil collembolan (Folsomia candida) predatory mite (Hypoaspis aculeifer) food chain using experiments conducted in plate and soil systems. Synchronized F. candida were fed yeast or wheat spiked with 0 (Control), 50 (Cd 50), 100 (Cd 100) or 200 (Cd 200) mu g Cd g(- 1) food for two weeks and were then offered to synchronized H. aculeifer as prey for two weeks. Cadmium concentrations in tissues of both the collembolan and its predator increased as the Cd concentrations in the <b>food</b> <b>yeast</b> or wheat increased in both the plate and soil systems, and the Cd concentrations in the food and the animals were all significantly and positively correlated. Except for the controls, the Cd bioaccumulation factor (BAF) between adults of predatory mites and consumer collembolans (0. 20 - 1. 13) was 2. 5 - 14 times higher than that from food yeast/wheat to consumer collembolans (0. 02 - 0. 08). Cadmium transfer has not altered the reproduction of the filial generation collembolans but the reproduction of the predatory mite declined by 34. 3 % with the Cd concentration in its juveniles reaching 5. 94 mu g g(- 1), suggesting that Cd transfer from the spiked food can present a higher toxicity to the predator H. aculeifer. Food spiked with Cd decreased the N content in the collembolan tissues assimilated from the food and enriched the N- 15 fraction (delta N- 15) in their tissues by affecting their metabolic turnover and growth rates. The Cd trophic transfer between collembolans and predatory mites from spiked food can directly increase the delta N- 15 value of predatory mites and restrict the movement of N from collembolans to predatory mites. The delta N- 15 of soil animals has considerable potential as a biomarker of Cd stress, N- 15 isotope application may be limited in Cd polluted soil ecosystems, and the N transfer function of soil food webs may be more vulnerable in polluted ecosystems.

Main risk factors include nutritional deficiency of iron, mainly due to poor absorption of iron from diets high in phytate, an anti-nutrient present in cereal-based diets; and consumption of a folate-deficient diet. Phytases, enzymes that degrade phytate, may be used in the preparation of such diets in order to improve the bioavailability of iron, and microorganisms present in fermented foods may produce folate. The work described in this thesis combines biotechnology with traditional processing methods in order to degrade phytate and increase folate content in African cereal-based <b>foods.</b> <b>Yeast</b> strains were isolated and identified from Tanzanian togwa, a natural fermented cereal-based <b>food.</b> The <b>yeast</b> strains were tested for phytase activity in yeast medium and further tested in a model togwa. In addition, selected yeast strains were screened for folate production. One yeast strain was finally selected for closer studies of production and secretion of phytase. Yeasts isolated from Tanzanian togwa were identified as Pichia burtonii, Issatchenkia orientalis/Candida krusei, Pichia anomala, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia guilliermondii, Hanseniaspora guilliermondii, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Candida glabrata and Pichia norvegensis. Strains of I. orientalis/C. krusei and H. guilliermondii exhibited extensive phytate degradation in a liquid phytase activity screening. The three strains with highest capacity to degrade phytate were investigated in a model togwa and fermentation with C. krusei TY 13 or H. guilliermondii TY 14 yielded a phytate reduction of 95 % or more. Yeast fermentation increased the folate content in model togwa by 85 - 97 %. Finally, the C. krusei TY 13 strain was discovered to secrete phytase to the culture medium during growth. In conclusion, the results show that phytate present in model togwa can be substantially degraded by phytase-producing yeasts and that the folate content increased depending on the yeast strain used. Such yeast varieties have a potential to improve the mineral bioavailability and increase the folate content of fermented cereal-based foods prepared for use in developing countries...|$|R
