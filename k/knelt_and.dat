25|$|Elizabeth Woodville {{engaged in}} acts of Christian piety in keeping with {{conventional}} expectations of a medieval queen consort. Her acts included making pilgrimages, obtaining a papal indulgence for those who <b>knelt</b> <b>and</b> said the Angelus three times per day, and founding the chapel of St. Erasmus in Westminster Abbey.|$|E
25|$|The victim dug his own grave, {{scooping}} {{the dirt}} {{out with his}} hands... He crossed himself. Then a contra executioner <b>knelt</b> <b>and</b> rammed a k-bar knife into his throat. A second enforcer stabbed at his jugular, then his abdomen. When the corpse was finally still, the contras threw dirt over the shallow grave — and walked away.|$|E
25|$|While Polish {{commentators}} saw Putin's {{participation in}} the ceremony held on April 7 as a symbolic gesture, they were touched when Putin and Tusk paid tribute and laid flowers {{at the site of}} the crash. Tusk <b>knelt</b> <b>and</b> briefly hid his face in his hands, then stood up as Putin patted him on the shoulder. The two hugged, then gave a joint press conference on the investigation into the crash. Polish commentators noted this was a human gesture, and a display of emotion that Poles had longed to see from their eastern neighbours.|$|E

25|$|Beginning {{at the end}} of January, he {{performed}} with his Wonder Horses for several weeks on the Keith-Albee-Orpheum Circuit at the New York Hippodrome. His 15-minute presentation was far above the average horse act, but did not begin to compare with John Aggee's equines that had appeared previously in the same setting at the Hippodrome. The two acts were different. Joyce's presentation was the typical circus offering of the kind where the animals followed set routines. It opened with a high school turn with various types of 1 and 2 steps to music with Joyce in the saddle. Then Jack dismounted and put his black steed through a ritual where it <b>knelt</b> <b>and</b> ran between 2 cannons in the ring. Carrying flags it jumped over the cannons and fired them. Later in the engagement, Joyce, {{for the sake of a}} smoother presentation, replaced this part of the act with a riding turn. Next, the drollery of an English comic brought forth mild laughter. Cossack trick riding with various unique feats scored well as the horse and rider raced around the ring. Following came 6 showy equines with royal plumes and glittering harness. They did a nice drill which ended with their marching on the rim of the ring curb. The horses were somewhat hesitant in their movements and notably nervous, probably as a result of experiencing the very rough ocean crossing just two weeks earlier.|$|E
500|$|On 20 April 1992, Bowie {{appeared}} at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, following the Queen singer's death the previous year. As well as performing [...] "Heroes" [...] and [...] "All the Young Dudes", {{he was joined}} on [...] "Under Pressure" [...] by Annie Lennox, who took Mercury's vocal part; during his appearance, Bowie <b>knelt</b> <b>and</b> recited the Lord's Prayer at Wembley Stadium. Four days later, Bowie and Iman were married in Switzerland. Intending to move to Los Angeles, they flew in {{to search for a}} suitable property, but found themselves confined to their hotel, under curfew: the 1992 Los Angeles riots began the day they arrived. They settled in New York instead.|$|E
500|$|By May 6, the jails were so full that Connor {{transformed}} the stockade {{at the state}} fairgrounds into a makeshift jail to hold protesters. Blacks arrived at white churches to integrate services. They were accepted in Roman Catholic, Episcopal, and Presbyterian churches but turned away at others, where they <b>knelt</b> <b>and</b> prayed until they were arrested. Well-known national figures arrived to show support. Singer Joan Baez arrived to perform for free at Miles College and stayed at the black-owned and integrated Gaston Motel. Comedian Dick Gregory and Barbara Deming, a writer for The Nation, were both arrested. The young Dan Rather reported for CBS News. The car of Fannie Flagg, a local television personality and recent Miss Alabama finalist, was surrounded by teenagers who recognized her. Flagg worked at Channel 6 on the morning show, and after asking her producers why the show was not covering the demonstrations, she received orders never to mention them on air. She {{rolled down the window}} and shouted to the children, [...] "I'm with you all the way!" ...|$|E

500|$|Edgardo {{returned}} to the Catechumens on 22 October, and was visited by his parents often over the next month. As with Momolo's first round of visits, two different versions emerged of what happened. According to Edgardo's parents, the boy was obviously intimidated by the clergymen around him and threw himself into his mother's arms {{when he first saw}} her. Marianna later said: [...] "He had lost weight and had turned pale; his eyes were filled with terror... I told him that he was born a Jew like us and like us he must always remain one, and he replied: Si, mia cara mamma, I will never forget to say the Shema every day.'" [...] One report in the Jewish press described the priests telling Edgardo's parents that God had chosen their son to be [...] "the apostle of Christianity to his family, dedicated to converting his parents and his siblings", and that they could have him back if they also became Christians. The clerics and nuns then <b>knelt</b> <b>and</b> prayed for the conversion of the Mortara household, prompting Edgardo's parents to leave in terror.|$|E
500|$|Hardy came belowdecks to see Nelson {{just after}} half-past two, and {{informed}} him {{that a number of}} enemy ships had surrendered. Nelson told him that he was sure to die, and begged him to pass his possessions to Emma. With Nelson at this point were the chaplain Alexander Scott, the purser Walter Burke, Nelson's steward, Chevalier, and Beatty. Nelson, fearing that a gale was blowing up, instructed Hardy to be sure to anchor. After reminding him to [...] "take care of poor Lady Hamilton", Nelson said [...] "Kiss me, Hardy". Beatty recorded that Hardy <b>knelt</b> <b>and</b> kissed Nelson on the cheek. He then stood {{for a minute or two}} before kissing him on the forehead. Nelson asked, [...] "Who is that?", and on hearing that it was Hardy, he replied [...] "God bless you, Hardy." [...] By now very weak, Nelson continued to murmur instructions to Burke and Scott, [...] "fan, fan... rub, rub... drink, drink." [...] Beatty heard Nelson murmur, [...] "Thank God I have done my duty", and when he returned, Nelson's voice had faded and his pulse was very weak. He looked up as Beatty took his pulse, then closed his eyes. Scott, who remained by Nelson as he died, recorded his last words as [...] "God and my country". Nelson died at half-past four, three hours after he had been shot.|$|E
500|$|The {{derivation}} of the Latin narcissus (...) is unknown. It {{may be a}} loanword {{from another}} language, for instance {{it is said to}} be related to the Sanskrit word nark, meaning 'hell'. It is frequently linked to the Greek myth of Narcissus described by Ovid in his Metamorphoses, who became so obsessed with his own reflection that as he <b>knelt</b> <b>and</b> gazed into a pool of water, he fell into the water and drowned. In some variations, he died of starvation and thirst. In both versions, the narcissus plant sprang from where he died. Although Ovid appeared to describe the plant we now know as Narcissus there is no evidence for this popular derivation, and the person's name may have come from the flower's name. The Poet's Narcissus (N. poeticus), which grows in Greece, has a fragrance that has been described as intoxicating. Again, this explanation lacks any real proof and is largely discredited. Pliny wrote that the plant ‘narce narcissum dictum, non a fabuloso puero’ (named narcissus from narce, not from the legendary youth), i.e. that it was named for its narcotic properties ( [...] narkao, [...] "I grow numb" [...] in Greek), not from the legend. Furthermore, there were accounts of narcissi growing, such as in the legend of Persephone, long before the story of Narcissus appeared (see Greek culture). It has also been suggested that daffodils bending over streams evoked the image of the youth admiring his own reflection in the water.|$|E

2500|$|... "As we {{drew near}} the prison gate, the vicar let down his cassock {{so that he}} might enter as a Priest. At the gate he shook hands with us all, Dr. Nicholson saying, [...] "Let us give him the blessing before he enters", and there, upon the damp stones, the {{prisoner}} <b>knelt,</b> <b>and</b> the white-haired doctor, with uplifted hand, pronounced the most solemn benediction I think I ever heard.|$|E
2500|$|In October of {{that same}} year Barberi visited Littlemore where Newman made his {{confession}} to him Newman relates in his [...] "Apologia" [...] of how Barberi arrived soaked from the rain and as he was drying himself by the fire Newman <b>knelt</b> <b>and</b> asked to be received into the Catholic Church. This event {{is marked by a}} sculpture in the Catholic Church of Blessed Dominic Barberi at Littlemore. Two of Newman's companions at Littlemore were also received and Barberi celebrated Mass for them the following morning. Newman and Barberi always afterward followed each other's careers.|$|E
2500|$|She wrote: [...] "Every {{detail of}} my mother's illness {{is still with}} me, {{specially}} her last weeks on earth." [...] She remembered the bedroom scene where her dying mother received the last sacraments while Thérèse <b>knelt</b> <b>and</b> her father cried. She wrote: [...] "When Mummy died, my happy disposition changed. I had been so lively and open; now I became diffident and oversensitive, crying if anyone looked at me. [...] I was only happy if no one took notice of me... It {{was only in the}} intimacy of my own family, where everyone was wonderfully kind, that I could be more myself." ...|$|E

2500|$|With the benediction read, Elizabeth {{moved to}} the throne and the Archbishop of Canterbury and all the Bishops offered to her their fealty, after which, while the choir sang, the peers of the United Kingdom—led by the royal peers: the Queen's husband; Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester; and Prince Edward, Duke of Kent—each proceeded, in order of precedence, to pay their {{personal}} homage and allegiance to Elizabeth. When the last baron had completed this task, the assembly shouted [...] "God save Queen Elizabeth. Long live Queen Elizabeth. May the Queen live for ever!" [...] Having removed all her royal regalia, Elizabeth <b>knelt</b> <b>and</b> took the communion, including a general confession and absolution, and, along with the congregation, recited the Lord's Prayer.|$|E
2500|$|While on the {{practice}} field, the guardsmen generally faced the parking lot which was about [...] away. At one point, some of them <b>knelt</b> <b>and</b> aimed their weapons toward the parking lot, then stood up again. At one point the guardsmen formed a loose huddle {{and appeared to be}} talking to one another. They had cleared the protesters from the Commons area, and many students had left, but some stayed and were still angrily confronting the soldiers, some throwing rocks and tear gas canisters. About 10 minutes later, the guardsmen began to retrace their steps back up the hill toward the Commons area. Some of the students on the Taylor Hall veranda began to move slowly toward the soldiers as they passed {{over the top of the}} hill and headed back into the Commons.|$|E
2500|$|She did notice, {{however, the}} 'social {{ambition}} and vanity', adding [...] "Céline and I found ourselves mixing {{with members of}} the aristocracy; but we were not impressed..the words of the Imitation, 'do not be solicitous for the shadow of a great name', were not lost on me, and I realised that real nobility is in the soul, not in a name." [...] On 20 November 1887, during a general audience with Leo XIII, Thérèse, in her turn, approached the Pope, <b>knelt,</b> <b>and</b> asked him to allow her to enter Carmel at 15. The Pope said: [...] "Well, my child, do what the superiors decide.... You will enter if it is God's Will" [...] and he blessed Thérèse. [...] She refused to leave his feet, and the Swiss Guard had to carry her out of the room.|$|E

2500|$|Agnes <b>knelt</b> <b>and,</b> crying, begged President Juárez {{to forgive}} the Emperor. The President's answer has become famous in Mexican history textbooks: [...] "It causes me great pain, Madame, {{to see you}} like that on your knees; but even if every king and queen were in your place, I couldn't spare his life. It isn't me who takes it from him, it is {{the people and the}} law who claim his life". Juárez had already {{received}} telegraphs from most of the heads of the European states asking him to spare Maximilan. Upon Juárez's denial the brave woman answered, [...] "Oh, if blood must be spilled, then take my life, the life of a useless woman; and spare that of a man who can still do much good in other country." [...] Juarez did offer to spare the life of her husband, however, Maximilan would undergo a courts martial. [...] The scene was painted by the Mexican painter Manuel Ocaranza. vol.23 no.78 México mar./may. 2001.|$|E
2500|$|Pro and his {{brothers}} were visited by Generals Roberto Cruz and Palomera Lopez around 11 p.m. on November 22, 1927. [...] The next day, as Pro walked from his cell to the courtyard and the firing squad, he blessed the soldiers, <b>knelt,</b> <b>and</b> briefly prayed quietly. Declining a blindfold, he faced his executioners with a crucifix {{in one hand and}} a rosary in the other and held his arms out in imitation of the crucified Christ and shouted out, [...] "May God have mercy on you! May God bless you! Lord, Thou knowest that I am innocent! With all my heart I forgive my enemies!" [...] Before the firing squad were ordered to shoot, Pro raised his arms in imitation of Christ and shouted the defiant cry of the Cristeros, [...] "Viva Cristo Rey!" [...] – [...] "Long live Christ the King!". When the initial shots of the firing squad failed to kill him, a soldier shot him at point-blank range.|$|E
2500|$|On November 25, 1970, Mishima {{and four}} members of the Tatenokai, under pretext, visited the commandant of the Ichigaya Camp, the Tokyo {{headquarters}} of the Eastern Command of the Japan Self-Defense Forces. Inside, they barricaded the office and tied the commandant to his chair. With a prepared manifesto and a banner listing their demands, Mishima stepped onto the balcony to address the soldiers gathered below. His speech was intended to inspire a coup d'état to restore the power of the emperor. He succeeded only in irritating the soldiers, and was mocked and jeered. He finished his planned speech after a few minutes, returned to the commandant's office and committed seppuku. The assisting kaishakunin duty {{at the end of this}} ritual (to decapitate Mishima) had been assigned to Tatenokai member Masakatsu Morita, who was unable to properly perform the task. After several failed attempts at severing Mishima's head, he allowed another Tatenokai member, Hiroyasu Koga, to behead Mishima. Morita then <b>knelt</b> <b>and</b> stabbed himself in the abdomen and Koga again performed the kaishakunin duty. This coup is called [...] in Japan.|$|E
