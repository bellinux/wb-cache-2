50|$|Arnold Pen Co., Seward Trunk Co., Titmus Optical, and Amsted Rail-Brenco {{bearings}} {{operate in}} Petersburg. The {{city has a}} long history as an industrial center for Virginia. It was home to many tobacco companies, including tobacco giant Brown & Williamson. The Southern Chemical Co., the original maker of Fleets Phoso-soda (used in hospitals worldwide), was a well-known brand associated with the town. In the early 1990s the retailer Walmart opened a large distribution center just west of town in neighboring Dinwiddie County. As of September 2012, the e-tailer Amazon.com also opened a <b>fulfilment</b> <b>center</b> in neighboring Dinwiddie County. This brought hundreds of new jobs to the area.|$|E

These picking costs can {{be up to}} 60 % of total warehousing costs. Order picking {{is a process of}} gathering requested stock keeping units one order at a time, while picking operations involve a lot of large and medium-sized companies which belong to many industrial and service sectors. A significant example is now represented by the recent growth of e-commerce companies, which operate in growing global and extended markets. This study shows and measures the impact of alternative policies and configurations of manual picker to part order picking systems, with the aim of designing and optimizing robust facilities, minimizing global costs and maximizing their performances in terms of efficiency and customer service quality. The impact of the most critical and decisive parameters is quantified by a dynamic multi-parametric modeling of warehousing system and by using an integrated approach. Compared to the studies in the literature this approach is innovative. The analysis is based on modeling of thousands of what-if scenarios, which interactively support the management decision-making process. The effectiveness of simulation as a supporting decision tool is justified by the computational complexity of the whole design problem and by a set of innovative and practical results useful to system designer and controller...|$|R
