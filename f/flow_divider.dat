25|$|Carotid IMT {{has been}} {{measured}} in numerous epidemiological and clinical studies. These have shown associations with numerous risk factors, including {{type 2 diabetes}} and impaired glucose tolerance, familial hypercholesterolemia, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides, rheumatoid arthritis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and air pollution. Since the 1990s, some small and larger scale clinical trials of lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions have also used carotid artery IMT as a surrogate endpoint for evaluating the regression and/or progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However the appropriateness of carotid IMT {{in this context is}} uncertain. Although carotid intima-media thickness is strongly associated with atherosclerosis, thickening of the intima-media may not always be due to atherosclerosis. Intima-medial thickening is a complex process, depending on a variety of factors, including local hemodynamics, blood pressure, shear stress and circumferential tensile stress. Changes in shear stress may adversely affect endothelial function and particle residence time, affecting the delivery and transport of potentially atherogenic particles into the arterial wall and consequent plaque formation. Blood pressure may affect IMT through blood vessel remodelling or wall hypertrophy in response to altered circumferential stress. Variations in IMT between different locations, such as the inflow side of branches, the inner curvature at bends and opposite the <b>flow</b> <b>divider</b> at bifurcations may reflect differences in local hemodynamic forces. However, an IMT greater than 0.9-1mm is highly likely to be indicative of atherosclerosis and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Often, the measurement of the IMT is measured in three locations: in the common carotid (typically at one cm proximal to the <b>flow</b> <b>divider),</b> at the bifurcation, and in the internal carotid artery. IMT measurements of the far (deeper) wall, by ultrasound, are generally considered more reliable than measurements performed on the near (more superficial) wall; although measurement of both near and far wall IMT has also been advocated.|$|E

We demonstrate that by means of variation of input guided wave intensities even small nonlinear phase mismatches may switch the bistable system from one equilibrium state to another and back, resulting in deep modulation of beam reflection and transmission coefficients due to the exchange between trapped and free photons.

50|$|Another {{issue to}} consider, once {{the choice to}} examine the carotid artery has been defined, is on which segment of the carotid artery to perform the {{measurement}}.

50|$|In piston {{aircraft}} engines, continuous-flow {{fuel injection}} {{is the most}} common type. In contrast to automotive fuel injection systems, aircraft continuous flow fuel injection is all mechanical, requiring no electricity to operate. Two common types exist: the Bendix RSA system, and the TCM system. The Bendix system is a direct descendant of the pressure carburetor. However, instead of having a discharge valve in the barrel, it uses a <b>flow</b> <b>divider</b> mounted on top of the engine, which controls the discharge rate and evenly distributes the fuel to stainless steel injection lines to the intake ports of each cylinder. The TCM system is even more simple. It has no venturi, no pressure chambers, no diaphragms, and no discharge valve. The control unit is fed by a constant-pressure fuel pump. The control unit simply uses a butterfly valve for the air, which is linked by a mechanical linkage to a rotary valve for the fuel. Inside the control unit is another restriction, which controls the fuel mixture. The pressure drop across the restrictions in the control unit controls the amount of fuel flow, so that fuel flow is directly proportional to the pressure at the <b>flow</b> <b>divider.</b> In fact, most aircraft that use the TCM fuel injection system feature a fuel flow gauge that is actually a pressure gauge calibrated in gallons per hour or pounds per hour of fuel.|$|E

50|$|However, a {{different}} possible explanation has emerged. Alternatively, the vascular occlusion {{could be the}} result of microemboli from the carotid thrombi before the lumen becomes completely blocked. In this scenario, the clotting becomes too severe and the clot breaks free. The resulting traveling clot is known as an embolus (plural emboli). The wall of internal carotid artery just distal to the bifurcation (split) is a common site of atherosclerosis because of the unique hemodynamic effects caused by the blood <b>flow</b> <b>divider.</b> As a result, thrombi formation is more prevalent there. In general, researches have observed that this microembolization is a frequent phenomenon during the build-up of cerebral thrombi. The resulting emboli are pieces of calcified plaque. If these microemboli are 0.1 mm in diameter, they might pass into the small branches of the vascular system. There they may be destroyed by protective cellular defenses, or they may cause a stroke. Altogether, these considerations suggest that the watershed infarcts in carotid thrombosis are caused by microembolization from mural thrombi, thrombi adherent to the vessel wall, rather than by blood flow disturbances.|$|E
50|$|Though carotid intima-media {{thickness}} {{seems to}} be strongly associated with atherosclerosis, {{not all of the}} processes of thickening of the intima-media are due to atherosclerosis. Intimal thickening is in fact a complex process, depending on a variety of factors, not necessarily related to atherosclerosis. Local hemodynamics play an important role, higher blood pressure and changes in shear stress being potential causes of intimal thickening. Changes in shear stress and blood pressure may cause a local delay in lumenal transportation of potentially atherogenic particles, which favors the penetration of particles into the arterial wall and consequent plaque formation. However non-atherosclerotic reactions may also exist, as in intimal hyperplasia and intimal fibrocellular hypertrophy, two different compensatory reactions of the arterial wall to changes in shear stress, which also consist in thickening of the arterial wall. In some cases, more than one of these reactions may be present, and indeed as all of these are associated to particular flow conditions, they are often found in common areas, such as the inflow side of branches, the inner curvature at bends and opposite the <b>flow</b> <b>divider</b> at bifurcations. However, changes in the IMT above thresholds of around 900 μm almost certainly are indicative of an atherosclerotic pathology.|$|E

40|$|Aims: Early {{atherosclerosis}} {{is located}} in low wall shear-stress (WSS) regions, however plaques are {{also found in the}} high WSS sensing <b>flow</b> <b>divider</b> walls of coronary bifurcations. We assessed the plaque distribution and morphology near bifurcations non-invasively with 64 -slice computed tomography in relation to the WSS distribution. Methods and results: We inspected 65 cross-sections near coronary bifurcations for the presence of plaque. Cross-sections were divided into four equal parts, which we numbered according to expected levels of WSS, with part I the lowest WSS (outer wall) and increasing WSS's in part II (inner bend), III (outer bend) and IV (<b>flow</b> <b>divider).</b> Of the cross-sections 88 % had plaque. Of all parts I, 72 % contained plaque. This was 62 %, 38 % and 31 % in parts II, III and IV. In cross-sections with only 1 or 2 parts inflicted, plaque was found in part I and/or II in 94 %. In 93 % of the cross-sections with the <b>flow</b> <b>divider</b> inflicted, parts I and/or II were also inflicted. Plaque was never found exclusively in the <b>flow</b> <b>divider</b> part IV. Conclusions: We demonstrated that plaque is mostly present in low WSS regions, whereas plaque in high WSS regions is accompanied by plaque in adjacent low WSS regions. It is therefore plausible that plaque grows from the outer wall (low WSS) of the bifurcation towards the <b>flow</b> <b>divider</b> (high WSS) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{sought to}} examine, in vivo, the shape and {{position}} of atheroma in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. Background. The prevalence, shape and location of atheromas involving the proximal left anterior descending artery have implications regarding the role of disturbed shear forces in the genesis of atherosclerosis. However, no data are available regarding in vivo findings or advanced disease. Methods. Forty-two consecutive high quality intravascular ultrasound images were examined from patients with atherosclerotic disease in the proximal left anterior descending artery just distal to the left main bifurcation. Lesion percent area stenosis and maximal, minimal and <b>flow</b> <b>divider</b> intimal-medial thickness were measured at the region immediately after the circumflex takeoff. The angle formed by {{the midpoint of the}} <b>flow</b> <b>divider,</b> the lumen center of gravity and the maximal plaque thickness were determined. Results. Eccentricity of vessel wall atheroma was observed such that the maximal wall thickness (1. 42 ± 0. 50 mm [mean ± SD]) differed significantly from minimal wall thickness (0. 17 ± 0. 098 mm). Further, the region of vessel wall manifesting maximal thickness was greater than the <b>flow</b> <b>divider</b> thickness (0. 26 ± 0. 17 mm). Maximal plaque thickness spared the region of the <b>flow</b> <b>divider</b> in 100 % of cases and was positioned at a mean angle of 193 ± 49 ° {{from the center of the}} <b>flow</b> <b>divider.</b> Eccentric morphology was maintained across the 24 % to 80 % range of area stenosis.

Atheromas in the very proximal left anterior descending artery are located opposite the circumflex takeoff, spare the <b>flow</b> <b>divider</b> and maintain eccentricity across a wide range of vessel stenoses.

40|$|ObjectivesUsing human {{pathologic}} specimens {{from the}} CVPath registry, we aimed {{to investigate the}} location of the atherosclerotic plaque at bifurcation in native coronary atherosclerotic lesions and to determine the responses at bifurcation after implantation of bare-metal stents (BMS) and drug-eluting stents (DES). BackgroundGreater atherosclerotic plaque burden has been reported to occur at low-shear regions of bifurcation. MethodsTwenty-six randomly selected human atherosclerotic nonstented coronary bifurcation lesions were examined longitudinally for plaque distribution in patients dying of severe coronary artery disease. Forty stented bifurcation lesions (21 BMS and 19 DES) were reviewed and analyzed by morphometry. ResultsIn nonstented coronary bifurcations, the lateral wall showed significantly greater intima as well as necrotic core thickness than the <b>flow</b> <b>divider.</b> In the stented lesion, the frequency of late stent thrombosis was greater in the DES group (75 %) than in the BMS group (36 %), whereas restenosis was more frequent in the BMS group (33 %) than in the DES group (5 %). Neointimal formation was significantly less at the <b>flow</b> <b>divider</b> compared with the lateral wall in the DES group (0. 07 mm [interquartile range (IQR) 0. 03 to 0. 15 mm] vs. 0. 17 mm [IQR 0. 09 to 0. 23 mm]; p = 0. 001), whereas this difference was not significant in the BMS group. Similarly, uncovered struts and fibrin deposition was significantly greater at the <b>flow</b> <b>divider</b> compared with the lateral wall in the DES group (uncovered: 40 % [IQR 16 % to 76 %] vs. 0 % [IQR 0 % to 15 %]; p = 0. 001; fibrin: 60 % [IQR 21 % to 67 %] vs. 17 % [IQR 0 % to 55 %]; p = 0. 01), but not in the BMS group. ConclusionsPlaque formation in native coronary bifurcations and neointimal growth after DES implantation was significantly less at the <b>flow</b> <b>divider</b> versus the lateral wall. A higher prevalence of late stent thrombosis in DES compared with BMS was associated with greater uncovered struts at <b>flow</b> <b>divider</b> sites, which is likely due to flow disturbances...|$|E

40|$|Background: Treatment of {{arterial}} bifurcation lesions using {{drug-eluting stents}} (DES) is now common clinical practice {{and yet the}} mechanisms governing drug distribution in these complex morphologies are incompletely understood. It is still not evident how to efficiently determine the efficacy of local drug delivery and quantify zones of excessive drug that are harbingers of vascular toxicity and thrombosis, and areas of depletion {{that are associated with}} tissue overgrowth and luminal re-narrowing. Methods and Results: We constructed two-phase computational models of stent-deployed arterial bifurcations simulating blood flow and drug transport to investigate the factors modulating drug distribution when the main-branch (MB) was treated using a DES. Simulations predicted extensive flow-mediated drug delivery in bifurcated vascular beds where the drug distribution patterns are heterogeneous and sensitive to relative stent position and luminal flow. A single DES in the MB coupled with large retrograde luminal flow on the lateral wall of the side-branch (SB) can provide drug deposition on the SB lumen-wall interface, except when the MB stent is downstream of the SB <b>flow</b> <b>divider.</b> In an even more dramatic fashion, the presence of the SB affects drug distribution in the stented MB. Here fluid mechanic effects play an even greater role than in the SB especially when the DES is across and downstream to the <b>flow</b> <b>divider</b> and in a manner dependent upon the Reynolds number.

In this study, the appearance {{and distribution of}} endothelial cell microfilaments in the rabbit thoracic aorta, the abdominal aorta and its major arterial branch points, and the aortic bifurcation were examined. Perfusion fixed rabbit aortas were stained hi situ for F-actin by infusing rhodamine phalloklin via a peristaltic pump into the aortas at a slow flow rate. This new technique resulted in excellent visualization of branch points and allowed for a precise description of the actin microfilament bundles hi endothelial cells along flow dividers. In the thoracic and abdominal aorta, away from branch ostia, actin microfilaments were localized in two regions of the endothelial cells, as a prominent band that completely outlined the cell periphery, and also as short central stress fibers.

40|$|The {{branching}} pattern of epicardial coronary arteries is clearly three-dimensional, with correspondingly complex flow patterns. The {{objective of the}} present study was to perform a detailed hemodynamic analysis using a three-dimensional finite element method in a left anterior descending (LAD) epicardial arterial tree, including main trunk and primary branches, based on computed tomography scans. The inlet LAD flow velocity was measured in an anesthetized pig, and the outlet pressure boundary condition was estimated based on scaling laws. The spatial and temporal wall shear stress (WSS), gradient of WSS (WSSG), and oscillatory shear index (OSI) were calculated and used to identify regions of flow disturbances in the vicinity of primary bifurcations. We found that low WSS and high OSI coincide with disturbed flows (stagnated, secondary, and reversed flows) opposite to the <b>flow</b> <b>divider</b> and lateral to the junction orifice of the main trunk and primary branches.

CASE REPORT: An 83 -year-old woman was admitted to our Institution for volumetric expansion of the aneurysm sac due to a suspected type II endoleak. Post-analysis, using OsiriX, revealed {{the presence of a}} hole at the distal portion of the main body in the docking zone near the <b>flow</b> <b>divider.</b> CONCLUSION: OsiriX is an image processing software and an attractive alternative to dedicated workstations and allows rendering and analysis of numerous medical imaging modalities...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper aims at {{presenting}} numerical {{solutions for}} steady MHD blood flow through a bifurcated artery with mild stenosis in parent lumen with heat transfer assuming blood as couple stress fluid. The arteries design of bifurcation {{is referred to}} be symmetric about the axis of the artery and straight cylinders of limited length. The governing equations are non-dimensionalized and coordinate transformation is used to convert the irregular boundary to a well defined boundary. The resulting system of equations is solved numerically using the finite difference method. The variation of shear stress, flow rate and impedance near the <b>flow</b> <b>divider</b> with relevant physical parameters are presented graphically...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Cardiac {{outflow tract}} {{patterning}} and cell contribution are studied using an evo-devo approach to reveal {{insight into the}} development of aorto-pulmonary septation. Results We studied embryonic stages of reptile hearts (lizard, turtle and crocodile) and compared these to avian and mammalian development. Immunohistochemistry allowed us to indicate where the essential cell components in the outflow tract and aortic sac were deployed, more specifically endocardial, neural crest and second heart field cells. The neural crest-derived aorto-pulmonary septum separates the pulmonary trunk from both aortae in reptiles, presenting with a left visceral and a right systemic aorta arising from the unseptated ventricle. Second heart field-derived cells function as flow dividers between both aortae and between the two pulmonary arteries. In birds, the left visceral aorta disappears early in development, while the right systemic aorta persists. This leads to a fusion of the aorto-pulmonary septum and the aortic <b>flow</b> <b>divider</b> (second heart field population) forming an avian aorto-pulmonary septal complex. In mammals, {{there is also a}} second heart field-derived aortic <b>flow</b> <b>divider,</b> albeit at a more distal site, while the aorto-pulmonary septum separates the aortic trunk from the pulmonary trunk. As in birds there is fusion with second heart field-derived cells albeit from the pulmonary <b>flow</b> <b>divider</b> as the right 6 th pharyngeal arch artery disappears, resulting in a mammalian aorto-pulmonary septal complex. In crocodiles, birds and mammals, the main septal and parietal endocardial cushions receive neural crest cells that are functional in fusion and myocardialization of the outflow tract septum. Longer-lasting septation in crocodiles demonstrates a heterochrony in development. In other reptiles with no indication of incursion of neural crest cells, there is either no myocardialized outflow tract septum (lizard) or it is vestigial (turtle). Crocodiles are unique in bearing a central shunt, the foramen of Panizza, between the roots of both aortae. Finally, the soft-shell turtle investigated here exhibits a spongy histology of the developing carotid arteries supposedly related to regulation of blood flow during pharyngeal excretion in this species. Conclusions This {{is the first time that}} is shown that an interplay of second heart field-derived flow dividers with a neural crest-derived cell population is a variable but common, denominator across all species studied for vascular patterning and outflow tract septation. The observed differences in normal development of reptiles may have impact on the understanding of development of human congenital outflow tract malformations...|$|E

40|$|Experiments {{have been}} carried out to find the maximum dry density taken up by sands during pluviation. These {{experiments}} were facilitated by use of a <b>flow</b> <b>divider</b> that permitted very low depositional intensities. It was found that the maximum dry density occurred at an optimum pluviation time. Careful observation of the pluviating sand reveals that compaction takes place within an “energetic layer” of 3 to 4 grains in thickness and that maximum dry density requires the full and continuous development of this layer. Further experiments were conducted to compare simple pouring without diffuser meshes with pluviation: it is shown that at very slow rates of pour, pouring gives the same density as pluviation. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Cardiovascular {{magnetic}} resonance (CMR) allows volumetric carotid plaque measurement that has advantage over 2 -dimensional ultrasound (US) intima-media thickness (IMT) in evaluating treatment response. We tested {{the hypothesis that}} 6 -month statin treatment in patients with carotid plaque will lead to plaque regression when measured by 3 Tesla CMR but not by IMT. Methods Twenty-six subjects (67 ± 2 years, 7 females) with known carotid plaque (> 1. 1 mm) and coronary or cerebrovascular atherosclerotic disease underwent 3 T CMR (T 1, T 2, proton density and time of flight sequences) and US at baseline and following 6 months of statin therapy (6 had initiation, 7 had increase and 13 had maintenance of statin dosing). CMR plaque volume (PV) was measured in the region 12 mm below and up to 12 mm above carotid <b>flow</b> <b>divider</b> using software. Mean posterior IMT in the same region was measured. Baseline and 6 -month CMR PV and US IMT were compared. Change in lipid rich/necrotic core (LR/NC) and calcification plaque components from CMR were related to change in PV. Results Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased (86 ± 6 to 74 ± 4 mg/dL, p = 0. 046). CMR PV decreased 5. 8 ± 2 % (1036 ± 59 to 976 ± 65 mm 3, p = 0. 018). Mean IMT was unchanged (1. 12 ± 0. 06 vs. 1. 14 ± 0. 06 mm, p = NS). Patients with initiation or increase of statins had - 8. 8 ± 2. 8 % PV change (p = 0. 001) while patients with maintenance of statin dosing had - 2. 7 ± 3 % change in PV (p = NS). There was circumferential heterogeneity in CMR plaque thickness with greatest thickness in the posterior carotid artery, in the region opposite the <b>flow</b> <b>divider.</b> Similarly there was circumferential regional difference in change of plaque thickness with significant plaque regression in the anterior carotid region in region of the <b>flow</b> <b>divider.</b> Change in LR/NC (R = 0. 62, p = 0. 006) and calcification (R = 0. 45, p = 0. 03) correlated with PV change. Conclusions Six month statin therapy in patients with carotid plaque led to reduced plaque volume by 3 T CMR, but ultrasound posterior IMT did not show any change. The heterogeneous spatial distribution of plaque and regional differences in magnitude of plaque regression may explain the difference in findings and support volumetric measurement of plaque. 3 T CMR has potential advantage over ultrasound IMT to assess treatment response in individuals and may allow reduced sample size, duration and cost of clinical trials of plaque regression. </p...|$|E
