Monitoring data, such as temperature, humidity, and noise, is important for operators to manage the facilities in cabinets.

CENet achieves above 93 % reliable data yield and sends fewer beacons compared to periodic beaconing. It does so through a data-aided routing protocol. In addition, based on B-MAC, we propose a scheduling scheme to increase the lifetime of the network by reducing unnecessary message snooping and channel listening, thus it is more energy efficient than B-MAC. The performance of CENet is evaluated by simulations and experiments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Soft wall capping, which {{involves}} placing a cap {{of soil and}} turf (or other vegetation) {{on the top of}} mined walls, is a potentially ow cost, easy to maintain, ecologically sensitive and effec-tive method of conserving mined monuments. An integrated programme of laboratory and field testing has been designed to test the performance of soft capping in comparison with hard capping at a range of sites in England. A sample of mined walls has been soft capped and mon-itored using repeat photography, with more detailed wooden dowel monitoring of wall moisture and electronic monitoring of temperatures and moisture levels at the base of soft caps at some sites. Experiments designed to test the thermal b anketing capability of the soft caps have been run in an <b>environmental</b> <b>cabinet</b> on scaled-down versions of soft and hard caps, and similar set-ups have also been monitored outdoors in Oxford. Short-term data from both field trials and laboratory tests illustrate the success of soft wall capping under a wide range of environmental conditions, but longer-term monitoring is needed to evaluate more fully the conservation benefits of soft capping. Conserving ruined buildings and monuments poses many problems. Ruined walls are vulnerable t...|$|E

A plan for the biological monitoring of the receiving streams was implemented in 1987 and consisted of ecological surveys, toxicity monitoring of effluents and receiving streams, evaluation of bioaccumulation of trace contaminants in biota, and supplemental chemical characterization of effluents. Beginning in fall 1991, the Environmental Sciences Division (ESD) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory added data collection and report preparation to its responsibilities for the PGDP BMP. The BMP has been continued because it has proven to be extremely valuable in (1) identifying those effluents with the potential for adversely affecting instream fauna, (2) assessing the ecological health of receiving streams, and (3) guiding plans for remediation and protecting human health. The BMP for PGDP consists of three major tasks: (1) effluent toxicity monitoring, (2) bioaccumulation studies, and (3) ecological surveys of benthic macroinvertebrate communities and fish. With the exception of the benthic macroinvertebrate community surveys, this report focuses on activities from January to December 1997...|$|R
40|$|Background Despite its {{importance}} as a surficial rock type on Earth and other planets, {{few studies have}} been made of the response of basalt to physical weathering. Heating and cooling, with or without salts and moisture, may have severe impacts on basalt clasts in many extreme environments (Leask & Wilson, 2003). We report here on an integrated programme of simulations investigating physical weathering of basalt under Earth (hot desert) and Mars conditions using a Fison’s <b>Environmental</b> <b>Cabinet</b> and a specially constructed Mars Environment Simulation Chamber. Methods Small blocks (9 x 2. 3 x 2. 5 cm) of basalt were cut, and two groups prepared: (1) thermally pre-stressed and (2) thermally pre-stressed and immersed in saturated Na 2 SO 4 solution. Sample strength was assessed before and after experimental weathering using a Grindosonic, and thin sections were produced for detailed petrological examination. Ambient, block surface and internal temperatures were monitored throughout the experiments. The Earth weathering regime was set up to reflect Negev desert conditions cycling between 296 K and 345 K; whilst the Martian regime cycled from 190 K to 277 K. Cycle length was 8 hrs. in each case. Both weathering regimes also included an element of radiative heating via lamps coming on for part of the heating cycle. The Mars weathering regime was carried out in 100...|$|E
40|$|This {{article will}} be {{available}} as gold open access on publication. Adhesion requirements for photovoltaic modules to ensure reliability are often discussed but not well defined, neither in terms of tests nor actual requirements. This paper presents a new approach for realistic assessment of the adhesion strength, which shows the conventional peel test may not ensure reliability. The test presented reproduces the actual adhesion requirements for fielded modules much more closely than the commonly used peel testing. The test is conducted in-situ during standard damp-heat test at a temperature of 85 °C and 85 % relative humidity, with the modules installed {{at an angle to}} give an appropriate force vector perpendicular to the backsheet. This is achieved by attaching weights {{to the back of the}} tested samples which are mounted with a 45 ° angle on a testing rack in the <b>environmental</b> <b>cabinet.</b> With an appropriate weight holder, this could be done as part of the standard damp-heat cycle during certification and would not involve additional testing time nor significant changes in the commonly used racking. This approach will identify the weakest interface of the multilayer encapsulation system. A number of test-to-fail bespoke samples are tested to set realistic fail criteria. It is shown that the test allows discrimination between different samples and can identify unsuitable production processes...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to study the}} effect of poor curing simulating hot climatic conditions and remedies on the durability of steel in concrete. Three different curing environments were used i. e. (1) Saturated Ca(OH) 2 solution at 20 °C, (2) Saturated Ca(OH) 2 solution at 50 °C and (3) Air at 50 °C at 30 % relative humidity. The third curing condition corresponding to the temperature and relative humidity typical of Middle Eastern Countries. The nature of the hardened cement paste matrix, cured under the above conditions was studied by means of Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry for measuring pore size distribution. The results were represented as total pore volume and initial pore entry diameter. The Scanning Electron Microscope was used to look at morphological changes during hydration, which were compared to the Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry results. X-ray defraction and Differential Thermal Analysis techniques were also employed for looking at any phase transformations. Polymer impregnation was used to reduce the porosity of the hardened cement pastes, {{especially in the case}} of the poorly cured samples. Carbonation rates of unimpregnated and impregnated cements were determined. Chloride diffusion studies were also undertaken to establish the effect of polymer impregnation and blending of the cements. Finally the corrosion behaviour of embedded steel bars was determined by the technique of Linear Polarisation. The steel was embedded in both untreated and polymer impregnated hardened cement pastes placed in either a solution containing NaCl or an <b>environmental</b> <b>cabinet</b> which provided carbonation at 40 °C and 50 % relative humidity...|$|E
40|$|Field pea is {{the most}} {{produced}} and exported pulse crop in Canada, and makes a major contribution to Western Canadian agricultural diversification programs. Canada is now the world largest exporter of pea, lentil and chickpea and is fourth in dry bean. The demand for Canadian pulse products is steadily rising and the export market would continue to rise with the expected increased in production. Field pea exported to countries with tropical climates is at particular risk due to rapid loss of quality. It is therefore important to develop practical strategies for safe storage of feed pea. Knowledge on the moisture adsorption and spoilage characteristics of pea stored in adverse storage conditions {{is important in the}} transportation and storage of this export commodity. This study was initiated to examine the conditions that lead to quality losses in storage and transport of pea. Tropical and subtropical conditions were simulated in airtight chambers. Relative humidities (RH) of 60, 70, 80 and 90 % were created by saturated salt solutions in airtight chambers at temperatures of 10, 20 and 30 °C, while the same range of humidity was provided by dilute sulphuric acid in airtight chambers at 40 °C in <b>environmental</b> <b>cabinets.</b> The four RH levels at each temperature for both whole and feed-grade pea were tested in duplicate. The samples were observed for changes in moisture content (MC), mold appearance and RH in specific time intervals. The amount of produced carbon dioxide (CO 2) was measured in airtight chambers during storage to control the condition existing in sealed airtight chambers. Also, all components of feed-grade pea were exposed to RH of 90 % and temperature of 40 °C in separate airtight chambers to find the effect of each component on mold appearance. Molds were identified after appearance on the samples in order to pinpoint potential toxicity. Both feed and whole sound peas became molded after a short time of storage at high temperatures and high RH, but those stored at 70 % and below did not develop mold after 175 days at 30 and 40 °C (experiment duration) and 216 days at 10 and 20 °C (experiment duration). Molds were identified mostly as species of Aspergillus and Penicillium. The amount of CO 2 in the airtight chambers showed almost no difference from the ambient CO 2 except at high temperature and high RH when samples had gone molded. Moisture adsorption equations were developed based on the moisture adsorption data in dynamic environment. Although the Page model showed to fit the data better, the exponential model was chosen to fit the data because its parameters can be better expressed as a function of temperature and RH of the storage environment. The mold-free days for both feed pea and clean pea were modeled at temperatures of 10, 20, 30 and 40 °C and RH of 80 and 90 %...|$|R

Rubin quickly developed a playable [...] "Last Starfigher" [...] trainer type flight simulator and the game was put out on field tests. The game used a standard SAC-1 system connected to a powerful Motorola 68000 based motion control computer for motion feedback through the motorized <b>environmental</b> flight simulator <b>cabinet.</b> It earned very well on field tests but had some major problems. Patrons complained of dizziness (some even became ill), the motors were prone to burning out and one units safety system failed, tipping the unit over, dumping a patron and almost crushing them. Bally deemed the SAC-2 system too expensive to produce (estimated to be $10k a unit in 1986 dollars, easily five times a typical games price) and a possible liability so the project was canceled.|$|R
40|$|Great {{pressure}} to curb carbon emission and increased need for energy have forced China {{to develop an}} "energy saving and emission reduction" (ESER) plan. ESER has become China's basic national policy, and a guideline for China's energy and environmental issues during the 11 th Five-Years Plan (2006 - 2010). ESER represents a recalibration of China's economic model, moving away from growth-at-all-cost {{in favor of a}} more "balanced and sustainable" output. In 2007, China's GDP grew by 11. 4 %, but emission of COD and SO 2 decreased by 3. 14 % and 4. 66 % respectively compared to 2006, energy consumption for each unit of GDP declined by 3. 27 % also compared to 2006. ESER is also the engine behind reform of China's traditional administrative system which has always favored economic growth over environmental protection. The ESER accountability system sets green efforts as a decisive factor in determining the career prospects of local leaders. Also, China's State Environmental Protection Agency has been upgraded to the Ministry of <b>Environmental</b> Protection, gaining <b>cabinet</b> status for the first time. A greener future relative to the previous three decades can be anticipated with confidence for China provided that the best practices enunciated by ESER are taken to heart by policymakers.

40|$|Hemp-based {{composites}} are eco-friendly {{building materials}} as they improve energy efficiency in buildings and entail low waste production and pollutant emissions during their manufacturing process. Nevertheless, the organic nature of hemp enhances the bio-receptivity of the material, with likely negative consequences for its long-term {{performance in the}} building. The main {{purpose of this study}} was to study the response at macro- and micro-scale of hemp–lime renders subjected to weathering simulations in an <b>environmental</b> <b>cabinet</b> (one year was condensed in twelve days), so as to predict their long-term durability in coastal and inland areas with Mediterranean, Tropical and Semi-arid climates, also in relation with the lime type used. The simulated climatic conditions caused almost unnoticeable mass, volume and colour changes in hemp–lime renders. No efflorescence or physical breakdown was detected in samples subjected to NaCl, because the salt mainly precipitates on the surface of samples and is washed away by the rain. Although there was no visible microbial colonisation, alkaliphilic fungi (mainly Penicillium and Aspergillus) and bacteria (mainly Bacillus and Micrococcus) were isolated in all samples. Microbial growth and diversification were higher under Tropical climate, due to heavier rainfall. The influence of the bacterial activity on the hardening of samples has also been discussed here and related with the formation and stabilisation of vaterite in hemp–lime mixes. This study has demonstrated that hemp–lime renders show good durability towards a wide range of environmental conditions and factors. However, it might be useful to take some specific preventive and maintenance measures to reduce the bio-receptivity of this material, thus ensuring a longer durability on site...|$|E
