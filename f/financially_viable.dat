5|$|Frank Pick, Managing Director of the Underground Group from 1928 and the Chief Executive of the LPTB, {{aimed to}} move the network away from freight {{services}} and concentrate on the electrification and improvement of the core routes in London. He saw the lines beyond Aylesbury via Quainton Road to Brill and Verney Junction as having little future as <b>financially</b> <b>viable</b> passenger routes. On 1 June 1935 the LPTB gave the required six months' notice to the O that it intended to terminate operations on the Brill Tramway.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Cornwall County Council and Plymouth City Council {{discussed}} {{the feasibility of}} building a road bridge. The government was unenthusiastic about the idea, as {{they did not believe}} it was <b>financially</b> <b>viable</b> and there were more urgent projects in post-war Britain. After being rebuked, both councils agreed to self-fund the entire project, which would be paid for in tolls. The scheme received Royal Assent in July 1957. Invitations to tender were sent on 4 March 1959, and a proposal from the northeast England-based Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company was accepted on 9 June.|$|E
5|$|The New Brighton Tower and Recreation Company {{formed a}} {{football}} team, New Brighton Tower F.C., and applied for membership to the Lancashire League. The team {{joined at the}} start of the 1897–98 season and promptly won the league. The club then applied for election to the Football League. Although they were initially rejected, the league later decided to expand Division Two by four clubs and New Brighton Tower were accepted. They carried on playing until 1901 when the company disbanded the team as they did not gain the fan base they were hoping for and so it was no longer considered <b>financially</b> <b>viable.</b>|$|E

50|$|There {{has been}} a degree of {{controversy}} over whether there was any incentive for Peel to promote the airport. The original lease between the SDC and Tinsley Park Ltd included a reversionary clause permitting the acquisition of 80 acre of land for £1 providing, after 10 years of opening, it could be shown that the airport was <b>financially</b> not <b>viable.</b> The development is being marketed at up to £220 per square foot.

5|$|The {{agreement}} of the ARL and Super League was to unify and become one competition, {{to be known as}} the National Rugby League (NRL), was that only twenty teams would compete in the competition in 1998. This meant that three of the twenty-two teams from both competitions was to be demised with the addition of a new Melbourne based team. With the other Newcastle-based team, the Newcastle Knights winning the 1997 premiership, they were admitted into the new competition, however the NRL saw that two Newcastle based teams would not be <b>financially</b> <b>viable.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Northern Ireland's most {{dominant}} club side, Linfield have been regular campaigners in European football. The club first participated in European competition in 1959 against Göteborg in the 1959–60 European Cup. In {{the first round}} of the 1961–62 European Cup, Linfield were drawn to face an East German team, Vorwärts. The away leg was played, which Linfield lost 3–0. However, Vorwärts were denied visas for entry into the UK to play the second leg, and (similarly to Glenavon the previous season) travelling to play the game in a neutral country was not <b>financially</b> <b>viable</b> for Linfield. They were therefore forced to withdraw from the competition.|$|E
5|$|Teller {{was one of}} {{the strongest}} and best-known advocates for {{investigating}} non-military uses of nuclear explosives, which the United States explored under Operation Plowshare. One of the most controversial projects he proposed was a plan to use a multi-megaton hydrogen bomb to dig a deep-water harbor more than a mile long and half a mile wide to use for shipment of resources from coal and oil fields through Point Hope, Alaska. The Atomic Energy Commission accepted Teller's proposal in 1958 and it was designated Project Chariot. While the AEC was scouting out the Alaskan site, and having withdrawn the land from the public domain, Teller publicly advocated the economic benefits of the plan, but was unable to convince local government leaders that the plan was <b>financially</b> <b>viable.</b>|$|E
50|$|Allied to {{this was}} the declining {{standards}} of the housing itself. Since the scheme was built, some effort {{had been made to}} improve some of the housing, such as replacing some flat roofs with pitched roofs more able to resist the weather. However, the housing suffered from problems such as poor insulation and damp. The cheap, quick solution to the housing problems of the 1950s and 1960s proved also to be short-term, and when it was realised that refurbishing the buildings was <b>financially</b> not <b>viable,</b> the decision was taken to regenerate the area more fundamentally.|$|R

5|$|Frank Pick, Managing Director of the Underground Group from 1928 and the Chief Executive of the LPTB, {{aimed to}} move the network away from freight services, and to {{concentrate}} on the electrification and improvement of the core routes in London. In particular, he saw the lines beyond Aylesbury via Quainton Road to Brill and Verney Junction as having little future as <b>financially</b> <b>viable</b> passenger routes. On 30 November 1935 the last train ran on the Brill Tramway between Brill and Quainton Road, and at the stroke of midnight, the rails connecting the Tramway to the main line were ceremonially severed. The former Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway between Quainton Road and Verney Junction was closed to passengers on 6 July 1936, and London Transport services north of Aylesbury were withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|Rare took greater liberties with {{violence}} and gore in Battletoads Arcade since {{the product was}} not destined for home consoles. It was Rare's first game to use the 3D graphics technology later popularized in Donkey Kong Country and Killer Instinct. Although the game playtested well {{and appeared to be}} <b>financially</b> <b>viable,</b> the publisher hesitated to release it. The game proved unsuccessful in the arcades and its in-production Super NES port was canceled. Retrospective reviews were more positive--Retro Gamer even declared it the best of the series. Battletoads Arcade received its console debut when it was emulated in the 2015 Rare Replay, a compilation of games from Rare's history for the Xbox One. Rare Replay reviewers were surprised by the quality of the arcade game and some considered it a highlight of the package. Battletoads Arcade remains the last entry in the Battletoads series.|$|E
5|$|The XJ220 was not {{initially}} {{intended to be}} a production car, but, following the reception of the concept and financial interest from serious buyers, a feasibility study was carried out by teams from TWR and Jaguar. Its conclusion was that such a car would be technically feasible (subject to engineering changes), {{and that it would be}} <b>financially</b> <b>viable.</b> The announcement of a limited production run of 220 to 350 cars came on 20 December 1989. The list price on 1 January 1990 was £290,000 exclusive of value added tax, options and delivery charges, but by 1992 that had increased considerably owing to indexation of contracts. The offer was four times oversubscribed, and deposits of £50,000 exclusive of Value Added Tax (VAT) were taken from around 1400 customers; first deliveries were planned for mid-1992.|$|E
40|$|It {{is often}} argued that {{cooperative}} firms are <b>financially</b> less <b>viable</b> than investor-owned firms. From a fundamental point of view, however, {{this does not}} seem a fair comparison, since the market for firm ownership is usually only available to investor-owned firms in our economy. This paper examines potential roles {{of the market for}} ownership rights to cooperative firms, particularly in capital procurement of the firm. We show that, with a wellfunctioning membership market, consumer cooperatives are not necessarily financially weaker than investor-owned firms. The consumer cooperative can thus be a promising alternative to the investor-owned firm when the latter type of the firm induces some serious market failure in the product market...|$|R

5000|$|By 1980, VHS {{videos were}} {{beginning}} to be marketed alongside the 16mm films and would quickly overtake the other. A new problem soon erupted: teachers copying films to video and impacting the company’s income. On June 25, 1982, New York’s Board of Cooperative Educational Services was prosecuted for doing this not only by EB, but also Time-Life and the Learning Corporation of America. Although the film companies won, historian Geoff Alexander points out that “perhaps the most disturbing element of the case was that, more than 15 years after the halcyon days of post-Sputnik government largesse, BOCES found it <b>financially</b> more <b>viable</b> to defend a costly lawsuit than to simply buy films and tapes from film companies as it once did.” ...|$|R
5|$|Out of {{a belief}} that many women in the sex {{industry}} have been spiritually abused by Christians trying to frighten {{them out of the}} sex industry with warnings of damnation, JC's Girls focuses on telling these women that God loves them. JC's Girls volunteers tell the women about the gospel but do not try to persuade them to leave the sex industry; the organization recognizes that is often not <b>financially</b> <b>viable</b> for women in the sex industry to immediately sacrifice their employment. JC's Girls connects female sex workers with churches the organization believes to be non-judgmental, hoping that the women will experience the love of Christ through these churches and that they will thereby eventually have the support and strength they need to leave the industry. Prior to referring a woman to a church, JC's Girls puts the church through a formal approval process to ensure that the church will not be judgmental. If women express a desire to leave the sex industry, JC's Girls attempts to support them in doing so.|$|E
5|$|Schmittou {{and team}} owners arrived at terms in June 1984 to {{purchase}} the Triple-A Evansville Triplets of the American Association, with plans to move the franchise from Evansville, Indiana, to Nashville for the 1985 season. In order {{to prove to the}} team's Nashville banks, which would back the purchase, that the move was <b>financially</b> <b>viable,</b> Schmittou commissioned a survey to evaluate the potential turnout for a Triple-A team versus a Double-A team. Though the research proved to team owners that the move was a sensible decision, the banks were not impressed. As a result, the team switched banks and went ahead with the purchase and relocation. The Southern League wanted Schmittou to surrender his franchise to the league, but he had plans to relocate the team instead. Schmittou wanted to send Nashville's existing Southern League franchise to Evansville to continue as the Triplets at Double-A. However, a combination of the league's disapproval of the move and the City of Evansville being unwilling to upgrade Bosse Field resulted in a move to Huntsville, Alabama, where the team became the Huntsville Stars. The Triple-A Sounds carried {{on the history of the}} Double-A team that preceded it. The Triplets' legacy was retired, and the Stars were established as an entirely-new franchise.|$|E
25|$|Considering the {{expensive}} modifications necessary (sometimes in {{the billions of}} dollars) to make many of these older nuclear plants adhere to current safety standards, many believe that these older nuclear power plants open may not be <b>financially</b> <b>viable</b> when compared to sustainable energy alternatives, such as wind and solar energy.|$|E
40|$|Combined Heat and Power (CHP) is the {{production}} of electricity and the simultaneous utilization of the heat produced by the generator prime mover. The energy efficiency advantages of CHP are undisputed, and yet, the continuously changing economic conditions make the implementation of such projects <b>financially</b> not <b>viable</b> if no incentives are available. This thesis attempts to demonstrate the economic benefits associated with DG-CHP. The identification and quantification of both benefits and costs to the different system stakeholders will serve to illustrate that additional DG-CHP installed capacity results in positive system wide benefits. Furthermore, it will be shown that there is justification to re-evaluate a more balanced allocation - among the different system stakeholders - of the benefits resulting from the implementation of DG-CHP technology in the New York State region...|$|R
50|$|East London {{was served}} by the East London Technical and Commercial High School, a dual medium school, {{established}} in 1968, {{that grew out of}} and operated as a day school in the buildings of the then East London Technical College, now the East London FET College, that itself was established in 1927. The College itself largely taught post school candidates after working hours. The Technical and Commercial High School offered courses in a technical or commercial direction in Standards Eight to Ten - now Grades Ten to Twelve. Admission was a pass in Standard Seven, now grade nine.National education policy in the 1960s determined that each educational region should have a technical high school and a commercial high school as specialist schools. Plans were thus put in place to build a commercial high school for East London, and the old race course site, that had lain fallow for many years after horse racing had discontinued, because it was <b>financially</b> not <b>viable,</b> was acquired.|$|R
40|$|Finance Institution (DFI), {{completed}} 50 {{years of}} successful operations in 2006. Many similar institutions established {{in other parts}} of the world, most notably following World War II, have ceased to exist because they have become <b>financially</b> not <b>viable.</b> The DFCC is one among a small number of DFIs that not only has continued to remain viable, but also has been successful in transforming itself into a multi-product and robust financial institution in a changing international and local environment. Why and how did the DFCC succeed when other similar institutions failed? What did it do that others did not, and what did it do differently? What was unique in its structure or governance framework that may have enabled it to withstand more effectively the varied political and other pressures it may have been subjected to as a development-oriented institution that worked closely with the government? This study attempts to answer those questions, with a view toward learning from this experience. S...|$|R

25|$|The {{railway system}} in this period {{underwent}} modernisation, reorganisation and rebranding, some of which proved controversial. The use of steam locomotives on the network also ended in this period.

40|$|Labour marker {{controls}} in sport {{have been around}} since the very beginning of professional leagues, with the stated intention of helping to create a more even, and therefore <b>financially</b> more <b>viable</b> competition. Soccer's transfer system {{is one of the best}} known of these market controls, and Jean-Marc Bosman's successful 1996 challenge to the system in the European Court of Justice must rank as a landmark sports law case. However, while this ruling abolished the transfer system for players whose contracts had concluded, a compromise reached in 2001 between the relevant governing bodies of soccer, FIFA and UEFA, and the European Commission, maintained the system for players still under contract. The result was a set of regulations called Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players (Status Regulations) which set out the requirements for these transfers. This article will therefore provide a review of soccer's the transfer system post-Bosman, and the effectiveness of the Status Regulations in the seven years that they have been in operation...|$|R
