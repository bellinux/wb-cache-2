General diffuse interstellar medium <b>dust,</b> <b>dust</b> grains in dense clouds, planetary rings <b>dust,</b> and circumstellar <b>dust,</b> are each different in their characteristics. For example, grains in dense clouds have acquired a mantle of ice and on average are larger than <b>dust</b> particles in the diffuse interstellar medium.

His work as a cataloguer also taught him to describe objects in a concise manner and required him to research these objects.

5|$|Pollen {{is removed}} from flowers {{deliberately}} or incidentally by bumblebees. Incidental removal occurs when bumblebees {{come in contact with}} the anthers of a flower while collecting nectar. When it enters a flower, the bumblebee's body hairs receive a <b>dusting</b> of pollen from the anthers. In queens and workers this is then groomed into the corbiculae (pollen baskets) on the hind legs where it can be seen as bulging masses that may contain as many as a million pollen grains. Male bumblebees do not have corbiculae and do not purposively collect pollen. Bumblebees are also capable of buzz pollination, in which they dislodge pollen from the anthers by creating a resonant vibration with their flight muscles.|$|E

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of the soil <b>dust</b> aerosol cycle to radiative forcing by the soil <b>dust</b> aerosol particles themselves is studied. Four experiments with the NASA GISS atmospheric general circulation model, which includes a soil <b>dust</b> aerosol model, are compared, all using a prescribed climatological sea surface temperature as a lower boundary condition. In one experiment, <b>dust</b> is included as a dynamic tracer with no radiative effect, whereas <b>dust</b> interacts with radiation in the other simulations. The single-scattering albedo of <b>dust</b> particles is prescribed to be globally uniform in the experiments with radiatively active <b>dust,</b> although this albedo is varied from experiment to experiment. On a global scale the radiative forcing by <b>dust</b> generally causes {{a reduction in the}} atmospheric <b>dust</b> load, corresponding to a decreased <b>dust</b> source flux. The <b>dust</b> source flux and its changes are analyzed in more detail for the main source regions. This analysis shows that the reduction varies both with the season and with the single-scattering albedo of the <b>dust</b> particles. The experiments show that <b>dust</b> radiative forcing can lead to significant changes both in the soil <b>dust</b> cycle and in the climate state. To estimate <b>dust</b> concentration and radiative forcing by <b>dust</b> more accurately, <b>dust</b> size distributions and <b>dust</b> single-scattering albedo in the model should be a function of the source region, because <b>dust</b> concentration and the climate response to <b>dust</b> radiative forcing are sensitive to <b>dust</b> radiative parameters.

5|$|The Washington Capitals then signed Brashear on July 14, 2006, to a one-year, $1 million contract. The signing was {{to provide}} Alexander Ovechkin with some on-ice protection. Capitals {{management}} felt that Brashear was skilled enough {{not to be a}} liability on the team while bringing an intimidating presence. During the 2006–07 season, the Capitals decided to extend Brashear's contract, signing him to a one-year, $1.1 million contract extension. He was suspended one game by the NHL during the regular season for punching New York Rangers defenceman Aaron Ward following a fight between Brashear and Brendan Shanahan. In the game, Shanahan felt Brashear was taking liberties with Rangers captain Jaromír Jágr, and subsequently challenged Brashear to a fight. Brashear won the fight and motioned as if he was <b>dusting</b> off his hands. Ward then approached him and had words with Brashear, who responded by punching him in the face, earning Brashear a game misconduct for intent to injure and eventually the suspension. At season's end, his point total increased from the previous season to 13 and his 156 PIMs ranked him in the top ten (sixth) in the League for the sixth time in his career. In the 2007–08 season, Brashear played in 80 games for the Capitals, but his offensive production slipped down to eight points while registering only 119 PIMs. However, he served as one of the Capitals' alternate captains. On January 24, 2008, the Capitals once again re-signed Brashear, this time to a one-year, $1.2 million extension.|$|E

40|$|The <b>dust</b> {{cycle is}} {{critically}} important for Mars' current climate system. Suspended atmospheric <b>dust</b> affects the radiative balance of the atmosphere, and thus greatly influences the thermal and dynamical state of the atmosphere. Evidence {{for the presence of}} <b>dust</b> in the Martian atmosphere {{can be traced back to}} yellow clouds telescopically observed as early as the early 19 th century. The Mariner 9 orbiter arrived at Mars in November of 1971 to find a planet completely enshrouded in airborne <b>dust.</b> Since that time, the exchange of <b>dust</b> between the planet's surface and atmosphere and the role of airborne <b>dust</b> on Mars' weather and climate has been studied using observations and numerical models. The goal of this talk is to give an overview of the observations and to discuss the successes and challenges associated with modeling the <b>dust</b> cycle. <b>Dust</b> raising events on Mars range in size from meters to hundreds of kilometers. During some years, regional storms merge to produce hemispheric or planet encircling <b>dust</b> clouds that obscure the surface and raise atmospheric temperatures by tens of kelvin. The interannual variability of planet encircling <b>dust</b> storms is poorly understood. Although the occurrence and season of large regional and global <b>dust</b> storms are highly variable from one year to the next, there are many features of the <b>dust</b> cycle that occur year after year. A low-level <b>dust</b> haze is maintained during northern spring and summer, while elevated levels of atmospheric <b>dust</b> occur during northern autumn and winter. During years without global-scale <b>dust</b> storms, two peaks in total <b>dust</b> loading are generally observed: one peak occurs before northern winter solstice and one peak occurs after northern winter solstice. Numerical modeling studies attempting to interactively simulate the Martian <b>dust</b> cycle with general circulation models (GCMs) include the lifting, transport, and sedimentation of radiatively active <b>dust.</b> Two <b>dust</b> lifting processes are commonly represented in these models: wind-stress lifting (i. e., saltation) and <b>dust</b> devil lifting. Although the predicted patterns of <b>dust</b> lifting and atmospheric <b>dust</b> loading from these simulations capture some aspects of the observed <b>dust</b> cycle, there are many notable differences between the simulated and observed <b>dust</b> cycles. For example, it is common for models to predict one peak in global <b>dust</b> loading near northern winter solstice due to excessive <b>dust</b> lifting in the Hellas basin at this season. Additionally, it is difficult for models to realistically capture the observed interannual variability in global <b>dust</b> storms. New avenues of <b>dust</b> cycle modeling research include exploring the effects of finite surface <b>dust</b> reservoirs and the effects of coupling the <b>dust</b> and water cycles on the predicted <b>dust</b> cycle...|$|R
