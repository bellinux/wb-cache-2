50|$|<b>Hard</b> <b>breaking</b> balls: The most {{prominent}} of the <b>hard</b> <b>breaking</b> balls is the slider. A slider is a pitch that breaks {{sharply in the}} direction of the pitcher's arm travel (left to right for a left-handed pitcher). It travels slower than a fastball (usually in the upper 70s to mid 80s) but faster than the slower breaking balls. The other two <b>hard</b> <b>breaking</b> balls are variants of the fastball, the sinker and the split-finger fastball (splitter). Both of these pitches break downwards from the point of release, with the sinker generally tailing slightly to the pitcher's arm travel and the splitter tailing a little bit less. Both pitches are usually thrown in the low to upper 80s, although some travel upwards of 90 mph. The major difference is in their grip and the timing of their break. Like the cut fastball to the 2-seamer, the splitter tends to break much later in its flight path than the sinker does.|$|R

40|$|To {{assess how}} montane meadow {{vegetation}} recovered after a wildfire {{that occurred in}} Yosemite National Park, CA in 1996, Google Earth Engine image processing was applied to leverage the entire Landsat Thematic Mapper archive from 1985 to 2012. Vegetation greenness (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)) was summarized every 16 days across the 28 -year Landsat time series for 26 meadows. Disturbance event detection was hindered by the subtle influence of low-severity fire on meadow vegetation. A <b>hard</b> <b>break</b> (August 1996) was identified corresponding to the Ackerson Fire, and monthly composites were used to compare NDVI values and NDVI trends within burned and unburned meadows before, immediately after, and continuously {{for more than a}} decade following the fire date. Results indicate that NDVI values were significantly lower at 95 % confidence level for burned meadows following the fire date, yet not significantly lower at 95 % confidence level in the unburned meadows. Burned meadows continued to exhibit lower monthly NDVI in the dormant season through 2012. Over the entire monitoring period, the negative-trending, dormant season NDVI slopes in the burned meadows were also significantly lower than unburned meadows at 90 % confidence level. Lower than average NDVI values and slopes in the dormant season compared to unburned meadows, coupled with photographic evidence, strongly suggest that evergreen vegetation was removed from the periphery of some meadows after the fire. These analyses provide insight into how satellite imagery can be used to monitor low-severity fire effects on meadow vegetation...|$|E
40|$|Legacy network {{systems and}} {{protocols}} are mostly static and keep state information in silo-style storage, thus making state migration, transformation and re-use difficult. Software-Defined Network (SDN) approaches in unison with Network Function Virtualization (NFV) allow for more flexibility, {{yet they are}} currently restricted to a limited set of state migration options. Additionally, existing systems and protocols are mostly tailored {{to meet the requirements}} of specific application scenarios. As a result, the protocols cannot easily be adapted to novel application demands, organically growing networks, etc. Impeding the sharing of networking and system state, along with lacking support for dynamic transitions between systems and protocols, severely limits the ability to optimally manage resources and dynamically adapt to a desirable overall configuration. These limitations not only affect the network performance but also hinder the deployment of new and innovative protocols as a <b>hard</b> <b>break</b> is usually not feasible and thus full support for legacy systems is required. On the one hand, we propose a generalized way to collect, store, transform, and share context between systems and protocols in both the legacy Internet as well as NFV/SDN-driven networks. This allows us to share state information between multiple systems and protocols from NFs over BGP routers to protocols on all layers of the network stack. On the other hand, we introduce an architecture for designing modular protocols that are built with transition in mind. We argue that the modular design of systems and protocols can remove the key limitations of today’s monolithic protocols and allow for a more dynamic network management. First, we design and implement a Storage and Transformation Engine for Advanced Net- working context (STEAN) which constitutes a shared context storage, making network state information available to other systems and protocols. Its pivotal feature is the ability to allow for state transformation as well as for persisting state to enable future re-use. Second, we provide a Blueprint for Switching Between Mechanisms that serves as a framework and guideline for developers to standardize and ease the process of designing and implementing systems and protocols that support transitions as a first order principle. By means of experimentation, we show that our architecture covers a diverse set of challenging use cases in legacy systems—such as Wireless Multihop Networks (WMNs) —as well as in NFV/SDN-enabled systems. In particular, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by migrating state information between two instances of the PRADS NF in a virtualized Mininet environment, and show that our solution outperforms state of the art frameworks that are specifically built for NF migration. We further demonstrate that a dynamic switch between WMN routing protocols is possible at runtime and that the state information can be reutilized for bootstrapping novel protocol modules, thus minimizing the control overhead...|$|E
