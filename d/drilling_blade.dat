Distinguished from most traditional manual inspection approach, AOI is time-saving, objective and non contact. In this work, a pattern classification method is proposedfor the AOI of micro drill bit in PCB manufacturing, in which three features of <b>drill</b> bit <b>blade</b> are extractedfor classification. In order to be independent on the clamp that can guarantee the exact position of <b>drill</b> bit <b>blade</b> for photography, and reduce the cost of the AOI system, an image registration method is used to align the <b>drill</b> bit <b>blade,</b> which can also make the feature extraction much easier. The evaluation result indicates that the approach works wellfor the AOI ofmicro drill bit. It is real time, more detailed resultproviding and low requirement on photographic device...|$|R

The proposed spiral microrobot consists of a cylindrical body that contains a cylindrical magnet and spiral <b>drilling</b> <b>blades</b> on the shaft.

50|$|There {{had been}} {{settlement}} on {{this part of}} the Abens river since long before the High Middle Ages, dating back to Neolithic times. Of particular interest and national importance are the Neolithic flint mines at Arnhofen, where, around 7,000 years ago, Stone Age people made flint, which was fashioned into <b>drills,</b> <b>blades</b> and arrowheads, and was regarded as the steel of the Stone Age. Traces of over 20,000 individuals were found on this site. The modern history of Abensberg, which is often incorrectly compared with that of the 3rd century Roman castra (military outpost) of Abusina, begins with Gebhard, who was the first to mention Abensberg as a town, {{in the middle of the}} 12th century. The earliest written reference to the town, under the name of Habensperch, came from this time, in around 1138. Gebhard was from the Babonen clan.|$|R

Thirty-two male ice hockey players (mean age = 19 ± 2. 65 yrs.) representing the Ontario Minor Hockey Association (OMHA; Midget AAA and Junior), Canadian Inter University Sport (CIS: Varsity), Ontario hockey league (OHL) and East Coast Hockey League (ECHL), and the playing positions of forwards (n= 18) and defense (n= 14) were recruited to participate. Skate related equipment worn by the players for the {{purpose of the}} research was documented and revealed that 80 % of the players wore Bauer skates, Tuuk blade holders and LS 2 skate blades. Subjects completed a battery of eight on-ice skating drills used to measure and compare two aspects of skating speed; acceleration [T 1 (s) ] and total time to complete each drill [TT(s) ] while skating on three skate <b>blade</b> conditions. The <b>drills</b> represented skills used in the game of hockey, both in isolation (e. g., forward skating, backward skating, stops and starts, and cornering) and in sequence to simulate the combination of skills used in a shift of game play. The three blade conditions consisted of (i) baseline, represented by the blades worn by the player throughout their current season of play; (ii) experimental blades (EB), represented by brand name experimental blades with manufacturers radius of contour and a standardized radius of hollow; and (iii) customized experimental blades (CEB), represented by the same brand name experimental blades sharpened to the players’ preference as identified in the baseline condition. No significant differences were found in acceleration time [T 1 (s) ] or total time to complete [TT(s) ] the isolated <b>drills</b> across <b>blade</b> conditions; however significant differences were revealed in both T 1 (s) and TT(s) measured during the execution of the sequenced <b>drill</b> across <b>blade</b> conditions. A iii Bonferroni post hoc test revealed that players skated significantly faster when skating on the CEB condition compared to the baseline condition (p≤. 05). A questionnaire assessing subjects perceived comfort, confidence and effort expended while skating on the experimental blades revealed that players were significantly more comfortable when skating on the CEB versus the EB condition (p≤. 05). Outcomes of the study provide evidence to suggest that the experimental skate blades customized with the players preferred blade sharpening characteristics results in faster skating speed in a combination drill representing skills performed in gameplay...|$|R

The experiments are performed by 5 rows mechanical precision drilling machine. 8 sets of drill cultures were marked distinctively in order to be recognized later, their initial weighs were taken, and mounted randomly to the mostly used precision drilling machines in Afyon and Bor Sugar Factories.

40|$|AbstractHole {{accidents}} during {{drilling and}} borehole collapse during extracting are bottlenecks restricting gas drainage efficiency in soft outburst-prone coal seams in China.

After drilling is completed, the sieve tube is tripped in through the inner hole of drilling pipes, and then lifting up drilling pipes, the tube sieve will provide a complete tunnel for gas extraction. Field application proves that with proper drilling parameter selection and appropriate tube install control, it is more promising to double drilling depth and raise gas drainage efficiency...|$|R

Ideally, a jet engine should operate at very high temperatures to maximize fuel efficiency and power. Combustion gases are often held at temperatures above 1370 ° C, while engine metal superalloys have melting points that range between 1230 ° and 1315 ° C. As a result, engine turbine blades must be cooled by flowing air through holes <b>drilled</b> in the <b>blade</b> or be protected from the hot combustion gases by some form of thermal barrier. Cooling results in a rather minimal gain in allowable combustion gas inlet temperature; such a technique’s effectiveness is counterbalanced by a decrease in engine efficiency.
