5|$|The {{first public}} {{controversy}} regarding Zwingli's preaching broke {{out during the}} season of Lent in 1522. On the first <b>fasting</b> Sunday, 9 March, Zwingli and about a dozen other participants consciously transgressed the <b>fasting</b> rule by cutting and distributing two smoked sausages (the Wurstessen in Christoph Froschauer's workshop). Zwingli defended this act in a sermon which was published on 16 April, under the title Von Erkiesen und Freiheit der Speisen (Regarding the Choice and Freedom of Foods). He noted that no general valid rule on food {{can be derived from}} the Bible and that to transgress such a rule is not a sin. The event, which came to be referred to as the Affair of the Sausages, is considered to be the start of the Reformation in Switzerland. Even before the publication of this treatise, the diocese of Constance reacted by sending a delegation to Zurich. The city council condemned the <b>fasting</b> violation, but assumed responsibility over ecclesiastical matters and requested the religious authorities clarify the issue. The bishop responded on 24 May by admonishing the Grossmünster and city council and repeating the traditional position.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the changing nature}} of the quick-service food industry. From the introduction of the drive-in restaurant to the advent of the <b>fast</b> food industry to the niche market of <b>fast</b> casual dining we focus on the competitive environment that is clearly representative of a growing demand from value conscious consumers. Coupled with the economic growth post World War II, consumer preferences for <b>fast</b> and easy food options fueled the growth of the <b>fast</b> food industry. But not until the 19902 ̆ 7 s did we see competition for <b>fast</b> food firms from the <b>fast</b> casual niche sparked by changing consumer preferences. Most recently we see a merge between <b>fast</b> casual and <b>fast</b> food firms. We identify the difference between <b>fast</b> casual and <b>fast</b> food firms through a deep analysis of two of the most successful <b>fast</b> casual firms: Chipotle and Panera. By dissecting their cost structures it is clear where these firms succeed and by means of representation where <b>fast</b> casual firms have been most proficient at selling the new market idea. Then we dive into the areas in which <b>fast</b> food firms have adjusted their business models to attain market share back from <b>fast</b> casual firms. Some <b>fast</b> food firms have been successful while others fall by the wayside. Essentially, changing the identity of <b>fast</b> food to not only cheap and <b>fast</b> but also socially dignified and consumer driven. The firms that have been successful have pressured profit margins of <b>fast</b> casual firms and causing them to <b>fast</b> to meld business identities towards <b>fast</b> food firms. The result is a consolidation of the quick service market that has sparked the emergence of larger corporation as it becomes harder to survive...|$|R

And supposedly due to the deep, loud sound the agung produces, people believed that it possessed supernatural powers.
