40|$|My {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} the charters of the Worcester diocese from its foundation in approximately 680 to the tenth century. Bishops of Worcester, men is control of one of the wealthiest sees in Anglo-Saxon England, used charters to acquire land, obtain rights and privileges for their existing estates, and manage trade within limits imposed by the king. Rights associated with bookland, land held by charter, gave bishops and their agents the ability to <b>direct</b> <b>settlement</b> and field <b>systems</b> in order to maximize estate productivity and encourage trade through a system of urban and rural marketing of timber, salt, surplus foodstuffs, and other commodities. To isolate these processes, I study two aspects of charters from the Worcester archive. First, charters are responses to major political developments such as Viking invasions or the transition from Hwiccian to Mercian to West Saxon rule. Second, charters are legal instruments used to exert control over local land use and market conditions. Charters read from these perspectives enrich scholarship in a number of fields including political history, geography, archaeology, and textual studies. Charters written, copied, and archived by the religious community of Worcester linked all levels of Anglo-Saxons from the bishops and kings mentioned by name in the documents to the ordinary clerics, monks, and layfolk who managed and worked the land in ways that enrich our understanding of their daily lives...|$|R

Then use models to calculate <b>settlement</b> <b>systems</b> behavior. Specific of <b>settlement</b> <b>systems</b> requires that they perform accordingly to business rules in any situation. This makes use of model checking a very desirable step in development process of <b>settlement</b> <b>systems.</b> Defining a domain specific language and creating editor supporting it is a first step to enable use of model checking techniques.

40|$|While net <b>settlement</b> <b>systems</b> {{make more}} {{efficient}} use of liquidity than gross <b>settlement</b> <b>systems,</b> they are known to generate systemic risk. What does that tendency imply for {{the stability of the}} payments (or financial) system when the two <b>settlement</b> <b>systems</b> coexist? Do liquidity shortages induce banks to settle more transactions in the net <b>settlement</b> <b>system,</b> thereby increasing systemic risk? Or do banks require their counterparties to send payments through the gross <b>settlement</b> <b>system</b> when default risks are high, increasing the need for liquidity and the money market rate but reducing overall systemic risk? This paper studies the factors that drive the relative importance of net and gross <b>settlement</b> <b>systems</b> over the short run, using daily data on transaction volumes from the large- volume payment systems of all euro area countries that have had both a net and a gross <b>settlement</b> <b>system</b> at the same time. Applying a large portfolio of different econometric techniques, we find that it is actually the transaction volumes in gross <b>settlement</b> <b>systems</b> that affect the daily price of liquidity and the credit risk spread in money markets.

40|$|After a rapid {{expansion}} of financial transactions, both the authorities and financial institutions {{became aware of the}} risk involved in interbank <b>settlement</b> <b>systems.</b> To cope with the risk the systems in most economies have been designed so that large-sized payments are settled in the real time gross settlement (RTGS) mode, whereas small ones are dealt with in the designated time net <b>settlement</b> <b>system.</b> Yet the introduction of the RTGS system imposes substantial costs of maintaining intraday liquidity on participants, which creates a fear among European as well as Japanese banking communities that they might lose competitiveness against their US counterparts whose main <b>settlement</b> <b>system,</b> Fedwire, does not require collateral. We first compare these different <b>settlement</b> <b>systems</b> from the participant’s cost-benefit perspective and see if this concern always holds. Second, we develop the same framework to analyse the net <b>settlement</b> <b>system,</b> and then suggest if there is a rationale behind the coexistence of both the RTGS and net <b>settlement</b> <b>systems.</b> Intraday liquidity; Risk Management; RTGS; Settlement Risk...|$|R
