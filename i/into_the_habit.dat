25|$|When first discovered, Iapetus {{was among}} four Saturnian moons {{labelled}} the Sidera Lodoicea by their discoverer Giovanni Cassini after King Louis XIV (the other three were Tethys, Dione and Rhea). However, astronomers fell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>habit</b> of referring to them using Roman numerals, with Iapetus being Saturn V. Once Mimas and Enceladus {{were discovered in}} 1789, the numbering scheme was extended and Iapetus became SaturnVII. And {{with the discovery of}} Hyperion in 1848, Iapetus became Saturn VIII, which it is still known by today (see naming of natural satellites).|$|E
25|$|Cassini {{named the}} four new moons as Sidera Lodoicea ("the stars of Louis") to honour king Louis XIV of France. By {{the end of}} the seventeenth century, astronomers fell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>habit</b> of {{referring}} to them and Titan as SaturnI through SaturnV (Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, Iapetus). Once Mimas and Enceladus were discovered in 1789, the numbering scheme was extended to SaturnVII by bumping the older five moons up two slots. The discovery of Hyperion in 1848 changed the numbers one last time, bumping Iapetus up to SaturnVIII. Henceforth, the numbering scheme would remain fixed.|$|E

The community, including Ripley, had difficulty with the farming aspects of the community, in particular because of poor soil and not enough labor. The major crop was hay, though it was sold at low grade prices; vegetables, milk, and fruit were not produced in high enough numbers to be profitable.

Numerous small moons have been discovered closer to Saturn since then.|$|E
500|$|One of Delius's major wartime works was his Requiem, {{dedicated}} [...] "to {{the memory}} of all young Artists fallen in the war". The work owes nothing to the traditional Christian liturgy, eschewing notions of an afterlife and celebrating instead a pantheistic renewal of Nature. When Albert Coates presented the work in London in 1922, its atheism offended some believers. [...] This attitude persisted long after Delius's death, as the Requiem did not receive another performance in the UK until 1965, and by 1980 had still had only seven performances world-wide. In Germany, the regular presentation of Delius's works ceased at {{the outbreak of the}} war, and never resumed. Nevertheless, his standing with some continental musicians was unaffected; Beecham records that Bartók and Kodály were admirers of Delius, and the former grew <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>habit</b> of sending his compositions to Delius for comment and tried to interest him in both Hungarian and Romanian popular music.|$|E

500|$|The Beatles {{contains}} {{a wide range}} of musical styles, which the authors Barry Miles and Gillian Gaar each view as the most diverse of any of the group's albums. These styles include rock and roll, blues, folk, country, reggae, avant-garde, hard rock and music hall. The production aesthetic ensured that the album's sound was scaled-down and less reliant on studio innovation, relative to all the Beatles' releases since Revolver. The author Nicholas Schaffner viewed this as reflective of a widespread departure from the LSD-inspired psychedelia of 1967, an approach that was initiated by Bob Dylan and the Beach Boys and similarly adopted in 1968 by artists such as the Rolling Stones and the Byrds. Edwin Faust of Stylus Magazine described The Beatles as [...] "foremost an album about musical purity (as the album cover and title suggest). Whereas on prior Beatles albums, the band was getting <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>habit</b> of mixing several musical genres into a single song, on The White Album every song is faithful to its selected genre. The rock n' roll tracks are purely rock n' roll; the folk songs are purely folk; the surreal pop numbers are purely surreal pop; and the experimental piece is purely experimental." ...|$|E

[...] Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times wrote that he hated the episode, similarly calling [...] "Run Joey Run" [...] his favorite song, but noting that that was [...] "not hard considering the songbook that was offered". Kennedy deemed the [...] "Ice Ice Baby" [...] performance his least favourite moment of the entire series thus far. He concluded: [...] "Each of the musical numbers felt about two minutes longer than they should have been.

She played Scarlett, a teenage granddaughter of the corporation's chairman, described as spoiled and cruel, and generally annoying.

She voiced Chika Minazuki in Ai Yori Aoshi, a little cousin character. Way Jeng of [...] Mania.com described her performance as energetic, yet innocent and simple, but contrasting to Wendee Lee's voicing of Tina Foster. In 2005, she voiced the female lead character Fuu Kasumi in Samurai Champloo.

In this period he got <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>habit</b> of frequent reading, developed an interest in theatre, and started singing lessons. After {{graduating from high school}} in April 1942 he was drafted into the German Arbeitsdienst. After basic training in Pirmasens, Germany, he was assigned to a unit in Quelern en Bas, near Brest (France). Feyerabend described the work he did during that period as monotonous: [...] "we moved around in the countryside, dug ditches, and filled them up again." [...] After a short leave he joined the army and volunteered for officer school. In his autobiography he writes that he hoped the war would be over {{by the time he had}} finished his education as an officer. This turned out not to be the case. From December 1943 on, he served as an officer on the northern part of the Eastern Front, was decorated with an Iron cross, and attained the rank of lieutenant. When the German army started its retreat from the advancing Red Army, Feyerabend was hit by three bullets while directing traffic. One bullet hit him in the spine. As a consequence he needed to walk with a stick for the rest of his life and frequently experienced severe pain. He spent the rest of the war recovering from his wounds.|$|E
