5|$|Broccoli {{agreed to}} Wood's {{proposed}} changes, {{but before he}} could set to work there were more legal complications. In the years since Thunderball, Kevin McClory had set up two film companies and was trying to make a new Bond film in collaboration with Sean Connery and novelist Len Deighton. McClory <b>got</b> <b>wind</b> of Broccoli's plans to use SPECTRE, an organisation that had first been created by Fleming while working with McClory and Jack Whittingham on the very first attempt to film Thunderball, back even before it was a novel, in the late 1950s. McClory threatened to sue Broccoli for alleged copyright infringement, claiming that he had the sole right to include SPECTRE and its agents in all films. Not wishing to extend the already ongoing legal dispute that could have delayed the production of The Spy Who Loved Me, Broccoli requested Wood remove all references to Blofeld and SPECTRE from the script.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{was deeply}} {{concerned}} that Ernst Röhm, {{the chief of}} the SA, was planning a coup. Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich plotted with Göring to use the Gestapo and SS to crush the SA. Members of the SA <b>got</b> <b>wind</b> of the proposed action and thousands of them took to the streets in violent demonstrations on the night of 29 June 1934. Enraged, Hitler ordered the arrest of the SA leadership. Röhm was shot dead in his cell when he refused to commit suicide; Göring personally went over the lists of detainees—numbering in the thousands—and determined who else should be shot. At least 85 people were killed in the period of 30 June to 2 July, which is now known as the Night of the Long Knives. Hitler admitted in the Reichstag on 13 July that the killings had been entirely illegal, but claimed a plot had been under way to overthrow the Reich. A retroactive law was passed making the action legal. Any criticism was met with arrests.|$|E
5|$|The {{launch of}} the ZX81 was catalysed {{in part by the}} British Broadcasting Corporation's plan to produce a TV series, to be {{broadcast}} in 1982, aimed at popularising computing and programming. The BBC intended to commission an existing manufacturer to provide it with a BBC-branded home computer to tie in with the series. When Sinclair <b>got</b> <b>wind</b> of the project in December 1980, he wrote to the BBC informing them that he would be announcing {{a new version of the}} ZX80, to be called the ZX81, in early 1981. It would remedy some of the ZX80's deficiencies and would be both cheaper and more advanced. Sinclair naturally wanted the ZX81 to be a candidate for the BBC contract and lobbied for its adoption. He pointed out that there were already 40,000 users of the ZX80 and that by the time the series was broadcast there were likely to be upwards of 100,000 ZX81 users (which turned out to be an underestimate by over 400,000 – an indication of how the ZX81's success exceeded even Sinclair's expectations).|$|E

5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1957, Stompanato visited Turner in England, where she was filming Another Time, Another Place (1958), co-starring Sean Connery. In her autobiography, Turner said that she {{arranged}} for Stompanato's visit because she was lonely and having a difficult time filming. Their reunion was initially happy, but the two soon began fighting. Stompanato became suspicious when Turner would not allow him to visit the set and, during one fight, he choked her, causing her to miss three weeks of filming. Turner later wrote {{that she and her}} makeup man, Del Armstrong, called Scotland Yard in order to have Stompanato deported. Stompanato <b>got</b> <b>wind</b> of the plan and showed up on the set with a gun, threatening her and her co-star Sean Connery, whom he warned to keep away from Turner. Connery answered by grabbing the gun out of Stompanato's hand and twisting his wrist, causing him to run off the set sheepishly. Turner and Armstrong later returned with two Scotland Yard detectives to the rented house where she and Stompanato were staying. The detectives advised Stompanato to leave and escorted {{him out of the house}} and also to the airport, where he boarded a plane back to the United States.|$|E
25|$|Robert Fitzwalter of Baynard's Castle was {{the leader}} of the barons' revolt against King John which culminated in the Magna Carta of 1215. Fitzwalter plotted against King John in 1212, but John <b>got</b> <b>wind</b> of the plot and exiled Fitzwalter. Fitzwalter fled to France and on 14 January 1213 King John {{destroyed}} Castle Baynard. Stow reports that Robert Montfichet was also banished in 1213 and {{at least one of the}} Montfichet castles was demolished.|$|E
25|$|Judge Kenesaw M. Landis, {{the first}} Commissioner of Major League Baseball, was an {{intractable}} opponent of integrating the white majors. During his quarter-century tenure, he blocked all attempts at integrating the game. A popular story {{has it that}} in , Bill Veeck planned to buy the moribund Philadelphia Phillies and stock them with Negro League stars. However, when Landis <b>got</b> <b>wind</b> of his plans, he and National League president Ford Frick scuttled it in favor of another bid by William D. Cox.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} day, MacNeill <b>got</b> <b>wind</b> that {{a rising}} {{was about to}} be launched and threatened to do everything he could to prevent it, short of informing the British. MacNeill was briefly persuaded to go along with some sort of action when Mac Diarmada revealed to him that a German arms shipment was about to land in County Kerry. MacNeill believed that when the British learned of the shipment they would immediately suppress the Volunteers, thus the Volunteers would be justified in taking defensive action, including the planned manoeuvres.|$|E
25|$|His biographer tells {{a curious}} {{story of his}} {{activity}} in securing the election (1614) of John Davenant as master of Queens' in succession to Tyndal. George Montaigne, afterwards Archbishop of York, had his eye on this preferment; but immediately on Tyndal's death Preston rode post-haste to London, reaching Whitehall before day-break. Here he made interest with Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset, {{with a view to}} secure court sanction for the choice of Davenant. Returning to Cambridge, he had the election over before Montaigne <b>got</b> <b>wind</b> of the vacancy.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} raid at the meetinghouse, {{on the night}} of Aug 2, 1781, another raid took place. Hoping to ambush the Tories, Patriots hid behind a stone wall at the {{southeast}} corner of Nearwater Lane and the Boston Post Road. But the Tories <b>got</b> <b>wind</b> of the impending ambush and sneaked up themselves behind a wall on the opposite side. Gunfire ensued and when the smoke cleared several men were dead on both sides. The Tories were able to get to shore to row back across the sound in their whaleboats.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1940s, an {{anthropology}} student, Dr. Roffo, obtained permission to excavate. In pursuance of this, he used explosives to open Jedar B, {{from which he}} obtained a skeleton which was in a wooden coffin in a tomb excavated beneath the building; the same happened {{with one of the}} smaller jedars at Ternaten. The whereabouts of these skeletons is unknown (they may lie unrecognised in an Algerian museum) and Dr. Roffo, it is said, burnt most of his notes in a fit of pique after an argument with the Director of Antiquities (who had probably <b>got</b> <b>wind</b> of his methods of 'excavation').|$|E
25|$|On 1 February {{a formal}} {{reconciliation}} was concluded between Ocko tom Brok, {{the town of}} Groningen, Oostergo, Westergo, Hunsingo, Fivelgo, and the small territories of Vredewold, Langewold, and Humsterland. This took place behind John of Bavaria's back, and when he <b>got</b> <b>wind</b> of it, he demanded it to be rescinded. But {{at this point he}} had lost almost all his support in the Frisian territories. His last stronghold there was the city of Dokkum, on the north coast, which was held for him mainly by privateers, who preyed on the ships plying the trade route along the North Sea coast. At the end of May a fleet from the cities of Groningen, Hamburg, and Lübeck sailed to Dokkum, and drove the privateers out, thus depriving John of this last foothold on Frisian soil.|$|E
25|$|On {{the initial}} {{list of those}} to be arrested, which was drawn up by RUC Special Branch and MI5, there were 450 names, but only 350 of these were found. Key figures on the list, and many who never {{appeared}} on them, had <b>got</b> <b>wind</b> of the swoop before it began. The list included leaders of the non-violent Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association such as Ivan Barr and Michael Farrell. But, Tim Pat Coogan noted:What they did not include was a single Loyalist. Although the UVF had begun the killing and bombing, this organisation was left untouched, as were other violent Loyalist satellite organisations such as Tara, the Shankill Defence Association and the Ulster Protestant Volunteers. Faulkner was urged by the British to include a few Protestants in the trawl but, apart from two republicans, he refused.|$|E

25|$|Making {{matters worse}} from Penn's perspective, Philip Ford, his {{financial}} advisor, had cheated Penn out {{of thousands of}} pounds by concealing and diverting rents from Penn's Irish lands, claiming losses, then extracting loans from Penn to cover the shortfall. When Ford died in 1702, his widow Bridget threatened to sell Pennsylvania, to which she could prove title. Penn sent William to America to manage affairs, but he proved just as unreliable {{as he had been}} in England. There were considerable discussions about scrapping his constitution. In desperation, Penn tried to sell Pennsylvania to the Crown before Bridget Ford <b>got</b> <b>wind</b> of his plan, but by insisting that the Crown uphold the civil liberties that had been achieved, he could not strike a deal. Mrs. Ford took her case to court. At age 62, Penn landed in debtors' prison; however, a rush of sympathy reduced Penn's punishment to house arrest, and Bridget Ford was finally denied her claim to Pennsylvania. A group of Quakers arranged for Ford to receive a payment for back rents and Penn was released.|$|E
25|$|Sales of The Yellow Tape were jump-started {{when the}} band {{was taken off the}} bill for the 1991 New Year's Eve concert in Nathan Phillips Square outside Toronto City Hall because a staffer for then-mayor June Rowlands saw the band's name and felt it {{objectified}} women; the decision was further affirmed by city councillor Chris Korwin-Kuczynski. The band shrugged it off and booked another show at McMaster University. However, the media <b>got</b> <b>wind</b> of the story and decided to write about it as an example of political correctness gone too far. The first article earned the paper a large quantity of mail against City Hall's decision. The story became more and more prominent until about a week after New Years, when {{the band was}} asked to take a photo in front of City Hall for {{the front page of the}} Toronto Star. The stories targeted Rowlands even though she had not been directly involved in the decision to remove the band from the concert, but in fact had been out of town at the time. The following week, sales of the Yellow Tape exploded — by February 1992, it was outselling even Michael Jackson's Dangerous, Genesis' We Can't Dance and U2's Achtung Baby in some downtown Toronto record stores. They received enough publicity from the incident that MuchMusic offered them its second-ever Intimate and Interactive special on January 17. The tape eventually became the first ever indie release to achieve platinum status (100,000 copies) in Canada.|$|E

He believed that public interest would provide enough money both to build markers and maintain himself along the way.

500|$|Fitzwalter was {{the leader}} of the barons' revolt against King John which culminated in the Magna Carta of 1215. The Chronicle of Dunmow relates that King John desired Fitzwalter's daughter, Matilda the Fair, and Fitzwalter was forced to take up arms to defend the honour of his daughter. This romantic tale may well be {{propaganda}} giving legitimacy to a rebellion prompted by Fitzwalter's reluctance to pay tax or some other dispute. He plotted with the Welsh prince Llywelyn ab Iorwerth and Eustace de Vesci of Alnwick Castle in 1212. John <b>got</b> <b>wind</b> of the plot and exiled Fitzwalter and de Vesci, who fled to France and Scotland respectively. [...] On 14 January 1213 the king destroyed Castle Baynard. Fitzwalter was forgiven {{under the terms of the}} king's submission to Pope Innocent III in May 1213. His estates were restored on 19 July 1213 and according to Stow he was given licence to repair Castle Baynard and his other castles.|$|E
500|$|Four {{engineers}} responded: Edward Serrell, Samuel Keefer, Charles Ellet, Jr., and John Augustus Roebling. [...] All submitted {{designs for}} a suspension bridge. [...] At {{the time of}} the bidding, Ellet and Roebling were acknowledged as masters of suspension bridge building in America. [...] Roebling submitted two designs, a conservative single-deck suspension bridge and a double-decked version, both with meticulous calculations and drawings. [...] Instead of relying solely on submissions, Charles Ellet, Jr. took a proactive approach. [...] When he <b>got</b> <b>wind</b> of the project in 1845, he wrote to Charles B. Stuart, chief engineer of the Great Western Railway, boldly proclaiming that he could build a bridge for any likely purpose across the Niagara. [...] After the charters had been obtained, Ellet helped Stuart to sell the bridge companies' stock and offered to buy US$30,000 worth of stock himself. [...] His efforts earned him the $190,000 bridge contract on November 9, 1847.|$|E
500|$|Because {{the press}} barely covered the story, the affair would have faded quickly from public memory {{if not for}} {{journalist}} Ernest Parke. The editor of the obscure politically radical weekly The North London Press, Parke <b>got</b> <b>wind</b> of the affair {{when one of his}} reporters brought him the story of Newlove's conviction. Parke began to question why the prostitutes had been given such light sentences relative to their offence (the usual penalty for [...] "gross indecency" [...] was two years) and how Hammond had been able to evade arrest. His curiosity aroused, Parke found out that the boys had named prominent aristocrats. He subsequently ran a story on 28 September hinting at their involvement but without detailing specific names. It was only on 16 November that he published a follow up story specifically naming Henry Fitzroy, Earl of Euston, in [...] "an indescribably loathsome scandal in Cleveland Street". He further alleged that Euston may have gone to Peru and that he had been allowed to escape to cover up the involvement of a more highly placed person, who was not named but was believed by some to be Prince Albert Victor, the son of the Prince of Wales.|$|E
