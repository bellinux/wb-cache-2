The label serves as the integral part of the final product, which is then delivered as pre-decorated item. Combining the decoration process with the moulding process cuts the total cost, but can increase the manufacturing time.

A temporary PSP seaplane ramp, 25 ft wide, was completed by May 1943. At the end of June, another temporary PSP ramp was built for use by a second PBY squadron operating from the base. Construction of a 12,000-barrel tank farm including a <b>filling</b> <b>line</b> to the beach and a delivery line to the ramp was also completed together with 30 wooden buildings for administration and workshops. The PSP ramps were considered wholly satisfactory in service, and it was estimated that their substitution for concrete saved approximately two months' construction time.|$|E

5000|$|Inasmuch as, in this period, {{there was}} a {{centralized}} economy, Birra Tirana was distributed in 2/3 of the country, except the south-east part of Albania, that was furnished by Birra Korça. After the year 1983, around 50 percent of malt began to be imported. Together with {{the change in the}} political climate, including the liberlization of the market, different beers were imported from neighboring countries. As result of the image of these products as well as economic downturn, political and social chaos, the production and the sales in 1990-1992, fell by 4 percent.As result of the reform of economic decentralization, that the Albania Government undertook, the grocery combine [...] "Ali Kelmendi" [...] was disingrated in some separately establishments and the factory of Birra Tirana, passed as an independent establishment, with distinctive balance, registering under the name The establishment of the Production of Birra Malty, but the product's brand did not change. In 1993, with the grant of BE, via the Phare programme, were claimed 1,000,000 ECU, for the furniture with raw material (malt, hops), packages (bottles, cases), and also exchanges for the brush up to work of this factory. Birra Tirana began to compete successfully in market and its financial condition began to improve, creating such incomes, that not only liquidate in the state budget the fund about 100,000ECU, but even accomplishing further investments with machinery in Germany, for the <b>filling</b> <b>line,</b> packing, grinding, CO2 gas, filtration, furnaces, compressors for refrigeration, and even the lines of circulation of the beer and brine, all in steel.In this period was paid a special attention to the Marketing and to the analysis of the market in particular, {{with the help of the}} English specialists, Dutch and German. In base of this analysis, Birra Tirana created its strategy, improving evidently the image in market, via packing, publicity and promotion improvement, the enlargement of the distribution canal all over Albania, even competing with lower prices than import.Also the security standard was increased for the consumers, growing the long-life of this beer six months to one year via tunnel pasteurization. The establishment of the production of Malt Beer, passed in Albania with limited liability (Sh.p.k). Meanwhile, in 2000, it returned in shareholder Fellowship [...] "Birra Malt" [...] Sh.a, with the capital 100% state-owned. This was a step forward its denationalization. It can be said that, in the attended strategy by Albanian State against Birra Tirana, won the idea that the denationalization of the establishments in Albania would be more efficient, putting them in efficiency and not destroying them.In April 2001, [...] "Birra Malt" [...] Sh.a was denationalized by ten Albanians shareholders who have 96 percent of the shares, 2% the owner of the terrain and 2% of the workers. With its reorganization, and the breath, that brought the ten main shareholders, which had a long successful experience with their business, about the alteration of the work mentality and all these followed by business plans and by clear strategy of development, [...] "Birra Tirana" [...] has stated its goal to become the main beer in the Albania market. It is not traded only in Albania, but in Kosovo and America. This leap as consequence of the enlargement of the dimensions of the market, escaping the geographic confines of a strictly Albanian market, abandoning the idea that the market of Birra Tirana should be only Albanian.|$|E

This study encompasses two complementary parts, namely the sterilization in production {{and the application of}} a food safety system. The main objective was to validate the four autoclaves used for the sterilization of canned vegetables through heat penetration tests. The microbiological results of analyzed batches were verified to complete the study. The second part of this study aims at presenting the HACCP Plan of canned vegetables <b>filling</b> <b>line.</b> Three critical control points (CCP) were identified in the canned vegetable <b>filling</b> <b>line.</b> The first is the stage of choice, the second the crimping stage and the third the sterilization step. The lethality values obtained in all performed tests, by the two methods used, are above the minimum acceptable value, confirming thus the effectiveness of the company's sterilization system. However, there are some adjustments and revisions to be made in two autoclaves which do not sterilize at the reference temperature. It {{should also be noted that}} the microbiological results were negative for all lots. It is concluded that the Sumol+Compal sterilization system is effective and that the sterilized canned vegetables are safe from a microbiological point of view. The joint importance of the two areas covered by this study should be noted.

40|$|Process algebra is {{the study}} of {{distributed}} or parallel systems by algebraic means. Originating in computer science, process algebra has been extended in recent years to encompass not just discrete event, reactive systems, but also continuously evolving phenomena, resulting in so-called hybrid process algebras. A hybrid process algebra can be used for the specification, simulation, control and verification of embedded systems in combination with their environment, and for any dynamic system in general. As the vehicle of our exposition, we use the hybrid process algebra χ (Chi). The syntax and semantics of χ are discussed, and it is explained how equational reasoning can simplify, among others, tool implementations for simulation and verification. Finally, a bottle <b>filling</b> <b>line</b> example is introduced to illustrate system analysis by means of equational reasoning...|$|E
