5|$|The will, Balzac cautions, is a {{destructive}} force that seeks only to acquire power unless tempered by knowledge. The shopkeeper presents a foil for Valentin's future self, offering study and mental development {{as an alternative}} to consuming desire. Foedora also serves as a model for resistance to the corruption of will, insofar as she seeks at all times to excite desire in others while never giving <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own. That Valentin is happiest living in the material squalor of his tiny garret– lost in study and writing, with the good-hearted Pauline giving herself to him– underscores the irony of his misery {{at the end of the}} book, when he is surrounded with the fruits of his material desire.|$|E
5|$|While Prince Poniatowski and Kościuszko {{considered}} {{the outcome of}} the war still open, and were planning to use the combined Polish-Lithuanian forces to defeat the still separate Russian forces, King Poniatowski, with the consent of the Guardians of the Laws (cabinet of ministers) decided to ask for a ceasefire. Tsarina Catherine demanded that the King Poniatowski joins the pro-Russian aristocratic faction, the Targowica Confederation; with his cabinet split, he gave <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> demand around 22–23 July, which effectively forced Prince Poniatowski to terminate military resistance. The last military confrontation of the war was fought on 26 July at Markuszów in Lublin province, where an enemy attack was repelled by Polish cavalry led by Poniatowski.|$|E
5|$|The Bengalee, a reformist newspaper, {{presents}} a rare {{view of the}} true victim Elokeshi being forgotten in the debate of the trial and sympathy towards Nobin. In the First Meeting painting, Elokeshi is sometimes depicted as a courtesan, indicating {{that she is the}} one who seduces the mahant. She is often described as unchaste and to have developed the adulterous affair and even lived with him for some time {{despite the fact that he}} first rapes her. In one play, Elokeshi's character is debated by village wives and prostitutes. The wives vilify Elokeshi as an unchaste woman, question her devotion for Nobin and express the belief that a woman cannot be raped without her consent. The prostitutes empathise with Elokeshi, another victim of male lust and lament her fall from grace, which for them illustrates the brittle status of a wife. Some plays depict Elokeshi as having no choice but to surrender to the mahants lust on her father's command. Such plays concentrate more on scenes where Elokeshi gives <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> father's orders than on the depiction of rape.|$|E

This was further confirmed {{in an interview with}} Pitchfork Medias Jeremy Gordon, in which Banks said [...] "it got to a point where they were like, 'Azealia, we get it, you’re cool, but we've spent $2 million on this record, can you just give us one ?'

500|$|A {{critic for}} The Daily Telegraph found the video [...] "sultry".

He noted that she suffers from [...] "panda eyes {{after a good}} cry". Peter Gigas of E!

He noted that the clip is [...] "simple and straightforward", and connects effectively with viewers who like the ballad. A writer of Daily Mail noted that the scenes of Beyoncé and her love interest {{on the beach in}} the video were inspired from the film From Here to Eternity (1953).

This is a {{reference}} to a future plot in the episode [...] "Reaganing" [...] in which Liz is having intimacy issues because of a traumatic incident from her childhood that involved a poster of singer Tom Jones. Throughout the episode, Jack refers to the Fabian strategy, a strategy named after Roman general Fabius Maximus, which avoids direct battle in favor of attrition warfare. Jack uses the strategy as {{he does not want to}} say no to Avery or give <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> demands. In addition, Jack hails Fabius Maximus as his role model. When Carol surprises Liz at the TGS writers' room, staff writer J.D. Lutz (John Lutz) asks Carol if he is on Facebook, the latter being a social networking website. Later, Liz tells Jack not to interfere in her relationship with Carol, as she believes she has the perfect relationship with him. She reveals that she is modeling her life on that of chef Ina Garten of the Food Network show Barefoot Contessa. Jack responds by saying that Liz will never be like Garten, including the [...] "barefoot" [...] part, referring to the fact that Liz has never let anyone see her feet, which is a real life trait of Fey's.|$|E
500|$|Breathless {{shows up}} at Tracy's apartment, once again {{in an attempt to}} seduce him. Tracy shows he is only human by {{allowing}} her to kiss him. Tess witnesses this and eventually leaves town. Tracy leads a seemingly unsuccessful raid on Club Ritz, but it is actually a diversion so officer [...] "Bug" [...] Bailey can enter the building to operate a secretly installed listening device so the police can hear in on Big Boy's criminal activities. The resultant raids all but wipe out Big Boy's criminal empire. However, Big Boy discovers Bug and captures him for a trap planned by Influence and Pruneface to kill Tracy in the warehouse. In the resulting gun battle, a stranger with no face called [...] "The Blank" [...] steps out of the shadows to save Tracy after he is cornered and kills Pruneface. Influence escapes as Tracy rescues Bug from the same fate given to Lips Manlis, and Big Boy is enraged upon hearing that The Blank foiled the hit. Tracy tries again to get the testimony from Breathless he needs to put Big Boy away. She agrees to testify only if Tracy agrees to give <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> advances. Tess eventually has a change of heart, but before she can tell Tracy, she is kidnapped by The Blank, with the help of Big Boy's club piano player, 88 Keys.

500|$|Many {{scholars}} have {{noted in the}} conduct books that were very popular for settling out the proper rules for a young ladies in Austen's book there was a double meaning to the word modesty. Modesty meant both a woman should refrain from flamboyant behavior and be quiet while modesty also meant a woman had to be ignorant of her sexuality. This double meaning to modesty meant {{a young woman who}} was behaving in a modest way was not really modest at all as she attempting to conceal her knowledge of her sexuality, placing young women in an impossible position. Jan Fergus argued that for this reason that Austen's books were subversive by engaging in [...] "emotional didacticism" [...] by showing the reader moral lessons meant to teach young women how to be modest in the conventional sense, thus undercutting the demand made by the conduct books for modesty in the sense of ignorance of one's sexuality. Rachel Brownstein argued that Austen's use of irony should be seen in the same way, as a way of writing in a manner expected of a woman writer in her age while also undercutting such expectations at the same time. A very controversial article was [...] "Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl" [...] by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick that juxtaposed three treatments of female suffering, namely Marianne Dashwood's emotional frenzy when Willoughby abandons her, a 19th century medical account of the [...] "cure" [...] inflicted on a girl who liked to masturbate, and the critic Tony Tanner's [...] "vengeful" [...] treatment of Emma Woodhouse as a woman who had to be taught her place. Sedgwick argued the way that the portrayal of Marianne as emotionally overwrought and too inclined to give <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> feelings very closely resembled the account of patient X, the teenage girl seen as too inclined to masturbate and the way a male critic like Tanner attacked Woodhouse for her emotional self-indulgence was no different from the doctor imposing the gruesome and painful treatment on the masturbating girl. Sedwick the way that way Elinor disciplines Marianne, Tanner's [...] "vengeful" [...] views and the treatment given to patient X were all [...] attempts to crush female sexuality as she maintained that [...] "emotional self-indulgence" [...] was merely a code-word for female masturbation. Sedgwick argued that characters such as Dashwood and Woodhouse, who did not precisely conform to the feminine ideals are symbols of both female and homosexual resistance to the ideal of heterosexuality and patriarchy as the norm for everyone. Sedgwick's provoked an uproar in 1991, becoming a prime exhibit in the American [...] "Culture war" [...] between liberals and conservatives.|$|E

When Anu rejects her complaints, Ishtar threatens to raise the dead who will [...] "outnumber the living" [...] and [...] "devour them". Anu becomes frightened, and gives <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Ishtar leads Gugalanna to Uruk, and it causes widespread devastation.

Without any divine assistance, Enkidu and Gilgamesh attack and slay it, and offer up its heart to Shamash. When Ishtar cries out, Enkidu hurls one of the hindquarters of the bull at her. The city of Uruk celebrates, but Enkidu has an ominous dream about his future failure.|$|E

The ending of the anime differs from the manga {{when it comes to}} the final battle. Tama the nine-tailed fox is defeated by Himari, who chose to give <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> darkness (her vicious ayakashi side/energy) while fighting her.

With this added power, Himari goes to defeat Shuten-douji and wins, ending the anime after a characters reunion. When referring to Himari in the anime, distributor Kadokawa describes her character as old-fashioned with a demonic nature, who likes to snuggle.|$|E

Kheops moreover came to such a pitch of evilness, that being in want of money he sent his own daughter to a brothel and ordered her to obtain from those who came {{a certain amount of}} money (how much it was they did not tell me).

2500|$|The power {{exercised}} by a deity is legitimate, and this legitimacy justifies offerings and sacrifice. Unlike {{the gods of}} disease and death, spooks (apparitions) and demons have no such legitimacy. Whereas spooks – like the spectres of the dead – only frighten (and in that way, can also cause disease), demons are devourers; in practice, however, the borderline can be thin. One of the best-known spooks is an attractive woman maddening the men who give <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> lures (known in Yucatec as the xtabay 'Female Ensnarer'). Spooks of the Tzotziles include such figures as the 'charcoal-cruncher', the 'one who drops his own flesh', and 'white-bundle'. The boundary between spooks like these and the wayob of the Classic period is not always entirely clear. The principal demon of the Tzotzil area is the 'Black-man' (h?ik'al), a kidnapper and rapist. [...] An ancient Mesoamerican bird demon, which the Popol Vuh calls Vucub Caquix, severed the limbs of his victims, and was already known in Preclassic Izapa. In order to terrorize their enemies, kings would at times assume the shapes of spooks and demons. Bush spirits (such as the 'Wild Man' or Salvaje) belong to the frightening denizens of uninhabited areas, without, however, being apparitions.|$|E
2500|$|Boss Jefferson Davis [...] "J.D." [...] Hogg (Sorrell Booke) is {{the wealthiest}} man in Hazzard County and owns {{most of its}} {{property}} and businesses — whether directly or by holding the mortgages over the land. Usually dressed in an all-white suit, he is the fat, greedy, corrupt County Commissioner with visions of grandeur, a voracious appetite for food, who constantly orders Rosco to [...] "Get them Duke Boys!" [...] He is also Bo and Luke's Probation officer, when Bo and Luke need to leave Hazzard they always get permission from him. Boss Hogg is also married to (and dominated by) Rosco's [...] "fat sister" [...] (Lulu Hogg), a point that does not always sit well with either Boss Hogg or Rosco; Hogg sometimes claims that Rosco is indebted to him because of it, though his on-screen interactions with Lulu typically show him loving her deeply (and giving <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> stronger personality). In addition to his role as county commissioner {{he is also the}} police commissioner, land commissioner, and bank president. Boss is also the chief of the Hazzard Fire Department and the owner of or primary mortgage holder on most of the places in the county, including the Boar's Nest, Rhubottem's Store, Cooter's garage and the Duke Farm. It is implied in some episodes that he is the Justice of the Peace but in others Hazzard relies on a circuit judge. In the episode [...] "Coltrane vs. Duke", Hogg represents Rosco when he sues the Dukes, implying that he is a licensed attorney. His vehicle is a white 1970 Cadillac Coupe de Ville convertible, with bull horns mounted on the hood. In the first few seasons, he is almost always driven around by a chauffeur. His old moonshine-running car was called the [...] "Grey Ghost". Every morning, Boss Hogg would drink coffee and eat raw liver (Sorrell Booke, a method actor, actually ate the raw liver). Boss Hogg is described in one analysis as [...] "an ineffectual bad guy--hence amusing".|$|E
