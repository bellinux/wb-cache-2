The specific role of this cluster in heart and lung development remains unclear, but the observations described above show that these miRNAs are normally highly expressed in embryonic lung and decrease with maturity. Moreover, transgenic expression of these miRNAs specifically in lung epithelium results in severe developmental defects with enhanced proliferation andinhibition of differentiation of epithelial cells.Furthermore, mouse hematopoiesis occurring in the absence of miR-17-92 leads to an <b>isolated</b> <b>defect</b> in B cell development.|$|E
50|$|Amelia may {{be present}} as an <b>isolated</b> <b>defect,</b> but it is often {{associated}} with major malformations in other organ systems. These frequently include cleft lip and/or palate, body wall defects, malformed head, and defects of the neural tube, kidneys, and diaphragm. Facial clefts may be accompanied by other facial anomalies such as abnormally small jaw, and missing ears or nose. The body wall defects allow internal organs to protrude through the abdomen. Head malformations may be minor to severe with a near absence of the brain. The diaphragm may be herniated or absent and one or both kidneys may be small or absent.|$|E

In chapter 1, I will briefly review the major strength of quantum information processing over classical computation.

40|$|The {{vibrations}} in {{the vertical}} {{plan of the}} railway vehicles are mainly initiated by the interaction with the track that can have nivelment defects due to its construction. The maximum values of such defects correspond to the <b>isolated</b> <b>defects</b> that lead to a higher intensity of the vibrations behaviour of the vehicle while crossing them and, hence, this situation needs to be considered when evaluating the dynamic behaviour of the railway vehicle.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} and interactions of edge dislocations in a nearly aligned sheared lamellar mesophase is analysed to provide {{insights into the}} relationship between disorder and rheology. First, the mesoscale permeation and momentum equations for the displacement field {{in the presence of}} external forces are derived from the model H equations for the concentration and momentum field. The secondary flow generated due to the mean shear around an <b>isolated</b> <b>defect</b> is calculated, and the excess viscosity due to the presence of the defect is determined from the excess energy dissipation due to the secondary flow. The excess viscosity for an <b>isolated</b> <b>defect</b> is found to increase with system size in the cross-stream direction as L- 3 / 2 for an <b>isolated</b> <b>defect,</b> though this divergence is cut-off due to interactions in a defect suspension. As the defects are sheared past each other due to the mean flow, the Peach-Koehler force due to elastic interaction between pairs of defects is found to cause no net displacement relative to each other as they approach from large separation to the distance of closest approach. The equivalent force due to viscous interactions is found to increase the separation for defects of opposite sign, and decrease the separation for defects of same sign. During defect interactions, we find that there is no buckling instability due to dilation of layers for systems of realistic size. However, there is another mechanism, which is the velocity difference generated across a slightly deformed bilayer due to the mean shear, which could result in the creation of new defects.

40|$|Abstract: Background. <b>Isolated</b> <b>defects</b> in the {{cervical}} esophagus {{in patients}} who have not undergone total laryngec-tomy are uncommon. We report 2 cases of rare esophageal tumors requiring reconstruction of the cervical esophagus after tumor resection. Methods and Results. The patients were a 51 -year-old woman with an esophageal granular cell tumor and a 54 -year-old woman with an esophageal schwannoma. Both defects were reconstructed with a radial forearm flap. A small subclinical leak developed in 1 patient and healed spontaneously within 2 weeks. At 1 year and 2 years of follow-up, both patients were consuming a normal diet and had normal voices. Conclusions. A thin and well-vascularized flap such as the radial forearm flap is essential for reconstructing an <b>isolated</b> cervical esophageal <b>defect</b> so as to maximize functional outcome.

40|$|Light-induced {{degradation}} of {{hydrogenated amorphous silicon}} (a−Si:H), known as the Staebler-Wronski effect, has been studied by time-domain pulsed electron-paramagnetic resonance. Electron-spin echo relaxation measurements in the annealed and light-soaked state revealed two types of defects (termed type I and II), which can be discerned by their electron-spin echo relaxation. Type I exhibits a monoexponential decay related to indirect flip-flop processes between dipolar coupled electron spins in defect clusters, while the phase relaxation of type II is dominated by H 1 nuclear spin dynamics and is indicative for isolated spins. We propose that defects are either located at internal surfaces of microvoids (type I) or are isolated and uniformly distributed in the bulk (type II). The concentration of both defect type I and II is significantly higher in the light-soaked state compared to the annealed state. Our results indicate {{that in addition to}} <b>isolated</b> <b>defects,</b> defects on internal surfaces of microvoids play a role in light-induced {{degradation of}} device-quality a−Si:H...|$|R
