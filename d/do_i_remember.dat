2500|$|Compton was {{evacuated}} {{for severe}} trench foot; Stephen E. Ambrose concluded that Compton witnessing the carnage involving {{two of his}} closest friends, Joe Toye and William Guarnere [...] "unnerved" [...] him. Compton wrote in his autobiography, [...] "...although I was affected by the horrors of Bastogne, I do not believe I was clinically shell shocked, as the series portrays me. In real life, while I was hollering for the medic, {{trying to figure out}} what to <b>do,</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> two distinct thoughts: How are we going to help the wounded guys?...Maybe this is the time the Germans are really going to get us all." ...|$|E
60|$|Rage {{filled me}} at the words. Seldom <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> being so angry.|$|E
6000|$|... "So you <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> now. How extraordinary----" [...] Tuppence tailed {{off into}} silence. Suddenly she aroused herself. [...] "Tommy!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, yes; ah, yes--so they <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> now. You told me. Bad {{business}} that, my dear Baxter. Mr. Peters {{gave me that}} scarab. He will be most deucedly annoyed if it's lost. Yes, indeed." ...|$|R
60|$|This was {{the first}} I {{had heard of the}} man called Jesus, and I little remarked it at the time. Not until {{afterward}} <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> him, when the little summer cloud had become a full-fledged thunderstorm.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{was then}} I thought, {{for the first}} time, of {{fastening}} the murder upon him. It was then I dressed him in my clothes, and dragged him down the back-stairs to the piece of water. <b>Do</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> listening to the bubbles that came rising up when I had rolled him in? <b>Do</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> wiping the water from my face, and because the body splashed it there, in its descent, feeling as if it MUST be blood? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was in {{the summer}} of 2013 that the Plague came. I was twenty-seven years old, and well <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> it. Wireless despatches--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay!" [...] said Bernard, [...] "well <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> their bread; {{we asked}} if it was made of fir-bark, like that of our brethren of Norway." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh you, Mr. Bilham," [...] {{she replied}} as with an {{impatient}} rap on the glass, [...] "you're not worth sixpence! You {{come over to}} convert the savages--for I know you verily <b>did,</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> you--and the savages simply convert YOU." ...|$|R
60|$|Small wonder, in this tense {{passage of}} time, that I had {{forgotten}} the Samurai. Nor <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> him until the chart-house door swung open and I caught him by the arm. He steadied and swayed beside me, while he watched that cruel picture of rock and snow and spouting surf.|$|R
5000|$|Yishayahu Schachar, Jewish {{survivor}} who encountered Csat√°ry, said: [...] "I worked {{outside the}} ghetto in the brick factory, cleaning. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> Csatary loudly screaming orders at Jews. I didn't work under him but heard the terrible things he <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> women digging a ditch {{with their hands}} on his orders. He was an evil man and I hope he is brought to justice." [...] Yishayahu Schachar (2012) ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thereupon the spectre told {{me exactly}} where the {{treasure}} lay, and how to find it. It might be only yesterday so well <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> every word he spoke.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is verily, sir. Well <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> you, good trusty Captain, and the goodly lady your wife. Do I see her here?" [...] {{returned}} the clergyman, who had heartily grasped Richard's hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Robert! {{how do you}} <b>do?</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> {{you very}} well: you used {{to give me a}} ride {{sometimes}} on Miss Georgiana's bay pony. And how is Bessie? You are married to Bessie?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed you <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> it perfectly. You {{mentioned}} it as what was certainly {{to be very}} soon. Mrs. Perry had told somebody, and was extremely happy about it. It was owing to her persuasion, as she thought his being out in bad weather did him {{a great deal of}} harm. You must remember it now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|My {{reply to}} this was, I am afraid, rather absently given. The truth is, {{my mind was}} running on some earlier words which had dropped from the old lady's lips. [...] "He once did me a {{kindness}} a long time since." [...] When had I last heard that commonplace phrase? and why <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> it so readily when I now heard it again? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{called me}} so once, sir, when I should have chided you and <b>did</b> not. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> it well. You were very wrong, and I was very foolish." ...|$|R
6000|$|Well <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> that flaming Jew's [...] "With {{the last}} breath all is done: joy, love, sorrow, macaroni, the theatre, lime-trees, {{raspberry}} drops, {{the power of}} human relations, gossip, the barking of dogs, champagne." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! Admiral Bluewater, you, {{who have}} so wide-spread a {{reputation}} for sobriety and correct deportment! Well <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> how I trembled, when I heard your name mentioned {{as one of the}} leading members of that dreadful court!" ...|$|E
60|$|Looking back, as I was saying, {{into the}} blank of my infancy, the first objects I can {{remember}} as standing out by themselves from a confusion of things, are {{my mother and}} Peggotty. What else <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember?</b> Let me see.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{scarcely}} remember--she gave me so many. She abounds, poor dear, in reasons. But there's one that, {{whatever she}} <b>does,</b> <b>I</b> always <b>remember</b> for myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|So we <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> it yet. The {{people who}} sailed in the Flora that night may forget {{some other things}} if they live a good while, {{but they will not}} live long enough to forget that. The Flora is about the {{equivalent}} of a cattle-scow; but when the Union Company find it inconvenient to keep a contract and lucrative to break it, they smuggle her into passenger service, and [...] "keep the change." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{broke out}} {{suddenly}} with some declamation <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>remember.</b> <b>I</b> {{know that it}} was sincere, and that my wish and aim were to absolve her to herself. In fact, in her case self-accusation was a chimera.|$|R
6000|$|... "You English are a hardy {{folk who}} take the spring air so early. Well, in such company I would do the same. Truly she is a {{beauteous}} maiden. I have some experience of the sex, but never <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> one so fair." ...|$|E
60|$|My friend, Sir Melmoth Osborn, {{who died}} in or about the year 1897, was present at this battle, {{although}} not as a combatant. Well <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> his thrilling story, told to me over thirty years ago, {{of the events of}} that awful day.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, well <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> her, and how {{she used}} to let us nestle {{in her lap and}} sing to us. She sang like thee, Elleen, and was as mother-like as Mary is to the weans, but she was much blithesomer--at least before our father was slain.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then how can {{you tell}} what your {{feelings}} would be if you were to attempt to <b>do</b> it. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> once, when <b>I</b> was a boy, going out to hunt cats." ...|$|R
5000|$|Aaron Fields of KSTW.com stated: [...] "First single off the album, yet didn't {{have the}} success like [...] "Let me love you" [...] <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> {{thinking}} he was definitely back when I heard this song. I'm not sure why this song didn't get more attention as {{it is one of}} the better songs done by him, nevertheless I probably would have picked this for the first single as well. I still bump this one in the car." ...|$|R
6000|$|Thus, as {{a sample}} of my rovings: in a single {{interval}} of fifteen minutes of subconsciousness I have crawled and bellowed in the slime of the primeval world and sat beside Haas--further and cleaved the twentieth century air in a gas-driven monoplane. Awake, <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> that <b>I,</b> Darrell Standing, in the flesh, during the year preceding my incarceration in San Quentin, had flown with Haas further over the Pacific at Santa Monica. Awake, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>remember</b> the crawling and the bellowing in the ancient slime. Nevertheless, awake, I reasoned that somehow <b>I</b> had <b>remembered</b> that early adventure in the slime, {{and that it was}} a verity of long-previous experience, when I was not yet Darrell Standing but somebody else, or something else that crawled and bellowed. One experience was merely more remote than the other. Both experiences were equally real--or else how <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> them? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said her}} cousin, [...] "so <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> him. He has crossed my path many times since, Virginia. And mark what I say--it was he whom {{you had in}} mind on that {{birthday}} when you implored me {{to make something of}} myself, It was Stephen Brice." ...|$|E
60|$|A little lad {{of seven}} was I at the time, and well <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> the martial stir and bustle {{there was about}} our citadel of Mondolfo, the armed multitudes that thronged the {{fortress}} that was our home, or drilled and manoeuvred upon the green plains beyond the river.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, marry I <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> when I was a lad, in {{my first}} voyage, laying hold on one. I warrant you I danced about till I was nearly overboard, and my arm was as big as two for three days later. Is the fellow of that sort? The false Scot." ...|$|E
60|$|Well <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> Mrs. Reed's face, and I eagerly {{sought the}} {{familiar}} image. It {{is a happy}} thing that time quells the longings of vengeance and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion. I had left this woman in bitterness and hate, and I {{came back to her}} now with no other emotion than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong yearning to forget and forgive all injuries--to be reconciled and clasp hands in amity.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have always}} admired her complexion," [...] replied Emma, archly; [...] "but <b>do</b> not <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> {{the time when}} you found fault with her for being so pale?--When we first began to talk of her.--Have you quite forgotten?" ...|$|R
5000|$|On a broiling day, I ran to a {{screening}} of Contact, the Jodie Foster flick about messages from another galaxy. I made it for the opening credits, and, panting heavily - which, with all due respect, {{is not something that}} <b>I</b> find myself <b>doing</b> that often in Jodie Foster films - I started taking notes. These went [...] "v. gloomy", [...] "odd noir look for sci-fi", [...] "creepy shadows in outdoor scene", and so on. Only after three-quarters of an hour <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> to remove my dark glasses.|$|R
