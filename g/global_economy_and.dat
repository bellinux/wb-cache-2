5|$|Buoyed by a {{recovering}} <b>global</b> <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> ETOPS approval, 767 sales accelerated in the mid-to-late 1980s; 1989 {{was the most}} prolific year with 132 firm orders. By the early 1990s, the wide-body twinjet had become its manufacturer's annual best-selling aircraft, despite a slight decrease due to economic recession. During this period, the 767 became the most common airliner for transatlantic flights between North America and Europe. By {{the end of the}} decade, 767s crossed the Atlantic more frequently than all other aircraft types combined. The 767 also propelled the growth of point-to-point flights which bypassed major airline hubs in favor of direct routes. Taking advantage of the aircraft's lower operating costs and smaller capacity, operators added non-stop flights to secondary population centers, thereby eliminating the need for connecting flights. The increased number of cities receiving non-stop services caused a paradigm shift in the airline industry as point-to-point travel gained prominence {{at the expense of the}} traditional hub-and-spoke model.|$|E

Dr. Stiglitz argues that through tariffs, subsidies, an over-complex patent system and pollution, the world is being both economically and politically destabilised. Stiglitz argues that strong, transparent institutions are needed to address these problems. He shows how an examination of incomplete markets can make corrective government policies desirable.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{electrical}} telegraph, ancient civilizations, such as Greece, Egypt, and China, transmitted long-distance information using drumbeats, flame beacons, or light flashes with a heliograph. Later, nearly all information {{was limited to}} traveling {{at the speed of}} a human or animal. The telegraph freed communication from the time constraints of postage and revolutionized the <b>global</b> <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> society. By the end of the 19th century, the telegraph was becoming an increasingly common medium of communication for ordinary people. The telegraph isolated the message (information) from the physical movement of objects or the process.|$|E

Presently there is no integrated Information System available in the Public Space for recording, analyzing and reporting on Emerging Diseases. IDS ONLINE will meet the need for effectively managing the emerging infectious disease by providing a detailed demographic profile on the incidence of {{infectious diseases}}. This initiative will bridge the gap between the actual scenarios at the field level and the decision making process at the management level. Also the Research data so available will be useful for healthcare professionals and researchers for further research and effective management of future outbreaks.

25|$|The Bretton Woods {{agreement}} codified {{this economic}} {{dominance of the}} dollar after the war. In 1944, Allied nations sought to create an international monetary order that sustained the <b>global</b> <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> prevented the economic malaise that followed the First World War. The Bretton Woods agreement laid the foundations for an international monetary order that created rules and expectations for the international economic system. It created the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the predecessor of the World Bank, and an international monetary system based on fixed exchange rates. It valued the dollar at $35 per ounce of gold and the remaining signatories pegged their respective currency relative to the dollar, leading some economists to argue that Bretton Woods “dethroned” gold as the default asset.|$|E

The US needs to consolidate the foundation of future economic growth, improve education, encourage innovation, increase investment and conduct financial reform. China needs to build a new growth mode, expand domestic demand and improve its market economy and financial system. The reforms of the US and China do not have any conflict but can help each other. The cooperation between the US and China is critical to the health and stability of the <b>global</b> <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> the two countries should cope with challenges together.|$|E

500|$|From 2003, {{the demand}} for new ships started to grow, {{resulting}} in 2007 in a record breaking order backlog for shipyards, exceeding their capacity with rising newbuilding prices as a result. This resulted in a glut of ships when demand dropped due to a weakened <b>global</b> <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> dramatically reduced demand in the United States. The charter rate for very large crude carriers, which carry two million barrels of oil, had peaked at $309,601 per day in 2007, and has dropped, as of 2012, to $7,085 per day, far below the operating costs of these ships. [...] As a result, several tanker operators laid up their ships. Prices rose significantly in 2015 and early 2016, but delivery of new tankers was projected to keep prices in check.|$|E
