40|$|A recent French merger case {{involving}} two large water companies seems to toll {{the death of}} ex-post merger control. This paper aims at highlighting the interest of that type of control by showing its crucial role for competition authorities as a complement of the current notification system. Stressing the limits of an exclusively <b>ex-ante</b> <b>control,</b> we show that the possibility to act ex-post on market structures would lead to more virtuous behaviors in the <b>ex-ante</b> <b>control</b> by reducing adverse selection effects. The ex-post merger control would also permit new means of action on agents’ behaviors after the merger. Despite those positive effects, the implementation of an ex-post merger control should be attentively carried out in particular because some legal security problems could emerge. However, those issues might be offset by increasing the competence of the French competition authority in merger cases. ...|$|E

50|$|In {{response}} to the Wise Men's report, an Administrative Reform Task Force {{was set up to}} draft the Reform White papers. The task force looked at financial controls, strategic planning and programming and the modernisation of personnel policy. The basis for establishing the IAS was recommendation 35 of the Wise Men's report proposing A professional and independent Internal Audit Service. Recommendation 37 also mentioned a specialised internal control function in each DG that would help establishing effective financial management. The Commission task force worked with the European Court of Auditors, the Wise Men committee, the World Bank and the EIB in developing the new control framework. Before this could be implemented, the Financial Regulation of the Commission needed to be changed (requiring a vote by all member states) to abolish the centralized <b>ex-ante</b> <b>controls</b> performed by DG Financial Control.|$|R

In particular, I focus on the council on {{educational}} policy and the educational outline for annual performance in prefectures and designated cities, using an analysis of aggregate data. According to the principal-agent theory, this system gives them a power to control over the Boards of Education by mayors. The following is the finding of this research. In some municipalities, mayors tend to strengthen a control over the Boards of Education: on the other hand, in the other municipalities, mayors tend to loosen a control over the Boards of Education. As a result, mayors do not always exert power to control the Boards of Education...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest for business organizations to engage into the global inter-firm alliance nowadays. The companies are striving for accessing the opportunities created by emerging markets, diversification of the products’ offer or the access to lower cost inputs (Barnes, et al., 2010). However, along with the benefits, there are also risks that the inter-firm alliances are challenged with. Those risks are represented by various forms of opportunistic behavior, which might be further caused by business partners (Williamson, 1975). The companies that decide to engage into inter-firm alliance need {{to invest in the}} implementation of control mechanisms that will protect them against opportunistic behavior. The preventing exante mechanisms can be implemented prior to the official start of cooperation while the cause ex-post mechanisms are applied during further stage of the collaboration. However, due to the cost of these implementations, companies cannot afford employing every available control mechanism. They need to select only the ones that their benefits exceed their costs. One of the main factors that influence the selection process of control mechanisms is the level of knowledge sensitivity of a product. The main objective of this master thesis is to determine how the level of knowledge sensitivity of a product influences the selection of <b>ex-ante</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Epidemiological models {{enable to}} better {{understand}} the dynamics of infectious diseases and to assess <b>ex-ante</b> <b>control</b> strategies. For Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map), possible transmission routes have been described, but Map spread in a herd and the relative importance of the routes are currently insufficiently understood to prioritize control measures. We aim to predict early after Map introduction in a dairy cattle herd whether infection is likely to fade out or persist, when no control measures are implemented, using a modelling approach. Both vertical transmission and horizontal transmission via the ingestion of colostrum, milk, or faeces present in the contaminated environment were modelled. Calf-to-calf indirect transmission was possible. Six health states were represented: susceptible, transiently infectious, latently infected, subclinically infected, clinically affected, and resistant. The model was partially validated by comparing the simulated prevalence with field data. Housing facilities and contacts between animals were specifically considered for calves and heifers. After the introduction of one infected animal in a naive herd, fadeout occurred in 66 % of the runs. When Map persisted, the prevalence of infected animals increased to 88 % in 25 years. The two main transmission routes were via the farm's environment and in utero transmission. Calf-to-calf transmission was minor. Fadeout versus Map persistence could be differentiated with the number of clinically affected animals, which was rarely above one when fadeout occurred. Therefore, early detection of affected animals is crucial in preventing Map persistence in dairy herds. </p...|$|E

This complexity precludes not only from anticipate the effects of this innovation on populations, but it prevents from setting <b>ex-ante</b> rules, <b>controls</b> or any other form of truly reliable effects monitoring.

40|$|There has {{not been}} much {{discussion}} of how firms may assess the value of service innovation projects ex-ante in the extant research literature. This paper theoretically derives a value assessment tool for service innovation ideas called QSI (tool for pre-Qualification of Service Innovation projects). Thereafter QSI is implemented in three firms and it is explored to what degree the implementation improved managerial decision making on service innovation projects and investments. The findings indicated that the implementation of QSI had effects both in a portfolio management and a project management perspective. From a portfolio management point of view deployment of QSI improved the participating managers' decision basis for prioritizing and selection of projects. From a project management point of view implementation of QSI enabled the participating managers to define more relevant, realistic and ambitious targets for service innovation projects than {{they were able to}} define without deploying the tool.

40|$|I {{examine the}} effect of {{creditor}} control rights on borrowers’ financing policy both ex-ante and ex-post. The novelty introduced by this thesis is the use of an investor protection variable reflecting the pledgeability of a firm’s assets, both at industry and country level, alongside the contractual allocation of control rights, in understanding financial contracting and capital structure mechanics. At industry level, the empirical analysis is first motivated with a model that allows debt contracts to allocate control rights over the reorganization or liquidation decision of distressed firms and where cash flow pledgeability can vary. The model delivers two main predictions: (1) Ex-post, creditor control should be associated with an increased likelihood of resolving financial distress out of court relative to filing for bankruptcy, particularly in industries where assets are easier to collateralize; (2) <b>Ex-ante,</b> creditor <b>control</b> should be associated with an increased use of leverage, particularly in industries where assets are easier to collateralize. Empirical results provide evidence consistent with these two predictions. At country level, strong judicial effectiveness is found to alleviate {{the effect of}} the contractual enforcement of rights by creditors on financing policy. Net debt issuing activity declines sharply following a covenant violation, when creditors use their contractual acceleration and termination rights to increase interest rates or halt any further supply of credit. The decline is however found to be less pronounced in countries with stronger legal enforcement. This result is also observable for a variety of financial and investment policy measures including capital expenditures, asset growth and cash holdings, therefore highlighting the importance of strong contract enforcement in reducing financial and investment conservatism following a covenant violation and improving firm performance.

40|$|Randomized {{experiments}} {{are seen as}} the most rigorous methodology for testing causal explanations for phenomena {{in the social sciences}} and are experiencing a resurgence in political science. The classic experimental design randomly assigns the population of interest into two groups, treatment and <b>control.</b> <b>Ex-ante</b> these two groups should have identical distributions in terms of their observed and unobserved characteristics. Treatment is administered based upon assignment, and by the assumptions of the Rubin Causal Model the average effect of the treatment is calculated as the difference between the average outcome in the group assigned to treatment and the average outcome in the group assigned to control. Randomized {{experiments are}} often conducted within a multilevel setting. These settings can be defined both at the level at which the randomization occurs {{as well as at the}} level at which the treatment is both directly and indirectly administered.

40|$|In {{response}} to the global Önancial crisis a new policy paradigm emerged in which capital controls and other quantitative restrictions on credit áows {{have become part of}} the standard crisis prevention policy toolkit. A new strand of theoretical literature studies the use of capital controls in a context in which pecuniary externality justiÖes policy interventions. Within the same theoretical framework adopted in this literature, we show that the optimal design of crisis prevention (ex-ante) policies depends on the e§ectiviness of crisis management (ex-post) policies. This interaction between ex-ante and ex-post policies gives rise to a new rationale for the use of capital controls. SpeciÖcally, we show that when ex-post policies are e§ective in containing crises, {{there is no need to}} intervene <b>ex-ante</b> with capital <b>controls.</b> On the other hand, if crises management policies entail e¢ ciency costs and hence lose e§ectiveness, then the optimal policy mix consists of both ex-ante and ex-post interventions so that crises prevention policies become desirable. In our model, the optimal policy mix combines capital controls in tranquil times with real exchange rate support to limit its depreciation during crises times and yields welfare gains of more than 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{doctoral}} project {{reported in}} this thesis was carried out {{as an integral part}} of the larger TIPVIS project (Service Innovation Research Project in the Norwegian Graphic Arts Industry). This project aimed to improve the participating firms’ ability to carry out service innovation activities. Several managers participating in TIPVIS emphasized the importance of ex-ante value assessment, and were concerned about the paucity of guidance offered by the extant research literature on the design of value assessment tools. The aim of this thesis was therefore to propose a design of a value assessment tool for service innovation ideas. Knowledge of relevant existing best practices and of the potential effects of service innovation are necessary when constructing a value assessment tool. However, these topics have not been discussed much in the service innovation literature. Four studies were undertaken to help fill these literature gaps. An exploratory study provided insights about best practices. A literature review produced an overview of the potential effects of service innovation. A conceptual study explored the relationship between service innovation and sustained competitive advantage, and an explanatory study detailed the relationship between service innovation and financial performance. By combining the findings of the four studies with general insights from the research stream on innovation investment appraisal, this thesis develops a value assessment tool for service innovation ideas, called the QSI (tool for pre-Qualification of Service Innovation projects). The proposed QSI design is composed of three modules that combine business strategy methods, scenario analysis, capital investment-appraisal techniques, scoring models, and foresight methods. The tool was tested with real service innovation ideas in three firms using an interventionist research approach, and the QSI implementation was found to provide considerable assistance to the managers. The findings of this study thus have evident implications for <b>ex-ante</b> management <b>control</b> of service innovation activities. This thesis further suggests that the findings may also have implications for the design of developmental, ex-post, and strategic management control systems for service innovation activities. The thesis contributes theoretically to the research streams on innovation effects and on management control of innovation activities. These contributions establish a foundation for further research in these areas. nhhph...|$|R
40|$|Termination of a {{telephone}} call can only be realized by the network operator of the receiving party. For this reason, the markets for fixed and mobile call termination are regulated <b>ex-ante</b> including price <b>control.</b> To determine the costs of call termination the current regulatory regime considers only {{those parts of the}} network where customers compete for jointly used resources (mainly bandwidth). Therefore, the critical border is the "demarcation point" between the end customer dedicated access network and the aggregation network where customers compete for bandwidth. In addition to the extent of the overall network cost to be considered (depending on the location of the demarcation point) the traffic share of the voice termination service (which determines how much of the relevant cost is borne by voice termination) compared to all the other services sharing the same NGN/ NGA network needs to be taken into account. We analyse the cost effects with a cost model, which considers the part of the access network from the MPoP to the demarcation point, where the dedicated (access) network begins, in detail. This allows us to compare the impact of different demarcation points and service scenarios on the level of voice termination rates for three NGA architectures (FTTH/P 2 P, FTTH/PON and FTTC). We considered double and triple play service packages and ran sensitivities on data usage. In addition, we calculated termination cost for three different demarcation point locations in the case of FTTH/PON.

40|$|We examine two {{widely used}} {{treatment}} strategies for African animal trypanosomosis in West Africa: preventive drug <b>control</b> <b>ex-ante</b> trypanosomosis infection and curative drug control ex-post trypanosomosis infection. We investigate which {{combination of these}} alternative strategies is economically optimal for cattle farmers. We apply a dynamic optimisation framework to consider both the negative externality of drug resistance development and human behaviour. We develop a bio-economic model to simulate the economic consequences of treatment strategies in a dynamic scenario {{that takes into account}} the interactions among the vector, host and livestock farmers. This model allows for the evolution of drug-resistant trypanosomes through trypanocide misuse and simulates the observed behaviours of cattle farmers based on the elicited risk and time preferences of a sample of 202 cattle farmers in Mali and Burkina Faso. The results show that the private optimal mix of treatment strategies for a risk averse and patient farmer involves preventive treatment for susceptible cattle, supported by a small number of curative treatments for infected cattle. Compared with the treatment strategies observed in the field, this optimal mix of treatment strategies would save approximately 5 % of the annual income of a livestock farmer in the study area and would reduce the prevalence of trypanosomosis. In addition, we demonstrate that a reduction in a farmer's risk aversion is associated with higher treatment rates that can avoid additional losses. By contrast, a decrease in a farmer's patience is related to lower treatment rates that thwart additional benefits. Our results suggest that individual risk and time preferences need to be considered in the development process of disease control interventions. Peer Revie...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} aims at {{studying the}} fundamental challenges that shape {{the very essence}} of the European Merger Control System. In this respect, the core of the thesis relates to the rationale behind enacting a merger control mechanism in the European legal system and the goals that it is meant to achieve. While investigating these issues, the contribution’s recurrent theme gravitates around concepts such as legal certainty, effectiveness and welfare enhancement, principles which are acknowledged to be essential to the generic functioning and development of the European construction and, more particularly, to the appropriate operation of the competition and merger control policies. We have argued that the European Merger Control System embodies a dual purpose: attaining consumer and societal welfare. One has to go beyond assessing the anti-competitive effects that a merger might induce and investigate the different economy-wide effects that concentration transactions and policy approaches may have. Still, the Commission’s practice to date reveals no clear inclination to take societal welfare considerations into account while appraising concentration transactions, thus emphasizing certain conflicts between the goals set by the Treaties and the means used to achieve them. We have debated on which of the two possible methods of assessment, ex-ante or ex-post merger control serves the purpose of attaining consumer and societal welfare best. We concluded that the <b>ex-ante</b> method of <b>control</b> seems more appropriate for fulfilling the societal welfare goal and the ex-post method of control does better when talking about consumer welfare. In the current setup, the ex-ante method may be flawed, due to the limited capacity of grasping the future outlook of essential elements of the market dynamics, the uncertainty which surrounds the concept of standard of proof, the limited possibility of predicting corporate and competitive strategies, the use of assumptions and template test which base their findings on previous market behavioural patterns. The ex-ante method is designed to attain societal welfare; however, we may suggest that it may miss certain essential elements necessary for fulfilling the consumer welfare goal. These elements and features may be provided under an ex-post scheme. We proposed that a reconstruction of the merger control system would seem necessary. On conceptual grounds, we suggested a clear acknowledgment of the societal welfare goal in the Merger Control Regulation’s text and in the Commission’s appraisal process. We proposed a departure from the current approach of sole hard core (a priori) prevention towards a more complex construction entailing lighter ex-ante scrutiny combined with consistent ex-post monitoring. We consider that by contemplating the proposed reforms aimed at a better use of the direct effect concept, private enforcement and consistent efficiency review in an ex-post judiciary setting, the system would be more susceptible to appropriately test the attainment of its goals. Also, a proper concentration transaction follow-up procedure would alleviate the ‘legal certainty realization’ critique and the current system’s inherent prediction shortcomings would be resolved. Thus, the merger control would contribute in a more active and effective manner to the expansion of the European construction...|$|R
