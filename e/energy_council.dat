5|$|In 2000, the United Nations Development Programme, UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, and World <b>Energy</b> <b>Council</b> {{published}} {{an estimate of}} the potential solar energy that could be used by humans each year that took into account factors such as insolation, cloud cover, and the land that is usable by humans. The estimate found that solar energy has a global potential of 1,575–49,837EJ per year (see table below).|$|E
5|$|Hydropower is {{the most}} used form of {{renewable}} energy in Russia, and there is large potential in Russia for more use of hydropower. Russia has 102 hydropower plants with capacities of over 100MW, making it fifth {{in the world for}} hydropower production. It is also second in the world for hydro potential, yet only 20% of this potential is developed. Russia is home to 9% of the world's hydro resources, mostly in Siberia and the country's far east. At the end of 2005, the generating capacity from hydroelectric sources in Russia was 45,700MW, and an additional 5,648MW was under construction. The World <b>Energy</b> <b>Council</b> believes that Russia has much potential for using its hydro resources, with a theoretical potential of about 2,295TWh/yr, with 852TWh being economically feasible.|$|E
5|$|The {{wind power}} {{industry}} set new records in 2014 – more than 50 GW of new capacity was installed. Another record breaking year occurred in 2015, with 22% annual market growth {{resulting in the}} 60 GW mark being passed. In 2015, close to half of all new wind power was added outside of the traditional markets in Europe and North America. This was largely from new construction in China and India. Global Wind <b>Energy</b> <b>Council</b> (GWEC) figures show that 2015 recorded an increase of installed capacity of more than 63 GW, taking the total installed wind energy capacity to 432.9 GW, up from 74 GW in 2006. In terms of economic value, the wind energy sector {{has become one of}} the important players in the energy markets, with the total investments reaching bn (bn), an increase of 4% over 2014.|$|E

Erected in November 1987 by the then State Electricity Commission of Victoria and the Victorian Solar <b>Energy</b> <b>Council</b> (now Energy Victoria) as a demonstration, it was sold in 1994 to the Alternative Technology Association of Melbourne. Electricity production ceased at 1200hrs on 17 May 2003 due to an electrical generator burn-out, caused by moisture, salt, and electrical flash-over. The wind generator remains in place today intact.|$|E
25|$|Oil {{industry}} advocates {{claim that}} by 2015 the Barnett Shale {{may be responsible}} for more than 108,000 jobs. Critics say that tax revenues may be offset by cleanup costs for toxic byproducts of gas drilling, such as benzene and naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM). Environmental groups have pressured state regulators to begin forcing cleanups. The San Juan Citizens Alliance has sued to force the EPA to tighten regulations. Ed Ireland, of the Barnett Shale <b>Energy</b> <b>Council</b> (an industry advocacy group) has said that he believes regulation will increase under the Obama administration; as of 2012, this has not been the case.|$|E
25|$|In July 2005, as {{a result}} of the high {{international}} oil prices, the government created the National Emergency Committee to Address High Oil Prices in an attempt to analyze and promote measures to minimize impacts. This Committee promoted certain specific actions such as the spreading out working schedules to reduce vehicle traffic. Less than one year after the creation of the Committee, the necessity to broaden its scope of action was acknowledged, which led to the creation, in July 2006, of the National <b>Energy</b> <b>Council</b> (CNE). The CNE will propose, manage and contribute to the agencies in charge of approving energy strategies that participate in the country’s socio-economic development in harmony with the environment.|$|E

25|$|The {{theoretical}} maximum {{efficiency of}} any type of power generation system is never reached in practice, {{and it does not}} consider other steps in power generation, such as production, transportation and storage of fuel and conversion of the electricity into mechanical power. However, this calculation allows the comparison of different types of power generation. The maximum theoretical energy efficiency of a fuel cell is 83%, operating at low power density and using pure hydrogen and oxygen as reactants (assuming no heat recapture) According to the World <b>Energy</b> <b>Council,</b> this compares with a maximum theoretical efficiency of 58% for internal combustion engines. While these efficiencies are not approached in most real world applications, high-temperature fuel cells (solid oxide fuel cells or molten carbonate fuel cells) can theoretically be combined with gas turbines to allow stationary fuel cells to come closer to the theoretical limit. A gas turbine would capture heat from the fuel cell and turn it into mechanical energy to increase the fuel cell's operational efficiency. This solution has been predicted to increase total efficiency to as much as 80%.|$|E
