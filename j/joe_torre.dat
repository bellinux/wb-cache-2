5|$|Once the 1999 season started, {{a moment}} of peace {{occurred}} between the fans. Yankees manager <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre</b> returned to Fenway Park for his first game following a battle with prostate cancer.

Yankee manager <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre,</b> manager for the American League team, replaced starting shortstop Nomar Garciaparra of the Red Sox with Derek Jeter.

5|$|From 1974 until 1995, no Yankee {{managerial}} term lasted as long {{as three}} complete seasons. <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre</b> managed the Yankees from 1996 through 2007 and the team made the playoffs each season. He also won six American League championships and four World Series titles. His 1,173 regular season wins are second all-time among Yankees managers. He also has the most playoff appearances, playoff wins and playoff losses of any Yankee manager. Torre was named American League Manager of the Year twice, in 1996 and 1998. His predecessor, Buck Showalter, also was named Manager of the Year in 1994. Torre left after the 2007 season {{and was replaced by}} Joe Girardi, who managed the Yankees from 2008 to 2017 winning one American League championship and one World Series title.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, {{the team}} moved from Milwaukee {{to its current}} location, Atlanta. Its first manager in Atlanta was Bobby Bragan, who managed the team for three seasons earlier in Milwaukee. Lum Harris was the first manager to have managed the team in Atlanta {{for more than four}} seasons. Harris led the team into the NL Championship Series (NLCS) in 1969, but failed to advance into the World Series. <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre</b> was the next manager to manage the Braves into the postseason, but like Harris, led the team into the NLCS with a losing result. Bobby Cox was the manager of the Braves from 1990 till 2010. Under his {{leadership}} the Braves made the postseason 15 times, winning five National League championships and one World Series title in 1995. Cox has the most regular season wins, regular season losses, postseason appearances, postseason wins and postseason losses of any Braves manager. He was named NL Manager of the Year three times, in 1991, 2004 and 2005.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} season as a {{full-time}} MLB umpire, West umpired the game in which Willie McCovey hit his 500th career home run. In the same year, he was at first base when Pete Rose tied the NL record for most consecutive games with a hit, {{and he was the}} home plate umpire when Rose broke it the following day. In 1981, West worked first base for Nolan Ryan’s fifth career no-hitter. On October 13, 1981, West was 28 when he became the youngest NL umpire to call an LCS. In 1983, West was suspended for three days and fined US$500 after a shoving incident with Atlanta Braves manager <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre.</b> The manager became angry {{at the end of a}} game and followed West into the walkway outside the umpires dressing room. West then shoved Torre. On appeal, NL President Chub Feeney reduced West's fine to $300. Torre also received a fine stemming from the incident.|$|E
50|$|After {{his playing}} career ended, Maxvill {{served as a}} coach with the A's, Cardinals, New York Mets and Atlanta Braves (where he served on <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre's</b> staff). After the 1984 season, he became {{general manager of the}} Cardinals, {{spending}} a decade as the Cardinals' top baseball executive, and the team won two more National League pennants in 1985 and 1987.|$|R
50|$|Guidry joined Yankee's Manager <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre's</b> {{coaching}} staff as pitching {{coach in the}} 2006 season, replacing Mel Stottlemyre.

5|$|Impressed by Rivera's pitching, Yankees {{management}} {{chose not}} to re-sign Wetteland in the offseason, opting instead to replace him as closer with Rivera. In April 1997, MLB retired the uniform number 42 league-wide to honor Jackie Robinson for breaking the baseball color line, although Rivera was among a dozen players allowed to continue wearing the number per a grandfather clause. Rivera's transition from setup man to closer in 1997 was not seamless; he blew three of his first six save opportunities and indicated that he was initially uncomfortable in the role. With reassurance from manager <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre,</b> Rivera settled into the ninth-inning role, and he earned his first All-Star selection with 27saves and a 1.96ERA at the midseason break. In the 1997 All-Star Game, he pitched a perfect ninth inning to collect his first save in an All-Star Game. That summer, he added a cut fastball to his pitching repertoire after accidentally discovering how to throw the pitch. Rivera finished the regular season with 43saves in 52opportunities with a 1.88ERA. His first year as closer ended with a blown save in Game 4 of the 1997 AL Division Series against the Cleveland Indians; with the Yankees four outs from advancing to {{the next round of}} the postseason, Rivera allowed a game-tying home run to Sandy Alomar Jr. The Yankees eventually lost that game and the next, eliminating them from the postseason.|$|E
5|$|With his {{contract}} set to expire after the 2007 season, Rivera sought an extension with the Yankees during spring training. Team management refused to negotiate near {{the start of}} the season, prompting him to respond that he would consider free agency {{at the end of the}} year. In April, Rivera blew his first two save opportunities, compiled two losses, and surrendered nine earned runs in innings pitched. Concerned sportswriters attributed his struggles to infrequent use, as the Yankees presented him with few situations to enter a game. Rivera saved 30 of his next 32opportunities and posted a 2.26ERA over the final five months of the season. In addition, he passed John Franco for third place on the all-time saves list with his 425th career save. Still, Rivera finished 2007 with closer career worsts in earned runs (25), hits (68), and ERA (3.15), and his 30saves in 34opportunities were his second-lowest total since 1997. After the Yankees were eliminated from the playoffs in the opening round, Rivera stated his intentions to test the free agent market. He initially indicated that his decision of where to sign would be influenced by whether long-time manager <b>Joe</b> <b>Torre</b> was re-signed. Although Torre did not return, Rivera remained with the Yankees by agreeing to a three-year, $45million contract, making him the highest-paid reliever in baseball history.|$|E
