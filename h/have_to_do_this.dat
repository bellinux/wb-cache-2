500|$|Following the {{box office}} success of J. J. Abrams' Star Trek reboot and the {{announcement}} that actors Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto had tentatively agreed to appear in two sequels, Internet rumors began circulating about {{the plot of the}} second film. Abrams hinted that because of the alternate timeline created in the first film, reintroducing Khan into Star Trek lore remained a possibility. Abrams told MTV, [...] " [...] exist—and while their history may not be exactly as people are familiar with, I would argue that a person's character is what it is," [...] Abrams said of the notion that his Khan could be just as evil, even if Kirk never stranded him on Ceti Alpha V. [...] "Certain people are destined to cross paths and come together, and Khan is out there... even if he doesn't have the same issues." [...] Writer Damon Lindelof declared that Khan's [...] "intense gravity," [...] particularly regarding the character's delivery of monologues, made him an obligatory character to use, even if its iconic status made the crew afraid of the fan reaction. Lindelof jokingly stated that [...] "it was never really a 'Should we or shouldn't we?' as much as it was 'We really <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> but if we don't get it right people are going to kill us.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{concern with}} {{language}} {{was central to}} Kraus's outlook, and he viewed his contemporaries' careless use of language as symptomatic of their careless treatment of the world. Viennese composer Ernst Krenek described meeting the writer in 1932: [...] "At {{a time when people}} were generally decrying the Japanese bombardment of Shanghai, I met Karl Kraus struggling over one of his famous comma problems. He said something like: 'I know that everything is futile when the house is burning. But I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> {{as long as it is}} at all possible; for if those who were supposed to look after commas had always made sure they were in the right place, Shanghai would not be burning'." ...|$|E

2500|$|A few {{stories have}} surfaced. About {{to lead his}} men into action, Niven eased their {{nervousness}} by telling them, [...] "Look, you chaps only <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> once. But I'll {{have to do it}} all over again in Hollywood with Errol Flynn!" [...] Asked by suspicious American sentries during the Battle of the Bulge who had won the World Series in 1943, he answered, [...] "Haven't the foggiest idea, but I did co-star with Ginger Rogers in Bachelor Mother!" [...] On another occasion, asked how he felt about serving with the British Army in Europe, he allegedly said, [...] "Well on the whole, I would rather be tickling Ginger Rogers' tits." ...|$|E
2500|$|Novelist Joanna Trollope commented in The Times that, [...] "This is not {{a matter}} of that age-old - and {{impossible}} - difficulty of the plagiarism of ideas. It is something much easier to define, and a danger to all writers. It is - let's not mince our words - the theft of someone's writing, someone's own words stolen in exactly the form in which their brain produced them. And it's a theft to which all writers are vulnerable. Jo Rowling didn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this.</b> I should think that her time in New York was horrible, exacerbated by a lack of support caused, no doubt, by deeply unattractive sourness over her wealth. Well, I applaud her, and I bet I'm not alone. I am thrilled for her, and very grateful to her, for taking the stand she did - and winning." ...|$|E

60|$|Both {{looked around}} for several minutes and then decided to cross a rocky stretch to the right. They <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> with great care, as the road was full of sink holes and crevices, and they <b>did</b> not want <b>to</b> break a leg or have the horse injured.|$|R

"Well, lads," [...] said Redhand, [...] "it's {{evident that}} we can't drink it just now, for it would {{unsteady}} our hands {{for the work}} we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> night.

60|$|We have to {{discourage}} the cheap tricks of controversy, the retort, the search for inconsistency.

6000|$|Mr. Peters had {{a bomb in}} his hand, {{which he}} was fondling with loving care. He {{explained}} to Baxter that he had stolen it from the Earl of Emsworth's museum.

They'll all have to go abroad,--that'll be the end of it. There's been such a scene between the earl and George. George lost his temper and told the earl that Porlock's marriage was his fault.

6000|$|... 'You must go in there, and {{you shall}} go in there,' said the little man, {{and with that}} he lifted him up on to the window-sill.

The lid opens to the right, and she comes out to the left. When she has {{got out of the}} chest and passed over you, you must get into it and lie there, and that in a hurry, without her seeing you. There you must remain lying until day dawns, and whether she threatens you or entreats you, you must not come out of it, or give her any answer.

6000|$|... "But love, my Lord, {{may be a}} great misfortune." [...] As he {{said this}} {{the tone of his}} voice was altered, and there was a melancholy solemnity not only in his words but in his countenance. [...] "I take it that young people when they love rarely think of more than the present moment. If they did so the bloom would be gone from their romance. But others <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> for them. If Isabel had come to me saying that she loved a poor man, there would not have been much to disquiet me. A poor man may earn bread for himself and his wife, and if he failed I could have found them bread. Nor, had she loved {{somewhat}} below her own degree, should I have opposed her. So long as her husband had been an educated man, there might have been no future punishment to fear." ...|$|E

Her purity shall be dishonoured, her love betrayed, her life reduced to such chaos that she shall cease to believe even in her God, and in return for these things I will give her--you. Your new plaything shall pass through my mill, George Caresfoot, before ever she comes to yours; and on her I will repay with interest all that I have suffered at your hands;" [...] and, exhausted with the fierceness of her own invective and the violence of conflicting passions, she sank back into her chair.|$|E
6000|$|Hawarden Castle, Sept. 28, 1881.—I {{thank you}} for the very clear [...] and careful account of the {{proposed}} proceedings at Leeds.

I see no difficulty but [...] one—a procession through the principal thoroughfares is one of the [...] most exhausting processes I know as a preliminary to addressing [...] a mass meeting. A mass meeting requires the physical powers to be [...] in their best and freshest state, as far as anything can be fresh [...] in a man near seventy-two; and I have on one or more former [...] occasions felt them wofully contracted. In Midlothian I never had [...] anything of the kind before a great physical effort in speaking; [...] and the lapse even of a couple of years is something. It would [...] certainly be most desirable to have the mass meeting first, and [...] then I have not any fear at all of the procession through whatever [...] thoroughfares you think fit.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile my {{duty was}} not to {{speculate}} on the dreams and mental attitudes of others, but like a practical hunter and trader, to carry to a successful issue an expedition that I was well paid to manage, and to dig up a certain rare flower root, if I could find it, in the marketable value of which I had an interest. I have always prided myself upon my entire lack of imagination and all such mental phantasies, and upon an aptitude for hard business and {{an appreciation of the}} facts of life, that after all are the things with which we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>This</b> is the truth; at least, I hope it is. For if I were to be quite honest, which no one ever has been, except a gentleman named Mr. Pepys, who, I think, lived in the reign of Charles II, and who, to judge from his memoirs, which I have read lately, did not write for publication, I should have to admit that there is another side to my nature. I sternly suppress it, however, at any rate for the present.|$|E
