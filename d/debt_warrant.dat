The sample includes public equity, private equity, rights offerings, straight <b>debt,</b> <b>warrant</b> debt and convertible debt issues. Contrary to the U. S., {{the announcement of}} convertible debt issues {{is accompanied by a}} significant positive abnormal return of 1. 05 %. The announcement of equity issues has a positive abnormal return of 0. 45 %, significant at the 0. 10 level, but this positive abnormal return can be attributed to one year in our sample and is offset by a negative issue date abnormal return of - 1. 01 %. The abnormal returns are negatively related to firm size, so that for equity issues (but not for convertible debt issues), large Japanese firms have significant negative announcement abnormal returns. Our evidence is consistent with the view that Japanese managers decide to issue shares based on different considerations than American managers. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{stance of}} fiscal policy in CEMAC and WAEMU is {{strongly}} influenced by fiscal effort in the previous period. This persistence underscores the risks of a procyclical fiscal policy stance, given these countries'' high degree of dependence on primary commodities and exposure to terms of trade shocks. This paper finds that the coefficient of the lagged debt stock was significant and positive, consistent with the theory that higher levels of <b>debt</b> <b>warrant</b> greater fiscal effort. Various measures of economic performance, as captured by economic growth and per capita GDP, openness, and the terms of trade were also found to be important factors in explaining fiscal performance. As fiscal performance seems to be strongly affected by both real GDP growth and terms of trade fluctuations, {{there appears to be}} a need to develop supplementary fiscal-related criteria that take into account the influence of output and the terms of trade.

In a model where a venture capitalist provides staged financing for a project, we illustrate an advantage of convertible <b>debt</b> (or <b>warrants)</b> over a mixture of debt and equity. Essentially, when the venture capitalist retains the option to abandon the project, the entrepreneur has an incentive to engage in window dressing and bias positively the short-term performance of the project, reducing the probability {{that it will be}} liquidated. An appropriately designed convertible security prevents such behavior because window dressing also increases the probability that the venture capitalist will exercise the conversion option becoming the owner of a substantial fraction of the project’s equity...|$|R

Second, we show for the first time in the option literature, that instantaneous equity volatility is a solution of a partial differential equation similar to Black-Scholes', although it is non-linear and in general does not have any analytical solution. However, analytical approximations for equity volatility are proposed for different capital structures: (1) equity and debt, (2) equity and warrants, and (3) equity, <b>debt</b> and <b>warrants.</b> They are shown to be very accurate. corporate finance, financial structure, leverage effect, option pricing, security valuation, stochastic, volatility, warrants, numerical methods,...|$|R

5000|$|In its {{simplest}} form, a capitalization table, or [...] "cap table" [...] as it {{is often}} abbreviated, is a ledger that tracks the equity ownership of a company's shareholders. However, the term can refer {{to the way in}} which any company keeps track of all of the relevant information related to all of its stakeholders (including debt, convertible <b>debt,</b> option, <b>warrant,</b> and derivatives holders) and their claims on the company. [...] Public companies primarily use transfer agents and a wide array of technologies and systems to keep track of their stakeholder information and therefore it is uncommon for public companies to refer to their stakeholder records and accounting as a [...] "cap table." [...] Private companies typically have a much simpler capital structure and more limited stakeholder accounting requirements. In the earliest stages of their development, private companies may track their shareholders in a simple document or spreadsheet. Cap tables are widely used by entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and investment bankers to model and to analyze events such as ownership dilution, issuing employee stock options, or issuing new securities. After several rounds of financing, a cap table can become highly complex.|$|R
40|$|Attaching a call {{feature to}} new debt {{for any reason}} was the norm {{for most of the}} twentieth century. For example, the {{majority}} of new bonds issued prior to 1986 contain a call provision. But over the past ten years, we observe that the number of call options on new debt is now a minority component. The intent {{of this study is to}} reproduce the work of Kish and Livingston (1992) for the period 1987 - 1996. The major structural change that occurred in the <b>debt</b> market <b>warrants</b> the reproduction of this study for the recent decade. For the 1977 - 1986 period, the ratio of callable to non-callable bonds is approximately 4 : 1, whereas the ratio during the 1987 - 1996 period approximates 0. 5 : 1. A natural question arises as to why we have observed such a phenomenon in the financial world. Reproducing the study in the same manner offers insight into the reasoning behind a firm’s decision to use a call feature on newly issued debt. Our empirical results indicate that the values that were important for the firm’s decision making process (the level of interest rates, the debt rating, the probability of default, the number of years to maturity and the firm classification) are still valid in the latter time period tested. Of particular note, we found that the transfer of wealth externality issue as measured by our proxy, GROWTH, impacts the call option decision in the latter decade and not the former decade...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} {{recent developments in}} bank regulation are based on capital requirements. For example, the Basle Accord of 1988 specifies that bank capital {{must be at least}} 8 percent of a bank’s risk-weighted assets. 1 Also, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) requires regulators to shut down a bank whose capital has dropped below a cutoff level. While these regulations are important, their focus is too narrow in that they concentrate solely on equity. There are other types of financial instruments available, and these can be even more effective than capital requirements at controlling risk. Proposals to require banks to issue subordinated debt recognize this, but even those proposals do not make full use of the possibilities available. This article argues that capital regulation can be improved by using financial instruments like convertible <b>debt</b> and <b>warrants</b> with high strike prices. Furthermore, some of the improvement brought about by these instruments would allow a reduction in the traditional capital requirements. Any economic study of bank capital regulation requires a theory of capital structure. Modern theories of corporate financial structure start with the celebrated result of Modigliani and Miller (1958) : that in a world without taxes or bankruptcy costs, the value of a firm does not depend on its capital structure. These theories then consider departures from the world of Modigliani and Miller—departures that cause the capital structure to matter. The particular departure studied in this article is agency theory. In the agency theory of capital structure, limited liability creates an incentive for highly leveraged firms to take excessive risk. These incentives are made worse in banking becaus...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – To {{contrast}} the different {{factors that can}} determine the level of debt of firms by means of panel data methodology. Design/methodology/approach – The variables {{used in the study}} are: size, generated resources, level of <b>warrants,</b> <b>debt</b> cost, growth opportunities, and reputation. Six hypotheses are considered. Findings – The results obtained suggest that the stated variables, other than reputation, can be considered to be explanatory variables of firm debt level. Using within-groups estimation and generalized least squares, the results suggest that the behavior of the sample throughout the study period is consistent with the fixed effects approach, in which the specific characteristics of each firm remain constant throughout time. Moreover, with respect to the six considered hypotheses, the analysis shows the influence of all stated variables except reputation on the leverage. Originality/value – Adds to the body of research that has focused on the analysis of the financial decisions of the firm, with the level of debt appearing as a relevant factor in explaining the relationship between investment and financing decisions.

40|$|An {{enterprise}} having {{investments in}} the common stock of other enterprises issues debt securities that permit the holder to acquire a fixed number of shares of such common stock. Those transactions are commonly effected through the sale of either debt with detachable "warrants" that can be exchanged for the stock investment or <b>debt</b> without detachable <b>warrants</b> (the <b>debt</b> itself must be exchanged for the stock investment—referred to as "exchangeable " debentures). Those debt issues differ from traditional warrants or convertible instruments because the traditional instruments involve exchanges for the equity securities of the issuer. The issues are: 1. Whether the warrant amount should be amortized over its term, or {{whether it should be}} eliminated by a credit to income only when the warrant is exercised or expired 2. Whether the exchangeable debt should be treated similar to traditional convertibles as specified in Opinion 14, or whether it more closely resembles the warrant transaction, thereby requiring separate accounting for the exchangeability feature.

40|$|This article {{provides}} a survey on term structure models designed for pricing {{fixed income securities}} and their derivatives. 1 The past several decades have witnessed a rapid development in the fixed-income markets. A number of new fixed-income instruments have been introduced successfully into the financial market. These include, to mention just a few, strips, <b>debt</b> <b>warrants,</b> put bonds, commercial mortgage-backed securities, payment-in-kind debentures, zero-coupon convertibles, interest rate futures and options, credit default swaps, and swaptions. The size of the fixed-income market has greatly expanded. The total value of the fixed-income assets is {{about two-thirds of the}} market value of all outstanding securities. 2 From the investment perspective, {{it is important to understand}} how fixed-income securities are priced. The term structure of interest rates plays a key role in pricing fixed income securities. Not surprisingly, a vast literature has been devoted to understanding the stochastic behavior of term structure of interest rate, the pricing mechanism of fixed-income markets, and the spread between different fixed-income securities. Past research generally focuses on: (i) modeling the term structure of interest rates and yield spreads; (ii) providing empirical evidence; and (iii) applying the theory to the pricing of fixed-income instruments and risk management. As such, our review centers on alternative models of term structure of interest rates, their tractability, empirical performance, and applications. We begin with the basic definitions and notations in Section 1. We provide clear concepts of term structure of interest rates that are easily misunderstood. Section 2 introduces bond pricing theory within the dynamic term structure model (DTSM) framework. This framework provides a general modeling structure in which most of the popular term structure models are nested. This discussion thus helps understand the primary ingredients to categorize different DTSMs, i. e., the risk-neutral distribution of the state variables and the mapping function between these state variables and instantaneous interest rate. Sections 3 provides a literature review of the studies on default free bonds. Several widely used continuous-time DTSMs are reviewed here, including affine, quadratic, regime switching, jump-diffusion and stochastic volatility models. We conclude this section with a discussion of empirical performance of these DTSMs, where we discuss some open issues, including the expectation puzzle, the linearity of state variables, the advantages of multifactor and nonlinear models, and their implications for pricing and risk management. The studies of defaultable bonds are explored in section 4. We review both structural and reduced-form models, with particular attention given to the later. Several important issues in reduced form models are addressed here, including the specification of recovery rates, default intensity, coupon payment, other factors such as liquidity and taxes, and correlated defaults. Since it is convenient to have a closed-form pricing formula, it is important to evaluate the tradeoff between analytical tractability and the model complexity. Major empirical issues are related touncovering the components of yield spreads and answering the question whether the factors are latent or observable. Section 5 reviews the studies on two popular interest rate derivatives: interest rate swap and credit default swap. Here we present the pricing formulas of interest rate swap and credit default swap based on risk-neutral pricing theory. Other risk factors, such as counterparty risk and liquidity risk are then introduced into the pricing formula. Following this, we review important empirical work on the determinants of interest rate swap spread and credit default swap spread. Section 6 concludes the paper by providing a summary of the literature and directions for future research. These include: (i) the economic significance of DTSM specification on pricing and risk management; (ii) the difference of interest rate dynamics in the risk neutral measure and physical measure; (iii) the decomposition of yield spreads; and (iv) the pricing of credit risk with correlated factors.

30|$|This study employs {{market to}} book ratio to measure growth opportunities. Jensen (1986) argues that if firms possess high growth opportunities, they can {{mitigate}} the agency {{costs associated with}} free cash flow thus reducing their dependence on debt. In this way, the disciplinary role of debt can be reduced. Due to higher growth opportunities, firms may invest in innovative and riskier projects that will increase their cost of debt, and thus, investment in risky projects may lead to an asset substitution problem. Thus, firms are more attracted to internal financing or equity financing in case of high growth opportunities. Debt servicing associated with <b>debt</b> financing may <b>warrant</b> additional risk that makes debt more vulnerable. Thus, a lower leverage is expected for firms having high market to book ratio. This negative relationship is further confirmed by Wiwattanakantang (1999) and Kayo and Kimura (2011) who based their discussion on trade-off and agency cost theories. On the other hand, Chen (2004) found {{a positive relationship between}} growth opportunities and leverage for Chinese firms. Thus, the relationship between leverage and growth opportunities is unclear and it can be both ways.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} general {{framework}} {{to assess the}} value of the financial claims issued by the firm, European equity options and warrantsin terms of the stock price. In our framework, the firm's asset is assumed to follow a standard stationary lognormal process with constant volatility. However, it is not the case for equity volatility. The stochastic nature of equity volatility is endogenous, and comes from the impact of a change in {{the value of the}} firm's assets on the financial leverage. In a previous paper we studied the stochastic process for equity volatility, and proposed analytic approximations for different capital structures. In this companion paper we derive analytic approximations for the value of European equity options and warrants for a firm financed by equity, <b>debt</b> and <b>warrants.</b> We first present the basic model, which is an extension of the Black-Scholes model, to value corporate securities either as a function of the stock price, or as a function of the firm's total assets. Since stock prices are observable, then for practical purposes, traders prefer to use the stock as the underlying instrument, we concentrate on valuation models in terms of the stock price. Second, we derive an exact solution for the valuation in terms of the stock price of (i) a European call option on the stock of a levered firm, i. e. a European compound call option on the total assets of the firm, (ii) an equity warrant for an all-equity firm, and (iii) an equity warrant for a firm financed by equity and debt. Unfortunately, to compute these solutions we need to specify the function of the stock price in terms of the firm's assets value. In general we are unable to specify this expression, but we propose tight bounds for the value of these options which can be easily computed as a function of the stock price. Our results provide useful extensions of the Black-Scholes model. corporate finance, financial structure, leverage effect, option pricing, security valuation, stochastic volatility, warrants, numerical methods,...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the roles}} of <b>debt,</b> equity and <b>warrants</b> under asymmetric information and provides two rationales for the issuance of combinations of debt and equity {{as well as for}} the use of warrants. Two cases are considered: i) pure adverse selection and ii) adverse selection cum moral hazard. In the former case, a combination of securities is only used to convey socially costless information about the type of the project. In the latter case, in addition to transmitting information, the securities issued are the means of providing the appropriate effort incentives. Because of this second role, the introduction of moral hazard into an adverse selection framework has significant effects both on the combinations of securities issued in equilibrium and their pricing. Under pure adverse selection, the use of warrants, through the appropriate choice of their exercise price, allows us to obtain equilibria (pooling or separating) where the securities issued are fairly priced even if this is not possible when we restrict ourselves to debt, equity and convertible debt. In the adverse selection cum moral hazard case, employing a debt-warrant combination, we can implement the (constrained) efficient outcome under weaker restrictions on the parameter values than a debt-equity combination and, in some cases, under the same conditions as the social planner...|$|R
40|$|The term “corporate raiders” {{previously}} struck fear in {{the hearts}} of corporate boards and management teams. It generally refers to investors who target undervalued, cash-flush or mismanaged companies and initiate a hostile takeover of the company. Corporate raiders earned their name in part because of their focus on value extraction, which could entail dismantling a company and selling off its crown jewels. Today, the term often conjures up images of Michael Milken, Henry Kravis or the movie character Gordon Gekko, but the alleged threat posed to companies by corporate raiders is less prevalent—at least with respect to the traditional use of equity to facilitate a hostile takeover. The growing use of debt rather than equity to cause a change of control at target companies raises new concerns for corporate boards and management teams and new policy considerations for commentators and legislators. Are activist debtholders who employ this investment strategy akin to the corporate raiders of the past? This Article explores these issues by, among other things, presenting in-depth case studies and critically evaluating the value implications of traditional takeover activity and regulation. It compares and contrasts the use of equity and debt in control contests and identifies similarities that suggest some regulation of strategic <b>debt</b> acquisitions is <b>warranted.</b> The Article proposes a proactive approach that better equips corporate boards and management teams to negotiate with activist debtholders while preserving investment opportunities for debtholders and the governance efficiencies that often flow from activism for the corporate target’s other stakeholders...|$|R
