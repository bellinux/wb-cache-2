5|$|After {{four and}} a half months of {{research}} in Spain, Littleton visited the site of his war-time service in Naples. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> find seven small glass factories there. On a later visit to the island of Murano, he visited more than fifty glass factories. He was fascinated by the little demonstration furnaces that some of the factories placed outside their walls. The furnaces would be staffed by a couple of the factory's glassblowers, who would perform their craft for tourists. His meeting with Sala and his Murano experiences stimulated his interest in making glass art in a private studio.|$|E

In 1913, having been dropped by England four years earlier, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> be called up again to play Scotland on 15 March at Twickenham. Tarr was not at his best and it was to be his last international appearance. England, meanwhile, only managed a 3–0 victory, but it was enough to regain the Calcutta Cup and earn its first Grand Slam.|$|E
5|$|In the off-season, Malhotra {{was drafted}} by the New York Rangers in the first round, seventh overall, of the 1998 NHL Entry Draft.

That same year, he filed a $3million lawsuit against the producers of the 2010 direct-to-DVD film Camp Hell, claiming exploitation. According to the lawsuit, Eisenberg agreed {{to appear in the}} film as a favor to his friends. He was on set for one day of filming in 2007, earned about $3,000, and logged only a few minutes of total screentime. Because of his minimal involvement in the production, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> see that his face was prominently featured {{on the cover of the}} DVD, implying that he starred in the film. His lawsuit asserts various California law causes of action, including claims for unfair business practices and publicity rights.|$|E

25|$|G.M.B.

What Dobson describes is essentially the baseline from which the ozone hole is measured: actual ozone hole values are in the 150–100 DU range.|$|E

Bory de St.-Vincent knew Latreille's work, and managed to obtain the release of Latreille and one of his cell-mates. All the other inmates were dead within one month. The beetle had been described by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1775, but recognising it had saved Latreille's life.|$|E

25|$|November 24 was dark, {{with low}} clouds, fog, and drizzling rain.

25|$|At {{first there}} was some {{question}} as to what exactly the new company should do.

When the President in charge of financing traveled to Wall Street to look for seed capital, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> find that Cray's reputation was very well known. Far from struggling for some role to play in the market, the financial world was more than willing to provide Cray with all the money they would need to develop a new machine.|$|E
25|$|The Fender Jazz bass guitar {{started out}} {{life as a}} {{standard}} 4-string bass, but in 1976, after being inspired by Jaco Pastorius' fretless playing, he commissioned a symphony bass repairman {{by the name of}} Neville Whitehead to replace the standard neck with a fretless version. The replacement neck was a planed-down real ebony neck removed from a 100-year-old upright bass. For six months Foster struggled with the pure black neck as there were no indicators for finger positioning. Eventually giving up the fight, he employed luthier Dick Knight to mark fretlines on the neck. After going to this trouble <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> learn that Pastorius achieved the same thing by merely pulling off the frets and filling the resulting holes with epoxy resin. Since the early 80s the bass guitar has undergone several component replacements including the bridge and the pick-ups.|$|E
25|$|Edison's major {{innovation}} was {{the establishment}} of an industrial research lab. It was built in Menlo Park, a part of Raritan Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey (today named Edison in his honor), with the funds from the sale of Edison's quadruplex telegraph. After his demonstration of the telegraph, Edison was not sure that his original plan to sell it for $4,000 to $5,000 was right, so he asked Western Union to make a bid. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> hear them offer $10,000 ($ in today's dollars.), which he gratefully accepted. The quadruplex telegraph was Edison's first big financial success, and Menlo Park became the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement. Edison was legally attributed with most of the inventions produced there, though many employees carried out research and development under his direction. His staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research, and he drove them hard to produce results.|$|E
