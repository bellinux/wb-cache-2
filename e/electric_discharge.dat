5|$|Hydrogen, {{like some}} of the alkali metals, reacts explosively with fluorine. Carbon, as lamp black, reacts at room {{temperature}} to yield fluoromethane. Graphite combines with fluorine above 400°C (750°F) to produce non-stoichiometric carbon monofluoride; higher temperatures generate gaseous fluorocarbons, sometimes with explosions. Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide react at or just above room temperature, whereas paraffins and other organic chemicals generate strong reactions: even fully substituted haloalkanes such as carbon tetrachloride, normally incombustible, may explode. Although nitrogen trifluoride is stable, nitrogen requires an <b>electric</b> <b>discharge</b> at elevated temperatures for reaction with fluorine to occur, due to the very strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen; ammonia may react explosively. Oxygen does not combine with fluorine under ambient conditions, but can be made to react using <b>electric</b> <b>discharge</b> at low temperatures and pressures; the products tend to disintegrate into their constituent elements when heated. Heavier halogens react readily with fluorine as does the noble gas radon; of the other noble gases, only xenon and krypton react, and only under special conditions.|$|E
5|$|Atomic nitrogen, {{also known}} as active nitrogen, is highly reactive, being a triradical with three {{unpaired}} electrons. Free nitrogen atoms easily react with most elements to form nitrides, and even when two free nitrogen atoms collide to produce an excited N2 molecule, they may release so much energy on collision with even such stable molecules as carbon dioxide and water to cause homolytic fission into radicals such as CO and O or OH and H. Atomic nitrogen is prepared by passing an <b>electric</b> <b>discharge</b> through nitrogen gas at 0.1–2mmHg, which produces atomic nitrogen along with a peach-yellow emission that fades slowly as an afterglow for several minutes even after the discharge terminates.|$|E
5|$|Though seldom life-threatening, the <b>electric</b> <b>discharge</b> of an Atlantic torpedo {{is quite}} severe {{and may be}} enough to knock a person unconscious. However, a greater danger to divers is the {{disorientation}} that follows the shock. The Atlantic torpedo is of no commercial value, as its meat is flabby and tasteless. It is caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fisheries in bottom trawls and on hook-and-line. When caught at sea, it is generally discarded or cut up for bait. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) does not yet have enough data to assess the Atlantic torpedo beyond Data Deficient; it could be negatively affected by fishing mortality, though specific data on catch rates and population trends are lacking, {{as well as by}} the degradation of coral reefs that are important to juveniles. Its slow reproductive rate would limit its capacity to recover from population depletion.|$|E

5|$|With ample {{current density}} and ionization, this forms a {{luminous}} electric arc (a continuous <b>electric</b> <b>discharge</b> similar to lightning) between the electrodes. Electrical resistance along the continuous electric arc creates heat, which dissociates more gas molecules and ionizes the resulting atoms (where degree of ionization {{is determined by}} temperature), and as per the sequence: solid-liquid-gas-plasma, the gas is gradually turned into a thermal plasma. A thermal plasma is in thermal equilibrium, {{which is to say}} that the temperature is relatively homogeneous throughout the heavy particles (i.e. atoms, molecules and ions) and electrons. This is so because when thermal plasmas are generated, electrical energy is given to electrons, which, due to their great mobility and large numbers, are able to disperse it rapidly and by elastic collision (without energy loss) to the heavy particles.|$|E

In the ensuing confrontation, Taylor kills Marlow and is herself killed by an <b>electric</b> <b>discharge</b> while Ripley is forced to escape the Anesidora shortly before it explodes. Ricardo tells Ripley that the Anesidora explosion destroyed Sevastopol's orbital stabilisers, causing the station to slowly drift into KG348's atmosphere. Ripley and Ricardo contact the Torrens for extraction, but a facehugger paralyses Ricardo, forcing Ripley to leave him. After making her way outside to help the Torrens detach from the station, Ripley is surrounded by several alien creatures and then thrown into the ship due to a blast. Aboard the Torrens, Ripley discovers that another alien has boarded the ship. Still in her EVA suit, Ripley is cornered in the airlock and left with no option but to open it, which ejects both her and the alien into space. The final shot of the game depicts Ripley adrift and unconscious in her EVA suit, then suddenly awakened by a searchlight that crosses her face.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The <b>electric</b> organ <b>discharge</b> of the gymnoti-form fish Brachyhypopomus pinnicaudatus is a biphasic waveform. The female’s <b>electric</b> organ <b>discharge</b> {{is nearly}} {{symmetric}} but males produce a longer second phase than first phase. In this study, infrared-sensitive video cameras monitored {{the position of}} unrestrained fish, facilitating precise measurement of <b>electric</b> organ <b>discharge</b> duration and amplitude every 2 h for 24 h. Males (n 27) increased <b>electric</b> organ <b>discharge</b> dura-tion by 37 12 % and amplitude by 24 9 % at night and decreased it during the day. In contrast, females (n 8) exhibited only minor <b>electric</b> organ <b>discharge</b> variation over time. Most of a male’s increase occurred rapidly within the first 2 – 3 h of darkness. <b>Electric</b> organ <b>discharge</b> values gradually diminished {{during the second half}} of the dark period and into the next morning. Modulation of the second phase of the biphasic <b>electric</b> organ <b>discharge</b> produced most of the duration change in males, but both phases changed amplitude by similar amounts. Turning the lights o at mid-day triggered an immediate increase in <b>electric</b> organ <b>discharge,</b> suggest-ing modification of existing ion channels in the electric organ, rather than altered genomic expression.

25|$|Plasma {{consists}} of a mixture of electrons, ions, radicals, neutrals and photons. Some of these species are in local thermodynamic equilibrium, while others are not. Even for simple gases like argon this mixture can be complex. For plasmas of organic monomers, the complexity can rapidly increase as some components of the plasma fragment, while others interact and form larger species. Glow discharge is a technique in polymerization which forms free electrons which gain energy from an electric field, and then lose energy through collisions with neutral molecules in the gas phase. This leads to many chemically reactive species, which then lead to a plasma polymerization reaction. The <b>electric</b> <b>discharge</b> process for plasma polymerization is the “low-temperature plasma” method, because higher temperatures cause degradation. These plasmas are formed by a direct current, alternating current or radio frequency generator.|$|E

25|$|The common {{fluorescent}} lamp relies on fluorescence. Inside the glass tube is a partial vacuum {{and a small}} amount of mercury. An <b>electric</b> <b>discharge</b> in the tube causes the mercury atoms to emit mostly ultraviolet light. The tube is lined with a coating of a fluorescent material, called the phosphor, which absorbs the ultraviolet and re-emits visible light. Fluorescent lighting is more energy-efficient than incandescent lighting elements. However, the uneven spectrum of traditional {{fluorescent lamp}}s may cause certain colors to appear different than when illuminated by incandescent light or daylight. The mercury vapor emission spectrum is dominated by a short-wave UV line at 254nm (which provides most of the energy to the phosphors), accompanied by visible light emission at 436nm (blue), 546nm (green) and 579nm (yellow-orange). These three lines can be observed superimposed on the white continuum using a hand spectroscope, for light emitted by the usual white fluorescent tubes. These same visible lines, accompanied by the emission lines of trivalent europium and trivalent terbium, and further accompanied by the emission continuum of divalent europium in the blue region, comprise the more discontinuous light emission of the modern trichromatic phosphor systems used in many compact fluorescent lamp and traditional lamps where better color rendition is a goal.|$|E
25|$|In {{as early}} as the 1870s “{{polymers}}” formed by this process were known, but these polymers were initially thought of as undesirable byproducts associated with <b>electric</b> <b>discharge,</b> with little attention being given to their properties. It was not until the 1960s that the properties of these polymers where found to be useful. It was found that flawless thin polymeric coatings could be formed on metals, although for very thin films (<10mm) this has recently been shown to be an oversimplification. By selecting the monomer type and the energy density per monomer, known as the Yasuda parameter, the chemical composition and structure of the resulting thin film can be varied with a wide range. These films are usually inert, adhesive, and have low dielectric constants. Some common monomers polymerized by this method include styrene, ethylene, methacrylate and pyridine, just to name a few. The 1970s brought about many advances in plasma polymerization, including the polymerization of many different types of monomers. The mechanisms of deposition however were largely ignored until more recently. Since this time most attention devoted to plasma polymerization has been in the fields of coatings, but since it is difficult to control polymer structure, it has limited applications.|$|E
