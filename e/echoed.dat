It received favorable pre-publication reviews and was anticipated as another strong success, reaching the top 10 on Amazon.com before its release and later becoming a bestseller.

5|$|Famitsu {{enjoyed the}} higher speed of battle {{compared}} to Episode I. Parkin <b>echoed</b> these sentiments while also noted how mechanics such as Boost {{and the addition}} of side quest content made the game better than its predecessor. GamePro positively noted that the first game's mechanics had been made more approachable for series newcomers, while Massimilla felt that the simplified nature of the character growth system brought down the experience in addition to being shorter than other RPGs available at the time. Nutt felt that the alterations made battles far more enjoyable despite the character growth system lacking any meaningful customization options. Dunham <b>echoed</b> other reviewers' opinions on both the upgrades to battle and the reworked character progression system, in addition to the lack of in-game currency to buy items.|$|E

5000|$|These {{methods are}} {{commonly}} called acoustic <b>echo</b> suppression (AES) and acoustic <b>echo</b> cancellation (AEC), and more rarely line <b>echo</b> cancellation (LEC). In some cases, these terms are more precise, {{as there are}} various types and causes of <b>echo</b> with unique characteristics, including acoustic <b>echo</b> (sounds from a loudspeaker being reflected and recorded by a microphone, which can vary substantially over time) and line <b>echo</b> (electrical impulses caused by, e.g., coupling between the sending and receiving wires, impedance mismatches, electrical reflections, etc., which varies much less than acoustic <b>echo).</b> In practice, however, the same techniques are used to treat all types of <b>echo,</b> so an acoustic <b>echo</b> canceller can cancel line <b>echo</b> as well as acoustic <b>echo.</b> [...] "AEC" [...] in particular is commonly {{used to refer to}} <b>echo</b> cancelers in general, regardless of whether they were intended for acoustic <b>echo,</b> line <b>echo,</b> or both.|$|R

30|$|The <b>echo</b> {{reflection}} on radar simulator {{can be classified}} into three types (Ji et al. 2015; Zhang 2007). A Type I <b>Echo</b> is the <b>echo</b> reflected by artificial architectures such as berth and breakwater. Type I <b>Echoes</b> have regular shape {{and can be used}} for positioning because of its clear boundaries and fixed position. A Type II <b>Echo</b> is the <b>echo</b> reflected by rocky coast. Type II <b>Echoes</b> have a realistic pattern as well as fixed position. A Type III <b>Echo</b> is an <b>echo</b> reflected by flat coast such as sand coast. Type III <b>Echoes</b> have a large <b>echo</b> reflection zone and relatively weak reflection. Additionally, the shape and position of a Type III <b>Echo</b> will change with the motion of the waves. This study focuses only on simulation of Type II Coastline <b>Echoes</b> because of its natural fractal features. Three different fractal algorithms are adopted to simulate coastline <b>echoes.</b> A comparison among these three simulation algorithms is included.|$|R
40|$|Acoustic <b>echo</b> arises due to {{acoustic}} coupling between the loud-speaker and the microphone of a communication device. Acous-tic <b>echo</b> cancellation and suppression techniques {{are used to}} reduce the acoustic <b>echo.</b> In this work we propose to first cancel the early <b>echo,</b> which {{is related to the}} early part of the <b>echo</b> path, and sub-sequently suppress the late <b>echo,</b> which is related to the later part of the <b>echo</b> path. The identification of the <b>echo</b> path is carried out in the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) domain, where a trade-off is facilitated between distortion of the near-end speech, residual <b>echo,</b> convergence rate, and robustness to <b>echo</b> path changes. Experimen-tal results demonstrate that the system achieves high <b>echo</b> and noise reduction while maintaining low distortion of the near-end speech. In addition, it is shown that the proposed system is more robust to <b>echo</b> path changes compared to an acoustic canceller alone.

40|$|Acoustic <b>echoes</b> arise {{whenever}} there is acoustic coupling between a loudspeaker and a microphone. A traditional solution for eliminating the undesired <b>echo</b> signal is an acoustic <b>echo</b> canceler (AEC), which identifies the <b>echo</b> path between a loudspeaker and a microphone {{by means of}} an adaptive filter. The <b>echo</b> signal can be canceled successfully when the modeling filter approaches the true <b>echo</b> path. Another way to mitigate the <b>echo</b> effect is through <b>echo</b> suppression. Unlike an AEC, an acoustic <b>echo</b> suppressor (AES) achieves <b>echo</b> attenuation by means of spectral modification. In this paper, we propose an AES without a need for the computationally complex task of acoustic <b>echo</b> path estimation. Instead of identifying the <b>echo</b> path impulse response, the proposed method estimates only the properties of the <b>echo</b> path which are needed for effective <b>echo</b> suppression. These are a delay parameter and a filter mimicking the coloration effect of the <b>echo</b> path on the loudspeaker signal. The gain filter for the AES is computed using the estimated delay and coloration effect filter. Simulations and experiments using a real-time telecommunication system indicate that the proposed scheme is effective for suppressing <b>echo,</b> supports duplex communication, and is less sensitive to <b>echo</b> path changes than a conventional AEC. 1...|$|R

40|$|<b>Echo</b> in the {{telephone}} network {{is a well-known}} phenomenon [...] long delays and noticeable <b>echo</b> may create significant or even unbearable disturbance in a telephone conversation. <b>Echo</b> cancellation is a technique to reduce the <b>echo</b> to an acceptable level.

A traditional solution for eliminating the undesired <b>echo</b> signal is an acoustic <b>echo</b> canceler (AEC), which identifies the <b>echo</b> path between a loudspeaker and a microphone {{by means of}} an adaptive filter. The <b>echo</b> signal can be canceled successfully when the modeling filter approaches the true <b>echo</b> path. In practice, however, a modeling filter often differs from the true <b>echo</b> path due to complicated reasons such as environment changes, the lack of knowledge about the length of the <b>echo</b> path, and so on, resulting in residual <b>echo</b> signals. Another way to mitigate the <b>echo</b> effect is through <b>echo</b> suppression. Unlike an AEC, an acoustic <b>echo</b> suppressor (AES) achieves <b>echo</b> attenuation by means of spectral modification. This approach usually has a much lower complexity, and is robust against minor <b>echo</b> path changes. However, it sometimes introduces audible distortions to the processed signal. Many practical systems combine an AEC and an AES in a sequential way such that the former achieves major <b>echo</b> cancellation, and the latter attenuates the residual <b>echoes.</b> In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach for addressing the <b>echo</b> problem. The full-band signal is split into two frequency bands, with AEC being applied to the lower band, and an AES to the upper band, respectively. Through subjective tests we demonstrate the superior quality and robustness of this new method, compared to a full-band AEC or a full-band AES. 1...|$|R
