25|$|Fluoride in {{groundwater}} {{presents a}} public health problem in Jharkhand. A recent survey led by the Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Ranchi in collaboration with UNICEF in the northwest districts of Palamau and Garhwa found fluoride levels above the drinking WHO drinking water guidelines. Excessive amounts of fluoride in drinking water can lead to dental fluorosis, prevalent bone fractures, and skeletal fluorosis, an irreversible disabling condition. Some work has focused on combating fluorosis through increased calcium intake by consuming local plants. Researchers at Princeton University and the Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Ranchi are currently investigating defluoridation options, while performing an <b>epidemiological</b> <b>survey</b> to assess the extent of fluoride linked health problems {{and the impact of}} future interventions.|$|E
25|$|In 2001-2002, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) {{conducted}} the National <b>Epidemiological</b> <b>Survey</b> on Alcoholism and Related Conditions (NESARC). Similarly structured to the NLAES, the survey conducted in-person interviews with 43,093 individuals. This time, {{respondents were asked}} if they had ever attended a 12-step meeting for an alcohol problem in their lifetime (the question was not AA-specific). 1441 (3.4%) of respondents answered the question affirmatively. Answers were further broken down into three categories: disengaged, those who started attending {{at some point in the}} past but had ceased attending at some point in the past year (988); continued engagement, those who started attending at some point in the past and continued to attend during the past year (348); and newcomers, those who started attending during the past year (105). In their discussion of the findings, Kaskautas et al. (2008) state that to study disengagement, only the disengaged and continued engagement should be utilized (pg. 270).|$|E

For Ascaris eggs the Kato method is ideal for epidemiological studies: For Hookworm and Trichostrongylus infections, Kato method was less sensitive but still it was at an acceptable level for <b>epidemiological</b> <b>surveys.</b> Also, Kato technique was more sensitive {{in areas where the}} intensity of infection is high.
