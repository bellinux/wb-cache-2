5|$|As well as {{identifying}} {{direct evidence}} of a crime, digital forensics {{can be used to}} attribute evidence to specific suspects, confirm alibis or statements, determine intent, identify sources (for example, in copyright cases), or authenticate documents. <b>Investigations</b> <b>are</b> much broader in scope than other areas of forensic analysis (where the usual aim is to provide answers to a series of simpler questions) often involving complex time-lines or hypotheses.|$|E
5|$|TPP is {{distinguished}} from {{other forms of}} periodic paralysis (especially hypokalemic periodic paralysis) with thyroid function tests on the blood. These are normal in the other forms, and in thyrotoxicosis the levels of thyroxine and triiodothyronine are elevated, with resultant suppression of TSH production by the pituitary gland. Various other <b>investigations</b> <b>are</b> usually performed to separate the different causes of hyperthyroidism.|$|E

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} may be suspected on {{the basis}} of the history and examination. To confirm the diagnosis, as well as excluding alternative causes, several <b>investigations</b> <b>are</b> required; more investigations may be performed if the history is not typical or the patient is more likely to have an alternative problem: children, men, the elderly, or women who are not overweight.|$|E
5|$|At the CFM Mortuary, {{the family}} will view and {{identify}} {{the body of the}} deceased {{in the presence of a}} coroner, who reviews the case and determines if an autopsy is required. The family will be informed of the coroner's decision and the time to claim the body for the funeral. If an autopsy is conducted and reveals that the death is unnatural, the police will conduct further investigations into the cause of death with the family's assistance. Once the <b>investigations</b> <b>are</b> complete, {{the family will}} be told to attend a coroner's inquiry at the Subordinate Courts. Only after that will they be able to claim the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{should be}} considered in anyone who develops a fever within two weeks of being in the tropics or subtropics. It can be difficult to distinguish dengue fever and chikungunya, a similar viral infection that shares many symptoms and occurs in similar parts of the world to dengue. Often, <b>investigations</b> <b>are</b> performed to exclude other conditions that cause similar symptoms, such as malaria, leptospirosis, viral hemorrhagic fever, typhoid fever, meningococcal disease, measles, and influenza. Zika fever also has similar symptoms as dengue.|$|E

5|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of hypopituitarism vary, depending on which hormones are undersecreted and on the underlying cause of the abnormality. The diagnosis of hypopituitarism is made by blood tests, but often specific scans and other <b>investigations</b> <b>are</b> needed to find the underlying cause, such as tumors of the pituitary, and the ideal treatment. Most hormones controlled by the secretions of the pituitary can be replaced by tablets or injections. Hypopituitarism is a rare disease, but may be significantly underdiagnosed in people with previous traumatic brain injury. The first description of the condition was made in 1914 by the German physician Dr Morris Simmonds.|$|E
5|$|A {{more general}} medical and {{neurological}} examination {{may be needed}} to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as metabolic disturbance, systemic infection, syphilis, AIDS dementia complex, epilepsy, limbic encephalitis, and brain lesions. Stroke, multiple sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy Body dementia may also be associated with schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms. It may be necessary to rule out a delirium, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness, and indicates an underlying medical illness. <b>Investigations</b> <b>are</b> not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific medical indication or possible adverse effects from antipsychotic medication. In children hallucinations must be separated from typical childhood fantasies.|$|E
5|$|A {{separate}} {{criminal investigation}} {{focused on the}} illegal factory itself. Almost all factories and homes in the area were illegal and unauthorised, and do not follow building codes and sanctions. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said action would be taken against {{the owners of the}} factory and house, and Superintendent of Police of South 24 Parganas S. N. Gupta said that the owners of the building would be arrested. Investigation has shown that the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) issued notices to the building on three separate occasions, in 1988, 1989, and 1992, yet took no further action. It has been shown, however, that the KMC also approved trade licences for two businesses to operate from the building. The owner of the building, Khurshid Alam, has had a police complaint filed against him by the fire department for illegal construction charges. Mohammed Sagir Ahmed and Mohammed Asif, the owners of Tenex Exports, also face related charges. Both <b>investigations</b> <b>are</b> ongoing.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{presence}} of valence 5f electrons, neptunium and its alloys exhibit very interesting magnetic behavior, like many other actinides. These can range from the itinerant band-like character characteristic of the transition metals to the local moment behavior typical of scandium, yttrium, and the lanthanides. This stems from 5f-orbital hybridization with the orbitals of the metal ligands, {{and the fact that the}} 5f orbital is relativistically destabilized and extends outwards. For example, pure neptunium is paramagnetic, NpAl3 is ferromagnetic, NpGe3 has no magnetic ordering, and NpSn3 behaves fermionically. <b>Investigations</b> <b>are</b> underway regarding alloys of neptunium with uranium, americium, plutonium, zirconium, and iron, so as to recycle long-lived waste isotopes such as neptunium-237 into shorter-lived isotopes more useful as nuclear fuel.|$|E
5|$|If {{an offense}} is filed, the issue may be {{investigated}} by police on duty. Permission for {{search and seizure}} is issued by the police prosecutor on duty at the police district. Apprehended people are permitted a free defense counsel at the public's expense. If the police wish to keep apprehended people in detention, the issue is brought to the relevant district court, a process which may be repeated several times if the custody needs to be extended. <b>Investigations</b> <b>are</b> led by a police prosecutor. During investigation, {{the case may be}} concluded as a non-criminal offense, dismissed, or transferred to another police district. Minor cases with a positive finding may be resolved by police penalty notice, settlement by a conflict resolution board and withdrawal of prosecution.|$|E
5|$|In general, in adults, <b>investigations</b> <b>are</b> {{not needed}} in mild cases. There {{is a very}} low risk of {{pneumonia}} if all vital signs and auscultation are normal. In persons requiring hospitalization, pulse oximetry, chest radiography and blood tests—including a complete blood count, serum electrolytes, C-reactive protein level, and possibly liver function tests—are recommended. Procalcitonin may help determine the cause and support who should receive antibiotics. Countries with the greatest burden of disease include India (43million), China (21million) and Pakistan (10million). It {{is the leading cause}} of death among children in low income countries. Many of these deaths occur in the newborn period. The World Health Organization estimates that one in three newborn infant deaths is due to pneumonia. Approximately half of these deaths can be prevented, as they are caused by the bacteria for which an effective vaccine is available. In 2011, pneumonia was the most common reason for admission to the hospital after an emergency department visit in the U.S. for infants and children.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this <b>investigation</b> <b>was</b> to {{experimentally}} determine deflection data for 0 to 180 degree uniform thickness cantilever sectors. The basic deflection data {{is presented in the}} form of influence coefficients that can be utilized in the determination of the deflection of sectors as caused by any regular transverse loading. One phase of the <b>investigation</b> <b>was</b> specifically planned to achieve results that could be compared with an analytical solution of the problem. In addition to the basic experimentation, preliminary <b>investigation</b> <b>was</b> made of the effect of thickness and boundary fixity on the stiffness of cantilever sectors. Deflection modes as calculated from the data of this <b>investigation</b> <b>were</b> in close agreement with those determined by the analytical solution. Agreement in absolute magnitude was of the order of 15 percent for three loading conditions checked. Further investigation into the effect of thickness is considered desirable before the results of this <b>investigation</b> <b>are</b> applied to the determination of deflections for sectors of different thickness from those used in the <b>investigation.</b> The <b>investigation</b> <b>was</b> carried out in the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of dengue is typically made clinically, {{on the basis}} of reported symptoms and physical examination; this applies especially in endemic areas. However, early disease can be difficult to differentiate from other viral infections. A probable diagnosis is based on the findings of fever plus two of the following: nausea and vomiting, rash, generalized pains, low white blood cell count, positive tourniquet test, or any warning sign (see table) in someone who lives in an endemic area. Warning signs typically occur before the onset of severe dengue. The tourniquet test, which is particularly useful in settings where no laboratory <b>investigations</b> <b>are</b> readily available, involves the application of a blood pressure cuff at between the diastolic and systolic pressure for five minutes, followed by the counting of any petechial hemorrhages; a higher number makes a {{diagnosis of}} dengue more likely with the cut off being more than 10 to 20 per 1inch2 (6.25cm2).|$|E
