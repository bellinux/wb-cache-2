30|$|The {{main focus}} {{of the work is}} on the reassigned spectrogram. This time-frequency {{representation}} is here proposed as alternative to <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> <b>STFT</b> to derive a more accurate set of chroma features. Experimental results showed that better chord recognition rates can be obtained with TFR-based features, if compared to performance provided by traditional STFT-based chroma features. Applying harmonic component separation in the spectral domain further increases this performance. The experimental section comprises a quantitative analysis which shows the effectiveness of time-frequency reassignment from different perspectives and with a different assignment to some key parameters.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{evaluate}} {{some of the}} alternative methods commonly applied in the first stages of the signal processing chain of automatic melody extraction systems. Namely, the first two stages are studied – the extraction of sinusoidal components and the computation of a time-pitch salience function, {{with the goal of}} determining the benefits and caveats of each approach under the specific context of predominant melody estimation. The approaches are evaluated on a data-set of polyphonic music containing several musical genres with different singing/playing styles, using metrics specifically designed for measuring the usefulness of each step for melody extraction. The results suggest that equal loudness filtering and frequency/amplitude correction methods provide significant improvements, whilst using a multi-resolution spectral transform results in only a marginal improvement compared to <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> <b>STFT.</b> <b>The</b> effect of key parameters in the computation of the salience function is also studied and discussed. 1...|$|R

30|$|In real {{applications}} we {{deal with}} signals corrupted by noise. If noise is additive with Gaussian probability density function (pdf), <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> time-frequency distributions represent a maximum likelihood (ML) estimate [6]. However, if the signal is corrupted by noise with heavy-tailed pdf (usually caused by environmental or human-made activities), <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> TFDs produce poor results. Consequently, the robust time-frequency distributions have been introduced [6 – 12]. The simplest and {{the most commonly used}} robust time-frequency representation is the robust short-time Fourier transform (STFT). The marginal median robust STFT has been introduced as an ML estimate of signals with Laplacian noise [8]. This form can also be successfully used for other types of heavy-tailed noises. The L-estimate robust STFT is introduced for signals with a mixture of Gaussian and impulse noises [9]. As in the case of <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> <b>STFT,</b> <b>the</b> main drawback of the robust STFT is a poor time-frequency resolution. In order to improve the time-frequency concentration, the robust forms of the Wigner distribution (WD) have been introduced [9 – 12]. They can provide an ideal concentration for signals with a linear instantaneous frequency (IF). However, for multicomponent signals the cross-terms appear. The robust S-method that combines good properties of the STFT and the WD has been introduced to provide a cross-terms free representation [12]. However, it cannot provide good concentration for signals with fast varying IF. Thus, the time-frequency distributions with complex-lag argument have been used to estimate nonlinear and fast IF variations [13 – 20]. Similarly as other TFDs, these distributions provide poor signal representation in the presence of heavy-tailed noise.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this study, the {{production}} of floor tile with addition of tuff <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> masse was aimed. Chemical, mineralogical, particle size distribution and thermal analysis were performed on Afyon region tuffs. Samples were produced by adding 11, 18, 20, 24 % volcanic tuff by weight <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> floor tile masse which were composed of clay, pegmatite, feldspar, and kaolin. In the 5 various mixing series test specimen were produced by dry pressing method. Samples were fired at 1213 °C and were kept for 40 minutes which is standard sample fire temperature. Water absorption, viscosity, apparent density, firing shrinkage and compressive strength tests were performed on the fired specimen and compared with specifications and evaluated. As a result, addition of volcanic tuff <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> masse by adding 10 - 20 % {{can be used for}} {{the production}} of tile floor. Alkaline properties were observed on the volcanic tuff. Water absorption and viscosity values of tuff were affected in very little amount.
