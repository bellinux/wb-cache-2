5|$|A {{year after}} his first novel was {{published}} Maugham began contributing to magazines and periodicals; initially these were short stories, but he also wrote opinion pieces, non-fictional and autobiographical work, and letters. Much of his non-fictional writing was published in book form, and covered a range of topics, including travel, current affairs, autobiography and belles lettres. Maugham was also editor {{on a number of}} works, which often included adding a preface or introductory chapter to the work of other writers. In 1903 his first play was performed, A Man of Honour at the Imperial Theatre, London. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> many of his works that were produced for the stage, and with the later development of cinema, his novels and stories were also adapted for the big screen.|$|E

A 1435 example survives from Leeds castle; its face is decorated with the images of the Crucifixion of Jesus, Mary and St George.|$|E
5|$|During the Prussian {{invasion}} of Hesse in June 1866, Victoria and Elisabeth {{were sent to}} England {{to live with their}} grandmother until hostilities were ended by the absorption of Hesse-Kassel and parts of Hesse-Darmstadt into Prussia. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, military hospitals were set up in the palace grounds at Darmstadt, and she helped in the soup kitchens with her mother. She remembered the intense cold of the winter, and being burned on the arm by hot soup. In 1872, Victoria's eighteen-month-old brother, Friedrich, was diagnosed with haemophilia. The diagnosis came as a shock to the royal families of Europe; it had been twenty years since Queen Victoria had given birth to her haemophiliac son, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, {{and it was the first}} indication that the bleeding disorder in the royal family was hereditary. The following year, Friedrich fell from a window onto stone steps and died. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> many tragedies to beset the Hesse family.|$|E
