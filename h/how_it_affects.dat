500|$|Scholar Yasmin Y. DeGout cites [...] "The Couple" [...] as {{an example}} of Angelou's {{practice}} of subtly including more than one level of meaning in her poems, of her ability to translate her personal experience into political discourse, and her placement of themes of racism and liberation. [...] Angelou combines liberation ideology and poetic technique to challenge society's concepts of gender identity, especially in <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>affects</b> women. [...] She varies the length of the poem's lines, beginning in the first stanza and continuing throughout the poem, to convey ambiguity and doubt, and to demand that the reader question their perceptions of gender and power. [...] "The Couple", starting in its second stanza, attacks class-based ideals of masculinity in society. [...] The poem ends by demanding that the social constructs surrounding gender and class end, and insists that human survival depends upon recognizing shared emotions and experience, regardless of one's gender or position in society.|$|E

500|$|Atwell, who portrayed Carter in , , and the Agent Carter short film, {{expressed}} interest in reprising the role for the series in October 2013; ABC Entertainment president Paul Lee confirmed her involvement in January 2014. Carter is the first female character to headline a standalone story {{as part of the}} Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), ahead of popular comic characters such as Black Widow and Captain Marvel. Unlike other major Marvel heroes, Carter does not have any superpowers, instead the writers [...] "always said her superpower is the fact that other people underestimate her. And she often uses that to her advantage, because she doesn’t have superstrength." [...] Atwell said it was [...] "thrilling" [...] to explore [...] "the backdrop of this male-dominated world, where women are still in the workforce, unspoken for and struggling to find a place outside the home" [...] and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>affects</b> Carter, who must deal with this along with the missions she receives.

Costume designer Giovanna Ottobre-Melton gave the outfits an [...] "hourglass style with strength in the tailoring and defined shoulders, but not overly exaggerated." [...] For the character's tactical gear, World War II underground military looks were referenced. Gabriella Graves portrays a young Carter.|$|E

[...] He further mentioned that [...] "Along with providing us with some very emotional and dramatic episodes, the subject also gives us the opportunity to educate and highlight a very pertinent issue using characters our viewers know well. As well as seeing <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>affects</b> Jill as she comes to terms with her condition, the story will also illustrate how it impacts her family and those closest to her." [...] The producers considered Jill to be the right character to tackle this issue due to her being the show's longest-running character, as well as other factors: her unhealthy lifestyle, age and [...] "bullish personality that would deny anything was wrong". Following the episode where Jill is diagnosed, Walton appeared in a public service announcement urging viewers to visit the American Heart Association website. Young knew that the soap opera had to be [...] "very responsible", stating: [...] "We did not want to sensationalize this.
