40|$|From February to September 1954, {{observations}} were　made of {{the rates}} of flow and the water temperatures at a spring called　"Tanaka-no-Yu", Misasa Hot Springs, Tottori Prefecture. Simultaneously with these observations, the water level of the River Misasa and that of an <b>irrigation</b>　<b>stream</b> nearby were also determined. The procedures for the observations {{were the same as}} in the previous report. Comparing the results here obtaind wite those previously obtaind, and referring to the conclusions in the previous　report, the author has been led to the following conclusions. From the observations in the period from February to September, 1954, as from those in the period from June, 1953 to　January, 1954, a positive correlation　was found between the rate of flow and the water teperature, the correlarion coefficient being 0. 828 (highly significant). The analsis of variance of the obseryed results showed that the rate of flow and the water temperature appear to be affected by the water levels of the River and of the <b>irrigation</b> <b>stream,</b> and also　by their interaction. This conclusion supports what was deduced in the previous report. The average water levels of the River and of the <b>irrigation</b> <b>stream,</b> the average rates of flow and the average water temperatures, for the　period from June to September in 1953, were compared with　those for the period from June to September in 1954. The differences in the average water levels of the River, the average rates of flow and the average water temperatures are significant; while that in average water levels of the　stream is not significant. From this it may be concluded that the increase in the rate of flow {{and the rise of the}} water temperature were resulted from the upheaval of the water level of the River, which followed the construction of a dam there...|$|E

Groundwater provides over half the drinking water for the nation; it is important to protect such an important resource. Groundwater contamination, though almost impossible to stop in some areas, can be minimized by delineating vulnerable areas. The use of modeling with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) contributes significantly to the delineation of vulnerable areas. The DRASTIC model, introduced by the U. S.

DRASTIC is an acronym standing for Depth to water, net Recharge, Aquifer media, Soil media, Topography, Impact of the vadose zone, and hydraulic Conductivity. Well test results have shown that areas of Houston County, Minnesota may be contaminated and that further research is needed.

40|$|Subsurface drip {{irrigation}} (SDI) offers well-documented potential for improving water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture. However, {{in common with}} other forms of irrigation is liable to exclude soil air (and therefore oxygen) around the root zone during and following irrigation events, thus reducing root function and crop performance. When is practiced with oxygation (i. e., aerating the rhizosphere {{by way of the}} <b>irrigation</b> <b>stream)</b> it could transform the irrigation industry, for it provides a source of oxygen in a root environment that suffers from temporal hypoxia, and occasionally from anoxia.

Oxygation assures optimal root function, microbial activity, and mineral transformations, and leads to enhanced yield and water use efficiency under hypoxic conditions. It also improves plant performance and yield under irrigated conditions previously considered to be satisfactory for crop growth, and offers scope to offset some of the negative impacts of compaction and salinity, related to poor soil aeration, on crop growth. Representing minimal capital investment and recurrent costs, economic returns appear very favorable, as do associated benefits to the environment, measured as reduced drainage, containment of rising water tables, better nutrient use efficiency, and reduced demand by agriculture for irrigation water.

Both {{of these processes}} are directly proportional to {{the energy of the}} furrow <b>irrigation</b> <b>stream.</b> This stream must be large enough at the application point to provide sufficient water for infiltration along the entire furrow length to meet the purposes of irrigation. Where slopes exceed about 0. 7 % on many silt loam soils, the flow velocity combined with the stream size at the upper ends of fields has sufficient energy to erode soil (Berg and Carter, 1980). As the furrow stream size decreases from infiltration along the furrow, the energy to erode and transport evil also decreases. At some point along the furrow the stream energy reaches a level where it no longer erodes soil. Then, further down slope, the energy reaches a level where the stream will no longer carry the accumulated sediment from upstream erosion. At that point sedimentation begins and continues downslope.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to point out}} to farmers, agricultural specialists, and others who may be interested, pertinent facts regarding rainfall intensity and other meteorological data {{that have to do with}} the wearing down of range and agricultural soils, and to present by means of diagrams illustrations of general relationships between the rate of wearing down of irrigated soils, the size of the <b>irrigation</b> <b>stream</b> and the slope of the eroding surface. Large streams running down steep slopes, whether from rainfall or from irrigation, constitute a destructive process that cannot be completely controlled. Fortunately, vegetation protects the soil against the destructive effect of rain and irrigation water, and, conversely, water promotes the growth of vegetation. A most constructive step, therefore, would be a carefully considered plan for grazing and for maintaining a vegetative mantle on the soil surface wherever and whenever this can be done without hindering farming operations. Under normal conditions when the surface soil is in good health, rain and irrigation water may penetrate better than when it is puddled and compacted. Obviously runoff occurs when rainfall intensity exceeds the infiltration capacity of the soil. The amount of erosion depends upon the size of the stream and the slope of the eroding surface as well as upon the character of the surface soil. Even though the rainfall is comparatively light, if it exceeds the rate at which it may be absorbed by the soil, the size and velocity of the resulting stream must increase as it moves down the slope...|$|E

The field experiments were carried out in free draining furrows having 165 m length and 0. 006 m/m slope in Karaj. Required urea fertilizer was applied in four stages: before planting, in seven leaves stage, shooting stage and earring stage. The first stage was accomplished by traditional method and other stages were applied with irrigation water (fertigation). Fertigation timing was respectively 60, 35, and 20 min in the three fertigation stages.

40|$|AbstractSubsurface drip {{irrigation}} (SDI) can substantially {{reduce the amount}} of irrigation water needed for corn production. However, corn yields need to be improved to offset the initial cost of drip installation. Air-injection is at least potentially applicable to the (SDI) system. However, the vertical stream of emitted air moving above the emitter outlet directly toward the surface creates a chimney effect, which should be avoided, and to ensure that there are adequate oxygen for root respiration. A field study was conducted in 2010 and 2011, to evaluate the effect of air-injection into the <b>irrigation</b> <b>stream</b> in SDI on the performance of corn. Experimental treatments were {{drip irrigation}} (DI), SDI, and SDI with air injection. The leaf area per plant with air injected was 1. 477 and 1. 0045 times greater in the aerated treatment than in DI and SDI, respectively. Grain filling was faster, and terminated earlier under air-injected drip system, than in DI. Root distribution, stem diameter, plant height and number of grains per plant were noticed to be higher under air injection than DI and SDI. Air injection had the highest water use efficiency (WUE) and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) in both growing seasons; with values of 1. 442 and 1. 096 in 2010 and 1. 463 and 1. 112 in 2011 for WUE and IWUE respectively.

A. Replogle. The chute, where a new gauging station {{is located at the}} half-way point of its length equal to two times the throat length, worked satisfactory for a chute slope of 3 %. For clear-water flow the chute showed a supercritical and curvilinear flow having a hydrostatic pressure consistently located at the halfway of the chute. For sediment-laden flow with a concentration of 3 % by weight of clear mortar sand, behavior was similar to the clear-water. Sediment deposits filled the approach channel of the flume and plugged the intake pipe of the supercritical gauging station causing it to fail. This failure was compensated for by the use of the new supercritical additional gauging station located in the chute, which remains clean and continues to measure the flow-rate. Hydraulic behavior of the stage-discharge curves for the sediment-laden flow flume was similar to the clear-water flow after the approach channel was filled. Prior to filling an inconsistent condition existed caused by the sediment movements in the approach channel. It was shown that this flume might be used in the field with errors of 5 % or less. In addition, a computer program was developed to compute the stage-discharge curve using the dynamic equation of gradually varied flow, which may be used to compute the stage-discharge curve in new flumes.

Soil erosion and sediment yield in furrow irrigation {{has not been}} fully evaluated in Samaru-Zaria. This study sought to establish {{the interactive effects of}} <b>irrigation</b> <b>stream</b> sizes (2. 5, 1. 5, and 0. 5 l/s); furrow lengths (90 and 45 m); and furrow widths (0. 75 and 0. 9 m) randomized in a split-plot design on soil erosion, growth, and yield of maize (Zea mays L.). The 90 - and 4 -m long furrows were herein referred to as long and short furrows respectively, while the 0. 75 - and 0. 9 -wide furrows were termed narrow and wide furrows for convenience sake. The field experiment involved irrigating maize on the normal straight furrow irrigation method on a sandy loam soil in the Irrigation Research Farm of Institute for Agricultural Research (I. A. R), Samaru-Zaria, in 2009 / 2010 and 2010 / 2011 dry irrigation seasons. Maize plants irrigated at 2. 5 l/s on long narrow furrows were most stunted (118. 396 m) while irrigating at 1. 5 l/s in long wide furrows produced tallest maize plants (169. 034 m). Irrigating at 2. 5 l/s in long narrow furrows delayed days to 50 % tasseling (77. 632 days) and days to 50 % plant maturity (79. 125 days). Highest average sediment concentration (41. 697 g/l) and runoff volume (147. 861 ltr) were recorded in short narrow furrows irrigated at 2. 5 l/s. The long narrow furrows irrigated at 2. 5 l/s produced largest soil erosion (0. 603 t/ha). Best grain yield (5. 19 t/ha) was achieved in long wide furrows irrigated at 1. 5 l/s. The severity of soil erosion and its impact on crop production were greater in long narrow furrow irrigated at 2. 5 l/s. Irrigation at 1. 5 l/s in long wide furrows trimmed down soil erosion and better maize growth and yields. Furrow irrigation should be designed and operated professionally to avert ecological deterioration, and sustain soil’s quality and crop productivity...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{competition}} on supply {{of fresh water}} for irrigation by agricultural, domestic, sports and industrial users demands water use efficient irrigation methods and compliance with environmental regulations. Drip irrigation (DI) and subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) are advocated for improvements in water use efficiency (WUE) and are increasingly being adopted by horticultural industries in Australia and overseas. Greater flexibility for automation and versatility of application of drip irrigation technology encourage wider-scale adoption by these industries. However, the higher initial investment for installation and lack of significant yield gains due to drip irrigation compared to conventional irrigation methods are somehow deterrents for broad-scale adoption. Ways to optimise the use of DI and SDI will have multiplier effects on water savings for irrigation in agricultural and other industries and minimize environmental impacts associated with traditional irrigation methods. One of the significant areas where greater optimization of DI and SDI is realized is {{through the use of}} aerated water for irrigation (oxygation). Sustained wetting fronts around emitters associated with DI/SSDI impose hypoxia in the rhizosphere. This impedes root respiration leading to sub-optimal plant performance. As irrigation water exits an emitter, it purges soil pores of soil air (containing up to 20 % by volume of oxygen) with water that contains less than 10 ppm oxygen, a quantity we have shown is used up quickly by roots and soil microbes. Rising soil temperatures, salinity, and soil compaction will exacerbate this effect, as may disease such as Phytophthora of pineapple. Plant roots and soil microbes require oxygen for respiration. In soils with inadequate aeration the lack of oxygen results in reduced plant growth and diminished productivity for many reasons, including: reduced root growth and root size; reduced root ability to absorb minerals and water; reduced photosynthesis and plant growth due to stomatal closure; loss of soil N due to the in-activity of microbes; adverse changes in soil chemistry; increased susceptibility to disease, and an alteration of the balance and supply of plant growth regulators. Aeration of the <b>irrigation</b> <b>stream,</b> a process termed ‘oxygation’, overcomes this constraint. Oxygation is a new innovation in irrigation technologies. Aerated DI and SDI by different methods, such as venturi for air injection, allows for the simultaneous application of water, air and other agro-chemicals directly to the crop root zone. Therefore, it can potentially improve crop yield and water use efficiency. Conventional irrigation methods such as flood irrigation have large inefficiencies due to run-off, drainage and evaporative loss. SDI can significantly improve the WUE over that of flood irrigation, and oxygation can significantly improve WUE of SDI. Oxygation involves mixing air with water using a venturi and delivering via a surface or subsurface drip irrigation system. An oxygation system can be installed as part of a new SDI system or may be retrospectively fitted to any existing SDI system. A venturi air injector is installed within the pipeline and draws air directly into the water stream. A single venturi can be installed immediately after the pump outlet and the air distributed through the main line to sub mains and lateral drip lines, or a single injector may be fitted to the beginning of each drip line. The amount of air ingress depends on the pressure differential across the venturi and the motive flow through the venturi...|$|E
5000|$|Chalchiuhtlicue or [...] "she of the jade skirt," [...] was {{the deity}} {{connected}} with the worship of ground water. Her shrines were therefore by springs, <b>streams,</b> <b>irrigation</b> ditches, or aqueducts, {{the most important of}} these shrines being at Pantitlan, in the center of Lake Tetzcoco. Sometimes described as Tlaloc's sister, Chalchiuhtlicue was impersonated by ritual performers wearing the green skirt that identifies the deity. Like that of Tlaloc, this cult was linked to the earth, fertility and nature's regeneration.|$|R
40|$|Climate {{changes are}} {{expected}} {{to result in a}} warmer global climate, with increased inter-annual variability. In this study, the possible impacts of these climate changes on <b>irrigation</b> and low <b>stream</b> flow are investigated using a distributed hydrological model of a sandy catchment in western Denmark. The IPCC climate scenario A 1 B was chosen {{as the basis for the}} study, and meteorological forcings (precipitation, reference evapotranspiration and temperature) derived from the ECHAM 5 -RACMO 2 regional climate model for the period 2071 – 2100 was applied to the model. Two bias correction methods, Delta Change and Distribution-Based Scaling, were used to evaluate the importance of the bias correction method. Using the annual irrigation amounts, the minimum stream flow, the median minimum stream flow and the mean stream flow as indicators, the <b>irrigation</b> and the <b>stream</b> flow predicted using the two methods were compared. The study found that irrigation is significantly underestimated and low stream flow in overestimated when using the delta change method, due to the inability of this method to account for changes in inter-annual variability of precipitation and reference ET and the resulting effects on irrigation demands. Additionally, future increases in CO 2 are found to have a significant effect on both irrigation and low flow, due to reduced transpiration from plants...|$|R
40|$|In this work, two {{different}} extraction {{procedures for the}} analysis of different polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in water by microextraction by packed sorbent (MEPS) have been compared in terms of sensitivity, reliability and time of analysis. The first method, called “draw-eject”, consists of a sequence of cycles of aspirations and injections in the same vial; the second one, called “extract-discard”, consists of a similar cycle sequence, but the aspired sample in this case is discarded into waste. The relevant partition equilibriums and extraction rates have been calculated by multivariate regression from the data obtained after MEPS gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (MEPS-GC–MS) analysis of 16 PAHs from water samples. Partitioning parameters for a priori prediction of solute sorption equilibrium, recoveries and preconcentration effects in aqueous and solvent systems have been calculated and compared for the two extraction procedures. Finally, real samples from sea, agricultural <b>irrigation</b> wells, <b>streams</b> and tap water were analyzed...|$|R
2500|$|Between 1500 and 1150 BCE San José Mogote {{grew from}} a few house {{structures}} to a village occupying a land area of about 2000 m2 (five acres), the largest of some 25 villages in the Valley of the Oaxaca and the only community in the area with public buildings (Price and Feinman 2005:320-321). The introduction of two methods of irrigation may {{have been responsible for}} improving agricultural productivity. [...] These included running <b>irrigation</b> ditches from <b>streams</b> and [...] "pot irrigation", which consisted of dipping water out of a number of shallow wells to pour onto the crops (Evans 2004, p.145).|$|R
