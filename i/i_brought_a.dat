5|$|Jarrow {{had been}} a {{settlement}} {{since at least the}} 8th century. In the early 19th century, a coal industry developed before the establishment of the shipyard in 1851. Over the following 80 years more than 1,000 ships were launched in Jarrow. In the 1920s, a combination of mismanagement and changed world trade conditions following World War <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> decline which led eventually to the yard's closure. Plans for its replacement by a modern steelworks plant were frustrated by opposition from the British Iron and Steel Federation, an employers' organisation with its own plans for the industry. The failure of the steelworks plan, and the lack of any prospect of large-scale employment in the town, were the final factors that led to the decision to march.|$|E
25|$|World War <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> {{sharp end}} to the boom. Red Deer emerged as a small, quiet, but prosperous, prairie city. In 1922, the provincial {{institution}} {{for the care of}} the mentally handicapped, currently known as the Michener Centre, was established in the city. Prospects looked good for modest but sustainable growth.|$|E
25|$|Although Lionel is {{the most}} {{enduring}} brand of O gauge trains, a variety of manufacturers made trains in this scale. Prior to World War I, the majority of toy trains sold in the United States were German imports made by Märklin, Bing, Fandor, and other companies. World War <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> halt to these German imports, and protective tariffs after the war {{made it difficult for}} them to compete.|$|E

25|$|Captain James Wilson, while {{drilling}} for salt, struck the first natural gas well in 1815. It was drilled {{at the site}} that is now the junction of Brooks Street and Kanawha Boulevard (near the present-day state capitol complex.) In 1817, coal was first discovered and gradually became used as the fuel for the salt works. The Kanawha salt industry declined in importance after 1861, until the onset of World War <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> demand for chemical products. The chemicals needed were chlorine and sodium hydroxide, which could be made from salt brine.|$|E
25|$|The {{people of}} Marlborough favoured a coastal route and began work south, while in Canterbury, work {{initially}} began on an inland route, with Waipara linked to Culverden in 1886. Although {{the line to}} Culverden was treated as the main line for decades, it eventually {{became part of the}} Waiau Branch. At the start of the 20th century, work began on a coastal route northwards from Waipara, with the line opened to Parnassus in 1912. Construction then proceeded up the Leader River valley as part of a somewhat inland route to Kaikoura via river valleys, but the start of World War <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> halt to construction and the 3km of track laid beyond Parnassus was removed. The war also brought a halt to work at the northern end, with the coastal village of Wharanui established as the terminus of the line south from Blenheim.|$|E
500|$|I was {{itching to}} move into drama and knew I had exactly the source {{material}} I wanted. I'd discovered M.R. James at boarding school and loved him. So I met with Paul Fox, {{who was at the}} time Controller of BBC1. <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> copy of M.R. James's Ghost Stories with me, with a bookmark stuck in [...] "". The fact that period drama always has been very popular at the BBC probably helped.|$|E
50|$|World War <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>an</b> end to {{this phase}} but {{indicated}} {{the beginning of a}} number of anti-art movements, such as Dada, including the work of Marcel Duchamp, and of Surrealism. Artist groups like de Stijl and Bauhaus developed new ideas about the interrelation of the arts, architecture, design, and art education.|$|R
50|$|In the 20th century, the {{two most}} {{important}} production centers for professional theatre were São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. They were centers of industrial and economic development. Even with the development of these two theatres, World War <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>an</b> end to tours by European theatres so there were no productions in Brazil during this time.|$|R

500|$|The Medieval Chola king Aditya I {{conquered the}} Pallava kingdom, {{including}} Kanchipuram, after defeating the Pallava ruler Aparajitavarman (880897) in about 890. Under the Cholas, {{the city was}} {{the headquarters of the}} northern viceroyalty. The province was renamed [...] "Jayamkonda Cholamandalam" [...] during the reign of King Raja Raja Chola I (9851014), who constructed the Karchapeswarar Temple and renovated the Kamakshi Amman Temple. His son, Rajendra Chola I (101244) constructed the Yathothkari Perumal Temple. According to the Siddhantasaravali of Trilocana Sivacharya, Rajendra Chola <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> band of Saivas with him on his return from the Chola expedition to North India and settled them in Kanchipuram. In about 1218, the Pandya king Maravarman Sundara Pandyan (12161238) invaded the Chola country, making deep inroads into the kingdom which was saved by the intervention of the Hoysala king Vira Narasimha II (12201235), who fought {{on the side of the}} Chola king Kulothunga Chola III. Inscriptions indicate the presence of a powerful Hoysala garrison in Kanchipuram, which remained in the city until about 1230.Shortly afterwards, Kanchipuram was conquered by the Telugu Cholas, from whom Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan I took the city in 1258. The city remained with the Pandyas until 1311 when the Sambuvarayars declared independence, taking advantage of the anarchy caused by Malik Kafur's invasion. After short spells of occupation by Ravivarman Kulasekhara of Venad (Quilon, Kerala) in 13131314 and the Kakatiya ruler Prataparudra II, Kanchipuram was conquered by the Vijayanagar general Kumara Kampana, who defeated the Madurai Sultanate in 1361.|$|E
2500|$|World War <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> {{change in}} the tastes of the theatregoing public. [...] Edwardes died in 1915, and Millar's husband was in poor health. After {{appearing}} in two Monckton revues (Bric à Brac (1915; she sang [...] "Neville was a Devil") and Airs and Graces (1917)), two unsuccessful musical comedies (Houp La! (1916) and Flora (1918)) and some productions in the provinces, Millar left the stage in 1918. Monckton died on 15 February 1924. [...] Two months later, on 30 April 1924, Millar married the 2nd Earl of Dudley. Before the war, {{he had been the}} Governor-General of Australia. [...] Lord Dudley died in 1932.|$|E

50|$|World War <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>an</b> end to {{this early}} period. Where the rapid {{development}} {{of science and technology}} during the late 19th century motivated the optimistic works of these early science fiction authors, the horrors of industrialised warfare and specifically the application of advanced technologies in such a destructive manner made many French authors more pessimistic about the potential of technological development.|$|R

2500|$|World War <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> {{crisis in}} his development. Military service {{disrupted}} his life when {{at the age}} of 42 he was in the army. He was never able to work uninterrupted or over a period of time, and as a result he left many unfinished works and undeveloped [...] "beginnings". On one occasion, a superior officer demanded to know if he was [...] "this notorious Schoenberg, then"; Schoenberg replied: [...] "Beg to report, sir, yes. Nobody wanted to be, someone had to be, so I let it be me" [...] (according to Norman , this is a reference to Schoenberg's apparent [...] "destiny" [...] as the [...] "Emancipator of Dissonance").|$|E
2500|$|The Société des Artistes Indépendants (Society of Independent Artists), Salon des Indépendants {{was formed}} in Paris on 29 July 1884. The {{association}} began with the organization of massive exhibitions in Paris, choosing the slogan [...] "sans jury ni récompense" [...] ("without jury nor reward"). Albert Dubois-Pillet, Odilon Redon, Georges Seurat and Paul Signac were among its founders. For the following three decades their annual exhibitions set the trends in art of the early 20th century, along with the Salon d'Automne. This is where artworks were often first displayed and widely discussed. World War <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> closure to the salon, though the Artistes Indépendants remained active. Since 1920, the headquarters {{is located in the}} vast basements of the Grand Palais (next door to the Société des Artistes Français, the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, the Société du Salon d'Automne, and others).|$|E
2500|$|The French, German, Irish, and Swedish {{immigrants}} {{were replaced by}} Czech, Slovak, Italian, Polish, Mexican and Hmong immigrants. In 1879 the Czech Slovak immigrant community that was based {{at the intersection of}} St. Clair and West Seventh Streets purchased a lot at 383 Michigan from a sitting mayor of Saint Paul, William Dawson. They establish their first hall as a home to a number of their organizations, including a literary society Slovanska Lipa (1868–79), a fitness society Sokol (1882–present) and Česko-Slovanský Podporující Spolek (C.S.P.S.) or Czech-Slovak Protective Society as a fraternal benevolent/insurance group (C.S.P.S.) When the first hall burned, the second was built in 1887 with a third story added in 1917. St. Paul's C.S.P.S. Hall is the oldest Czech-Slovak Hall in the United States, as well as the oldest theater and national hall in the State of Minnesota. In 1977 it was declared a National and State Historic Site and placed on the National Register of Historic Sites as Building #77000763. The 1923 Payne Avenue State Bank served Scandinavian, German, Italian, and other European settlers who lived in the East Side neighborhood. World War <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> violent wave of anti-German sentiment to the city. The Saint Paul Public Schools stopped teaching the German language (which had been standard fare), German Christians congregations experienced harassment from the Minnesota National Guard, the [...] statue of [...] "Germania" [...] was removed from the Germania Life Insurance Company building, sauerkraut was temporarily renamed [...] "Liberty Cabbage," [...] and hamburgers were dubbed Salisbury Steak.|$|E

In 1915, DSJ learners burnt British and Italian flags in the school courtyard which forced the school to be closed.|$|R
