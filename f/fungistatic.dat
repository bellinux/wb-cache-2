50|$|Echinocandins noncompetitively inhibit beta-1,3-D-glucan synthase enzyme {{complex in}} {{susceptible}} fungi to disturb fungal cell glucan synthesis. Beta-glucan destruction prevents resistance against osmotic forces, {{which leads to}} cell lysis. They have <b>fungistatic</b> activity against Aspergillus species. and fungicidal activity against most Candida spp., including strains that are fluconazole-resistant. In vitro and mouse models show echinocandins may also enhance host immune responses by exposing highly antigenic beta-glucan epitopes that can accelerating host cellular recognition and inflammatory responses.|$|E
50|$|Fungicides are {{biocidal}} {{chemical compounds}} or biological organisms {{used to kill}} fungi or fungal spores. A <b>fungistatic</b> inhibits their growth. Fungi can cause serious damage in agriculture, resulting in critical losses of yield, quality, and profit. Fungicides are used both in agriculture and to fight fungal infections in animals. Chemicals used to control oomycetes, which are not fungi, are {{also referred to as}} fungicides, as oomycetes use the same mechanisms as fungi to infect plants.|$|E
50|$|Fluconazole is a <b>fungistatic</b> {{antifungal}} {{medication that}} is administered orally or intravenously. It {{is used to}} treat a variety of fungal infections, especially Candida infections of the vagina ("yeast infections'), mouth, throat, and bloodstream.

50|$|Drugs {{and drug}} {{candidates}} {{in this class}} are fungicidal against some yeasts (most species of Candida, but not against Cryptococcus, Trichosporon, and Rhodotorula). Echinocandins also have displayed activity against Candida biofilms, especially in synergistic activity with amphotericin B and additive activity with fluconazole. Echinocandins are <b>fungistatic</b> against some molds (Aspergillus, but not Fusarium and Rhizopus), and modestly or minimally active against dimorphic fungi (Blastomyces and Histoplasma). These have some activity against the spores of the fungus Pneumocystis carinii. Caspofungin {{is used in the}} treatment of febrile neutropenia and as salvage therapy for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis.

50|$|Their {{research}} {{started by}} collecting soil samples {{from all over}} the country. Dr. Hazen cultured Actinomycetes (microorganisms most frequently having antifungal properties) from each sample and tested them to see if any fungal activity was present. If any activity was found, the soil sample was shipped to Albany, where Dr. Brown prepared samples and extracts from the cultures by isolating the chemical agents that appeared to have the property of killing fungi. These new samples would then be shipped back to New York City, where Hazen would test the samples again for toxicity. She would expose the organisms against two fungi, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. She would then purify promising samples for further test of <b>fungistatic</b> and fungicidal activity.|$|E
5000|$|The Curcuma longa L. is a {{perennial}} herb, which {{belongs to the}} ginger family, Zingiberaceae. [...] The essential oil from {{the leaves of the}} herb is effective in treating many pathogenic fungi, such as Epidermophyton floccosum, M. gypseum, M. nanum, T. mentagrophytes, T. rubrum, and T. violaceum. [...] The essential oil is mainly composed of 26.4% terpinolene, 8% α-phellendren, 7.4% terpinen-4-ol, and 3.2% Sabinyl acetate. The oil is <b>fungistatic</b> and fungicidal to Microsporum nanum at concentrations of 2.0 and 2.5 µL/mL respectively. The treatment completely inhibits the mycelia growth of the ringworm caused by Microsporum nanum, Epidermophyton floccosum, Trichophyton rubrum, and Trichophyton violaceum. No adverse effect is reported yet. In addition, the juice from the rhizome of Curcuma longa also be used to treat skin infections, indolent ulcers, inflamed joints, and in purulent ophthalmia.|$|E
5000|$|Weisner in March, 1942 first {{noted the}} {{production}} of an antibiotic by strains of A. clavatus, and the active substance was known as clavatin. [...] Later the antibiotic was named clavacin in August, 1942 by Waksman, Horning and Spencer. Clavacin {{is also known as}} patulin. Patulin is receiving significant attention in the world today because of its manifestations in apple juices. Clavacin was noted to be valuable in the treatment of common-cold and applies a <b>fungistatic</b> or fungicidal effect on certain dermatophytes. A. clavatus with Phytophthora cryptogea in soil provided protection against damping of tomato seedlings, by decreasing the spreading of pathogens. Reversely, A. clavatus with the addition of glucose, increased the pathogenicity of Verticillium albo-atrum to tomatoes. A. clavatus also produces the following: Cytochalasin E, Cytochalasin K, Tryptoquivaline, Nortryptoquivalone, Nortryptoquivaline, Deoxytryptoquivaline, Deoxynortryptoquivaline, Tryptoquivaline E, and Tryptoquivaline N. Furthermore, A. clavatus isolates produce ribotoxins, which can help develop immunotherapy processes for cancer. A.clavatus has also been used in the formation of extracellular bionanoparticles from silver nitrate solutions. These nanoparticles display antimicrobial properties, which work against MRSA and MRSE.|$|E
50|$|The {{treatment}} of choice by dermatologists is a safe and inexpensive oral medication, griseofulvin, a secondary metabolite of the fungus Penicillium griseofulvin. This compound is <b>fungistatic</b> (inhibiting the growth or reproduction of fungi) and works by affecting the microtubular system of fungi, interfering with the mitotic spindle and cytoplasmic microtubules. The recommended pediatric dosage is 10 mg/kg/day for 6-8 weeks, although this may be increased to 20 mg/kg/d for those infected by T. tonsurans, or those who fail {{to respond to the}} initial 6 weeks of treatment. Unlike other fungal skin infections that may be treated with topical therapies like creams applied directly to the afflicted area, griseofulvin must be taken orally to be effective; this allows the drug to penetrate the hair shaft where the fungus lives. The effective therapy rate of this treatment is generally high, in the range of 88-100%.Other oral antifungal treatments for tinea capitis also frequently reported in the literature include terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole; these drugs have the advantage of shorter treatment durations than griseofulvin. However, concern has been raised about the possibility of rare side effects like liver toxicity or interactions with other drugs; furthermore, the newer drug treatments tend to be more expensive than griseofulvin.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluated the}} <b>fungistatic</b> and fungicidal activities of red propolis alcoholic extract (RPAE) against different Candida species isolated from chronic periodontitis cases, and compared with chlorhexidine (CHX). Nineteen samples of Candida species (C. albicans [n = 12], C. tropicalis [n = 5] andC. glabrata[n = 2]) isolated from chronic periodontitis cases were analyzed. The <b>fungistatic</b> and fungicidal activity of both RPAE and CHX were evaluated using fluconazole and C. parapsilosis (ATCC 6258) as a control. <b>Fungistatic</b> activity was analyzed {{based on the}} Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) reference procedure to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations. Fungicidal activity was established according {{to the absence of}} fungal growth on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar medium. The <b>fungistatic</b> and fungicidal activities of RPAE were observed, respectively, at 32 - 64 &# 956;g/mL and 64 - 512 &# 956;g/mL for C. albicans, 64 &# 956;g/mL and 64 - 256 &# 956;g/mL for C. glabrata, and 32 - 64 &# 956;g/mL and 64 µg/mL for C. tropicalis. CHX <b>fungistatic</b> activity was observed at concentrations of 0. 003 - 1. 92 µg/mL for C. albicans, 1. 92 µg/mL for C. glabrata, and 0. 03 - 1. 92 µg/mL for C. tropicalis.

40|$|We {{examined}} in vitro {{interaction between the}} azole antifungal agents itraconazole and ketoconazole and macrophages and their activities against Blastomyces dermatitidis. <b>Fungistatic</b> and fungicidal concentrations for B. dermatitidis in vitro were assessed in a microculture system in which fungistasis was measured as inhibition of multiplication and fungicidal activity was measured as reduction of inoculum CFU. Resident peritoneal murine macrophages, which surround but do not phagocytize the fungus, were not fungicidal for B. dermatitidis isolates but were <b>fungistatic</b> for some isolates studied. Synergy was demonstrated when <b>fungistatic</b> concentrations (e. g., 0. 01 micrograms/ml) of itraconazole, which limited growth 55 % {{compared with that of}} controls, were cocultured with macrophages; this resulted in fungicidal activity (85 % killing) against B. dermatitidis (ATCC 26199) in 72 -h assays. This synergy could occur even if itraconazole was added after the macrophages had surrounded the fungus. Ketoconazole at <b>fungistatic</b> concentrations did not act synergistically with macrophages to kill B. dermatitidis. Lymph node lymphocytes could not substitute for macrophages in synergy with itraconazole to kill B. dermatitidis. When B. dermatitidis was separated by a filter from macrophages in Transwell cultures, fungicidal synergy with itraconazole was less efficient. Pretreatment of B. dermatitidis with itraconazole for 24 h did not render the fungus susceptible to killing by macrophages in the absence of itraconazole, whereas pretreatment of nonfungistatic macrophages with itraconazole rendered them <b>fungistatic</b> in a dose-dependent manner. Three other isolates were killed by otherwise <b>fungistatic</b> concentrations of itraconazole when the isolates were cocultured with macrophages. These findings indicate that one basis for the efficacy of itraconazole versus ketoconazole in treating blastomycosis could be synergy of a <b>fungistatic</b> concentration of itraconazole with macrophages in killing of B. dermatitidis...|$|E

40|$|Human serum, human {{transferrin}} (TF), and {{the iron}} chelator 1, 10 -phenanthroline (OP) produce iron-reversible <b>fungistatic</b> activity {{which has been}} attributed to simple iron deprivation. In this study, the influence {{of the size of the}} inoculum on the inhibitory activity of serum, TF, and OP prepared with the same iron-binding capacity (2. 5 micrograms/ml) for Rhizopus oryzae and Trichophyton mentagrophytes was examined. Inhibition was monitored in liquid microcultures maintained at 37 degrees C and pH 7. 4 to 7. 5 by measuring the change in absorbance density. Increasing the number of spores in the inoculum disrupted the <b>fungistatic</b> activity of serum and TF, but not that of OP. The dilution at which OP lost <b>fungistatic</b> activity was not affected by the number of spores in the inoculum and was the same for both fungi. The dilution at which TF and serum lost <b>fungistatic</b> activity was dependent upon both the quantity of the inoculum and the species of fungus. The number of viable spores, rather than the total number of spores in the inoculum, was determined to be important in overcoming the inhibition of fungal growth by serum and TF. The <b>fungistatic</b> activity of serum and TF could be diminished by the preexposure of the serum to viable but nongrowing spores. Direct and indirect fluorescence studies indicated that both T. mentagrophytes and R. oryzae absorbed TF. Glucose uptake by R. oryzae was inhibited by a 4 -h exposure to 5. 0 to 0. 15 mg of apotransferrin per ml.

40|$|During World War II, {{the number}} of infections caused by the {{dermatophytes}} reached alarming heights in the armed forces. This fact stimulated the search for agents that could not only inhibit the fungi but also kill them. Therefore, in investigating chemotherapeutic agents, both <b>fungistatic</b> and fungicidal activity must be examined, and to accomplish this, standard in vitro methods must be employed that eliminate as many variables as possible. Species and strains must be examined to ascertain if the difference in susceptibility to the agent precludes {{the use of a}} single species or strain of standard resistance for the test organism. The present studies represent an attempt to devise satisfactory methods for <b>fungistatic</b> and fungicidal tests, using the fatty acids as the anti-fungal agent, and to study the relative susceptibilities of several species and strains of fungi to these agents. Peck and Rosenfeld 29 demonstrated the <b>fungistatic</b> action of various fatty acids against Trichophyton gypseum. Keeney and Brayles' 8 investigated the <b>fungistatic</b> and fungicidal action of sodium propionate and pointed out that this salt was <b>fungistatic</b> for both Trichophyton gypseum and Trichophyton purpureum, although at different concentrations, but fungicidal for Trichophyton purpureum alone. In 1941, Cowles ' had demonstrated that as the pH was lowered increased bactericidal action was exhibited by the fatty acids, and that at any fixed pH level the effective concentrations of the series varied according to Traube's rule. Kirby et al. 23 concluded that the disinfecting property of acetic acid against molds was a function of pH.

Opsonization of the yeasts in fresh or heat-inactivated serum was required for PMN-mediated fungistasis, but ingestion of the yeasts was not required. Recognition and phagocytosis of opsonized yeasts was via PMN complement receptor (CR) type 1 (CR 1), CR 3, and FcRIII (CD 16). PMN <b>fungistatic</b> activity was evident by 2 h, was maximum at 24 h, and persisted up to 5 d. In contrast, yeasts multiplied within monocytes {{to a greater extent}} than in culture medium alone.
