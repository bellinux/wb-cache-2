This concept is spurred on by the idea of a Europe promoting its linguistic and cultural diversity. Another summer university is organised with the University of Potsdam and the State University of Belarus since 2011 in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). This Summer University encourages the participants to reflect on the evolution of law within a <b>European</b> <b>legal</b> <b>area</b> in a larger context as it now includes non-EU countries.|$|E
40|$|This article touches {{upon the}} worldview basis of <b>European</b> {{identity}} in <b>legal</b> <b>area.</b> So it explores {{the issue of}} relationship between Western legal tradition and new European culture in the totality of it’s multiform manifestations. Identification of this relationship gives {{us an opportunity to}} understand the character and reasons of the Western Legal Tradition crisis phenomena. It emphasizes the indissoluble connection between those phenomena and the global cultural processes, mainly the collapse of the former world view paradigm and formation of a new value system. The article also introduces a brief review of the development milestones of the 19 th century philosophy, which were indicative of the start of revision of the major premises of the new European world view and the corresponding picture of the world. It is stated that there is an interconnection between those cultural processes and the crisis phenomena in legal consciousness, which started to take effect in the period of study and are thus seen as one of the manifestations of a deeper crisis in the new European world view fundamentals themselves. Besides, the article represents a review of a series of the legal concepts established by Russian authors {{in the first half of}} the 20 th century, with common interest in the problem of legal consciousness during the crisis of <b>European</b> <b>legal</b> tradition...|$|R
40|$|European {{harmonization}} efforts - {{such as a}} European civil code, European constitutional treaties, European principles, and European {{fundamental rights}} - are frequently criticized for building on or creating a <b>European</b> <b>legal</b> culture that does not exist. In reality, {{what we have is}} <b>European</b> <b>legal</b> pluralism. Some have argued that the pluralistic structure of European law hinders the development of a community, which is a necessary requirement for a <b>European</b> <b>legal</b> culture. And, if there can be no common <b>European</b> <b>legal</b> culture, then there is no basis for harmonizing exercises. The contributors to this book explore whether, in fact, the contrary is true. Cultural pluralism might indeed be a distinctive feature of <b>European</b> <b>legal</b> culture. Diversity is not something that is in opposition to a <b>European</b> <b>legal</b> culture, but rather constitutes a new, different understanding of it. The book demonstrates in detail how such an approach - inter alia in the areas of private, corporate, administrative, and constitutional law - furthers the understanding of a developing <b>European</b> <b>legal</b> culture, how it offers theoretical and doctrinal insights, and how it adds critical perspective...|$|R

In this post, I argue about the importance of trust among judges in the European legal system based on recent empirical findings...|$|E

40|$|Although the European Court of Justice {{rendered}} its Weber/ Putz {{judgment as}} long ago as three years, the turmoil since then in both academia and practice has not abated. Indeed, the significance of the ‘proportionality principle’ for European contract law can hardly be overestimated, as the ECJ basically established by this judgment, with or without intent, a doctrine of general strict liability in contract law, which so far has only existed in but a few <b>European</b> <b>legal</b> systems beyond common law. This paper compares the reception of the Weber/Putz decision in a major Western <b>European</b> <b>legal</b> system (Germany) with the approach of a minor Central <b>European</b> <b>legal</b> system (Estonia), also taking into account the judgment’s impact on the future development of European contract law...|$|R

The papers presented are {{at the cutting edge of}} the fields which they address, and reflect the views of recognised experts drawn from the University world, legal practice, and the institutions of both the EU and its Member States. Inclusion of the comparative dimension brings a fresh perspective to the study of European law, and highlights the effects of globalisation of the law more generally, and the resulting cross fertilisation of norms and ideas that has occurred among previously sovereign and separate legal orders.
