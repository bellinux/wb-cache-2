From 1972 to 1974, he was chairman of the Administrative Conference of the United States, a small independent agency that sought to improve the functioning of the federal bureaucracy. In mid-1974, Nixon nominated him as Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel. After Nixon's resignation, the nomination was continued by President Gerald Ford, and Scalia was confirmed by the Senate on August 22, 1974.|$|E

5|$|In this period, one of {{the major}} {{incentives}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> Transylvanian towns was the trade with Wallachia and Moldavia. For instance, Braşov was granted a staple right in 1369 with respect to the trade in cloth from Poland or Germany. Thereafter, foreign merchants had to sell their most sought-after merchandise, broadcloth to the tradesmen of Braşov who resold it in Wallachia in exchange for animals, cotton, wax and honey.|$|E

5|$|Termites can {{be major}} {{agricultural}} pests, particularly in East Africa and North Asia, where crop losses can be severe (3–100% in crop loss in Africa). Counterbalancing {{this is the}} greatly improved water infiltration where termite tunnels in the soil allow rainwater to soak in deeply, which helps reduce runoff and consequent soil erosion through bioturbation. In South America, cultivated plants such as eucalyptus, upland rice and sugarcane can be severely damaged by termite infestations, with attacks on leaves, roots and woody tissue. Termites can also attack other plants, including cassava, coffee, cotton, fruit trees, maize, peanuts, soybeans and vegetables. Mounds can disrupt farming activities, {{making it difficult for}} farmers to operate farming machinery; however, despite farmers' dislike of the mounds, it is often the case that no net loss of production occurs. Termites can be beneficial to agriculture, such as by boosting crop yields and enriching the soil. Termites and ants can re-colonise untilled land that contains crop stubble, which colonies use for nourishment when they establish their nests. The presence of nests in fields enables larger amounts of rainwater to soak into the ground and increases the amount of nitrogen in the soil, both essential <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> crops.|$|E
5|$|The Madras Presidency had {{the highest}} {{literacy}} rate of all the provinces in British India. In 1901, Madras had a male literacy rate of 11.9 percent and a female literacy rate of 0.9 percent. In 1950, when the Madras Presidency became Madras State, the literacy rate was slightly {{higher than the national}} average of 18 percent. In 1901, there were 26,771 public and private institutions with 923,760 scholars of whom 784,621 were male and 139,139 female. By 1947, the number of educational institutions had increased to 37,811 and the number of scholars to 3,989,686. Apart from colleges, in 1947 there were 31,975 public and elementary schools, 720 secondary schools for boys and 4,173 elementary and 181 secondary schools for girls. Most of the early graduates were Brahmins. The preponderance of Brahmins in the universities and in the civic administration {{was one of the main}} causes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> the Anti-Brahmin movement in the presidency. Madras was also the first province in British India where caste-based communal reservations were introduced.|$|E
5|$|The NWOBHM {{triggered}} a renaissance in a stagnant rock genre, but took on heavy criticism for the excessive local media hype surrounding {{a legion of}} typically mediocre musicians. Detractors think that, unlike heavy metal of the preceding decades, their music was unoriginal and included no classic rock recordings. Nevertheless, these bands and their diverse output offered a blueprint that counterparts across the Western world would later emulate and expand. The collision of styles that characterised the NWOBHM {{is now seen as}} key to the diversification of heavy metal {{in the second half of}} the 1980s into various subgenres that came to the fore in the 1990s. The stardom of Def Leppard in the US provided a catalyst <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> glam metal, just as bands like Angel Witch, Witchfynde, Cloven Hoof and especially Venom generated the music, lyrics, cover art and attitude that sparked black metal in its various forms in Europe and America. Motörhead, Iron Maiden, Raven, Tank, Venom and other minor groups are viewed as precursors of speed metal and thrash metal, two subgenres which carried forward the crossover with punk, incorporating elements of hardcore while amplifying volume, velocity and aggressive tone.|$|E

5|$|The advent in {{the mid-1990s}} of ’no-frills’ carriers, such as easyJet, has had a {{significant}} impact on air travel in the UK. In 2005 these airlines carried 77.5million passengers, up from just 4.3million in 1996. They are responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> regional airports, operating from 35 airports in 2006 compared to 10 in 1996, and increasing the choice of international destinations, serving 150 in 2006, compared to 12 a decade earlier. The annual rate of growth in the overall demand for air travel has remained stable since 1975, averaging 5.8 per cent annually. Recent growth is being serviced by the no-frills airlines at the expense of traditional carriers which, since 2000, have experienced flat or declining traffic levels. In response, traditional carriers have lowered costs to compete more effectively on price, leading to lower prices on the short haul routes serviced by this sector, especially in business fares. They have also limited or reduced capacity and in some cases launched no-frills subsidiaries of their own.|$|E
