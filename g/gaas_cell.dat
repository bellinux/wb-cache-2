40|$|Nearly perfect photon {{recycling}} helped <b>GaAs</b> <b>cells</b> {{achieve the}} highest efficiency ever reported for a solar cell. Recent reports of photon recycling in perovskite solar cells suggest that, once optimized, it {{may as well}} achieve GaAs-like performance. In this paper, we show that <b>GaAs</b> and perovskite <b>cells</b> recycle photons in different ways. First, although bare-perovskite {{has been shown to}} have lifetimes (~ 1 us) in the radiative limit, non-radiative recombination at the transport layers restricts the solar cell operation far below the "photon-recycling" regime. <b>GaAs</b> <b>cells</b> have no such limitation. Second, even if the transport layers were optically and electrically perfect, the poor mobility of the perovskite layer would still restrict the optimum thickness ~ 1 um. Thus, a very high quality mirror (reflectivity > 96 %) is required to utilize photon-recycling. The mirror reflectivity restriction was far more relaxed for the thicker (~ 2 - 3 um) <b>GaAs</b> <b>cells.</b> Therefore, a nontrivial co-optimization of device geometry, mirror reflectivity, and material choice is necessary for achieving highest theoretical efficiency anticipated for perovskite cells.
