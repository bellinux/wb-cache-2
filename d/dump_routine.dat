50|$|The APEXC is an {{incredibly}} simple machine.Instruction and data words are always 32 bits long. The processor uses integer arithmetic with 2's complement representation. Addresses are 10 bits long. The APEXC has no RAM, except for a 32-bit accumulator and a 32-bit data register (used along with the 32-bit accumulator to implement 64-bit shift instructions and hold the 64-bit result of a multiplication). Instructions and data are stored in two magnetic drums, {{for a total of}} 32 circular magnetic tracks of 32 words. Since the rotation rate is 3750rpm (62.5 rotations per second), the program execution speed can go from as high as the theoretical maximum of 1 kIPS to lower than 100IPS if program instructions and data are not contiguous. Nowadays, many say a pocket calculator is faster.One oddity {{is that there is no}} program counter: each machine instruction includes the address of the next instruction. This design may sound weird, but it is the only way to achieve optimal performance with this cylinder-based memory.The machine code is made of 15 instructions only, namely addition, subtraction, multiplication, load (3 variants), store (2 variants), conditional branch, right arithmetic bit shift, right bit rotation, punched-card input, punched-card output, machine stop, and bank-switching (which is never used on the APEXC, since it only has 1024 words of storage, and addresses are 10-bit-long). A so-called vector mode enables to repeat the same operation 32 times with 32 successive memory locations. Note the lack of bitwise and/or/xor and division. Also, note the lack of indirect addressing modes: dynamic modification of opcodes is the only way one may simulate it.Another oddity is that the memory bus and the ALU are 1-bit-wide. There is a 64 kHz bit-clock and a 2 kHz word-clock, and each word memory and arithmetic operation is decomposed into 32 1-bit memory and arithmetic operations: this takes 32 bit cycles, for a total of 1 word cycle.The processor is fairly efficient: most instructions take only 2 word cycles (1 for fetch, 1 for read operand and execute), with the exception of stores, shifts and multiplications. The APEXC CPU qualifies as RISC; there is no other adequate word.Note there is no read-only memory (ROM), and therefore no bootstrap loader or default start-up program whatsoever. It is believed that no executive or operating system was ever written for the APEXC, although there were subroutine libraries of sorts for common arithmetic, I/O and debug tasks. Operation of the machine is normally done through a control panel which allows the user to start, stop and resume the central processing unit, and to alter registers and memory when the CPU is stopped. When starting the machine, the address of the first instruction of the program to be executed must be entered in the control panel, then the run switch must be pressed. Most programs end with a stop instruction, which enables the operator to check the state of the machine, possibly run some post-mortem debugging procedures (a core <b>dump</b> <b>routine</b> is described in an APEXC programming book), then enter the address of another program and run it.Two I/O devices were supported: a paper tape reader, and a paper tape puncher. The puncher output could be fed to a printer ('teletyper') unit when desirable. Printer output is emulated and is displayed on screen. Tape input was either computer-generated by the APEXC, or hand-typed with a special 32-key keyboard (each tape row had 5 data holes (<-> bits), which makes 32 differentvalues).|$|E
40|$|SEDSTAT is an {{interactive}} computer program for processing and presentation of grain size data. The program utilizes graphic and moment methods for {{the calculation of}} grain size statistical parameters. The program has a menu driven format {{that can be easily}} understood by anyone with little, or no computer experience. Data storage and retrieval are the major features of SEDST AT. Another important feature of the program is the built in editor that prompts the user to enter and edit the unprocessed data of weight retained on each sieve and the sieve mesh size in Phi units. The program starts with receiving data from the keyboard or a disk data file; it then calculates the weight percentage, and cumulative weight percentage retained on each sieve. The gaussian (probability) interpolations and extrapolations are then performed to obtain the requisite critical percentiles that are used to calculate Folk and Ward graphical statistical parameters. Grouped moment statistical parameters are also calculated. Another function of the program is to construct two graphs; the first is a histogram of class weight percentage versus size class interval and the second is a probability plot of cumulative weight percentage versus size class interval. Below both of these graphs the parameters of grain size statistics are printed. A hard copy of the graphs may be obtained using a graphic printer or a screen <b>dumping</b> <b>routine...</b>|$|R
50|$|November 1960, through June 1961, the Calhoun County {{was engaged}} in <b>routine</b> <b>dumping</b> {{operations}} from Boston to Charleston. She was decommissioned 1 November 1962 after eighteen-and-a-half years of Naval service. Only one other LST of World War II class was in continuous commission longer than the LST-519. Her final duty was as a gunnery target for several warships. However, gunfire failed to sink her, so demolition charges were used {{to carry out the}} coup de gr√¢ce.|$|R
5000|$|Buoyed {{by rising}} {{sanitation}} standards and a push {{to clean up}} Pittsburgh after World War II, the Pennsylvania Sanitary Water Board ordered Pittsburgh and surrounding communities to end these practices. So Allegheny County founded the Allegheny County Sanitary Authority, or Alcosan, in the 1940s. [...] Financing the system was a major hurdle involving squabbles between Pittsburgh and surrounding communities. This hurdle was cleared when Alcosan secured a four-year loan of $100 million, the largest for sewage treatment in American history, in 1955. [...] The <b>routine</b> <b>dumping</b> of raw sewage into area rivers ceased in 1959, when Alcosan began operations.|$|R

It was not until 1998s Anutha Zone that he again concentrated on this aspect of his music wholly for a full album. [...] "After we cut the new record", he wrote, [...] "I decided Id had enough of the mighty-coo-de-fiyo hoodoo show, so I <b>dumped</b> the Gris-Gris <b>routine</b> we had been touring with since 1967 and worked up a new act - a Mardi Gras revue featuring the New Orleans standards we had covered in Gumbo." ...|$|R
