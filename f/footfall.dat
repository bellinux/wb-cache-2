A report in 2001 showed approximately 3,000 people commuted daily from Castle Point to the city via Fenchurch Street, while a 2013 report {{said it was the}} busiest station on the LTSR route, with 46,000 daily peak-time passengers.|$|E
5|$|The Kerry Bog Pony is a {{mountain}} and moorland breed of pony that originated in Ireland. Possibly {{descended from the}} Irish Hobby horse, it originally lived a mainly feral existence in the peat bogs {{of what is now}} County Kerry in southwestern Ireland. Local inhabitants used the ponies as pack and cart horses for transporting peat and kelp to the villages. The breed developed physical characteristics including a low weight-to-height ratio and an unusual <b>footfall</b> pattern, which helped it move on soft ground such as peat bogs. The ponies were known for hardiness and an ability to survive in harsh conditions.|$|E
5|$|Saddlebreds are {{popularly known}} as show horses, with horses being shown saddle seat in both three-gaited and five-gaited classes. The former are the three common gaits seen in most breeds, the walk, trot and canter. The latter {{includes}} the three regular gaits, plus two four-beat ambling gaits known as the slow gait and the rack. The slow gait today is a four-beat gait in which the lateral pairs of legs leave the ground together, but strike the ground at different times, the hind foot connecting slightly before the forefoot. In the show ring, the gait should be performed with restraint and precision. The rack is also a four-beat gait, but with equal intervals between each <b>footfall,</b> making it a smooth gait to ride. In the show ring, the gait is performed with speed and action, appearing unrestrained. Historically, the slow gait could be either a running walk, the stepping pace, or the fox trot, however, the modern five-gaited Saddlebred usually performs the stepping pace.|$|E
40|$|Human <b>footfalls</b> are {{the main}} source of {{vibration}} in office building and it could affect the structure of the building as well as causing discomfort and annoyance to the occupants of the building when the vibration level inside the building exceeds the recommended level. The objectives of the study are to determine the level of vibration on each floor of a multi-story building due to <b>footfalls</b> and to perform structural response on the multi-story building due to <b>footfalls</b> input. The selected building for this study is Registrar Office building located in Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM). The scope of study is focused on the effect of vibration induced by <b>footfalls</b> on multi-storey building and analysing the data using MATLAB and ANSYSv 14. The real inputs of vibration induced by <b>footfalls</b> were measured and obtained using Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV). The vibration level induced by <b>footfalls</b> on the multi-story office building can be determined using Vibration Criteria (VC) guidelines by Amick et, al. (2000). Finally, from the study, the vibration level achieved for this Registrar Office building is at ISO level which is still under the acceptable limit for office building...|$|R
40|$|Vibration in {{buildings}} is a disturbance caused by activities {{from the surrounding}} area. It comes both from external and internal sources. This phenomenon can affect electronic equipment such as computers, and the comfort of building occupants especially in offices and residential buildings. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the vibration criteria of multi-storey building floor due to vibration from <b>footfalls</b> and passing vehicles. The first objective of this study is to determine the vibration response level on the office building due to ground vibration from vehicles and <b>footfalls.</b> Second is to model the Registrar Office building structure and investigate fundamental frequency and mode shape. Third is to analyse and compare the vibration criteria of the building from both vehicles and <b>footfalls.</b> Registrar office building in UTHM was chosen in this study as it is multi-storey building that serves as an administration building and is exposed to internal and external vibration. Laser Doppler Vibrometer was used in field measurement to obtain the vibration response from loaded passenger and <b>footfalls.</b> For <b>footfalls,</b> one people, three people and five people included vibration were measured to observe the difference in vibration response. Ansys was used to model the building based on the parameters obtained from the original structural plan. ModalV and VSATs programs in Matlab were used to obtain the floor vibration criteria due to the vibration response. The floor response caused by vibration generated by passenger bus is in VC-E range. For human <b>footfalls,</b> the response is in VC-C, VC-A and ISO range for the three different cases. In conclusion, the vibration response from passing vehicles and <b>footfalls</b> does not exceed the recommended criteria. However, there is a risk that <b>footfalls</b> may have an effect when more people walk on the same floor panel as shown in the result, where there is a significant increase in response due to increase number of human <b>footfalls...</b>|$|R

25|$|Preparation and Timing: The rider {{prepares for}} the {{transition}} by using half-halts to balance the horse, and bends him slightly in the intended direction. Since the first <b>footfall</b> of the canter is the outside hind leg, the rider times the aids {{to ask for the}} canter when the outside hind leg is engaged (i.e. under the body). So, at the trot the rider would ask when the inside front leg touches the ground (its shoulder will be forward). At the walk, the rider will ask when the outside shoulder starts to move back.|$|E
