5|$|Some Muslims {{are also}} opposed to men having long hair {{as it is}} also {{important}} in Islam to have clear differences (in appearance) between sexes. And generally these cultures encourage women to have long hair and men to have short <b>hair.</b> <b>The</b> Taliban in Afghanistan viewed long hair for men as a western influence, and punished it by arrest and forced haircuts, although this would be a direct contradiction of the sunnah of the Prophet. Similar measures have been taken by Islamists in Iraq. In spite of this, several Taliban affiliated members of the Mehsud clan are recognisable by their long <b>hair.</b> <b>The</b> Saudi Islamist fighter Amir Khattab was also notable for his long hair. Dervishes of some Sufi orders, such as the Kasnazani, often have long hair and whirl it around during rituals.|$|E

5|$|Dugan {{designed}} {{sound for}} three regional productions of <b>Hair,</b> <b>the</b> musical: ones in Chicago, Las Vegas and Toronto. The Chicago production ran in 1969 and 1970 at the Blackstone Theatre, operated {{at that time}} by The Shubert Organization. Dugan was able to design sound but not allowed to operate the mixing console {{because he was not}} in the stagehands union: International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE).|$|E
50|$|Shampoo and {{conditioner}} {{forms of}} the volumizers are used just like ordinary shampoo or conditioners. The spray and lotion form of volumizers are used on damp <b>hair</b> near <b>the</b> roots of <b>the</b> <b>hair.</b> In order to use a <b>hair</b> volumizer, <b>the</b> person using the product must flip their head downward and gradually blow dry <b>the</b> <b>hair,</b> with <b>the</b> air being blown along the shaft of <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> until <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> is dry. Drying <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> in this position will increase volume and achieve the desired effect.|$|R
50|$|Underarm hair, {{also known}} as {{axillary}} <b>hair,</b> is <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> in <b>the</b> underarm area (axilla).|$|R
25|$|On <b>the</b> scalp, <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> {{is usually}} {{known to be}} lost around <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> line, leaving <b>the</b> densest amount of <b>hair</b> at <b>the</b> crown. Small vellus hair will often replace <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> that is lost.|$|R
5|$|Male {{and female}} guinea pigs {{do not differ}} in {{external}} appearance apart from general size. The position of the anus {{is very close to}} the genitals in both sexes. Female genitals are distinguished by a Y-shaped configuration formed from a vulvar flap, while the male genitals may look similar, with the penis and anus forming a like shape, the penis will protrude if pressure is applied to the surrounding <b>hair.</b> <b>The</b> male's testes may also be visible externally from scrotal swelling.|$|E
5|$|Many metal musicians when {{performing}} live {{engage in}} headbanging, which involves rhythmically beating {{time with the}} head, often emphasized by long <b>hair.</b> <b>The</b> il cornuto, or devil horns, hand gesture was popularized by vocalist Ronnie James Dio while with Black Sabbath and Dio. Although Gene Simmons of Kiss claims {{to have been the}} first to make the gesture on the 1977 Love Gun album cover, there is speculation as to who started the phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|The Muisca, as the {{indigenous}} {{groups in the}} west of Colombia, developed a variety of textiles from fique or cotton. Cords were made of fique or human <b>hair.</b> <b>The</b> people of the cold climate Altiplano {{did not have a}} major cotton production, yet traded most of their cotton with their neighbours; the Muzo in the west, Panche in the southwest, Guane in the northwest, and the Guayupe in the east. From the raw cotton, the Muisca women made fine cotton mantles that were traded on the many markets in the Muisca territory.|$|E
50|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> is cut, wet <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> {{by taking}} a shower. Then take a towel and dry <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> by rubbing <b>the</b> towel vigorously until <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> is mostly dry (it should still be {{somewhat}} wet) and stands up. Put a hat on forwards (backwards does not usually work as well) and blow dry <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> until <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> is flipped up as desired. To maintain it, hairspray may be used, although if <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> is short enough, it {{should be able to}} stay flipped up by itself.|$|R
50|$|Trictenotoma grayi is {{a species}} of beetle and the only {{representative}} of the family Trictenotomidae from southern India. They can be easily mistaken for cerambycid beetles but the antennae arising from a notch {{in front of the}} eye give away the family.The head and thorax are black and covered by fine ochre coloured <b>hairs.</b> <b>The</b> thorax has two raised spots that lack <b>the</b> <b>hairs.</b> <b>The</b> body underneath is clothed in whitish <b>hairs.</b> <b>The</b> mandibles point forward and the tips cross at rest while the teeth interlock.|$|R
50|$|Chemical {{alteration}} of <b>hair</b> only affects <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> above <b>the</b> scalp; unless <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> roots are damaged, new hair will grow in with natural color and texture.|$|R
5|$|The iconographical {{attributes}} of Shiva are the serpent around his neck, the adorning crescent moon, the holy river Ganga flowing from his matted <b>hair,</b> <b>the</b> third eye on his forehead, the trishula as his weapon and the damaru. He is usually worshipped in the aniconic form of Lingam. Shiva is a pan-Hindu deity, revered widely by Hindus, in India, Nepal and Sri Lanka.|$|E
5|$|The nest {{is usually}} {{placed on a}} {{horizontal}} tree branch or in a shrub, a few metres above the ground. The nest is an open cup constructed of grass stalks and other fibres, and lined with feathers and <b>hair.</b> <b>The</b> female lays three to five pinkish eggs with brown dots from May to July. Incubation and fledging periods are unknown. This species has been recorded giving a distraction display, pretending to be injured to distract predators from its nest. Both parents feed the young, though the female may do so more frequently.|$|E
5|$|A further {{internal}} diagonal {{passes through}} the space occupied by the Infanta. There is a similar connection between the female dwarf and the figure of Velázquez himself, both of whom look towards the viewer from similar angles, creating a visual tension. The face of Velázquez is dimly lit by light that is reflected, rather than direct. For this reason his features, though not as sharply defined, are more visible {{than those of the}} dwarf who is much nearer the light source. This appearance of a total face, full-on to the viewer, draws the attention, and its importance is marked, tonally, by the contrasting frame of dark <b>hair,</b> <b>the</b> light on the hand and brush, and the skilfully placed triangle of light on the artist's sleeve, pointing directly to the face.|$|E
50|$|The queen is 1.7 to 2.1 {{centimeter}}s {{long and}} just under a centimeter wide at the abdomen. It is mostly black with areas of pale <b>hairs.</b> <b>The</b> worker female is 1.2 to 1.4 centimeters long {{and half a}} centimeter wide. It is hairier than the queen and has more yellow <b>hairs.</b> <b>The</b> abdomen is black and yellow. The male is {{the same size as}} the worker. The mandibles have reddish tips. It has white <b>hairs</b> on <b>the</b> head and legs and yellow and white <b>hairs</b> on <b>the</b> thorax.|$|R
2500|$|All {{parts of}} the plant are covered in an indumentum of very dense brown <b>hairs.</b> <b>The</b> stem has a velvety coating of dense, coarse, brown, {{spreading}} hairs. These hairs are up to 2mm long, some being shorter and branched, others longer and unbranched. A similar, though longer and much denser, covering of hairs exists on younger {{parts of the}} stem and near the , on the underside and top of the , and on the undeveloped pitchers. The underside of the leaves is densely [...] and bears short branched and longer unbranched, softer <b>hairs.</b> <b>The</b> upper surface is also densely hirsute, but has short, simple, whitish <b>hairs.</b> <b>The</b> peduncle and axis are entirely covered in an indumentum of red-brown <b>hairs.</b> <b>The</b> partial peduncles, sepals, and staminal column bear short, crisp hairs.|$|R
50|$|Washing <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> {{cleansed}} it of the styling products {{but also}} exposed {{the damage done}} to <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> by <b>the</b> chemical process. As <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> grew out, <b>the</b> wearer would be required to touch up <b>the</b> new <b>hair</b> growth, further adding to the overall expense.|$|R
5|$|David is revived {{and walks}} to the frozen Fairy statue, which collapses when he touches it. The Mecha use David’s {{memories}} to reconstruct the Swinton home and explain to him that they cannot make him human. However, David insists that they recreate Monica from DNA in the lock of <b>hair.</b> <b>The</b> Mecha warn David that the clone can only live for a day, and that the process cannot be repeated. David spends the next day with Monica and Teddy. Before she drifts off to sleep, Monica tells David she has always loved him. Teddy climbs onto the bed and watches the two lie peacefully together.|$|E
5|$|Dunga {{anonymously}} reveals to Kika {{that her}} husband is cheating on her, thinking that if he can destroy their marriage, then he and Wellington can become lovers. Kika finds Wellington and Dayse together, attacks them, and then leaves for good. Wellington goes to the Texas Hotel to seek solace. Dunga wants to take Wellington up to his room, but Wellington is {{put off by the}} funeral of the recently deceased owner of the hotel. Meanwhile, Isaac is thrown out of the bar after trying to forcibly grab Lígia. He is then seen driving his car and when he meets Kika, he takes her to his apartment and they have sex. As the film concludes, Lígia is shown again complaining about her routine. This is followed by a montage of everyday city life, ending with Kika deciding to dye her <b>hair</b> <b>the</b> same shade that made Isaac so attracted to Lígia.|$|E
5|$|Humans, horses, and orangutans {{are among}} the few species that may grow their head hair very long. Humans are {{believed}} to have lost their fur 2.5–3 million years ago as hominids when transitioning from a forest habitat to the open savanna, as an effect of natural selection, since this development made it possible to run fast and hunt animals close to the equator without getting overheated. An exception was however head hair, which was kept to provide thermal insulation of the scalp from the sun, to protect against ultra-violet radiation exposure, and also to provide cooling (when sweat evaporates from soaked <b>hair).</b> <b>The</b> ability to grow straight hair, has been observed among Homo sapiens sub-groups in less sunny regions further away from the equator. Relative to kinky Afro-textured hair, straight hair allows more UV light to pass to the scalp (which is essential for the production of vitamin D, that is important for bone development).|$|E
5000|$|The frat shag is a hair style {{associated}} with {{college students in}} the Southern United States, in which <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> extends to <b>the</b> eyebrows and past the ears of an individual. The haircut is generally accomplished by initially fading {{up the sides of}} the head, and then thinning out <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> on <b>the</b> top of the head. Over time, <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> on <b>the</b> sides of the head will grow faster than the top and will cover <b>the</b> ears. <b>The</b> <b>hair</b> on <b>the</b> top of the head can be combed over in order to retain the conservative look of the hairstyle. [...] To be considered a true frat shag, <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> must not contain any styling products. On specific occasions (such as a formal), <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> may be blow-dried and combed in one direction.|$|R
25|$|Another {{mechanism}} {{involves a}} change in <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> cycle. There are three stages of <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> cycle: <b>the</b> anagen phase (<b>hair</b> growth), <b>the</b> catagen phase (<b>hair</b> follicle death), and <b>the</b> telogen phase (<b>hair</b> shedding). If <b>the</b> anagen phase increases beyond what is normal; that region of the body will experience excessive hair growth.|$|R
50|$|The queen is 2.1 to 2.3 {{centimeter}}s {{long and}} about a centimeter wide at the abdomen. Its head and face are black with scattered yellow <b>hairs.</b> <b>The</b> thorax is coated in yellow <b>hairs.</b> <b>The</b> abdomen is yellow banded with black, with a black posterior and black ventral surface. The legs are black.|$|R
5|$|Mosaicism in horses {{is thought}} to account for some {{spontaneous}} occurrences of white, near-white, spotted, and roan horses. Mosaicism refers to mutations that occur after the single-cell stage, and therefore affect {{only a portion of}} the adult cells. Mosaicism may be one possible cause for the rare occurrence of brindle coloring in horses. Mosaic-white horses would be visually indistinguishable from dominant whites. Mosaicism could produce white or partially white foals if a stem cell in the developing foal underwent a mutation, or change to the DNA, that resulted in unpigmented skin and <b>hair.</b> <b>The</b> cells that descend from the affected stem cell will exhibit the mutation, {{while the rest of the}} cells are unaffected.|$|E
5|$|Spielberg wanted Donovan's death {{shown in}} one shot, {{so it would}} not look like an actor having makeup applied between takes. Inflatable pads were applied to Julian Glover's {{forehead}} and cheeks that made his eyes seem to recede during the character's initial decomposition, {{as well as a}} mechanical wig that grew his <b>hair.</b> <b>The</b> shot of Donovan's death was created over three months by morphing together three puppets of Donovan in separate stages of decay, a technique ILM mastered on Willow (1988). A fourth puppet was used for the decaying clothes, because the puppet's torso mechanics had been exposed. Complications arose because Alison Doody's double had not been filmed for the scene's latter two elements, so the background and hair from the first shot had to be used throughout, with the other faces mapped over it. Donovan's skeleton was hung on wires like a marionette; it required several takes to film it crashing against the wall because not all the pieces released upon impact.|$|E
5|$|The Westlake Street set {{was shot}} at 20th Century Fox Studios. Filming was {{eventually}} completed on January 6, 1938 with the scenes outside Mr. Peabody's house. RKO producers expressed concerns about the film's delays and expense, coming 40 days over schedule and $330,000 over budget, and also disliked Grant's glasses and Hepburn's <b>hair.</b> <b>The</b> film's final cost was $1,096,796.23, primarily due to overtime clauses in Hawks', Grant's and Hepburn's contracts. The film's cost for sets and props was only $5,000 over budget, but all actors (including Nissa and Skippy) were paid approximately double their initial salaries. Hepburn's salary rose from $72,500 to $121,680.50, Grant's salary from $75,000 to $123,437.50 and Hawks' salary from $88,046.25 to $202,500. The director received an additional $40,000 to terminate his RKO contract on March 21, 1938.|$|E

5|$|The {{film has}} {{gathered}} various awards and nominations following its release, with most nominations recognising the film {{itself and the}} cast's acting performances, particularly those of Michelle Williams and Kenneth Branagh (who plays Laurence Olivier). Both actors received nominations at the 84th Academy Awards for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor, respectively. The actors also received nominations from the Alliance of Women Film Journalists, while the film was nominated for Best Picture at the African-American Film Critics Association. My Week with Marilyn received four nominations from the Broadcast Film Critics Association, with two nominations coming in the Best Costume Design and Best Makeup categories. The British Academy Film Awards handed the film seven nominations, including Best British Film, Best Actress for Williams, Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Judi Dench, Best Costume Design and Best Makeup and <b>Hair.</b> <b>The</b> cast received the Capri Ensemble Cast Award from the Capri, Hollywood International Film Festival in January 2012.|$|E
5|$|The male half wears a jata-mukuta (a headdress formed of piled, matted hair) on his head, {{adorned with}} a {{crescent}} moon. Sometimes the jata-mukuta is adorned with serpents and the river goddess Ganga flowing through the <b>hair.</b> <b>The</b> right ear wears a nakra-kundala, sarpa-kundala ("serpent-earring") or ordinary kundala ("earring"). Sometimes, the male eye is depicted smaller than the female one and a half-moustache is also seen. A half third eye (trinetra) is prescribed on the male side of the forehead in the canons; a full eye may also be depicted in middle of forehead separated by both the sides or a half eye may be shown above or below Parvati's round dot.

5|$|A dun-colored {{coat with}} {{primitive}} markings {{that include a}} dorsal stripe and often leg striping and transverse shoulder stripes reflect the wildtype coat and are observed in most wild extant equine species. Only the mountain zebra lacks a dorsal stripe. In domestic horses, dun color and primitive markings exist in some animals across many breeds. The purpose of the bold black-and-white striping of zebras has been a subject of debate among biologists for over a century, but recent (2014) evidence supports the theory {{that they are a}} form of protection from biting flies. These insects appear to be less attracted to striped coats and, compared to other wild equines, zebras live in areas with the highest fly activity. With the exception of the domestic horses, which have long manes that lay over the neck and long tail hair growing {{from the top of the}} tailhead or dock, most equines have erect manes and long tails ending in a tuft of <b>hair.</b> <b>The</b> coats of some equine species undergo shedding in certain parts of their range and are thick in the winter.|$|E
