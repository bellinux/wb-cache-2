40|$|Existing {{evidence}} suggests that preferences are affected by whether a price is presented as one allinclusive expense or partitioned {{into a series of}} charges. To explain this phenomenon, we propose a simple psychological mechanism whereby price <b>format</b> determines <b>how</b> <b>many</b> product attributes are actively processed at the time of valuation. Three studies support the hypothesis that price partitioning acts as an incentive to process multiple product dimensions. This process sometimes leads to the paradoxical overweighting of minor (but easy to evaluate) attributes that would be overlooked under an all-inclusive price format. The effect of price partitioning on demand can be detrimental or beneficial, consistent with existing conflicting findings in the literature and with variance in practice. Beyond its predictive and prescriptive implications, this theory contributes to the general notion that pricing might affect as much as capture perceived value...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: At present, {{more and}} more data are {{expressed}} in the <b>form</b> of XML <b>format,</b> <b>how</b> to manage these data efficiently becomes an important issue. To {{solve the problems of}} large encoded data storage space, data update and low query effi-ciency, we propose a new encoding scheme named SDUE (Supporting Data Update Efficiently). We tried to decompose the encoding node location information, avoiding recording redundant information, thus effectively saves storage space; moreover, SDUE also effectively support data updates. In the area of query, since record-taking point SDUE path infor-mation encoded {{in the path of the}} query, which avoided the structural join operations, query efficiency has been improved efficiently. Experimental results show that compared with other coding, SDUE coded has obvious advantages such as storage space utilization, efficiency query and nodes update speed...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} highly cited {{documents}} on Google Scholar (GS) {{has never been}} addressed to date in a comprehensive manner. The objective of this work is to identify the set of highly cited documents in Google Scholar and define their core characteristics: their languages, their file <b>format,</b> or <b>how</b> <b>many</b> {{of them can be}} accessed free of charge. We will also try to answer some additional questions that hopefully shed some light about the use of GS as a tool for assessing scientific impact through citations. The decalogue of research questions is shown below: 1. Which are the most cited documents in GS? 2. Which are the most cited document types in GS? 3. What languages are the most cited documents written in GS? 4. <b>How</b> <b>many</b> highly cited documents are freely accessible? 4. 1 What file types are the most commonly used to store these highly cited documents? 4. 2 Which are the main providers of these documents? 5. <b>How</b> <b>many</b> of the highly cited documents indexed by GS are also indexed by WoS? 6. Is there a correlation between the number of citations that these highly cited documents have received in GS and the number of citations they have received in WoS? 7. <b>How</b> <b>many</b> versions of these highly cited documents has GS detected? 8. Is there a correlation between the number of versions GS has detected for these documents, and the number citations they have received? 9. Is there a correlation between the number of versions GS has detected for these documents, and their position in the search engine result pages? 10. Is there some relation between the positions these documents occupy in the search engine result pages, and the number of citations they have received?Comment: Full raw data available at: [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Variable {{compliance}} with prescribed drug regimens {{is a leading}} source of variability in drug response. Specifics differ by drug and disease. The role of variable compliance was clearly defined in 2 trials of lipid-lowering agents, cholestyramine and gemfibrozil, in which exceptionally careful measurements of compliance were made, {{which has not been}} done in later trials. Economic consequences of variable compliance are estimated by converting dose-dependent changes in absolute risk of incident coronary disease into the unicohort <b>format,</b> which designates <b>how</b> <b>many</b> patients must be treated to prevent, in a given time, a defined `coronary event'. Two strong influences on the costs of treatment are: 1. the shape of the relation between drug intake and risk reduction; and 2. the strength of the linkage between intake and prescription refills. The intake-effect relation for cholestyramine is linear, making compliance-neutral the cost to prevent 1 coronary event, provided that refills match intake. If refills exceed intake, treatment costs rise. The intake-effect relation for gemfibrozil is more typically nonlinear, so poorer compliers purchase and take the drug in amounts that have little benefit, increasing the cost to prevent 1 coronary event. If refills run at a higher rate than intake, costs increase still further. A key question for future study is: do policies that encourage timely refills increase compliance enough to offset their potential to waste money in the purchasing of an untaken drug?Pharmacoeconomics, Patient-compliance, Prescribing, Cost-effectiveness, Reviews-on-treatment, Gemfibrozil, Coronary-disorders, Cholestyramine, Hypercholesterolaemia, Antihyperlipidaemics...|$|R
