40|$|AbstractDry {{machining}} {{is gaining}} {{more and more}} importance in today's manufacturing science because of health hazards imposed {{by the use of}} coolants while machining. This paper presents a detailed analysis of surface topology in dry machining of EN- 8 steel which is widely used material for general-purpose axles, shafts, <b>gears,</b> <b>bolts</b> and studs. Regression models are developed for Ra, Rq, and Rz parameters of surface topology which are very significant parameters from contact stiffness, fatigue strength and surface wear point of view. For all the regression models a good correlation is found between surface roughness and cutting parameters and hence these models can be used to predict the surface roughness within the range of cutting parameters under investigation. Regression models are compared with experimental values of roughness and with available geometrical models. Percent errors are also calculated by comparing regression models and experimental values and a geometrical model. It is found that the percent errors are very small for regression model as compared to geometrical model. Finaly performance of dry machining is compared with that of machining with coolant, no significant difference is found for the surface roughness with the dry machining and that of machining with coolant...|$|R

50|$|The gearbox {{of the car}} {{was also}} novel, having dual {{epicyclic}} <b>gears</b> and being <b>bolted</b> directly to the engine. This allowed four speeds, with direct drive in top gear. All the gears were helical, and enclosed in an oil bath, making for very silent transmission. Reverse gear was built into the rear axle, as was the foot operated brake drum, all of which was housed in a substantial aluminium casing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{overdrive}} {{consists of}} an electrically or hydraulically operated epicyclic <b>gear</b> train <b>bolted</b> behind the transmission unit. It can either couple the input driveshaft directly to the output shaft (or propeller shaft) (1:1), or increase the output speed so that it turns faster than the input shaft (1:1 + n). Thus the output shaft may be [...] "overdriven" [...] relative to the input shaft. In newer transmissions, the overdrive speed(s) are typically {{as a result of}} combinations of planetary/epicyclic gearsets which are integrated in the transmission. In these cases, there is no separately identifiable [...] "overdrive" [...] unit. In older vehicles, it is sometimes actuated by a knob or button, often incorporated into the gearshift knob, and does not require operation of the clutch. Newer vehicles have electronic overdrive in which the computer automatically adjusts to the conditions of power need and load.|$|R

Another difference is the <b>geared</b> lever and <b>bolt</b> design that can accommodate high-pressure modern magnum rounds. Another notable feature is that the trigger moves with the lever when it is operated, which prevents the shooter's trigger finger from being pinched between the lever and the stock when the lever is closed.|$|R

Modern traditional climbs only occasionally have fixed <b>gear</b> (pitons or <b>bolts),</b> except in the case where cracks are lacking to place adequate removable gear. It is also considered bad style to install new protection bolts or pitons on existing climbs that can be completed without them.|$|R
40|$|In coal mines, bolt {{loosening}} in {{the cage}} guide {{is affected by the}} harsh environmental factors and cage hoist vibration, leading to significant threats to work safety. It is crucial, to this effect, to successfully detect the status of multipoint bolts of guide structures. This paper proposes a system to monitor bolt status in harsh environments established based on the RFID technique. A proof-of-concept model was demonstrated consisting of a <b>bolt</b> <b>gearing</b> system, passive UHF RFID tags, a reader, and monitoring software. A tinfoil metal film is fixed on the retaining plate and an RFID tag bonded to a large <b>gear,</b> with the <b>bolt</b> to be detected fixed {{in the center of a}} smaller gear. The radio-frequency signal cannot be received by the reader if the tag is completely obscured by the tinfoil, and if the bolt is loose, the tag’s antenna is exposed when the gear revolves. A radio-frequency signal that carries corresponding bolt’s information is transmitted by the RFID tag to the RFID reader due to coil coupling, identifying loose bolt location and reporting them in the software. Confirmatory test results revealed that the system indeed successfully detects bolt loosening and comparative test results (based on a reed switch multipoint bolt loosening monitor system) provided valuable information regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed system...|$|R
5000|$|Both climber and belayer {{attach the}} rope to their {{climbing}} harnesses. The rope is tied into the climber's harness with a figure-of-eight loop or double bowline knot. The leader either places their own protection or clips into permanent protection already {{attached to the}} rock. In traditional climbing, the protection generally is removable. However, many significant first ascents in the U.S. done {{with a combination of}} crack <b>gear</b> and <b>bolts</b> placed on lead were termed [...] "traditional" [...] at the time (see below discussion). Usually nuts or spring-loaded camming devices (often referred to as [...] "cams" [...] or [...] "friends") are set in cracks in the rock (although pitons are sometimes used). In sport climbing the protection is metal loops called hangers. Hangers are secured to the rock with either expanding masonry bolts taken from the construction industry, or by placing glue-in bolt systems. In ice climbing the protection is made-up of ice screws or similar devices hammered or screwed into the ice by the leader, and removed by the second climber.|$|R
40|$|The {{internal}} gear box (IGB) of an aeroengine represents a severe challenge in {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD). In the present study, an axisymmetric CFD model was assessed to investigate the complex internal air flow in an aeroengine IGB. All the non-axisymmetric components and geometry features inside the gear box, such as bearings, <b>gears,</b> <b>bolts</b> and slots, {{as well as the}} radial drive system and vent pipes, were simulated using porous media models. Their flow resistance was estimated either by empirical correlations or by preparatory CFD studies and comparison with measurements. To evaluate the CFD technique adopted in the present investigation, a separate bolt windage study was conducted using a similar axisymmtric CFD model with the porous media approach. Good agreement of the bolt windage with other workers' rig test data was observed. The present application of the porous media approach into a complex gear box flow represents a first attempt to use state of art CFD to assist an industrial design. Both maximum take-off (MTO) and ground idle (GI) running conditions were investigated. The complex flow patterns in the gear box were obtained. The results show a similar dimensionless performance of intermediate pressure (IP) and high pressure (HP) gears between the two operating conditions. For the present gear box arrangement under investigation, the CFD results suggest that the airflows induced by the HP gear and HP bearing are higher than their IP counterparts. A comparison with power absorption rig test data for the similar HP crownwheel in isolation shows that an assumption of pressure loss coefficient of 10 for the porous media of bevel gears may be appropriate, as the HP gear torque coefficient obtained in the CFD prediction is equal to 0. 05, very close to its expected value. In addition, the effects of an assumed stationary IP gear and a large seal clearance on the HP gear performance were also investigated. The numerical results show that their impacts are insignificant, probably due to the strong pumping effects of the HP gear. Further discussion on the possible influence of the airflow on the oil motion within the gearbox and assistance to improve the traditional internal airflow models used for bearing chamber sealing analysis was also made. Three dimensional geometry modeling and inclusion of the oil phase are considered feasible. Such further investigations would aid the understanding of the interaction between the induced airflow due to the rotating components and oil motion, and their impact on oil scavenging behaviour and `windage' contribution to heat oil...|$|R

50|$|During {{the design}} and {{development}} of new products, designers and engineers rely on both a bottom-up and top-down approach. The bottom-up approach is being utilized when off-the-shelf or existing components are selected and integrated into the product. An example would include selecting a particular fastener, such as a bolt, and designing the receiving components such that the fastener will fit properly. In a top-down approach, a custom fastener would be designed such that it would fit properly in the receiving components.For perspective, for a product with more restrictive requirements (such as weight, geometry, safety, environment, etc.), such as a space-suit, a more top-down approach is taken and almost everything is custom designed. However, when it's more important to minimize cost and increase component availability, such as with manufacturing equipment, a more bottom-up approach would be taken, and as many off-the-shelf components (<b>bolts,</b> <b>gears,</b> bearings, etc.) would be selected as possible. In the latter case, the receiving housings would be designed around the selected components.|$|R

40|$|Physical {{models of}} {{machines}} have {{played an important}} role in the history of engineering for teaching, analyzing, and exploring mechanical concepts. Many of these models have been replaced today by computational representations, but new rapid-prototyping technology allows reintroduction of physical models as an intuitive way to demonstrate mechanical concepts. This paper reports on the use of computer-aided modeling tools and rapid prototyping technology to document, preserve, and reproduce in three dimensions, historic machines and mechanisms. We have reproduced several pre-assembled, fully-functional historic mechanisms such as early straight line mechanisms, ratchets, pumps, and clock escapements, including various kinematic components such as links, joints, <b>gears,</b> worms, nuts, <b>bolts,</b> and springs. The historic mechanisms come from the Cornell Collection of Reuleaux Kinematic Models as well as models based on the work of Leonardo da Vinci. The models are available as part of a new online museum of mechanism, which allows visitors not only to read descriptions and view pictures and videos, but now also download, 3 D-print and interact with their own physical replicas. Our aim in this paper is to demonstrate the ability of this technology to reproduce accurate historical kinematic models and machines as a tool for both artifact conservancy as well as for teaching, and to demonstrate this for a wide range of mechanism types. We expect that this new form of ?physical? preservation will become prevalent in future archives. We describe the background and history of the collection as well as aspects of modeling and printing such functional replicas...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a thesis}} {{presents}} a differential gear which {{is found in}} a tracked vehicle called BvS 10. The tracked vehicle is manufactured by BAE Systems Hägglunds AB in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden. The differential <b>gear</b> has a <b>bolted</b> house. The differential meets the requirement specifications, {{but the problem is}} that the bolts are sheared off because of the extreme torque that the differential is exposed to resist. Previous report on the differential show pictures of bolts which have been sheared off at the threads. This report is also includes three lists that explain seven different proposals which some are approved and some are not, and the report also presents the force, tensile, and shear stress. In a bolted connection there is both axial tension stress and radial shear stress, which can lead to wear out and broken bolts. To solve the problem, better bolts are need for the differential gear housing halves. The bolts are from M 8 to M 10 and all bolts are not directly compatible, so geometric modifications might have to be done. This reports proposes several solutions to this complex problem and also analyzes the proposed solutions. The report also describes various theories from a technical and a historical point of view. Two flow charts have been created to show the work towards the presented solution. Although the analysis to welded joints and wedge joints have been included in the proposed solution. The report propose a tight-fit bolt with a tolerance specially made for the differential gear, so the shear stress occurs at the non-threaded part of the bolt. The tight-fitted bolt is recommended to be M 8 12. 9 UNB because of it’s safety factor. Larger bolts may not directly fit in the differential housing halves due to there is no enough material...|$|R
