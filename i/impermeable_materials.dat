Aluminum and vinyl are <b>impermeable</b> <b>materials</b> so the natural transfer of moisture through the wood trim will be trapped {{when it reaches}} the capping material. The quality of paint on some aluminum coil stock begins to chalk or fade in about five years so the claim of being maintenance free can be misleading.|$|E
50|$|It {{is used as}} a sealant in roads or on {{the shells}} of fresh eggs: when sodium {{silicate}} is applied as a sealant to cured concrete or egg shells, it chemically reacts with calcium hydroxide or calcium carbonate to form calcium silicate hydrate, sealing micropores with a relatively <b>impermeable</b> <b>material.</b>|$|R
50|$|Similar problems, {{although}} on a {{very much}} larger scale, confront the builders of modern commercial properties which often have flat roofs.

50|$|Until the 20th century masonry {{buildings}} in Europe and North America were generally constructed from highly permeable {{materials such as}} stone and lime-based mortars and renders covered with soft water-based paints which all allowed any damp to diffuse into the air without damage. The later application of <b>impermeable</b> <b>materials</b> which prevent the natural dispersion of damp, such as tiles, linoleum, cement and gypsum-based materials and synthetic paints is thought {{by some to be}} the most significant cause of damp problems in older buildings.|$|E

The decorative floor tiles in octagonal shaped have floral patterns {{in the form of a}} geometric eight-petalled flowers. The tiles are similar to the tiles of European origins found in an advertisement in 1912 catalogue.|$|E

50|$|Most bicycle tires, many {{motorcycle}} tires, {{and many}} tires for large vehicles such as buses, heavy trucks, and tractors {{are designed for}} use with inner tubes. Inner tubes are torus-shaped balloons made from an <b>impermeable</b> <b>material,</b> such as soft, elastic synthetic rubber, to prevent air leakage.

50|$|The {{river is}} a 'perch' stream, flowing over {{a bed of}} <b>impermeable</b> <b>material</b> {{on top of a}} porous substrate. This state is only quasi-stable, since in periods of low {{rainfall}} the water table drops below the level of the impermeable layer. If ground works are then carried out which damage this layer, the river can sink into the porous substrate and disappear.|$|R
50|$|Screen {{printing}} uses a {{mesh screen}} that is coated with an <b>impermeable</b> paint-like <b>material</b> {{to make a}} stencil of the design. The ink can pass through the bare mesh, but is stopped by the <b>impermeable</b> stencil <b>material.</b> These screens are made by the printer before use, either by painting the stencil material only where it is needed or more commonly, as with the Gocco, by a simple photographic process.|$|R
50|$|The {{risks of}} {{leachate}} generation can be mitigated by properly designed and engineered landfill sites, {{such as those}} that are constructed on geologically <b>impermeable</b> <b>materials</b> or sites that use impermeable liners made of geomembranes or engineered clay. The use of linings is now mandatory within the United States, Australia and the European Union except where the waste is deemed inert. In addition, most toxic and difficult materials are now specifically excluded from landfilling. However, despite much stricter statutory controls, leachates from modern sites are often found to contain a range of contaminants stemming from illegal activity or legally discarded household and domestic products.|$|E

To give one example, Duvigneaud, in his study of the “Écosystème Urbs” (Duvigneaud and Denaeyer-De Smet 1977) in Brussels, shows how the large quantity of rainwater runoff pouring into sewers is due to “the predominance of stone or other hard and <b>impermeable</b> <b>materials,</b> as against soft and water-permeable soil”. 1 [...]...|$|E
30|$|Drainage density (Dd) is {{described}} {{as an expression of}} the closeness of spacing of channels and quantitatively obtained by the ratio of total channel segment lengths within a basin over the basin area (Horton 1945; Strahler 1964). The Dd of the Jamini watersheds is 1.43 (Table  2). Low drainage density (1.28) of the Jamrar subwatershed is favored of resistant lithology or highly permeable subsoil materials, under dense vegetations while high drainage density (1.49) of the Onri and Sainam subwatershed is favored in regions of weak or <b>impermeable</b> <b>materials</b> with sparse vegetation cover (Strahler 1964).|$|E

In addition, the DPC may be sealed to the DPM around the outside edges of the ground floor, completely sealing the inside of the building from the damp ground around it.|$|R
50|$|Markers {{are placed}} on flanged posts at {{approximate}} one-tenth mile intervals with a tolerance of ±0.01 mile. On two-lane roads, they are usually placed in alternate directions of travel. On four-lane roads, they are placed in both directions. If an intersection, <b>impermeable</b> <b>material,</b> or other obstruction exists, a marker may be placed nearby but {{in violation of the}} above tolerance, {{on the opposite side of}} the road on which it would otherwise be placed, or missing altogether. A missing marker is yet accounted for in the overall sequence.|$|R

This dam type {{is a good choice}} for sites with wide valleys. They can be built on hard rock or softer soils. For a rock-fill dam, rock-fill is blasted using explosives to break the rock. Additionally, the rock pieces may need to be crushed into smaller grades to get the right range of size for use in an embankment dam.|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of sodium lactate on nitrite during meat curing. In a model system, 8 reaction components were used to assess the effect of each on metmyoglobin reducing activity by excluding one component at a time. Excluding lactate, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or phenazine methosulfate (PMS) resulted in no reducing activity. A second experiment utilizing a meat mixture, lactate was added to ground beef at concentrations ranging from 2 % to 6 %, with or without nitrite, packaged in oxygen-permeable and <b>impermeable</b> <b>materials,</b> and stored for up to 96 hours. There was less residual nitrite when sodium lactate was added to the mixture. Results from both experiments supported the hypothesis that lactate generated NADH which reduced metmyoglobin to deoxymyoglobin, with the resulting greater concentration of reduced myoglobin reacting with nitrite to produce more nitric oxide, reducing nitrite concentration and accelerating the curing reaction...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of a fluid pressure load on the extensile fracturing of mortar and sandstone has been investigated. A fluid pressure in the (initiating) fracture stimulates both fracture initiation and propagation and may {{be as effective as}} a directly applied uniaxial tensile stress. The efficiency of the fracture pressure depends on the degree of saturation For the saturated materials, a pore pressure is generated under loading which counteracts the applied stress. The effective stresses governing the mechanical behaviour of the saturated materials then are lower, giving rise to an apparent stiffer behaviour, a lower effective fracture pressure and higher fracture initiation and propagation stresses. The magnitude of the pore pressure depends, among others, on the permeability of the materials. For <b>impermeable</b> <b>materials,</b> the pore pressure increases linearly with the hydrostatic stress, for permeable materials it is equal to the applied fluid pressure. With the increase in pore pressure, the effective stresses reduce and may even become zero when cohesion of the material is low...|$|E
40|$|Most of {{the roads}} are paved with <b>impermeable</b> <b>materials</b> such as asphalt {{concrete}} and cement concrete, and {{in the event of}} heavy rainfall, rainwater directly flows into river through a drainage hole on the pavement surface. This large quantity of rainwater directly spilled into the river frequently leads to the flooding of urban streams, damaging lowlands and the lower reaches of a river. In recent years there has {{been a great deal of}} ongoing research concerning water permeability and drainage in pavements. Accordingly, in this research, a porous polymer concrete was developed for permeable pavement by using unsaturated polyester resin as a binder, recycled aggregate as coarse aggregate, fly ash and blast furnace slag as filler, and its physical and mechanical properties were investigated. Also, 3 types of permeable polymer block by optimum mix design were developed and rainfall runoff reduction effects by permeability pavement using permeable polymer block were analyzed based on hydraulic experimental model. The infiltration volume, infiltration ratio, runoff initial time and runoff volume in permeability pavement with permeable polymer block o...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} a hygro-mechanical {{approach}} to modelling corrosion induced cracking is pro-posed. A coupled transport and mechanical lattice model based on Delaunay and Voronoi tessellations {{is used to}} model the penetration of corrosion products into a concrete specimen. The penetration of the corrosion products into the concrete is described by constitutive laws developed for mass transport through porous materials. The cracking caused by the penetration of corrosion products is modelled by the mechanical lattice using a damage mechanics constitutive law. The coupled approach is ver-ified by comparison of the numerical results with the analytical solution of an elastic thick-walled permeable cylinder, which has been derived in the present work. Then, the coupled model {{is applied to the}} analysis of corrosion induced cracking. The results of the new approach are compared to those of a purely mechanical approach for an <b>impermeable</b> <b>material.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|It was {{determined}} that spent hydrocarbons buried at the landfill disposal site included not only chlorobenzene, hexachlorobutadiene, hexachloroethane, hexachloronorbornadiene, naphthalene, tetrachloroethylene, toluene, hexachlorocyclopentadiene, and benzene, but also the known carcinogens carbon tetrachloride and chloroform. The drums and cartons containing these chemicals were deposited in trenches that were 15 ft deep and 12 to 15 ft wide and covered with approximately 3 ft of soil. Velsicol took no precautions to insure the drums from bursting and, invariably, some of the drums would leak their contents into the soil. Furthermore, the trenches were neither lined nor covered with any <b>impermeable</b> <b>material</b> to prevent the chemical waste from leaking into the soil. Velsicol eventually placed a clay cap over the landfill site in 1980 only after state authorities threatened a lawsuit over the imminent danger the landfill posed to the environment.|$|R
40|$|Chlorinated solvent {{contamination}} {{is widespread}} across the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) complex and other industrial facilities. Because {{of the physical}} properties of dense nonaqueous-phase liquids (DNAPLs), current treatment technologies are generally incapable of completely removing contamination from the source area. Incomplete removal means that the residual DNAPL will persist as a long-term source of groundwater contamination. When DNALPs occur in the subsurface, they resist remediation, owing to low water volubility, high viscosity and interracial tension, and microbial recalcitrance. Because of their high density and polarity, they are usually found sorbed to aquifer solids or in pools on <b>impermeable</b> <b>materials.</b> Surfactants have been used with some success to reduce interracial tension between the aqueous and organic phases and improve volubility of DNAPLs. However, surfactants are expensive and toxic and exhibit an oxygen demand. An alternative {{is the use of}} dissolved humic acids in improving DNAPL mobilization and solubilization. Humic acids, a. natural form of organic carbon, are abundant, inexpensive, and nontoxic; biodegrade slowly (low oxygen demand); and have excellent mobilization properties.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} paper is the mapping of land cover area of metropolitan railway right of way. The study focuses {{on the outskirts of the}} Line F metropolitan train in Sao Paulo. The methodology includes the use of the high spatial resolution satellite image - IKONOS II, object-based classification and application of the CORINE Land Cover Programme. The regions-based classifiers use, besides spectral information of each pixel, the spatial information that involves the relationship between the pixels and its neighbours. Through visual interpretation, were identified twelve classes of land covers, which features guided the segmentation parameters. The segmented image was classified using Bhattacharyya distance and post-classified using rules and criteria established for each class, according to their attributes and contextualization. The performance of the final classification was evaluated based on Kappa coefficient, resulting acceptable level of correspondence. The mapping of land cover generated from the classification, shows that the outskirts of the metropolitan railway`s right way is predominantly composed by <b>impermeable</b> <b>materials</b> - such as asphalt and concrete - but has significant presence of natural elements - such as vegetation and water.

40|$|In Okitipupa area, south western Nigeria, the {{aquifers}} of the Coastal Plain sands {{are largely}} Quaternary porous sediments, but without records of their subsurface disposition. In this study, fifty Schlumberger soundings were conducted over the study area, aimed at delineating the boundaries, depth {{range of the}} shallow aquifer units, and assessing their vulnerability to near-surface contaminants. The study delineated two major aquifer units within the area: (i) the upper/surficial aquifer system, which occur at depths ranging from 5. 8 m (around Agbabu) to 61. 5 m (around Ikoya), and with materials of higher average resistivity (504. 7 Ωm), suggestive of gravelly/coarse to medium-grained sand and (ii) the intermediate aquifer system, characterised by depth range of 32. 1 - 127. 5 m, average resistivity of 296. 8 Ωm, typical of medium-grained sand saturated with water. The highly resistive, <b>impermeable</b> <b>materials</b> overlying the aquifer units around Ajagba, Aiyesan, Agbetu, Ilutitun, Igbotako, and Erinj suggests that the aquifer units are less vulnerable to near-surface contaminants than in Agbabu, Igbisin, Ugbo, and Aboto where aquifers are overlain by less resistive materials. This study enabled the delineation of shallow aquifers, their subsurface disposition, and identified promising areas for elaborate groundwater development in the area. An integration of such geophysical study with lithologic logs/drilling data would enhance accurate delineation of aquifers and vulnerability quantification in the area.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Studies {{have shown}} that {{convective}} air flow can significantly reduce the thermal resistance of frame walls insulated with mineral fibre insulation (MFI).

In this work, we consider some aspects of the internal fluid-thermal dynamics of caves, especially buoyancy and natural convection due to geothermal heating, characterized by a Rayleigh number defined for cave conditions. Two-dimensional steady state computer models of idealized caves were created using FEMLAB multiphysics computer software. The thermal properties of limestone and air, and geothermal flux were incorporated into the models. Limestone was considered an <b>impermeable</b> <b>material.</b> The models couple the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (air phase only) with the thermal energy convection and conduction equation using the finite element method.
