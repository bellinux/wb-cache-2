25|$|Pignut hickory {{frequently}} {{grows on}} dry ridgetops and sideslopes throughout its range {{but it is}} also common on moist sites, particularly in the mountains and Piedmont. In the Great Smoky Mountains pignut hickory has been observed on dry sandy soils at low elevations. Whittaker (27) placed pignut in a submesic class and charted it as ranging up to 1480 m (4,850ft)-the hickory with the greatest <b>elevational</b> range in the Great Smoky Mountains. In southwest Virginia, south-facing upper slopes from 975 to 1050 m (3,200 to 3,445ft) of Beanfield Mountain are dominated by pignut hickory, northern red oak Quercus rubra), and white oak (Q. alba). This site is the most xeric habitat on the mountain because of high insolation, 70 percent slopes, and medium- to coarse-textured soils derived from Clinch sandstone. Mid-elevation slopes from 800 to 975 m (2,625 to 3,200ft) are dominated by chestnut oak (Q. prinus), northern red oak, and pignut hickory and coincide with three shale formations (12).|$|E
25|$|Research and {{measurement}} by Koch and Richard André Barraud in 2006 suggested {{a more complex}} method of ordering that relates better to the 17th century records. Whereas Begley and Desai had used a simple fixed grid on which the buildings are superimposed, Koch and Barraud found the layout's proportions were better explained {{by the use of}} a generated grid system in which specific lengths may be divided {{in a number of ways}} such as halving, dividing by three or using decimal systems. They suggest the 374-gaz width of the complex given by the contemporary historians was correct and the Taj is planned as a tripartite rectangle of three 374-gaz squares. Different modular divisions are then used to proportion the rest of the complex. A 17-gaz module is used in the jilaukhana, bazaar and caravanserais areas whereas a more detailed 23-gaz module is used in the garden and terrace areas (since their width is 368 gaz, a multiple of 23). The buildings were in turn proportioned using yet smaller grids superimposed on the larger organisational ones. The smaller grids were also used to establish <b>elevational</b> proportion throughout the complex.|$|E
25|$|George Doundoulakis, who {{directed}} research at General Bronze Corporation in Garden City, New York, along with Zachary Sears, {{who directed}} Internal Design at Digital B & E Corporation, New York, received the RFP from Cornell University for the antenna design {{and studied the}} idea of suspending the feed with his brother, Helias Doundoulakis, a civil engineer. George Doundoulakis identified the problem that a tower or tripod would have presented around the center, (the most important area of the reflector), and devised a better design by suspending the feed. He presented his proposal to Cornell for a doughnut truss suspended by four cables from four towers above the reflector, having along its edge a rail track for the azimuth truss positioning. This second truss, {{in the form of}} an arc, or arch, was to be suspended below, which would rotate on the rails through 360 degrees. The arc also had rails on which the unit supporting the feed would move for the feed's <b>elevational</b> positioning. A counterweight would move symmetrically opposite to the feed for stability and, if a hurricane struck, the whole feed could be raised and lowered. Helias Doundoulakis designed the cable suspension system which was finally adopted. Although the present configuration is substantially the same as the original drawings by George and Helias, (though with three towers instead of the original four), the U.S. Patent office granted Helias a patent, for the brothers' innovative idea. Another assignee on the patent, William J. Casey, later became director of the Central Intelligence Agency under President Ronald Reagan.|$|E

2500|$|The Gran Sabana (literally [...] "Great Savannah") {{is a vast}} area of {{tropical}} uplands covering nearly 30,000km2, which surrounds many of the tepuis of the eastern range. It gradually rises in elevation from 750m {{in the south to}} 1450m in the north. The rocky uplands of Sierra de Lema and Sierra Senkopirén lie to the north and northwest of the Gran Sabana and surround the Auyán Massif. They have an <b>elevational</b> range of around 700 to 1650m. Cerro Venamo is a sandstone mountain near the border between Venezuela and Guyana, at the northeastern tip of the Gran Sabana. With a height of 1600m it falls somewhere between an upland and a true highland area. As with many other localities in the Guayana Highlands, the name Cerro Venamo has been inconsistently applied to a number of adjacent areas.|$|E
2500|$|The Canyons and Dissected Highlands {{ecoregion}} {{is characterized}} by steeply sloping, upper river canyons and dissected plateaus in the rain shadow of the mountains. It includes the southern Seven Devils Mountains and pieces of the uplifted Columbia Plateau, where the basalt has been eroded {{to a series of}} knife-edge ridges flanked by deep canyons. The region occupies the <b>elevational</b> zone above the unforested Canyons and Dissected Uplands, at an elevation of 4,000to6,400feet (1,219to1,951m). The steep terrain limits human activities. The region is drier than the marine-influenced Mesic Forest Zone that exists at similar elevations to the west. Moisture retaining loess and ash soils support Douglas-fir, larch, and grand fir on relatively level benches and Douglas-fir in unstable colluvial soils on steep canyon slopes. Western ponderosa pine forest is also present, with ninebark, snowberry, oceanspray, heartleaf arnica, elk sedge, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, and bluegrass. Riparian areas support mountain alder, stinking and prickly currant, thimbleberry, and Columbia monk’s hood. The region covers [...] in Oregon, [...] in Idaho, and smaller areas in Washington, including parts of the Wallowa-Whitman, Nez Perce, and Payette National Forests, the Wenaha–Tucannon Wilderness, and the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area.|$|E
2500|$|The Partly Forested Mountains {{ecoregion}} {{occupies the}} <b>elevational</b> belt above the Semiarid Uplands on the Jarbidge, Independence, Owyhee, and Steens mountains, from 6,500to10,900feet (1,981to3,322m). These are partially glaciated, high, rugged mountains with glacial features including moraines, cirques, and tarn (lake)s. Perennial or intermittent, high gradient, cold streams are fed by snowmelt and springs, supporting federally threatened bull trout and Lahontan cutthroat trout in Nevada. Riffle segments have cobble or boulder substrates. Annual precipitation {{is sufficient to}} support a Great Basin pine forest community of Douglas-fir, subalpine fir, ponderosa pine, and limber pine, with whitebark pine near the tree line, and aspen stands in riparian meadows, moist draws, and wet depressions. The understory features low juniper, mountain big sagebrush, mountain brush, serviceberry, snowberry, mountain-mahogany, Idaho fescue, sheep fescue, rough fescue, bottlebrush squirreltail, prairie lupine, mountain brome, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Sandberg bluegrass. Small areas of tundra and alpine meadows are found at the highest elevations. On Steens Mountain, above the juniper woodland zone of the Semirarid Uplands, the landscape is almost treeless; broad areas of mountain big sagebrush alternate with scattered groves of aspen. Alpine areas on Steens Mountain were seriously eroded following intense grazing by domestic sheep in the late 19th century. The region covers [...] in Nevada, [...] in Oregon, and [...] in Idaho, and contains the Jarbidge Wilderness in the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest.|$|E
5000|$|For certain taxa and regions, {{there is}} a mid <b>elevational</b> peak in species richness. This pattern has {{received}} empirical support for small mammals, spiders, ants [...] and plants. Alternatively, microbes {{have been shown to}} exhibit not only monotonically decreasing diversity when moving from low to high elevations, but also increasing, hump-shaped, and U-shaped <b>elevational</b> patterns in diversity.One explanation for a mid <b>elevational</b> peak includes mid <b>elevational</b> condensation zones. Under the assumption that natural boundaries can limit species distributions in varying degrees (for example, a mountain can present absolute <b>elevational</b> limits), Collwell and Lees explained the mid domain effect with geometric theory. In the context of a mountain, geometric boundary constraints will naturally result in the increasing overlap of species ranges nearing the midpoint of the mountain. Using vascular epiphytes in Costa Rica, Cardelus et al. (2008) noted that the <b>elevational</b> species richness pattern observed was substantially due to the mid domain effect; there was a bulge in epiphyte species richness at 1000m (The cloud forest).|$|E
50|$|A {{pattern in}} species {{richness}} is also observed as one moves along an <b>elevational</b> gradient; generally, species richness {{is thought to}} decline with increasing elevation. Whether this decline is monotonic or if it assumes different shapes based on the taxa or region being studied is still a topic of debate. In a review of previous studies looking at <b>elevational</b> diversity gradients, Rahbek noted the importance of other factors contributing {{to the shape of}} a gradient, distinguishing <b>elevational</b> patterns from those described by the latitudinal diversity gradient.|$|E
