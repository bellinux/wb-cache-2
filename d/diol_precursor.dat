Remarkably, following this 3-6 hour, 25oC process, a 45-55% yield of bicyclic diol 17 could be isolated. Hence, it was not necessary to do anything specific to promote the required sequence of 8π conrotatory and 6π disrotatory cyclizations (further highlighted in supplementary image); they occurred spontaneously on generation of tetraene-diol 15. Protection of a single alcohol moiety (as TBDPS) was accomplished using the silyl chloride via the corresponding tricyclic iodoether intermediate (not shown), with the internally masked remaining hydroxyl group being released on treatment with zinc dust in acetic acid (giving 18 in 70-80% yield). Bromination of the alcohol under Appel conditions followed by its displacement on treatment with sodium cyanide in HMPA gave nitrile 20, the key intermediate in all of this groups endiandric acid syntheses.|$|E

Starting from the commercially available methyl ß-hydroxy isobutyrate three key inter-mediates are generated in 25 steps overall. Evans aldol addition and Evans alkylation serve as key steps to introduce new stereogenic centers with defined configuration. The synthesis of the tetrahydropyrane sub-unit results from a direct regio and diastereoselective cyclization of a 1, 5 <b>diol</b> <b>precursor.</b> The coupling of two fragments succeeded via Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons olefination. Twelve of fifteen stereogenic centers of the target Zincophorine are efficiently built-up with high diastereoselectivities. The second part of this thesis describes a novel synthesis of an enantiopure Cyoctol. Starting from the bicyclic core fragment of a carbacycline precursor a range of alkylation methods are investigated to introduce the side chain.

40|$|A {{new family}} of surf ace-modified {{carbohydrates}} with locked, axial-rich conformations and bipolarofacial architectures {{has been developed}} {{with the aid of}} carbocyclic ring annulation. These novel trans-decalin-based carbohydrates have been synthesized, from simple aromatic precursors such as tetralin, through the ozonolysis of an appropriately protected allylic alcohol, followed by a cascade of intramolecular acetalizations to generate the sugar pyran moiety. The stereoselective synthesis of (racemic) cyclohexane-annulated 0 -glucopyranoside and a-glucofuranoside from a common annulated trans-cyclohexadiene <b>diol</b> (trans-CHD) <b>precursor</b> under-scores the versatility of our approach. The efficacy of the annulation stratagem in generating carbohydrate diversity has been demonstrated through the synthesis of two regioisomeric annulated gulose derivatives, which differ only in the site of ring annulation on the sugar moiety. The mapping of the MLP surface and solid-state architecture of the new sugar shows that cycloalkane annulation results in surface modification and fine-tuning of sugar hydrophilicity.

The first approach involved quantitative ethylene end-capping of telechelic diiodo poly(VDF-co-PMVE) copolymer and subsequent hydrolysis to form diols with ethylene spacers (C 2) between -OH moieties and the fluorinated oligomeric chain. The second pathway to obtain fluorinated diols involved the radical addition of telechelic poly(VDF-co-PMVE) copolymer onto allyl alcohol to obtain bis(iodohydrine), the iodine atoms of which were further reduced to yield fluorinated diols (85 % yield) that bear three methylene groups (C 3) as the spacer.

40|$|Although the {{majority}} of scientists recognize the ecological impact of anthropogenic carbon dioxide, emissions are still increasing, mainly due to deforestation and burning of fossil fuels. In order to effectively reverse this process several parallel approaches are required. One interesting strategy consists in making carbon dioxide into a valuable resource {{for the production of}} fuels and chemicals, in an effort to close the carbon cycle. Carbon dioxide has a high thermodynamic stability, making it difficult to process in conventional thermocatalytic systems. However, an energy-efficient one-electron reduction allows to activate this highly stable molecule under mild and safe conditions. This work shows how carbon dioxide can be used as carbon source for the production of valuable carboxylic acids, through incorporation in organic substrates. The continuous and rapid improvement in electricity production from renewable resources (wind, water, sun, …) makes organic electrosynthesis into a very interesting and green alternative for traditional chemical processes. This synthetic strategy offers valorization routes {{for a wide range of}} renewable reactants. A first part focuses on the electrocarboxylation of conjugated dienes in the production of valuable dicarboxylic acids, which are potential polymer building blocks. The use of sacrificial anodes and careful optimization of reaction conditions allow to dicarboxylate internal conjugated dienes with good to excellent yields. Efficient CO 2 fixation in conjugated linoleic acid is established for the first time, opening routes to other renewable dienes. The effect of molecular configuration and alkyl substitution on electrocarboxylation efficiency was studied. In a second part, an innovative, more sustainable, pathway was devised and elaborated for a related reaction, using an inert anode. A paired electrosynthesis of diacid and <b>diol</b> <b>precursors</b> from dienes and CO 2 allows to increase the current and atom efficiency of the process. With tetraethylammonium trifluoroacetate both as electrolyte and reactant, 1, 3 -cyclohexadiene was converted to a dicarboxylate and diacetate product in a one-compartment setup. However, the reactivity of conjugated double bonds towards carboxylation and acetoxylation is highly dependent on alkyl substitution, complicating extension to other conjugated dienes. As a follow-up, a new paired electrosynthesis method was designed, allowing to convert carbon dioxide and alcohols into useful α-hydroxy acids, using inert electrodes. Anodic oxidation of alcohols to carbonyls and simultaneous cathodic carboxylation of these carbonyls with CO 2 produces one sole product. Preliminary tests transformed 1 -phenylethanol and benzhydrol to useful pharmaceutical intermediates in a one-compartment cell. A bromide-assisted decarboxylation of amino acids further demonstrates the potential of organic electrosynthesis in the valorization of renewable substrates. A wide range of naturally occurring amino acids can be converted efficiently to valuable nitriles in a single step, using bromide salts both as redox mediators and supporting electrolyte. Furthermore, the selectivity of the decarboxylation process can be tuned towards nitriles, amines or amides. In a last part, the electrochemical decarboxylation of amino acids with electrogenerated hypobromite was subjected to an electroanalytical study. By means of cyclic voltammetry, spectrophotometry and rotating ring disk electrode measurements, the effect of solvent, electrolyte and electrode material is confirmed and investigated. The water fraction and intrinsic acidity have a large effect on the hypobromite concentration. An efficient process is realized by finding a good balance between this concentration and the amino acid solubility. status: publishe...|$|R

For example BjF is active as a tumor initiator on mouse skin and is carcinogenic in both mouse skin and in rat lungs. Recently, BjF was also found to induce tumors in newborn mouse lung and liver. The mechanism of actions of BjF is similar to other PAHs. The diolepoxide mechanism involves formation of stable and unstable DNA adducts, mainly at G and A, which can lead to mutations in proto-oncogenes (RAS) and tumour-suppressor genes (P53). Many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon diolepoxides and their <b>precursor</b> <b>diols</b> and epoxides are tumorigenic in animals. The radical cation mechanism involves generation of unstable adducts at G and A, leading to apurinic sites and mutations in HRAS.

40|$|The work {{leading to}} this thesis has {{provided}} additional information and novel knowledge concerning structure-function {{relationship in the}} potato epoxide hydrolase. Epoxide hydrolases are enzymes catalyzing the hydrolysis of epoxides to yield the corresponding vicinal diols. The reaction mechanism proceeds via a nucleophilic attack resulting in a covalent alkylenzyme intermediate, {{which in turn is}} attacked by a base-activated water molecule, followed by product release. Epoxides and <b>diols</b> are <b>precursors</b> in the production of chiral compounds and the use of epoxide hydrolases as biocatalysts is growing. The promising biocatalyst StEH 1, a plant epoxide hydrolase from potato, has been investigated in this thesis. In paper I the active site residue Glu 35, was established to be important for the formation of the alkylenzyme intermediate, activating the nucleophile for attack by facilitated proton release through a hydrogen bond network. Glu 35 is also important during the hydrolytic half reaction by optimally orienting the hydrolytic water molecule, aiding in the important dual function of the histidine base. Glu 35 makes it possible for the histidine to work as both an acid and a base. In paper II a putative proton wire composed of five water molecules lining a protein tunnel was proposed to facilitate effective proton transfer from the exterior to the active site, aiding in protonation of the alkylenzyme intermediate. The protein tunnel is also proposed to stabilize plant epoxide hydrolases via hydrogen bonds between water molecules and protein. Enzyme variants with modified enantiospecificity for the substrate (2, 3 -epoxypropyl) benzene have been constructed by in vitro evolution using the CASTing approach. Residues lining the active site pocket were targeted for mutagenesis. From the second generation libraries a quadruple enzyme variant, W 106 L/L 109 Y/V 141 K/I 155 V, displayed a radical shift in enantioselectivity.
