40|$|We {{present an}} {{evidence}} of isospin effects in nuclear fission {{by comparing the}} <b>fission</b> <b>widths</b> for reactions involving different isospin states of the same compound nucleus (CN). Yadrovsky suggested this possibility in 1975.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} analysis of the impact of resonance parameter uncertainties on covariances for neutron capture and fission cross sections in the resolved resonance region. Our analysis uses the uncertainties available in the recently published Atlas of Neutron Resonances employing the Multi-Level Breit-Wigner formalism. We consider uncertainties on resonance energies along with those on neutron-, radiative-, and fission-widths and examine their impact on cross section uncertainties and correlations. We also study the effect of the resonance parameter correlations deduced from capture and fission kernels and illustrate our approach on several practical examples. We show that uncertainties of neutron-, radiative- and fission-widths are important, while the uncertainties of resonance energies can be effectively neglected. We conclude that the correlations between neutron and radiative (<b>fission)</b> <b>widths</b> should be taken into account.

40|$|Transients in the fission {{of highly}} excited nuclei are {{studied in the}} {{framework}} of the Langevin equation. Time-dependent <b>fission</b> <b>widths</b> are calculated which show that after the initial transients, a steady flow towards the scission point is established not only for nuclei which have fission barriers but also for nuclei which have no fission barrier. It is shown from a comparison of the transient time and the fission life time that fission changes from a diffusive to a transient dominated process over a certain transition region {{as a function of the}} spin of the fissioning nucleus. Multiplicities of prescission neutrons are calculated in a statistical model with as well as without a single swoop description of fission and they are found to differ in the transition region. We however find that the difference is marginal and hence a single swoop picture of fission though not strictly valid in the transition region can still be used in the statistical model calculations.

Two incident energies (between 200 and 300 MeV) {{have been used}} for 238 U, 209 Bi, 165 Ho and natMo targets. For a natSb target, the fission excitation function has been measured from 160 to 300 MeV. The experimental method was an improved version of the angular correlation method, which takes into account kinetic energies and time-of-flight correlations. This allowed us to eliminate fission events following transfer reactions and also random events. Assuming that the angular distribution is that characteristic of fission fragments issued from a compound nucleus (close to 1 /sinθ) the fission cross sections range from 10 ± 1 mb for Ar + Mo at 200 MeV to 1030 ± 120 mb for Ar + U at 300 MeV. When necessary, these cross sections {{have been added to the}} cross sections for the formation of evaporation-residue nuclei measured by other authors in order to obtain complete-fusion cross sections. The deduced critical angular momentum for formation of a complete-fusion nucleus are found to be an increasing function of the mass and energy of the incoming particle. These results are used to test the concept of a critical distance of approach which would govern fusion between two complex nuclei. The threshold of the excitation function measured for Ar + Sb is compared with calculations based on the statistical model for the competition between fission and evaporation.

40|$|Abstract. Fission {{induced by}} {{peripheral}} heavy-ion collisions at relativistic energies {{is a powerful}} experimental approach to determine the dynamical delay of fission (transient time) due to dissipation. The fissioning nuclei produced by this method have small shape distortions, low angular momentum and high excitation energies at which this dynamical delay can be observed. These conditions allow for applying the model of Grangé and Weidenmüller to obtain a quantitative value of the transient time. Such approach was followed at GSI where the total and partial fission cross-sections and the widths of the charge distributions of the fission residues from {{a large number of}} nuclei were measured. The analysis of these data in the frame of an abrasion-evaporation code has lead to a transient time of 2. 1 ⋅ 10 - 21 s when using a step function to describe the time dependence of the <b>fission</b> <b>width.</b> This result implies that excitation energies larger than 100 MeV are needed to observe this transient time. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{experimental}} emission {{probabilities of}} complex fragments by low energy compound nuclei and their dependence upon energy and Z value are {{compared to the}} transition state rates. Intermediate-mass-fragment multiplicity distributions {{for a variety of}} reactions at intermediate energies are shown to be binomial and thus reducible at all measured transverse energies. From these distributions a single binary event probability can be extracted which has a thermal dependence. A strong thermal signature is also found in the charge distributions. The n-fold charge distributions are reducible to the 1 -fold charge distributions through a simple scaling dictated by fold number and charge conservation. 1. Transition State Rates and Complex Fragment Decay Widths The rates for fission decay, as well as for chemical reactions, are calculated most often by means of the transition state method [1]. In this approach, the reaction rate is equated to the flux of phase space density across a “suitably ” located hyperplane normal to the “reaction coordinate”. The “suitable ” location is typically chosen at a saddle point in collective coordinate space, which corresponds to a bottleneck in phase space. A smart choice of the transition state location should minimize the number of phase space trajectories doubling back across the hyperplane. The surprising success of the transition state method has prompted attempts to justify its validity in a more fundamental way, and to identify regimes in which deviations might be expected [2, 3, 4]. In what follows we shall compare experimental decay rates for complex fragment emission with transition state predictions, and search for energy E and atomic number Z dependent deviations that can be expected to exist.

40|$|As model parameters, {{necessary}} {{ingredients of}} theoretical models, {{are not always}} predicted by theory, a formal mathematical framework associated to the evaluation work is needed to obtain the best set of parameters (resonance parameters, optical models, <b>fission</b> barrier, average <b>width,</b> multigroup cross sections) with Bayesian statistical inference by comparing theory to experiment. The formal rule related to this methodology is to estimate the posterior density probability function {{of a set of}} parameters by solving an equation of the following type: pdf(posterior) ∼ pdf(prior) × a likelihood function. A fitting procedure can be seen as an estimation of the posterior density probability of a set of parameters (referred as x→) knowing a prior information on these parameters and a likelihood which gives the probability density function of observing a data set knowing x→. To solve this problem, two major paths could be taken: add approximations and hypothesis and obtain an equation to be solved numerically (minimum of a cost function or Generalized least Square method, referred as GLS) or use Monte-Carlo sampling of all prior distributions and estimate the final posterior distribution. Monte Carlo methods are natural solution for Bayesian inference problems. They avoid approximations (existing in traditional adjustment procedure based on chi-square minimization) and propose alternative in the choice of probability density distribution for priors and likelihoods. This paper will propose the use of what we are calling Bayesian Monte Carlo (referred as BMC {{in the rest of the}} manuscript) in the whole energy range from thermal, resonance and continuum range for all nuclear reaction models at these energies. Algorithms will be presented based on Monte-Carlo sampling and Markov chain. The objectives of BMC are to propose a reference calculation for validating the GLS calculations and approximations, to test probability density distributions effects and to provide the framework of finding global minimum if several local minimums exist.

40|$|The fission {{cross section}} of U 234 over the energy range of 180 keV to 6 MeV has been {{measured}} in high resolution experiment by neutron time of flight technique on the Synchrocyclotron at Harwell. The results show intermediate structure in the fission cross section near the vibrational resonance at 318 keV. The narrow intermediate structure below the threshold region (below 20 key) was first observed by James and Rae ref. (1. 11). The parameters {{of many of the}} fine structure levels comprising the resonances at 638 eV were determined by James and Slaughter, ref. (1. 12) who showed that the fission widths of the fine structure have a Lorentzian energy dependence. A broad resonance in the fission {{cross section of}} U 234 was first observed by Lamphere ref. (1. 2) in the subthreshold region at ~ 325 keV. The present measurements have confirmed the existence of the broad, resonance which is found to be centered at 318 keV. The fission cross section at 318 keV is obtained to be 0. l 6 b and is consistent with the value obtained by Lamphere ref. (1. 2). It has been suggested by Lynn ref. (1. 24) that the break observed at 318 keV is associated with a vibrational level occurring in the second minimum of the potential energy expressed as a function of nuclear deformation. It has also been suggested by Lynn that the narrow intermediate structure at low energy observed by James and Rae could be associated with the wing of a vibrational level which could be the one observed at 318 keV. The present measurements were carried out to discover whether intermediate structure exists in the fission cross section of U 234 at near subthreshold energy of 318 keV, and also to decide whether the properties of this structure were consistent with the parameters of the resonances at 638 eV, so verifying Lynn's suggestion. The structure is expected, from the low energy data, to have a spacing which is somewhat greater than the experimental energy resolution, ~ 1 keV at 318 keV. Significant fluctuations in the cross section have been observed and the evidence of the structure at this energy has been established. To support the evidence, the fission cross section has been simulated using a model based upon Lynn's theory of Intermediate Structure. From the simulation, the height of outer barrier of the double well potential curve has been estimated to be ~ 892 KeV. The simulated fission cross section yields a structure, the average properties of which are consistent with the average properties of the observed structure at 318 keV.
