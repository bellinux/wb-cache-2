This randomized questionnaire study aims to evaluate the onco-genetic counseling process and to compare {{the impact of the}} initial part of the oncogenetic counseling, when conducted via telephone versus in-person. The aspects of evaluations were: patients ’ expectations, satisfaction and experiences of genetic counseling, worry for developing hereditary cancer and health related quality of life. A total of 215 participants representing several cancer syndromes were randomized to counseling via telephone or in-person. The questionnaires were completed before and after oncogenetic nurse coun-seling, and 1 year after the entire counseling process. Overall, a high satisfaction rate with the oncogenetic coun-seling process was found among the participants regardless of whether the oncogenetic nurse counseling was conducted by telephone or in-person. The results show that a consid-erable number of participants experienced difficulties with the process of creating a pedigree and dissatisfaction with <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>surveillance</b> and prevention.

40|$|BACKGROUND : With a {{sustained}} national malaria incidence {{of fewer than}} one case per 1000 population at risk, in 2012 South Africa officially transitioned from controlling malaria to the ambitious goal of eliminating malaria within its borders by 2018. This review assesses the progress made in the 3 years since programme re-orientation while highlighting challenges and suggesting priorities for moving the malaria programme towards elimination. METHODS : National malaria case data and annual spray coverage data from 2010 until 2014 were assessed for trends. <b>Information</b> <b>on</b> <b>surveillance,</b> monitoring and evaluation systems, human and infrastructure needs and community malaria knowledge was sourced from the national programme mid-term review. RESULTS : Malaria cases increased markedly from 6811 in 2013 to 11, 711 in 2014, with Mpumalanga and Limpopo provinces most affected. Enhanced local transmission appeared to drive malaria transmission in Limpopo Province, while imported malaria cases accounted {{for the majority of}} cases reported in Mpumalanga Province. Despite these increases only Vhembe and Mopani districts in Limpopo Province reported malaria incidences more than one case per 1000 population at risk by 2014. Over the review period annual spray coverage did not reach the recommended target of 90 % coverage, with information gaps identified in parasite prevalence, artemether-lumefantrine therapeutic utilization, asymptomatic/sub-patent carriage, drug efficacy, vector distribution and insecticide resistance. CONCLUSIONS : Although South Africa has made steady progress since adopting an elimination agenda, a number of challenges have been identified. The heterogeneity of malaria transmission suggests interventions in Vhembe and Mopani districts should focus on control, while in KwaZulu-Natal Province eliminating transmission foci should be prioritized. Cross-border initiatives with neighbouring countries should be established/strengthened as a matter of urgency since malaria importation poses a real threat to the country’s elimination efforts. It is also critical that provincial programmes are adequately resourced to effectively conduct the necessary targeted elimination activities, informed by current vector/parasite distribution and resistance data. More sensitive methods to detect sub-patent infections, primaquine as a transmission-blocking drug, and alternative vector control methods need to be investigated. Knowledge gaps among malaria health workers and affected communities should be identified and addressed.

40|$|The Summary of Notifiable Diseases [...] - United States, 2003 {{contains}} the official statistics, in tabular and graphic form, for the reported occurrence of nationally notifiable diseases in the United States for 2003. Unless otherwise noted, {{the data are}} final totals for 2003 reported as of June 30, 2004. These statistics are collected and compiled from reports sent by state health departments to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS), which is operated by CDC {{in collaboration with the}} Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE). The Summary is available at [URL] This site also includes publications from past years. The Highlights section presents noteworthy epidemiologic and prevention information for 2003 for selected diseases and additional information to aid in the interpretation of surveillance and disease-trend data. Part 1 contains tables showing incidence data for the nationally notifiable diseases during 2003. The tables provide the number of cases reported to CDC for 2003, as well as the distribution of cases by month, geographic location, and the patient's demographic characteristics (age, sex, race, and ethnicity). Nationally notifiable diseases that are reportable in < 40 states do not appear in these tables. Part 2 contains graphs and maps that depict summary data for certain notifiable diseases described in tabular form in Part 1. Part 3 contains tables that list the number of cases of notifiable diseases reported to CDC since 1970. This section also includes a table enumerating deaths associated with specified notifiable diseases reported to CDC's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), during 1996 [...] 2001. The Selected Reading section presents general and disease-specific references for notifiable infectious diseases. These references provide additional <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>surveillance</b> and epidemiologic concerns, diagnostic concerns, and disease control activities.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: In {{response}} to the potential threat of an influenza pandemic, several international institutions and governments, in partnership with African countries, invested {{in the development of}} epidemiologic and laboratory influenza surveillance capacity in Africa and the African Network of Influenza Surveillance and Epidemiology (ANISE) was formed. METHODS: We used a standardized form to collect <b>information</b> <b>on</b> influenza <b>surveillance</b> system characteristics, the number and percent of influenza-positive patients with influenza-like illness (ILI), or severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and virologic data from countries participating in ANISE. RESULTS: Between 2006 and 2010, the number of ILI and SARI sites in 15 African countries increased from 21 to 127 and from 2 to 98, respectively. Children 0 - 4 years accounted for 48 % of all ILI and SARI cases of which 22 % and 10 %, respectively, were positive for influenza. Influenza peaks were generally discernible in North and South Africa. Substantial cocirculation of influenza A and B occurred most years. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza is a major cause of respiratory illness in Africa, especially in children. Further strengthening influenza surveillance, along with conducting special studies on influenza burden, cost of illness, and role of other respiratory pathogens will help detect novel influenza viruses and inform and develop targeted influenza prevention policy decisions in the region...|$|R
40|$|The Emerging Risks Unit (EMRISK) was {{requested}} by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to develop a system for the routine monitoring of data from the Rapid Alert System on Food and Feed (RASFF), with the main objective of detecting potentially relevant patterns of notifications and a timely reporting. The RASFF-Database, maintained by the European Commission (EC), includes detailed <b>information</b> <b>on</b> food safety events notified {{by the members of}} the RASFF-network. EMRISK has developed a system that enables the provision of up-to-date statistics (e. g. frequency tables and graphs) from the RASFF-Database. The core system is based on IT applications to produce alerts of new or re-emerging hazards and ad hoc reports. The IT tools developed are used by EMRISK for its monitoring activities and to provide a fast response to specific requests received from EFSA‟s scientific Units. The evaluation of the RASFF-Database as a potential source of information for the identification of emerging risks indicates that this source of <b>information,</b> largely based <b>on</b> <b>surveillance</b> and inspection programs driven by the existing legislation, can be useful mainly for the identification of re-emerging hazards. Some of the tools developed by EMRISK in this system (e. g. the excel pivot-tool for ad hoc reports) could be useful not only for EFSA, but also for the EC and the Member States to exploit the data notified withi...|$|R
40|$|Louisiana is {{severely}} affected by HIV/AIDS, ranking fifth in AIDS {{rates in the}} USA. The Louisiana Public Health Information Exchange (LaPHIE) is a novel, secure bi-directional public health information exchange, linking statewide public health surveillance data with electronic medical record data. LaPHIE alerts medical providers when individuals with HIV/AIDS who have not received HIV care for > 12  months are seen at any ambulatory or inpatient facility in an integrated delivery network. Between 2 / 1 / 2009 and 1 / 31 / 2011, 488 alerts identified 345 HIV positive patients. Of those identified, 82 % {{had at least one}} CD 4 or HIV viral load test over the study follow-up period. LaPHIE is an innovative use of health <b>information</b> exchange based <b>on</b> <b>surveillance</b> data and real time clinical messaging, facilitating rapid provider notification of those in need of treatment. LaPHIE successfully reduces critical missed opportunities to intervene with individuals not in care, leveraging information historically collected solely for public health purposes, not health care delivery, to improve public health...|$|R
