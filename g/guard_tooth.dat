"I {{am glad to}} {{hear that}} so many of them are saved, though I know not the value of the animals you name; which is nothing uncommon, seeing how long it is that I have been out of the settlements. But can you tell me, friend, what the {{traveller}} carries under the white cloth, he <b>guards</b> with <b>teeth</b> as sharp as a wolf that quarrels for the carcass the hunter has left?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{basic form}} of a razor, [...] "the cutting blade of which is {{at right angles with}} the handle, and resembles {{somewhat}} the {{form of a}} common hoe", was first described in a patent application in 1847 by William S. Henson. This also covered a [...] "comb <b>tooth</b> <b>guard</b> or protector" [...] which could be attached both to the hoe form and to a conventional straight razor.|$|R
40|$|International audienceOur gums (gingiva) {{act as a}} {{significant}} barricade in <b>guarding</b> our <b>teeth</b> and their neighboring support structures. A tiny known fact is that gum disease is the foremost cause of tooth loss in grown persons. Healthy, strong, teeth are reliant on on healthy gums. The core culprit for gum problems is bacteria in dental plaque. The bacteria in plaque yield harmful toxins that generate an inflammatory process that happens in the gum tissue. If left for a sufficient period of time, bacterial plaque causes hurt to our teeth {{as well as our}} gums. In this paper, we present a knowledge based system that help people with teeth and gums problems to diagnose their problems and get recommendation for the treatment. This expert system was designed and implemented using SL 5 Object language for knowledge based system...|$|R
5000|$|Galella {{was once}} beaten by Richard Burton's {{security}} <b>guards,</b> losing one <b>tooth,</b> and sued the actor unsuccessfully. Elizabeth Taylor, who {{tended to be}} tolerant towards photographers, was often heard to mutter, [...] "I'm going to kill Ron Galella!", though the actress would later use his photographs in her biography. Other famous targets were Elvis Presley, whose bodyguards slashed his tires, Brigitte Bardot, being hosed down by her security staff, and Sean Penn, who spat at him and reportedly punched him while being photographed with his then-wife Madonna.|$|R
40|$|The early {{development}} of self-injurious behaviour in three young boys (aged 17, 25, and 30 months at start of study) with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome was examined {{by means of}} parental interviews and by direct observations completed at 3 to 4 monthly intervals over an 18 -month period. Results suggest that the self-injury began {{in a different way}} from that of other young children with autism and/or developmental disabilities in that, from the start, self-injurious responses were sudden and violent, rather than emerging gradually over time. Drastic measures, such as removal of the teeth or provision of <b>tooth</b> <b>guards,</b> were often taken to prevent further tissue damage. Direct observations showed that the boys’self-injury occurred at lower rates, but their carers were highly concerned about the behaviour. Sequential analysis of the observational data indicated that on some occasions the children were more likely to self-injure during periods of low social interaction, suggesting that their self-injury may have been influenced by environmental factors. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{procedure}} {{begins with}} orotracheal intubation using a laser-safe endotracheal tube. The {{eyes of the}} patient are padded and taped followed by draping {{of the head and}} application of upper <b>tooth</b> <b>guard.</b> When the patient is anesthetized sufficiently and full relaxation is seen. The largest feasible laryngoscope is introduced, to obtain {{a good view of the}} larynx. After positioning of the laryngoscope, it is fixed in place with the help of the chest holder. The light carrier is withdrawn after the adjustment of scope in desired position and then the operating microscope is introduced. The head and face of the patient is protected with moist towels. Then the operating microscope fitted with 400 mm lens and a microspot CO2 laser is brought in position. The endotracheal tube cuff is protected by a moist cottonoid sponge placed in subglottis. The site for the cordotomy is determined at the preoperative examination. If any one of the vocal fold seems to have a slightest degree of motion, then cordotomy is performed on the other one. Using CO2 laser with a spot size of 0.2 mm and power of 3-5 Watts, a cordotomy is performed 1-2mm anteriorly to the vocal process. This is then carried laterally to the thyroid lamina through the width of the vocal ligament and vocalis muscle. The cordotomy provides access to the arytenoid cartilage as well as opens the airway posteriorly.|$|R
60|$|Mooka shivered a {{bit when}} {{she remembered the}} uncanny scene, and felt again the strong {{pressure}} of her mother's arms holding her close; but Old Tomah brushed away her fears {{with a smile and}} a word, as he had always done when, as little children, they had showed fear at the thunder or the gale or the cry of a wild beast in the night, till they had grown to look upon all Nature's phenomena as hiding a smile as kindly as that of Old Tomah himself, who had a face wrinkled and terribly grim, to be sure, but who could smile and tell a story so that every child trusted him. The wolves were hungry, starving hungry, he said, and wanted only a dog, or one of the pigs. And Mooka remembered with a bright laugh the two unruly pigs that had been taken inland as a hostage to famine, and that must be carefully <b>guarded</b> from the <b>teeth</b> of hungry prowlers, for they would soon be needed to keep the children themselves from starving. Every night at early sunset, when the trees began to groan and the keen winds from the mountains came whispering through the woods, the two pigs were taken into the snug kitchen, where with the dogs they slept so close to the stove that she could always smell pork a-frying. Not a husky dog there but would have killed and eaten one of these little pigs if he could have caught him {{around the corner of the}} house after nightfall, though you would never have suspected it if you had seen them so close together, keeping each other warm after the fire went out. And besides the dogs and the wolves there were lynxes--big, round-headed, savage-looking creatures--that came prowling out of the deep woods every night, hungry for a taste of the little pigs; and now and then an enormous polar bear, that had landed from an iceberg, would shuffle swiftly and fearlessly among the handful of little cabins, leaving his great footprints in every yard and tearing to pieces, as if made of straw, the heavy log pens to which some of the fishermen had foolishly confided their pigs or sheep. He even entered the woodsheds and rummaged about after a stray fishbone or an old sealskin boot, making a great rowdydow in the still night; and only the smell of man, or the report of an old gun fired at him by some brave woman out of the half-open window, kept him from pushing his enormous weight against the very doors of the cabins.|$|R
