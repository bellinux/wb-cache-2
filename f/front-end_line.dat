Section 3. 1 deals with the so-called <b>Front-End</b> Of <b>Line</b> (FEOL) variations that refer to the variations on the device level. Besides the extrinsic variability that {{is caused by the}} imperfections of the manufacturing process, the intrinsic variability due to atomic-level differences is gaining importance. At the nanoscale level, even an uncertainty of a few atoms may adversely affect the parameters and the behavior of microelectronic devices.

40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} {{here the}} development of PSEC- 3, a custom integrated circuit designed in the IBM- 8 RF 0. 13 μm CMOS process and intended for fast, low-power waveform sampling. As part of the Large-Area Picosecond Photo-Detector (LAPPD) collaboration, this chip has been designed as a prototype application-speciﬁc integrated circuit (ASIC) for the <b>front-end</b> transmission <b>line</b> readout of large-area micro-channel plate photomultiplier tubes (MCP-PMTs). With 4 channels, PSEC- 3 has a buffer depth of 256 samples on each channel, a chip-parallel ramp-compare ADC, and a serial data readout that includes the capability for region-of-interest windowing to reduce dead time. Chip calibrations and performance results, including achieved sampling rates of 2. 5 - 17 GSa/s, are reported. Some design issues are identiﬁed, in particular the dependence of analog bandwidth on location in the sampling array. The causes have been found and addressed in a subsequent PSEC- 4 submission...|$|R

40|$|A 1 / 4 inch VGA 5. 6 µm {{pixel pitch}} {{wide dynamic range}} (WDR) CMOS image sensor with {{resistance}} to high temperatures has been developed using a very-low-dark-current <b>front-end</b> of <b>line</b> (VLDC FEOL), a metal hermetic seal package and/or the inorganic cap layer to suppress the degradation of the spectra response of the on-chip micro lens and color filter (OCML/OCCF). The dark current is reduced to 175 e-/sec-pixel at 85 ˚C (25 e-/sec-pixel at 60 ˚C) {{by the use of}} VLDC FEOL. Sensor chips with no cap and an inorganic cap onto the OCML were assembled into a metal seal package and a conventional package respectively. They were exposed to a 150 ˚C / 500 hours thermal-stress test in the air. No degradation of the spectra response in any of R/G/B pixels for both samples is observed after the thermal stress test. The sample images captured by the WDR CMOS image sensor with and without the thermal stress show no significant degradation in image quality up to 85 ˚C.

40|$|Characterization of {{advanced}} CMOS devices {{and control of}} <b>front-end</b> of <b>line</b> (FEOL) processes require state-of-the-art analytical techniques and specific measurement protocols. Dynamic Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (D-SIMS) is well suited for in-depth quantitative analysis of both bulk- and dopant concentrations in GexSi 1 -x binary alloys. A similar D-SIMS protocol –in combination with Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) – allows monitoring nickel-silicide phase transitions upon silicidation of (doped) Ni Totally Silicided (TOSI) gates. Combination of Low-Energy Electron X-ray Emission Spectroscopy (LEXES) and high-precision DSIMS provides accurate control of dose, junction depth, and wafer uniformity for Ultra-Shallow Junctions (USJ) at high analytical throughput, opening the way to USJ metrology. Similar techniques (LEXES, SIMS) are employed to control wafer uniformity of deposited NiPt metal films as Source/Drain (S/D) contact metal, to monitor NixSi 1 -x phase transformations and Pt-redistribution upon silicidation, and to determine root causes of defectivity at the device level (µ-AES). The given examples demonstrate {{the importance of having}} available (novel) state-of-the-art characterization techniques –pushing the analytical limits in terms of resolution, sensitivity, and accuracy while simultaneously increasing throughput and reproducibility – to support process development, improve yield, and to speed up yield learning {{of advanced}} CMOS processes...|$|R

40|$|The X-ray photo-emission {{monitors}} at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) {{are used}} for beam-position diagnostics and beam stabilization down to the sub-micron level. The main systematic change of the photon beam-position is induced by varying insertion device (ID) settings, such as photon energy, harmonic-selection or light polarization. An ID beam-position correction scheme is based on digital beam-position monitors (DBPM) located inside the storage ring, combined with analogue Bergoz BPMs, located inside the ID straight section, and analogue photon monitors (XBPMs), in beam <b>line</b> <b>front-ends.</b> The use of XBPMs in this correction scheme will be demonstrated. Moreover, {{in order to achieve}} sub-micron photon-beam stability while changing the ID parameters with XBPM-readouts requires precise XBPM alignment and characterization for each ID-setting [1 - 2]. We present an account of the design and performance of the XBPMs as used for characterizing systematic effects of the U 19, and the more challenging elliptical undulator UE 44 [3], a newly designed fixed-gap APPLE II undulator recently installed at the advanced resonant spectroscopy beam line [4]...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the {{development}} of new micromechanical switches as MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) products for use in a variety of communication-applications. The research work performed within the frame of this thesis on the ´RF-switch´ (radio-frequency switch) is used to demonstrate the importance of an ´integrated design and development approach´ for a product-development. The successful realization, not only from a technological but also from an economic perspective, can only be achieved by considering all aspects of production for the entire end-to-end process, starting with the definition of the initial device-concept. Therefore an optimized integration of the <b>front-end</b> of <b>line</b> (FE-) processing and the back-end of line (BE-) processing together with the device packaging {{at the very end of}} the fabrication sequence has to be realized. The RF-switches are produced using a newly developed semiconductor process combination. First a poly-Si surface micromachining (SMM) process is used to create the mechanical switch-structure. Afterwards the special metal contacts are formed using additive electroplating technology (AET) in order to establish the electrically functional switch. The switch-element is then protected from the environment with a waferlevel-packaging scheme, before the individual device can be mounted into an SMD-package. The scientific focus of this thesis is marked by the device-concept for the RF-switch and the development of the end-to-end production process within the fab. The development of newly designed processing steps was required for this, which also included the challenging task of integrating these individual processing clusters and steps with each other within the production line. An analysis and characterization of the fabricated devices demonstrates the successful production capability. A discussion of the promising growth-potential for MEMS-products and RF-switches in particular is included in the appendix...|$|R
40|$|Process {{technology}} and environment-induced variability of gates and wires in VLSI circuits make timing analyses of such circuits a challenging task. Process variation {{can have a}} significant impact on both device (<b>front-end</b> of the <b>line)</b> and interconnect (back-end of the line) performance. Statistical static timing analysis techniques are being developed to tackle this important problem. Existing timing analysis tools divide the analysis into interconnect (wire) timing analysis and gate timing analysis. In this paper, we focus on statistical static timing analysis of coupled interconnects where crosstalk noise analysis is unavoidable. We propose a new framework for handling the effect of Gaussian and Non-Gaussian process variations on coupled interconnects. The technique allows for closed-form computation of interconnect delay probability density functions (PDFs) given variations in relevant process parameters such as the line width, metal thickness, and dielectric thickness in the presence of crosstalk noise. To achieve this goal, we express the electrical parameters of the coupled interconnects in a first order (linear) form as function of changes in physical parameters and subsequently use these forms to perform accurate timing and noise analysis to produce the propagation delay and slew in the first-order forms. This work can be easily extended to consider the effect of higher order terms of the sources of variation. Experimental results show that the proposed method is capable of accurately predicting delay variation in a coupled interconnect line...|$|R
40|$|CMOS scaling has outpaced {{manufacturing}} technology advancements, and consequently process variability continues to increase. Manufacturing non-idealities induce variations in lateral dimensions and topography, stress variations, and material variations. These are manifested as circuit delay and power variations, and consequently low parametric yield, {{which is the}} percentage of chips that, though functional, fail to meet delay and power specifications. Design for manufacturing (DFM) refers to measures taken during design to enhance yield. Traditional DFM techniques are essentially geometric operations with limited electrical interactions or awareness. These include resolution enhancement techniques to improve fidelity of optical lithography, design rule checks to restrict the use of layout patterns not amenable to manufacturing, and guardbanding to keep margins for process variability in design. As the extent and complexity of process variations increases, and suboptimality due to conservative design threatens to offset the benefits of scaling, these traditional DFM techniques, while still crucial, are no longer adequate. DFM techniques to improve parametric yield can be classified according to their approach. A considerable fraction of variability is systematic in nature and can be predicted using layout and process knowledge. Examples of such variations are pitch-dependent lithography variations and layout-dependent stress effects. These variations can be predicted and compensated for in physical design to improve yield. A second class of DFM techniques enhances design robustness to process variations. Examples include gate length biasing and redundant link insertion in clock trees, which respectively reduce leakage and clock skew variations even when the gate length variability remains the same. A third class of parametric yield-directed DFM techniques reduces process variations themselves, and includes dummy fill insertion and {{the increased use of}} layout pattern regularity. In this thesis we propose novel DFM techniques that explicitly target parametric yield. We present three techniques for analysis and optimization of circuit leakage and delay that are knowledgeable of systematic lithography variations due to pitch, defocus, and lens aberration. Stress variations, due to width of shallow trench isolation (STI) wells, can lead to considerable delay variations. We propose timing analysis and optimization methodologies to account for STI width- dependent stress, which is highly systematic in nature. Variations in gate length arising from a variety of process variations are a major cause of leakage variability, an important problem being faced by the designers today. We propose gate length biasing, which leverages the threshold voltage roll-off to significantly reduce leakage and its variability. The technique is non- obtrusive to existing flows, easy to adopt, and inexpensive to manufacture. We also present our contributions to <b>front-end</b> of the <b>line</b> (FEOL) and back-end of the line (BEOL) fill. Our FEOL insertion methodology considerably improves topography after chemical mechanical polishing for STI and may avoid the need for reverse- etchback process steps. In BEOL fill insertion, a primary concern is the capacitive impact of inserted fill and the corresponding increase of delay and crosstalk. We describe a systematic study of the capacitive impact of inserted fill, and develop guidelines that reduce capacitive impact without sacrificing metal densit...|$|R
