In this reverie, his eyes affixed on the zodiac, Dionis understands that he can freely travel back into the glorified past. He chooses for his destination ancient Moldavia, {{under the rule of}} Prince Alexander the Good. When he awakens, he finds himself on a meadow near Iași, dressed in Orthodox monastic clothes, and grasping the almanac.

25|$|Monáe {{was born}} in Kansas City, Kansas, where she spent her early years. She is the {{daughter}} of a janitor mother and a truck driver father, Michael Robinson Summers. She <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> a singer and a performer from a very young age, and has cited the fictional character of Dorothy Gale from The Wizard of Oz as a musical influence. She moved to New York City to study drama at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy, attending a performing arts camp called Freedom Theatre, the oldest African-American theatre in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2001, she met OutKast's Big Boi, and then founded the Wondaland Arts Society with some like-minded young artists. She released her first EP The Audition in 2003. Although it did not place highly on the Billboard charts – reportedly only 400 physical copies were pressed – it did showcase her vocal abilities and unique Metropolis concept that would also figure in her future releases. The CD album itself is extremely rare in its original compact disc format, and as such is a valuable collector's item.|$|E

500|$|Kove {{originally}} {{wanted to}} make the film biographical, based on a story her father told her: he had <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> an artist, and made an appointment with an art teacher to ask if he was good enough {{to make it in the}} art world. However, he stood at the top of the stairs and decided not to go, eventually deciding to go to architecture school (as his parents wanted) where he met his wife. Kove's inspiration was drawn from the fact that her existence seemed to hinge on that decision, because [...] "if the artist had said, 'Oh, you must paint,' you know, then in all likelihood he would never have met my mother, and, you know, that would have been it for my chances." [...] However, Kove felt the story was too personal, and rewrote it to be fictional.|$|E

When asked about her favorite Disney character, Bell said, [...] "Ariel from The Little Mermaid.

500|$|The {{context of}} [...] "Part of Your World" [...] {{and the fact}} that it occurs before Ariel meets and falls in love with Eric is often used to defend Ariel against critics who accuse her of sacrificing her talents for a man. Boing Boings Caroline Siede {{explained}} that Ariel [...] "just happens to end up with a prince in the process of achieving her larger dream" [...] to become human. Similarly, Sophie Katz of The Odyssey Online wrote that the song proves that Ariel [...] "doesn’t give up her voice only for a guy. She already wanted to be 'part of that world.' The prince was a bonus." [...] Writing for Yahoo! Movies, Gwynne Watkins penned [...] "There’s little doubt that Ariel’s crush on Prince Eric strengthens her resolve to be part of the human world. But crucially, her love of 'the world above' is established long before she sets eyes on the prince" [...] during [...] "Part of Your World". Laura Stampler, writing for Time, agreed that the character [...] " [...] in love with the human world before she even knew who Eric was" [...] because [...] "she has always <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> a 'part of your world'". Ariel sings [...] "Bright young women, sick of swimmin’, ready to stand" [...] to indicate that she fantasizes about [...] "living in a feminist-friendly society where she can speak her mind freely and grow intellectually", demonstrating envy towards women who are capable of doing this on land. However, Times Laura Stampler joked that Ariel will find the human world disappointing [...] "considering my dad definitely still reprimanded me (even though I had legs)." [...] In the reprise, the lyrics [...] "Part of that world" [...] are replaced with [...] "part of your world" [...] to distinguish that the character is now referring to her feelings for Eric, whom Ariel had not yet met when she sang the original song.|$|E
