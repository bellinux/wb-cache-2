40|$|Purpose: To {{report a}} novel {{magnetic}} resonance imaging measure (diffusion orientational complexity [DOC]) {{in a study of}} people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and healthy controls and to determine patterns of abnormality, correlations with conventional diffusion measures, and associations with cognitive function. Materials and Methods: We performed high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) and measured DOC, mean diffusivity (MD), and fractional anisotropy (FA) in 51 MS patients and 28 healthy controls. All subjects had a 2 -mm isotropic HARDI scan on a 3 T scanner using a 32 -channel <b>head</b> <b>receiver</b> coil. DOC, MD, and FA were measured in three regions of interest (ROIs) in frontal cortex linked to executive function, two ROIs in occipital cortex thought unlikely to affect cognition, and in the whole cortex. Results: Frontal cortex DOC was significantly decreased in MS patients. DOC correlated mostly with FA but not MD in controls and with MD but not FA in people with MS. In regression models that included all three diffusion-based measures, frontal cortex DOC and frontal cortex FA independently predicted executive function scores. Conclusion: DOC is a new useful measure of functionally relevant cortical pathology in MS, providing information that complements conventional diffusion measures...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} whether unenhanced high-resolution T 2 -weighted fast spin-echo MR imaging provides an acceptable {{and less expensive}} alternative to contrast-enhanced conventional T 1 -weighted spin-echo MR techniques in the diagnosis of acoustic schwannoma. METHODS: We reviewed {{in a blinded fashion}} the records of 25 patients with pathologically documented acoustic schwannoma and of 25 control subjects, all of whom had undergone both enhanced conventional spin-echo MR imaging and unenhanced fast spin-echo MR imaging of the cerebellopontine angle/ internal auditory canal region. The patients were imaged {{with the use of a}} quadrature <b>head</b> <b>receiver</b> coil for the conventional spin-echo sequences and dual 3 -inch phased-array receiver coils for the fast spin-echo sequences. RESULTS: The size of the acoustic schwannomas ranged from 2 to 40 mm in maximum dimension. The mean maximum diameter was 12 mm, and 12 neoplasms were less than 10 mm in diameter. Acoustic schwannoma was correctly diagnosed on 98 % of the fast spin-echo images and on 100 % of the enhanced conventional spin-echo images. Statistical analysis of the data using the � coefficient demonstrated agreement beyond chance between these two imaging techniques for the diagnosis of acoustic schwannoma. CONCLUSIONS: There is no statistically significant difference in the sensitivity and specificity of unenhanced high-resolution fast spin-echo imaging and enhanced T 1 -weighted conventional spin-echo imaging in the detection of acoustic schwannoma. We believe that the unenhanced high-resolution fast spin-echo technique provides a cost-effective method for the diagnosis of acoustic schwannoma...|$|E

50|$|A wheel {{route is}} a pattern run by a {{receiver}} or running back in American football.

3000|$|... that {{satisfies}} {{these conditions}} {{is called a}} feasible schedule. Each cluster is assumed to have a dedicated sink node, or cluster head. Similar to a Bluetooth system [1, Chapter 5], the cluster <b>head</b> is the <b>receiver</b> of all transmissions from all nodes in a cluster. The scheduling is performed by a central entity that is connected to all sinks. While these settings resemble a cellular network architecture, the scheduling techniques developed for cellular networks are not applicable here. This {{is due to the}} fact that in cellular networks, power and rate control are essential part of the scheduling problem. While in wireless sensor networks, the on-off power control is preferred, which results in a fundamentally different problem formulation.|$|R

Typical Watsu moves use turbulent drag to produce traction and softly stretch the limbs and torso. Movements include slow rocking, arm and leg stretches, trunk rotations and stretches, and various oscillation and pulsing patterns. Moves are repeated on both sides for balance.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{methodology}} for adapting existing wireless ad hoc network protocols to power controlled networks is presented. Wireless nodes {{are assumed to}} have transmission power control with m discrete levels, and a clustering scheme {{is used in the}} adaptation to be energy efficient. Clusters are formed among the nodes in a distributed selforganized manner so that each node is a member of some cluster and within a cluster, each node can reach any other node with appropriate power level. Each cluster has a designated head node which acts as forwarding agent for its members and these head nodes form a supernode topology. We adapt an ad hoc network multicast protocol by executing it on this supernode topology. Multicast data will move from the sender to its cluster head, then along the supernode topology according to the results of the chosen multicast protocol, and finally from cluster <b>head</b> to <b>receivers</b> within their clusters. At every step, nodes use appropriate power level, 1 j m, to reach all the intended recipients. For more balanced way of depleting energy in the network, nodes take turn to become cluster heads. We applied our technique to ODMRP and the experiement shows siginifcant energy reduction. 1...|$|R

40|$|To {{construct}} a compact THz-TDS system equipped with movable emitter and <b>receiver</b> <b>heads,</b> a specific fiber-delivery system is developed to deliver ultra-short pulses from Ti: sapphire laser through a single-mode fiber. Hence, {{how to manage}} the dispersion in fiber-delivery system efficiently becomes {{one of the most}} important issues to be solved. In this paper, the theoretical calculation of dispersion in fiber-delivery system was discussed initially. And also, a pair of gratings, which can generate negative group velocity dispersion (GVD), was introduced to compensate the positive dispersion in fiber. A minimum temporal width of pulse about 60 fs was measured at the end of the fiber-delivery system by optimizing the relative position of gratings. The experimental result agreed well to the theoretical calculation and demonstrated the advantages of the fiber-delivery system. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier GmbH.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} thesis {{deals with}} a long range free space optical links for communication over the distance of few tens of kilometers in the atmosphere. The problematic of the beam propagation and atmospheric effects influencing the beam {{and the quality of}} the communication protocol are discussed.

30|$|We {{consider}} a face-to-face videoconferencing system {{that uses a}} Kinect camera {{at each end of}} the link for 3 D modeling and an ordinary 2 D display for output. The Kinect camera allows a 3 D model of each participant to be transmitted; the (assumed static) background is sent separately. Furthermore, the Kinect tracks the <b>receiver’s</b> <b>head,</b> allowing our system to render a view of the sender depending on the receiver’s viewpoint. The resulting motion parallax gives the receivers a strong impression of 3 D viewing as they move, yet the system only needs an ordinary 2 D display. This is cheaper than a full 3 D system, and avoids disadvantages such as the need to wear shutter glasses, VR headsets, or to sit in a particular position required by an autostereo display. Perceptual studies show that users experience a greater sensation of depth with our system compared to a typical 2 D videoconferencing system.|$|R

40|$|Agriculture is {{the sector}} with the {{greatest}} water consumption, since food production is frequently based on crop irrigation. Proper irrigation management requires reliable information on plant water status, but all the plant-based methods to determine it suffer from several inconveniences, mainly caused by the necessity of destructive sampling or of alteration of the plant organ due to contact installation.

5000|$|The conk (derived from congolene, a hair {{straightener}} gel made from lye) was a hairstyle popular among African-American {{men from the}} 1920s to the 1960s. This hairstyle called {{for a man with}} naturally [...] "kinky" [...] hair to have it chemically straightened using a relaxer (sometimes the pure corrosive chemical lye), so that the newly straightened hair could be styled in specific ways. Often, the relaxer was made at home, by mixing lye, eggs, and potatoes, the applier having to wear gloves and the <b>receiver's</b> <b>head</b> having to be rinsed thoroughly after application to avoid chemical burns. Conks were often styled as large pompadours although other men chose to simply slick their straightened hair back, allowing it to lie flat on their heads. Regardless of the styling, conks required a considerable amount of effort to maintain: a man often had to wear a do-rag of some sort at home, to absorb sweat or other agents from causing his hair to revert to its natural state prematurely. Also, the style required repeated application of relaxers; as new hair grew in, it too had to be chemically straightened.|$|R
