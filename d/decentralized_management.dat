30|$|In {{addition}} to centralized and <b>decentralized</b> energy <b>management</b> schemes, {{a combination of}} these schemes will produce a hybrid centralized and decentralized scheme. In this hybrid strategy, DGs are divided into groups. In each group, centralized scheme is used, which is responsible for local optimization within group. Among different groups, <b>decentralized</b> energy <b>management</b> scheme is utilized for global optimization. Such a hybrid strategy could be suitable for large systems with interconnected microgrids, where centralize control of each microgrid and decentralized coordination among microgrids could improve reliability and resilience of the system.

40|$|Summary Based on {{a village}} study in Tanzania, {{the effects of}} <b>decentralized</b> forest <b>management</b> on forest conservation, rural {{livelihoods}} and good governance are evaluated. Tree growth is estimated to exceed harvest, and forest utilization appears effectively controlled. Forest revenues {{cover the costs of}} management and finance local public services, but the underlying taxes and regulations have made the poorest worse off. Governance outcomes are also ambiguous. Revenues are administered transparently, but village leaders are coercive toward forest dependent minorities. The case provides a rare example of how <b>decentralized</b> forest <b>management</b> works in Africa when meaningful powers are devolved to local communities.

25|$|China {{has adopted}} a variety of {{measures}} to promote its foreign economic relations, maximizing the role of imports, exports, and foreign capital in economic development. Foreign trade organizations were reorganized, and control of imports and exports was relaxed or strengthened depending on the balance of trade {{and the level of}} foreign exchange reserves. Heavy purchases of foreign plants and equipment resulted in import restraint from 1980 to 1983. Because of the expansion of exports in the mid-1980s, a large foreign reserve surplus, and the <b>decentralized</b> <b>management</b> of foreign trade, imports surged. Huge, uncontrolled purchases of consumer goods led to trade deficits in 1984 and 1985, resulting in the introduction of an import and export licensing system, stricter controls on foreign exchange expenditures, and the devaluation of the yuan {{in order to reduce the}} trade deficit and ensure that machinery, equipment, and semi-finished goods, rather than consumer goods, were imported. In 1985 China had foreign exchange reserves of US$11.9 billion.|$|E

40|$|Changes in our {{electricity}} supply chain are causing {{a paradigm shift}} from centralized control towards <b>decentralized</b> energy <b>management.</b> Within the framework of <b>decentralized</b> energy <b>management,</b> devices that offer flexibility in their load profile play an important role. These devices schedule their flexible load profile based on steering signals received from centralized controllers. The problem of finding optimal device schedules based on the received steering signals falls into the framework of resource allocation problems. We study {{an extension of the}} traditional problems studied within resource allocation and prove that a divide-and-conquer strategy gives an optimal solution for the considered extension. This leads to an efficient recursive algorithm, with quadratic complexity in the practically relevant case of quadratic objective functions. Furthermore, we study discrete variants of two problems common in <b>decentralized</b> energy <b>management.</b> We show that these problems are NP-hard and formulate natural relaxations of both considered discrete problems that we solve efficiently. Finally, we show that the solutions to the natural relaxations closely resemble solutions to the original, hard problems...|$|R

Research on the private sector shows large-scale change, such as decentralization, cannot be simply installed. Rather it unfolds over time through a gradual learning process. Therefore, the transition to SBM is best approached by establishing structures and processes that enable groups of people to discuss new directions, try new approaches, and learn from them.
