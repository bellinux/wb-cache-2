5|$|Although the {{majority}} of <b>his</b> <b>works</b> were in Polish, he tried his hand at several works in French language (Le roi de Landawa, Beatrice Cenci). Many of <b>his</b> <b>works</b> were published only posthumously, often under arbitrary titles, as Słowacki never named them himself. He also left notes on works that he never began or never completed. Słowacki is also considered the father of modern Polish drama.|$|E
5|$|As <b>his</b> <b>works</b> {{have sold}} since the 2010s, Invader adopted a new {{strategy}} to avoid them being removed. In late 2015, Invader planned a series of art pieces in New York City, putting out a call on social media for building owners who {{would be willing to}} host his mosaics legally. In addition, he has chosen sites with architectural features restricting access. Also, <b>his</b> <b>works</b> may be larger and use more delicate tiles so that they cannot be removed undamaged.|$|E

5|$|Outside Poland, Sienkiewicz's {{popularity}} declined {{beginning in}} the interbellum, except for Quo Vadis, which retained relative fame thanks to several film adaptations, including a notable American one in 1951.

5|$|Translations of <b>his</b> <b>works</b> are {{difficult}} due to passages with elaborate word formation, alien or robotic poetry, and puns.|$|E
5|$|After his death, Gasparo's {{reputation}} {{fell into}} oblivion caused by unfavourable secular criticism. His complex artistic personality and catalog of works were only reconstructed {{from the end}} of the twentieth century, thanks to targeted critical studies that have for the first time allowed a thorough analysis and rediscovery of <b>his</b> <b>works.</b>|$|E
5|$|Already in his {{lifetime}} <b>his</b> <b>works</b> were adapted for theatrical, operatic and musical presentations and for the emerging film industry. Writers and poets devoted works to him, or used him or <b>his</b> <b>works</b> as inspiration. Painters created works inspired by Sienkiewicz's novels, and their works were gathered in Sienkiewicz-themed albums and exhibitions. The names of his characters were given {{to a variety of}} products. The popularity of Quo Vadis in France, where it was the best-selling book of 1900, is shown by the fact that horses competing in a Grand Prix de Paris event were named for characters in the book. In the United States, Quo Vadis sold 800,000 copies in eighteen months. To avoid intrusive journalists and fans, Sienkiewicz sometimes traveled incognito.|$|E
50|$|Hyppolite, a {{prolific}} painter, typically depicted Vodou scenes and created between 250 and 600 paintings {{during the last}} three years of his life.

However, after retiring from <b>his</b> <b>work</b> as a houngan, <b>his</b> <b>work</b> reflected the darker aspects of Haitian vodoo. He died at about age 54 in Haiti's capital city, Port-au-Prince.|$|R
50|$|He {{is known}} for his {{contributions}} to economics, particularly <b>his</b> <b>work</b> on poverty and the middle class, which documents that a thriving middle class and low rates of poverty require substantial redistributive efforts {{on the part of the}} government; <b>his</b> <b>work</b> applying the principles of Post Keynesian economics to microeconomic policy issues; <b>his</b> <b>work</b> on tax and redistribution policy and <b>his</b> <b>work</b> on the Tableau Économique.|$|R
50|$|Stamos never {{recovered}} as an artist. Galleries {{on the level}} of Emmerich or the pre-scandal Marlborough would not represent <b>his</b> <b>work.</b> The lack of support from top galleries gave collectors a lesser sense of security regarding the value of <b>his</b> <b>work</b> and, possibly with general assessments of <b>his</b> <b>work</b> as an artist, caused <b>his</b> <b>work</b> to be perceived as low, second-tier or third-rank Abstract Expressionism by 1998.|$|R
5|$|Bizet's {{marriage}} to Geneviève Halévy was intermittently happy and produced one son. After his death, his work, apart from Carmen, was generally neglected. Manuscripts were given away or lost, and published versions of <b>his</b> <b>works</b> were frequently revised and adapted by other hands. He founded no school {{and had no}} obvious disciples or successors. After years of neglect, <b>his</b> <b>works</b> began to be performed more frequently in the 20th century. Later commentators have acclaimed him as a composer of brilliance and originality whose premature death was a significant loss to French musical theatre.|$|E
5|$|Busoni gave many (but not all) of <b>his</b> <b>works</b> opus numbers; {{some numbers}} apply {{to more than}} one work (after the {{composer}} dropped some of his earlier works from his acknowledged corpus). Nor are the composer's numbers all in temporal order. The musicologist Jürgen Kindermann has prepared a thematic catalogue of <b>his</b> <b>works</b> and transcriptions which is also used, {{in the form of the}} letters BV (for Busoni Verzeichnis, German:Busoni Index: sometimes the letters KiV for Kindermann Verzeichnis are used) followed by an identifier, to identify his compositions and transcriptions. The identifier B (for Bearbeitung, German: arrangement) is used for Busoni's transcriptions and cadenzas– e.g. BV B 1 refers to Busoni's cadenzas for Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4.|$|E
5|$|Chisholm's Neoclassical Period {{refers to}} several of <b>his</b> <b>works</b> which were {{inspired}} by ancient and obscure motifs from the pre-Classical era.

5|$|David John Cawdell Irving (born 24 March 1938) is an English Holocaust denier {{and author}} {{who has written}} on the {{military}} and political history of World War II, {{with a focus on}} Nazi Germany. <b>His</b> <b>works</b> include The Destruction of Dresden (1963), Hitler's War (1977), Churchill's War (1987), and Goebbels: Mastermind of the Third Reich (1996). In <b>his</b> <b>works,</b> he argued that Hitler did not know of the extermination of Jews or, if he did, opposed it. Though Irving's revisionist views of World War II were never taken seriously by mainstream historians, he was once recognised for his knowledge of Nazi Germany and his ability to unearth new historical documents.|$|E
