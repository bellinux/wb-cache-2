In addition, sigmai values were found to depend on whether the boundary layer approaching the step was laminar or turbulent. Generally sigmai values for turbulent case were lower...|$|R
25|$|Eddies are formed, like hydraulics, on the <b>downstream</b> <b>face</b> of an obstruction. Unlike hydraulics, eddies swirl on the {{horizontal}} {{surface of the}} water. Typically, they are calm spots where the downward movement of water is partially or fully arrested—a nice place to rest or to make one's way upstream. However, in very powerful water, eddies can have powerful, swirling currents which can flip boats and from which escape can be very difficult.|$|E
25|$|Indigenous {{plants have}} been planted on the <b>downstream</b> <b>face</b> of the dam wall, {{ensuring}} that the dam blends with the surrounding landscape. Parallel to the dam's construction alien vegetation {{was removed from the}} upper river catchment, significantly increasing the amount of water available for storage and for indigenous plant species. The scheme was designed to maintain the ecological integrity of the river, including through the release of specific volumes of water for this purpose. The releases of low flows and high flows coincide as closely as possible with natural flows. The outlet works of the dam have been designed for a peak release of up to 200 m³ per second, making it the first dam in South Africa where provision is made for flood releases for environmental purposes.|$|E
25|$|Montana Power resumed {{building}} the structure in March 1916. The reason for resuming construction was to supply {{power to the}} Butte, Anaconda and Pacific Railway and the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad. The Chas. T. Main company (whose Western Office was in Butte, Montana) was hired to revisit the design. Henry A. Herrick, {{an employee of the}} power company, was the consulting engineer for Main. The major change implemented by Main and Herrick was to install vertical rather than horizontal turbines, although some changes were made to the wastewater system and the dam's <b>downstream</b> <b>face.</b> Stone & Webster continued to be the construction company, and more than 500 men worked on the project. The S. Morgan Smith Company of York, Pennsylvania, designed the water wheels for the turbines. The 1916-1918 construction camp was the largest ever built by Montana Power. There were more than 115 buildings at the construction site, including a bunkhouse and dormitories for unmarried men, cottages for married men, a dining hall, a bathing house, storage sheds, garages, a photography studio, school, hospital, and sewer. Although most of the structures were tents or wooden buildings intended for short-term use, seven of the structures were renovated into permanent housing for the dam's operators. Two more homes were built for operators after construction ended. Montana Power spent $1.3 million in 1916 and $1.5 million in 1917 to finish the dam. Holter was completed and brought online for power generation in 1918. It was the sixth and last dam completed by the company in that decade.|$|E
50|$|Soon {{after the}} dam began {{operations}} in 1931, its penstock partially collapsed. To prevent {{this from happening}} again, TVA has significantly lowered the water level in the reservoir when it conducts periodic dam inspections (approximately once every five years), which require dewatering of the penstock. A project was initiated in 2010 to repair the penstock, stabilize the intake tower base, and repair and stabilize the upstream and <b>downstream</b> <b>faces</b> of the dam, thus eliminating the future need for severe reservoir drawdowns.|$|R

30|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{calibrated}} hydrogeological model and the known geomechanical properties of the materials, dam stability calculations were completed for different scenarios considering different reservoir levels and varying seismic conditions. The unlikely (and almost impossible) cases either of totally empty or of an overtopping reservoir produced the lowest factor of safety, respectively, for the upstream and <b>downstream</b> <b>faces.</b> The possible case of a seismic load of ah[*]=[*] 0.3  g, av[*]=[*] 0.15  g impacting the dam under routine conditions could also cause its partial instability.|$|R
500|$|In {{arch dam}} design, two basic shapes are adopted. These are the constant–radius arch and the constant-angle arch, the latter design is more complex. In the constant-radius arch design, {{which is also}} known as the single-radius arch, the shape of the dam is {{cylindrical}} with vertical upstream face while the <b>downstream</b> <b>face</b> is battered. The constant-angle arch design has also a variable–radius arch. In this design, the central opening angle is constant whereas the arch radius increases from the base to the crest; this increase towards the crest is proportional to the increase of the canyon width of the gorge. Further, according to the theory of constant-arch design, the arch action {{at the base of the}} dam exerts the maximum pressure on the base. A [...] "V" [...] shaped gorge in particular is considered an ideal feature for building this type of dam. This design ensures substantial savings in use of construction material as opposed to the constant–radius arch design. Lars R. Jorgenson who had conceived this concept had proved that the most economic design of the dam was obtained with an optimum opening angle of 133.6°, with the least quantity of concrete. This design was applied with some modifications for the Salmon Creek Dam, which was designed with constant opening angle of 113° with radius varying from [...] at the base to [...] at the crest.|$|E

50|$|The dam was {{constructed}} with a high-quality concrete designed to withstand constant thawing and freezing associated with its environment. To further help the structure {{cope with the}} climate, engineers placed one-inch steel reinforcing bars within the upstream and <b>downstream</b> <b>faces</b> of the dam. The concrete's strength in compression was initially 4,500 lbs. per square inch to meet an estimated 1,500 PSI within the structure. The upstream face of the dam was also coated in asphalt for protection against water. Despite {{the strength of the}} dam's concrete, two parallel inclined cracks were discovered on one of the arches shortly after construction.|$|R

These tables have been obtained using a regression of the design parameters of an arch-gravity dam with a minimum concrete volume, placed in a large number of valleys with different characteristics and properties. Elasticites for these design parameters are also discussed...|$|R

Both faces {{leading up to the}} crest were vertical for the final [...] On the <b>downstream</b> <b>face,</b> this vertical section was fashioned into [...] wide sections. A portion of these made up the spillway, which consisted of 11 panels in total divided into two groups. Each spillway section had an open area that was [...] high and [...] wide for the overflow to pass. The dam also had five [...] diameter outlet pipes through the center section which were controlled by slide gates attached to the upstream face.|$|E
2500|$|The dam is [...] {{high and}} its cost was {{estimated}} in 1962 at US$60,000,000 (about $443.5 million in 2010 inflated-adjusted dollars). It {{was one of}} a series of very high dams built in Europe in the two decades after World War II; these were designed with a <b>downstream</b> <b>face</b> inclined toward the upstream flow. This simplified the dam's design and construction (although it required more concrete to build), and more readily incorporated the spillways into the dam face. The dam's face is nearly vertical. Design work on the dam began in 1956, and construction completed in 1963. The structure was built by the Iberdrola Ingeniería y Construcción construction firm. Pedro Martínez Artola was the design engineer. The dam was built on high-quality granite rock. During construction, grouting was used to fill cracks in the rock which ran parallel to the dam's foundation, and on the Portuguese bank where two fractures in the rock occurred.|$|E
2500|$|Construction {{began on}} Black Eagle Dam in 1890. GFWPTC {{engineers}} designed a rock-and-timber crib weir overflow dam, in which dressed and shaped heavy timbers formed a closed structure filled with rock or rubble. The dam {{was not a}} large one. The goal was to merely create a pond behind the dam, which would create enough water pressure (or [...] "head") to turn turbines and generate electricity. The dam was built {{at a cost of}} about $515,000 (roughly $12,335,000 in inflation-adjusted 2010 dollars) on the upstream brink of the falls (to create the deepest reservoir possible). Construction bids were opened on February 5, 1890, with the request for bids specifying that all work must be finished by December 1, 1890. All the bids were rejected, and mechanical engineer Maurice Parker was employed to design and construct the dam. Coffer dams were constructed in April 1890 to divert the river from the work areas. Work on the dam itself began on April 15. A shanty town named [...] "River Bank" [...] was constructed just upstream of the construction site on the north bank for the river to house the Croat, Scandinavian, Slovak, and Welsh workers who helped construct the dam. (Most of these workers helped found the town of Black Eagle, and earthen foundations for the shanty town can still be seen.) The red sandstone riverbed was leveled as much as possible, and large timbers bolted and cemented (perpendicular to the river's flow) to the rock. Each timber was [...] from the next one downstream, and six cribs were built to form a dam [...] deep at its base. The dam's <b>downstream</b> <b>face</b> had a pitch of 1.05:1. From the crest of the dam, a face (at a pitch of 1:08:1) extended for about [...] before it became vertical. A [...] masonry wall was built on the south end of the dam to form the foundation of and to protect the powerhouse, and the construction worked inward from either end of the dam. Every [...] across the face of the dam, a [...] floodwater spillway made of concrete was created (for a total of eight spillways). Flashboards [...] in height were installed along the entire top of the dam to add water storage capacity. The dam was [...] high and [...] long.|$|E

This rehabilitation project aimed to repair the dam penstock and to stabilize both the upstream and <b>downstream</b> <b>faces</b> of the dam. The project reduced the water level in the lake to approximately 1630 {{feet above sea level}} around the middle of October 2010 and the portion of work requiring the drawdown was completed in April 2011 when refilling of the lake began. However, TVA decided to hold the lake level at 1,672 feet through the summer of 2012 due to unexpected ground movement experienced in March 2012.|$|R

40|$|The visual {{examination}} of <b>downstream</b> <b>faces</b> of hydro- dams {{is an important}} component in their monitoring. Few computer vision algorithms exist for this task. Some of them aim to detect and evaluate concrete cracks using edge detection. Other problems can also affect hydro-dams, as roughness, scratches, and can lead in time to surface deterioration. These are not currently reliably addressed by image analysis. The proposed fuzzy edge detection and classification scheme can assist the human expert in the visual inspection for crack examination and non-critical surface faults. To differentiate between them we use a fuzzy c-means classifier on the edge strengths, which are found using Sobel edge detection and enhanced through a fuzzy algorithm. The scheme is validated through experiments on different images. The resulting edge maps emphasize superficial faults or cracks, depending on the user’s selection, providing more accurate results than classical edge detection. ...|$|R

Autoignition limits, defined directly by visual observations and indirectly by measured wall pressure and temperature, are compared with a semi-empirical ignition limit model which accounts for first order effects on autoignition. It is shown that to initiate combustion in the immediate region of the fuel injector, ignition must occur in the separation region ahead of the fuel jet. Autoignition within this separation zone exhibits strong dependence on flow pressure and temperature, injector diameter, local boundary layer energy thickness, wall temperature, and on fluid dynamic interactions with adjacent <b>downstream</b> <b>facing</b> steps (such as inlet isolation steps). Secondary effects are also discussed. The empirical model is used to define limits of test temperature, pressure, and scale required for autoignition in a current subscale engine test program...|$|R

The principal data are in the form of Helium concentration profiles at seven axial stations, Mach number distributions at three axial stations and schlieren photographs of the flow field at different interjet spacings. An approximate analysis was developed based upon a linearization in the Von Mises plane, Crocco integrals for the temperature and concentrations fields and an eddy viscosity model. Good agreement with the data was achieved. It was found that, at these conditions, interjet spacing has an effect on mixing only up to S/D of approximately 2. 5, with concentration of injectant becoming smaller as S/D is increased, and the Mach number downstream of the injector tends to decrease with decreasing S/D...|$|R
5000|$|The dam project {{involves}} a large underground power house and transformers chamber, largely completed {{into the left}} abutment.

5|$|Unlike {{other data}} buses (e.g., Ethernet, HDMI), USB {{connections}} are directed, with both {{upstream and downstream}} ports emanating from a single host. This applies to electrical power, with only <b>downstream</b> <b>facing</b> ports providing power; this topology was chosen to easily prevent electrical overloads and damaged equipment. Thus, USB cables have different ends: A and B, with different physical connectors for each. Therefore, in general, each different format requires four different connectors: a plug and receptacle {{for each of the}} A and B ends. USB cables have the plugs, and the corresponding receptacles are on the computers or electronic devices. In common practice, the A end is usually the standard format, and the B side varies over standard, mini, and micro. The mini and micro formats also provide for USB On-The-Go with a hermaphroditic AB receptacle, which accepts either an A or a B plug. On-The-Go allows USB between peers without discarding the directed topology by choosing the host at connection time; it also allows one receptacle to perform double duty in space-constrained applications.|$|R
