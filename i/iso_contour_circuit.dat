In this paper fully nonlin-ear progressive waves are generated by applying a nor-mal stress to the free surface. Precise control of the forcing allows for a systematic study of four types of deep-water breaking waves, characterized herein as weak plunging, plunging, strong plunging, and very strong plunging. The three-dimensional <b>iso</b> <b>contours</b> of vorticity ex-hibit intense streamwise vorticity shortly after the ini-tial ovular cavity of air is entrained during the primary plunging event.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of {{variable speed drives}} with induction motors and permanent magnet synchronous motors has received little attention so far in international standards. However {{the number of such}} applications is increasing rapidly and the potential energy savings are large. This paper is based on a measurement campaign of three collaborating research institutes and reports on the {{efficiency of}} motors up to 15 kW. The efficiency values are represented by means of <b>iso</b> efficiency <b>contours.</b> From these contours, the efficiency for IE 1, IE 2 and IE 3 induction motors is compared with that of a permanent magnet machine for the entire torque - speed operation region. Also the impact of flux optimization with induction motors is analyzed. The required number of measurement points to construct accurate <b>iso</b> efficiency <b>contours</b> with minimum measurement effort is also discussed. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|When {{modelling}} spatial {{real data}} in environmental context, {{the border between}} two zones israrely a sharp edge. Often, the transition from one zone to another is a gradual process. Fuzzy zones intend to model this uncertainty in zones by allowing a spatial point to belong partiallyto different zones with different membership degrees. Generating fuzzy zones {{is not easy to}} perform and can be time-consuming and difficult to interpret. It is also difficult to ensure the convexity of the generated fuzzy zones. Our idea is to generate plateau zones instead of fuzzy zones. Plateau zones are an approximation of fuzzy zones. The interest of using plateau zones lies in the following: easier spatial coherence and convexity of zones, preservation of uncertainties, level and number of plateau scan be chosen depending on the application, interpretation and easier operations between zones. Our algorithm is based on quantiles of spatial data in order to produce some <b>iso</b> <b>contours.</b> According to the desired number of plateaus, it is possible to adjust the quantile values to find next plateaus for each resulting zones. The goal of this representation is to provide the user a simplification of the spatial representation and to preserve uncertainties in order to use them in the decision process...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{contours}} {{are used}} {{as a basis for}} e. g., ship designs. The traditional approach to environmental contours is based on the well-known Rosenblatt transformation. However, due to the effects of this transformation the probabilistic properties of the resulting environmental contour can be difficult to interpret. An alternative approach to environmental contours uses Monte Carlo simulations on the joint environmental model, and thus obtain a contour without the need for the Rosenblatt transformation. This contour have well-defined probabilistic properties, but may sometimes be overly conservative in certain areas. In this paper we give a precise definition of the concept of the exceedance probability which is valid for all types of environmental contours. Moreover, we show how to estimate the exceedance probability of a given environmental contour, and use this to compare different approaches to contour constructions. The methods are illustrated by numerical examples based on real-life data. For comparison of environmental contours and finding the best contour for the given application, we have also included a third type of environmental <b>contours,</b> the <b>Iso</b> <b>contours.</b> We adjust the contours so that they get the same desired exceedance probability, which makes it possible to compare the contours graphically. We find that the best contour is the one with the lowest area as we want as little requirements for the construction of the design as possible as well as {{we want it to be}} as little conservative as possible...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{awareness}} of ecological problems forces machine manufacturers to design greener machines. This implies amongst other things {{the selection of}} the most efficient electric motor system for their specific application. On the other hand, machine building applications evolve more and more from constant speed and load characteristics to varying speed and load applications. Therefore, the motor system that is used evolves more and more from direct online (DOL) to motors fed by a variable speed drive (VSD). However, current efficiency standardization focuses on DOL applications, and can by consequence not offer assistance to the machine builder to select the most efficient motor-VSD combination for his particular varying load application. The goal {{of this paper is to}} present a methodology that allows to predict the energy consumption for a specific motor-VSD combination and a specific varying speed-load application, using the fairly new concept of <b>iso</b> efficiency <b>contours.</b> By comparing the predicted energy consumption for a number of selected combinations, the most efficient one is revealed. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Despite recent {{revisions}} and harmonization {{efforts of}} international motor efficiency standards which has {{lead to the}} revised IEC Std 60034 - 2 - 1 and the efficiency classification of IEC Std 60034 - 30, there remains a lacuna {{in the context of}} motor systems efficiency. Although IEC is preparing a “Guide for the selection and application of energyefficient motors including variable-speed applications” labeled IEC Std 60034 - 31, to date, there is no internationally accepted test protocol that allows the determination of drive system efficiency at different load points. As the first in a set of three by a joint research project of three research institutes, this paper introduces <b>iso</b> efficiency <b>contours</b> as a useful tool in this context. The concept of these contours as well as their mutual interaction with system specifications and losses are discussed. A first testing protocol for all types of motor drives is proposed. The concept is illustrated by first results of an extensive testing campaign. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} two successfully working, analog VLSI vision circuits {{that move}} beyond pixel-based early vision algorithms. One circuit, implementing the dynamic wires model, provides for dedicated {{lines of communication}} among groups of pixels that share a common property. The chip uses the dynamic wires model to compute the arclength of visual <b>contours.</b> Another <b>circuit</b> labels all points inside a given contour with one voltage and all other with another voltage. Its behavior is very robust, since small breaks in contours are automatically sealed, providing for Figure-Ground segregation in a noisy environment. Both chips are implemented using networks of resistors and switches and represent a step towards object level processing since a single voltage value encodes the property of an ensemble of pixels...|$|R
40|$|The {{high lift}} system noise of current {{transport}} aircraft is dominated by slat noise under certain operating conditions. Suitable means to reduce the noise impact {{in the vicinity of}} airports are (i) to increase the distance between the source and the observer and (ii) to reduce source noise levels. Both objectives can only be achieved by means of a multi-disciplinary aerodynamic and acoustic development since the slat {{is at the same time}} a very important element to achieve the necessary high lift performance and the dominant noise source of a {{high lift system}} 1. First attempts to reduce slat noise by means of a slat setting optimization were conducted at DLR in the mainframe of the project Leiser Flugverkehr 2. This purely acoustically driven study revealed that a slat gap reduction results in a local flow speed decrease at the slat trailing edge and thus to remarkable noise reductions of up to 10 dB, the latter of course depending on the magnitude of the slat gap reduction. The drawback of this approach was that at the same time the aerodynamic performance of the high lift system was degraded by a non-acceptable level. However, this study was the starting point of the DLR project LEISA (Low noise exposing integrated design for start and approach) that combined activities in the research areas of high lift system design and aero-acoustic design, which were carried out rather independently up to this point in time. In the project LEISA different types of high lift configurations were addressed and investigated in a 2 -dimensional approach. The first one is a long chord slat that provided a source noise reduction of about 6 dB while maintaining the aerodynamic performance of the reference slat system. The second, and more radical concept was to omit the slat and apply a droop nose system in order to reduce the aerodynamic losses as much as possible. The finally achieved source noise reduction with the droop nose system was about 8 dB while from the aerodynamic point of view about 50 % of the losses were recovered. Based on these promising results the transposition of these high lift systems to a real 3 -dimensional wing was carried out in the follow-up project SLED (Silent Leading Edge Devices). The final outcome of the project SLED can be summarized as follows. From the aerodynamic point of view the performance of the 3 -dimensional long chord slat compares very well to the reference slat system. The final droop nose design was capable to recover about 40 % of the lift loss due the omitted slat. The final acoustic results in terms of source noise levels are an overall 4 dB noise reduction for the long chord slat and about 6 dB noise reduction in case of the droop nose. The obtained aerodynamic and acoustic characteristics were finally transposed to flight in order to assess the effect on community noise which can be expressed in terms of noise iso-contour areas. Regarding the 60 dB(A) and the 65 dB(A) noise <b>iso</b> <b>contour</b> areas the achieved benefit is a reduction of up to 40 % of the respective area’s size...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} {{observation}} of a complete bandgap and collective spin wave excitation in two-dimensional magnonic crystals comprised of arrays of nanoscale antidots and nanodots, respectively. Considering that the frequencies dealt with here fall in the microwave band, these findings {{can be used for}} the development of suitable magnonic metamaterials and spin wave based signal processing. We also present the application of a numerical procedure, to compute the dispersion relations of spin waves for any high symmetry direction in the first Brillouin zone. The results obtained from this procedure has been reproduced and verified by the well established plane wave method for an antidot lattice, when magnetization dynamics at antidot boundaries is pinned. The micromagnetic simulation based method {{can also be used to}} obtain iso [...] frequency countours of spin waves. <b>Iso</b> [...] frequency <b>contours</b> are analougous of the Fermi surfaces and hence, they have the potential to radicalize our understanding of spin wave dynamics. The physical origin of bands, partial and full magnonic bandgaps has been explained by plotting the spatial distribution of spin wave energy spectral density. Although, unfettered by rigid assumptions and approximations, which afflict most analytical methods used in the study of spin wave dynamics, micromagnetic simulations tend to be computationally demanding. Thus, {{the observation of}} collective spin wave excitation in the case of nanodot arrays, which can obviate the need to perform simulations may also prove to be valuable...|$|R
40|$|This Note {{explores the}} post-Kiobel ATS cases {{and argues that}} the Fourth Circuit’s {{approach}} to considering claims that manifest a close connection to the United States as potentially entitling the plaintiff to relief under the ATS is preferable to approaches that categorically bar claims when the alleged conduct has occurred abroad. Part I describes the Kiobel decision in more depth and the subsequent ATS case law to outline the <b>contours</b> of recent <b>circuit</b> cases. Part II demonstrates how domestic personal jurisdiction and choice of law principles weigh {{in favor of a}} more expansive reading of the ATS, as adopted by the Fourth Circuit, and compares the ATS to other areas of law, including securities and antitrust law. Part III puts forward a three-part disjunctive test that courts could use to add more definition to the Fourth Circuit approach in determining if a claim touches and concerns the territory of the United States in a way that allows U. S. federal courts to consider it under the ATS: If (1) the defendant is a U. S. citizen or a U. S. corporate domiciliary; or (2) the defendant has conducted explicit planning or extensive activity in furtherance of the violation in the United States; or (3) the violation is clearly and manifestly orchestrated to target the United States, with the intent of harming the United States and its citizens, then the claim overcomes the ATS presumption against extraterritoriality...|$|R
