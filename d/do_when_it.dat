500|$|Following post-production, the {{programme}} was shelved by ITV Network Centre until 1997, when it {{was placed}} on the Easter weekend schedule as part of the network's [...] "Comedy Premieres" [...] programming strand. The broadcast, scheduled for a 9pm start on 30 March, went head-to-head with launch night of Channel 5, Britain's last terrestrial television channel, and {{the second part of the}} BBC1 drama The Missing Postman. Also broadcast on 30 March was ITV's coverage of the Brazilian Grand Prix. The race was restarted due to an accident and threw ITV's evening schedules into disarray. Broadcast of Cold Feet eventually began 40 minutes later than originally advertised and the overnight ratings reflected this; it recorded viewing figures of just 3.5million. Harries wrote it off as a failure, telling Langan that they would never get a series. Some critical success came though; writing in The Times the day after it aired, Matthew Bond called it [...] "an enjoyable one-off comedy aimed at anybody who's ever been single, married, or had children. With such catholic appeal further heightened by Helen Baxendale heading a talented cast, it showed just what ITV can <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> is trying to win awards, such as the Golden Rose of Montreux." [...] The Suns Tim Ewbank echoed Bond's reaction, expressing surprise that a [...] "fast, funny, convincing" [...] comedy had appeared on ITV, calling it [...] "a treat" [...] and [...] "sharply observed", and Baxendale and Nesbitt [...] "terrific".|$|E
2500|$|Touted as [...] "the {{most ambitious}} project on Indian television", Everests {{theatrical}} poster and trailer were released on 16 September 2014. The launch also included crew members from various departments, including costume and photography. News reports {{said that this}} was done as a [...] "token of appreciation". Nikhil Madhok, the senior Vice President of marketing and programming (STAR Plus), later said that the first thing which Everest should <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> went on-air was to break the clutter. He further said that STAR Plus had wanted to launch Everest around winter, as the audience will enjoy the telenovela more with the cold around the corner. Everest was scheduled to premiere on STAR Plus on 3 November 2014 at 10:00 pm (IST).|$|E
2500|$|In {{light of}} this loss of supply, FitzGerald went to Áras an Uachtaráin to request an {{immediate}} Dáil dissolution from the President, Patrick Hillery. When he got there, he was informed that a series of telephone calls {{had been made by}} senior opposition figures (and some independent TDs), including Fianna Fáil leader (and ex-Taoiseach) Charles Haughey, Brian Lenihan and Sylvester Barrett demanding that the President refuse the dissolution, as he was constitutionally allowed to <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was advised by a Taoiseach who has [...] "ceased to retain the support of a majority in Dáil Éireann." [...] Had Hillery done so, it would have forced FitzGerald's resignation as Taoiseach and enabled the Dáil to nominate someone else for the post--presumably Haughey. Hillery is said to have angrily rejected such pressure, regarding it as gross misconduct. He granted FitzGerald the dissolution.|$|E

On April 16, 2011, she said Obama [...] "willfully ignored {{the will of the}} American people... when you got us into a third war for fuzzy and inconsistent reasons, a third war that we cannot afford." [...] She further criticized him on April 26, demanding Obama [...] "step up and justify our Libyan involvement, or Americans are going to demand you pull out." [...] She continued, [...] "Simply put, what are we doing there? You’ve put us in a strategic no man’s land. If Gaddafi’s got to go, then tell NATO our continued participation hinges on this: We strike hard and Gaddafi will be gone. If, as you and your spokesmen suggest, we’re not to tell Libya what to <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> comes to that country’s leadership, and if you can’t explain to Americans why we’re willing to protect Libyan resources and civilians but not Syria’s, Yemen’s, Bahrain’s, Egypt’s, Israel’s, etc., then there is no justification for U.S. human and fiscal resources to be spent." ...|$|E
