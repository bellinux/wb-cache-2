40|$|A key {{challenge}} in management is making {{all parts of}} the organisation work in line with the strategies. This is not easily accomplished. As the founders of Balanced Scorecard, Kaplan and Norton promote the concept as a tool for implementation of strategy. This thesis looks at the relationship between strategy implementation and the use of Balanced Scorecard. I ask the question: Is Balanced Scorecard a solution to strategy implementation problems? Kaplan and Norton (1996 a, 2001 a) present four barriers they claim the Balanced Scorecard can overcome. Based on these barriers, I have developed five hypotheses investigating whether Balanced Scorecard enables more successful strategy implementation. The hypotheses are investigated in a case study of the Balanced <b>Scorecard</b> <b>project</b> at Telemark County Tax Office. I conclude that the use of Balanced Scorecard has improved the strategic understanding and contributed to more explicit and actionable strategies. I also conclude that the Balanced Scorecard supplies valuable strategic information. I have not managed to find support for the hypothesis that it clarifies the linkage between the goals at different organisational levels. This is most likely caused by a partial implementation of the concept in the case study organisation...|$|R

Due to characteristics of the case company's strategy, goal was also to integrate corporate social responsibility into the scorecard. Data for the theoretical part was collected from literature regarding basic characteristics of the Balanced Scorecard, its implementation and integration of corporate social responsibility. For the empirical part, data was also collected from informal unstructured interviews, internal documents and website of the case company and discussions with people involved in the Balanced <b>Scorecard</b> <b>project.</b> This research is in nature a qualitative single case study.

Tavoitteena on Balanced Scorecardin toteuttamiseen liittyvän strategisen päätöksenteon tukeminen. Teoriaosuus on toteutettu kirjallisuuden pohjalta ja empiirinen aineisto on koottu lähinnä case-yrityksen omasta Balanced Scorecard -projektista. Case-yritys on maailmanlaajuisem Stora Enso -konsernin täysin omistama täyden palvelun aaltopahviratkaisuihin erikoistunut tytäryhtiökonserni. Balanced Scorecard -projekti yrityksessä on ollu käynnissä jo parin vuoden ajan ja nykyään käytössä on myös atk-pohjainen Balanced Scorecard -ohjelmisto. Tulevaisuudessa tavoitteena on Balanced Scorecardin ja siihen liityvän ohjelmiston ottaminen käyttöön koko konsernin kaikilla organisaatiotasoilla. Tutkimuksen tuloksena mallin todetaan teorian lisäksi myös käytännössä kokoavan hajanaiset tiedot tiiviiksi ja johdonmukaiseksi kokonaisuudeksi. Balanced Scorecardin onnistuminen riippuu paljolti työntekijöiden sitoutumisesta ja johdon halusta aikaansaada muutoksia. Oikein sovellettuna Balanced Scorecard on tehokas kommunikointiväline, joka kehittyy jatkuvasti organisaation mukana. Suurimpana ongelmana tai haasteena Suomessa nähdään mallin sisäistäminen alemmilla organisaatiotasoilla.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to support strategic management concerning Balanced Scorecard implementation decisions. The theoretical section of the study is based on literature and the empirical section consists mainly of a Balanced <b>Scorecard</b> <b>project</b> of the case company. The case company is a highly specialised corrugated board producer. Stora Enso Group owns this subgroup completely. The case company has used Balanced Scorecard methodology already a couple of years nad nowadays the company uses also balanced Scorecard software. In the future the company aims to implement Balanced Scorecard and the software comprehensively in all levels of the enterprise. As a result the study concludes both in theory and in practice that the Balanced Scorecard is able to integrate the scattered information to a compact and logical package. To make the Balanced Scorecard succeed the commitment and the empowerment of the employee are very important issues. The success depends also highly on the willingness of the management to make things improve. Successful Balanced Scorecard is an efficient communication instrument which improves continuously as the company is developing, too. The biggest problem or challenge in Finland can be seen in enforcing the model to everyday use in the lower levels of the enterprise.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{have focused}} on the early {{childhood}} education teacher profession in and with the pursuit of «quality». I have chosen this topic as I experience that the focus on quality has been vast in the recent years, and that my professional knowledge is not as important as it used to be. The research question in this thesis is as follows: In what ways are the early childhood education teacher discursively inscribed in a professional dilemma between the demands from their employer and their professional knowledge? My methodological approach is genealogical analysis, inspired by Foucault. I have used Foucault as theoretical inspiration, and his concepts of discourse, power and knowledge, governmentality and truths. The data material is taken from St. meld. nr. 41 (2008 - 2009), the project mandate and different standards of/for the Prosjekt Oslobarnehagen, feature articles, newspaper articles, blog posts and other websites I have found interesting for my theses. I present the early childhood education teacher profession, criticism of the early education teaching as a profession, as well as the early childhood education teachers’ «freedom» in using different methods, which I argue is about to disappear. I explain the complexity of the concept of quality and how it is understood in public documents. Here it’s interpreted as to satisfy users’ demands and expectations, while educational quality as something other than how it’s understood in public documents. It’s giving children opportunities to develop the skills which are needed as humans, to become active participants in the society they grow up in and are a part of. New Public Management is presented, and how it affects the field of early childhood education. Prosjekt Oslobarnehagen is also thoroughly described, with its <b>scorecards,</b> <b>project</b> targets, efficacy targets and its success criterias. In chapter 4, I describe genealogy as methodology, and present my analysis questions. Genealogy is characterized as using history for discussing todays’ truisms, and not seeing the past {{as an alternative to the}} present. In this way, new stories will create alternative ways of understanding history. I also discuss my research position, with ethical reflections, especially the fact that I am being critical to Prosjekt Oslobarnehagen, and at the same time being an employee in Oslo commune. 6 In chapter 5, I present my analyses. I have analysed three different discourses: learning discourse, profession discourse and ideology discourse. I have chosen these dicourses based on the topic of my thesis. Also, by reading St. meld. nr. 41, they caught my attention, and I therefore wanted to research this further. I describe dichotomies that occur in these discourses, disqualified knowledge and power production. Master i barnehagepedagogik...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} {{a story of}} “rise and fall” of a Balanced <b>Scorecard</b> (BSC) <b>project</b> in a Sri Lankan firm. The “rise” was due {{to a series of}} attempts made by CIMA (SL) for popularising BSC practice among business leaders and local consultants, and the “fall” was due to professional rivalry between engineering managers and accounting personnel and the decline of interest {{on the part of the}} owner-manager. In relation to these two opposing phenomena, the paper shows how and why the firm first receives the BSC project as a useful management system device, and later, how and why the management tends to undermine the use of BSC. The argument advanced is that the popularisation of BSC is part of a project of accounting knowledge diffusion which comes through the broader globalisation process, but the failure in sustaining BSC is due to the upsurge of professional rivalry and the rise of alternative management fads and the owner-manager's inclination to look at financial matters, rather than a BSC, as a basis for the appropriation of surplus. The underlying public interest implication is that even though globalisation project seems to be functional and positive, it provokes contradictions and resistance when new accounting knowledge is diffused from the centre to the periphery...|$|R

In this paper we investigate these questions using newly available household survey data on access to and satisfaction with selected public services in two Indian cities, Bangalore and Jaipur. We develop a framework where actual levels of services received as well as expectations about service performance influence a household's satisfaction with service delivery. We find that satisfaction increases with improvements in the household's own service status, a finding that supports the use of scorecard initiatives. However, the results also suggest that a household's satisfaction is influenced by how service quality compares to that of its neighbors or peers and by household level characteristics such as welfare and tenure status. This implies that responses in satisfaction surveys are at least in part determined by factors that are unrelated to the service performance experienced by the household...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MPA) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2002. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The City of Cape Town {{has adopted}} the Balanced Scorecard as an {{organisational}} performance management system. Presently {{the system has}} only been implemented as a pilot project {{in the top three}} management levels of the organisation. The question then becomes one of how can individual obj ectives be aligned with the organisation's strategic objectives in this scenario. The purpose of this research is to propose a performance management model based on the Balanced Scorecard that aligns individual goals and objectives to those of the organisation. The study {{is in the form of}} a case study and specifically applies to the City of Cape Town Fire and Emergency Service. The foundation of the research is based on the creation of a sound theoretical base relating to organisational and individual performance management and the Balanced Scorecard. Once this understanding has been created the next step is to describe the development and implementation of the Balanced <b>Scorecard</b> <b>project</b> within the Cape Town context. This is the point of departure for the proposal of a Personal Scorecard performance management model. Data is to be collected via a process of semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. The information gained during the interviews created the framework within which the Personal Scorecard model was proposed. The questionnaire was used to pilot the main component of the Personal Scorecard model, namely the objective setting process. This created an opportunity to test the hypotheses made as the Personal Scorecard was developed. Once all of the components have been combined into the performance management model this research will be concluded with the presentation of recommendations relating to the knowledge gained during the model development process and alternative applications for the Personal Scorecard will be discussed. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die Stad Kaapstad het die "Balanced Scorecard" as 'n organisasie prestasie bestuursmeganisme aanvaar. Huidiglik is die meganisme net in die boonste drie bestuurs vlakke van die organisasie in gebruik geneem. Die kwessie wat geantwoord moet word is hoe individuele doelwitte met die van die organisasie versoen kan word in hierdie spesifieke scenario. Die doel van hierdie navorsing is om n prestasie bestuursmodel voor te stel wat op die "Balanced Scorecard" gebaseer is en individuele doelwitte met die van die organisasie versoen. Hierdie studie neem die vorm van 'n gevallestudie en is spesifiek gerig op die Stad Kaapstad Brand and Nooddienste. Die fondament van hierdie navorsing is gebaseer op die skepping van 'n sterk teoretiese basis met verband tot organisasie- en individuele prestasie bestuur en die "Balanced Scorecard". Die volgende stap is om die Balanced Scorecard ontwikkeling en uitvoering projek van die Stad te beskryf. Hierdie word die vertrekpunt vir die voorgestelde "Personal Scorecard" prestasie bestuursmodel. Data word versamel deur middel van semi-gestruktureerde onderhoude en vraelyste. Die inligting wat gedurende die onderhoude vesamel is het die raamwerk geskep waarin die "Personal Scorecard" voorgestel is.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an examination}} of the Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) philosophy. The dissertation approach is to analyse the BPR philosophy through segmenting it into seven critical elements. These are elements that needs to be in place to ensure BPR success. Some of the critical elements are sub-components of BPR, while some others, such as the Balanced <b>Scorecard</b> and <b>Project</b> Management, are similar management philosophies that compliment the BPR approach. The seven elements examined are: 1. The identification of Economic Value Adding opportunities of Business Process Re¬engineering. 2. Aligning Business Process Re-engineering initiatives with organisational strategy by means of the Balanced Scorecard. 3. The utilisation of Best Practices and Benchmarks during the Business Process Re-engineering effort. 4. The utilization of Best Practices and Benchmarks during the Business Process Re-engineering effort. 5. Project Management techniques applicable to Business Process Re-engineering projects. 6. Implementation Drivers that helps ensure the success of Business Process Re-engineering. 7. Capturing of Business Process Re-engineering designs in Business Architectures. By no means are these the only elements involved in BPR, but it does form an essential structure for it. None of these elements are ground breaking new research subjects, although most of them are very topical in the business world {{at the turn of the}} millennium, and some are still going through growth pains in terms of practical validation. The scope of explanation for these BPR elements is kept at a practical and understandable level, with some deep drills into detail. The main objective of this dissertation is to offer a group of elements that can be used as a whole, or as selective tools during any type of Business Process Re-engineering effort. All these elements will be referenced against experiences from the industry in the form of an actual Business Process Re-engineering project that incorporated all these elements and results from their use. The dissertation deliverable is a usable composition of elements, or a BPR toolbox that can be used by Business Process Re-engineering practitioners as an aid in their efforts.

The ability of nanotherapeutics to provide targeted drug delivery, improve drug solubility, extend drug half-life, improve a drug’s therapeutic index, and reduce a drug’s immunogenicity has resulted in the potential to revolutionize the treatment of many diseases. In this paper, we review the liposome-, nanocrystal-, virosome-, polymer therapeutic-, nanoemulsion-, and nanoparticle-based approaches to nanotherapeutics, which represent the most successful and commercialized categories within the field of nanomedicine. We discuss the regulatory pathway and initiatives endeavoring to ensure the safe and timely clinical translation of emerging nanotherapeutics and realization of health care benefits. Emerging trends are expected to confirm that this nano-concept can exert a macro-impact on patient benefits, treatment options, and the EU economy.

40|$|Agri{{cultural}} landscapes deliver multiple, {{highly valued}} goods such as cultural amenities, biodiversity conservation and climate stability. These goods are often delivered as side-effects of farmers' production decisions driven by broad-scale, supranational changes in agricultural, trade or other policies. Human well-being is thus affected in ways not {{taken into account}} in these macro-policy decisions. To avoid this policy failure, there is a growing demand for the valuation of broad-scale changes in public goods by the general public. For this purpose, context-rich valuation scenarios at this broad scale need to be developed which are empirically-based, policy-relevant and understandable by the general public. In this way, respondents are focused on actual trade-offs rather than invited to give symbolic reactions. This paper presents and discusses a valuation framework developed to fulfil these criteria. The approach is based on a typology of Macro-Regional Agri- Environmental Problems (MRAEP). Each MRAEP is defined by: (1) prevailing farming systems and agricultural landscapes; (2) current levels of public-good delivery; (3) expected direction of land-use change; and (4) expected effects of such change on public-good delivery in each macroregion. Multivariate analysis of EU-wide data on agricultural landscapes and farming-systems led to identify thirteen macro-regions in the <b>EU.</b> Current public-good <b>delivery</b> was described using public-good indicators. Only those public goods that are expected to change or could be improved by available policy options (core public goods) were used to generate choice alternatives for survey respondents. The paper ends by discussing innovative elements in the proposed approach, achievements, shortcomings and possible policy uses. JRC. J. 4 -Agriculture and Life Sciences in the Econom...|$|R

Its main {{idea is to}} add some new dimensions to previous systems mainly focussed on financial issues. Kaplan and Norton (1992) have suggested {{to add to the}} financial perspective, a customer perspective (the different value propositions), an internal processes one (how value is created), and finally a organizational learning one (role of intangible assets). However, this performance measure approach has been gradually transformed in a communication tool, in order to explain the pursued strategy to all members of the organization. Finally, after a huge number of consulting interventions, Kaplan and Norton have been able to propose a standardized structure, with the main and most usual areas of concerns of managers. Hence, they have delivered a norm of management, with its own structure, set of hypothesis and causal relationships, organizational objectives, and in particular the shareholder value creation. Two questions can then be raised, adopting such an approach. Firtsly, one can wonder if such a tool is structured as agents think and behave. Secondly, using the {{balanced scorecard}}, another question remain whether strategic alignement promises can really be reached. These questions are explored using the firm-as-text theory (Cooren and Taylor, 1997). This framework allows to conceptualize organizations as not only producing texts but also being structured by these produced texts. Our case study shows, how using a textual analysis software and lexical approach, one can reveal some misconceptions in the balanced scorecard and some other organizational issues. Overview of the textual analysis method ALCESTE in French is an acronym used for a textual analysis software which means Analysis of Coocurrent Lexemes in a Set of Textual Fragments. First applied and developed by a statistician and sociologist, Max Reinert (1993), this software has become increasingly popular in social sciences. Very briefly, the algorithm used is a cluster analysis statistical technique able to identify cooccurrent terms within short texts segments. The clustering tree also indicate how each cluster is close from one another. It also possible to tag texts, and hence test correlations between such tags and each cluster. Field Research and Case Study Our field of research is a public administration, in charge of a middle size French town. The epismogic position is an action-research from an interpretative perspective. We have helped this organization in designing and adapting its own balanced scorecard. This teamwork has been achieved with five top managers, in a context where the mayor of the town and the top director of administration were recently arrived. This approach is also known in literature as "top-down" with a system of cascading scorecards. This means that the middle management composed of twenty directors have only been solicited in a second step. Under this information system architecture, the balanced scorecards of departments are gathered in order to elaborate the central and main scorecard, useful for the top director of administration and the mayor. As can be seen, four specific have been selected. The first one is defined as "resources". The second one is about "organizational learning". The third on is classical, and centered on "internal processes". Finally, the fourth one is specific to a public administration, and retains the external, political perspective. The official strategy pursued by themayor is to transform the town in a better generous, ecological and sharing space. Research design and empirical results Each director has received an electronic document in order to feel what was his or her view and interpretation of each strategic objective. We have gathered all answers in one common file, where each answer was related to ist origin (department), and place in the scorecard (perspective, orientation, objective). These results can be interpreted in several ways. First of all, it must be mentioned that not all directors have answered and participated to this experiment. Their behavior can be explained by their reluctance to the balanced <b>scorecard</b> <b>project,</b> and their resistance to change. Another result is the number of fragments of texts clustered. The obtained rate is relatively low, not exceeding 53 %. This means that directors have in general quite different ways of thinking and interpreting similar strategic objectives. For some specific objectives, there is also almost no answer, showing that directors are unable to put words and actions behind. It is also interesting to understand, through cluster 5, that the sharing objective (*obj_shar) is in fact associated to the internal processes perspective (*per_proc). Another significant example is about the buildings and equipments optimization objective. It has been a priori classified as a process. It can be clearly shown that this objective is textually and cognitively connected to the resources perspective (cluster 4). The last result we would like to stress is the significant absence of the words "sustainable" or "sustainability". It is all the more astonishing that these concepts are {{at the core of the}} oragnizational strategy, as defined by the mayor. In fact directors do not want their local power and influence to be questioned by the Agenda 21 new imperatives. They also try to resist, and conceptualize their missions and objectives outside this transversal and collective strategic project. We have also added to our initial corpus a strategic text published by the political team and the town mayor. Using the same ALCESTE methodlogy, it can be clearly demonstrated that we have within the same organization two very different strategic projects. On one side, there is the political project, related to the town perspective in the balanced scorecard. On the other side, there is the administrative way of thinking with objectives related to other perspectives. This means that the administration still has to integrate in its strategic way of thinking the projects and the political objectives. As it has been developed in this brief abstract, a textual analysis can provide a great support in understanding the gap between the defined structure of the balanced scorecard and people organisational thinking. The absence of the word "sustainability" is a proof of a major strategic misalignement. The gap between the political discourse and the administration language can also be highlighted. In that sense, espoused theories, as shown in figure 1, are not those that are in use, as shown in our results (Argyris and Schön, 2002). Asking top executives to have a textual production can also reveal their internal strategies, will to cooperate, and lack of understanding of certain kinds of objectives. The ALCESTE statistical ratio of text's units related to clusters is also a way of measuring the group cohesion and strategic alignement. La mise en place d'un balanced scorecard dans une mairie nous fournit l'occasion de montrer les écarts de représentation entre le maire, l'équipe de direction et les responsables de services.
