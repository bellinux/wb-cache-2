40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} solving eigenvalue problems of various phenomena which are governed by the Helmholtz equation with an arbitrarily shaped outer boundary {{and a number of}} eccentric boundaries of arbitrary shape. In the analysis, the outer boundary condition is satisfied by means of the Fourier expansion collocation methed using the exact solution of the equation of motion. To satisfy the <b>inner</b> <b>boundary</b> conditions, the point restraints are added to the equation of motion, and the <b>inner</b> <b>boundary</b> conditions are satisfied by making use of a point-matching procedure. The equations for finding the eigenvalues are derived, and numerical calculations are carried out for cases of elliptical outer and a number of elliptical <b>inner</b> <b>boundaries,</b> and polygonal outer and a number of elliptical <b>inner</b> <b>boundaries...</b>|$|R

These <b>inner</b> <b>boundary</b> conditions are heuristically motivated by the dynamical trapping horizon framework and are enforced in an elliptic subsystem of the full Einstein equation. In the stationary limit they reduce to existing isolated horizon boundary conditions. A characteristic analysis completes the discussion of <b>inner</b> <b>boundary</b> conditions for the radiative modes. Comment: 4 pages, no figures, RevTeX...|$|R
40|$|The {{eigenvalue}} {{problem of}} Helmholtz's equation is of importance because various physical phenomena {{are governed by}} this equation. This paper presents a method for solving the boundary value problem governed by Helmholtz's equation haying a circular outer boundary {{and a number of}} eccentric circular <b>inner</b> <b>boundaries.</b> In this problem, it is difficult to satisfy the multiple connected boundary conditions. The present anlysis uses the point-matching approach for treating the <b>inner</b> <b>boundary</b> conditions, and presents the expression for finding the eigenvalues. Numerical calculations have been carried out for the system having one, two or four eccentrdc circular <b>inner</b> <b>boundaries...</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{developed}} countries {{the use of}} markers for land ownership has in many places been replaced by maps and land ownership registration. <b>Boundary</b> <b>markers</b> are not legal markers in Western countries and may have troublesome legal effects. However, <b>boundary</b> <b>markers</b> have legal meaning in Japan, and are generally installed across the country. Markers are still used extensively for marking international borders, which are traditionally classified into two categories: natural boundaries, correlating to topographical features such as rivers or mountain ranges, and artificial boundaries, which have no obvious relation to topography. The latter category includes borders defined by <b>boundary</b> <b>markers</b> such as stones and walls. International <b>boundary</b> <b>markers</b> are placed and can be maintained by mutual agreement of the bordering countries.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} heat {{capacity}} of a static system of self-gravitating radiations analytically {{in the context of}} general relativity. To avoid the complexity due to a conical singularity at the center, we excise the central part {{and replace it with a}} regular spherically symmetric distribution of matters of which specifications we are not interested in. We assume that the mass inside the <b>inner</b> <b>boundary</b> and the locations of the inner and the outer boundaries are given. Then, we derive a formula relating the variations of physical parameters at the outer boundary with those at the <b>inner</b> <b>boundary.</b> Because there is only one free variation at the <b>inner</b> <b>boundary,</b> the variations at the outer boundary are related, which determines the heat capacity. To get an analytic form for the heat capacity, we use the thermodynamic identity δ S_ rad = βδ M_ rad additionally, which is derived from the variational relation of the entropy formula with the restriction that the mass inside the <b>inner</b> <b>boundary</b> does not change. Even if the radius of the <b>inner</b> <b>boundary</b> of the shell goes to zero, in the presence of a central conical singularity, the heat capacity does not go to the form of the regular sphere. An interesting discovery is that another legitimate temperature can be defined at the <b>inner</b> <b>boundary</b> which is different from the asymptotic one β^- 1.

40|$|In this paper, we {{deal with}} the <b>inner</b> <b>boundary</b> of random walk range, that is, the set of those points in a random walk range which have at least one {{neighbor}} site outside the range. If L_n be the number of the <b>inner</b> <b>boundary</b> points of random walk range in the n steps, we prove _n→∞L_n/n exists with probability one. Also, we obtain some large deviation result for transient walk. We find that the expectation of the number of the <b>inner</b> <b>boundary</b> points of simple random walk on two dimensionnal square lattice is of the same order as n/(n) ^ 2.

40|$|AbstractThe inner {{membrane}} {{system of}} mitochondria {{is known to}} consist of two contiguous but distinct membranes: the <b>inner</b> <b>boundary</b> membrane, which apposes the outer membrane, and the cristal membrane, which forms tubules or lamellae in the interior. Using immunolabeling and transmission electron microscopy of bovine heart tissue, we have calculated that around 94 % of both Complex III of the respiratory chain and the ATP synthase {{are located in the}} cristal membrane, and only around 6 % of either is in the <b>inner</b> <b>boundary</b> membrane. When accounting for the topographical ratio of cristal membrane versus <b>inner</b> <b>boundary</b> membrane, we find that both complexes exist at a 2. 2 – 2. 6 -fold higher concentration in the cristal membrane. The residual protein in the <b>inner</b> <b>boundary</b> membrane may be newly assembled complexes destined for cristal membranes. Our results argue for restricted diffusion of complexes through the cristal junctions and indicate that the mitochondrial cristae comprise a regulated submitochondrial compartment specialized for ATP production...|$|R

30|$|Both {{our model}} and the model used by Kallio and Janhunen (2001) have an {{absorbing}} boundary condition for the <b>inner</b> <b>boundary.</b> Thus, the incoming protons are not reflected, but absorbed. In the paper by Kallio and Janhunen (2001), a hybrid code is used above the exobase, and a Monte Carlo simulation is used below. This means that in their model, the protons are not artificially cut away from the whole simulation, but are treated as particles colliding with atmospheric neutrals. These collisions backscatter the ions (Kallio and Barabash, 2001). The ions may hit the <b>inner</b> <b>boundary</b> a few times more, instead of being immediately removed after one hit on the <b>inner</b> <b>boundary.</b> We cannot completely exclude {{the effect of the}} particle removal introduced by our <b>inner</b> <b>boundary</b> (see Fig. 1) on the precipitation pattern at altitudes lower than the outer sphere. However, this removal should be in proportion to the number of particle hits onto the exobase. In the case where the ions are taken away when hitting the <b>inner</b> <b>boundary,</b> one would expect that if the number of incoming particles to the exobase is larger on the dayside than elsewhere, the <b>inner</b> <b>boundary</b> will remove the hits in the same proportion all over the planet. On the other hand, if ion-neutral collisions are implemented at the exobase, one would also expect that if the incoming proton flux is largest on dayside, the proton flux at the exobase will be still largest in that region, after particle backscattering.|$|R

30|$|Since for {{any given}} φ(t), problem (1.1 a)-(1.3) is a {{diffraction}} problem, we must first investigate the corresponding diffraction problem.

30|$|Observed dynamo {{properties}} that require boundary heterogeneity may alternatively {{be explained by}} lateral anomalies at the <b>inner</b> core <b>boundary.</b> Olson and Deguen (2012) showed that the dipole eccentricity in archeomagnetic field models can be reproduced by dynamo simulations with heterogeneous Y_ 1 ^ 1 <b>inner</b> <b>boundary</b> bouyancy flux pattern, corresponding to the east-west seismic anomalies at the upper inner core (Tanaka and Hamaguchi 1997). Aubert et al. (2013) showed that the localization of the westward drift of the geomagnetic field at the Atlantic hemisphere {{is controlled by the}} same heterogeneous <b>inner</b> <b>boundary</b> buoyancy flux. In these studies, the <b>inner</b> <b>boundary</b> heterogeneity amplitude was set to be significantly larger than that of the outer boundary, therefore the role of the CMB heterogeneity becomes secondary. It would be interesting to explore dynamo models with comparable amplitude heterogeneities on both boundaries to investigate competing effects.|$|R
