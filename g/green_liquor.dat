40|$|There {{are a few}} {{possible}} ways {{to produce}} ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass, for instance, thermochemical and acid hydrolysis. However, enzymatic hydrolysis of carbohydrates is considered the greenest process for saccharification, followed by sugar fermentation into ethanol. The main challenge of the enzymatic saccharification process is that cellulose is not exposed to the enzyme action in the lignin matrix. The cellulose molecules are arranged in semi-crystalline nanofibrils immersed in lignin matrix with hemicelluloses (polyoses) and extractives between them acting as coupling agents. These nanofibrils are placed together to form helical microfibrils inside the cell wall. Thus, a pre-treatment is necessary {{to make room for}} the enzymes to reach the cellulose fibril surfaces in order for the whole process to become economically feasible. There are many pre-treatments proposed in specialized literature, but their efficiencies are dependent on the biomass composition [1 - 4]. Moreover, these treatments have to address some constraints such as the recyclability of the chemicals used, low consumption of energy, and sustainability concerns. We devised a future possibility of a cellulose pulp mill to be transformed into a biorefinary, where besides cellulose pulp, ethanol could also be produced.

Solidification/stabilisation of sulphide ore mine tailings is {{one type of}} potential application of <b>green</b> <b>liquor</b> dregs which is considered in this work. The project aimed at assessing the efficiency of <b>green</b> <b>liquor</b> dregs associated with other pulping wastes (fly ash, bark sludge) in decreasing the permeability and release of metal contaminants in copper mine tailings from an abandoned mine site. The possibility to use these pulping wastes as a hydraulic barrier to cover tailings or traditional landfills was also considered. To achieve this objective, 2 types of permeability tests were performed, as well as an adapted Column Leaching test and a modified Batch Leaching in oxidising conditions. Tailings alone, different combinations of pulping wastes, and tailings treated with these combinations of pulping wastes were tested. Addition of pulping wastes to tailings proved efficient in immobilising copper, in particular when one type of <b>green</b> <b>liquor</b> dregs was added to tailings in the proportion of 10 %. Copper release was reduced at least 4 times by all the admixtures. Permeability of tailings was decreased to various extents with the addition of different proportions of pulping wastes.

Hydraulic conductivities of pulping wastes were not as low as to guarantee their efficiency as a hydraulic barrier. It was suggested that moistening the materials may improve their impermeability.

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 Douglas-fir {{wood chips}} from Oregon were pulped with kraft <b>green</b> <b>liquor</b> to produce {{semi-chemical}} pulps with properties {{suitable for the}} manufacture of corrugating medium. The effects of five cooking variables were studied, chemical charge, chip size, bark content of chips, pulping temperature, and liquor sulfidity.

Pulping properties studied were pulp yield, total solids of the waste liquor, pH of the waste liquor, the hypo number test of the pulp, and such pulp strength properties as Concora crush strength, tensile, burst, tear, and stiffness. Chemical charge {{is the most important}} single variable affecting pulp yield, tensile strength, and Concora strength, whereas the sulfidity does not affect the pulp yield but does affect the tensile and Concora strengths. Cooking temperature, bark content, and chip size have less significant effects on pulp yields and pulp strength properties. <b>Green</b> <b>liquor</b> pulps have distinctly darker colors than neutral sulfite pulps from the same wood species, and the former pulp forms denser sheets than the latter.

Although split white liquor sulfidity and other high sulfidity procedures have the promise of addressing several of the latter important economic needs of pulp mills, they require considerable engineering/capital retrofits, redesigned production methods, and thus add to overall mill expenditures. <b>Green</b> <b>liquor</b> use, however, possesses the required high sulfidity to obtain in general the benefits attributable to higher sulfidity cooking, without the required capital constraints for implementation.

40|$|Sweden {{has a large}} mining {{industry}} compared {{to the rest of}} Europe that results in large amounts of mine waste that must be taken care of in an environmentally and economically sustainable way. The mine waste consist of either of waste rock, that is unmineralized/uneconomic that have to be mined for practical reasons to get access to the ore, or tailings, which is a waste product from the enrichment process. The most common oretype to be mined is metal sulfide ore, out of 13 active metal ore mines in the end of 2009 sulfide ore was mined in 11 mines. The sulfide ore often have a metal content of a few percent that results in large amounts of tailings. The tailings are stored in large deposits at the mine site and when the tailings are exposed to oxygen in the air the sulfides in the tailings oxidize. The oxidation of sulfide minerals creates acid mine drainage with high metal content and is considered to be harmful to health and environment. In combination with Sweden’s more and more strict environmental legislation the demands have increased on the {{mining industry}} to find good and sustainable solutions to prevent oxidation of sulfide rich tailings. At the same time the heavy industry has become affected by increased costs for landfilling of non-recyclable wastes and has therefore started to search for new alternatives for reusing the waste instead of landfilling it. Two types of wastes that have become interesting to use as cover materials for landfills and tailing deposits are <b>green</b> <b>liquor</b> dregs and fly ashes. To evaluate how <b>green</b> <b>liquor</b> dregs and fly ash ages when used as cover materials in landfills the Rönnskär processing plant and smelter placed two covers on their tailings deposits as pilot study in 2006. One of the covers consisted of <b>green</b> <b>liquor</b> dregs from Smurfit Kappa Kraftliner AB and the other cover consisted of fly ashes from Skellefteå Kraft AB. This study is an evaluation of the two covers after being in use for 5 years. Due to a high water saturation degree both of the covers can be considered to decrease oxygen diffusion to the tailings via air. This has resulted in an oxygen level in the covers to be low according to the mobility of the elements interpreted from the chemical analysis. The covers also have a chemical impact on the tailings where the most noticeable change is the pH. The pH in the tailings under the covers have increased from ca pH 2 to ca pH 3 - 6 compared to the tailings without cover. The covers also {{have a negative impact on}} the tailings where the highest impact is that Zn is leaching from the covers and accumulated in the tailings below.

To overcome {{the disadvantage of}} high cost by conventional treatments, the use of paper mill wastes was evaluated as an alkaline additive to treat AMD at sites within the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB) through batch experiments in the laboratory. Paper wastes include three by-products from kraft pulping in a nearby mill: <b>Green</b> <b>liquor</b> dregs, slacker grits, and lime mud. When paper mill wastes interacted with AMD, the initial pH increased up to circumneutral values and enhanced greatly the metal removal, reaching average ratios of up to 100 % for Al, 98 % for Fe, and 66 % for Zn (major elements) and 100 % for As, Cr, and Cu, 84 % for Cd, and 75 % for Ni (minor elements). After reaction, gypsum and poorly crystalline Fe-Al oxy-hydroxides and oxy-hydroxysulfates were the main precipitates identified by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Trace metal uptake is mainly attributed to co-precipitation and/or adsorption onto the newly formed Fe-Al precipitates. Geochemical modeling of solutions using the PHREEQC code predicted supersaturation of the observed phases. The experimental results were optimized with the PHREEQC code and combined with the annual production of each waste to quantify the extent of a possible treatment at field-scale. According to our estimations, the system proposed is able to treat effectively an annual total volume of 11. 6 hm 3, which is equivalent to a mean discharge of 368 L/s. <b>Green</b> <b>liquor</b> dregs alone {{would be able to}} treat 86 % of the total volume. This result demonstrates the possibility of using alkaline paper mill wastes for treatment and restoration of worldwide natural resources extremely contaminated by AMD such as the IPB.
