40|$|Spatially varying {{strained}} graphene {{can acquire}} interesting electronic properties {{because of the}} strain-induced valley-dependent gauge (pseudomagnetic) fields 1, 2. Here we report the realization of strained graphene regions located close to the step edges of Cu(111), obtained by using thermal strain engineering 3, 4. We study these strained structures with sub-nanometre-resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy and identify their spatially modulated Dirac points, demonstrating the effect of overlap of Cu and graphene wave functions on the charge transfer between them 5. By applying a magnetic field of 8 Tesla, electron confinement, as revealed by regularly spaced sharp resonances 6, 7, is observed in the strained graphene. In some regions of the strained graphene, repetitive pairs of resonance peaks appear in the tunnelling spectra.

40|$|The newly {{identified}} type III interferon (IFN-λ) has antiviral activity {{against a}} broad spectrum of viruses. We thus examined whether IFN-λ has the ability to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) infection of blood monocyte-derived macrophages that expressed IFN-λ receptors. Both IFN-λ 1 and IFN-λ 2, when added to macrophage cultures, inhibited HIV- 1 infection and replication. This IFN-λ-mediated anti-HIV- 1 activity is broad, as IFN-λ could inhibit infection by both laboratory-adapted and clinical strains of HIV- 1. Investigations of the mechanism(s) responsible for the IFN-λ action showed that although IFN-λ had little effect on HIV- 1 entry coreceptor CCR 5 expression, IFN-λ induced the expression of CC chemokines, the ligands for CCR 5. In addition, IFN-λ upregulated intracellular expression of type I IFNs and APOBEC 3 G/ 3 F, the newly identified anti-HIV- 1 cellular factors. These data provide <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> <b>compelling</b> evidence that IFN-λ, through both extracellular and intracellular antiviral mechanisms, inhibits HIV- 1 replication in macrophages. These findings indicate that IFN-λ may have therapeutic value in the treatment of HIV- 1 infection...|$|R
40|$|The ≈ 3, 450 -million-year-old Strelley Pool Formation in Western Australia {{contains}} a reef-like assembly of laminated sedimentary accretion structures (stromatolites) that have macroscale characteristics suggestive of biological influence. However, direct microscale evidence of biology—namely, organic microbial remains or biosedimentary fabrics—has to date eluded discovery in the extensively-recrystallized rocks. Recently-identified outcrops with relatively good textural preservation record microscale evidence of primary sedimentary processes, including some that indicate probable microbial mat formation.

Thus, the most <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> <b>compelling</b> signatures {{of life in the}} Strelley Pool Formation are those observed at the microscopic scale.

40|$|The {{thermodynamics}} of a {{monoclonal antibody}} (mAb) -peptide interaction have {{been characterized by}} isothermal titration microcalorimetry. GCC:B 10 mAb, generated against human guanylyl cyclase C, a membrane-associated receptor and a potential marker for metastatic colon cancer, recognizes the cognate peptide epitope HIPPENIFPLE and its two contiguous mimotopes, HIPPEN and ENIFPLE, specifically and reversibly. The exothermic binding reactions between 6. 4 and 42 degreeC are driven by dominant favorable enthalpic contributions between 20 and 42 degreeC, with a large negative heat capacity (DELTACp) of - 421 +- 27 cal mol- 1 K- 1. The unfavorable negative value of entropy (DELTASb 0) at 25 degreeC, an unusual feature among protein-protein interactions, becomes a positive one below an inversion temperature of 20. 5 degreeC. Enthalpy-entropy compensation due to solvent reorganization accounts for an essentially unchanged free energy of interaction (DELTADELTAGb 0 simeq 0). The role of water molecules in the recognitionprocess was tested by coupling an osmotic stress technique with isothermal titration microcalorimetry. The results provide <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> <b>compelling</b> evidence that GCC:B 10 mAb recognizes the peptides HIPPENIFPLE, HIPPEN, and ENIFPLE differentially, with a concomitant release of variable and non-additive numbers of water molecules (15, 7, and 3, respectively) from {{the vicinity of the}} binding site...|$|R
40|$|Stargardt-like macular {{dystrophy}} (STGD 3) is a dominantly inherited juvenile {{macular degeneration}} that eventually leads to loss of vision. Three independent mutations causing STGD 3 {{have been identified}} in exon six of a gene named Elongation of very long chain fatty acids 4 (ELOVL 4). The ELOVL 4 protein was predicted to be involved in fatty acid elongation, although evidence for this and the specific step(s) it may catalyze have remained elusive. Here, using a gain-of-function approach, we provide <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> <b>compelling</b> evidence that ELOVL 4 is required for the synthesis of C 28 and C 30 saturated fatty acids (VLC-FA) and of C 28 -C 38 very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLC-PUFA), the latter being uniquely expressed in retina, sperm, and brain. Rat neonatal cardiomyocytes and a human retinal epithelium cell line (ARPE- 19) were transduced with recombinant adenovirus type 5 carrying mouse Elovl 4 and supplemented with 24 : 0, 20 : 5 n 3, or 22 : 5 n 3. The 24 : 0 was elongated to 28 : 0 and 30 : 0; 20 : 5 n 3 and 22 : 5 n 3 were elongated to a series of C 28 -C 38 PUFA.

We demonstrate that this region, central {{to the development of}} modern civilisation, was substantially affected throughout the Holocene by a distinct cycle of cooling events on the order of 2 o C. In the best-preserved cases the onset of these events appears particularly abrupt, within less than a century. The cooling events typically lasted several centuries, <b>and</b> there are <b>compelling</b> <b>indications</b> that they were associated with increased aridity in the Levantine/NE African sector (Rossignol-Strick, 1995; 1998; Alley et al., 1997; Hassan, 1986; 1996; 1997 a,b; McKim Malville et al., 1998).

40|$|Abstract The {{pathogenesis}} of Alzheimer's {{disease is}} highly complex. While several pathologies characterize this disease, amyloid plaques, {{composed of the}} β-amyloid peptide are hallmark neuropathological lesions in Alzheimer's disease brain. Indeed, a wealth of evidence suggests that β-amyloid {{is central to the}} pathophysiology of AD and is likely to play an early role in this intractable neurodegenerative disorder. The BACE 1 enzyme is essential for the generation of β-amyloid. BACE 1 knockout mice do not produce β-amyloid and are free from Alzheimer's associated pathologies including neuronal loss and certain memory deficits. The fact that BACE 1 initiates the formation of β-amyloid, and the observation that BACE 1 levels are elevated in this disease provide <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> <b>compelling</b> reasons to develop therapies directed at BACE 1 inhibition thus reducing β-amyloid and its associated toxicities. However, new data indicates that complete abolishment of BACE 1 may be associated with specific behavioral and physiological alterations. Recently a number of non-APP BACE 1 substrates have been identified. It is plausible that failure to process certain BACE 1 substrates may underlie some of the reported abnormalities in the BACE 1 -deficient mice. Here we review BACE 1 biology, covering aspects ranging from the initial identification and characterization of this enzyme to recent data detailing the apparent dysregulation of BACE 1 in Alzheimer's disease. We pay special attention to the putative function of BACE 1 during healthy conditions and discuss in detail the relationship that exists between key risk factors for AD, such as vascular disease (and downstream cellular consequences), and the pathogenic alterations in BACE 1 that are observed in the diseased state. </p...|$|R

This thesis describes {{experimental studies of}} the spin transfer torque induced switching in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) {{for the application of}} spin transfer torque random access memory (STT-RAM). In the material development; the in-plane MTJ was optimized {{in order to meet the}} requirement of STT-RAM application. Perpendicular magnetocrystalline anisotropy was obtained in the L 10 phase FePd designed for the top MTJ electrode and bottom MTJ electrode. Moreover, full CoFeB MTJ with interface perpendicular anisotropy was developed. An average of 48 % reduction in the intrinsic critical current density was found by increasing the interface perpendicular anisotropy. Sub 200 ps ultrafast STT induced switching was also demonstrated in those CoFeB MTJs where the out-of-plane demagnetizing field was partially canceled by the interface perpendicular anisotropy. High J/Jc 0 ratio and magnetization nucleation at the edge of free layer are possibly the two major factors that contribute to the ultrafast spin transfer torque switching. In the spin transfer torque (STT) induced switching study; systematic characterization of the probabilistic STT induced switching process was done. It includes the three STT induced switching modes, the switching energy, the switching speed and the high precision switching probability density function (PDF). The temperature dependent MTJ properties and STT switching distribution was also studied. Those results provided key parameters for the STT-RAM design. In the end, <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> <b>compelling</b> experimental evidence was provided to show the large dynamic energy barrier reduction induced by high frequency spin current excitations. The concept of magnetization logarithmic susceptibility was proposed to describe this dynamic effect.

Results of two similar surveys conducted in 2011 - 2012 (452 respondents) and 2013 - 2014 (273 respondents) were compared to estimate preferences of Moscow primary care physicians regarding initial antihypertensive agents for therapy of uncomplicated mild to moderate HT taking into consideration an influence of regulatory requirement to prescribe medicinal products by international nonproprietary name (INN) since July 2012. All participants were proposed to write down their preferred antihypertensive agents for initial mono- or combined therapy of mild to moderate HT with moderate cardiovascular risk <b>and</b> absence of <b>compelling</b> <b>indications.</b> Results. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) remained the leading class of antihypertensive agents, though their popularity slightly but significantly declined from 44. 4 % in 2011 - 12 to 37. 2 % in 2013 - 14 (р< 0. 05). Angiotensin receptor blockers partially displaced the leaders and increased their popularity from 11. 3 % in 2011 - 12 to 18. 0 % in 2013 - 14 (р< 0. 01). ACEI/diuretic combination remained on the 3 rd position (16. 4 % and 15. 3 % respectively). Beta-blockers and diuretics as monotherapy shared 4 th and 5 th places in this rating. Calcium channel blockers popularity among Moscow prescribers remained unchanged and poor – 2. 1 %. The most popular medicine by trade name was Noliprel, perindopril/indapamide fixed combination, – 14. 0 % and 13. 7 % of respondents in 2011 - 12 and 2013 - 14, respectively.

MethodsWe systematically reviewed the controlled studies on primary stenting for atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. Studies were included if they compared the outcome of stenting with other treatments, or the outcome associated with different stent characteristics or stenting methods. ResultsStenting is preferred over angioplasty alone and over surgery when revascularization is indicated for ostial ARAS, except in cases of coexistent aortic disease indicating surgery.

FCC, 395 U.S. 367 at 381, the Court stated that “the construction of a statute by those charged with its execution should be followed unless there are <b>compelling</b> <b>indications</b> that it is wrong...” [...] The Court found no indication that HEW was wrong to approve state programs.|$|R

It remains unclear whether this increased risk was driven by the type of β-blocker. We sought to compare the efficacy of atenolol vs nonatenolol β-blockers in clinical trials enrolling young (< 60 years) and older patients with hypertension. MethodsThe Cochrane and MEDLINE databases were searched (January 2006 -May 2013) for randomized trials evaluating stroke, myocardial infarction, death, or composite cardiovascular end points. Twenty-one hypertension trials with data on 145, 811 participants were identified: 15 used atenolol, 7 were placebo-controlled trials, and 14 were active comparator trials. There were no trials of newer generation β-blockers identified. ResultsAmong the elderly, atenolol was associated with an increased risk of stroke (relative risk [RR], 1. 17; 95 % confidence interval [CI],  1. 05 - 1. 30) compared with other antihypertensive agents. The risk of stroke for nonatenolol β-blockers compared with other agents (RR,  1. 22; 95 % CI, 0. 99 - 1. 50) did not reach statistical significance in the elderly. In the young, atenolol was associated with reduced risk of stroke compared with other agents (RR, 0. 78; 95 % CI, 0. 64 - 0. 95), whereas nonatenolol β-blockers were associated with a lower risk of composite cardiac events (RR, 0. 86; 95 % CI, 0. 75 - 0. 996) compared with placebo, with no significant difference in events compared with active controls. ConclusionsIn the young, both atenolol and nonatenolol β-blockers are effective in reducing cardiovascular end points for hypertension without <b>compelling</b> <b>indications.</b> Atenolol is associated with increased stroke in the elderly but whether this extends to nonatenolol β-blockers remains uncertain...|$|R

40|$|QCD finite energy sum rules, {{together}} with the latest updated ALEPH data on hadronic decays of the tau-lepton are used {{in order to determine}} the vacuum condensates of dimension d = 2 and d = 4. These data are also used to check the validity of the Weinberg sum rules, and to determine the chiral condensates of dimension d = 6 and d = 8, as well as the chiral correlator at zero momentum, proportional to the counter term of the O p 4 O(p^ 4) Lagrangian of chiral perturbation theory, L ¯ 10 L_ 10. Suitable (pinched) integration kernels are introduced in the sum rules in order to suppress potential quark-hadron duality violations.
