5|$|Scaly-tailed {{squirrels}} {{and flying}} squirrels, although not closely related, can both glide {{from tree to}} tree using parachute-like membranes that stretch from the fore to the hind limbs. The agouti is fleet-footed and antelope-like, being digitigrade and having hoof-like nails. The majority of rodents have tails, which can be of many shapes and sizes. Some tails are prehensile, as in the Eurasian <b>harvest</b> <b>mouse,</b> and the fur on the tails can vary from bushy to completely bald. The tail is sometimes used for communication, as when beavers slap their tails on the water surface or house mice rattle their tails to indicate alarm. Some species have vestigial tails or no tails at all. In some species, the tail is capable of regeneration if a part is broken off.|$|E

The emphasis of this chapter is on small mammals common to both areas, i. e. endangered salt marsh <b>harvest</b> <b>mice</b> and several rare shrews. Both China Camp and Rush Ranch contain significant stretches of intact marsh–upland ecotone that provide refuge for small mammals during periods of high water.

40|$|<b>Harvest</b> <b>mice</b> of {{the genus}} Reithrodontomys first were {{reported}} from Nicaragua by Oldfield Thomas (1907), who originally described Reithrodontomys sumichrasti modestus based on a single specimen from Jinotega. J. A. Allen (1908, 1910) recorded additional specimens of R. s. modestus, which still was the only species known from the country when A. H. Howell (1914) revised the genus Reithrodontomys. In his thorough review of Latin American <b>harvest</b> <b>mice,</b> Hooper (1952) added a second species, Reithrodontomys mexicanus lucifrons, to the Nicaraguan fauna, and Englert (1959) and Anderson and Jones (1960) recorded three additional kinds. The present report treats six species, including one that is described as new; one new subspecific name also is proposed. This paper is an outgrowth of investigations in Nicaragua principally by field parties from the Museum of Natural History at the University of Kansas. The first of these, consisting of J. R. Alcorn and his family, obtained mammals {{in the winter and}} spring of 1956 {{under the aegis of the}} Kansas University Endowment Association. Their collections are particularly rich in rodent material and include <b>harvest</b> <b>mice</b> reported originally by Englert, and Anderson and Jones. Later, between February of 1964 and the spring of 1968, other field parties from Kansas, supported by a contract (DA- 49 - 193 -MD- 221 5) from the U. S. Army Medical Research and Development Command, collected mammals and their ectoparasites in Nicaragua and obtained additional specimens. Furthermore, we have been privileged to examine material housed in the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) and the U. S. National Museum (USNM), bringing to a total of 124 the number of <b>harvest</b> <b>mice</b> available to us for study. Specimens listed as examined are in the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History unless otherwise noted; because undue crowding of symbols would have resulted, localities set in italics are not plotted on the distribution maps...|$|R

40|$|We {{compared}} the initial effects of four forest regeneration treatments (single-tree selection, group selection, shelterwood, and clearcut), and unharvested controls (mature, second-growth forest) on relative abundance of small mammals and smallmammal habitat throughout the Ouachita Mountains of western Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma. We compared small-mammal capture rates in 20 forest stands (4 replicates of 5 treatments) for 2 {{years prior to}} harvest treatments, and 1. 5, 3. 5, and 5. 5 years after treatment. We also examined relationships among small mammals, treatments, and habitat conditions. Before harvest, all stands where characterized by high basal areas (BA), little understory vegetation, and low small-mammal capture rates. Compared with pre-harvest numbers, {{the number of individuals}} captured increased nearly five-fold in treated stands 1. 5 years after harvest. After harvest, capture rates for all taxa combined were significantly greater in harvested stands (regardless of treatment) than in unharvested controls. Fulvous <b>harvest</b> <b>mice</b> (Reithrodontomys fulvescens) capture rates were greatest in clearcuts. Fulvous <b>harvest</b> <b>mice,</b> cotton rats (Sigmondon hispidus), and pine voles (Microtus pinetorum) were associated with abundant herbaceous vegetation in the understory and low BA. Eastern woodrats (NeotomaJEoridana), golden mice (Ochrotomys nuttalli), and Peromyscus spp. were associated with moderate to dense woody vegetation in the understory and intermediate BA levels. No taxon of terrestrial small mammal was captured exclusively in unharvested stands; most taxa we captured appear to be either disturbance-adapted or tolerant to disturbances from timber harvest...|$|R

Butterflies would settle quietly on the hot stones beside me as if to match their raiment against mine.

A solemn grasshopper would occasionally straddle across my palm, and with patience I made quite {{an old friend of}} a <b>harvest</b> <b>mouse.</b> They weigh only two to the half-penny. This sharp-nosed furry morsel would creep swiftly along to share my crumbs and snuggle itself to sleep in my lap. By-and-by, I suppose, it took to itself a wife; I saw it no more. Bees would rest there, the panniers of their thighs laden with pollen: and now and then a wasp, his jaws full of wood or meat.

If the killing at home is not sufficient to satisfy a man, he can transport himself to the Dark Continent and revel in the slaughter of all the greatest and noblest forms of life on the globe. There is no crime and no punishment and no comfort to those who are looking on, except some on exceedingly rare occasion when we receive a thrill of joy at the lamentable tidings of the violent death of some noble young gentleman beloved of everybody and a big-game hunter, who was elephant-shooting, when one of the great brutes, stung to madness by his wounds, turned, even when dying, on his persecutor and trampled him to death.|$|E
6000|$|While {{walking across}} the park they conversed once more about their {{vanished}} friends. Eden had no news to tell, but still cherished hopes {{of being able to}} discover their retreat. When they were once inside the Gardens, Fan soon forgot everything except the pleasure of the moment. She could not have had a better guide than her companion, for beside a fair knowledge of wild animal life, he had the pleasant faculty of seeing things in a humorous light. And above everything, he knew his way about, and could show her many little mysterious things, hidden away behind jealously-guarded doors, of which he had the keys, and pretty bird performances and amusing mammalian comedies, all of which are missed by the casual visitor. The laughing jackasses laughed their loudest, almost frightening her with their weird cachinnatory chorus; and the laughing hyæna screamed his sepulchral ha-ha-ha's so that he was heard all the way to Primrose Hill. Pelicans, penguins, darters and seals captured and swallowed scores of swift slippery fishes for her pleasure. She was taken to visit the [...] "baby" [...] in its private apartment, and saw him at close quarters, not without fear and shrinking, for the baby was as big as a house--the leviathan of the ancients, as some think. Into its vast open mouth she dropped a bun, which was like giving a grain of rice to a hungry human giant. Then she was made to take a large armful of green clover and thrust it into the same yawning red cavern; and having done so she started quickly back for fear of being swallowed alive along with the grass. Mr. Eden spent a small fortune on buns, nuts, and bon-bons for the animals, and she fed everything, from the biggest elephant and the most tree-like giraffe to the smallest <b>harvest</b> <b>mouse.</b> But it was most curious with an eagle they looked at.|$|E
