50|$|After {{partition}} of India, many skilled weavers of Dhaka came {{and settled in}} West Bengal around Shantipur in Nadia district and Ambika Kalna of Bardhaman district, both traditionally renowned centres for hand-woven fabrics.

40|$|In {{studying}} the past, archaeologists examine change and continuity over time, but physical processes {{that affect the}} preservation of material remains make fine sequencing, {{at the level of}} decades, difficult or impossible. Cultural anthropologists and others who study present-day material culture frequently conduct short-term fieldwork, which makes it difficult or impossible to reliably study transformations over time. One solution to this problem is long-term ethnographic fieldwork, combining synchronic and diachronic data collection, to study processes of change and continuity in the production of individual weavers and extended families over generations, in communities and regions. This paper is a preliminary analysis of three decades (1976 - 2006) of <b>belt</b> <b>weaving</b> on Taquile Island, in Lake Titicaca, Peru, based on two years of anthropological ethnographic fieldwork during a 30 -year period. Taquile {{is one of the few}} communities in highland Peru where indigenous, Quechua-speaking people still produce and wear handwoven textiles on a daily basis (fig. 1). (Quechua is the Inca language). Taquile has experienced enormous changes recently, resulting from the commercialization of their textiles starting in 1968, and the development of tourism starting in 1976. Here, I provide a brief examination of some aspects of the textile style of this community by examining several <b>belts</b> <b>woven</b> by three generations of women in one extended family; I also document a recent modification to the traditional loom used to <b>weave</b> these <b>belts.</b> The discussion of change in one area of material culture (textiles), one type of textile (<b>belts),</b> <b>woven</b> by one extended family, in one community (Taquile), shows that in the short period of 30 years a community style changed in the areas of technology (materials, loom type, weave structures), uses (personal and family use; sale), and meanings (internal vs. external; use and exchange vs. commodification or commercialization). Yet, there was continuity in all of these areas, such that the overwhelming majority of <b>belts</b> <b>woven</b> in the 21 st century can be relatively easily identified, even by the textile-illiterate, as coming from this community. Such analysis illustrates why longterm ethnographic research is essential to understand the messages that Andean weavers communicate...|$|R

2500|$|Throughout the Middle Ages, {{the common}} {{clothing}} amongst the Gaelic Irish {{consisted of a}} brat (a woollen semi circular cloak) worn over a léine (a loose-fitting, long-sleeved tunic made of linen). For men the léine reached to their ankles but was hitched up {{by means of a}} crios (pronounced 'kriss') which was a type of <b>woven</b> <b>belt.</b> The léine was hitched up to knee level. (Gaelicattire.com) Women wore the léine at full length. Men sometimes wore tight-fitting trews (Gaelic triúbhas) but otherwise went bare-legged. The brat was simply thrown over both shoulders or sometimes over only one. Occasionally the brat was fastened with a dealg (brooch), with men usually wearing the dealg at their shoulders and women at their chests. The ionar (a short, tight-fitting jacket) became popular later on. In Topographia Hibernica, written during the 1180s, Gerald de Barri wrote that the Irish commonly wore hoods at that time (perhaps forming part of the brat), while Edmund Spenser wrote in the 1580s that the brat was (in general) their main item of clothing. Gaelic clothing {{does not appear to have}} been influenced by outside styles.|$|R
