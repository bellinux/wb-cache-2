5|$|An inter-municipal railway {{committee}} {{was established in}} 1941. Led by Sigval Bergesen, it considered the possibility of extending the Ålgård Line towards Hunnedalen via Setesdalsheiene to Lunde in Telemark. The line would be built with a higher standard than the Sørlandet Line and have a shorter route, allowing travel time from Stavanger to Oslo to be reduced to four to <b>five</b> <b>hours.</b> <b>A</b> detailed plan was made for the extension from Ålgård to the county border with Telemark. To consider the proposal, parliament established a committee in 1949 {{to look at the}} various proposals. After considering the impact and value of the various railways that had been proposed in the 1940s, it recommended not building the Inner Trunk Line, as the expansion had been christened.|$|E

Travel time to Sandnessjøen, where the closest hospital was located, took <b>five</b> <b>hours.</b> <b>A</b> committee, led by Erik Himle and later Preben Munthe, was appointed in 1962 to consider additional airports in Norway.

Music producer Jazze Pha played the skating rink's DJ; Rico Wade, a part of the Atlanta-based production team Organized Noize, who also frequented Jellybeans in the early '90s, made an appearance as well. R singer Monica, a protégé of producer Austin's, also plays a Waffle House waitress in the film.

500|$|Imprisoned with 25 fellow conspirators, Castro renamed [...] "The Movement" [...] the [...] "26th of July Movement" [...] (MR-26-7) {{in memory}} of the Moncada attack's date. Forming a school for prisoners, the Abel Santamaría Ideological Academy, Castro {{organized}} <b>five</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> day of teaching in ancient and modern history, philosophy and English. He read widely, enjoying the works of Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, and Martí but also reading books by Freud, Kant, Shakespeare, Munthe, Maugham and Dostoyevsky, analyzing them within a Marxist framework. He began reading about Roosevelt's New Deal, believing that something similar should be enacted in Cuba. Corresponding with supporters outside of prison, he maintained control over the Movement and organized the publication of History Will Absolve Me, with an initial print run of 27,500 copies. Initially permitted a relatively high amount of freedom within the prison compared to other inmates, he was locked up in solitary confinement after his comrades sang anti-Batista songs on a visit by the President in February 1954. Meanwhile, Castro's wife Mirta gained employment in the Ministry of the Interior, having been encouraged to do so by her brother, a friend and ally of Batista's. This was kept a secret from Castro, who found out through a radio announcement. Appalled, he raged that he would rather die [...] "a thousand times" [...] than [...] "suffer impotently from such an insult". Both Fidel and Mirta initiated divorce proceedings, with Mirta taking custody of their son Fidelito; this angered Castro, who did not want his son growing up in a bourgeois environment.|$|E

[...] She lost 20 pounds from her normal weight of about 117 pounds, and reported that Portman [...] "became smaller than I did."

[...] Georgina Parkinson, a ballet mistress from the American Ballet Theatre (ABT), coached the actors in ballet. ABT soloists Sarah Lane and Maria Riccetto served as [...] "dance doubles" [...] for Portman and Kunis respectively. Dancer Kimberly Prosa also served as a double for Portman. She stated: [...] "Natalie took class, she studied for several months, from the waist up is her.
