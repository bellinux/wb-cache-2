40|$|Objective Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) {{have been}} implicated in both heart failure and {{atherosclerotic}} disease. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine associations between heart failure specific circulating miRNAs, atherosclerotic disease and cardiovascular-related outcome in patients with heart failure. Methods The levels of 11 heart failure-specific circulating miRNAs were compared in plasma of 114 heart failure patients with and without different manifestations of atherosclerotic disease. We then studied these miRNAs in relation to biomarkers associated to atherosclerosis and to cardiovascular-related rehospitalizations during 18 months of follow-up. Results At least one manifestation of atherosclerotic disease was found in 70 (61 %) of the heart failure patients. A consistent trend was found between an increasing number of manifestations of atherosclerosis (peripheral arterial disease in specific), and lower levels of miR- 18 a- 5 p, miR 27 a- 3 p, miR- 199 a- 3 p, miR- 223 - 3 p and miR- 652 - 3 p (all P < 0. 05). Target prediction and network analyses identified several interactions between miRNA targets and biomarkers related to inflammation, angiogenesis and endothelial dysfunction. Lower miRNA levels were associated with higher levels of these atherosclerosis-related biomarkers. In addition, lower miRNA levels were significantly associated with rehospitalizations due to cardiovascular causes within 18 months, with let- 7 i- 5 p as strongest predictor [HR 2. 06 (95 % CI 1. 29 - 3. 28), C-index 0. 70, P = 0. 002]. Conclusions A consistent pattern of lower levels of circulating miRNAs was found in heart failure patients with atherosclerotic disease, in particular peripheral arterial disease. In addition, lower levels of miRNAs were associated with <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>biomarkers</b> involved in atherosclerosis and an increased risk of a cardiovascular-related rehospitalization...|$|E
40|$|People {{with type}} 2 {{diabetes}} {{are at increased risk}} of age-related cognitive impairment. Previous literature has focused on case-control studies comparing rates of cognitive impairment in patients with and without diabetes. Investigations of potential risk factors for cognitive impairment (including those with increased prevalence in diabetes, such as macrovascular disease, and diabetes-specific factors such as hypoglycaemia) in study populations consisting exclusively of patients with {{type 2 diabetes}} have been largely neglected. Moreover, previous studies have failed {{to take advantage of the}} extensive characterisation and prospective nature of longitudinal cohort studies to investigate the relative predictive ability of a wider range of potential risk factors for cognitive decline. Using data from the prospective Edinburgh Type 2 Diabetes Study (ET 2 DS) the present thesis aimed (i) to determine associations of cognitive decline with macrovascular disease and with severe hypoglycaemia, and (ii) to compare a wider range of potential risk factors in their ability to predict cognitive decline. In 2006 / 2007, 1066 patients with type 2 diabetes (aged 60 to 75 years) attended the baseline ET 2 DS clinic and 831 returned for the follow-up at year 4. Subjects were extensively characterised for risk factor profiles at baseline, and at year 4 for incidence of severe hypoglycaemia. Socioeconomic status was estimated using postcode data. Scores on seven tests of age-sensitive ‘fluid’ cognitive function, which were administered at baseline and at year 4, were used to derive a general cognitive component (‘g’). A vocabulary-based test, administered at baseline, estimated pre-morbid ability. Findings are reported in three parts. 1.) Macrovascular disease and cognition: Subjects with <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>biomarkers</b> indicative of subclinical macrovascular disease, including plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and carotid intima-media thickness, had significantly steeper four-year cognitive decline, independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, stroke, socioeconomic status and estimated pre-morbid cognitive ability. For ankle-brachial pressure index, the association fell just short of statistical significance. Effect sizes were overall modest, with fully adjusted standardised beta coefficients ranging from 0. 06 to - 0. 12. Little evidence was found for associations of the symptomatic markers of macrovascular disease with four-year change in cognitive function that was independent of participants’ pre-morbid ability and socioeconomic status. 2.) Severe hypoglycaemia and cognition: Subjects with lower cognitive ability at baseline were at two-fold increased risk of experiencing their first-ever incident severe hypoglycaemia during follow-up. The rate of four-year cognitive decline was significantly steeper in those exposed to hypoglycaemia compared with hypoglycaemia-free participants, independently of cardiovascular risk factors, microand macrovascular disease and of estimated pre-morbid cognitive ability. Effect sizes again were overall modest (Cohen’s d = 0. 2 to 0. 3 for statistically significant differences in four-year cognitive decline between subjects with and those without hypoglycaemia, following multivariable adjustment) 3.) Consideration of a wider range of risk factors and cognition: A stepwise linear regression model including a total of 15 metabolic and vascular risk factors identified inflammation, smoking and poorer glycaemic control (in addition to some of the subclinical markers of macrovascular disease) as predictive of a steeper four-year cognitive decline. Other traditional cardiovascular risk factors, diabetic retinopathy, clinical macrovascular disease and a baseline history of severe hypoglycaemia were not included in this model. The interpretation of the latter finding is limited, however, by the fact that the stepwise regression procedure may exclude true predictors from a model when they correlate with already included risk factors. This thesis has demonstrated associations of later-life cognitive decline in people with type 2 diabetes with markers of subclinical macrovascular disease and poor glycaemic control (including hypoglycaemia) as well as other cardiometabolic risk factors (inflammation, smoking). Findings suggest that associations are relatively weak and complex due to inter-relationships amongst risk factors, and indicate a role of pre-morbid ability and socioeconomic status (which as risk factors are difficult to modify) in the relationships of risk factors with cognitive decline. Future research including case-control studies to compare risk factor associations between people with type 2 diabetes and non-diabetic older adults and randomised controlled trials to evaluate potential causal effects of individual modifiable risk factors on cognitive decline, will help to evaluate the mechanisms underlying the observation that people with type 2 diabetes are at risk of cognitive impairment in later life...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this thesis was to {{investigate}} various second and third-line systemic therapeutic options in severe sarcoidosis, that is refractory to first-line therapy, and to evaluate which patients benefit most from the different treatment options {{in order to find}} predictive markers for clinical decision making. We describe that azathioprine and methotrexate are equally effective in second-line treatment of sarcoidosis, except for a higher infection rate in the azathioprine group. Furthermore we found that patients with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>biomarkers</b> ACE and sIL- 2 R responded best to methotrexate treatment. Third line therapy with the biological drug infliximab was very effective and well-tolerated. Significant changes were seen in lung function, inflammation and quality of life. The most benefit in lung function was seen in patients with high activity on FDG-PET scan. These were also the patients with the highest relapse rate after discontinuation of the drug.

40|$|Men {{and women}} with lower {{extremity}} peripheral arterial disease (PAD) have <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> inflammatory <b>biomarkers</b> than those without PAD. Observational studies link <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> several inflammatory <b>biomarkers,</b> including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin- 6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and soluble adhesion molecules, to 1 {{or more of the}} following outcomes in people with PAD: more severe PAD, greater lower extremity functional impairment, more adverse calf skeletal muscle characteristics, greater declines in the ankle brachial index, greater declines in lower extremity performance, and higher rates of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. <b>Higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> inflammatory <b>biomarkers</b> are also associated with poorer outcomes after lower extremity revascularization, including graft restenosis and mortality. Increasing <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> CRP are associated with increased mortality and faster functional decline among people with PAD. Statin therapies reduce cardiovascular event rates and may improve walking performance in men {{and women with}} PAD, perhaps in part because statins can reduce inflammation. However, no clinical trials have been performed to establish whether therapies that specifically block or lower inflammatory biomarkers improve outcomes in patients with PAD. Family studies show that heritability of PAD ranges from approximately 20 % to 45 % after adjusting for atherosclerotic risk factors. A genetic marker for PAD has the potential to identify individuals at increased risk for PAD and may also uncover proteins that can help determine mechanisms of development of lower extremity atherosclerosis. However, a genetic marker for PAD has not been identified...|$|R
40|$|Cancer {{biomarkers}} facilitate {{screening and}} early detection but {{are known for}} only a few cancer types. We demonstrated the principle of inducing tumors to secrete a serum biomarker using a systemically administered gene delivery vector that targets tumors for selective expression of an engineered cassette. We exploited tumor-selective replication of a conditionally replicative Herpes simplex virus (HSV) combined with a replication-dependent late viral promoter to achieve tumor-selective biomarker expression as an example gene delivery vector. Virus replication, cytotoxicity and biomarker production were low in quiescent normal human foreskin keratinocytes and high in cancer cells in vitro. Following intravenous injection of virus > 90 % of tumor-bearing mice exhibited <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>biomarker</b> than non-tumor-bearing mice and upon necropsy, we detected virus exclusively in tumors. Our strategy of forcing tumors to secrete a serum biomarker could be useful for cancer screening in high-risk patients, and possibly for monitoring response to therapy. In addition, because oncolytic vectors for tumor specific gene delivery are cytotoxic, they may supplement our screening strategy as a "theragnostic" agent. The cancer screening approach presented in this work introduces a paradigm shift in the utility of gene delivery which we foresee being improved by alternative vectors targeting gene delivery and expression to tumors. Refining this approach will usher a new era for clinical cancer screening that may be implemented in the developed and undeveloped world...|$|R

METHODS: Participated in the study group (SG) 21 normal-hearing students from the tobacco-producing region, and {{in the control group}} (CG) 25 normal-hearing students who did not live in the countryside. The auditory system was assessed by DPOAE and the following biomarkers: dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) and micronucleus test (MN). RESULTS: Both groups showed DPOAE present in both ears. Significant difference was detected between groups - in the right ear in the frequency of 4. 000 Hz and in the left ear in the frequency of 2. 000 Hz - with the mean amplitude of the DPOAE of the SG lower than the one found in the CG. Considering both ears, the SG presented lower mean across all frequencies and it was found {{a significant difference in the}} frequencies of 2. 000 and 4. 000 Hz. The overall mean of DPOAE, by ear, no significant differences were observed. In relation to the rate of production of free radicals, the mean of the SG was significantly higher than that of the mean of the CG. For the frequency of abnormal cells in the MN test, the mean of the SG was also considerate significantly higher than the mean of the CG. CONCLUSION: The SG showed a lower response <b>level</b> <b>of</b> DPOAE at all frequencies and <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>biomarkers</b> <b>of</b> EO, however there was no association between assessments...|$|R

30|$|To date, several {{clinical}} studies investigated platelet markers in various conditions of critical illness. However, {{none of them}} searched for a potential association of these platelet markers with a risk for sepsis. Most of these studies described altered platelet phenotype in injured patients, characterized by either differential expression of platelet activation markers or platelet dysfunction as compared to healthy controls [23 – 28]. In ischemic stroke, two studies showed increased expression of platelet P-selectin and fibrinogen binding to platelets as compared to controls [25, 29]. The latter finding is interesting in view of our results, in particular since predisposition to severe pneumonia is clinically well established in such patients [30, 31].

Design: A cross sectional case controlled study. Main outcome measure: Anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory biomarkers. Materials and methods: Sixty-three obese women, body mass index (BMI) ⩾ 30 with PCOS and 45 obese women without PCOS, BMI ⩾  30 with normal menstrual pattern and normal morphology of the ovaries as controls. All cases were submitted to the estimation of waist circumference (WC), waist/hip ratio (WHR) and sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD) as well as fasting plasma glucose and fasting serum insulin and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) to estimate the insulin sensitivity. For all subjects anti-inflammatory biomarkers acting as insulin sensitizers as interleukin (IL) - 10, adiponectin, and pro-inflammatory biomarkers that depress insulin sensitivity as high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), prothrombin activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1), IL- 6, together with, total testosterone (TT), free androgen index (FAI), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) together with LH and FSH as well as total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) were estimated. Results: Thirty-three cases (52. 38 %) of PCOS and 23 cases (51. 11 %) of controls had android obesity and insulin resistance (IR) : QUIKI <  0. 330 and compensatory hyperinsulinemia (HI) and 30 cases (47. 61 %) of PCOS and 22 cases (48. 88 %) of controls had gluteofemoral (gynoid) obesity and normal insulin sensitivity (NIS).

Although prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is an established biomarker in prostate cancer, it provides only limited information relating to bone metastases and the treatment of metastatic bone disease with bisphosphonates or novel noncytotoxic targeted or biological agents that may provide clinical benefits without affecting PSA levels. As bone metastases develop, factors derived from bone metabolism are released into blood and urine, including N- and C-terminal peptide fragments of type 1 collagen and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, which represent potentially useful biomarkers for monitoring metastatic bone disease. A number of clinical trials have investigated these bone biomarkers {{with respect to their}} diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive values. Results suggest that <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> bone <b>biomarkers</b> are associated with an increased risk of skeletal-related events and/or death.

Methods Gender-specific risk factors for PAD were examined in a prospective cohort study of 1024 patients (184 women and 840 men) with stable coronary artery disease who were recruited between 2000 and 2002. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations between traditional and nontraditional risk factors and PAD in men and women. Results PAD was found in 11 % of women and in 13 % of men. Women with PAD had a similar prevalence of traditional risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking) compared with women without PAD and {{were significantly more likely}} to suffer from depression than women without PAD. Men with PAD were more likely to have hypertension, diabetes mellitus, a history of smoking, a worse lipid profile, and <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> inflammatory <b>biomarkers</b> than men without PAD.

During 1990 - 2008 altogether 542 495 drivers were tested. 1241 drunk drivers were caught (blood alcohol concentration, BAC = 0. 50) and 3087 drivers had drunk alcohol, but the limit was not exceeded. The commitment of the National Traffic Police to professional work made it possible to achieve reliableresults. The prevalence of drunk driving has been 0. 2 % with only random variations. The prevalence for drivers below the limit began to climb in the early 2000 s and peaked at 1. 11 % in 2005. The peak was mainly caused by drivers below 0. 2. Men had five times higher risk of driving drunk than women. Risk factors for recidivism were an earlier drunk driving offense, BAC= 1. 20 at the first time <b>of</b> conviction and <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> alcohol <b>biomarkers.</b> In substance abuse assessment in health care, attention should be paid more effectively to a person s overall life situation. The results strongly support the introduction of obligatory alcolocks at least for recidivists and aggravated drunk drivers...|$|R
40|$|ARDS is a {{heterogeneous}} syndrome that encompasses lung injury from both {{direct and indirect}} sources. Direct ARDS (pneumonia, aspiration) has been hypothesized to cause more severe lung epithelial injury than indirect ARDS (eg, nonpulmonary sepsis); however, this hypothesis has not been well studied in humans. We measured plasma <b>biomarkers</b> <b>of</b> lung epithelial and endothelial injury and inflammation in a single-center study of 100 patients with ARDS and severe sepsis and in a secondary analysis of 853 patients with ARDS drawn from a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Biomarker levels in patients with direct vs indirect ARDS were compared in both cohorts. In both studies, patients with direct ARDS had significantly <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> a <b>biomarker</b> <b>of</b> lung epithelial injury (surfactant protein D) and significantly lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> a <b>biomarker</b> <b>of</b> endothelial injury (angiopoietin- 2) than those with indirect ARDS. These associations were robust to adjustment for severity of illness and ARDS severity. In the multicenter study, patients with direct ARDS also had lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> von Willebrand factor antigen and IL- 6 and IL- 8, markers of endothelial injury and inflammation, respectively. The prognostic value <b>of</b> the <b>biomarkers</b> was similar in direct and indirect ARDS. Direct lung injury in humans {{is characterized by a}} molecular phenotype consistent with more severe lung epithelial injury and less severe endothelial injury. The opposite pattern was identified in indirect lung injury. Clinical trials of novel therapies targeted specifically at the lung epithelium or endothelium may benefit from preferentially enrolling patients with direct and indirect ARDS, respectively...|$|R

However, {{little is known about the}} mechanisms by which benefi t is conferred. This single-site, 15 -week randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study examined a range <b>of</b> <b>biomarkers</b> in 89 patients with osteoarthritis of the knees and/or hips to determine potential modes of action of SheaFlex 70 TM, a triterpene-rich extract of Vitellaria paradoxa. In the group <b>of</b> participants with <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> osteoarthritis <b>biomarkers</b> in the upper quartile at baseline, there were signifi cant decreases in infl am-mation and cartilage breakdown and trend level decreases in bone remodeling in the SheaFlex 70 TM group versus placebo between commencement and completion of the study. Infl ammation marker TNF-alpha fell 23. 9 % vs 6 % (treatment vs placebo), p = 0. 041. Cartilage degradation marker CTX-II fell 28. 7 % vs an increase of 17. 6 % (treatment vs placebo), p = 0. 018. This marker also showed signifi cant falls across the entire study group, 10. 6 % vs an increase of 11. 6 %, (treatment vs placebo), p = 0. 016. Osteocalcin levels fell 9. 2 %, p = 0. 014 (treatment) vs 1. 2 %, ns (placebo), p = 0. 096 (treatment vs placebo).

40|$|Fishermen who {{had participated}} in {{clean-up}} activities of the Prestige oil spill showed increased bronchial responsiveness and <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> respiratory <b>biomarkers</b> 2 years later. We aimed to evaluate the persistence of these functional and biological respiratory health effects 6 years after clean-up work. In 2008 / 2009 a follow-up study was done in 230 never-smoking fishermen who had been exposed to clean-up work in 2002 / 2003 and 87 non-exposed fishermen. Lung function and bronchial responsiveness testing and the determination <b>of</b> respiratory <b>biomarkers</b> in exhaled breath condensate were done identically as in the baseline survey in 2004 / 2005. Associations between participation in clean-up work and respiratory health parameters were assessed using linear and logistic regression analyses adjusting for sex and age. Information from 158 exposed (69 %) and 57 non-exposed (66 %) fishermen was obtained. Loss to follow-up in the non-exposed was characterised by less respiratory symptoms at baseline. During the 4 -year follow-up period lung function, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> respiratory <b>biomarkers</b> <b>of</b> oxidative stress and growth factors had deteriorated notably more among non-exposed than among exposed. At follow-up, respiratory health indices were similar or better in clean-up workers than in non-exposed. No clear differences between highly exposed and moderately exposed clean-up workers were found. In conclusion, we could not detect long-term respiratory health effects in clean-up workers 6 years after the Prestige oil spill. Methodological issues that need to be considered in this type of studies include the choice of a non-exposed control group and limitation of follow-up to subgroups such as never smokers.

40|$|Objectives Industrially {{contaminated}} sites (ICS) {{represent an}} important public health issue in European countries. The Silesian Voivodeship, the region {{located in the}} southern part of Poland, the historical center of industry, has many sites that meet ICS criteria. Most of them are landfills containing lead, cadmium and zinc. Material and Methods The aim of the study has been to evaluate determinants of lead and cadmium blood levels for preschool children living in the vicinity of selected environmental hazards in Piekary Śląskie, the city located in the region of Silesia. Data about exposure was obtained from the parental questionnaire and was verified by <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>biomarkers</b> in children’s blood. Finally, 678 preschool children were studied. Results Obtained results have confirmed that the statistically significant <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> lead in blood has been revealed in the case of younger children whose fathers have a <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> education and whose mothers smoke cigarettes at home, as well as for those living in the vicinity of any environmental hazard. In the case <b>of</b> cadmium, a <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> the <b>biomarker</b> has been reported for older children who rather do not live close to any environmental hazard. We have recognized 30 % of children with blood lead level (PbB) exceeding 2 μg/dl and 0. 8 % of children with blood cadmium level (CdB) exceeding the reference value (0. 5 μg/l). Conclusions Own observation has confirmed that preschool children living in Piekary Śląskie are still exposed to heavy metals existing in environment. The source <b>of</b> the <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> in blood is not only the hazardous vicinity in the place of residence but also well-known factors associated with the age of children, parental life style and educational background. The parental questionnaire could be useful to identify potential determinants of exposure to lead and cadmium, however exposure must be verified by measurement <b>of</b> a proper <b>biomarker.</b> Int J Occup Med Environ Health 2018; 31 (3) : 351 – 35...|$|R
40|$|Actuality of {{cardiovascular}} diseases today determines the high interest to study pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and to searching new risk factors which could help to optimize {{primary and secondary}} prevention. Study the correlation between <b>biomarkers</b> <b>of</b> inflammation and traditional risk factors (TRF) in patients with different forms of ischemic heart disease is really important today. Aim. To determine the correlation between TRF and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>biomarkers</b> <b>of</b> the inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Material and methods. Patients (n= 62) aged from 24 to 50 years (mean age 43. 98 ± 4. 73), who were {{admitted to the hospital}} due to ACS, were included into the study. Correlations between TRF and the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>biomarkers</b> <b>of</b> the inflammation and endothelial dysfunction were assessed. The following biomarkers levels were determined: high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), homocysteine, soluble vascular cell (sVCAM- 1) and intracellular (sICAM- 1) adhesion molecule type 1, soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin), nitrate, neopterin, matrix metalloproteinase type 3 (MMP- 3). Results. TRF, including modifiable ones, were often revealed in patients of the studied group. Some correlations between TRF and high concentrations <b>of</b> inflammatory <b>biomarkers</b> were determined. Patients with the family history of early cardiovascular diseases had higher concentration of sVCAM- 1 (1047. 78 ± 516. 98 ng/ml) in comparison with the patients without this TRF (705. 57 ± 239. 28 ng/ml), p= 0. 017. Patients with arterial hypertension had <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> MMP- 3 (9. 31 ± 3. 63 ng/ml) versus patients without hypertension (5. 02 ± 3. 66 ng/ml), р= 0. 011). Patients with abdominal obesity compared with patients without this TRF demonstrated higher concentration of nitrate in acute (208. 45 ± 91. 85 ng/ml vs 154. 53 ng/ml, р= 0. 028) and long-term (193. 53 ± 40. 02 ng/ml vs 173. 48 ng/ml, р= 0. 028) periods of ASC. Conclusion. The study showed the significant correlation between ТRF and <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> some <b>biomarkers</b> <b>of</b> inflammation and endothelial dysfunctions in patients with ACS. So it is probably associated with more rapid progression of the atherosclerosis, higher risk of atherothrombotic events, complicated course of ischemic heart disease and unfavorable outcomes. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) is a genomic {{imprinting}} disorder characterized by overgrowth and {{increased risk of}} malignancy. We studied the oxidative stress (OS) pattern of our patients with BWS and administered, for the first time, potassium ascorbate with ribose (PAR) once a day as long-term therapy in order to correct the effects induced by free radicals. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe the clinical features of three patients examined every three months in our clinic. OS was ascertained by measuring a panel of OS biomarkers: non-protein-binding iron, total hydroperoxides, advanced oxidation protein products, isoprostanes, carbonyl groups and thiols. After the presence of OS was established, treatment with PAR was started at the dosage of 300 mg of Potassium Bicarbonate and 150 mg of Ascorbic Acid in aqueous solution and changes occurring in OS biomarkers were followed dosing every three months. RESULTS: Our patients showed <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> OS <b>biomarkers</b> than controls {{at the time of}} diagnosis. There was a reduction in OS biomarker values for all three patients with treatment. No primary or secondary neoplastic disease was observed in 9 months of follow-up. CONCLUSION: This is the first report showing OS occurring in BWS. No drug until this report has been published showing efficacy against OS in any cancer. Given the limited number of patients, care must be taken to mitigate enthusiasm. We are collecting data for a large number of BWS patients to confirm these preliminary results.

40|$|Two or more {{histological}} types characterize {{more than}} 60 % of testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs). Burned-out testicular tumor refers to partial or complete histological regression {{of the primary}} testicular lesions. The most frequent GCT type involved {{in this kind of}} histological regression is choriocarcinoma, followed by embryonal carcinoma. To our knowledge, there are no cases of the burned-out phenomenon in teratoma. We report a case of a 19 -year-old man presenting to our institute with a right testicular lesion, evidence of mediastinal and abdominal lymph node metastasis, and <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> GCT serum <b>biomarkers.</b> After orchiectomy, the histopathological examination showed a mixed GCT: mature teratoma, immature teratoma, and histological features of testicular cancer regression (burned-out phenomenon). The patient underwent first-line chemotherapy (BEP regimen) which resulted in a complete instrumental and biochemical response after 4 cycles. Teratoma is considered a less aggressive type of GCT. In this particular case, metastatic disease seems to result from non-germ cell components which underwent early spontaneous regression...|$|R
40|$|Obesity {{has been}} linked with a chronic state of {{inflammation}} which {{may be involved in}} the development of metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and even cancer. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the association between obesity class and <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> inflammatory <b>biomarkers</b> from men and women who participated in the 1999 – 2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen were measured among US participants of the 1999 – 2004 NHANES. We examined biomarker levels across different weight classes with normal weight, overweight, and obesity classes 1, 2, and 3 were defined as BMI of < 25. 0, 25. 0 – 29. 9, 30. 0 – 34. 9, 35. 0 – 39. 9, and ≥ 40. 0, respectively. With CRP levels for normal weight individuals as a reference, CRP levels nearly doubled with each increase in weight class: + 0. 11  mg/dl (95 % CI, 0. 06 – 0. 16) for overweight, + 0. 21  mg/dl (95 % CI, 0. 16 – 0. 27) for obesity class 1, + 0. 43  mg/dl (95 % CI, 0. 26 – 0. 61) for obesity class 2, and + 0. 73  mg/dl (95 % CI, 0. 55 – 0. 90) for obesity class 3. With normal weight individuals as a reference, fibrinogen levels increase with increasing weight class and were highest for obesity class 3 individuals, + 93. 5  mg/dl (95 % CI, 72. 9 – 114. 1). Individuals with hypertension or diabetes have <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> CRP and fibrinogen levels compared to individuals without hypertension or diabetes, even when stratified according to BMI. There is a direct association between increasing obesity class and the presence of obesity-related comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> inflammatory <b>biomarkers...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{varicocele}} is {{an abnormal}} dilatation of the pampiniform plexus within the spermatic cord {{and is the}} most common and treatable cause of male infertility, with a variety of etiologies. Varicocelectomy increases the fertilization, pregnancy and live birth rates, indicating improved sperm function; it is therefore important even in couples undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection. However, despite ongoing extensive research on varicoceles, the exact mechanisms by which varicocele influences male infertility is not fully understood. Recent studies have shown that infertile men with varicocele have <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> oxidative stress (OS), and/or lower seminal antioxidant levels, than do fertile men and infertile men without varicocele. Heat stress has been shown {{as one of the most}} possible causes. The abnormally <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> seminal OS <b>biomarkers</b> in infertile men with varicocele is clinically relevant as these markers have been associated with poor sperm function and reduced fertility potential.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{reported}} <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> inflammatory <b>biomarkers</b> in hypertension, but data coming {{from the general population}} are sparse, and sex differences have been little explored. The CoLaus Study is a cross-sectional examination survey in a random sample of 6067 Caucasians aged 35 - 75 years in Lausanne, Switzerland. Blood pressure (BP) was assessed using a validated oscillometric device. Anthropometric parameters were also measured, including body composition, using electrical bioimpedance. Crude serum <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and ultrasensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were positively and IL- 1 β (IL- 1 β) negatively (P< 0. 001 for all values), associated with BP. For IL- 6, IL- 1 β and TNF-α, the association disappeared in multivariable analysis, largely explained by differences in age and body mass index, in particular fat mass. On the contrary, hsCRP remained independently and positively associated with systolic (β (95 % confidence interval) : 1. 15 (0. 64; 1. 65); P< 0. 001) and diastolic (0. 75 (0. 42; 1. 08); P< 0. 001) BP. Relationships of hsCRP, IL- 6 and TNF-α with BP tended to be stronger in women than in men, partly related to the difference in fat mass, yet the interaction between sex and IL- 6 persisted after correction for all tested confounders. In the general population, the associations between inflammatory <b>biomarkers</b> and rising <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> BP are mainly driven by age and fat mass. The stronger associations in women suggest that sex differences might exist in the complex interplay between BP and inflammation...|$|R
40|$|In {{critical}} illness, such as sepsis or {{the acute}} respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury (AKI) is common and associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Mechanical ventilation in critical illnesses is also {{a risk factor for}} AKI, but it is potentially modifiable. Injurious ventilation strategies may lead to the systemic release of inflammatory mediators from the lung due to ventilator induced lung injury (VILI). The systemic consequences of VILI are difficult to differentiate clinically from other systemic inflammatory syndromes, such as sepsis. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify unique changes in the expression of inflammatory mediators in kidney tissue in response to VILI compared with systemic sepsis to gain insight into direct effects of VILI on the kidney. Four groups of mice were compared-mice with sepsis from cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), mice subjected to injurious mechanical ventilation with high tidal volumes (VILI), mice exposed to CLP followed by VILI (CLP+VILI), and sham controls. Protein expression of common inflammatory mediators in kidneys was analyzed using a proteome array and confirmed by Western blot analysis or ELISA. VEGF and VCAM- 1 were found to be significantly elevated in kidneys from VILI mice compared with sham and CLP. Angiopoietin- 2 was significantly increased in CLP+VILI compared with CLP alone and was also correlated with <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> AKI <b>biomarker,</b> neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin. These results suggest that VILI alters the renal expression of VEGF, VCAM- 1, and angiopoietin- 2, and these proteins warrant further investigation as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets...|$|R
