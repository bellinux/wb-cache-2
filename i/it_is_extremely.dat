5|$|Fluorine is a {{chemical}} element with symbol F and atomic number 9. It is the lightest halogen and exists {{as a highly}} toxic pale yellow diatomic gas at standard conditions. As the most electronegative element, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> reactive: almost all other elements, including some noble gases, form compounds with fluorine.|$|E
5|$|Benign conditions, {{sometimes}} {{also referred}} to as confined water, are environments of low risk, where <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> unlikely or impossible for the diver to get lost or entrapped, or be exposed to hazards other than the basic underwater environment. These conditions are suitable for initial training in the critical survival skills, and include swimming pools, training tanks, aquarium tanks and some shallow and protected shoreline areas.|$|E

However, it may have formed more recently, perhaps as ejecta from a large impact on Ida. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> unlikely that it was captured by Ida. Dactyl may have suffered a major impact around 100 million years ago, which reduced its size.|$|E

5|$|Kohlberg's six stages {{can be more}} {{generally}} grouped into three levels of two stages each: pre-conventional, conventional and post-conventional. Following Piaget's constructivist requirements for a stage model, as described in his theory of cognitive development, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> rare to regress in stages—to lose the use of higher stage abilities. Stages cannot be skipped; each provides a new and necessary perspective, more comprehensive and differentiated than its predecessors but integrated with them.|$|E
5|$|Layers {{deposited}} {{during the}} Pleistocene epoch, starting around two million years ago, cover most of eastern South Dakota. These are the youngest rock and sediment layers in the state, {{and are the}} product of several successive periods of glaciation which deposited a large amount of rocks and soil, known as till, over the area. The thickness of the glacial till layer ranges between 100 and 900 feet (30 and 270 m). This till is also what makes agriculture more prevalent in eastern South Dakota as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> fertile.|$|E
5|$|MRO's main {{computer}} is a 133MHz, 10.4million transistor, 32-bit, RAD750 processor. This processor is a radiation-hardened {{version of a}} PowerPC 750 or G3 processor with a specially built motherboard. The RAD750 is a successor to the RAD6000. This processor may seem underpowered in comparison to a modern PC processor, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> reliable, resilient, and can function in solar flare-ravaged deep space. The operating system software is VxWorks and has extensive fault protection protocols and monitoring.|$|E

5|$|One catechesis of Symeon's, On Faith, {{along with}} a {{composite}} work titled One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts, {{are included in the}} Philokalia, a collection of texts by early Christian mystics. Another text in the Philokalia, titled The Three Methods of Prayer is also attributed to Symeon—it describes a method of practicing the Jesus Prayer that includes direction on correct posture and breathing while reciting the prayer. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> unlikely that he wrote that text—some scholars attribute it to Nikiphoros the Monk, while others believe it was written by disciples of Symeon.|$|E
5|$|The {{final step}} of {{drinking}} water treatment is disinfection to ensure that final drinking water is free from infectious microorganisms. As suspended particles (turbidity) can provide a growth substrate for microorganisms and can protect them from disinfection treatment, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> important that the water treatment process achieves a good level of removal of suspended particles.|$|E
5|$|The geology of Shetland {{is quite}} different. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> complex, with {{numerous}} faults and fold axes. These islands are the northern outpost of the Caledonian orogeny {{and there are}} outcrops of Lewisian, Dalriadan and Moine metamorphic rocks with similar histories to their equivalents on the Scottish mainland. There are also small Old Red Sandstone deposits and granite intrusions. The most distinctive feature is the ultrabasic ophiolite, peridotite and gabbro on Unst and Fetlar, which are remnants of the Iapetus Ocean floor. Much of Shetland's economy depends on the oil-bearing sediments in the surrounding seas.|$|E

5|$|As its {{common name}} suggests, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> bitter, though not toxic as such. This {{bitterness}} is worsened by cooking. One specimen can foul {{the taste of}} a whole meal prepared with mushrooms. Despite this, it is sold in local markets (tianguis) in Mexico. A local recipe from France, Romania and East Germany calls for stewing it in skimmed milk after which it can be eaten, or powdered and used for flavouring. The mushroom is not bitter for those who lack genetic sensitivity to bitter taste, a trait endowed by the gene TAS2R38 (taste receptor 2 member 38). The compound responsible for the bitter taste has not been identified.|$|E
5|$|Feeding {{mainly on}} cephalopods, bony fishes, and other {{cartilaginous}} fishes, the copper shark is a fast-swimming predator {{that has been}} known to hunt in large groups, utilizing their numbers to their advantage; however for {{most of the time they}} remain solitary. Off South Africa, this species associates closely with the annual sardine run, involving millions of southern African pilchard (Sardinops sagax). Like other requiem sharks, it is viviparous, with the developing embryos mainly nourished through a placental connection formed from the depleted yolk sac. Females bear litters of 7 to 24 pups every other year in coastal nursery areas, after a gestation period of 12 or perhaps as long as 21 months. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> slow-growing, with males and females not reaching maturity until 13–19 and 19–20 years of age respectively.|$|E
5|$|Human {{occupation}} {{dates back}} to the Beaker culture of the late Bronze Age. There is also evidence of an Iron Age hill fort and prehistoric barrows and field systems. There is evidence of a shrine dating from pre-Roman times, which was re-established as a Romano-Celtic Temple in the mid-4th century. According to at least one source, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> likely this was succeeded by a small late-4th-century Christian oratory. Several Roman finds including gold coins of Augustus, Nero, and Drusus, two silver denarii of Vespasian and a Roman carnelian ring were found at the site during quarrying.|$|E

5|$|The greater {{adjutant}} is omnivorous {{and although}} mainly a scavenger, it preys on frogs and large insects and will also take birds, reptiles and rodents. It {{has been known}} to attack wild ducks coming within reach and swallowing them whole. Their main diet however is carrion and like the vultures their bare head and neck is an adaptation. They are often found on garbage dumps and will feed on animal and human excreta. In 19th-century Calcutta, they fed on partly burnt human corpses disposed along the Ganges river. In Rajasthan, where <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> rare, it has been reported to feed on swarms of desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) but this has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|The {{virtue of}} a {{practical}} realization based upon this definition is that unlike the Kibble balance and other scale-based methods, {{all of which}} require the careful characterization of gravity in the laboratory, this method delineates {{the magnitude of the}} kilogram directly in the very terms that define the nature of mass: acceleration due to an applied force. Unfortunately, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> difficult to develop a practical realization based upon accelerating masses. Experiments {{over a period of years}} in Japan with a superconducting, 30g mass supported by diamagnetic levitation never achieved an uncertainty better than ten parts per million. Magnetic hysteresis was one of the limiting issues. Other groups performed similar research that used different techniques to levitate the mass.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds {{crystallize}} in {{the diamond}} cubic crystal system (space group Fdm) and consist of tetrahedrally, covalently bonded carbon atoms. A second form called lonsdaleite, with hexagonal symmetry, {{has also been}} found, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> rare and forms only in meteorites or in laboratory synthesis. The local environment of each atom is identical in the two structures. From theoretical considerations, lonsdaleite {{is expected to be}} harder than diamond, but the size and quality of the available stones are insufficient to test this hypothesis. In terms of crystal habit, diamonds occur most often as euhedral (well-formed) or rounded octahedra and twinned, flattened octahedra with a triangular outline. Other forms include dodecahedra and (rarely) cubes. There is evidence that nitrogen impurities {{play an important role in}} the formation of well-shaped euhedral crystals. The largest diamonds found, such as the Cullinan Diamond, were shapeless. These diamonds are pure (i.e. type II) and therefore contain little if any nitrogen.|$|E

5|$|During {{the process}} of meiotic cell division, an event called genetic {{recombination}} or crossing-over can sometimes occur, in which a length of DNA on one chromatid is swapped with a length of DNA on the corresponding homologous non-sister chromatid. This can result in reassortment of otherwise linked alleles. The Mendelian principle of independent assortment asserts that each of a parent's two genes for each trait will sort independently into gametes; which allele an organism inherits for one trait is unrelated to which allele it inherits for another trait. This is in fact only true for genes that do not reside on the same chromosome, or are located very far from one another on the same chromosome. The closer two genes lie on the same chromosome, the more closely they will be associated in gametes and the more often they will appear together; genes that are very close are essentially never separated because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> unlikely that a crossover point will occur between them. This is known as genetic linkage.|$|E
5|$|Fourteen {{species of}} seabirds breed on the island. Red-tailed tropicbirds {{can be seen}} in large numbers {{circling}} the Malabar cliffs where they perform acrobatic courting rituals. Between August and May thousands of flesh-footed and wedge-tailed shearwaters return to the island at dusk each day. From the Little Island Track between March and November one of the world's rarest birds, the providence petrel also performs courtship displays during winter breeding and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> tame. The island was its only breeding location for many years after the breeding colony on Norfolk Island was exterminated in the late 19th century; though a small population persists on the adjacent Phillip Island. The Kermadec petrel was discovered breeding on Mount Gower in 1914 by ornithologist Roy Bell while collecting specimens for Gregory Mathews and the black-winged petrel was only confirmed as a breeder in 1971; its numbers have increased following the elimination of feral cats from the island.|$|E
5|$|In the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus {{experimented with}} amber rods and these {{experiments}} {{were the first}} studies into the production of electrical energy. While this method, {{now known as the}} triboelectric effect, can lift light objects and generate sparks, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> inefficient. It was not until the invention of the voltaic pile in the eighteenth century that a viable source of electricity became available. The voltaic pile, and its modern descendant, the electrical battery, store energy chemically and make it available on demand in the form of electrical energy. The battery is a versatile and very common power source which is ideally suited to many applications, but its energy storage is finite, and once discharged it must be disposed of or recharged. For large electrical demands electrical energy must be generated and transmitted continuously over conductive transmission lines.|$|E
