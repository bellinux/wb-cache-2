40|$|The {{presence}} of a bright light source in the visual field, particularly when viewed against a dark background, can generate a form of discomfort, which {{is often described as}} ‘discomfort glare’. The mechanisms for <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> remain poorly understood, even after 50 years of multidisciplinary research in this field. The aim of this investigation was to investigate a number of relevant parameters that can affect <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> in order to gain insights into the corresponding mechanisms. We measured retinal illuminance levels for <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> at threshold as a function of source size, eccentricity and surrounding background luminance. In addition, the pupil size was measured throughout and related to the measured thresholds for <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare.</b> A group of 50 subjects with normal visual acuity and no clinical signs of eye disease took part in the primary study that measured <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> thresholds as a function of source size. A light ‘homogenizer’ was used to integrate the concentrated light output from a quad LED light source. Pulse frequency modulation was used to control the intensity of the source and continuous pupil size measurements made it possible to calculate retinal illuminance. <b>Discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> thresholds were estimated by measuring the retinal illuminance of the glare source at threshold using a staircase procedure. <b>Discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> thresholds were measured as a function of glare source area, eccentricity and background luminance. The amplitude of pupil constriction was also measured both below and above the <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> threshold. A model of contrast vision with the filtering of a photoreceptor signal through centre-surround ganglion cells was developed to account for the small size dependence of <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> thresholds that was observed experimentally. Another model for scattered light was applied to compute the corresponding pupil constriction amplitude caused by the integrated photoreceptor signals generated by the glare source both within and outside the stimulus area. The threshold for <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> decreased gradually with glare source size and increased with background luminance and showed little dependence on glare source eccentricity. The effect of forward light scatter in the eye was also investigated and a model was developed to account for the continued increase in pupil response amplitude well above the <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> threshold. The effect of glare source size on <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> thresholds could be predicted by a model involving photoreceptor saturation and edge response. When the scattered light outside the stimulus area was also taken into account, the pupil constriction amplitude increased log-linearly with stimulus retinal illuminance both below and above <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> thresholds. These findings suggest that <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> depended largely on the localised retinal illuminance and could be accounted for by the saturation of photoreceptor signals in the retina. The results and the pupil modeling work also suggest that the pupil response to light flux increments continued well above the <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> threshold, {{largely as a result of}} light scattered outside the area of the glare source...|$|E

40|$|The Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) {{published}} {{a system for}} visual performance-based mesopic photometry in 2010. It is valid between the luminances 0. 005 cd/m 2 and 5 cd/m 2. In night-time driving conditions, the luminances in the visual scene are in the mesopic range; thus, mesopic photometry should be adopted when assessing lighting in outdoor areas and other night-time traffic environments. In order to implement the CIE mesopic photometry, the background photopic luminance, i. e. adaptation luminance, is required as an input value. The aim {{of the study is}} to develop methods for estimating the field of view of which the luminance is to be used as the adaptation luminance in implementing the CIE 191 system for mesopic photometry. This is realised by applying methods such as combining eye-tracking data with corresponding luminance data and analysing peripheral target detection under uniform and non-uniform luminous backgrounds. In the study of combining eye-tracking measurements with luminance data, the visual scene areas with the highest density of gaze distributions were determined. The measured luminances for these visual scenes were used to form an estimate of the adaptation luminance under different driving conditions in the lit and the unlit sections of a rural road. The mean luminances of the estimated fields were higher in the unlit section than in the lit section of the route for all drivers. This was due to high-beam head-lights that illuminated the road surface, whereas the gaze points were concentrated in the unlit section. Experiments in laboratory conditions were conducted in order to obtain the effect of background and target location and its luminance on visual performance. Reaction time and contrast threshold measurements were made to analyse peripheral target detection in uniform and non-uniform backgrounds. Under non-uniform background luminances, peripheral target detection depends on the local luminance of the target and the luminance uniformity of the surrounding area of the target. The results verify that each part of the retina adjusts its sensitivity independently, which refers to local adaptation. However, the complexity of the visual field also has an effect on visual sensitivity in peripheral vision. Further studies, where road type, driving speed and <b>discomforting</b> <b>glare</b> are taken into account, are needed to define the visual adaptation field and corresponding adaptation luminance in various driving conditions...|$|R

Recently, both anecdotal reports and formal experiments have indicated that headlamp size and spectral power distribution affect <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare,</b> but no assessment {{has been made of}} whether these two factors also affect disability glare. Models of disability glare suggest that they should not. The present experiment was designed to provide empirical evidence about this issue. Subjects were presented with glare stimuli that varied in size (0. 3 or 0. 6 degrees of visual angle) and spectral power distribution (tungsten-halogen or high-intensity discharge). <b>Discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> was measured by numerical ratings of subjective discomfort. Disability glare was measured by determining the luminance threshold for detecting a pedestrian silhouette presented near the glare source. Spectral power distribution affected <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare,</b> although, in contrast to previous studies, which had shown small but statistically significant effects, size did not affect <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare.</b> Neither variable affected disability glare. These results indicate that, for size and spectral power distribution, effects on <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> do not necessarily imply effects on disability glare. The fact that small, high-intensity discharge lamps do not seem to cause any special problems with disability glare under the conditions of this experiment is encouraging, particularly because disability glare is likely to have greater effects on safety than <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare.</b> However, given the importance of the issue, further studies of disability glare would be valuable.

In contrast to the case of disability glare we understand very little about the underlying mechanisms or physiology of <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare.</b> This study attempts to elucidate the neural mechanisms involved using fMRI and glare sources with controlled levels of retinal illuminance.

Three subjects had reflex tearing during the NITBUT measurement, and nine subjects had either NITBUTb or NITBUTw values > 45 s, so their data were excluded. For the 46 subjects with NITBUT ≤ 45 s, no significant difference between NITBUTb and NITBUTw was found (Wilcoxon test p = 0. 156). No statistically significant relationship was found between NITBUTb and NITBUTw (Spearman r = 0. 217, p = 0. 147).

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the major}} factors in verifying {{the way in which}} {{internal}} environments and buildings are qualified by people is daylight. The role of daylight in day to day basis and the fact of providing internal space quality make it that important.

Besides being one of the most efficient sources of energy, not to mention the fact that it’s completely free, there are other important aspects that should not be overlooked before entering the building. Generally, it is considered a pleasure to have daylight inside the building unless it distracts the occupants from accomplishing their daily tasks such as glare from computer screens as this can reduce productivity of offices and creates eye strain.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the study}} was to analyze <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> {{sensation}} in subjects aged 50 years and more in comparison with younger subjects (i. e. younger than 35 years of age). Material and Methods: The experiments were performed on a computer workstation placed in controlled lighting environment where 2 <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> conditions were modeled. Each participant performed for about 1 h specially designed visual tasks, including the tests with Landolt's rings presented on the screen by a computer program. The glare evaluation method consisted of subjective evaluation of <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> on the semantic glare rating scale, tests of mesopic contrast and glare sensitivity, subjective assessment of lighting quality and asthenopic symptoms. The time needed to perform the task and the number of mistakes were also recorded. The subjective evaluation of glare was compared with the Unified Glare Rating (UGR) index calculated by the DIALux simulation program. Results: A higher percentage of the younger group subjects assessed glare after the experimental session as uncomfortable and intolerable than in the 50 + group, who more often assessed glare as acceptable. The assessment of <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> in the younger group corresponded to higher UGR value compared to UGR value calculated by DIALux. In the 50 + group, such correlation was found only for lower <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> (UGR = 19). The results showed that younger participants more frequently suffered from visual fatigue and assessed lighting as less comfortable. However, the mesopic glare sensitivity increased significantly after the experiments only in the 50 + group under both glare conditions.

The younger population seems to be more sensitive and demanding than the older one in relation to <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> limiting, in spite of the lack of significant objective measures of fatigue. The exposure of the elderly to bigger <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> could adversely affect the objective measures of fatigue like mesopic glare sensitivity and visual performance...|$|E
40|$|This {{laboratory}} {{study investigated the}} effects of stimulus duration {{and the nature of}} visual correction on <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare.</b> The experimental setup simulated a nighttime driving situation with an opposing glare source at 3. 5 ° of visual angle. There were 25 different glare stimuli, obtained by combining each of five levels of duration (ranging from 0. 125 to 2 seconds) with each of five levels of illuminance (ranging from 0. 5 to 8 lux). Two groups of subjects participated: those needing no visual correction, and those needing correction and having both contact lenses and spectacles. The latter group of subjects used their contact lenses in one half of the trials and their spectacles in {{the other half of the}} trials. <b>Discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> was evaluated using the de Boer discomfort-glare scale. Neither presence of correction (either contact lenses or spectacles versus no correction) nor type of correction (contact lenses versus spectacles) had a statistically significant effect on <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare.</b> When averaged across all subjects, both duration and illuminance had statistically significant effects on <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare,</b> although subjects' discomfort judgments were less affected by duration than by illuminance. Both relationships were well described by log-linear functions. Using these two functions, we generated predictions about the likely changes in <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> as a consequence of selected changes in duration, and about the changes in duration and illuminance with equivalent effects on <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare.</b> For example, a 25 % reduction in duration is predicted to reduce <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare</b> by 0. 2 de Boer units, and be functionally equivalent to an 11 % reduction in illuminance. However, there were wide variations between subjects in the relationship between duration and <b>discomfort</b> <b>glare.</b> These findings imply that, for the effectiveness of headlamp automatic-leveling systems and variablereflectance mirrors, the control of duration is less important than the control of peak illuminance, at least for transient elevations in illuminance that are relatively brief...|$|E

In this study, the daylighting and thermal performance of "bottom-up" shades was presented. The bottom-up is a motorized roller shade that operates in reverse of a conventional roller shade (opens from top to bottom), so as to cover the bottom part of the window, providing privacy to the occupants, while allowing daylight to enter from the top section. A daylighting simulation model, validated with experimental results, was developed in order to establish correlations between the shade position, outdoor illuminance and work plane illuminance for different outdoor conditions as well as to allow a sensitivity analysis of the impact of shade optical properties on the results. Moreover, the model was used to compare "bottom-up" shades with conventional roller shades. The results showed that the Daylight Autonomy (DA) for the bottom-up is 8 %- 58 % higher than the DA for a conventional roller shade, with a difference of 46 % at the back part of the room, away from the façade, where the use of artificial lighting is usually more needed, proving the advantage of bottom-up shade versus conventional roller shades, by allowing the natural light to enter from the top section of the façade deep into the room.

The optimization problem admits four objective functions (thermal discomfort during winter and summer and visual <b>discomfort</b> due to <b>glare</b> and an inappropriate quantity of daylight) and uses the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm, implemented in the GenOpt optimization engine through the Java genetic algorithms package, to instruct the EnergyPlus simulation engine. The simulation outcome is a four-dimensional solution set. The building variants of the Pareto frontier adopt diverse and non-intuitive design alternatives. To derive good design practices, two-dimensional projections of the solution set were also analyzed. Finally, in cases of complex optimization problems with many objective functions, optimization techniques are recommended to effectively explore the large number of available building variants in a relatively short time and, hence, identify viable non-intuitive solutions...|$|R
40|$|Lighting {{accounts}} for approximately 54 % {{of the annual}} energy consumption of office buildings, and can effectively be reduced through daylighting. The simplest way to provide day lighting into a typical office space has been to use unilateral sidelighting. <b>Discomfort</b> and visibility <b>glare</b> from unilateral sidelighting cause the occupant to close drapes or blinds and turn on luminaries, resulting in an inefficient use of daylighting. One daylighting concept that has been developed to alleviate this problem is the light plenum. A light plenum can be added economically to an office space by using a hung ceiling simultaneously as a return air and light plenum. The appropriate opaque ceiling panels could be replaced with transparent ones to get the light {{to the rear of}} the space. The question is how much light can be expected to be transferred {{to the rear of the}} room and how different plenum opening configurations would affect those light levels. The result simply that a hung ceiling light plenum can provide adequate light to the rear of the room to balance the high brightness ratios created by unilateral sidelighting. Also, certain plenum opening configurations are more advantageous for certain sky conditions and orientations, and there are some which are of no benefit...|$|R
