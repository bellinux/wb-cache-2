25|$|Furthermore, {{investors have}} {{doubts about the}} {{possibilities}} of policy makers to quickly contain the crisis. Since countries that use the euro as their currency have fewer monetary policy choices (e.g., they cannot print money in their own currencies to pay debt holders), certain solutions require multi-national cooperation. Further, the European Central Bank has an inflation control mandate but not an employment mandate, {{as opposed to the}} U.S. Federal Reserve, which has a <b>dual</b> <b>mandate.</b>|$|E

25|$|Upon the {{creation}} of the Dominion of Canada in 1867, Macdonald became Prime Minister and Cartier was his Minister of Militia and Defence. As the law of the time allowed a <b>dual</b> <b>mandate</b> in both the federal and provincial governments, Cartier ran in the 1867 Quebec provincial election in Montréal-Est electoral district. Cartier was elected as a Conservative supporter of the Pierre-Joseph-Olivier Chauveau government. As a result, Cartier was both a member of the Parliament of Canada and the Legislative Assembly of Quebec.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} policy stance currently dominant {{around the world}} uses unemployment as a policy tool to control inflation; when cost pressures rise, the standard monetary policy {{carried out by the}} monetary authority (central bank) tightens interest rates, creating a buffer stock of unemployed people, which reduces wage demands, and ultimately inflation. When inflationary expectations subside, these people will get their jobs back. In Marxian terms, the unemployed serve as a reserve army of labor. By contrast, in a job guarantee program, a buffer stock of employed people (employed in the job guarantee program) provides the same protection against inflation without the social costs of unemployment, hence potentially fulfilling the <b>dual</b> <b>mandate</b> of full employment and price stability.|$|E
2500|$|The U.S. Congress {{established}} {{three key}} objectives for monetary {{policy in the}} Federal Reserve Act: maximizing employment, stabilizing prices, and moderating long-term interest rates. The first two objectives are {{sometimes referred to as}} the Federal Reserve's <b>dual</b> <b>mandate.</b> Its duties have expanded over the years, and [...] also include supervising and regulating banks, maintaining the stability of the financial system and providing financial services to depository institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign official institutions. The Fed conducts research into the economy and provides numerous publications, such as the Beige Book and the FRED database.|$|E

On the same day {{he was elected to the}} Fingal County Council for the Castleknock electoral area, topping the poll. Due to <b>dual</b> <b>mandate</b> rules, Higgins vacated this council seat in July 2009 and was replaced by Matt Waine. He was a member of the European United Left–Nordic Green Left (EUL–NGL) group in the European Parliament, the European Parliament's Committee on International Trade, the delegation for relations with the countries of South Asia. [...] He was also a substitute member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the Committee on Petitions and the delegation for relations with the Mercosur countries.|$|E
2500|$|At the November 2010 FOMC meeting, Warsh was {{extremely}} {{skeptical of the}} Fed's plan to generate economic activity and jobs by trying to lower long-term interest rates. Although unemployment was close to 10%, Warsh told his colleagues that he would only vote for QE2 {{out of respect for}} Chairman Bernanke: [...] "If I were in your chair, I would not be leading the Committee in this direction, and frankly, if I were in the chair of most people around this room, I would dissent." [...] Even if unemployment were [...] "unacceptably high," [...] he suggested that he would vote against the program continuing if inflation inched up a bit: [...] "if inflation were to move up and were to be broadly consistent with the implicit inflation target [...] in different people's minds around this room, even if unemployment were unacceptably high, I think that would be time to stop this program. If inflation expectations were {{to move out of the}} range that they have been in for a long time, that would be a reason to end this program, even if unemployment were exceptionally high and GDP were well below what we think the economy is ultimately capable of." [...] The Federal Reserve has a legal <b>dual</b> <b>mandate</b> to pursue maximum employment as well as to ensure price stability.|$|E
5000|$|Originally, MEPs were {{nominated}} by national parliamentarians from among their own membership. Prior {{to the first}} direct elections in 1979, the <b>dual</b> <b>mandate</b> was discussed. Some advocated banning it, arguing that MEPs who were national MPs were often absent from one assembly in order to attend the other (indeed, the early death of Peter Michael Kirk was blamed by his election agent on overwork resulting from his <b>dual</b> <b>mandate).</b> Others claimed that members with a <b>dual</b> <b>mandate</b> enhanced communication between national and European assemblies. There was a particular interest in the <b>dual</b> <b>mandate</b> question in Denmark: Eurosceptic Danish Social Democrats supported a compulsory <b>dual</b> <b>mandate,</b> {{to ensure that the}} state's MEPs expressed the same views as the national legislature, and the government of Denmark supported a compulsory <b>dual</b> <b>mandate</b> when the other eight member states supported an optional <b>dual</b> <b>mandate.</b> [...] However, a 1976 European Parliament law preparing for the 1979 elections expressly permitted a <b>dual</b> <b>mandate.</b> In 1978 the German politician Willy Brandt suggested that one third of MEPs should be national MPs.|$|E

50|$|The Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 {{is an act}} of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

At the provincial level, the situation varies from one province to another.|$|R

50|$|A <b>dual</b> <b>mandate</b> is the {{practice}} in which elected officials serve {{in more than one}} elected or other public position simultaneously. This practice is sometimes known as double jobbing in Britain (not to be confused with double dipping in the United States, i.e. being employed by and receiving a retirement pension from the same public authority at the same time). Thus, if someone who is already mayor of a town or city councillor becomes elected as MP or senator at the national or state legislature and retains both positions, this is a <b>dual</b> <b>mandate.</b>|$|E
