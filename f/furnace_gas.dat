25|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} {{has been}} proposed {{for use as a}} fuel on Mars. Carbon monoxide/oxygen engines have been suggested for early surface transportation use as both carbon monoxide and oxygen can be straightforwardly produced from the atmosphere of Mars by zirconia electrolysis, without using any Martian water resources to obtain hydrogen, which would be needed to make methane or any hydrogen-based fuel. Likewise, blast <b>furnace</b> <b>gas</b> collected at the top of blast furnace, still contains some 10% to 30% of carbon monoxide, and is used as fuel on Cowper stoves and on Siemens-Martin furnaces on open hearth steelmaking.|$|E

5000|$|In a blast furnace, joint {{products}} are pig iron, slag and blast <b>furnace</b> <b>gas.</b> The iron is a precursor of steel, the slag {{can be sold}} as construction material, and the gas is used to reheat Cowper stoves.

50|$|Blast <b>furnace</b> <b>gas</b> (BFG) is a {{by-product}} of blast furnaces that is generated when the iron ore is reduced with coke to metallic iron. It has a very low heating value, about 93 BTU/cubic foot (3.5 MJ/m³, because it consists of about 60 percent nitrogen and 18-20% carbon dioxide, which are not flammable. The rest is mostly carbon monoxide, which has a fairly low heating value already and some (2-4%) hydrogen. It is commonly used as a fuel within the steel works, {{but it can be}} used in boilers and power plants equipped to burn it. It may be combined with natural gas or coke oven gas before combustion or a flame support with richer gas or oil is provided to sustain combustion. Particulate matter is removed {{so that it can be}} burned more cleanly. Blast <b>furnace</b> <b>gas</b> is sometimes flared without generating heat or electricity.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, {{internal}} combustion gas engines {{were developed to}} burn gasses produced from blast furnaces, {{eliminating the need for}} fuel for steam boilers and increasing efficiency.

The Gasometer was built as a buffer: storing excess gas and releasing it again when demand exceeded production.|$|E
