40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a NASA Innovative Advanced Concept (NIAC) Phase 2 study entitled "An Innovative Solution to NASA's Near-Earth Object (NEO) Impact Threat Mitigation Grand Challenge and Flight Validation Mission Architecture Development. " This NIAC Phase 2 study was conducted at the Asteroid Deflection Research Center (ADRC) of Iowa State University in 2012 - 2014. The study objective was to develop an innovative yet practically implementable mitigation strategy for the most probable impact threat of an asteroid or comet with short warning time (< 5 years). The mitigation strategy described in this paper is intended to optimally reduce the severity and catastrophic damage of the NEO impact event, especially when we don't have sufficient warning times for non-disruptive deflection of a hazardous NEO.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} how the handling of visual media objects is implemented in the visual information retrieval project VizIR. Essentially, four areas are concerned: media access, media representation in user interfaces, visualisation of media-related data and media transport over the network. The paper offers <b>detailed</b> <b>technical</b> <b>descriptions</b> of the solutions developed in VizIR for these areas. Unified media access for images and video is implemented through class MediaContent. This class contains methods to access the view on a media object {{at any point in}} time as well as methods to change the colour model and read/write format parameters (size, length, frame-rate). Based on this low-level-API class VisualCube allows accessing spatio-temporal areas in temporal media randomly. Transformer-classes allow to modify visual objects in a very simple but effective way. Visualisation of media object is implemented in class MediaRenderer. Each MediaRenderer represents one media object and is responsible for any aspect of its visualisation. In the paper examples for reasonable implementations of MediaRenderer-classes are presented. Visualisation of mediarelated data is strongly connected to MediaRenderer. MediaRenderer is to a large extent responsible for displaying visual panels created by other framework components. Finally, media object transport in VizIR is based on the Realtime Transfer Protocol (for media objects) and XML-messaging (for XML-data) ...|$|E
40|$|Image {{segmentation}} is {{a fundamental}} problem in computer vision. Despite many years of research, general purpose image segmentation {{is still a very}} challenging task because segmentation is inherently ill-posed. Among different segmentation schemes, graph theoretical ones have several good features in practical applications. It explicitly organizes the image elements into mathematically sound structures, and makes the formulation of the problem more flexible and the computation more efficient. In this paper, we conduct a systematic survey of graph theoretical methods for image segmentation, where the problem is modeled in terms of partitioning a graph into several sub-graphs such that each of them represents a meaningful object of interest in the image. These methods are categorized into five classes under a uniform notation: the minimal spanning tree based methods, graph cut based methods with cost functions, graph cut based methods on Markov random field models, the shortest path based methods and the other methods that do not belong to any of these classes. We present motivations and <b>detailed</b> <b>technical</b> <b>descriptions</b> for each category of methods. The quantitative evaluation is carried by using five indices - Probabilistic Rand (PR) index, Normalized Probabilistic Rand (NPR) index, Variation of Information (VI), Global Consistency Error (GCE) and Boundary Displacement Error (BDE) - on some representative automatic and interactive segmentation methods.

40|$|During {{the course}} of the study, the scope of the work broadened. This was in {{recognition}} {{of the fact that the}} Form 104 reporting procedure was just one part of the death registration and cause of death determination system. Interviews were carried out with representatives of the agencies involved in this system and a detailed description of the system is provided in Section II of the Technical Report. How the Form 104 reporting system performed in terms of forms being completed for all inquested deaths in 2002 is described in detail in Section III of the Technical Report. Section IV then describes the completeness of the data recorded on Form 104 and, where possible, how consistently these data matched other data collected by the death registration and cause of death determination system. These sections contain <b>detailed</b> <b>technical</b> <b>descriptions</b> which require careful interpretation. As mentioned above, the study focused on inquested deaths that occurred in 2002 and were registered in either 2002, 2003 or 2004.

This should be borne in mind when reading Sections II through IV of the Technical Report. The profile of individuals whose deaths result in inquest is unlikely to have changed significantly since 2002. Therefore, the findings from the analysis of the Form 104 data are likely to be valid for more recent years...|$|E
40|$|Despite the leaps in {{technology}} in warfare and modern weaponry, the human soldier {{remains the most}} important aspect of a competitive army. Military textile materials are an essential, yet often neglected, factor that protect the soldier and enable his or her actions in varying fields around the globe. The participation of most countries in larger military or peacekeeping organisations like the NATO and the UN involves the extension of the geographical areas of activity in environments varying greatly from the soldiers’ country of origin. Protection from the varying weather conditions and comfort are important factors for the optimal operational ability of a person in humanitarian actions or at combat field. Research in performance textiles has given rise to various forms of multilayered clothing and functional membranes with several commercial tradenames. These performance textiles aim at specialized sports and recreational activities as mountain climbing, hiking and cycling, among others. Additional advancements involve even more specialized function like the incorporation of microelectronics monitoring of vital signals of the human body or for the control of equipment. The incorporation of such technological advancements is a current challenge for the national and international military forces that inherit a set of strict procedures. These procedures involve standardization, <b>detailed</b> <b>technical</b> <b>descriptions,</b> cost and of course customs particular to each force.
