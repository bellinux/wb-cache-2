5|$|In most circumstances, {{in order}} to become law a bill must be first passed by both houses of the Diet and then {{promulgate}}d by the Emperor. This role of the Emperor is similar to the Royal Assent in some other nations; however, the Emperor cannot refuse to promulgate a law and therefore his legislative role <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> a formality.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aforesaid}} {{record of}} the military actions conducted in 1044, Ímar <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> named {{as the son of}} Aralt, a fact which could indicate that this was how he was known to his contemporaries.

5|$|My {{object in}} {{writing to you}} at present <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> to draw your {{attention}} to the subject, and to suggest a friendly conference {{to discuss the matter}} more fully. I would take it as a favour if you would kindly think the matter over, and make whatever suggestions you deem necessary.|$|E
5|$|Since {{an order}} for review of {{detention}} is a remedy for establishing the legality of detention, {{it may not be}} used to challenge the conditions under which a person is held, if the detention itself is lawful. Moreover, an order can only be sought where a person is being physically detained, and not if he or she <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> under some other form of restriction such as being out on bail.|$|E
60|$|The Phelpses came to Frankfort and we {{had some}} great times--dinner at his hotel, the Masons, supper at our inn--Livy not in it. She <b>was</b> <b>merely</b> allowed a glimpse, no more.

5|$|This <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> a {{heuristic}} characterization. The Dirac delta is not {{a function}} {{in the traditional sense}} as no function defined on the real numbers has these properties. The Dirac delta function can be rigorously defined either as a distribution or as a measure.|$|E
5|$|As {{intriguing}} as geometric Newtonian gravity may be, its basis, classical mechanics, <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> a {{limiting case}} of (special) relativistic mechanics. In {{the language of}} symmetry: where gravity can be neglected, physics is Lorentz invariant as in special relativity rather than Galilei invariant as in classical mechanics. (The defining symmetry of special relativity is the Poincaré group, which includes translations, rotations and boosts.) The {{differences between the two}} become significant when dealing with speeds approaching the speed of light, and with high-energy phenomena.|$|E
5|$|Chris tells Ann {{that after}} Indianapolis, {{he will be}} sent to a {{different}} city. The two agree they need to talk about the future of their relationship. Meanwhile, Andy's difficult day of running errands for April culminates with him getting arrested after April's sister Natalie (Minni Jo Mazzola) claims he is kidnapping her when he <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> picking her up from school. Ron approaches April and tells her that she should either forgive Andy or cut him loose, believing that she is only stringing Andy along and going to Indianapolis to spite him. When Andy returns, April finally forgives him and kisses him.|$|E

60|$|How to act, {{that was}} the {{question}}? Whither to go, how to become oneself? One was not oneself, one <b>was</b> <b>merely</b> a half-stated question. How to become oneself, how to know the question and the answer of oneself, when one <b>was</b> <b>merely</b> an unfixed something--nothing, blowing about like the winds of heaven, undefined, unstated.|$|R
5|$|Critics {{also note}} Flagg’s penchant for evil. Tony Magistrale, author of Stephen King: The Second Decade, Danse Macabre to The Dark Half sees Flagg as a Shakespearian villain {{comparing}} him to Iago, Edmund and Richard III, contending that Flagg is an antihero. Magistrale believes that Flagg’s evil {{is based on}} his ability to replace peace with conflict and unity with destruction; although he seeks power, it <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> a resource to achieve a greater level of destruction.|$|E
5|$|It is {{revealed}} {{that this man}} is the actual, corporeal Prismo, and the version Finn and Jake are familiar with <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> a dream. Prismo explains that killing a wishmaster—as in, waking up the man—is a cosmic crime, but that he will return when his corporal body falls back asleep. At that instant, the Lich springs into action, physically waking and destroying Prismo, killing him. Suddenly, an interdimensional being arrives and begins taking the Lich to the Citadel, to which Finn and Jake give chase.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Somairle's {{descendants}} in the decades following his demise. Dubgall does not appear on record until 1175, when he is attested far from the Isles in Durham, by the Durham Cathedral's Liber Vitae. Nothing is certain of Dubgall's later activities, {{and it is possible}} that, by the 1180s, Ragnall had begun to encroach upon Dubgall's territories and his position as head of the meic Somairle. The fact that Dubgall is not accorded any title by the Liber Vitae could be evidence that Ragnall had displaced him upon Somairle's demise, or that the chronicle's account of Dubgall's connection with the kingship <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> the work of thirteenth-century bias favouring the powerful meic Dubgaill, Dubgaill's descendants.|$|E

5|$|Many music {{industries}} {{around the}} globe are represented by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). The IFPI operates in 66 countries and services affiliated industry associations in 45 countries. In some cases, the IFPI <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> affiliated with the already operational certification bodies of a country, but in many others countries with lesser-developed industries, the IFPI acts as the sole certifying body servicing the country or region's music industry. Still other countries not represented by the IFPI have certifying bodies operating independently, such as individual record companies which service the country or region's music industry as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at The Forge, Captain Archer, Commander T'Pol, and T'Pau, {{having found}} the sacred Kir'Shara (which the Syrrannites believe will usher a Vulcan enlightenment), {{endeavor}} {{to take it}} to the capital. En route, T'Pol and T'Pau discuss the taboo of mind-melds, and T'Pau offers to mind-meld with T'Pol. She states the meld is safe when performed by those trained in the art, and that Pa'nar Syndrome <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> the by-product of an improperly conducted meld. The trio are then attacked by Major Talok and Vulcan commandos, and T'Pol is captured while the others escape. She tells her captors that they are headed to Mount Seleya in order to mislead them from their true destination.|$|E
5|$|Michael {{notes that}} he had gotten high at an Alicia Keys concert. During Michael's anti-drug meeting, he misidentifies hookah as an illegal drug; Toby points {{out the fact that}} it <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> a pipe. Dwight {{notes that he}}'ll have to bring in his bō staff, a long staff weapon used in Okinawa and feudal Japan, to protect the office. Jim later notes that Dwight was dressed like a member of the disco group the Village People.|$|E

5|$|One {{approach}} is to acknowledge that induction cannot achieve certainty, but observing more instances of a general statement can at least make the general statement more probable. So the chicken would be right to conclude from all those mornings that it is likely the farmer will come with food again the next morning, even if it cannot be certain. However, there remain difficult questions about what precise probability any given evidence justifies putting on the general statement. One way out of these particular difficulties is to declare that all beliefs about scientific theories are subjective, or personal, and correct reasoning <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> about how evidence should change one's subjective beliefs over time.|$|E
5|$|One {{objection}} is that two-level utilitarianism undermines an agent's {{commitment to}} act in accordance {{with his or her}} moral principles. For example, a theist will comply with his/her moral code because he/she sees it as based upon God's will. However, a two-level utilitarian knows that his everyday set of moral rules <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> a guideline, and as such any breach of these rules is unlikely to accompany the same degree of guilt as would someone who believed that it was wrong in principle {{to act in}} that way.|$|E
5|$|Skylark {{spends the}} day with Kim by playing basketball, hanging out and partying. Kim persuades Skylark that he is {{misunderstood}} as a cruel dictator and as a failed administrator, and they become friends. At dinner, Koh has a seizure due to the ricin poisoning and accidentally kills Yu before dying. The next morning, Skylark feels guilty and discards one of the ricin strips, then thwarts Rapaport's attempt to poison Kim with the second strip. After another dinner mourning the death of Kim's bodyguards, Skylark witnesses Kim's malicious side as he threatens war with South Korea. Skylark leaves, and after taking a walk, he discovers that a nearby grocery store <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> a façade and realizes that Kim has been lying to him.|$|E
