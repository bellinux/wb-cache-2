The concretions represent {{a high percentage of}} the dry weight of these organisms. In gill tissue, it can reach up to 50 % of dry weight prior to reproductive maturity. Analysis of elemental composition of the tissue concretions showed the presence of calcium and phosphate, as main components, associated with other residual elements like iron, manganese, magnesium, and zinc. Concretions are arranged in concentric alternated layers of organic and inorganic matrix. The shape and size of the concretions vary substantially, from very small, less than 1 µm diameter with very regular round structure, found mainly in the mantle tissue, to more than 50 µm length with irregular globular clusters, found predominantly in the gills. The microstructural organization is of a hydroxyapatite polymorphism in the mantle, in contrast to the gills, which exhibit irregular structure and carbonated hydroxyapatite polymorphism. These differences are supported by higher contents of dinitrogen pentoxide, magnesium, and iron in the mantle concretions, but higher contents of manganese and zinc in the gills.

Link, and Viva lactuca (L.). The techniques included both previously established ones and those which required development. The two main procedures developed for these algae were the neutral red retention technique (making use of a vital stain) and the ion leakage Health Index (based upon electrolyte leakage). Following optimisation both were used to produce quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) for a series of n-alcohols using log KOW as the physicochemical parameter. The resultant QSARs were statistically indistinguishable with line equations of - 0. 88 log KOW + 2. 87 and - 0. 95 log KOW + 2. 83 respectively, with r² values of 0. 98, suggesting that both reflect the same non-specific narcotic effect on membrane integrity. However the neutral red retention technique was less useful than the Health Index with low reproducibility and is therefore unsuitable for use as an <b>environmental</b> <b>biomonitor.</b> The effects of other compounds with specific modes of action were established using the ion leakage technique, the high toxicity of the antifouling compound tributyltin being reflected in the Health Index. Further development of the ion leakage technique involved inductively coupled - plasma mass spectrometry (ICP/MS) in the identification of ions lost during leakage. Synergistic toxicity was investigated exposing the algae to UV light and anthracene, simulating photo-induced toxicity. No photo-induced toxicity was observed although UV exposure did reduce the Health Index. An environmental assessment was carried out for algae from clean sites and organically and inorganically polluted sites, comparing the Health Index with other measures of health and bioaccumulation data. A long term study of a clean site showed the algal Health Index to be influenced by seasonally dependent physical parameters, but reflected reduced health in algae exposed environmentally to organic pollutants. Algae exposed to long term heavy metal pollution in the Fal Estuary had 'normal'. Health Indices, however chlorophyll fluorescence induction techniques did highlight a reduced photosynthetic efficiency in these algae. The ion leakage technique has potentially a wide application in field and laboratory based biomonitoring and direct toxicity studies. Chlorophyll fluorescence analysis was also shown to be useful although it requires further investigation and evaluation. Plymouth Marine Laboratories and Zeneca, Brixha...|$|R

Although historically oestrogen has been related to development of reproductive system, research over the last decade has confirmed its crucial role in the development and homeostasis of other organ systems. As a number of anthropogenic agents are xenoestrogens, environmental health research has focused on oestrogen receptor level disturbances and of aromatase polymorphisms. Oestrogen and xenoestrogens mediate critical points in carcinogenesis by binding to oestrogen receptors, whose distribution is age-, gender-, and tissue-specific. This review brings data about cancer types whose eatiology may be found in environmental exposure to xenoestrogens. Cancer types that have been well documented in literature to be related with environmental exposure include the reproductive system, breast, lung, kidney, pancreas, and brain. The results of our data mining show (a) a significant correlation between exposure to xenoestrogens and increased, gender-related, cancer risk and (b) a need to re-evaluate agents so far defined as endocrine disruptors, as they are also key molecules in carcinogenesis.

Of all ecosystems, anthropogenically important estuaries represent a â��melting potâ�� of environmental stressors, typified by extreme salinity variations and associated biological complexity. Although existing models attempt to predict macroorganismal diversity over estuarine salinity gradients, attempts to model microbial biodiversity are limited for eukaryotes. Although diatoms commonly feature as bioindicator species, additional microbial eukaryotes represent a huge resource for assessing ecosystem health. Of these, meiofaunal communities may represent the optimal compromise between functional diversity that can be assessed using morphology and phenotypeâ��environment interactions as compared with smaller life fractions. Here, using 454 Roche sequencing of the 18 S nSSU barcode we investigate which of the local natural drivers are most strongly associated with microbial metazoan and sampled protist diversity across the full salinity gradient of the estuarine ecosystem. In order to investigate potential variation at the ecosystem scale, we compare two geographically proximate estuaries (Thames and Mersey, UK) with contrasting histories of anthropogenic stress. The data show that although community turnover is likely to be predictable, taxa are likely to respond to different environmental drivers and, in particular, hydrodynamics, salinity range and granulometry, according to varied life-history characteristics.
