5|$|Due to {{this shift}} in thought about the {{underlying}} mechanisms in plantar fasciitis, many <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> community have stated the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis.

5|$|In astrophysical plasmas, Debye {{screening}} prevents electric fields from directly {{affecting the}} plasma over large distances, i.e., {{greater than the}} Debye length. However, the existence of charged particles causes the plasma to generate, and be affected by, magnetic fields. This can and does cause extremely complex behavior, such as the generation of plasma double layers, an object that separates charge over a few tens of Debye lengths. The dynamics of plasmas interacting with external and self-generated magnetic fields are studied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> discipline of magnetohydrodynamics.|$|E

5|$|Integrated {{education}} {{models are}} emerging <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> world, a model which {{is referred to}} as T-shape and π-shaped education. T-shaped professionals are taught general knowledge in a few disciplines (e.g. management and engineering) and specific, deep knowledge in a single domain (e.g. design). This model also applies to companies, when they shift their focus from small T innovations (innovations involving only one discipline, like chemists) to big T innovations (innovations involving several disciplines, like design, ethnography, lead user, etc.). Like in education, this shift makes breaking down silos of departments and disciplines of knowledge essential.|$|E

5|$|The Naval Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (NJROTC) is {{a program}} {{allowing}} {{high school students to}} participate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> and physical training aspect of naval service, while also providing leadership opportunities to those involved in the program.

The company of cadets are overseen and instructed by two retired United States Navy personnel, who are in turn overseen by the United States Navy itself through the form of Area Managers. Port Charlotte's unit is a member of NJROTC Area Seven, and is known for service to its community.|$|E

5|$|The Romanian Revolution of 1989 {{resulted}} in more consideration being granted to I. C. Filitti, as both researcher and polemicist. The Filitti Archive, preserved by Manole Filitti, was divided into separate funds, and divided between several institutions: the Romanian Academy Library, the National Archives, the Cotroceni Palace collection, and the Ialomița County Museum. Selections from the historian's diaries were published by Georgeta Filitti as fascicles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> review Revista Istorică, during the early 1990s.

5|$|For {{the first}} time in the history of UST, the Faculty of Pharmacy opened its doors to women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> year 1924–1925. It was one of the first {{universities}} in the Philippines to become co-educational when it admitted women. There were 24 women enrollees out of the 93 who matriculated for the said Faculty that school year. The University, however, had been granting certificates through the School of Midwifery since 1879. Permission was given to the College of Education in 1926, to Faculty of Philosophy and Letters in 1927 followed by the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery and College of Commerce in 1932. The admission of women no longer became an issue in later years. Only the Faculties of Sacred Theology, Canon Law, and Philosophy remained exclusively for men.|$|E
5|$|Patton {{continued}} playing polo and sailing in this time. After sailing back to Los Angeles {{for extended}} leave in 1937, he was kicked by {{a horse and}} fractured his leg. Patton developed phlebitis from the injury, which nearly killed him. The incident almost forced Patton out of active service, but a six-month administrative assignment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Academic</b> Department at the Cavalry School at Fort Riley helped him to recover. Patton was promoted to colonel on July 24, 1938 and given command of the 5th Cavalry at Fort Clark, Texas, for six months, a post he relished, but he was reassigned to Fort Myer again in December as commander of the 3rd Cavalry. There, he met Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall, who {{was so impressed with}} him that Marshall considered Patton a prime candidate for promotion to general. In peacetime, though, he would remain a colonel to remain eligible to command a regiment.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} currently houses 11,000 beds on-campus {{in eight}} different housing communities. Residence hall style suites {{are available in}} the Libra, Apollo, Hercules, Nike, and Neptune communities. All of the residence hall suites have bathrooms shared between 2 or 3 rooms as opposed to communal bathrooms. Apartment-style housing is available <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Academic</b> Village (Nike and Hercules) communities, the Towers at Knights Plaza, the Lake Claire Courtyard Apartments Community, and NorthView. UCF also has 400 beds at the Rosen College Apartments Community, located on the Rosen College of Hospitality Management campus. The majority of all on campus housing is occupied by freshman, though The Towers at Knights Plaza house mainly upper-classmen, student athletes, and honors students. Residents of the Towers Communities and Rosen College Apartments sign annual contracts to rent their apartments for a full academic year (fall, spring, and summer), whereas residents of all other standard housing communities on the main campus sign academic contracts to rent their rooms only for one or two semesters at a time. Housing on the main campus typically fills to capacity well {{before the start of the}} Fall semester, and cannot accommodate everyone who applies.|$|E
