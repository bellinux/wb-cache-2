In short, the emulsification of the cubic lipid phases in water results in production of cubosomes that {{can be defined as}} nanoparticulate dispersal systems characterized by high biocompatibility and bioadhesivity. They are formed by the mixture of phospholipid (<b>glycerol</b> <b>monooleate)</b> and non-ionic surfactant in aqueous media by applying high energy dispersion such as sonication and homogenization. Nano-vehicles are generated from a self-assembled lipid mixture and studied by means of high-resolution cryogenic transmission electron microscope (cryo-TEM). These structures have been observed to naturally occur in mitochondrial membranes and in stressed cells.|$|E

Many aspects of organic friction modifier behaviour remain unknown. In this thesis these aspects are isolated and probed using numerous different techniques. Organic friction modifiers are amphiphilic molecules comprising a head group and a hydrocarbon chain. The chemistry of the organic friction modifier employed affects the observed film forming properties and frictional behaviour. Factors of interest include {{the effects of the}} head group type and of alkyl chain unsaturation. Commercially employed organic friction modifiers tend to comprise a mono-unsaturated oleyl group. This project deals with the impact this has on organic friction modifier performance. Another area of interest is the behaviour of <b>glycerol</b> <b>monooleate.</b> <b>Glycerol</b> <b>monooleate</b> {{is one of the most}} commercially employed organic friction modifiers and is atypical to model organic friction modifiers in that it has a rather bulky polar moiety. Model organic friction modifiers usually have only one functional group; however, <b>glycerol</b> <b>monooleate</b> has two alcohol groups and an ester group. Although <b>glycerol</b> <b>monooleate</b> is widely employed in oil formulations, many aspects of its behaviour remain uncertain. In this thesis several techniques are used including upscale friction experiments such as High Frequency Reciprocating Rig tests, Ball on Disc pure sliding friction tests and Mini-Traction Machine mixed sliding-rolling tests. Organic friction modifier film formation on ferrous and non-ferrous surfaces is investigated in situ from solution in hydrocarbon solvent using the Atomic Force Microscope. Organic friction modifier films formed on surfaces during friction tests are investigated ex situ by Atomic Force Microscopy and Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy.

Here, we present the phase behavior of phytantriol in water, as determined by X-ray diffraction. At room temperature, the phase sequence upon increasing the water concentration is reversed micellar, lamellar, cubic phase Q(230), and cubic phase Q(224). At 44 degreesC, the cubic liquid crystals are transformed into a reversed hexagonal phase. The temperature-composition phase diagram of phytantriol/water mixtures is, thus, qualitatively similar to that of aqueous <b>glycerol</b> <b>monooleate.</b> The chemical stability of phytantriol makes it an interesting alternative to <b>glycerol</b> <b>monooleate</b> in exploiting various scientific and technical applications of, in particular, the cubic liquid crystalline phases...|$|E

Surprisingly, {{the literature on the}} in vitro and in vivo toxicity of cubic and hexagonal phase forming lipid nanoparticles is negligible, despite a rapidly growing number of publications on their potential use in various therapeutic applications. In this work we have developed methods to study the in vitro cytotoxicity of two chemically distinct cubic phase nanoparticle dispersions using the lipids <b>glycerol</b> <b>monooleate</b> and phytantriol respectively. We have found that the toxicity of phytantriol cubosomes is considerably greater than that of <b>glycerol</b> <b>monooleate</b> cubosomes. The increased toxicity of phytantriol appears to result from its greater ability to disrupt the cellular membrane (haemolytic activity) and oxidative stress.

In this work, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) investigation is performed on the 'melting' transition of the bicontinuous double diamond cubic phase, formed by pure <b>glycerol</b> <b>monooleate</b> (MO), upon progressive inclusion of varying fractions of pharmaceutical-grade <b>glycerol</b> <b>monooleate</b> (GO) in the hydrated system. The self-assembled MO/GO mixtures are found to form diamond (Pn 3 m) inverted cubic, inverted hexagonal (H(II)), and sponge (L(3)) phases at ambient temperature in excess of aqueous medium without heat treatment. Mixing of the inverted-cubic-phase-forming MO and the sponge-phase-forming GO components, in equivalent proportions (50 / 50 w/w), yields an inverted hexagonal (H(II)) phase nanostructured carrier. Scattering models are applied for fitting of the experimental SAXS patterns and identification of the structural changes in the aqueous and lipid bilayer subcompartments.

Neutron reflectivity measurements on the interaction of CPNPs with bilayers of different coverage have increased our understanding of an interfacial exchange mechanism that is relevant to delivery applications. To access {{the composition of the}} adsorption layer, the method of isotopic contrast between the components was exploited by using DOPC with perdeuterated acyl chains, which are distinguishable (high scattering contrast) from the hydrogenous components of the CPNPs. The exchange of material between CPNPs and the bilayer takes place regardless of the initial bilayer coverage. However, this parameter has a strong influence on the physical nature of the layer formed upon interaction. For a bilayer of "high coverage" (80 %), extensive exchange takes place between the CPNP components and the bilayer, and at steady state the surface layer comprises 72 % <b>glycerol</b> <b>monooleate</b> and 8 % DOPC, with no change in the solvent content. An analogous experiment involving pure <b>glycerol</b> <b>monooleate</b> liquid crystals shows that lipid exchange occurs {{even in the absence of}} the stabilizing polymer. For bilayers of "low coverage" (55 %), the exchange mechanism involves an initial adsorption of material from the CPNPs to fill in the bilayer defects. However, most of the bilayer breaks up and only 15 % coverage remains after 30 h. The evolution of a Bragg diffraction peak was monitored in this case to show that the bound nanoparticles occupy > 7 % surface coverage and have a periodicity in the density of the internal lipid structure that decreases with time. This progression is attributed to the incorporation of d-DOPC molecules within the internal cubic structure of the nanoparticles. The broadening of the diffraction peak with time, together with a final mean position that is closely related to the periodicity of the lamellar phase organization of GMO, shows that the lipid-exchange process results in either a contraction of the unit cell of the cubic-phase nanoparticles or a progression of the lipid arrangement to the lamellar phase...|$|E

For the first time the tension and viscosity of solvent-free bilayers have been observed to display a frequency dependence. The variations of both parameters can be accounted for by a Maxwell viscoelastic fluid model having a relaxation time of 37 microseconds. The equilibrium (omega = 0) tension is compatible with literature values. The present results do not suffice to precisely define the specific molecular processes involved, but relaxation times similar to the present are associated with certain phenomena in phospholipid vesicles. Bilayers containing hydrocarbon solvent do not show such relaxation, presumably due to their weaker intermolecular interactions...|$|E
40|$|Tribochemical {{reactions}} {{occurring at}} carbon surfaces {{have a strong}} influence on the friction and wear properties of diamond and diamond-like carbon (DLC) surfaces [1]. Molecules that are in contact with a surface can undergo dissociative chemisorption before or during tribological load and passivate dangling bonds. This prevents the formation of strong covalent bonds between sliding surfaces, resulting in a lower friction coefficient. Furthermore, molecules can physisorb at passivated carbon surfaces by means of hydrogen bonds and van-der-Waals interactions. This {{can lead to the}} formation of adsorbed layers that in turn modify the friction properties of the surface. These mechanisms are believed to {{play a crucial role in}} the superlubricity that tetrahedral-amorphous carbon (ta-C) surfaces exhibit when in contact with certain OH-containing molecules (e. g.

All systems showed a microemulsion region at high oil content and a large area of coexistence of two liquid crystalline (hexagonal and lamellar) phases. 1 H and 13 C NMR self-diffusion measurements were used to characterize microstructural features of the microemulsions. On water dilution, the two-phase liquid crystalline region transforms into a creamy emulsion area where the droplets of water are stabilized by both the lamellar and the hexagonal phases, as indicated by 2 H NMR measurements. Due to the very effective dispersing action of the two liquid crystalline phases, these emulsions show a high stability toward phase separation...|$|E

Monolayers formed at temperatures above and below the transition behaved differently. For a monolayer fully compressed in the low temperature state, the transitional changes were small (fluctuations ∼ 8. 4 % of). For a film fully compressed at temperatures above the lipid transition the changes were much larger (fluctuations up to 95 % of). The temperature variations also were somewhat different, although in both cases the transitions occurred between about 15. 3 and 16. 5 °C. The molecular bases of the differences are discussed.

Changes in the tension of GMO/n-decane membranes induced by altering the composition of the parent solution were detected and quantified. In a test of the reliability of the technique controlled variations of the viscosity of the aqueous bathing solution were accurately monitored. The technique was applied to solvent-free bilayers formed from dispersions of GMO in squalane. The lower tensions observed attested to the comparative absence of solvent in such bilayers.

40|$|Lipids and lipopolymers self-assembled into {{biocompatible}} nano- and mesostructured functional materials offer {{many potential}} applications {{in medicine and}} diagnostics. In this Account, we demonstrate how high-resolution structural investigations of bicontinuous cubic templates made from lyotropic thermosensitive liquid-crystalline (LC) materials have initiated the development of innovative lipidopolymeric self-assembled nanocarriers. Such structures have tunable nanochannel sizes, morphologies, and hierarchical inner organizations and provide potential vehicles for the predictable loading and release of therapeutic proteins, peptides, or nucleic acids. This Account shows that structural studies of swelling of bicontinuous cubic lipid/water phases are essential for overcoming the nanoscale constraints for encapsulation of large therapeutic molecules in multicompartment lipid carriers. For the systems described here, we have employed time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and high-resolution freeze-fracture electronic microscopy (FF-EM) to study the morphology and the dynamic topological transitions of these nanostructured multicomponent amphiphilic assemblies. Quasi-elastic light scattering and circular dichroism spectroscopy can provide additional information at the nanoscale about the behavior of lipid/protein self-assemblies under conditions that approximate physiological hydration. We wanted to generalize these findings to control the stability and the hydration of the water nanochannels in liquid-crystalline lipid nanovehicles and confine therapeutic biomolecules within these structures. Therefore we analyzed the influence of amphiphilic and soluble additives (e. g. poly(ethylene glycol) monooleate (MO-PEG), octyl glucoside (OG), proteins) on the nanochannels' size in a diamond (D) -type bicontinuous cubic phase of the lipid <b>glycerol</b> <b>monooleate</b> (MO). At body temperature, we can stabilize long-living swollen states, corresponding to a diamond cubic phase with large water channels. Time-resolved X-ray diffraction (XRD) scans allowed us to detect metastable intermediate and coexisting structures and monitor the temperature-induced phase sequences of mixed systems containing <b>glycerol</b> <b>monooleate,</b> a soluble protein macromolecule, and an interfacial curvature modulating agent. These observed states correspond to the stages {{of the growth of}} the nanofluidic channel network. With the application of a thermal stimulus, the system becomes progressively more ordered into a double-diamond cubic lattice formed by a bicontinuous lipid membrane. High-resolution freeze-fracture electronic microscopy indicates that nanodomains are induced by the inclusion of proteins into nanopockets of the supramolecular cubosomic assemblies. These results contribute {{to the understanding of the}} structure and dynamics of functionalized self-assembled lipid nanosystems during stimuli-triggered LC phase transformations...|$|E

The initial Q(II) (D) phase is prepared {{in the form of}} a film coating the inside of a capillary, deposited under flow, which produces a sample uniaxially oriented with a axis parallel to the symmetry axis of the sample. A transformation is induced by replacing the water within the capillary tube with a solution of poly(ethylene glycol), which draws water out of the Q(II) (D) sample by osmotic stress. This converts the Q(II) (D) phase into a Q(II) (G) phase with two coexisting orientations, with the and axes parallel to the symmetry axis, as demonstrated by small-angle X-ray scattering. The process can then be reversed, to recover the initial orientation of Q(II) (D) phase. The epitaxial relation between the two oriented mesophases is consistent with topology-preserving geometric pathways that have previously been hypothesized for the transformation. Furthermore, this has implications for the production of macroscopically oriented Q(II) (G) phases, in particular with applications as nanomaterial templates...|$|E

The most stable emulsion was achieved with a combination of hydrophilic (untreated) and hydrophobic MFC and only minute amounts of the stabilizer gave a pronounced effect. Even with the optimized formulation the lifetime of the emulsion was shorter than previously reported when a conventional polymeric stabilizer was used, however. The water drop sizes in the emulsions were determined by three methods: optical images, light scattering, and NMR diffusometry. All three methods gave water drops sizes of ca 2 μm. The NMR diffusometry indicated that besides the micrometer-sized emulsion drops a significant fraction of the water is present in small droplets of micelle size.

40|$|The {{swelling}} of sponge-like bicontinuous mesophases of bilayers of surfactant (or lipid) in {{water as a}} function of dilution is analyzed. Analytic formulae for the swelling are derived assuming (i) constant aggregate thickness and (ii) fixed surface area per surfactant molecule at an imaginary surface located within the bilayer. Approximate swelling laws are derived for bicontinuous films and compared with swelling behaviour of disconnected sheet-like, rod-like and globular aggregates. It is shown that sponge-like “oil-in-water” bicontinuous aggregates can be readily distinguished from rods, sheets or globules in surfactant/lipid aggregates; the morphologies of aggregates of reversed curvature (“water-in-oil”) are less easily deduced from swelling data. Accurate scaling laws for (ordered or disordered) symmetric and asymmetric sponges, sheets, rods and globules are compared with experimental data of bicontinuous cubic phases in the binary <b>glycerol</b> <b>monooleate</b> - water system and the pseudo-binary didodecyl dimethyl ammonium bromide - cyclohexane - water system as well as some data within dilute sponge-like phases.

Three types of cubic phase gels were designed based on the ternary phase diagram of the MO–PG–water system, and their internal structures were confirmed by polarizing light microscopy (PLM) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Release results showed the cubic phase gels could provide a sustained system for capsaicin, while the initial water content in the gels was the major factor affecting the release rate. Release kinetics was determined to fit Higuchi’s square-root equation indicating that the release was under diffusion control. The calculated diffusion exponent showed the release from cubic phase gels was anomalous transport. The unique structure of the cubic phases, capsaicin distributed in the lipid bilayers, and cubic phase gel swelling contributed to the release mechanism. The cubic phase gel may be an interesting application for transdermal delivery system of capsaicin in alleviating the post-incision pain...|$|E

In order to fully understand the biological implications {{as well as to}} reveal the full potential for applications, e. g. for drug delivery and other biomedical devices, of such structures, well-defined model systems are required. Here, we discuss the formation of lipid nonlamellar liquid crystalline (LC) surface layers spin-coated from the constituting lipids followed by hydration of the lipid layer. We demonstrate that hybrid lipid polymer films can be formed with different properties compared with the neat lipid LC layers.

Most notably, mixed lipid layers, which are composed of <b>glycerol</b> <b>monooleate</b> and diglycerol monooleate with poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) nanogels, can form films of reverse cubic phases that are capable of responding to temperature stimulus.

Ultra-low friction (µ < 0. 04) was confirmed with glycerol and GMO. At the same time, very high wear of the superhard ta-C coating {{was found for}} GMO solely. A systematic study of lubricant chemistry, surface impurities, testing temperature, counter body material, and the carbon coating regarding sp 3 -fraction and crystallinity was conducted, indicating a strong difference between low abrasion wear and high chemical wear. Based on the measured data, the chemical nature and wear promoting factors are considered, suggesting detrimental interaction of amorphous sp 3 -carbon in the coating and unsaturated carbon bonds in the lubricant. Furthermore, a relation for low friction of GMO and contact pressure was established, leading to lowest friction for contact pressure below 600 MPa. High wear on either component of the ball-on-plate-geometry of the test setup led to a change of the contact area, thus strongly influencing frictional behavior of the tribometer model test...|$|E

It was found that the most chaotropic derivative of diclofenac diethyl amine (DEA-DFC) interacted with the polar heads of <b>glycerol</b> <b>monooleate</b> (GMO), thus expanding the water-lipid interface of the lamellar and cubic mesophases. This effect was detected by an increase in the lattice parameter of both mesophases, enhanced elastic properties, and increased solid-like response of the systems in the presence of DEA. Potassium diclofenac (K-DFC), a less chaotropic salt, had less pronounced effect on the structural features of the mesophases. Kosmotropic Na+ salt (Na-DFC) had only minor influence on both lamellar and cubic structures. The locus of solubilization of the molecules with the host mesophases was correlated with their delivery. It was suggested that transdermal delivery of kosmotropic Na-DFC was accelerated by the aqueous phase and less constrained by the interaction with monoglyceride. On the other hand, the chaotropic cations (K+ and DEA+), presumably entrapped in the water-lipid interface, interacted with monoglyceride headgroups, which {{is likely to be the}} key cause for their sustained administration...|$|E

The surface binding process occurs with no lateral ordering. There is no indication of collapse and spreading of the particles {{over a period of several}} hours. Even over much longer time scales (> 45 h), there is no sign of relaxation or transition of the cubic phase internal structure of the adsorbed nanoparticles. Measurements of the adsorption kinetics with respect to three physical parameters allow us to propose an interaction mechanism where residual free polymer molecules present in the nanoparticle dispersions adsorb rapidly to the surface, and the nanoparticles adsorb more slowly in the gaps.

It could be interesting to develop a sustained-release formulation that could be effective on both pain/inflammation and restoration of mechanical integrity of the joint. Recently, an injectable system based on <b>glycerol</b> <b>monooleate</b> (GMO), containing clonidine as a model hydrophilic analgesic/anti-inflammatory drug and hyaluronic acid as a viscoelastic scaffold, showed promising potential as a biodegradable and biocompatible preparation to sustain the drug activity. However, drug release from the system is relatively fast (complete within 1 week) and the underlying drug release mechanisms not fully understood.

This current is consistent with anions moving through the membrane to the rear side. The peak current is independent of holding potential. PLA 2 activity on phospholipid membranes not only produced a current but also led to membrane rupture within 300 s. The current depends on Ca 2 + and lipid type. Addition of PLA 2 {{in the absence of}} Ca 2 + or to membranes made of nonsubstrate lipids (e. g., <b>glycerol</b> <b>monooleate</b> or lysophosphatidylcholine) produced no current and did not break the bilayer. Peak current height, signal decay time, and time to membrane rupture all depended on PLA 2 dose, whereas total charge produced was constant. This current does not flow through ion channels because there are no channels present and the current is not voltage dependent. The evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that the current is generated by the movement of ionized fatty acid produced by PLA 2 action.

In addition, the biocompatibility and effectiveness of two selected gel candidates were evaluated in vivo by evaluating {{the benefit of a}} single intraarticular injection of these new treatments in a model of osteoarthritis in rabbits. The in vitro study demonstrated that the carrier F 1 did not have a pro-oxidative effect and even protected PMNs against natural auto-activation, regardless of the incorporation of either clonidine chlorhydrate or betamethasone dipropionate. The in vivo study demonstrated that F 1 and F 1 -BDP induced a loss of cartilage quality in comparison to the control and reference groups but that the lesions of cartilage observed were generally mild, with not much full-depth erosion. Moreover, no exacerbating inflammation was observed when considering the synovial membranes and the PGE 2 and CRP levels. These results seemed to demonstrate that the sustained-release formulation based on GMO could be well-tolerated after intraarticular injection. Moreover, it could have the potential to prevent inflammatory conditions while sustaining drug activity locally over weeks. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Cubosome {{particles}} {{were produced}} by fragmenting a cubic crystalline phase of <b>glycerol</b> <b>monooleate</b> {{and water in}} the presence of a stabilizing poly(ethylene oxide) -based polymer. The aim of our investigation was to study the interaction between these particles and mucin to gain information on how they would perform as a vehicle for mucosal drug delivery. Particle electrophoresis was used to investigate the interactions between particles and mucin in solution, and ellipsometry was utilized to study the interactions between particles and mucin-coated silica surfaces. The interaction studies were performed at relevant physiological conditions, and the pH and ionic strength were varied to gain more information about the driving forces for the interaction. The results from electrophoretic measurements showed that mucin in solution adsorbed to the particles at pH 4, whereas at pH 6 no clear interaction was detected. From ellipsometric measurements it was evident that the particles adsorb reversibly to a mucin-coated silica surface at pH 4, while no adsorption of particles could be detected at pH 6. The overall conclusion is that the interaction between these particles and mucin is weak and pH-dependent. These findings are in agreement with other investigations of the interactions between mucin and poly(ethylene oxide) chains...|$|E

40|$|To {{generate}} nanostructured {{vehicles with}} tunable internal organization, the structural phase {{behavior of a}} self-assembled amphiphilic mixture involving poly(ethylene glycol) monooleate (MO-PEG) and <b>glycerol</b> <b>monooleate</b> (MO) is studied in excess aqueous medium by time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) in the temperature range from 1 to 68 degrees C. The SAXS data indicate miscibility of the two components in lamellar and nonlamellar soft-matter nanostructures. The functionalization of the MO assemblies by a MO-PEG amphiphile, which has a flexible large hydrophilic moiety, appears to hinder the epitaxial growth of a double diamond (D) cubic lattice from the lamellar (L) bilayer structure during the thermal phase transition. The incorporated MO-PEG additive is found to facilitate the formation of structural intermediates. They exhibit greater characteristic spacings and large diffusive scattering in broad temperature and time intervals. Their features are {{compared with those of}} swollen long-living intermediates in MO/octylglucoside assemblies. A conclusion can be drawn that long-living intermediate states can be equilibrium stabilized in two- or multicomponent amphiphilic systems. Their role as cubic phase precursors is to smooth the structural distortions arising from curvature mismatch between flat and curved regions. The considered MO-PEG functionalized assemblies may be useful for preparation of sterically stabilized liquid-crystalline nanovehicles for confinement of therapeutic biomolecules...|$|E
40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{behavior of}} self-assembled lipid liquid crystalline nanoparticles at different model surfaces {{was investigated in}} situ by use of ellipsometry. The technique allows time-resolved monitoring of the adsorbed amount and layer thickness under transient and steady-state conditions. The system under study was cubic-phase nanoparticle (CPNP) dispersions of <b>glycerol</b> <b>monooleate</b> stabilized by a nonionic block copolymer, Pluronic F- 127. Depending on the surface properties and presence of electrolytes, different adsorption scenarios were discerned: At hydrophilic silica thick surface layers of CPNPs are generated by particle adsorption from dispersions containing added electrolyte, but no adsorption is observed in pure water. Adsorption at the hydrophobic surface involves extensive structural relaxation and formation, which is not electrolyte sensitive, of a classic monolayer structure. The different observations are rationalized in terms of differences in interactions among the CPNP aggregates, their unimer constituents, and the surface and show a strong influence of interfacial interactions on structure formation. Surface self-assembly structures with properties {{similar to those of}} the corresponding bulk aggregates appear exclusively in the weak interaction limit. This observation is in agreement with observations for surfactant self-assembly systems, and our findings indicate that this behavior is applicable also to complex self-assembly structures such as the CPNP structures discussed herein...|$|E
40|$|Temperature-dependent {{structural}} changes in planar bilayer membranes formed from <b>glycerol</b> <b>monooleate</b> (GMO) dispersed in various n-alkane solvents (C 12 -C 17) {{have been studied}} using precise measurements of specific geometric capacitance (Cg). Cg generally increases as temperature (T) decreases. A change in the slope of Cg(T) occurs between 15 and 18 degrees C for all solvent systems examined. Measurements of the interfacial tension (gamma) of the bulk GMO-alkane dispersions against 0. 1 M NaCl show that gamma generally decreases with decreasing temperature. The data can be fitted with two straight lines of different slope which intersect on the average at 17 degrees C. Pagano et al. (1973, Science (Wash. D. C.). 181 : 557) have shown using calorimetry that GMO has a phase transition at about 15 degrees C. Thus, the changes in Cg and gamma with temperature are likely to result from a GMO phase transition. A second structural change is observed to occur between 5 and 10 degrees C {{which has not been}} detected calorimetrically. Calculations of Cg based on various estimates of the hydrocarbon dielectric coefficient (epsilon-b) and/or hydrocarbon thickness (delta-b) leads to models for the structure of the bilayer above and below the phase transition temperature...|$|E
