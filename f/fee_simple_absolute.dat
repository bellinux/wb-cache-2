For example, if X and Y create a joint tenancy, both X and Y's interests must be in <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>absolute.</b> If, for example, X has a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>absolute</b> and Y has a life estate, there is no unity of interest.|$|E

40|$|The {{public trust}} {{doctrine}} is often accused of undermining property rights, when in fact the doctrine is actually a property concept, and a venerable one. Instead of threatening property rights, the doctrine functions to harmonize public and private rights in important resources, mostly those close to the land-water edge. This article demonstrates how this reconciliation takes place by examining case law recognizing the lineal and conceptual divisions by which the doctrine separates public and private rights. It also considers other {{ways in which the}} {{public trust doctrine}} balances public and private rights, such as ratifying small privatizations of public resources, transforming <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>absolutes</b> into defeasible <b>fees,</b> and recognizing pubic easements on private land titles. The article concludes that the public trust doctrine, if properly understood, can perform the important function helping to modernize property law...|$|R
5000|$|Some scholars, such as John V. Orth, {{believe that}} this {{explanation}} (to promote the right to transfer the land) {{of the origin of}} the Rule is inaccurate. In their view the Rule originated as the courts' response to an estate-planning technique in the 14th century, long before the litigation in Shelley's Case. A tax known as the [...] "relief" [...] had to be paid to the feudal lord (the Crown) when a tenant's heir inherited the land. To avoid this estate tax, if the grant to the land were framed in term of a life estate in the grantee followed by a remainder in the grantee's heirs, then upon the grantee's death his heirs would not inherit the land, but received it as a vested remainder. As a consequence, the heir would take the land without having to pay the relief. The courts could not abide such a transparent attempt to circumvent the tax system, and the Rule was invented to deal with this problem by converting these transfers into <b>fees</b> <b>simple</b> <b>absolute</b> so as to allow the relief to be collected upon the grantee's death. Later, when the relief was abolished, the Rule continued to survive in the common law due to inertia ("it is the genius of the common law to add, but not to subtract"), the [...] "promote the right to transfer the land" [...] explanation was concocted to explain the continued existence of the Rule. Note that {{it is not at all}} uncommon for rules of common law, once their original motivation falls away, to acquire a new justification, and in the process also, sometimes, a new meaning. Many examples of such processes are given in Oliver Wendell Holmes's The Common Law.|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} demand {{for oil and gas}} places a burden on lands set aside for natural resource conservation. Oil and gas development alters the environment locally and on a much broader spatial scale depending on the intensity and extent of mineral resource extraction. The current increase in oil and gas exploration and production in the United States prompted an update of the number of pipelines and wells associated with oil and gas production on National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) lands. We obtained geospatial data on the location of oil and gas wells and pipelines within and close to the boundaries of NWRS lands (units) acquired as <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> (i. e. <b>absolute</b> title to the surface land) by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. We found that 5, 002 wells are located in 107 NWRS units and 595 pipelines transect 149 of the 599 NWRS units. Almost half of the wells (2, 196) were inactive, one-third (1, 665) were active, and the remainder of the wells were either plugged and abandoned or the status was unknown. Pipelines crossed a total of 2, 155 kilometers (1, 339 miles) of NWRS <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> lands. The high level of oil and gas activity warrants follow up assessments for wells lacking information on production type or well status with emphasis on verifying the well status and identifying abandoned and unplugged wells. NWRS <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> lands should also be assessed for impacts from brine, oil and other hydrocarbon spills, as well as habitat alteration associated with oil and gas, including the identification of abandoned oil and gas facilities requiring equipment removal and site restoration...|$|R
5000|$|A {{fee simple}} {{subject to a}} {{condition}} subsequent is created when {{the words of a}} grant support the conclusion that the grantor intends to convey a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>absolute</b> but has attached a condition to the grant so that if a specified future event happens the grantor will get its <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>absolute</b> back, provided that the grantor exercises his right of entry (or power of termination). Thus, a fee simple subject to condition subsequent does not end automatically upon the happening of the condition. The future interest is called a [...] "right of reentry" [...] or [...] "right of entry," [...] and the property only reverts to the original grantor if he exercises this right.|$|E
50|$|The Rule's effect ended there. After that, the {{doctrine}} of merger operated on the two successive freehold estates placed in the same purchaser (B's life estate and B's remainder in fee simple) and converted them into a single <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>absolute</b> in B.|$|E
50|$|Also certain {{procedures}} must be followed. Once {{these procedures}} are followed, on a sale by the tenant for life the purchaser receives the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>absolute</b> {{in the land}} freed from all the interests attaching to it under the settlement. The interests under the settlement are over-reached i.e. shifted to the proceeds of sale.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> determinable is {{an estate}} that will end {{automatically}} when the stated event or condition occurs. The interest will {{revert to the}} grantor or the heirs of the grantor. Normally, a possibility of reverter follows a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> determinable. However a possibility of reverter does not follow a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> determinable subject to an executory interest. Durational language such as [...] "to A {{as long as the}} property is used for a park" [...] creates a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> determinable and a possibility of reverter.|$|R
40|$|Prominent {{economically}} oriented legal academics {{are currently}} {{arguing that the}} <b>fee</b> <b>simple,</b> the dominant form of private landownership in the United States, is an inefficient way for society to allocate land. They maintain that the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> blocks transfers of land to higher value uses because it provides property owners with a perpetual monopoly. The critics propose that landownership be reformulated to enable private actors to forcibly purchase land from other private owners, {{similar to the way}} that governments can expropriate land for public uses using eminent domain. While recognizing the significance of the critique, this Article takes issue with it and defends the <b>fee</b> <b>simple.</b> The Article makes two main points in defense of the <b>fee</b> <b>simple.</b> First, addressing the critique on its own economic terms, the Article argues that the critics have not established that there is a robust economic argument for dispensing with the <b>fee</b> <b>simple.</b> The critique that the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> leads to the misallocation of land rests on three empirical premises for which the critics have yet to provide much evidence. The critique also downplays or overlooks important economic benefits of the <b>fee</b> <b>simple.</b> Second, departing from the economic discourse of the critics, the Article argues that the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> is valuable because it gives landowners a perpetual right to choose, free from the dictates of others, whether to transfer their land. Thus the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> expands the choices of landowners and promotes their independence and autonomy. Eliminating the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> would leave landowners vulnerable to the whims of others, and less free and autonomous. Landownership is not only about efficiency, but also about individual freedom...|$|R
50|$|Leased fee value - This {{is simply}} the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> {{interest}} encumbered by a lease. If the lease is at market rent, then the leased fee value and the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> value are equal. However, if the tenant pays {{more or less than}} market, the residual owned by the leased fee holder, plus the market value of the tenancy, may be more or less than the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> value.|$|R
50|$|Fee simple estates may {{be either}} <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>absolute</b> or defeasible (i.e. subject to future {{condition}}s) like {{fee simple determinable}} and fee simple subject to condition subsequent; this is the complex system of future interests (q.v.) which allows concepts of trusts and estates to elide into actuarial science {{through the use of}} life contingencies.|$|E
50|$|What {{would happen}} if the {{property}} were conveyed? Let's say A sold Blackacre to D. If A afterwards accepted an offer for a candy bar from C, Blackacre automatically goes to B. But if A died without ever accepting a candy bar from C, the condition could not possibly be met. D would then have a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>absolute.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{provisions}} of the habendum clause must agree with those stated in the granting clause. For example, if the grantor conveys a time share interest or an interest less than <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>absolute,</b> the habendum clause would specify the owner's rights {{as well as how}} those rights are limited (a specific time frame or certain prohibited activities, for instance). Many states, such as Pennsylvania, require a deed to have a habendum clause in order for the deed to be officially recorded and recognized by the Recorder of Deeds.|$|E
25|$|Takings {{may be of}} {{the subject}} {{property}} in its entirety (total take) or in part (part take), either quantitatively or qualitatively (either partially in <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> or, commonly, an easement, or any other interest less than the full <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> title).|$|R
50|$|Here, O is the {{original}} owner. She grants A a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> subject to the subsequent condition that he doesn't accept a candy bar from C. But unlike a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> subject to a condition subsequent, Blackacre goes to a third party (B) instead of the grantor (O) if the condition is met. Also unlike a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> subject to a condition subsequent, B then automatically gains the interest in Blackacre and does not only have a mere right to sue for re-entry.|$|R
50|$|An {{estate in}} <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> denotes the maximum {{ownership}} in land {{that can be}} legally granted; it is the greatest possible aggregate of rights, powers, privileges and immunities available in land.

50|$|In {{property}} {{law of the}} United Kingdom and the United States and other common law countries, a remainder is a future interest given to a person (who {{is referred to as}} the transferee or remainderman) that is capable of becoming possessory upon the natural end of a prior estate created by the same instrument. Thus, the prior estate must be one that is capable of ending naturally, for example upon the expiration of a term of years or the death of a life tenant. A future interest following a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>absolute</b> cannot be a remainder because of the preceding infinite duration.|$|E
5000|$|If {{previous}} grantors of a {{fee simple}} estate do not create any conditions for subsequent grantees, then the title is called <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>absolute.</b> A <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>absolute</b> is the highest estate permitted by law and it gives the holder full possessory rights and obligations {{now and in the}} future. Other {{fee simple estate}}s in real property include fee simple defeasible (or fee simple determinable) estates. A defeasible estate is created when a grantor places a condition on a fee simple estate (in the deed). When a specified event happens, the estate may become void or subject to annulment. There are two types of defeasible estates: fee simple determinable and the fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. If the grantor uses durational language in the condition such as [...] "to A. as long as the land is used for a park", then upon the happening of the specified event (in this case if the land is used for anything other than a park), the estate will automatically terminate and revert to the grantor or the grantor's estate; this is called a fee simple determinable. If the grantor uses language such as [...] "but if alcohol is served", then the grantor or the heirs have a right of entry if the condition occurs, but the estate does not automatically revert to the grantor; this is a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. In most jurisdictions in the United States these concepts have been modified by statute. Fee simple determinable was generally preferred by courts in the common law of the early United States. Recently, that trend has reversed, and most courts in the United States will find a fee simple subject to condition subsequent in situations where the conveying document's language is unclear.|$|E
50|$|In English law, a {{fee simple}} or <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>absolute</b> is an estate in land, {{a form of}} {{freehold}} ownership. It is a way that real estate may be owned in common law countries, and is the highest possible ownership interest that can be held in real property. Allodial title is reserved to governments under a civil law structure. The rights of the fee simple owner are limited by government powers of taxation, compulsory purchase, police power, and escheat, and {{it could also be}} limited further by certain encumbrances or conditions in the deed, such as, for example, a condition that required the land {{to be used as a}} public park, with a reversion interest in the grantor if the condition fails; this is a fee simple conditional.|$|E

The decisions of the Baltimore City government in its creation of a water system illustrate why some may be queasy about this.

40|$|Human nature {{dictates}} that private ownership of land creates conflict among neighbors. In {{the realm of}} adverse possession and prescriptive easements, the law intervenes to settle these disputes. Adverse possession quiets conflict by providing the ripened possessor with title in <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>absolute.</b> In contrast, a prescriptive easement provides the holder with only a right of use. However, there are occasions when a prescriptive easement establishes a right of use so broad and encompassing that it amounts to a grant of de facto possession. Thus, such a “comprehensive prescriptive easement” enables the court to award the equivalent of possession while only requiring proof of mere prescriptive use. This Note examines the problems of comprehensive prescriptive easements, and explores possible solutions where rights of use are the equivalent of possession...|$|E

Problem Definition In common law systems {{like that of the}} US, real property is often described as a “bundle of rights” (Baron 2014).
