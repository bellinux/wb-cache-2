40|$|AbstractUrgent {{computing}} enables {{responsible authorities}} to make educated decisions by supporting the computations of simulated predictions of time critical events. Unfortunately, most domains of science cannot afford dedicated resources for their urgent computing problems. As a solution, exploiting existing <b>e-Infrastructures</b> is invaluable for many problems if the {{wide array of}} available resources in today's <b>e-Infrastructures</b> can be utilised. In this paper, we focus on rarely occurring events that are best suited for urgent computations on existing HPC, Grid and Cloud <b>e-Infrastructures.</b> Since <b>e-Infrastructures</b> are meant to serve more than just one community of users, they have inherent characteristics {{that have to be}} modified or adapted in order to enable them effectively for urgent computing. We hope to demonstrate that there are many existing and on-going developments that can be leveraged to prepare existing <b>e-Infrastructures</b> for urgent computing...|$|R

To create this synergy among multi-disciplinary communities, BELIEF created a one-stop-shop providing a Portal and a Digital Library with a huge number of <b>e-Infrastructures</b> open access publications. The Digital Library offers uniform access to multimedia documentation providing continuously updated information on e-Infrastructures-related projects, initiatives and events. The contents are harvested from different sources, such as projects web sites, repositories and databases. The DL - implemented on top of the OpenDLib Digital Library Management System - provides services to support the submission, description, searching, browsing, retrieval, access, preservation and visualization of multimedia documents.

40|$|Major {{efforts are}} {{currently}} {{under way to}} develop <b>e-infrastructures</b> for research. At the same time, {{there have been a}} number of calls for research in the digital realm to foster 'openness', for example in 'open access' policies. This paper explores the relation between <b>e-infrastructures</b> and open science, and argues that there are a number of factors apart from research policy that will shape e-research. These include not only the legal and economic environment, but also the ethos of science, 'open' initiatives outside of research, the momentum of large technological systems, and the activism of experts and wider social movements. The paper assesses the strengths and weaknesses of these factors, as well as the tensions and confluences between openness and <b>e-infrastructures.</b> e-research, infrastructure, open science, social implications of technology, Internet and research, research policy,...|$|R
40|$|Biomedical {{researchers}} are facing data deluge challenges such as dealing with {{large volume of}} complex heterogeneous data and complex and computationally demanding data processing methods. Such scale and complexity of biomedical research requires multi-disciplinary collaboration between scientists from different organizations. Data-driven or e-Science methods are defined as a combination of Information Technology (IT) and science that enables scientists to tackle the data deluge challenges. The IT infrastructures that address these challenges are known as cyberinfrastructures or <b>e-Infrastructures,</b> which are the environments that provide collaborative sharing of distributed computing and data resources. However, <b>e-Infrastructures</b> fall short of high-level and customized services to support the needs of scientists genuinely, and scientists find interacting with <b>e-Infrastructures</b> challenging, as it requires detailed technical knowledge. Science Gateway (SG) research addresses these drawbacks. SGs are web-based enterprise information systems that provide scientists with customized and easy access to community-specific data collections, computational tools, and collaborative services on <b>e-Infrastructures.</b> In this thesis we advanced {{the understanding of the}} fundamentals of SGs for biomedical research by organizing the findings about the requirements of biomedical researchers. We also organized the considerations about the design, development, operation, and sustainability of effective SGs. Moreover, we constructed a few successful SGs that were adopted by a large number of scientists and facilitated their biomedical big data analysis on <b>e-Infrastructures.</b> Finally we proposed a reference model that organizes the essential functions of SGs. We think that these efforts will facilitate design, development, operation, sustainability, and most importantly, adoption of SGs for biomedical research...|$|R

40|$|Research <b>e-infrastructures</b> are "systems of systems", patchworks of tools, {{services}} and data sources, evolving {{over time to}} address the needs of the scientific process. Accordingly, in such environments, researchers implement their scientific processes by means of workflows made of a variety of actions, including for example usage of web services, download and execution of shared software libraries or tools, or local and manual manipulation of data. Although scientists may benefit from sharing their scientific process, the heterogeneity underpinning <b>e-infrastructures</b> hinders their ability to represent, share and eventually reproduce such workflows. This work presents HyWare, a language for representing scientific process in highly-heterogeneous <b>e-infrastructures</b> in terms of so-called hybrid workflows. HyWare lays in between "business process modeling languages", which offer a formal and high-level description of a reasoning, protocol, or procedure, and "workflow execution languages", which enable the fully automated execution of a sequence of computational steps via dedicated engines...|$|R

These include, for example, performance computing clusters with programs used in many areas, a large data repository used for data storage and sharing, multimedia communication tools making cooperation between distributed teams easier, and other services. These modern IT services are used for scientific and research work, and for problem solving focusing {{on a wide range of}} disciplines which are not confined to natural sciences, such as mathematics, physics, chemistry and computer science, but also include, for example, humanitarian sciences and art. The extensive <b>e-infrastructure</b> is composed of four basic logically coherent components:• high throughput communication infrastructure with a transfer speed of 100 Gbit/s (CESNET2),• grid infrastructure suitable for high performance computing,• data storage infrastructure, • infrastructure allowing collaboration between distributed teams and end user mobility.The CESNET <b>e-infrastructure</b> includes institutions such as public, state and private universities, institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, university hospitals, scientific and other libraries, technological and innovation centres and science parks, important cultural institutions and many other scientific and research institutions. The total number of individual users with access to the CESNET <b>e-infrastructure</b> in the Czech Republic is about 450 thousand persons. Thanks to a direct connection with GÉANT, the backbone network for science, research and education, and also thanks to a connection to research networks in other world regions provided by GÉANT (Internet2 and ESnet in the USA, AfricaConnect in Africa, TEIN in Asia and CLARA in the Pacific and Latin America), the CESNET e- infrastructure even allows cooperation and operation of demanding and unique applications and data sharing in the multinational and international scientific community.
