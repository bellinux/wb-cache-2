5|$|Perfect Dark Zero is a first-person shooter where players {{control the}} player {{character}} mostly from a first-person perspective. The combat features mechanics {{such as an}} evasive dodge roll and a cover {{system in which the}} gameplay switches to a third-person perspective, allowing the player to strategically aim without taking damage and be more aware of the surroundings. Players cannot jump but have the ability to automatically climb obstacles {{as long as they can}} reasonably reach them. It is also possible to climb ladders. By doing so, the camera shifts into a third-person perspective. The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. The health can recharge a bit if the player steps out of the line of fire for a few seconds, but it may not necessarily refill completely <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> damage the player took.|$|E

5|$|Cyclotorna monocentra moths feed on meat ant broods. The larvae {{of these}} moths are parasites to leafhoppers and {{will move to}} meat ant colonies to {{complete}} their development, where they will proceed to consume the brood; the females lay many eggs near ant trails which {{are close to the}} leafhoppers tended by ants. Other observations show that the Iphierga macarista larvae are scavengers in meat ant nests, while Sphallomorpha beetles live in burrows near nests of meat ants, where the larvae capture and prey on workers passing by. The larvae of the spitfire sawfly and Pseudoperga guerini are able to regurgitate a fluid against the meat ant if they are getting attacked by them; <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> is regurgitated, an ant will either walk away and clean itself or become fatally affected by it. Lizards such as the thorny dragon, which is a sit and wait predator, consume meat ants, but other lizards which eat Iridomyrmex ants usually reject this species.|$|E
5|$|The safest way to {{view the}} Sun's disk is by {{indirect}} projection. This {{can be done by}} projecting an image of the disk onto a white piece of paper or card using a pair of binoculars (with one of the lenses covered), a telescope, or another piece of cardboard with a small hole in it (about 1mm diameter), often called a pinhole camera. The projected image of the Sun can then be safely viewed; this technique can be used to observe sunspots, as well as eclipses. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that no one looks through the projector (telescope, pinhole, etc.) directly. Viewing the Sun's disk on a video display screen (provided by a video camera or digital camera) is safe, although the camera itself may be damaged by direct exposure to the Sun. The optical viewfinders provided with some video and digital cameras are not safe. Securely mounting #14 welder's glass in front of the lens and viewfinder protects the equipment and makes viewing possible. Professional workmanship is essential because of the dire consequences any gaps or detaching mountings will have. In the partial eclipse path, one {{will not be able to}} see the corona or nearly complete darkening of the sky, however, <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of the Sun's disk is obscured, some darkening may be noticeable. If three-quarters or more of the sun is obscured, then an effect can be observed by which the daylight appears to be dim, as if the sky were overcast, yet objects still cast sharp shadows.|$|E
5|$|Mammalian coats are colored for {{a variety}} of reasons, the major {{selective}} pressures including camouflage, sexual selection, communication and physiological processes such as temperature regulation. Camouflage is a powerful influence in a large number of mammals, as it helps to conceal individuals from predators or prey. Aposematism, warning off possible predators, is the most likely explanation of the black-and-white pelage of many mammals which are able to defend themselves, such as in the foul-smelling skunk and the powerful and aggressive honey badger. In arctic and subarctic mammals such as the arctic fox (Alopex lagopus), collared lemming (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus), stoat (Mustela erminea), and snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), seasonal color change between brown in summer and white in winter is driven largely by camouflage. Differences in female and male coat color may indicate nutrition and hormone levels, important in mate selection. Some arboreal mammals, notably primates and marsupials, have shades of violet, green, or blue skin on parts of their bodies, indicating some distinct advantage in their largely arboreal habitat due to convergent evolution. The green coloration of sloths, however, {{is the result of a}} symbiotic relationship with algae. Coat color is sometimes sexually dimorphic, as in many primate species. Coat color may influence the ability to retain heat, <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> light is reflected. Mammals with a darker colored coat can absorb more heat from solar radiation, and stay warmer, and some smaller mammals, such as voles, have darker fur in the winter. The white, pigmentless fur of arctic mammals, such as the polar bear, may reflect more solar radiation directly onto the skin.|$|E

25|$|Although a Super CO Power is in {{many cases}} better than the normal CO Power, the CO Meter is drained {{differently}} depending on which power was activated. While Super CO Power will drain the CO Meter completely, the normal CO Power would leave players with some leftover charge on the CO Meter <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> existed before the CO Power.

25|$|Treatment of {{phenobarbital}} overdose is supportive, and mainly {{consists of}} the maintenance of airway patency (through endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation), correction of bradycardia and hypotension (with intravenous fluids and vasopressors, if necessary) and removal of as much drug {{as possible from the}} body. <b>Depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> time has elapsed since ingestion of the drug, this may be accomplished through gastric lavage (stomach pumping) or use of activated charcoal.

25|$|Elizabeth Cashdan {{proposed}} that mate strategies among both genders differ <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> parental investment {{is expected of}} the male, and provided research support for her hypotheses. When men expect to have to provide {{a high level of}} parental investment, they will attempt to attract women by emphasising their ability to invest. In addition, men who expect to invest {{will be more likely to}} highlight their chastity and fidelity than men who expect not to invest. Men with the expectation of low parental investment will flaunt their sexuality to women. The author argues the fact the research supports the idea that men expecting to invest emphasise their chastity and fidelity, which is a high cost strategy (because it lowers reproductive opportunities), suggests that that type of behaviour must be beneficial, or the behaviour would not have been selected.|$|E

25|$|The {{fluid in}} the {{internal}} compartments where corals grow their exoskeleton is also extremely important for calcification growth. When the saturation rate of aragonite in the external seawater is at ambient levels, the corals will grow their aragonite crystals rapidly in their internal compartments, hence their exoskeleton grows rapidly. If the level of aragonite in the external seawater {{is lower than the}} ambient level, the corals have to work harder to maintain the right balance {{in the internal}} compartment. When that happens, the process of growing the crystals slows down, and this slows down the rate of how much their exoskeleton is growing. <b>Depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> aragonite is in the surrounding water, the corals may even stop growing because the levels of aragonite are too low to pump into the internal compartment. They could even dissolve faster than they can make the crystals to their skeleton, depending on the aragonite levels in the surrounding water.|$|E
25|$|NSB {{presumed that}} a similar {{operating}} procedure be carried out for a branch service. However, it proposed a different route which branched off west of Lysaker Station. By linking these with various lines to the east, this would allow direct services to the airport from the Ã˜stfold Line, the GjÃ¸vik Line and the Trunk Line. For a loop service, NSB proposed that the airport be served with existing commuter trains running on the Drammen Line between Asker Station and LillestrÃ¸m Station (today's line L1). The main advantage {{was that it would}} allow all regional and express trains, including those serving to the Bergen Line, the SÃ¸rlandet Line and the Vestfold Line, to call at the airport. Travel times were estimated at 12 minutes to Oslo Central Station, 18 minutes to Asker, and 25 and 33 minutes, respectively by commuter and express train, to Drammen Station. NSB estimated a twenty-five percent market share, giving an estimated 3,500 to 8,000 daily passengers, <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> airline traffic was allocated to Fornebu. A major advantage was that it would largely come as an additional product for existing services and would thus be economically favorable for NSB.|$|E

25|$|One {{of three}} mission {{outcomes}} is possible: either the human forces are eliminated, the alien forces are neutralized, or the player chooses to withdraw. The mission's score {{and the result}} {{are based on the}} number of X-COM operatives lost (either dead, unconscious, or under alien control), civilians saved or perished, aliens killed or captured, and the number and quality of alien artifacts obtained. Troops may also increase in rank or abilities if they made successful use of their primary attributes (e.g. killing enemies). Instead of gaining experience points, surviving human combatants might get an automatic rise (a semi-random amount <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of the action in which they participated) to their attributes, such as Psi or Accuracy. The soldiers who have been killed on a mission will remain dead, but can be replaced with raw recruits back at base. In addition to combat personnel, the player may use unmanned ground vehicles that are outfitted with heavy weapons and well armored but large, costly, and not gaining experience. Recovered alien artifacts can then be researched and possibly reproduced. Captured live aliens may produce information, possibly leading to new technologies and even an access to psionic warfare.|$|E
25|$|The {{producers}} {{wanted to}} have a gathering place outside of home and work where the characters could meet. After a trip to Seattle, and seeing the many burgeoning coffee shops, the production designer suggested to producers that they use a coffee shop. Unlike many of the relatively modern coffee shop designs prevalent in Seattle, the production designer opted for a more warm and inviting style which would appear more established and traditional. Stools were specifically omitted to avoid any similarity to the bar on Cheers. Several Los Angeles coffee shops were used for reference. A bookcase was added on the back wall, suggesting patrons could grab a book and read while they enjoyed their coffee. The show used three versions of the interior set <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> space other sets for each episode required. If there was not space for the full set, a smaller version that omitted the tables closest to the audience could be used.

25|$|In {{collecting}} his testimony, Kennedy realised {{that women}} were being treated as badly as children and widened his scope to include them as well.

Wardle told Kennedy she started work at the age of 6 whilst Hardman said she started at the age of 7. Wardle later described how she was employed to 'draw with belt and chain'; that is pull the tubs along the underground rails by means of a leather waist belt to the back of which was attached a chain to the tub, used where the tunnels were too small for the use of ponies, (ponies were not used at Outwood, so this must refer to Ladyshore). She then went on to tell Kennedy that she was forced to work whilst pregnant and that she had one child of her four in the mine, the work had brought on labour and the newborn was carried out of the mine in her skirt.|$|E
