5|$|Bears {{have been}} hunted for sport, food, and folk medicine. Their meat <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> and stringy, like a tough cut of beef. In Cantonese cuisine, bear paws are {{considered}} a delicacy. Bear meat should be cooked thoroughly, {{as it can be}} infected with the parasite Trichinella spiralis.|$|E
5|$|Bulliard gave Boletus aereus {{the common}} name of le bolet bronzé (the bronze bolete) in 1789, noting {{that it was}} called the cep noir (black cep) in other countries. It is {{commonly}} known as ontto beltza (black fungus) in Basque, porcino nero (black piglet) in Italian, and Cèpe bronzé in French. In Greek it is known as vasilikό (the royal one), or kalogeraki (little monk). The English common name <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> cep, while the British Mycological Society also approved the name bronze bolete.|$|E
5|$|Dark {{matter is}} the matter in the {{universe}} that cannot be seen. Because of the gravitational effect it exerts on stars and galaxies, scientists know that approximately 80% of the matter in the universe <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> matter. The spatial distribution of dark matter in the universe is largely unknown; SIM Lite would have helped scientists answer to this question.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 17-19 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>dark</b> {{brown and}} the markings <b>are</b> <b>darker.</b> The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>dark</b> grey-brown and the fringes are grey-brown.|$|R
50|$|The {{story is}} about a young barn owl called Plop, who is frightened of the <b>dark.</b> The plot <b>is</b> divided into seven chapters, each {{covering}} a night during which Plop learns something new about the dark: <b>dark</b> <b>is</b> exciting, <b>dark</b> <b>is</b> kind, <b>dark</b> <b>is</b> fun, <b>dark</b> <b>is</b> necessary, <b>dark</b> <b>is</b> fascinating, <b>dark</b> <b>is</b> wonderful and <b>dark</b> <b>is</b> beautiful. Plop is gradually persuaded that the dark has its advantages.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 19-21 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>dark</b> purple-fuscous and the hindwings <b>are</b> <b>dark</b> fuscous.|$|R
5|$|Lloyd's mirror generates {{interference}} fringes {{by combining}} direct {{light from a}} source (blue lines) and light from the source's reflected image (red lines) from a mirror held at grazing incidence. The result is an asymmetrical pattern of fringes. Interestingly, the band of equal path length, nearest the mirror, <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> rather than bright. In 1834, Humphrey Lloyd interpreted this effect as proof that the phase of a front-surface reflected beam is inverted.|$|E
5|$|Ruthenium trichloride is a {{well-known}} compound, existing in a black α-form and a dark brown β-form: the trihydrate is red. Of the known trihalides, trifluoride <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> brown and decomposes above 650°C, tetrabromide is dark-brown and decomposes above 400°C, and triiodide is black. Of the dihalides, difluoride is not known, dichloride is brown, dibromide is black, and diiodide is blue. The only known oxyhalide is the pale green ruthenium(VI) oxyfluoride, RuOF4.|$|E
5|$|Starlings and mynas {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} Old World passerine birds with strong feet. Their flight {{is strong and}} direct and most are very gregarious.

5|$|The chapel {{beneath its}} large onion dome <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> and {{cavernous}} {{and decorated with}} carved giltwood, the detailing highlighted in red, green, blue and pink, by the Portuguese sculptor Silvestre Faria Lobo. The upper level has galleries {{for the use of}} royal personages who would sit apart from the congregation. One of these galleries contains a small Rococo pipe organ. A feature of the chapel is the ornate portable font, its marble basin resting in an elaborate Rococo frame surmounted by a carved wood cover.|$|E

5|$|The flag of Pakistan symbolizes Pakistan's {{commitment}} to Islam and equal rights of religious minorities where the larger portion (3:2 ratio) of flag <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> green representing Muslim majority (98% of total population) while a white vertical bar (3:1 ratio) at the mast representing {{equal rights for}} religious minorities and minority religions in country. The crescent and star symbolizes progress and bright future respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{front of}} the head of the female in {{breeding}} plumage is yellow, gradually changing to olive green {{at the back of the}} head, except for the broad yellow rear brow, while the area between the eye and the bill <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> greenish grey, and the area around the ear is green. The head is surrounded by a broad yellow collar that includes the chin. The remainder of the female breeding plumage is identical to the male's.|$|E
5|$|The {{juvenile}} pied butcherbird has {{dark brown}} instead of black plumage, lacks the pale collar {{and has a}} cream to buff lores, chin, and upper throat, becoming more brown on the lower throat and breast. Its underparts are off-white to cream. The bill <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> brown. In its first year, it moults into its first immature plumage, which resembles that of the juvenile, but has a more extensive dark brown throat. Its bill is blue-grey with a dark brown or blackish tip.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 13 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>dark</b> fuscous, faintly purplish-tinged. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>dark</b> grey.|$|R

5|$|The sparsely haired tail {{is about}} as long as the head and body. It <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> brown above and lighter below. In contrast, the tail of H.megacephalus has little to no {{difference}} in color between the upper and lower surface. In 2006, Weksler and colleagues noted tail coloration as a difference between the two species of Transandinomys (bicolored in T.talamancae and unicolored in T.bolivaris), but in their 1998 study, Musser and colleagues could not find differences in tail coloration between their Panamanian samples of the two species.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> purplish brown. Spores {{typically}} measure 7.5–9.5 by 5.5–6.5 by 4.5–5.5μm, averaging 8.7 by 6.0 by 5.3μm. Its shape in face view is ovate (egg-shaped) to roughly rhomboid, while {{viewed from the}} side it appears elliptical. The spore wall is brown, smooth, about 0.8–1μm thick, and has a germ pore. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and somewhat club-shaped, tapering slightly to the base; they are clamped, and measure 25–31 by 7–8.5μm.|$|E
5|$|The tail appears {{naked and}} is shorter than or {{about as long}} as the head and body; it is longer in T.talamancae. Its {{coloration}} is variable; it <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> brown above and at the sides and light brown and often white to a greater or smaller extent below, and in some specimens the tail has the same color above and below. The scales on the tail are smaller than in T.talamancae.|$|E

5|$|Akodon caenosus is the {{smallest}} of the Argentine members of the A.boliviensis group–indeed, among {{the smallest}} of all species of Akodon. The upperparts are uniformly colored, but their tone is variable: generally ochraceous brown, but approaching yellow, red, or olivaceous in some individuals. Reddish tones occur mostly in lactating females. High-altitude animals are generally lighter, but there is also conspicuous variation within populations. The ears are similar to the upperparts, but some individuals have the sides more rich and clear in color. The underparts are clearly different in color, varying from light gray to yellowish or reddish. There are yellowish rings around the eyes, which are more highly developed in high-altitude populations. There are white to yellowish hairs on the fore- and hindfeet. The tail is variably covered with hair and <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> brown above and white to buffy below.|$|E
5|$|Although both colour morphs {{occur in}} much of the European range, brown birds predominate in the more humid climate of western Europe, with the grey phase {{becoming}} more common further east; in the northernmost regions, all the owls are a cold-grey colour. Siberian and Central Asian subspecies have grey and white plumage, the North African race <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> grey-brown, and South and East Asian birds have barred, not striped, underparts, and fine lines around the facial disc. The Siberian and Scandinavian subspecies are 12% larger and 40% heavier, and have 13% longer wings than western European birds, in accordance with Bergmann's rule which predicts that northern forms will typically be bigger than their southern counterparts.|$|E
5|$|At {{least two}} livery {{variants}} were tested on scale models, which were later exposed at VR's conference centre at Helsinki central railway station: {{one has a}} red strip for the whole length of the train, with the window backgrounds painted grey. The other is more similar to the final result, but {{the front of the}} train includes more red and no grey paint at all. VR finally settled to a combination of both of them, which bore resemblance to the company's InterCity livery. The bottom of the carriages <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> grey, with a red stripe distinguishing it from the white base colour. The top of the carriages is painted grey. Red colouring {{at the end of each}} car forms red parallelograms when the carriages are combined. When asked why the trains were not blue and white, VR's CEO answered that red and white fits the train and its design the best.|$|E
