40|$|This {{report was}} {{prepared}} {{as part of}} research programme {{funded in part by}} the Commission of the European Communities, European Coal and Steel Contract (BC Contract No. 7220 - AF/ 136). A number of geophysical methods have been applied to a sequence of test areas in the vicinity of Saarbrucken, Germany. The studies relate to methods for the recognition of <b>geological</b> <b>weakness</b> <b>zones</b> and other surface discontinuities caused by underground mining in Carboniferous terrain. Progress to date (October, 1993) is summarised by Greenwood and Peart (1992). This report discusses a new method of data modelling applied to VLF data collected along three short (50 m) profiles in Saar Test Area 2. 1. The data used in the study have previously been described by Greenwood and Peart (1992). The main aim of the report is to demonstrate an automatic method {{for the construction of a}} resistivity cross-section when suitable VLF-R data are supplied. The method used (two-dimensional, non-linear, regularised inversion) has not been used previously in an applied geophysical context. This report therefore discusses the scientific rationale and the known pitfalls of the procedure. The method is also applied to both synthetic models and the field data in order to assist in the interpretation of the results obtained...|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{resistivity}} method {{which was}} championed by geophysicist has increasingly popular in civil engineering application {{due to its}} efficiency in term of cost, time and data coverage. This study performed with particular reference to electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) in evaluating the slope failure at Kenyir Lake, Malaysia. During the data acquisition, two lines of ERI was performed using ABEM Terrameter LS set of equipment based on Schlumberger array. Moreover, electrical resistivity anomaly was managed to detect the presence of geological structure with particular reference to fault and rock discontinuities which associated to low resistivity anomaly. The heterogeneous of the subsurface material presented using integrated analysis of ERI and borehole data enabled forensic assessment of the landslide. The combination of heavy rainfall and existing <b>geological</b> structure (<b>weakness</b> <b>zone)</b> {{was believed to be}} a major factor which triggered this failed slope. This result was applicable to assist the geotechnical engineer in design concept recommendation of the slope remediation with fast, less cost and wide data coverage. Finally, ERI results with borehole verification was applicable to be adopted in landslide forensic assessment based on slope geomaterials stiffness variations generated after the slope movement...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{covers the}} {{question}} if oriented rock cores {{can be of}} benefit, compared with non-oriented rock cores when determining the orientation of a <b>weakness</b> <b>zone</b> within a rock mass. The aim is to suggest when oriented rock cores is preferable to use and to make concluding remarks on the advantage and disadvantage of oriented rock cores compared to non-oriented rock cores for <b>weakness</b> <b>zone</b> prediction. In mining and civil engineering and especially in areas with low stresses (i. e. often shallow or distressed constructions), the discontinuities in the rock mass are of great importance for the stability. The discontinuities consists of beddings, joints and <b>weakness</b> <b>zones</b> that reduce {{the strength of the}} rock mass and therefore the structures are investigated in an early stage to prevent cause of structural dependent failures. In this work the definition of a <b>weakness</b> <b>zone</b> is a zone of very poor rock (Rock Quality Designation (RQD) less than 10 %) that is greater than 20 cm in width. The hypothesis used in this work is that the <b>weakness</b> <b>zone</b> has a high joint frequency and that this frequency is decreasing further away from the zone. The data provided and analyzed in this work has been from rock cores in seven boreholes, each with different amount of orientation data available. The procedure has been developed in a stepwise manner, where each step was of equal importance for the preceding step. Each detected <b>weakness</b> <b>zone</b> in the studied rock cores was summarized and the orientation data was utilized in a stereographic projection. To cover all the potential important structures, the orientations of joints at a distance of two meters before and two meters after the observed <b>weakness</b> <b>zone</b> were added in the projection. Based on the stereographic projection a mean value of the major orientation was determined for each major joint set with a deviation of 15 degrees. The orientations and the width of the observed <b>weakness</b> <b>zones</b> in the seven boreholes were extrapolated in a 3 D software to predict the intersection of the zones in the surrounding boreholes. Photos of the rock core at the predicted depths were studied and compare with the visual characteristics of the analyzed <b>weakness</b> <b>zone</b> that was the starting point (reference zone) to find the propagation of the <b>weakness</b> <b>zone</b> within the rock mass. The orientation of the <b>weakness</b> <b>zones</b> those could be connected to the reference zone were studied and compared in order to verify the interpolation of the reference zone. When verifying the connection from the reference <b>zone</b> to the <b>weakness</b> <b>zones</b> in the surrounding boreholes this weakness planes are further called large scale <b>weakness</b> <b>zone</b> in this thesis. Based on the evaluation 14 large scale <b>weakness</b> <b>zones</b> could be summarized and based on the comparison with photos of the rock cores these zones is assumed to be predicted with high certainty. The conclusion from this study was that oriented rock core can be of large benefit when determining the orientation and location of a <b>weakness</b> <b>zone.</b> This study has shown that with the stepwise procedure, used to evaluate major <b>weakness</b> <b>zones</b> by orientation data and through comparison with rock core photos, the location and orientation could be predicted. Hence, one oriented rock core can be used to study the geology, rock mechanic properties as well as prediction of location and orientation of structures. The stepwise procedure to study <b>weakness</b> <b>zones</b> in this work can be of use in the design of rock constructions where structures are likely to control the stability or i. e. when {{it is important to know}} the location and orientation of ore contacts. By determining the orientations of <b>weakness</b> <b>zones</b> within the rock mass the constructions can be designed with respect to these and reduce potential structural dependent failures. If this is fully performed with good precision and accuracy the amount of boreholes can most likely be reduced, compared with using non-oriented rock cores, which might lead to lower costs.

40|$|When {{planning}} for a tunnel, the ground conditions in which the tunnel {{is going to be}} excavated through will be investigated to different extent. Lack of relevant pre-investigation data or misinterpretations of the available data can cause both economical and/or unexpected stability problems. <b>Weakness</b> <b>zones</b> that are expected to cross the tunnel could be investigated thoroughly with a variety of methods. Refraction seismicity survey and 2 D resistivity survey are two geophysical methods that are common in Norway for obtaining information about the rock quality in <b>weakness</b> <b>zones.</b> In this work, a twin tunnel under construction in Bodø (northern Norway) called the Bodøtunnel is studied. The predictions based on the pre-investigation for crossing of some expected <b>weakness</b> <b>zones</b> are compared to the actual conditions encountered during tunneling. Tunneling observations (Geological mapping and photos), rock samples and measurement while drilling (MWD) were used to describe the <b>weakness</b> <b>zones</b> that were encountered during tunneling. Rock samples were collected from two <b>weakness</b> <b>zones</b> and the general rock mass. These samples were tested in a point bearing machine for determination of their uniaxial compressive strength (UCS). These results indicated that the rock samples gathered from the <b>weakness</b> <b>zones</b> had significantly lower UCS than the samples from the rock mass. This was exceedingly clear for the samples of fault rock gathered in connection with a shear zone. The results from this work demonstrate that refraction seismicity had a high success rate for locating <b>weakness</b> <b>zones,</b> with the exception for the crossed narrow zones that were interpreted lacking a shear component. Empirical formulas relating Q-value and UCS with the seismic wave speed were used for calculating these factors for some interesting locations. The empirically calculated UCS was similar to the obtained UCS from the point bearing tests, while the empirically calculated Q-value showed large deviations from the mapped Q-value. The resistivity measurements had a low success rate so far in this project; the reason for this could be disturbances in the ground and the location of the resistivity profiles, which had to adapted to the nearby railroad. It should be noted that only one full resistivity profile has been crossed {{and the rest of the}} profiles are expected to be more accurate. Based on the results from the crossed profile(s), the suitability of resistivity survey 2 D in urban areas can be brought to question. This work also stumbled upon problems regarding the definition of <b>weakness</b> <b>zones.</b> Shear/fault zones are one of the more common type of <b>weakness</b> <b>zones</b> encountered in tunneling. These kind of zones often consists of different parts. Depending on which parts are regarded as a <b>weakness</b> <b>zone</b> by the responsible engineers, the Q-value might differ due to the SRF. Different scenarios were also evaluated with numerical modeling for the expected remaining major <b>weakness</b> <b>zones.</b> This analysis highlights the importance of differentiation between more fractured zones and zones containing fault rock, such as breccia. The width of the zone had a major impact on the stability while the dip for wide zones had a minor impact on the stability, as long the zones dip is not so small that both tunnels are intersected at the same time. The rock mechanical parameter of the <b>weakness</b> <b>zones</b> that had the most impact on the overall stability was the cohesion...|$|R
40|$|Nepal {{is a land}} locked {{country with}} diversified {{topographical}} and geological features. Most of its parts are covered by the low hills to high Himalayas. The Himalayan geology {{is one of the}} tectonically youngest geological formations in the world. Except the young formations, rock mass in the Himalaya is highly weathered, fractured and weak in strength and is thus challenging for the construction of underground structure like tunnel and caverns especially for the development of hydropower project. Middle Modi Hydropower Project (MMHP) is also facing the problem with weathered, fractured and weak rock mass for the construction of headrace tunnel. The Middle Modi Hydropower Project (MMHP) is a run of the river scheme with installed capacity 15 MW. Design discharge of 25 m 3 /s is feeding 2 Francis turbines utilizing the grosshead of 75. 34 m. Geologically, MMHP lies in the Precambrian sequence of the lesser Himalayan meta-sedimentary rock formation of Baglung zone. The extension of Lumle Fault crossing the project area is challenge for the underground structures. The major structures of the project are headworks, approximately 2. 8 km headrace tunnel with 34 m height surge tank and semi surface power house. Quartzite and Phyllite are the major rock types covered throughout the whole length of 2. 8 Km headrace tunnel. Quartzite and Phyllite rock mass formation are highly weathered, fractured and shared, and separated by the Sathi khola fault (Extension of Lumle Fault) about chainage 1 + 800 is the weakest part of headrace tunnel. The main aim {{of this study was to}} analyze hydraulic fracturing, rock support design throughout the headrace tunnel and carry out stability analysis in the <b>weakness</b> <b>zone</b> (Lumle Fault) by different approaches. Analysis of hydraulic fracturing from the different approaches; deterministic, analytical and finally verified by numerical model phase 2. The highest hydrostatic water pressure in headrace tunnel was found to be 0. 3 MPa. From numerical analysis, possible hydraulic fracturing was shown in tunnel crown in the <b>weakness</b> <b>zone.</b> From the analysis of few sections, rock bolts and shotcrete is sufficient for rock support except for the <b>weakness</b> <b>zone</b> of headrace tunnel. Stability analysis of the major <b>weakness</b> <b>zone</b> in headrace tunnel using empirical, semi analytical and numerical methods have been presented. From both empirical and semianalytical analysis, squeezing problem was found in the <b>weakness</b> <b>zone.</b> Moreover, it was also verified from numerical analysis that about 1 m of displacement was found in the periphery of tunnel contour. Consolidation grouting before tunnel excavation and shotcrete with reinforced concrete in <b>weakness</b> <b>zone</b> and except the <b>weakness</b> <b>zone</b> simply rockbolts and shotcrete has been proposed for the long term stability of headrace tunnel. Finally, based on the empirical, semi-analytical and numerical analysis; conclusion and recommendation have been made for the tunnel excavation, support installation and safety measure, further geological investigation and monitoring during construction. </p...|$|R

30|$|<b>Weakness</b> <b>zones</b> {{such as the}} {{fracture}} zone, the clayey layers and the hydrothermal alteration zone of anorthosite are distributed in the ground. Tension cracks and scarps {{were found in the}} upper part of the slope. The clayey layers of anorthosite was exposed in the lower part of it, showing the horizontal continuity. According to the result of the boring survey, {{the fracture}} zone and the clayey layers caused by hydrothermal alteration and weathering were found around the lithologic boundary between the sedimentary rocks and anorthosite. Using the electric resistivity survey, it was discovered that the low resistivity zone is related to the tectonic zone and the characteristics of the strata. Through comparison with the results of the boring survey, it was verified that the <b>weakness</b> <b>zone</b> has high correlation to the low resistivity zone below 500  Ωm. Taking into consideration of the above-mentioned, it is inferred that the ground deformation occurred during the excavation as a result of reactivated landslides along the lithologic boundary.|$|R

The dam failed in 1928, due to a then undetectable <b>geological</b> <b>weakness</b> in the bedrock. The resulting flood, sent a massive wave of water and debris down the canyon and the Santa Clara River Valley and to the sea, killing up to 600 people. Some of these debris can still be found today littering the creek bed.|$|R

Other volcanic centres such as Galán and ore deposits are also found on this lineament.

Farther south lie volcanoes such as Wheelwright Caldera and Cerro Blanco, the last of which shows evidence of recent unrest.|$|R
30|$|According to {{the results}} of the investigations, the study area {{consists}} of conglomerate in the upper part which is mainly fractured and highly weathered, and anorthosite in the lower part, forming an unconformity between them. There are <b>weakness</b> <b>zones</b> such as the fracture zone, the clayey layers and the hydrothermal alteration zone of anorthosite, distributed along the lithologic boundary between conglomerate and anorthosite. Especially, it is inferred that the clayey layers are formed due to highly altered hydrothermal alteration and weathering. These layers have the average thickness of 1  –  2  m, slanting 10  –  15 ° upward. As a result of hazard assessment for the reactivated landslide of the study area, it can be inferred that the deep-seated (about 15  –  35  m) clayey layers are the slip surface and the trigger for the movement. Primary causes of the landslides are due to increased water pressure, decrease of shear strength and frictional resistance along the clayey layers of anorthosite. The type of the landslides is a rock slide caused by parallel movement along the planes of the <b>weakness</b> <b>zones.</b>|$|R
40|$|Independent of Indochina extrusion, the South China Sea {{experienced}} a process from passive continental rifting to marginal sea drifting. According to the fault {{patterns in the}} Beibu Gulf basin and the Pearl River Mouth basin, the continental rifting and early spreading stage from 32 to 26 Ma were controlled by extensional stress field, which shifted clockwise from southeastward to south southeastward. From 24 Ma on, the sea spread in NW-SE direction and ceased spreading at around 15. 5 Ma. Integrated geological information {{with the assumption that}} the South China Sea developed along a pre-Cenozoic <b>weakness</b> <b>zone,</b> we did analogue experiments on the South China Sea evolution. Experiments revealed that the pre-existing <b>weakness</b> <b>zone</b> goes roughly along the uplift zone between the present Zhu- 1 and Zhu- 2 depression. The pre-existing <b>weakness</b> <b>zone</b> is composed of three segments trending NNE, roughly EW and NEE, respectively. The early opening of the South China Sea is accompanied with roughly 150 clockwise rotation, while the SE sub-sea basin opened with SE extension. Tinjar fault was the western boundary of the Nansha block (Dangerous Ground), while Lupar fault was the eastern boundary of the Indochina, NW-trending rift belt known as Zengmu basin developed between above two faults due to block divergent of Indochina from Nansha. In the experiment, transtensional flower structures along NW-trending faults are seen, and slight inversion occurs along some NE-dipping faults. The existence of rigid massifs changed the orientations of some faults and rift belt, and also led to deformation concentrate around the massifs. The rifting and drifting of the South China Sea might be caused by slab pull from the proto South China Sea subducting toward Borneo and/or mantle flow caused by India-Asia collision...|$|R

30|$|Water {{consumption}} in Taiwan has increased significantly in recent years. The Water Resources Agency and the Taiwan Water Corporation have raised certain issues regarding {{the quantity and}} quality of water. According to statistical data, the island’s average annual rainfall is approximately 2515  mm. Despite its abundance, rainfall is unevenly distributed in terms of both time and space. Because of the island’s steep natural terrain, short river flows, and <b>geological</b> <b>weaknesses,</b> the majority of rainwater flows out to sea before it can be harnessed for public use. Thus, reservoirs are an essential means of realizing effective water usage. From the viewpoint of water resource management, both the availability and quality of water are a concern.|$|R

40|$|Chile has a {{favorable}} topography for hydropower with the Andes mountain rising {{along the eastern}} border of the country. La Confluencia is a 158 MW run of the river plant located in the Tinguiririca Valley approximately 150 km south of Santiago. Parts of the two water tunnels are situated in a rock formation, locally known as Coya Machalí, where problems with expansive rocks have been encountered. Typical problems start out as hairline cracks in the shotcrete which may progress to more serious problems. Deterioration of the rock mass has also been observed. The free flow Portillo tunnel was finished in 2011. After two years of operations, cracks in the shotcrete were discovered in the right wall {{in a part of}} the tunnel. The deformation was about 10 cm at the worst, and related to a <b>weakness</b> <b>zone.</b> A study about swelling and slaking of rocks have been conducted. The main task has been to assess the stability of the section where the described problems occurred. Thin sections have been studied, and point load strength test and slake durability test have been carried out on samples from the Portillo tunnel. In addition data from construction mapping, several reports and maps from the project have been studied. A field visit has also been carried out. Method and results of XRD, DTA and tests of swelling potential carried out in earlier work are described. The content of smectite has been confirmed through XRD on ethylene glycol treated samples. Thin sections are difficult to interpret due to a fine grained matrix and alteration of the samples. The result from the point load strength test show that the samples have low to medium strength, while slake durability is low for the weakest sample, while it is high for the others. The focus of the stability analysis is mainly on displacements associated with the <b>weakness</b> <b>zone.</b> This have been conducted through a semi-analytical approach and a numerical analysis in RS- 2. Both show large deformations, but the methods have some weaknesses. In the numerical analysis different material properties have been tested both for the rock mass surrounding the <b>weakness</b> <b>zone,</b> and the zone itself. Special for this type of rock is the time before stability problems occur. The assessment shows that a gradual reduction in rock strength can lead to shotcrete problems. The same displacement can be seen with only weak material in the <b>weakness</b> <b>zone,</b> as when a stronger material combined with swelling pressure is applied. The approach used in the thesis is not suitable to assess the effect of additional support. It is suspected that the material has degraded from the time of excavation, and it is recommended to continue inspections in case of further reduction of rock mass quality...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Late Cretaceous-Tertiary {{structural}} {{evolution of}} the northeastern part of the Voring Basin, mid-Norway, is highly complicated. Although tectonic activity occurred throughout Cretaceous time {{in much of the}} Voring Basin, including the Gjallar Ridge and along the Fles Fault Zone, in the Vema Dome-Nyk High area evidence of such activity is not observed until the latest Maastrichtian time. In the Vema Dome-Nyk High area, several faults with both a NW-SE orientation and a NE-SW orientation have experienced lateral movements. The NE-SW orientation is the old Caledonian trend. The complex structural {{evolution of the}} Vema Dome-Nyk High area is probably related to the existence of continental <b>weakness</b> <b>zones,</b> which are the onshore extension of known oceanic fracture zones. The two lineaments hat delineate these <b>weakness</b> <b>zones,</b> and that delineate the Vema Dome-Nyk High area, namely the Bivrost and Surt Lineaments, diverge slightly from one another toward the SE. This complex structural framework of NW-SE oriented lineaments and NE-SW oriented eep-seated basement s ructures of Caledonian compressional nd/or Mesozoic rift origin, facilitated minor clockwise rotation of the area between the two lineaments during the extensional regime before the break-up of the North Atlantic, as well as during the compressional regime that has been proposed after the break-up. Several regional tectonic studies have been car-ried out around the Voring Basin on the mid-Norway continental margin (Fig. 1) (Brekke &...|$|R
40|$|The Tellnes {{ilmenite}} deposit, a {{world class}} titanium deposit, {{occurs in the}} Ana-Sira anorthosite (Rogaland anorthosite province, South Norway). It is mainly made up of an ilmenite-rich norite that has been previously interpreted as injected in a crystal mush state, in a <b>weakness</b> <b>zone</b> of the enclosing anorthosite. This emplacement mechanism has produced a faint orientation in the ore due to {{the flow of the}} mush. The internal flow structure of the orebody is studied here using the low-field anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) method. Partial anhysteretic remanent magnetization (pAARM) indicates that coarse magnetite is the main mineral responsible for the magnetic fabric. Parallelism of the magnetic fabric with the shape-preferred orientation of the ore-forming minerals is checked using image analysis (IA) from oriented sections (intercept method). Interpretation of the AMS data verified by pAARM and IA, provides information on the magmatic foliation and lineation. Emplacement flow of the ilmenite norite crystal mush occurred {{in the direction of the}} orebody, parallel to its walls, and with an average SE 18 degrees plunge. The feeder zone was likely situated below a network of veins on the SE end of the orebody. The sickle-shaped outcrop of the deposit suggests a transcurrent, dextral opening of a WNW-ESE-striking <b>weakness</b> <b>zone</b> across the anorthosite pluton. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Karuma Hydropower Project was {{proposed}} {{to stave off}} prolonged energy shortage in Uganda. The project includes extensive underground works in mostly granitic gneiss bedrock. A {{first of its kind}} in the country, the project has suffered persistent funding challenges. A major cost driver for similar projects is uncertainty of engineering geology. In this study, Karuma Hydropower Project?s engineering geology and cost uncertainty arising from it were analysed. From a report of detailed geological investigations for the project; jointing, <b>weakness</b> <b>zones,</b> and distribution and character of rocks were described for each underground component. Thereafter, rock mass quality, rock stresses and their effect on excavation stability, and rock support by Q-method and numerical analysis were evaluated. Possible design improvements and feasibility of using NATM, NMT or TBM tunnelling were also assessed. A sequence for excavation of caverns {{was proposed}} as well. Consequently, excavation and rock support costs for the project were estimated; deterministically, and stochastically using Monte Carlo simulation. The study established that the project will be founded in medium quality rock mass (0. 1 <Q< 4). Minor tension in horizontal contours and <b>weakness</b> <b>zones</b> at six locations along the tailrace were the only rock stability concerns established. Modifying curvature of the transformer cavern?s roof to eliminate tensile failure and investigating a change of the tailrace?s alignment so as to avoid some <b>weakness</b> <b>zones</b> was proposed. NATM and NMT were recommended for tunnelling in soil and in rock respectively. For a potential 0. 5 billion NOK saving, further investigating TBM tunnelling for the long tailrace tunnels was recommended. Excavating the powerhouse cavern as a system of caverns was proposed to ease installation of the machine hall crane. Project costs for excavation and support of 1. 8 ? 2. 64 billion NOK with a mean of 2. 20 billion NOK were projected; implying uncertainty of &# 177; 20 %.

40|$|<b>Weakness</b> <b>zones</b> or faults {{containing}} {{swelling clay}} represent a challenging situation in hard rock tunnelling. When excavating in such zones, failures have occurred occasionally even though particular precautions have been taken. Instability has been encountered during tunnel excavation and sometimes also long after tunnel completion. One {{of the most}} recent cases of failure, the rock fall at the Hanekleiv road tunnel in southeast Norway, occurred ten years after tunnel completion. The rock fall was in a fault zone where swelling clay had been identified, about 1. 1 km from the northern tunnel entrance of the southbound tube. Cracks had been detected in the applied shotcrete at the fault zone during tunnel excavation. In one major <b>weakness</b> <b>zone</b> containing swelling clay at the Finnfast subsea tunnel, monitoring was carried out by the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI). Strain gauges and load cells were installed in the reinforced shotcrete rib near the crown and at springlines of the tunnel. The rock mass quality was estimated for the <b>weakness</b> <b>zones</b> of the two cases based on the Q classification system. However, it is hardly possible to characterize the complex conditions of <b>weakness</b> <b>zones</b> containing swelling clay with an empirical classification system. Except the important feature of the size (thickness) of zones, effects of swelling clay in <b>weakness</b> <b>zones</b> can not be fully accounted for in the system. Gouge materials were collected from the zones and mineral composition identified with X-ray diffraction analysis. Laboratory testing based on measuring the swelling pressure of remoulded specimens, and free swelling test were used to quantify the swelling potential. Numerical modelling is a powerful tool in rock engineering planning and design, particularly when difficulties and uncertainties are expected in the underground excavation. A three-dimensional program is normally preferred for the complicated engineering mechanical computation of tunnelling through weakness zones/faults. Inappropriate use of two-dimensional modelling may induce a large deviation in simulation results. The extent of deviation is illustrated with numerical simulation and comparison based on the two-dimensional finite element program Phase 2 and the threedimensional finite difference program FLAC 3 D. The instrumented <b>weakness</b> <b>zone</b> at the Finnfast subsea tunnel provides the opportunity to quantitatively evaluate the loading effects on reinforced shotcrete ribs. FLAC 3 D was used for this modelling, where the pore pressure distribution around the tunnel periphery after each blasting round was determined by using the ground water flow analysis. The full rock support (spiling bolts, shotcrete, radial bolts, face bolts, reinforced shotcrete ribs) applied during tunnel excavation was included in the model. The <b>weakness</b> <b>zone,</b> side rock and the rock support of sprayed concrete were simulated with the Mohr-Coulomb model. The spiling bolts, radial bots, face bolts and steel bars in the reinforced ribs of shotcrete were simulated with various built-in structural elements according to the loading characteristics. Different swelling pressures were applied on the rock support during simulation, ranging from zero to 0. 20 MPa at an interval of 0. 04 MPa. Though swelling pressure considerably increases the loading on rock support, all instrumentation data and simulation results show that the loading on the sprayed concrete is far less than its compressive strength. The loading on rock support was found to be much higher close to the excavation face, and this area is more critical in terms of tunnel stability. It was concluded that the rock fall at the Hanekleiv road tunnel was caused by a combination of swelling and gravitational collapse due to the very low internal friction. The swelling process most likely was caused by both the water from joints and accumulation of moisture behind the water/frost shielding, when ventilation has had little effect after tunnel completion. The strength of the rock mass was also reduced with absorption of water during the swelling process. Swelling and strength reduction gradually developed till the collapse suddenly took place. In the numerical simulation with FLAC 3 D, the fault zone and side rock were simulated based on the Mohr-Coulomb model. The strain softening model was used for shotcrete in order to simulate its post failure behaviour in consideration of the cracks detected during tunnel excavation. Three stages of mechanical states have been focused in the analysis. The first stage represented tunnel excavation and detection of cracks in the shotcrete. The swelling pressure on the rock support of shotcrete was considered at the second stage. Combined effects of strength reduction of the fault zone and swelling were simulated at the last stage. Simulation results verify both the detected cracks during tunnel excavation and the tunnel collapse. The swelling pressure, according to the analysis, had a limited influence on the shotcrete, while the strength reduction {{played an important role in}} the development of instability. Based on the analysis of swelling effects on rock support of the two cases, a flow chart of practical procedures for rock support estimation in weakness zones/faults containing swelling clay is recommended, in which the site investigation, laboratory testing and numerical simulation are integrated. Instrumentation and regular inspection for signs of instability are important for the stability control and back analysis. Further research on this issue is recommended to enrich the knowledge on tunnelling through such ground. PhD i geologi og bergteknikkPhD in Geology and Mineral Resources Engineerin...|$|R

New initiative from Bytunnelen AS and Sula municipal has resulted in new evaluations and afeasibility study of a sub-sea tunnel project under the Borgundfjord. This thesis is a continuation ofearlier project work of autumn, 2010. Engineering geological investigations and laboratory testing ofrock samples from the project area are used to assess important properties of the Borgundfjord subseatunnel project. Instability and water leakages in sub-sea tunnels can have disastrous consequences with potential loss of the entire tunnel construction due to the infinite water supply above. A total loss of a sub-seatunnel has yet to happen in Norway. Serious cases of water leakage have occurred in Norwegian tunneling history. The Oslofjord, Bjorøy and Frøya tunnel are examples of this. Comprehensive mitigation efforts were {{needed in order to}} keep up tunnel construction. These involved pre-injection grouting and freeze stabilization. Serious cave-in situations occurred in the Ellingsøy and the Atlanterhav tunnel. These cases were connected to unstable rock masses in <b>weakness</b> <b>zones,</b> near the low points of the tunnels. The tunnel heads needed a concrete plug in both cases, before careful blasting and support work could commence through the respective <b>weakness</b> <b>zones.</b> Planning phase engineering geological investigations are important in connection to tunnel placement, early cost predictions and construction time analysis. These assessments will often be based on numerous methods of investigations that clarify the general rock mass conditions of the project area and locations of possible <b>weakness</b> <b>zones.</b> An important investigation method, which is required in all sub-sea tunnel projects, is seismic measurement. Field investigations of the Borgundfjord tunnel project area was carried out over 2 days. Emphasis were on strike and dip measurements, tunnel portal locations and rock mass classifications using the RMR and Q-value system. The rock mass of the area has “fair” to “good” general quality. Different sub-areas of the entire project area show signs of 2 to 3 joint planes, together with the foliation plane in the rock mass. Three rock samples from the Borgundfjord project area were brought back to NTNU, for laboratory testing. The E-module, poissons ratio, sound velocity, point load and uniaxial compressive strength tests were carried out. The tested, intact rock parameters show signs of good quality rock. The Gneiss from Ålesund is a bit stronger than the Amphibolite and Eclogite, collected in Sula. Further evaluation on tunnel portal placement and tunnel alignments, together with results from field investigations form a basis for rock support amount estimations and cost analysis on two tunnel alternatives. A significant difference in length, cause the deeper tunnel alternative to get lower total costs. This, in addition to factors concerning potential leakage problems and issues of the tunnel portals, is the reason why this cheaper alternative is considered to be the best. Numerical modeling is useful when assessing the stability of an underground opening. The deepest point, in one of the tunnels, is modeled with and without the proposed rock support design. Values acquired from the laboratory tests were utilized in the analysis. The result of the modeling illustrate that the capabilities of the rock support will be sufficient in the critical <b>weakness</b> <b>zone.</b> </p...|$|R

Higher pools highlight a smooth surface and, at the bottom, sub-rounded pebbles and locally terra rossa. Moving seaward, rounded pebbles prevail and biochemical/biophysical weathering increases surface roughness. The surveying {{suggests that the}} genesis of the studied shore morphologies is strongly controlled by <b>geological</b> <b>weakness,</b> in fact they are mainly developed along joints and axis of folds and interested by marine factors; the surface morphology depends on their elevation.

40|$|International audienceNew {{combined}} {{structural and}} seismotectonic analyses demonstrate basement-involved shortening in forelands of recent collisional orogens (Taiwan, Western Alps, Pyrenees). Basement thrusts documented by seismicity (e. g., the 21 September 1999, Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan) and/or structural data are triggered and localized by preexisting basement faults which constitute crustal <b>weakness</b> <b>zones</b> available for reactivation under low stress levels. Reactivation of basement faults may induce localization of folds and thrusts {{in the shallow}} thrust wedge, development of crystalline thrust sheets, out-of-sequence basement thrusting and late basement uplift, deformation/ refolding of shallow thinskinned nappes, and development of accommodation structures such as transfer faults leading to a kinematic segmentation of foreland thrust belts. Reactivation of preexisting basement faults also occurs in the far foreland {{in response to the}} far-field transmission of orogenic stresses depending on the amount of the changing-through-time mechanical coupling between the orogen and its foreland. Displacements related to basement shortening in forelands are accommodated at the scale of the upper crust, which requires that it is partially decoupled from the deeper lithospheric levels by a crustal detachment. This detachment presumably occurs along the midcrustal, thermally weakened brittle-ductile transition. It may either ramp toward the surface into a shallow, upper crustal detachment beneath the fold-thrust belt and/or extend beneath the foreland and accommodate basin inversion far away from the orogen. Occurrence and relative timing of shallow and deep detachment tectonics in forelands seem to be dependent on mechanical boundary conditions such as the presence of ductile horizons within the cover sequence or of preexisting <b>weakness</b> <b>zones</b> in the underlying basement...|$|R
40|$|Affected by thermal {{perturbation}} due to mantle uprising, the rheological {{structure of}} the lithosphere could be modified, {{which could lead to}} different rifting patterns from shelf to slope in a passive continental margin. From the observed deformation style on the northern South China Sea and analogue modeling experiments, we rind that the rift zone located on the shelf is characterized by half grabens or simple grabens controlled mainly by long faults with large vertical offset, supposed to be formed with normal lithosphere extension. On the slope, where the lithosphere is very hot due to mantle upwelling and heating, composite grabens composed of symmetric grabens developed. The boundary and inner faults are all short with small vertical offset. Between the zones with very hot and normal lithosphere, composite half grabens composed of half grabens or asymmetric grabens formed, whose boundary faults are long with large vertical offset, while the inner faults are relatively short. Along with the thickness decrease of the brittle upper crust due to high temperature, the deformation becomes more sensitive to the shape of a pre-existing <b>weakness</b> <b>zone</b> and shows orientation variation along strike. When there was a bend in the pre-existing <b>weakness</b> <b>zone,</b> and the basal plate was pulled by a clockwise rotating stress, the strongest deformation always occurs along the middle segment and at the transition area from the middle to the eastern segments, which contributes to a hotter lithosphere in the middle segment, where the Baiyun (sic) sag formed.

40|$|Small-scale {{centrifuge}} {{models were}} used to investigate the role of continental rift structure in controlling patterns of magma migration and emplacement. Experiments considered the reactivation of <b>weakness</b> <b>zones</b> in the lower crust {{and the presence of}} magma at Moho depths. Results suggest that surface deformation, which reflects the <b>weakness</b> <b>zone</b> geometry, exerts a major control on patterns of magma migration. In the case of a single rift segment, the experimental lower crust and magma were both transferred in an extension-parallel direction toward the rift flanks. This lateral migration reflected the dominance of far-field stresses over extension-induced buoyancy forces. Local pressure gradients favored the raise of experimental magma in correspondence of marginal grabens. The lateral migration gave rise to major accumulations below the footwall of major boundary faults, providing the magma source able to feed off-axis volcanoes in nature, as inferred for the Main Ethiopian Rift. In the case of two offset rift segments, a major transfer zone developed. This transfer zone was characterized by prominent experimental lower crust doming and strong magma accumulation. Dynamic analysis showed that the transfer zone development caused a strong pressure difference in a rift-parallel direction, which dominated over the farfield thinning. Owing to this pressure gradient, almost all the underplated experimental magma collected below the lower crust dome, suggesting a rift-parallel (extension-orthogonal) migration. This process has a direct relevance for the localization of magmatic activity at transfer zones in natural continental rifts, such as in the Western Branch of the East African Rift System.

Investigation showed {{that prior to}} burial the porphyritic stones already possessed a complex legacy of <b>geological</b> <b>weaknesses</b> derived from hydrothermal alteration and tectonic deformation. Analysis indicated that significant alteration occurred during approximately 2000 years of burial under acidic peat cover, with development of a secondary porosity, alteration of primary minerals, {{and the opening of}} preexisting lines of weakness within the stones. Burial under peat also resulted in "bleaching" the stones so that they appeared white in color following excavation. These alterations during burial left the stones in a significantly weakened state and particularly susceptible to the effects of subaerial weathering processes. Data underline the potential fragility of excavated stonework and highlight the need to plan for its aftercare before complete excavation is undertaken. Â© 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

The river course north of Edebäck formed an ancient fjord after it became free of glacier ice and before the post-glacial rebound definitely raised the valley bottom above the sea. The river course south of Edebäck is possibly a Quaternary deflection caused by the accumulation of glacial deposits.|$|R

We herein present analog models specificallydesigned to explore the conditions (i. e., sharp increase of plate velocities — herein coined as ‘acceleration’,slab interaction with the 660 km discontinuity, ridge subduction) under which obduction may develop asa result of subduction initiation. The experimental setup comprises an upper mantle modeled as a low-viscosity transparent Newtonianglucosesyrup filling a rigid Plexiglas tank and high-viscosity silicone plates. Convergence is simulated bypushing a piston with plate tectonics like velocities (1 – 10 cm/yr) onto a model comprising a continentalmargin, a <b>weakness</b> <b>zone</b> with variable resistance and dip (W), an oceanic plate (with or without aspreading ridge), a preexisting subduction zone (S) dipping away from the piston and an upper activecontinental margin, below which the oceanic plate is being subducted {{at the start of}} the model (as forthe Neotethyan natural example). Several configurations were tested over thirty-five parametric models, with special emphasis oncomparingdifferent types of <b>weakness</b> <b>zone</b> and the degree of mechanical coupling across them. Measurements of displacements and internal deformation allow for a precise and reproducible trackingof deformation. Models consistently demonstrate that once conditions to initiate subduction are reached,obduction may develop further depending on the effective strength ofW. Results(1) constraintherange of physical conditions required for obduction to develop/nucleate and (2) underline the keyrole of such perturbations for triggering obduction, particularly plate ‘acceleration’. They provide anexplanation to the short-lived Peri-Arabic obduction, which took place along thousands of km almostsynchronously (within∼ 50 – 10 Myr), from Turkey to Oman, while the subduction zone beneath Eurasiabecame temporarily jammed.

Recent experimental data have also shown that the parent magma compositions of various anorthosite massifs lie on thermal highs in the relevant phase diagrams, indicating that these magmas cannot be derived by fractionation of peridotitic mantle melts but rather are produced by melting of gabbronoritic sources. In the Sveconorwegian province terrane boundaries have been traced in deep seismic profiles to Moho offsets or to tongues of lower crustal material underthrust to depths of 40 - 50 km. We therefore suggest that the parent magmas of anorthosite massifs are produced by melting of gabbronoritic rocks from the lower crust that had been thrust into the mantle by collision of terranes.
