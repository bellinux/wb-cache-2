Cables then interconnect the {{switches and}} <b>signal</b> <b>conditioners.</b> The switch matrix then employs a driver circuit and power supply to power and drive the switches and <b>signal</b> <b>conditioners.</b> The switch matrix uses connectors or fixtures to route the signal paths from the sourcing and measurement equipment to the DUT. The switch matrix is typically located close to the DUT to shorten the signal paths, thus reducing insertion loss and signal degradation.|$|R

40|$|<b>Signal</b> <b>conditioners</b> embodying {{advanced}} {{concepts in}} analog and digital electronic circuitry and software {{have been developed}} for use in data-acquisition systems that are required to be compact and lightweight, to utilize electric energy efficiently, and to operate with high reliability, high accuracy, and high power efficiency, without intervention by human technicians. These <b>signal</b> <b>conditioners</b> were originally intended for use aboard spacecraft. There are also numerous potential terrestrial uses - especially in the fields of aeronautics and medicine, wherein it is necessary to monitor critical functions. Going beyond the usual analog and digital signal-processing functions of prior <b>signal</b> <b>conditioners,</b> the new <b>signal</b> <b>conditioner</b> performs the following additional functions: It continuously diagnoses its own electronic circuitry, so that it can detect failures and repair itself (as described below) within seconds. It continuously calibrates itself {{on the basis of a}} highly accurate and stable voltage reference, so that it can continue to generate accurate measurement data, even under extreme environmental conditions. It repairs itself in the sense that it contains a micro-controller that reroutes signals among redundant components as needed to maintain the ability to perform accurate and stable measurements. It detects deterioration of components, predicts future failures, and/or detects imminent failures by means of a real-time analysis in which, among other things, data on its present state are continuously compared with locally stored historical data. It minimizes unnecessary consumption of electric energy. The design architecture divides the <b>signal</b> <b>conditioner</b> into three main sections: an analog signal section, a digital module, and a power-management section. The design of the analog signal section does not follow the traditional approach of ensuring reliability through total redundancy of hardware: Instead, following an approach called spare parts tool box, the reliability of each component is assessed in terms of such considerations as risks of damage, mean times between failures, and the effects of certain failures on the performance of the <b>signal</b> <b>conditioner</b> as a whole system. Then, fewer or more spares are assigned for each affected component, pursuant to the results of this analysis, in order to obtain the required degree of reliability of the <b>signal</b> <b>conditioner</b> as a whole system. The digital module comprises one or more processors and field-programmable gate arrays, the number of each depending on the results of the aforementioned analysis. The digital module provides redundant control, monitoring, and processing of several analog signals. It is designed to minimize unnecessary consumption of electric energy, including, when possible, going into a low-power "sleep" mode that is implemented in firmware. The digital module communicates with external equipment via a personal-computer serial port. The digital module monitors the "health" of the rest of the <b>signal</b> <b>conditioner</b> by processing defined measurements and/or trends. It automatically makes adjustments to respond to channel failures, compensate for effects of temperature, and maintain calibration...|$|R

40|$|A {{continuous}} capacitance sensor {{was developed}} and an analog <b>signal</b> <b>conditioner</b> was evaluated to demonstrate the acceptability of these items {{for use in the}} space shuttle propellant loading system. An existing basic sensor concept was redesigned to provide capability for cryogenic operation, to improve performance, and to minimize production costs. Sensor development verification consisted of evaluation of sensor linearity, cryogenic performance, and stability during vibration. The <b>signal</b> <b>conditioner</b> evaluation consisted mainly of establishing the effects of the variations in temperature and cable parameters and evaluating the stability. A sensor linearity of 0. 04 in. was achieved over most of the sensor length. The sensor instability caused by vibration was 0. 04 percent. The cryogenic performance data show a maximum instability of 0. 19 percent at liquid hydrogen temperature; a theoretical calibration can be computed a within 1 percent. The <b>signal</b> <b>conditioner</b> evaluation showed that, with temperature compensation, all error sources typically contribute much less than 1 percent. An estimate of the accuracy achievable with the sensor and <b>signal</b> <b>conditioner</b> shows an rss estimate of 0. 75 in. for liquid oxygen and 1. 02 in. for liquid hydrogen. These are approximately four times better than the shuttle requirements. Comparison of continuous sensor and discrete sensor performance show the continuous sensor to be significantly better when there is surface activity due to sloshing, boiling, or other disturbances...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to make the}} elctrocardiography (ECG) and the electromyography (EMG) signal conditioning circuits two-fault tolerant and to update the circuitry.
