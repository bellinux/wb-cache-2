5000|$|The {{production}} of containerboard {{is the highest}} {{of all kinds of}} paper in the world. More than 100 million tons are produced annually. It is made in specialized paper machines out of virgin as well as recycled fibers. Linerboard made of virgin pulp is called <b>kraftliner,</b> whereas recycled linerboard is known as testliner. The corrugating medium may be recycled medium, called wellenstoff in Europe, or virgin, which is called semichemical medium for the type of pulp used in its production. The borders of these categories become a little blurred, however, when both virgin and recycled fibers are used in making one product.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{potential}} for production of Fischer-Tropsch (FT) crude at a typical pulp and paper mill producing <b>kraftliner.</b> Heat integrated FT crude production, where excess heat from the FT crude process is used to produce steam for the mill’s steam network, is evaluated for different levels of mill heat demand. The paper presents performance indicators, including wood fuel-to-FT crude efficiency, greenhouse gas (GHG) balances and production cost for FT crude, for co-located production of <b>kraftliner</b> and FT crude. These results are compared to corresponding performance indicators for FT crude production heat integrated with a mill producing fine paper, and stand-alone FT crude production, presented by the authors in a previous study. The results show that a typical <b>kraftliner</b> mill, {{in contrast to a}} typical fine paper mill, has a net steam demand even if large investments are made in steam saving measures. A kraft pulp and paper mill with an annual production of 417, 000 ADt of <b>kraftliner</b> would need excess heat from an FT crude plant with 80 - 270 MW of wood fuel (LHV) input, depending on the heat demand at the mill. The wood fuel-to-FT crude efficiency, GHG emissions balances and production costs for FT crude are similar for heat integration in <b>kraftliner</b> and fine paper mill. The comparison of heat integrated and stand-alone FT crude production indicates higher wood fuel-to-FT crude efficiencies and lower production costs for heat integrated FT crude production. The reduction of GHG emissions is strongly affected by the assumed marginal electricity production technology, where heat integrated production benefits from low emitting electricity production technologies...|$|E
40|$|When customers’ {{demand of}} {{products}} increases, {{it will make}} companies to produce more and it will force them to expand their inventories. The company’s purpose is to produce customized products. The strive for the company should be to optimize the processes and different activities from supplier to customer. One of the necessary activities in the chain from production to customer is inventory and warehouse management {{and it should be}} in the company’s interest to do things right, to have high efficiency and not waste its resources. Smurfit Kappa <b>Kraftliner</b> Piteå, the company which this study has been made at, is one of Europe’s biggest <b>kraftliner</b> mill and producer of <b>kraftliner,</b> a base paper made from fresh fiber. Today the company has many inventories in its supply chain from suppliers to customers; among others at the harbor Haraholmen in Piteå, Sweden. The aim of this study has been to focus on the two warehouses in the harbor. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate current inventory layout and try to make it more efficient by studying the two inventories’ in- and outflow. Further, the manual handling of incoming orders was examined in order to suggest improvements. To fulfill the purpose of the study, interviews and observations were made at the harbor Haraholmen and at Smurfit Kappa <b>Kraftliner</b> Piteå. Also an automatized summary over incoming orders was programmed. Problems were identified from an analysis of the current situation. These problems were factors that contributed to the aim of this study. Some of these problems were the manual creation of a map of the warehouses and the summary of incoming orders, which contribute to inefficiency. As changes in order are incoming continuously, the map of the inventory has to be modified, which causes more work for the employees than necessary. Something else that was discovered was the fact that one of the two warehouses is smaller than the other. As the company today uses one warehouse per week, the risk of lack of space increases in the smaller one. Furthermore, it is important that the products are placed together in the warehouses based on their destination, diameters, and width. This is something that needs to be improved in order to make the loading and storekeeping more efficient. The recommendations, which have been developed during the study, are that Smurfit Kappa <b>Kraftliner</b> Piteå should place the articles more gathered, stack them higher, and use both inventories at the same time. This will eliminate the risk of the smaller inventory’s lack of space. Finally an automatized summary of incoming orders has been programmed to ease and make the employees’ work more effective with the map of the warehouses. Implementations of these recommendations will hopefully generate in a more efficient planning and storekeeping for Smurfit Kappa <b>Kraftliner</b> Piteå. Validerat; 20110704 (anonymous...|$|E

40|$|Silica is {{commonly}} used as an ingredient in the coatings of inkjet papers because of its capability to provide a coating layer structure combining a high pore volume, into which all the applied inkjet ink can transfer, and a suitable pore size distribution for very quick ink absorption. Nowadays, the production of silica pigment is quite expensive, and therefore, it would be advantageous to find a cheaper raw material source. In this study, the raw material was Greek olivine from magnesite mine sidestreams. The silica pigment was produced at laboratory scale by using nitric acid as a solvent. The target of this work was to clarify how this produced silica pigment is suited for inkjet coating pigments. The coating colors were applied by a laboratory rod coater on fine base paper and white-top <b>kraftliner,</b> and the coated surfaces were printed with a home and office area inkjet printer. The {{results showed that the}} produced olivine-based silica pigment has a potential in matt inkjet coatings. The coating of the produced silica pigment increased the print density, decreased the print-through, and diminished the bleeding of fine paper and white-top <b>kraftliner</b> board. However, further development work is needed to improve the pigment brightness to a more acceptable level, and to control the particle size at the nitric acid dissolution. </p...|$|E
40|$|In the Kraft process {{hemicelluloses}} {{are lost}} in the cooking procedure to the black liquor stream, which is subsequently burnt in the recovery boiler to recover cooking chemicals and to produce steam and energy. Hemicelluloses have a low heating value compared to lignin and therefore recovery of hemicelluloses at an earlier stage of the Kraft process followed by biochemical conversion into high value-added products might offer a much better economic opportunity. In collaboration with {{the research and development}} department of Smurfit Kappa <b>Kraftliner</b> AB, Piteå, Sweden, alkali and water extractions of birch wood were performed under conditions compatible with the Kraft process, at different times, temperatures and alkali charges. The extraction conditions were set in a range suitable with the current pulp process at Smurfit Kappa <b>Kraftliner.</b> The requirements for process configurations, based on either hot water or alkali extraction were also explored. The xylan yields from different extraction trials were measured and the chips from those extraction trials were cooked, refined and turned into sheets of paper. The effects on paper quality were compared with a reference pulp made from the same wooden chips. Recovered xylans from water extracted birch wood chips were subjected to secondary hydrolysis, enzymatic or sulphuric acid. Detoxification of the hydrolysate with active carbon and regulation of pH were performed before fermentation. Fermentation of the xylose hydrolysate to succinic acid was demonstrated by the use of the succinic acid producer Escherichia coli AFP 184.

40|$|In process {{industries}} {{a break in}} one of the processes in the chain of production can lead to severe consequences as the entire production flow will be stopped and thus the entire output. Therefore, maintenance of the machinery and availability of spare parts are two pertinent issues. In order to secure the latter, process-based companies purchase and build up a stock of spare parts that subsequently leads to high capital being tied up. At the company Smurfit Kappa <b>Kraftliner</b> in Piteå no consistent system has been worked out to handle the issue of storing spare parts. Today, the company stores spare parts together with other type of material and products. This leads to problems connected to the possibility of overlooking and maintaining the high level of service needed to keep spare parts available at all times for the manufacturing department {{and at the same time}} keep the value of the tied up capital as low as possible. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis is to study how spare parts in the paper industry should be systemized and structured to enable an effective management of spare parts, which would lead to a decrease regarding tied up capital? In order to achieve the purpose, the study started with an analysis of the current situation at the company. A theoretical framework was developed with a focus on logistics management, spare part management, standardization and cooperation. A benchmarking was also carried out by studying two other paper mills and their management of spare parts. The result of the study is concluded in five main recommendations aiming at reducing tied up capital regarding spare parts and their storage. The headlines of these recommendations are:- Standardized work and Knowledge transfer - ABC-Classification - An action plan to reduce tied up capital - Extended use of computer systems - To divide the storage in the computer system This thesis has partly been carried out at Smurfit Kappa <b>Kraftliner</b> Piteå so personnel at the company have continuously been involved in the study to help securing the applicability of the results.

40|$|As {{competition}} increases, {{companies have}} begun to identify their non-value adding activities in their processes to be more competitive on the market. This {{has made it possible}} for companies to compare and prioritize between different problems while various trends of quality costs can be found. Quality costs can be defined as the costs that could be avoided if the company's products or processes were perfect. A complaint starts when a customer's expectations to a product or service is not fulfilled. To create a good customer relationship {{it is important that the}} customer feels that the problem is taken seriously and that the company does their best to prevent the same thing happening again. For the company it is important that an accurate and comprehensive declaration is provided on all complaints to get a true overview of the problem. Current management of complaints at Smurfit Kappa <b>Kraftliner</b> can be improved both in management and accounting. An improvement would make it possible to shorten the processing time for warranty claims and the company would get more information from their assemblies. The goal of this thesis is to develop proposals for new procedures and work methods that contribute to the complaint process at Smurfit Kappa <b>Kraftliner</b> to become a more efficient process. In addition, any possible improvements on the current accounting of the complaints will be presented. To fulfill the purpose, the complaint process is mapped and the current accounting method has been identified. Through interviews and observations information has been gathered regarding the handling of complaints. This information has been analyzed based on the theory that deals with effectiveness of processes and quality costs. Furthermore, a literature review has been made in the field of quality and improvement efforts. The analysis showed that to achieve greater efficiency in the process, duplication of tasks and the potential for errors should be eliminated. In addition, standardized activities that make the process faster. A weakness was found in the accounting of complaints during the analysis of the current management that showed lack of possibilities to prioritize the complaints. Smurfit Kappa was recommended primarily to eliminate duplication of tasks in the process and reduce the probability of making mistakes. In addition, to further make the process more effective and to minimize the number of activities, the company can standardize their work. The accounting of claims can be improved by using Pareto charts, and from Pareto analysis quality defect parameters can be used to identify the fundamental problem of the complaint.

The information technology used in organizations has become essential, where intranets are {{a big part of}} it. Many organizations embrace social intranets, and these kind of changes has an impact on the members in the way they work, handle information and communicate. As many organizations and the members in it face new kinds of changes, they also face new kinds of challenges. This paper presents an interview study at Smurfit Kappa <b>Kraftliner</b> in Piteå, whom are about to go through a change process unlike any other change they have ever gone through before. For the first time, managers will with the help from an IT consultant firm change the intranet with an agile way of working towards a possibly social intranet. This study focuses on intranets, organizational change, agile ways of working and social intranets. The aim is to learn about the challenges that change process will meet. The respondents have different opinions about how much the change of intranet means as well as what outcome a social intranet would have in the organization. Conclusions have been made that the greatest challenge the managers have is to decide what exactly needs to be done and how it needs to be done. Also, the discrepancies between the respondents show that the intranet needs {{to be seen as a}} common concern throughout the whole organization to involve members and to make the change process successful. ...|$|E

The project {{assigned}} was to perform a change in their driving behaviour of the combustion air to the recovery boiler and eventually minimize problems with dust departure. The method of the experiments was to close the 1, 1 MPa steam and only inject 0, 3 MPa steam to the air preheater before injection into the recovery boiler. The purpose of the thesis was to analyse the experiments and evaluate if there are any negative consequences to run the plant with only 0, 3 MPa steam. The computer program WinMops was used to evaluate how the facility had been running earlier in the year and then compare this with the results of the experimental runs. The purpose of the recovery boiler is to recover chemicals by burning black liquor and to produce overheated steam to the turbines. The control and driving style of the recovery boiler is important for the black liquor combustion to be optimal. The combustion depends on the composition of the black liquor and the combustion air that is added. With the right amount of air and in the right places, you can control how well the combustion will be depending on the composition of the black liquor. Therefore, the combustion air is inserted to the recovery boiler at four different levels. Combustion tests were performed on two occasions, 24 hours each, and resulted in many negative consequences. The degree of reduction of green liquor and outgoing steam quantity was reduced. The amount of air into the boiler increased when the air pressure went down as the temperature of the combustion air was lowered from 170 °C to 132 °C. Increased amount of air in the boiler led to increased amount of fumes, which had a negative effect on the dust departure. The conclusion from this study is that the problems of high dust departure continued even with the changed driving behaviour of the combustion air. The conditions for combustion experiments have not been optimal when a number of breakdowns occurred in the steam network. The results probably had become more reliable with longer trial periods because the black liquor composition varies from day to day. ...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{savings and}} {{increased}} efficiency {{is important to}} a large energy consuming industry such as the pulp and paper industry. To give industries incentives {{to do something about}} their energy consumption, policy instruments are used and research in the pulp and paper field show that large savings can be achieved. One way to save steam is process integration and a tool to find steam saving opportunities is pinch analysis. The method is used in this thesis where a pinch analysis of a modelled average Scandinavian <b>Kraftliner</b> mill has been done. The mill is modelled within the national research program FRAM (Future Resource Adapted Pulp Mill) and the results in this thesis might act as a guideline for possible steam saving opportunities for a mill of this size and type. The pinch analysis shows that theoretically, 20 MW of steam can be saved through improved heat exchanging, which is about 11 % of today’s steam demand. By making a retrofit analysis, two steam saving proposals with possibility to save 13. 7 and 19. 6 MW of low pressure steam were worked out. Other investigated steam saving alternatives were flue gas heat recovery, upgrading of the evaporation plant, and energy savings in the paper machine. The steam saving opportunities were put together to eight different investment alternatives with steam savings between 120 and 420 GWh/yr. The economic evaluation of those alternatives shows an investment cost in the range 1 – 15 M€, depending on the investment. The largest investment cost is an upgrade of the evaporation plant, 10. 4 M€. The steam surplus can be used for fuel savings and thereby achieve annual earnings. To analyze this, two levels of bark and electricity prices were used and the resulting earnings lie between 2. 5 – 10 M€/yr depending on investment alternative, bark and electricity prices. An interesting concept within process integration and the biorefinery field is lignin separation. In this thesis it is investigated what lignin price is required for lignin to be equally profitable as saving fuel. The same levels of fuel and electricity prices as for the fuel savings were used and consequently two lignin price levels were achieved. The achieved lignin prices vary between 30 and 51 €/MWh. Depending on the investment alternative and thereby achieved lignin price, this is comparable to the price of high-grade biofuels as well as the oil price. Conclusions that can be drawn are; considerable savings can be achieved in the mill, it is clearly profitable to save fuel and the estimated lignin price implies that lignin separation can be an interesting alternative to fuel saving...|$|E
40|$|Models of the {{nonlinear}} creep {{behavior of}} paper, {{and of the}} global buckling, local buckling and creep buckling of corrugated board have been developed. The studies of creep and buckling were limited to climate conditions with constant relative humidity. First the short-term elastic buckling of corrugated board panels was studied. Then an appropriate creep equation, based on the Schapery representation, for liner and fluting materials was developed and implemented in a finite element code to study creep buckling and time to failure of a corrugated board panel axially loaded in compression. Experimental tensile creep-recovery tests of 300 g/m 2 <b>kraftliner</b> (used for the facing of corrugated boards) and 150 g/m 2 semi-chemical testliner (used for the fluting) at 50, 70 and 90 %RH were made by a special designed tensile creep tester. Compression creep-recovery tests at 50 %RH was made using a compression creep tester developed at STFI. For the short-term loading case, the experimental global buckling and postbuckling deformation performance of a corrugated board panel {{was found to be}} in good agreement with the performance predicted by FE-calculation. The calculated local buckling load was however almost 2. 5 times higher than the experimentally observed local buckling load in the panel. This discrepancy between the experimental and calculated local buckling load was most probably due to development of global buckling before local buckling of the panel. For the long-term loading case, the Schapery equation was found to give a good representation of the creep behavior of the facing and fluting material and enabled reasonably accurate predictions of the creep behavior of corrugated board. The Schapery representation for paper was implemented in the finite element codes Ansys and Abaqus. In Ansys, the Schapery representation was described by using stress-strain isochrounes and failure of the material was considered by using a Tsai-Wu failure criterion based on a time independent failure strain in the CD and MD at each layer. This model with isochrounes and a material failure criterion was found to be suitable for calculating failure load for a given time to failure. In the calculations made by the finite element code Abaqus no simplification was made of the Schapery representation and no material failure criterion was used. This model is more accurate than the model with isochrounes stress-strain curves {{in the sense that the}} influence of stress redistribution on the creep is considered. The model is therefore suitable to study the creep strains of a corrugated board structure as function of time, both the in-plane strains and pre-failure out-of-plane displacements. The creep buckling analysis was verified by tests. It was found that the experimental out-of-plane displacement of the mid-node of a panel under compression load was in good agreement with the calculated out-of-plane displacement...|$|E
40|$|Sweden {{has a large}} mining {{industry}} compared {{to the rest of}} Europe that results in large amounts of mine waste that must be taken care of in an environmentally and economically sustainable way. The mine waste consist of either of waste rock, that is unmineralized/uneconomic that have to be mined for practical reasons to get access to the ore, or tailings, which is a waste product from the enrichment process. The most common oretype to be mined is metal sulfide ore, out of 13 active metal ore mines in the end of 2009 sulfide ore was mined in 11 mines. The sulfide ore often have a metal content of a few percent that results in large amounts of tailings. The tailings are stored in large deposits at the mine site and when the tailings are exposed to oxygen in the air the sulfides in the tailings oxidize. The oxidation of sulfide minerals creates acid mine drainage with high metal content and is considered to be harmful to health and environment. In combination with Sweden’s more and more strict environmental legislation the demands have increased on the {{mining industry}} to find good and sustainable solutions to prevent oxidation of sulfide rich tailings. At the same time the heavy industry has become affected by increased costs for landfilling of non-recyclable wastes and has therefore started to search for new alternatives for reusing the waste instead of landfilling it. Two types of wastes that have become interesting to use as cover materials for landfills and tailing deposits are green liquor dregs and fly ashes. To evaluate how green liquor dregs and fly ash ages when used as cover materials in landfills the Rönnskär processing plant and smelter placed two covers on their tailings deposits as pilot study in 2006. One of the covers consisted of green liquor dregs from Smurfit Kappa <b>Kraftliner</b> AB and the other cover consisted of fly ashes from Skellefteå Kraft AB. This study is an evaluation of the two covers after being in use for 5 years. Due to a high water saturation degree both of the covers can be considered to decrease oxygen diffusion to the tailings via air. This has resulted in an oxygen level in the covers to be low according to the mobility of the elements interpreted from the chemical analysis. The covers also have a chemical impact on the tailings where the most noticeable change is the pH. The pH in the tailings under the covers have increased from ca pH 2 to ca pH 3 - 6 compared to the tailings without cover. The covers also {{have a negative impact on}} the tailings where the highest impact is that Zn is leaching from the covers and accumulated in the tailings below. Seen from a technical point of view the green liquor dregs and the fly ashes is not clearly suitable as covers since there are some qualities, for example permeability, that can be improved. But the materials does have several qualities that makes them suitable, for example water saturation degree, buffer capacity etc., and these qualities in combination with how the materials reacts to ageing gives room for additional studies for the purpose of making the materials more suitable to be used as covers.
