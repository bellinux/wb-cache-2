40|$|Summary. <b>Belt</b> <b>dryers,</b> {{using in}} the food industry, are {{inferior}} in many technical and economic indices foreign counterparts due to low technical level. The aim of the work {{was to develop a}} methodology for calculating <b>belt</b> <b>dryers</b> with active hydrodynamic regime on the basis of theoretical and experimental data on the kinetics and hydrodynamics. The executed calculation allowed to design the <b>belt</b> <b>dryer</b> with an active hydrodynamic mode. The offered dryer has the following advantages: high operational reliability {{due to the lack of}} numerous cycles of deformation and a considerable abrasion of mesh plates; achievement of uniform drying of a product owing to use of soft, sparing modes of oversleeping and hashing at the maximum preservation of particles of a processed product at the expense of a rational design of a gravitational device for agitating; universalization of a design of the dryer and its adaptation for drying of various products, differing physicomechanical properties (a corner of a natural slope, granulometric structure, adhesion, etc.); lack of need for readjustment of a design of the dryer for the products, differing physicomechanical properties (a corner of a natural slope, granulometric structure, adhesion, etc.); use of a being poured layer reduces a balling of a dried-up product and prevents formation of agglomerates...|$|R

First, the drying properties of ThO$_{ 2 }$-(Th, U) O$_{ 2 }$ and UO$_{ 2 }$ gel particles were examined and a <b>belt</b> <b>dryer</b> for continuous drying was developed using the findings obtained.

50|$|A <b>Belt</b> <b>dryer</b> / <b>Belt</b> cooler is {{a device}} {{designed}} for the particularly gentle thermal treatment of product. The wet product is continuously and evenly applied through an infeed chamber onto a perforated belt. The belt, predominantly in horizontal position, carries the product through the drying area which is divided into several sections. In these cells drying gas flows through or over the wet product and dries it. Each cell can be equipped with a ventilating fan and a heat exchanger. This modular design allows the drying and cooling temperatures to be controlled separately in the different sections. Thus, each dryer cell can be individually controlled and the drying / cooling air flow can be varied in each cell. In addition, {{the speed of the}} conveyor belt can be varied what gives an additional parameter for setting of drying time.The cells can be heated or cooled directly or indirectly, and all heating media, such as oil, steam, hot water or hot gas can be used.Belt dryers are ideally suited to drying almost any non-flowing product or more granular products that require a lower throughput capacity.|$|R

Drying experiments using the three different temperatures and two drying air velocities were performed for the sugar cubes with 3 % of the initial moisture content. Thus, on the basis of drying curves the regression analysis was made to obtain diffusion coefficient. Thereafter the 2 D simulation of one sugar cube was modeled by using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software ANSYS FLUENT.

40|$|Combustion or {{gasification}} of high-moisture content biomass {{is associated}} with a number of drawbacks, such as operational instabilities and lowered total efficiency. The present work proposes an integrated <b>dryer</b> and conveyor <b>belt</b> for woody biofuels with steam as the heat transfer medium. The use of low-temperature steam is favorable from a heat management point of view, but also helps to minimize the risk of fire, self-ignition and dust explosions. Furthermore, the presented dryer design represents an efficient combination of fuel transport, drying equipment and fuel feeding system. The proposed design is developed from a macroscopic energy and mass balance model that uses results from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) fuel bed modeling and experiments as its input. This CFD simulation setup can be further used to optimize the design with respect to bed height, steam injection temperatures and fuel type. The macroscopic model can be used to investigate the integration of the dryer within a larger biomass plant. Such a case study is also presented, where the dryer is tailored for integration within an indirect steam gasification system. It is found that the exergy efficiency of this dryer is 52. 9 %, which is considerably higher than those of other dryers using air or steam, making the proposed drying technology a very competitive choice for operation with indirect steam gasification units. </p...|$|R

This route facilitates, for example, more advanced electricity generation and production of biomass based transportation fuels or chemical feedstock. Each unit operation in such a process affects overall efficiency as well as possibilities for process integration. In this paper, the impact of different dryer types in a biomass gasification combined cycle (BIGCC) has been evaluated in terms of efficiency and economic performance. The BIGCC was sized so that the excess heat would replace the current steam production from bark and oil. The {{results show that the}} dryer type can {{have a significant impact on}} economic performance and efficiencies. A BIGCC with an integrated <b>belt</b> <b>dryer,</b> utilizing excess heat to heat the drying air from the mill, can result in electrical efficiencies of up to around 40 %, while e. g. a steam dryer can reach 36 e 37 %. Choice of oxidant, air or oxygen, in the gasifier affects both capital and operational cost. Air was proven to be the most cost efficient solution for the cases evaluated in this study. The investment of around 100 to 140 million Euros for a BIGCC facility is profitable for most evaluated cases for an annuity factor of 0. 1, while the net annual profit is negative for most cases when the annuity factor was increased to 0. 2, even when including financial support for renewable electricity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{pros and}} cons of various types of biomass dryers have been {{documented}} in this paper. Using dry biomass significantly reduces the cost of handling, transportation and pyrolysis. The main choices for drying biomass are rotary dryers, flash dryers, stationery bed dryers and fluidised bed dryers. The drying medium can be hot air, hot air mixed with steam, and/or superheated steam. A typical example for wood chip drying using a financial model is described, including the environmental performance. The energy requirements and greenhouse gas emissions have been estimated for drying biomass. From this study, it is evident that increasing temperature will decrease drying time and increase throughput but not necessarily decrease the drying cost. This is due to higher energy use and higher cost of capital inputs such as loading/unloading and heat plant. Thus, low drying temperature can be used if throughput is not a key issue for an operation. The global warming potential of the biomass drying process 9. 2 kg CO 2 -e/t of oven-dry biomass. This assumes that wood waste is used as fuel and drying is on a moving <b>belt</b> <b>dryer.</b> If this dry biomass is used in a power station as fuel for steam boiler, there is a significant reduction potential of CO 2 emission from a typical black coal-fired power plant due to fuel switching. This assumes that trees are planted to produce this biomass sustainably. Environmental impacts of any dryer type should be considered for selection in addition to its traditional techno-economic performance...|$|R
40|$|The major {{phenomena}} {{involved in}} the drying of calcium lactate in a spray dryer are discussed: evaporation, crystallization and agglomeration. Tests have been done on the following types of spray dryers: a conventional dryer at high temperature (HTD), a conventional dryer at low temperature (LTD), a fluid bed dryer (SDA) and a <b>belt</b> <b>dryer</b> (FILTERMAT). The influence of process conditions on the above phenomena is studied as well the interactions between those phenomena. Completely crystallized calcium lactate contains 27 % moisture as a part ofthe crystal lattice. Water {{that is not a}} part of the crystal lattice is called "free moisture content" and contributes highly to the stickiness of a particle and hence to agglomeration. If the evaporation is too fast, crystallization will be hindered and an amorphous calcium lactate with a lot of free moisture will cause the particles to stick to the wall, to agglomerate and hence to block the dryer. The dryers diSFer in residence time. A combmation of slow evaporation and a long residence time give the best crystallization results and hence httle stickiaess. In all dryers product or off-gas particles are retumed by blowing them around the feed inlet. These particles serve as nuclei for crystallization. A drying curve of calcium lactate has been determined and gives evidence of the fact that the drying of calcium lactate ia a spray dryer is a heat limited process. A simple mathematical model is presented which describes the drying of calcium lactate in a FILTERMAT dryer chamber, only with respect to evaporation. Numerical simulations with this model in PSI/e give reasonable results and support the experimental finding that heat transport is a limiting factor id the drying of calcium lactate.

40|$|Annual {{production}} {{of sewage sludge}} in Europe is estimated at more than eleven million tons of dry matter content [1]. Use in agriculture and incineration are the main ways of valorization. In this context, drying of residual sludge appears as an essential step after mechanical dewatering. It reduces the costs of storage, transport and allows the sludge stabilization. However, this process is highly energy consuming and {{still needs to be}} optimized as it constitutes an important economic and environmental issue [2]. Polymers are usually employed in the conditioning step in order to promote particle aggregation, making the dewatering easier. The past decades, the application of pre-hydrolized polyaluminium chlorides (PACls) as coagulant has increased, particularly in China, Japan, Russia and Western Europe [3]. As a consequence, PACls are extensively investigated for their coagulation performance, characterization and speciation [3]. In this work, the influence of Polyaluminium chloride (PAX- 14) co-conditioning with linear polyelectrolytes on sludge dewatering and drying performances was investigated. Experiments were conducted on activated sludge samples collected after thickening from the wastewater treatment plant of the Grosses- Battes (Belgium). Two cationic polymers were tested, each of them in combination with PAX for sludge flocculation prior to mechanical dewatering and their effects on sludge convective drying. The one referenced as 640 LH was a linear polymer with a low molecular weight, whereas the 640 CT was a linear one with a high molecular weight. After conditioning, the dewatering step was realized by using a normalized filtration-expression cell (AFNOR 1979) under 5 bar of pressure. Then, the specific resistance to filtration was determined from the follow-up of filtrate mass with time, using the Carman-Kozeny equation [4]. Figure 1 shows the experimental design. For convective drying experiments, the cake recovered after filtration was extruded through a circular die of 14 mm diameter and cut at a height of 14 mm, yielding cylindrical samples with mass of approximately 2. 5 g, as used in several industrial <b>belt</b> <b>dryers.</b> Individual extrudates have been dried in a specially designed convective micro-dryer. Results reported in this paper were obtained with the following operating conditions: air temperature of 130 °C, at ambient humidity (absolute humidity ~ 0. 005 kgwater/ kgdry air) and a superficial velocity of 1 m/ s. Results show that, the dry solids content of the dewatering cake increases with increasing Polyaluminium chloride dosage for both series of experiments. It supposes that PAX contributed to improve solids capture, depicted on Fig. 2. Concerning drying, it appeared that the samples treated by the dual PAX/ polymers combination showed higher drying rates than samples conditioned by polymer without PAX addition, allowing a reduction of the drying time (see Fig. 3). Table 1 shows the drying characteristics of the samples. The drying time decreases and the average drying rate increases with the dual conditioners addition, while the initial water content decreases as well as the total amount water to be removed.
