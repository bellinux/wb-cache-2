25|$|Twist lifts are {{a form of}} pair lifts, {{where the}} lifted partner is thrown into the air, twists, and is caught by the lifted partner. The lady is caught by her waist {{in the air and}} lands on the {{backward}} outside edge. Some pairs include a split before rotating. This is credited as a difficult feature if each leg is separated by at least a 45° angle from the body axis and the legs are straight or almost straight. Scores are also affected by the height of the twist, turns, steps or other moves before the element, the lady holding <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> her head, delayed rotation, etc.|$|E
500|$|In chapter 37 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, Gerðr is {{introduced}} by the enthroned figure of High {{as the daughter of}} Gymir and the mountain jötunn Aurboða, and is described as [...] "the most beautiful of all women". High reports that Freyr went into Hlidskjalf and looked over all worlds. When Freyr looked to the north he saw a distant homestead with a large and magnificent building. A woman went to the building, and when she lifted her arms and {{opened the door to the}} building [...] "light was shed from <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> both sky and sea, and all worlds were made bright by her". In punishment for [...] "his great presumption" [...] in having sat in the holy seat, Freyr went away filled with grief.|$|E
60|$|She {{suddenly}} {{held out}} both <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> the breakfast-table.|$|E
60|$|She kneeled {{down beside}} it, passed <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> his neck, and drew {{his face to}} hers. She knew that he only feigned to be asleep, but she said nothing to him.|$|R
6000|$|She put <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder, {{and touched}} the plaster on his neck gently with her finger. [...] "There's one thing I don't doubt," [...] she said: [...] "the Captain did that!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oswald," [...] {{said his}} wife, getting up, and putting <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder, [...] "you {{know you would}} give your best horse to Mr. Finn, {{as long as he}} chose to stay here, though you rode upon a donkey yourself." ...|$|R
60|$|When Phoebe {{had retired}} to the kitchen, presumably for {{additional}} supplies, Miriam stretched <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> the table.|$|E
60|$|She {{pushed the}} tangled {{hair from her}} forehead, {{mechanically}} readjusting her cumbersome garments, then she stepped close up to the young Spaniard; she crossed <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> her breast and looked him boldly in the eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... [An interval. She spasmodically flings <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> {{her son and}} [...] daughter, {{lets them}} fall, and becomes unconscious. They fetch a [...] looking-glass, and find that her {{breathing}} has ceased. The clock [...] of the Chateau strikes noon. The scene is veiled.] ...|$|E
60|$|They parted with {{an embrace}} {{that would have}} {{fortified}} older married people for a year's separation. When Bartley came back, she handed him the leaf she had torn out of his book, and sat down beside him while he read it, with <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Jim stared, grinning, {{showing his}} pointed teeth, {{reaching}} nearer and nearer to Clariss who, in her frail scrap {{of an evening}} dress, amethyst and silver, was sitting still in the deep black hearth-rug, <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> Julia's knee, taking very little notice of Jim, although he amused her.|$|R
60|$|She turned; <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> fell <b>over</b> his shoulder; she {{buried her}} head in his breast.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! Sibby said he {{just stood}} in the doorway, lifted his hat as the funeral passed and then well-nigh carried Mamma, with the baby (that was Fulbert) in <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> <b>over</b> the threshold, and smiled at her, saying, [...] "Well, mother, what better than to have found our home till death!" [...] So you see he did believe in it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{laid her}} cigar aside like Amelius, and crossed <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> her bosom, {{and looked at}} him, with the first {{softening}} gleam of tenderness {{that he had seen}} in her face. [...] "My friend," [...] she said, [...] "yours will be a sad life--I pity you. The world will wound that sensitive heart of yours; the world will trample on that generous nature. One of these days, perhaps, you will be a wretch like me. No more of that. Get up; I have something to show you." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{struggle}} rent her heart. Could she forgive? Oh! {{could she}} forgive him who had slain them all? Now {{she was aware}} that the place {{was filled with the}} points of light that were Spirits, and that every one of them looked at her awaiting the free verdict of her heart. Rank upon rank, also, the mighty Shapes gathered about her, and in their arms her dead, and all of them looked and looked, awaiting the free verdict of her heart. Then it arose within her, drawn how she knew not from every fibre of her infinite being, it arose within her, that spirit of pity and of pardon. As the dead had stretched out their arms above her, so she stretched out <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> the head of that tortured soul, {{and for the first time}} her lips were given power to speak.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, {{there it}} is! She had burnt {{up a lot}} o' stuff, then took to bed with the child. She rolled her up in all the quilts an' shawls an' dresses they was in the house; then laid down {{by the side of}} her, an' put <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> her--an' froze--jes' like a mother--no judgment!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm awful tired. It's awful cold. My feet hurt awfully. Carl dear, oh, pleassssse {{take me home}} now. I want my mamma. Maybe she won't whip me now. It's so dark and--ohhhhhh----" [...] She muttered, incoherently: [...] "There! By the road! He's {{waiting for}} us!" [...] She sank down, <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> face, groaning, [...] "Don't hurt me!" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{stopped for}} a moment, <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> {{tightened}} <b>over</b> <b>her</b> bosom, and she laughed to herself--a hard, harsh, angry laugh.|$|R
6000|$|The superb {{success of}} this last {{offering}} excited Teddy to such a degree, that he first threw his lamb into the conflagration, and before it had time even to roast, he planted poor Annabella on the funeral pyre. Of course {{she did not like}} it, and expressed her anguish and resentment in a way that terrified her infant destroyer. Being covered with kid, she did not blaze, but did what was worse, she squirmed. First one leg curled up, then the other, in a very awful and lifelike manner; next she flung <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> her head as if in great agony; her head itself turned on her shoulders, her glass eyes fell out, and with one final writhe of her whole body, she sank down a blackened mass on the ruins of the town. This unexpected demonstration startled every one and frightened Teddy half out of his little wits. He looked, then screamed and fled toward the house, roaring [...] "Marmar" [...] {{at the top of his}} voice.|$|E
5000|$|The {{image is}} {{considered}} {{as one of the}} greatest sacred symbols in Ukraine, a palladion defending the people of the country. It has been called an [...] "Indestructible Wall" [...] or [...] "Unmoveable Wall". Legend says that as long as the Theotokos is extending <b>Her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> Kiev, the city will stand indestructible.|$|E
5000|$|In some twists, {{the lady}} {{performs}} a split before rotating. This is credited as a difficult feature if each leg is [...] "at least 45° {{from the body}} axis and her legs are straight or almost straight." [...] Other variations which may increase the score include steps or other skating moves going into the twist, delayed rotation, or the lady holding <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> her head.|$|E
6000|$|... "What?" [...] he exclaimed, {{looking up}} {{suddenly}} at her taunt. She {{knew she was}} playing false; she put the ring on her finger and went {{across the room to}} Leslie, laying <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder, and leaning her head against him, murmuring softly to him. He, poor fellow, was delighted with her, for she did not display her fondness often.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{thinking}} more, papa, of you," [...] she said putting <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder. [...] "You {{have always been}} so good to me, and so kind!" [...] Here his heart misgave him, for he felt that {{during the last week}} he had not been kind to her. [...] "But you would not wish me to give myself to a man and then not to care for him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So it's settled, Augusta, is it?" [...] said she; [...] "the {{first of}} September. I wish you joy {{with all my}} heart," [...] and, coming round, she put <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> Augusta's {{shoulder}} and kissed her. The Lady Alexandrina could not but think that the doctor's niece uttered her congratulations very much {{as though she were}} speaking to an equal; very much as though she had a father and mother of her own.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{even smaller}} panels each depict a female figure with a halo on a plain golden background, with {{cypresses}} {{on either side}} of them, symbolising the Garden of Eden. According to their inscriptions they represent the Virtues of [...] "η αλιθηα" [...] (ἡ ἀλήθεια, Sincerity) and [...] "η ταινοσις" [...] (ἡ ταπείνωσις, Humility). Sincerity holds a cross in one hand and points to her mouth, while Humility crosses <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> her chest.|$|E
50|$|Twist lifts are {{a form of}} pair lifts, {{where the}} lifted partner is thrown into the air, twists, and is caught by the lifted partner. The lady is caught by her waist {{in the air and}} lands on the {{backward}} outside edge. Some pairs include a split before rotating. This is credited as a difficult feature if each leg is separated by at least a 45° angle from the body axis and the legs are straight or almost straight. Scores are also affected by the height of the twist, turns, steps or other moves before the element, the lady holding <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> her head, delayed rotation, etc.|$|E
5000|$|Dec {{found it}} very {{frustrating}} when the callers could not get the answer right (while sometimes also submitting guesses that didn't rhyme), and would sometimes throw the toy and the stand it was placed on in (mock) anger, or ranting into the camera, which became a staple occurrence and sparked his catchphrase for the game, [...] "It's Gotta Rhyme!". The hosts' continued frustration led to them filming a pre-recorded round of the game, with an answer of [...] "Pat Cat" [...] (the clue being host Cat Deeley rubbing <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> her back). The fictional contestant {{made a number of}} unrelated guesses, including constantly repeating [...] "Feely Deeley" [...] even when informed it was incorrect numerous times.|$|E
60|$|Barbara gave <b>her</b> <b>arm,</b> and <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} threw a swift {{smile at}} Mrs. Noel, {{who did not}} answer it, but stood looking quietly after them, her eyes immensely dark and large.|$|R
50|$|She led the Indian team to {{the finals}} in the 2005 Women's Cricket World Cup where the team lost to Australia. She is a {{part-time}} leg-break bowler as well. She is a recipient of the Arjuna award for the year 2003. She currently tops the batting table with 703 ratings. Her composure when at the crease and ability to score briskly make her a dangerous cricketer. In addition to her ability with the bat, Mithali rolls <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> bowling leg-spinners and providing variety to the attack.|$|R
5000|$|Cuddle, (also called Wrap Position or Sweetheart’s Wrap): The gent {{wraps his}} right arm around the lady’s waist; she wraps <b>her</b> left <b>arm</b> around <b>her</b> front to hold his right hand. She wraps <b>her</b> right <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> left <b>arm</b> and across <b>her</b> front to hold his left hand. Hands are at waist level.|$|R
5000|$|A twist lift, {{an element}} {{found only in}} pair skating, is a move that begins with the man {{assisting}} the lady in an Axel or toe-assisted jump where she rotates and is caught mid-air by the man, who then places her down back on the ice. In some twists, the lady performs a split before rotating. This is credited as a difficult feature if each leg is [...] "at least 45° from the body axis and her legs are straight or almost straight." [...] A few pairs perform a nearly 180° degree split before rotating. A pair may also achieve a higher score with a difficult entrance, delayed rotation, or if the lady holds <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> her head while rotating.|$|E

5000|$|Maekawa {{is another}} of Makoto's classmates who is very tall for a girl (she claims to be 179.9 cm tall) and always refers to Makoto as 'transfer student' as she can never get his name right. She later says that its kind of {{embarrassing}} for her {{to change the way}} she addresses Makoto(It is hinted that she has feelings for Makoto). She is very calm and sometimes expressionless perhaps due to having a weak body and sometimes amuses herself by teasing Ryūko. She gets dizzy if she raises <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> her head for more than ten seconds, and often wears various costumes. Her parents own a bar in the shopping district and she has several part-time jobs. She insists on wearing cosplay to work even when her supervisor insists her not to.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A rare {{sample of}} Egyptian terra cotta {{sculpture}} which may depict Isis mourning Osiris. The sculpture portrays a woman raising <b>her</b> right <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> head, a typical gesture of mourning. Musée du Louvre, Paris.|$|R
5000|$|Cuddle or Wrap Position (also called Sweetheart or Sweetheart’s Wrap): The gent {{wraps his}} right arm around the lady’s waist; she wraps <b>her</b> left <b>arm</b> around <b>her</b> front to hold his right hand.
