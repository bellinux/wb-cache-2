40|$|AbstractThe {{influences}} of thickness ratio of base sheets on formability of {{tailor welded blanks}} were examined based on Erichsen cupping tests. Three-dimensional finite element (FE) models, using Hillâ€™ 48 yield criterion and iso-hardening rule, were built under {{the environment of the}} FE analysis software ABAQUS. The failure onset sites of tailor welded blanks were analysed and the quantitative relationships between the <b>Erichsen</b> <b>index</b> values and base thickness ratio were established. Based on these relationships, the formability of tailor welded blanks made from dissimilar base sheets are evaluated, provided that the <b>Erichsen</b> <b>index</b> values of tailor welded blanks made from identical ones are known and that the above two different types of tailor welded blanks undergo a similar stamping process. The experiments were then carried out to validate this method...|$|E
