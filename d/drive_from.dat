5|$|The mid-engine {{complicated}} {{the design of}} the four-wheel drive system, and an innovative solution was needed to get <b>drive</b> <b>from</b> the rear of the engine to the front wheels. The chosen design took the front-wheel <b>drive</b> <b>from</b> the central differential on the rear transaxle and sent it through the V in the centre of the engine using a quill drive, before joining an inverted differential. The clutch was a twin-plate unit designed by AP Racing.|$|E

By 1957, it was possible to <b>drive</b> <b>from</b> New York City to Chicago without encountering a traffic signal.|$|E

5|$|Ideal batting {{conditions}} and clear skies greeted {{the players on}} the second morning. Barnes batted assuredly, while Morris was hesitant and shuffled around the crease.

Barnes picked the ball off the wicket and handed it to the bowler, prompting Chester to wag his finger in disapproval. Barnes responded by admonishing the umpire for blocking the ball.|$|E

5|$|LSU {{received}} {{the ball to}} start the second half and started their fifth offensive <b>drive</b> <b>from</b> their own 18. After they gained a first down on a short pass {{on a pair of}} runs, the Alabama defense stopped the Tigers on their next series to force a punt. Alabama then started from their own 48, but were only able to muster a three and out. This resulted in their first punt of the night from Cody Mandell. With Lee back at quarterback for LSU, he threw his second interception, this time to Mark Barron, to give Alabama possession at the LSU 35. Again the LSU defense held the Alabama offense in check to set up another long field goal attempt. This time Foster connected on a 46-yard field goal to give the Crimson Tide a 6–3 lead. On the next drive, LSU was able to gain a pair of first downs primarily with only runs by Jefferson and Ford, but again were forced to punt.
