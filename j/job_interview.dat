40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a sociolinguistic, data-driven {{study of}} authentic <b>job</b> <b>interviews</b> with second language speakers of Danish. The <b>job</b> <b>interviews</b> {{are part of}} a Danish governmental initiative aimed particularly at immigrants and newcomers to Denmark, who are assumed to experience linguistic and cultural difficulties at the Danish labour market. The particular designs of the <b>job</b> <b>interviews</b> as well as the explicitly stated evaluations of language and culture create an unusual frame. On the one hand we deal with "traditional" <b>job</b> <b>interviews</b> as institutional gatekeeping instruments; on the other hand we face a tailored selection process meant {{to address the needs of}} the vulnerable. These contradictory practices produce certain tensions: although the <b>job</b> <b>interviews</b> in focus are meant to accomplish the target group's special needs, they exemplify a practice in which the good intentions are all dressed up but have nowhere to go...|$|R

5|$|Chris (Rob Lowe) has fired Denis Cooper, {{the former}} health {{department}} public relations director, who hung posters around city hall to publicly condemn his adulterous wife.

Although reluctant to leave {{her job as a}} nurse, Ann agrees to attend the <b>job</b> <b>interview,</b> and Leslie provides her with an overwhelming amount of reading material to prepare for it. Meanwhile, Tom (Aziz Ansari) encourages the parks department to attend the Snakehole Lounge, a nightclub he partially owns with his friend Jean-Ralphio Saperstein (Ben Schwartz), for the unveiling of his new alcoholic beverage, Snake Juice. Tom also encourages them to spread the word about the drink through word of mouth guerilla marketing. April (Aubrey Plaza) shows little interest in attending, until Andy (Chris Pratt) suggests they make a game of it by role-playing as different people at the bar.

5|$|Of {{the many}} studies on behavior-based early {{intervention}} programs, most are case reports {{of up to}} five participants and typically examine a few problem behaviors such as self-injury, aggression, noncompliance, stereotypies, or spontaneous language; unintended side effects are largely ignored. Despite the popularity of social skills training, its effectiveness is not firmly established. A randomized controlled study of a model for training parents in problem behaviors in their children with AS showed that parents attending a one-day workshop or six individual lessons reported fewer behavioral problems, while parents receiving the individual lessons reported less intense behavioral problems in their AS children. Vocational training is important to teach <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> etiquette and workplace behavior to older children and adults with AS, and organization software and personal data assistants can improve the work and life management of people with AS.|$|E

He selfishly takes money from the family to buy a motorbike, but then sells it to help pay the mortgage. When Zainab says she will stop interfering in people's lives, AJ uses the opportunity to annoy her. AJ and Aliyah receive their decree nisi. When Zainab has a <b>job</b> <b>interview,</b> AJ tells the interviewer she has short-term memory loss. However, when he apologises via a Post-It note, she returns the apology. AJ supports Masood when his relationship with Zainab ends. When AJ has to look after Masood's young son Kamil Masood (Arian Chikhlia), {{he admits that he}} is not good with children, and was scared when Aliyah wanted one, because he feels he cannot look after himself properly, let alone a child. However, he bonds well with his nephew. AJ is offered a job as an assistant manager at a garage in Birmingham. Although he initially wants to turn down the position, he eventually accepts the job offer. Shortly before he leaves Walford, AJ learns that his mother has died.

5|$|Bianca tells Whitney she {{is moving}} to Milton Keynes with her partner Terry Spraggan (Terry Alderton), and wants her to move with them and the children. Although {{originally}} agreeing, Lee persuades her to stay and she moves into the pub with the Carters. Lee develops depression, and when Whitney finds out, she struggles to support him at his lowest points. At Mick's stag party before his wedding to Linda, Lee knocks himself unconscious and is carried upstairs by Mick and Whitney. Whitney confesses to Mick that she intends to break up with Lee after the wedding, unable to handle his depression. However, she is unaware that Lee has overheard her via the baby monitor. On {{the day of the}} wedding, Lee goes missing and Whitney and Mick find him drunk at the park. Lee tells Whitney that he blames himself for her wanting to break up with him, and she promises him that they will work things out. Whitney later thanks Mick for helping her with Lee, but accidentally kisses him on the lips in the process. While Mick and Linda are on their honeymoon, Whitney invites Ryan back to Walford to see Lily, but while at the pub, he steals the cash from the safe, causing Whitney and Nancy to fight, just as Mick and Linda walk in on them. The next morning, Whitney contacts Ryan and he asks to meet in the park. Mick accompanies Whitney and assures a scared Ryan that he can trust him. It then emerges that Whitney told Mick that Ryan killed Rob, so Whitney and Mick convince Ryan to return the money and hand himself to the police, and Whitney will back him up in the hope of him being charged with manslaughter instead of murder, to which Ryan agrees. Whitney shares an emotional goodbye with Ryan as he heads into the police station. On the ride home from the police station, an upset Whitney tells Mick that she has feelings for him and kisses him again. Mick tells Linda what happened, so Linda tells her to stay away from Mick and not to give up on Lee. Whitney later visits Ryan in prison, stating that she is worried about Lee. When she accidentally says Mick's name, he guesses that she has feelings for Mick, which she denies. He then urges Whitney to help Lee, so she gets him a <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> at a local pub, however this causes major grievances between Lee and Nancy. Whitney is forced by Babe to tell Lee about her kissing Mick, and although Nancy tells her to move out, Lee's response is to propose marriage.|$|E

Applicants were always women, whereas interviewers were either men or women. Interviewers' nonverbal dominance (visual dominance, speaking interruptions) and friendliness (smiling, nodding) were coded based on videotapes. Male interviewers' dominance (but not friendliness) predicted lower self-evaluations of female applicants and lower evaluations {{made by the}} interviewers. Female interviewers' nonverbal behavior did not predict outcomes. Implications {{for the advancement of}} women in the workplace are discussed, such as the importance of acknowledging and changing nonverbal dynamics to improve women's performance in <b>job</b> <b>interviews...</b>|$|R

25|$|Racial {{discrimination}} in hiring {{has been shown}} to exist in the United States and in Europe. By means of their path breaking field experiment, Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan, showed that applications from job candidates with white-sounding names got 50 percent more callbacks for interviews than those with African-American-sounding names in the United States at the start of this millennium. A 2009 study by Devah Pager, Bruce Western, and Bart Bonikowski found that black applicants to low-wage jobs were half as likely as identically qualified white applicants to receive callbacks or job offers. More recently, Stijn Baert, Bart Cockx, Niels Gheyle and Cora Vandamme replicated and extended their field experiment in Belgium, Europe. They found that racial {{discrimination in}} the labour market is heterogeneous by the labour market tightness in the occupation: compared to natives, candidates with a foreign-sounding name are equally often invited to a <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> in Belgium if they apply for occupations for which vacancies are difficult to fill, but they have to send twice as many applications for occupations for which labor market tightness is low.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Austria {{issued in}} 2010, later than other countries, a "National Action Plan for Integration" and is {{developing}} several measures for migrants' and their children' inclusion including the labor market. However, several ethnic groups undeniably face {{limited access to}} the labor market. The unequal job opportunities of immigrants and minorities can be analyzed from different perspectives. In this paper a practice theory perspective is preferred. Ethnicized recruiting practices, such as in <b>job</b> <b>interviews</b> or other recruiting practices, shape this process of social marginalization of minorities or even exclusion of some social groups. This paper focuses on that issue. Recruiting in <b>job</b> <b>interviews</b> is seen as specific discourse that represent and value persons and/or practices in a specific setting. <b>Job</b> <b>interviews</b> can include doings and sayings that classify persons as a less-worthy "other" or indirectly affect ethnic minorities. Practices can change towards inviting these people to express and communicate {{in a way that}} leads to a more inclusive recruitment. ...|$|R
