25|$|Strictly, if {{the barrier}} field in Fowler-Nordheim 1928 theory is exactly {{proportional}} to the applied voltage, and if the emission area is independent of voltage, then the Fowler-Nordheim 1928 theory predicts that plots of the form (log(i/V2) vs. 1/V) should be exact straight lines.

30|$|The {{comparative}} analysis of theoretical and <b>experimental</b> <b>results</b> reveals that <b>experimental</b> <b>results</b> {{are consistent with}} theoretical findings in terms of improvement over other protocols. The magnitude of energy efficiency improvement is however not same in theoretical and experimental evaluation. We argue that this minor inconsistency exists because theoretical results only quantify the expected value of energy improvement whereas during the <b>experimental</b> <b>results</b> we observed that traces collected under the same setup also largely exhibit varying behaviors. These variations are highlighted in the <b>experimental</b> <b>results.</b>|$|R

25|$|Modern {{nuclear physics}} and {{particle}} physics experiments often involve {{large numbers of}} data analysts working together to extract quantitative data from complex datasets. In particular, the analysts want to report accurate systematic error estimates for all of their measurements; this is difficult or impossible {{if one of the}} errors is observer bias. To remove this bias, the experimenters devise blind analysis techniques, where the <b>experimental</b> <b>result</b> is hidden from the analysts until they've agreed—based on properties of the data set other than the final value—that the analysis techniques are fixed.|$|E
25|$|Statistical {{significance}} test : A predecessor to the statistical hypothesis test (see the Origins section). An <b>experimental</b> <b>result</b> {{was said to}} be statistically significant if a sample was sufficiently inconsistent with the (null) hypothesis. This was variously considered common sense, a pragmatic heuristic for identifying meaningful experimental results, a convention establishing a threshold of statistical evidence or a method for drawing conclusions from data. The statistical hypothesis test added mathematical rigor and philosophical consistency to the concept by making the alternative hypothesis explicit. The term is loosely used to describe the modern version which is now part of statistical hypothesis testing.|$|E
25|$|Significance {{testing has}} been the favored {{statistical}} tool in some experimental social sciences (over 90% of articles in the Journal of Applied Psychology during the early 1990s). Other fields have favored the estimation of parameters (e.g., effect size). Significance testing {{is used as a}} substitute for the traditional comparison of predicted value and <b>experimental</b> <b>result</b> {{at the core of the}} scientific method. When theory is only capable of predicting the sign of a relationship, a directional (one-sided) hypothesis test can be configured so that only a statistically significant result supports theory. This form of theory appraisal is the most heavily criticized application of hypothesis testing.|$|E

25|$|The {{first law}} of {{thermodynamics}} is so general that its predictions cannot all be directly tested. In many properly conducted experiments {{it has been}} precisely supported, and never violated. Indeed, within its scope of applicability, the law is so reliably established, that, nowadays, rather than experiment being considered as testing the accuracy of the law, it is more practical and realistic to think of the law as testing the accuracy of experiment. An <b>experimental</b> <b>result</b> that seems to violate the law may be assumed to be inaccurate or wrongly conceived, for example due to failure to account for an important physical factor. Thus, some may regard it as a principle more abstract than a law.|$|E
500|$|A 2017 {{experiment}} at the JINR, producing 284Nh and 285Nh via the 243Am+48Ca reaction as {{the daughters}} of 288Mc and 289Mc, avoided this problem by removing the quartz surface, using only Teflon. No nihonium atoms were observed after chemical separation, implying an unexpectedly large retention of nihonium atoms on Teflon surfaces. This <b>experimental</b> <b>result</b> for the interaction limit of nihonium atoms with a Teflon surface [...] disagrees significantly with previous theory, which expected a far lower value of 14.00kJ/mol. This also implies that the nihonium species involved in the previous experiment was likely not elemental nihonium but rather nihonium hydroxide, and that high-temperature techniques such as vacuum chromatography {{would be necessary to}} further probe the behavior of elemental nihonium.|$|E
2500|$|Referring to the {{critique}} of Poincaré from 1900, Lorentz wrote in his famous paper in 1904, where he extended his theorem of corresponding states: [...] "Surely, the course of inventing special hypotheses for each new <b>experimental</b> <b>result</b> is somewhat artificial. It would be more satisfactory, {{if it were possible}} to show, by means of certain fundamental assumptions, and without neglecting terms of one order of magnitude or another, that many electromagnetic actions are entirely independent of the motion of the system." ...|$|E
