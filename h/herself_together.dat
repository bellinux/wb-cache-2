25|$|According to Anna Komnene (The Alexiad, XII.6–7), Michael Anemas was {{the first}} man to be imprisoned there, and after him the tower and prison were {{subsequently}} named. Michael had conspired against Anna's father, Emperor Alexios I, but the plot was uncovered and he and his fellow conspirators were captured and sentenced to imprisonment and blinding, the usual punishment meted out to traitors. His pleas for mercy, however, as he was being led through the Mese, aroused the sympathy of the people and of Anna <b>herself.</b> <b>Together</b> with her mother, she interceded on his behalf with Alexios. Anemas was indeed shown clemency: he was not blinded, but confined for several years to the tower that was to bear his name. The next prisoner arrived at the tower even before Anemas was finally pardoned and released. It was Gregory Taronites, the doux of Chaldia, the region around Trebizond. Taking advantage of his province's relative isolation, he had tried to make himself an independent ruler in 1104. Even after his capture, however, according to the Alexiad, he remained defiant, leading to a long period of incarceration before he was finally released and pardoned.|$|E
25|$|Coincidentally, {{she meets}} Kazuto's avatar, Kirito, in Alfheim Online after he saves her from {{an attack by}} player killers. Unaware of his true identity, she decides to help him on his quest to find {{somebody}} which eventually leads them to the world tree. After understanding the depth of Kazuto's love for Asuna, she resolves {{to give up on}} him and instead becomes attached to Kirito in ALO. However, when Kirito's true identity is revealed, she is heartbroken {{and the two of them}} have an awkward exchange in the real world where Sugu reveals her feelings for him. Not knowing how to respond or comfort her, Kazuto tells her he will be waiting for her in game. When they meet up they engage in a fight which culminates with both of them letting down their guard expecting the other one to kill them, however that only leads to them hugging and apologizing to each other. Leafa lets go of her feelings for Kirito and after pulling <b>herself</b> <b>together</b> she helps him rescue Asuna from the top of the world tree. She regularly plays ALO together with Kirito, Asuna, Silica, Klein and the rest of their group. Leafa, Lisbeth and Silica also feature as protagonists in the spin-off manga series Sword Art Online: Girls' Ops, where they form a team with Kirito away on a study program and Asuna tied up in family affairs.|$|E
500|$|Winehouse was {{released}} from the London Clinic 24 hours after returning from a temporary leave to perform at Nelson Mandela's 90th birthday and at a concert in Glastonbury, and continued receiving treatment as an outpatient. In July 2008, Winehouse stated that she had been diagnosed with [...] "some areas of emphysema" [...] and said she was getting <b>herself</b> <b>together</b> by [...] "eating loads of healthy food, sleeping loads, playing my guitar, making music and writing letters to my husband every day."

Winehouse began precautionary testing on her lungs and chest on 25 October 2008 at the London Clinic for what was reported as a chest infection.

500|$|Kyla's [...] "no-nonsense" [...] {{personality}} {{has led to}} {{mixed reviews}} in the press. A number of episodes central to her storylines have been reviewed by various publications as televisual 'picks of the day' - from her introductory episode, {{to the death of}} her husband, to the surprise return of her former boyfriend Abra. Her [...] "fiery" [...] stance resulted in the assessment that, from a viewing perspective, the character [...] "has never been one of the more likeable members of staff", however her descent into alcoholism drew some more sympathetic reviews, with Linda Gibson of TV Quick writing of the character: [...] "Let's hope that Kyla pulls <b>herself</b> <b>together,</b> gets her son back and meets a man who can give her what she wants." [...] Conversely, Daily Mirror TV critic Jim Shelley opined that the character had formerly been one of the more [...] "normal" [...] and [...] "reliable" [...] members of the cast, but criticized the handling of her alcoholism storyline, stating that the character seemed to have become an alcoholic [...] "overnight".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{released}} on November 22, 1994 on MTV. It was also part of VH1's relaunching promotional campaigns, where the channel used the video in its trio of 30 second commercials titled [...] "The New VH1". The commercial showed a couple in a vintage porsche pulling {{in front of an}} ATM cash machine. The man makes a transaction while the woman looks at VH1 playing at a store, showing [...] "Take a Bow". When the man turns back to the car, the woman is gone and can be seen inside the video alongside Madonna, while the singer appears in the car, and utters the tagline: [...] "The new VH1... It'll suck you in". According to Abbey Konowitch, who worked on Madonna's Maverick Records, the singer had a long history with MTV and VH1, and hence was eager to participate in the campaign when asked by VH1 president John Sykes. For filming the commercial, the cloths worn in the video had to be flown in from the different designers. Madonna was also impressed by the technology used in the commercial for transposing the woman and <b>herself</b> <b>together.</b>|$|E
500|$|Quinn's {{increasingly}} odd {{behavior was}} commented on by several reviewers. Chaney wrote {{that she was}} acting [...] "in an irrational manner that has no connection with reality", and Bell wondered if co-creator Murphy was [...] "trying to make her the most hated character on 'Glee' ever". Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times, though she noted that [...] "Quinn's character just gets weirder and weirder", wrote that Puck gets it right: [...] "Quinn's the craziest, most self-involved character on the show", but [...] "has a resilience that may take her far in life" [...] and needs a [...] "healthy dose of self-esteem". VanDerWerff was initially pleased that the show [...] "acknowledged that all of her actions are driven by a deep, sucking need to be loved" [...] and that [...] "Puck gently {{told her that she}} was better than that, that she could put <b>herself</b> <b>together</b> again", but not that it then [...] "just turned into more pointless Puck/Shelby/Quinn drama. Ugh." [...] Critics such as Kubicek were even more scathing about Shelby and the storyline with Puck that led to the pair having sex during the episode: [...] "The dumbest storyline Glee has ever done gets even dumber." [...] Sullivan called it [...] "the most divisive plot line of the season", and Bell asked, [...] "Instead of these super creepy scenes between Puck and Shelby, can we please get more screen time for Shelby and Rachel?" ...|$|E

500|$|On Riven Atrus meets Catherine, a local {{inhabitant}} and {{a brilliant}} student of Gehn's who shows promise in the Art of writing Ages, despite not being D'ni <b>herself.</b> <b>Together</b> they trap Gehn on Riven. Atrus' grandmother, Anna ("Ti'ana"), helps Catherine by writing the Age of Myst as an escape route while Atrus destroys every other linking book on Riven. [...] The linking book to Myst is {{dropped into a}} starry expanse known as the Star Fissure, where it is presumed lost (but later found by the Stranger, beginning the events of Myst). Catherine and Atrus start a family on Myst, raising their two sons, Sirrus and Achenar; however, both boys grow greedy and seek to strand their parents, trapping Atrus on K'veer (an island in the cavern near the main D'ni city) and luring Catherine to Riven, where she is captured by Gehn. The Stranger's discovery of the Myst linking book saves Atrus from being trapped in K'veer a second time, and Catherine from Gehn's clutches. Moving to Tomahna, Atrus and Catherine have a third child, their daughter Yeesha, and attempt to resurrect the D'ni by writing a new Age for the people called Releeshahn. By the events of , Catherine has died (likely from old age), and an elderly Atrus confines himself in Releeshahn to live {{out the rest of}} his life. Atrus is played by Rand Miller in all the Myst installments. Catherine is portrayed by Sheila Goold in Riven, with her voice dubbed by Rengin Altay, and Maria Galante in Exile.|$|E
500|$|For Kilgrave, Maslansky used many suits {{created by}} {{designer}} Paul Smith, rather than custom-making {{them as she}} originally planned, as Smith [...] "was [...] about purple" [...] in the previous fashion season. On the suits, Maslansky added that the designers [...] "wanted {{to find a place}} where we could utilize clothing in shades of purple, but not go so over the top that it would look silly and that he would stop feeling ominous or menacing." [...] Expanding on this, Maslansky called purple a traditionally [...] "fairly friendly color, and he’s anything but friendly. So I had to find ways to make him be ominous and frightening and terrifying. I found that I needed the right proportion of shades of purple to other shades that were similar: navy, black, maroon." [...] Maslansky felt Luke Cage was also someone [...] "who wears his clothing like an armor," [...] with his wardrobe consisting of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket. For a character like Trish Walker, who does not {{have the same kind of}} [...] "statement costume" [...] as Jones, Maslansky tried to create a certain character style. Maslansky said that Walker's uniform is fashion, so [...] "even when she was hanging around the house, she was wearing a pair of rag & bone jeans with a Chloé top, and this was her version of a T-shirt and jeans." [...] Maslansky added that Robin was [...] "a blast to dress" [...] because of her [...] "quirky" [...] personality, yet she was still able to [...] "put <b>herself</b> <b>together</b> aesthetically." [...] For Malcolm, as his story progressively became brighter throughout the season, so did his wardrobe, becoming [...] "a little brighter and a little more hopeful." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Laging Ikaw" [...] , {{the only}} {{original}} Tagalog {{song in the}} album, was written by Jose Villanueva III. The song is a midtempo pop blues containing elements of R, and has a bassline that is aligned with its electronic keyboard notes. It is described as [...] "pop-ish." [...] "Only with You" [...] and [...] "I Came to Dance" [...] were written by Amber Davis and produced by DJ High Rez. Both songs feature [...] "infectious and enticing party-house music." [...] "I Don't Want to Fight" [...] is an acoustic ballad, written by her close friend and ASAP Sessionistas group mate, Richard Poon, exclusively for her. [...] "Starlight" [...] is a progressive ballad, originally recorded by Nora Aunor. [...] "Missing You" [...] was written by Arnie Mendaros, whom Nina has worked with in her debut album.

2500|$|Faith {{was brought}} {{back for the}} final season of Buffy, because, {{according}} to David Solomon, [...] "she {{had been such a}} crucial character at a very specific junction in the series {{that there would be no}} way to tie it up without her." [...] However, in season seven the dynamic between the two Slayers has changed. As Rebecca Rand Kirshner explains, [...] " [...] is no longer such a complete opposite of Buffy. And there's sort of a subtler and more complicated dynamic between them". As Buffy struggles with her unwanted position of mentor to the Potential Slayers, the writers used Faith to create an outside conflict about Buffy's leadership abilities. Although Faith is questioning Buffy and her choices she is making, she is no longer an enemy to her either. In the episode [...] "Empty Places", the Potentials lose trust in Buffy and appoint Faith as their leader instead, a decision that literally blows up in their faces. As Drew Goddard explains, [...] "Faith is like the cool aunt that everyone loves, because the cool aunt doesn't have the responsibility of raising the children. She just gets to show up and have fun. The problem is, Faith is not ready to lead. She's damaged in her own way. She's just beginning to pull <b>herself</b> <b>together.</b> As much as she wants to be Buffy, she has to learn how to become Faith." ...|$|E

On 1 December, Léonie, covered in eczema and hiding her hair under a short mantilla, had returned to Les Buissonnets after just seven weeks of the Poor Clares regime in Alençon", and her sisters were helping her get over her sense of failure and humiliation. Back at Les Buissonnets as every year, Thérèse [...] "as was the custom for French children, had left her shoes on the hearth, empty in anticipation of gifts, not from Father Christmas but from the Child Jesus, who was imagined to travel through the air bearing toys and cakes." [...] While she and Celine were going up the stairs she heard her father, [...] "perhaps exhausted by the hour, or this reminder of the relentless emotional demands of his weepy youngest daughter", say with some irritation [...] "Therese is far too old for this now. Fortunately this will be the last year!" [...] Thérèse had begun to cry and Céline advised her not to go back downstairs immediately. Then, suddenly, Thérèse pulled <b>herself</b> <b>together</b> and wiped her tears. She ran down the stairs, knelt by the fireplace and unwrapped her surprises as jubilantly as ever. In her account, nine years later, of 1895 : [...] "In an instant Jesus, content with my good will, accomplished the work I {{had not been able to}} do in ten years." [...] After nine sad years she had [...] "recovered the strength of soul she had lost" [...] when her mother died and, she said, [...] "she was to retain it forever". She discovered the joy in self-forgetfulness and added, [...] "I felt, in a word, charity enter my heart, the need to forget myself to make others happy—Since this blessed night I was not defeated in any battle, but instead I went from victory to victory and began, so to speak, [...] "to run a giant's course" [...] (Psalms [...] ).|$|E
