40|$|Is there a {{relationship}} between economic fluctuations and transportation demand? How does a GDP variation influence passenger and freight mobility? Interested readers may find an answer to both these questions in the following paper. Taking Italian regions as subject of the analysis, the paper describes a simplified but rather reliable elasticity-based procedure {{for the analysis of}} transportation demand. Within this paper, elasticity can be roughly defined as the percentage change in the transportation demand produced from a unit fluctuation of GDP. The concept of elasticity will be widely defined in section 1, also summarising some of the most interesting results of the literature. As the use of elasticity for the forecast of transportation demand is also considered in this paper, section 2 deals with a brief overview of the main methods. In section 3, relations between transportation demand and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for Italy are derived, a forecast method based on transportation elasticity is developed and its results considered {{in the light of the}} literature. Section 4 gives statistic evidence to the method and analyses of demand elasticity of the Italian regional systems. Finally, some conclusions are <b>drawn</b> (<b>section</b> 5) ...|$|E
40|$|Engineering {{design is}} a kind of human {{activity}} that makes use of many different knowledge sources. Basically, this may be a well structured, explicit, and domain specific knowledge or tacit, implicit, and experience-based knowledge. Each type of knowledge has its particular role in design, and thus in knowledge-based design support systems. In this report several issues concerning knowledge-based design support systems are reviewed and discussed. The document begins with a brief introduction of a design process and highlights some of its features. The introduction is followed by a brief review of the nature of design. Two important features of design that are relevant from the knowledge-centred point of view are discussed more deeply – creativity and a need for reflection. Later, the implications toward design support are <b>drawn.</b> <b>Section</b> III discusses the knowledge-based support for the design; first it reviews the related research, then introduces knowledge modelling as a technology, and finally gives an overview of knowledge-based design support as a problem of knowledge (re-) use. Further parts of the document present a new approach to the knowledge-based design support based on the common ontologies and analogous reasoning. Section IV gives a brief overview of the proposed approach, followed by Section V presenting preliminary design guidelines and Section VI presenting a scenario of their application.

40|$|We give {{conditions}} on a monoidal model category M {{and on a}} set of maps C so that the Bousfield localization of M with respect to C preserves the structure of algebras over various operads. This problem was motivated by an example that demonstrates that, for the model category of equivariant spectra, preservation does not come for free, even for cofibrant operads. We discuss this example in detail and provide a general theorem regarding when localization preserves P-algebra structure for an arbitrary operad P. We characterize the localizations that respect monoidal structure and prove that all such localizations preserve algebras over cofibrant operads. As a special case we recover numerous classical theorems about preservation of algebraic structure under localization, in the context of spaces, spectra, chain complexes, and equivariant spectra. We also provide several new results in these settings, and we sharpen a recent result of Hill and Hopkins regarding preservation for equivariant spectra. To demonstrate our preservation result for non-cofibrant operads, we work out when localization preserves commutative monoids and the commutative monoid axiom, and again numerous examples are provided. Finally, we provide conditions so that localization preserves the monoid axiom. Comment: Version 2 contains major revisions to Section 5, and minor revisions to sections 6, 7, 8, and the introduction. Edited in response to comments from a referee. The situation of localizations for equivariant spectra is now presented in a clearer fashion, and connections to other recent papers (including connections to N-infinity operads) are now <b>drawn.</b> <b>Section</b> 6 results are now "if and only if. ...|$|E
40|$|Section A {{reviews the}} {{literature}} which has investigated variables found {{to relate to}} recovery style in individuals with psychosis. Studies exploring the attachment, self-esteem, depression and executive functioning are evaluated and conclusions <b>drawn.</b> <b>Section</b> B reports the findings of an empirical study investigating the relationship between metacognition, recovery style, anxiety and depression in a community sample of individuals with psychosis. Objective; Research has shown that individuals with psychosis will either integrate their experience of psychosis or seal the experience over. Little is known about what leads to these different styles of recovery but poor attachment, depression, low self-esteem and poor executive functioning {{have been linked to}} a sealing-over style. This study hypothesised that sealing is linked to unhealthy metacognitive beliefs and also to higher levels of anxiety and depression. Method; Forty-three participants with a diagnosis of psychosis were recruited. They completed the Metacognitions Questionnaire- 30, Recovery Style Questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results; Correlational analysis revealed that only one facet of metacognition linked to sealing over; this being positive beliefs about worry and this was maintained when the effects of anxiety and depression were accounted for. Contrary to the hypothesis, recovery style did not correlate with anxiety or depression but unhealthy metacognition was linked to both anxiety and depression. Conclusions; The findings {{of this study suggest that}} a sealing-over recovery style may be linked to one specific area of metacognitive dysfunction. They also cast doubt on previous theories which link low mood to a sealing-over style. Limitations of this study include its cross-sectional design. Future research which expands on these findings is encouraged and longitudinal research is particularly called for. Section C provides a critical evaluation of the project, answering four questions regarding what the author has learnt from the study, what might have been done differently, how the study might affect the author‟s clinical work in future and possible future research directions.

40|$|Universities are {{increasingly}} seen as engines for regional innovation and economic growth. Some famous high-tech regions have developed {{on the basis}} of universities, for example Silicon Valley in California, Greater Boston in Massachusetts, or the Research Triangle in North Carolina. In these regions, university spin-offs are regarded as one important vehicle of knowledge transfer and commercialization from university to industry. In this paper {{the focus is on the}} persons who are behind these processes. Academic entrepreneurs develop great ideas at university and decide to put them into practice. One famous example is the Stanford University PhD Student Larry Page, who founded the internet search engine Google. Academic entrepreneurs are persons of different university career levels, from students over research staff to professors. The aim of this paper is to investigate how the academic entrepreneurs? university career level can affect university spin-off growth in terms of job creation. Therefore, research questions are derived from three theoretical perspectives: human capital, university status and role identity. My empirical analysis is based on qualitative survey data from two German midrange universities. I carried out a total of 85 semi structured face-to-face and telephone interviews with academic entrepreneurs during the period September 2011 to January 2012. The analytical process relied on a qualitative content analysis and extreme case analysis. I show that, in order to distinguish high growth from low growth university spin-offs, it is important to understand the interactions of the academic entrepreneur?s human capital, university status and role identity. By investigating the academic entrepreneurs? career paths in-depth, it becomes clear that every university career level comprises certain advantages to benefit from and disadvantages to cope with. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the factors which influence university spin-off growth and can help to improve university spin-off support. This paper is structured as followed: First of all the three theoretical perspectives are discussed and three research questions are derived (section 2). After introducing the data and methods used in this paper and pointing out limitations (section 3), empirical results of the qualitative content analysis (section 4) and extreme case analysis (section 5) are discussed.

40|$|I take {{humans to}} {{basically}} strive toward {{a condition of}} peace enabling human flourishing. Yet human groups and individuals alike have an extraordinary wide range of understandings of such a condition. If hope for lasting peace and joint cooperation is to emerge from rule of law or otherwise underpin global harmony, first these very concepts need to be unpacked in proper detail. Given the remarkable diversity of legal practices across societies, simply looking at our own will prove insufficient. I suggest building on both Eastern and Western traditions of thought, as well as looking at contemporary practices across the globe {{in an attempt to}} enquire into the nature and historical background of the two key notions: rule of law (section 1) and harmony (section 2). Some concluding remarks are then <b>drawn</b> (<b>section</b> 3). First, we focus on “rule of law” (ROL) : Is it a likely candidate to set the foundations of global harmony? Looking at the meaning that “rule of law” has acquired within a broad range of fields (legal theory, law and jurisprudence, political philosophy, political science, international relations, sociology and social theory), the first striking aspect {{is that it does not}} seem to be the monopoly of technical definitions (principles of legality and impartiality). Historically, the appeal of ROL derived from the distinction between “empire of laws” (rule by law) and “empire of men” (rule under men). Today, both practitioners and scholars refer to ROL as an aggregate of legal rules and institutions, but also as a variety of informal discursive practices aimed at legitimising those rules and institutions. One-size-fits-all definitions can obviously be found, but they suffer from tremendously high levels of generality. Once we acknowledge the need for distinctions, however, we find too many. The long-standing distinction between thin (or procedural) and thick (or substantive) conceptions of ROL has been debated at great length, as has the difference between rule of law, rule by law etc. At this point there is little to be gained by further restatements of these basic distinctions. However, abandoning this debate will not reduce the number of competing conceptions: Rechtsstaat, État de droit, Estado de derecho. Moreover, the continental civil law tradition also developed other concepts that are smeared into the Anglo-Saxon formula, including certezza del diritto, sécurité juridique, etc. We should also ask whether Chinese fazhi is or might be a Far Eastern equivalent to rule of law. A promising start is then to go beyond the consensus omnia of international declarations and shed light on the arguments of those who do not estimate that rule of law enhances concord. ROL appears to be equivocal and often (covertly) value-laden both in ordinary language and scholarly literature. Three criticisms of rule of law are taken into consideration. One criticism holds it to be a case of law-fare: Not a mere technical device, ROL is rather an instrument for hegemony. Another criticism holds ROL to be a Western invention (legal Occidentalism) : What is being questioned is not a specific set of institutions that may, rightly or wrongly, be identified as “Western (rule of) law. ” The challenge goes deeper and concerns the epistemological status of law itself. A third criticism comes from “global constitutionalism. ” The ideal of ROL is not questioned as much as the way it is currently practiced: Since it lacks effectiveness, it is unsatisfactory. Given that constitutionalism, at state level, implied that constitutions made legislative power respect the constitution, advocates of international constitutionalism calls for such a paradigmatic change in the international arena. These arguments show that ROL is no “magic bullet” : Its banner was used as a synonym for an independent judiciary, but came to include democracy, rights, civil society and many more. This conceptual overstretch explains why rule of law is not likely to promote global concord. In section two, it seems prima facie that “harmony” has much higher odds for being a stepping stone for lasting peace: The concept has figured prominently in both Eastern and Western philosophical traditions where it indicates concord, equilibrium between forces resulting in peace, in opposition to disorder (chaos in the Greek tradition and luan in the Chinese tradition). The order emerging from harmony is a composition of differences and not merely a sum of unities. On a social level, harmony is a relational concept and hints to concert or absence of contradiction in relationships between individuals and/or groups. Contrarily to rule of law, we do not deal with an essentially contested concept: its structure is not seriously questioned. Moreover, contrarily to ROL, we have a clear referent: The CCP’s commitment to “building a harmonious society” was officially announced in 2002 and has since been added to the basic line in its constitution. Here, the arguments of those who disbelieve the emancipating strength of harmony have to be addressed. First, there is the legal positivist’s objection: Harmony amounts to natural law-talk that suffers, ultimately, from abusing Hume’s principle. Secondly, there is the criticism of the liberal democrat: Let aside the epistemological and theoretical nature of the concept, in the realm of practical reason harmony implies an essential (and fix) hierarchy of people that will inevitably lead to autocratic political regimes. The overall idea is that the harmonious order does not take controversy seriously: contradictions have to be eradicated or hidden in order to promote (apparent) stability. Harmony would then only amount to a cover-up status quo, based on manufactured consensus. In conclusion, I suggest that there are two lessons to be learnt if we want to overcome the cultural divides of the West-östlicher Diwan: From the rule of law, we must hence learn again the fundamental lesson of impartiality as an indispensable element in applying the principle of justice. From harmony, we must refine our understanding of the complex ways in which social cohesion is enhanced and without which no order is sustainable...|$|E
