25|$|Companies {{that operate}} strong CSR {{activities}} tend to drive customer's attention to buy {{products or services}} regardless of the price. As a result, this increases competition among firms since customers {{are aware of the}} company's CSR practices. These initiatives serve as a potential differentiator because they not only add value to the company, but also to the products or services. Furthermore, firms under intense competition are able to leverage CSR to increase the impact of their distribution on the firm's performance. For instance, lowering the carbon footprint of a firm's distribution network or engaging in fair trade are potential <b>differentiators</b> to lower costs and increase profits. In this scenario, customers can observe the company's commitment to CSR while increasing company sales.|$|E
