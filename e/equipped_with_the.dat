5|$|The AW101 is <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Blue Kestrel {{search and}} {{detection}} radar which {{is capable of}} 360 degree scanning and can detect small targets as far as 25 nautical miles. As part of the Royal Navy's Merlin HM2 upgrade program, Lockheed Martin implemented a series of improvements to the radar, notably allowing it to track 40 {{times the number of}} targets previously capable. Danish EH101s are fitted with the RDR-1600 search and weather radar. Royal Navy Merlins are <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> AQS901 anti-submarine system for processing sonographic data from sonobuoys to detect and target submerged submarines.

For this tour of duty, in addition to the Navy Cross, Ramage was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross twice and the Air Medal six times. In September 1944, Ramage received his last wartime assignment, as commanding officer of Bombing Squadron Ninety Eight VB-98, a California-based training unit. He remained with VB-98 until July 1946.|$|E

Some of the smaller bases would be built north of the MAR to provide protection to this central station.|$|E

A total of 680 M15s were produced in 1943 by White and Autocar before the considerable stress this mount {{placed on the}} M3 chassis, which resulted in its replacement with the M54 mount. The new mount reversed weapon placement, used simpler and lighter air-cooled M2 Brownings, and added a M6 sighting system.|$|E
