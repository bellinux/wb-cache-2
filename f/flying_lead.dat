500|$|Magness-Blake {{said one}} of the most {{dangerous}} parts of Thunder's job is at the beginning of the game when he leads the team onto the field, as there are cheerleaders ahead of him waving their pom-poms and a team of excited football players behind him. Ann Judge has also remarked about the team getting [...] "amped up" [...] with energy and excitement as Thunder leads them onto the field, explaining that [...] "To him, amped up means danger." [...] On one occasion, a person walked out unexpectedly in front of Thunder as he was leading the players onto the field. [...] Thunder stopped immediately, averting a potentially dangerous situation. Another unexpected event occurred in 2014 during Super Bowl XLVIII when the pyrotechnics display was supposed to have been executed before Thunder led the team out but it went off unexpectedly during his run. [...] Thunder responded to the situation with aplomb, continuing to run forward onto the field, though he performed <b>flying</b> <b>lead</b> changes with each explosion.|$|E

"A tornado, senores, a real {{hurricane}} of stampeded men, wild horses, mounted Indians, {{swept over}} me as I cowered {{on the ground}} {{by the side of}} Gaspar Ruiz, still stretched out on his face {{in the shape of a}} cross. Peneleo, galloping for life, jabbed at me with his long chuso in passing--for the sake of old acquaintance, I suppose. How I escaped the <b>flying</b> <b>lead</b> is more difficult to explain. Venturing to rise on my knees too soon some soldiers of the 17th Taltal regiment, in their hurry to get at something alive, nearly bayoneted me on the spot. They looked very disappointed, too, when, some officers galloping up drove them away with the flat of their swords.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} tubes, {{like the}} Deforest Spherical Audion from c. 1911, used the typical light bulb Edison socket for the heater, and <b>flying</b> <b>leads</b> {{for the other}} elements. Other tubes directly used <b>flying</b> <b>leads</b> for all of their contacts, like the Cunningham AudioTron from 1915, or the Deforest Oscillion. Type C6A xenon thyratrons, used in servos for the U.S. Navy Stable Element Mark 6, had a mogul screw base and L-shaped stiff wires at the top for grid and anode connections. Mating connectors were machined pairs of brass blocks with clamping screws, attached to <b>flying</b> <b>leads</b> (free hanging).|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the high}} {{frequencies}} often involved, oscilloscopes do not normally use simple wires ("flying leads") to connect to the DUT. Flying leads are likely to pick up interference, so they are not suitable for low-level signals. Furthermore, the inductance of <b>flying</b> <b>leads</b> make them unsuitable for high frequency signals. Instead, a specific scope probe is used, which uses a coaxial cable to transmit the signal {{from the tip of}} the probe to the oscilloscope. This cable has two main benefits: it protects the signal from external electromagnetic interference, improving accuracy for low-level signals; and it has a lower inductance than <b>flying</b> <b>leads,</b> making the probe more accurate for high-frequency signals.|$|R
5000|$|Physical convenience. Grid top caps on {{frequency}} converters could be connected directly to an adjacent coil; Anode top caps on output tubes could be connected by <b>flying</b> <b>leads</b> directly to an output transformer. Shorter leads generally mean greater stability.|$|R
60|$|They {{worked out}} a method. When the bird was {{alongside}} the several men with revolvers turned loose on me, while one man, overhauling and keeping the line taut, leaped to the rail and quickly hove the bird up and over and inboard. I know this long-distance revolver fire seriously bothered me. One cannot help jumping when death, {{in the form of}} a piece of <b>flying</b> <b>lead,</b> hits the rail beside him, or the mast over his head, or whines away in a ricochet from the steel shrouds. Nevertheless, I managed with my rifle to bother the exposed men on the rail to the extent that they lost one hooked bird out of two. And twenty-six men require a quantity of albatrosses and mollyhawks every twenty-four hours, while they can fish only in the daylight.|$|E

50|$|In reining {{and working}} cow horse <b>flying</b> <b>lead</b> changes are an {{integral}} part of nearly all patterns except for those at the most novice levels. They performed as part of a pattern, usually in a figure eight, and illustrate a high degree of training and responsiveness. A good <b>flying</b> <b>lead</b> change appears effortless both in the horse's actions and in the rider's cues. The horse will not speed up or slow down or display resentment (i.e. by switching its tail excessively) or hesitation. Controlled speed is desired in reining competition, and the faster a horse moves while properly executing the flying change, the higher the score.|$|E
50|$|Although {{coaxial cable}} has lower {{inductance}} than <b>flying</b> <b>leads,</b> it has higher capacitance: a typical 50 ohm cable has about 90 pF per meter. Consequently, a one-meter high-impedance direct (1×) coaxial probe may load the circuit with a capacitance of about 110 pF and a resistance of 1 megohm.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the back}} of the {{computer}} case, some major changes were made to the AT standard. Originally AT style cases had only a keyboard connector and expansion slots for add-on card backplates. Any other onboard interfaces (such as serial and parallel ports) had to be connected via <b>flying</b> <b>leads</b> to connectors which were mounted either on spaces provided by the case or brackets placed in unused expansion slot positions.|$|R
25|$|Open wire test <b>leads</b> (<b>flying</b> <b>leads)</b> {{are likely}} to pick up interference, so they are not {{suitable}} for low level signals. Furthermore, the leads have a high inductance, so they are not suitable for high frequencies. Using a shielded cable (i.e.,coaxial cable) is better for low level signals. Coaxial cable also has lower inductance, but it has higher capacitance: a typical 50ohm cable has about 90pF per meter. Consequently, a one-meter direct (1X) coaxial probe will load a circuit with a capacitance of about 110pF and a resistance of 1megohm.|$|R
50|$|The counter-canter is {{primarily}} {{used as a}} training movement, improving balance, straightness, and attention to the aids. It {{is used as a}} stepping-stone to the <b>flying</b> <b>lead</b> change. It is also a movement asked for in upper level dressage tests.|$|E
50|$|Most {{of these}} events are {{designed}} to display precise, controlled actions and tight teamwork between horse and rider at speed, and demonstrate many skills such as <b>flying</b> <b>lead</b> changes, sliding stops and more. Most clubs {{offer a variety of}} classes for all ages and abilities of people, allowing riders to compete at the speed level at which they are most capable and comfortable.|$|E
50|$|Western {{dressage}} {{consists of}} a basic test performed by horse and rider. At lower levels, competitors must perform a walk, trot or jog, and canter or lope. Higher level tests include lateral work and <b>flying</b> <b>lead</b> changes. Competitors are scored on how well they perform each movement within the test, {{by means of a}} score from 0 (not performed) to 10 (excellent).|$|E

25|$|For {{reasons of}} space, many devices, {{especially}} in DIN rail format, use <b>flying</b> <b>leads</b> rather than screw terminals, {{especially for the}} neutral input and FE connections. Additionally, {{because of the small}} form factor, the output cables of some models (Eaton/MEM) are used to form the primary winding of the RCD part, and the outgoing circuit cables must be led through a specially dimensioned terminal tunnel with the current transformer part around it. This can lead to incorrect failed trip results when testing with meter probes from the screw heads of the terminals, rather than from the final circuit wiring.|$|R

50|$|The BBC Model B is {{hardwired}} to deny {{writing to}} the Sideways area, so a write signal needs to be collected from somewhere. The methods vary, but the two most common methods are: removing chips from the board and placing them into an expansion board that occupies the chips' original sockets, and: fitting a RAM module in a ROM socket with a <b>flying</b> <b>lead</b> connected to a write signal elsewhere on the motherboard.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flying</b> <b>lead</b> change: {{the horse}} changes its leading front and hind legs at the lope mid-stride, during the {{suspension}} {{phase of the}} gait. The horse should not break gait nor change speed. While completing a change at speed can improve one's score, precision {{is the most important}} factor in judging: A horse taking more than one stride to complete the change, or a horse that changes early, late, or that changes only the front feet and not the hind feet will be penalized.|$|E
5000|$|... "Slow" [...] {{was changed}} to [...] "Collected" [...] on the test sheet. Collected walk, trot, and canter were required, as was {{extended}} trot posting followed by collected trot sitting. A 5-loop serpentine was introduced, to be ridden at the canter, both with <b>flying</b> <b>lead</b> changes and with counter-canter loops. The counter change of hand with flying changes was also introduced, as was 4-, 3-, 2-, and 1-tempi changes. The halt was performed through the walk, and followed by a salute.|$|E

50|$|In over fences classes (classes {{in which}} the horse and rider jump obstacles), the {{competitor}} rides over a course of at least six jumps (usually more). Equitation over fence classes rarely have fences higher than 3 ft. Classes for more accomplished riders may require at least one <b>flying</b> <b>lead</b> change, and one or more combinations. The rider is judged not only on position and effectiveness of riding aids, but should also maintain an even, forward pace and meet each fence at an appropriate distance.|$|E
50|$|Reining may be {{performed}} by any horse, but the Stock horse breeds, particularly the American Quarter Horse, dominate the field. The reining horse must be agile, quick, and very responsive to the rider's commands. Powerful hindquarters are required to hold position in a sliding stop or a rollback, excellent coordination is required for proper spins and <b>flying</b> <b>lead</b> changes. Correct leg conformation is essential, as the limbs and joints are often under considerable stress in competition. The horse must also have an excellent temperament to perform with both speed and precision.|$|E
50|$|The {{test light}} is an {{electric}} lamp connected {{with one or}} two insulated wire leads. Often, it {{takes the form of a}} screwdriver with the lamp connected between the tip of the screwdriver and a single lead that projects out the back of the screwdriver. By connecting the <b>flying</b> <b>lead</b> to an earth (ground) reference and touching the screwdriver tip to various points in the circuit, the presence or absence of voltage at each point can be determined, allowing simple faults to be detected and traced to their root cause. For higher voltages, a statiscope consisting of a neon glow tube mounted on a long insulating handle can be used to detect AC voltages of 2000 volts or more.|$|E

5000|$|Western Riding is a {{competitive}} event at American horse shows, particularly those for stock horse breeds {{such as the}} American Quarter Horse. It {{is not to be}} confused with the general term [...] "western riding," [...] referring to the many forms of equestrianism where riders use a western saddle; instead, it refers to a particular class where the horse and rider complete a pattern that incorporates elements of both reining and trail classes, but requiring horses to perform in a quiet style akin to that of a Western pleasure class. Horses are evaluated on “quality of gaits, lead changes at the lope, response to the rider, manners and disposition." [...] While all three gaits are required, most of the pattern is performed at a lope. Emphasis is placed on the horse's smoothness, even cadence, and precise, clean <b>flying</b> <b>lead</b> changes.|$|E

5000|$|Freestyle reining {{allows a}} horse and rider team to {{incorporate}} reining movements into a three and one-half minute musical routine, akin to the KUR Freestyle competition in Dressage, but with elements that resemble the freestyle events in human competitions such as figure skating. Under NRHA rules, costumes are allowed, though not required; riders may ride with one, two or even no hands on any type of NRHA approved bit; props, within certain limits, are allowed; and the show management may allow special arena lighting. Freestyle reining competitions have no specific rules as to saddle, though humane equipment is required. Allowing [...] "no hands" [...] means that some competitors may perform without a bridle, which increases {{the difficulty of the}} movements. The rider must include a specified number of spins, stops and <b>flying</b> <b>lead</b> changes in a performance. Rollbacks, rein backs and dressage type maneuvers such as the half-pass may be added and scored. Competitors are judged on technical merit and artistic impression. At some competitions, an applause meter is added and may contribute to the artistic impression portion of the score.|$|E
5000|$|Villeneuve was {{the first}} leader of the RCAF Golden Hawks jet fighter {{aerobatic}} demonstration team in 1959, and then again in 1960. S/L Villeneuve was with the Hawks from the beginning in 1959 {{as leader of the}} team, moving to <b>flying</b> the <b>lead</b> position when F/L Jim McCombe became the leader. He had to leave the team when he became married, under the Hawks rule of only two years for married men. [...] He then went on to Training Command.

50|$|Circles: {{the horse}} must perform large, fast circles at a near-gallop and smaller, slow circles at a lope. They should be {{perfectly}} round, with the rider dictating {{the pace of}} the horse. There should be an easily seen change of speed as the rider transitions from the large, fast to the small, slow circles. Most circles incorporate changes of direction that require a <b>flying</b> change of <b>lead.</b>|$|R
