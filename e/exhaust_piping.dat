2500|$|A {{peripheral}} {{intake port}} gives the highest mean effective pressure, however, side intake porting produces a more steady idle, {{because it helps}} to prevent blow-back of burned gases into the intake ducts which cause [...] "misfirings", caused by alternating cycles where the mixture ignites and fails to ignite. Peripheral porting (PP) gives the best mean effective pressure throughout the rpm range, but PP was linked also to worse idle stability and part-load performance. Early work by Toyota led to {{the addition of a}} fresh air supply to the exhaust port, and proved also that a Reed-valve in the intake port or ducts improved the low rpm and partial load performance of Wankel engines, by preventing blow-back of exhaust gas into the intake port and ducts, and reducing the misfire-inducing high EGR, at the cost of a small loss of power at top rpm. David W. Garside, the developer of the Norton rotary engine, who proposed that earlier opening of the intake port before top dead center (TDC), and longer intake ducts, improved low rpm torque and elasticity of Wankel engines. That is also described in Kenichi Yamamoto's books. Elasticity is also improved with a greater rotor eccentricity, analogous to a longer stroke in a reciprocating engine. Wankel engines operate better with a low-pressure exhaust system. Higher exhaust back pressure reduces mean effective pressure, more severely in peripheral intake port engines. The Mazda RX-8 Renesis engine improved performance by doubling the exhaust port area compared with earlier designs, and there has been specific study of the effect of intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>piping</b> configuration on the performance of Wankel engines.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{detectable}} by {{the presence}} of a black ooze around the <b>exhaust</b> manifold, <b>piping</b> and turbocharger, if fitted. It can be mistaken for lubricating oil in some cases, but it consists of the [...] "heavy ends" [...] of the diesel fuel which do not burn when combustion temperature is too low. The heavier, more oily components of diesel fuel contain more stored energy than a comparable quantity of, say, gasoline, but diesel requires an adequate loading of the engine in order to keep combustion temperature high enough to make use of it. Often, one can hear a slight miss in the engine due to fuel buildup. When the engine is first placed under a load after long periods of idling and wetstacking it may blow some black exhaust out as it burns that excess fuel off. Continuous black exhaust from the stack when under a constant load is also an indication that all the fuel is not being burned.|$|R

40|$|The correct {{management}} of the fuel supply involves commercial and technical implications as well as safety issues. The present paper deals with the possible malfunctions of two strokes (2 T) slow speed Diesel engines and the wearing effects on cylinder liners caused by the fuel quality. The study is based on theory, data available in literature and on a test case. In particular heavy and residual fuels having worse properties {{with respect to the}} ones required by the engine manufacturer have been examined. The combustion process of these fuels has been examined in detail, aiming to find the parameters giving malfunctioning and wearing effects. The relationship between the characteristics of the fuel and wearing, damages and malfunctions are quite complex and it is not always possible to give clear and unique explanations. However, the present work sets an interpretation key of the phenomena. A sequence of the events, linked by cause-effect relationships, is proposed, which is able to explain how the fuel viscosity and some related parameters could wear the engine cylinder liners and cause malfunctions. Such general scheme is supported by some numerical simulations and applied to the case study. Some mathematical models relevant to single steps of the process available in literature have been applied and calibrated in order to obtain results in agreement with experimental data. Shortly, {{it can be said that}} combustion parameters, influenced also by fuel properties and causing wearing and malfunctions, are: increase of the mean diameter of droplets after fuel injection, increase of the gradient of the injection pressure, increase of the ignition delay, increase of the maximum combustion pressure, increase of the non-burnt fuel particles and ashes. The main consequences are the increase of the wearing of liners, exhaust valves and in general of the whole <b>exhaust</b> turbo-charger <b>piping...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Harrison grew to {{be a large}} vehicle, {{eventually}} {{having a}} wheelbase of 10 ft. The 1906 and 1907 models featured a self-starting system which introduced acetylene into the proper cylinder for starting 'on the spark'.

5000|$|The bow {{planes were}} moved to the massive sail {{to cut down on}} flow-induced noise near the bow sonar arrays. They were known as sail planes or fairwater planes.

5000|$|American surface-ship VLSs {{have the}} missile cells {{arranged}} in a grid with one lid per cell and are [...] "hot launch" [...] systems; the engine ignites within the cell during the launch, and thus it requires <b>exhaust</b> <b>piping</b> for the missile flames and gasses. France, Italy and Britain use a similar hot-launching Sylver system in PAAMS. Russia produces both grid systems and a revolver design {{with more than one}} missile per lid. Russia also uses a cold launch system for some of its vertical launch missile systems, e.g., the Tor missile system. The People's Republic of China uses a circular [...] "cold launch" [...] system that ejects the missile from the launch tube before igniting the engine on the Type 052C destroyer, and also a rectangular ”hot launch" [...] system with one lid per cell {{arranged in a}} grid on the Type 054A frigate.|$|E
50|$|A 125-horsepower (93 kW) 4-cylinder {{engine was}} {{offered in the}} DX and LX models (F22A1), while the 1990 and 1991 EX {{received}} a 130 hp (97 kW) version (F22A4). Cruise control was dropped from the DX sedan, with air conditioning remaining a dealer-installed option. The LX kept the same features as the previous generation including air conditioning, power windows, door locks, and mirrors. The 90-91 EX added 5 horsepower due to a different exhaust manifold design, slightly larger <b>exhaust</b> <b>piping</b> and a twin outlet muffler. 15-inch machined aluminum-alloy wheels, sunroof, upgraded upholstery, rear stabilizer bar and a high-power 4-speaker stereo cassette were standard on all EX models. Some models though rare were special ordered with an anti-lock braking system (at that time abbreviated as ALB, now all automakers {{refer to it as}} ABS). A redesigned manual transmission with a hydraulic clutch was standard equipment in all trims while an all-new electronically controlled 4-speed automatic transmission was optional for all models.|$|E
50|$|For 1951 two {{new cars}} were built with {{improvements}} to the brakes, steering and fuel tanks, and were entered into the team's first full Championship Grand Prix at Silverstone. Problems with the cars prevented them setting qualifying times, but both cars were ready to start from the back. The exhausts of the cars had been designed to run within the bodywork, but with this being the first race the cars had run to a full Grand Prix length the drivers found themselves dealing with almost unbearable heat within the cockpit, {{to the point that}} they had to have burns dressings applied during pitstops to act as insulation and protect the arms from the hot <b>exhaust</b> <b>piping.</b> With the thought of all the effort that had gone into the project Parnell and Walker steeled themselves to struggle on to the finish and came home in fifth and seventh, albeit several laps down on the winning Ferrari of José Froilán González.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary and}} {{secondary}} heat exchangers are constructed of materials that will withstand this acidity, typically aluminum or stainless steel. Since the final exhaust from a condensing boiler has a lower temperature than the exhaust from an atmospheric boiler 38°C (100°F) vs. 204°C (400°F) a mechanical fan is always required to expel it, with the additional benefit of allowing the use of low-temperature <b>exhaust</b> <b>piping</b> (typically PVC in domestic applications) without insulation or conventional chimney requirements. Indeed, the use of conventional masonry chimney, or metal flue is specifically prohibited due to the corrosive nature of the flue products, with the notable exception of specially rated stainless steel and aluminum in certain models. The preferred/common vent material for most condensing boilers available in North America is PVC, followed by ABS and CPVC. Polymer venting allows for {{the added benefit of}} flexibility of installation location including sidewall venting saving unnecessary penetrations of the roof.|$|E
50|$|The fourth {{category}} of furnace is the high-efficiency, or condensing furnace. High-efficiency furnaces can achieve from 89% to 98% fuel efficiency. This style of furnace includes a sealed combustion area, combustion draft inducer and a secondary heat exchanger. Because the heat exchanger removes {{most of the}} heat from the exhaust gas, it actually condenses water vapor and other chemicals (which form a mild acid) as it operates. The vent pipes are normally installed with PVC pipe versus metal vent pipe to prevent corrosion. The draft inducer allows for the <b>exhaust</b> <b>piping</b> to be routed vertically or horizontally as it exits the structure. The most efficient arrangement for high-efficiency furnaces include PVC piping that brings fresh combustion air from the outside of the home directly to the furnace. Normally the combustion air (fresh air) PVC is routed alongside the exhaust PVC during installation and the pipes exit through a sidewall of the home in the same location. High efficiency furnaces typically deliver a 25% to 35% fuel savings over a 60% AFUE furnace.|$|E
5000|$|The {{decision}} {{to begin work}} on the first stationary gas chambers in the General Government preceded the actual Wannsee Conference by three months. The site near Bełżec was chosen for several reasons: it was situated {{on the border between}} the Lublin District and the German Distrikt Galizien formed after Operation Barbarossa. It could [...] "process" [...] the Jews of both regions. The ease of transportation was secured by the railroad junction at nearby Rawa Ruska and the highway between Lublin-Stadt and Lemberg. The northern boundary of the planned killing centre consisted of an anti-tank trench constructed a year earlier. The ditch, excavated originally for military purposes was likely to serve as the first mass grave. Globocnik brought in Obersturmführer Richard Thomalla who was a civil engineer by profession and the camp construction expert in the SS. Work had commenced in early November 1941, using local builders overseen by a squad of Trawniki guards. The installation, resembling a railway transit point for the purpose of forced labour, was finished before Christmas. It featured insulated barracks for showering among several other structures. Some local men were released. The SS completed the work in February 1942 by fitting in the tank engine and the <b>exhaust</b> <b>piping</b> systems for gassing. The trial killings were performed in early March.|$|E

With a compression ratio of 11.0:1, 87.0 mm bore x 90.7 mm stroke and VTEC-valve timing, lift and duration were adjusted to 12.2 mm intake and 11.2 mm exhaust. Honda also overhauled the air box {{and replaced it with}} a more efficient design that {{is often referred to as}} Dynamic Chambering, along with a larger throttle body design bored to 62 mm (as opposed to the previous 60 mm).

The gearing on the Type S matches all other fifth-generation Preludes that had a manual transmission except for the five-speed 2.2 VTi VTEC and had a final drive ratio of 4.266:1. The Type S had an Active Control ABS system, different from the others which had the standard ABS systems. The interior featured newly developed synthentic materials called Cabron and Excene to upholster the seats which most people see it as leather and alcantara laced with red stitching. Manufacturer styling options included seat lettering. The exterior styling of fifth generation Preludes was standardized for most models. All had a sunroof except for the Type S model.|$|E
