However, scholar Bistra Nikolova considers it improbable that an ordinary village cemetery church {{would have an}} inscription by a Bulgarian tsar. In her opinion, {{it is more likely}} that the church was constructed by a noble person related to the court of the Second Bulgarian Empire.|$|E

5|$|London's vast {{urban area}} <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>described</b> using {{a set of}} {{district}} names, such as Bloomsbury, Mayfair, Wembley and Whitechapel. These are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or former boroughs.|$|E

5|$|The most {{distinctive}} feature of Saurolophus is its cranial crest, which {{is present in}} young individuals, but is smaller. It is long and spike-like and projects upward and backward at about a 45° angle, starting from over the eyes. This crest <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>described</b> as solid, but appears to be solid only at the point, with internal chambers that {{may have had a}} respiratory and/or heat-regulation function.|$|E
5|$|According to the Shyamaladandakam, Matangi plays a ruby-studded veena {{and speaks}} sweetly.

5|$|Conscience is an aptitude, faculty, intuition or {{judgment}} that assists in distinguishing right from wrong. Moral judgment may derive from values or norms (principles and rules). In psychological terms conscience <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>described</b> as leading {{to feelings of}} remorse when a human commits actions that go against his/her moral values and to feelings of rectitude or integrity when actions conform to such norms. The extent to which conscience informs moral judgment before an action and whether such moral judgments are or should be based in reason has occasioned debate {{through much of the}} history of Western philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Growing in {{woodland}} among moss, {{plant detritus}} or other habitats, the L.lubrica fruit bodies are typically found in large numbers, though they can grow in tight clumps or even individually. The species feeds as a saprotroph. The youngest fruit bodies {{are small and}} conical, but the fertile head quickly grows from the stalk. It <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>described</b> as inedible, despite its common name, but has also been reported as edible and even good. L.lubrica has been recorded in Europe, North America, Asia and Australasia.|$|E
5|$|Matangi <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>described</b> as an outcaste and impure. Her {{association}} with pollution mainly streams from her relation to outcaste communities, {{considered to be}} polluted in Hindu society. These social groups deal in occupations deemed inauspicious and polluted like collection of waste, meat-processing and working in cremation grounds. In a Nepali context, such groups are collectively called Matangi, who collect waste—including human waste—and other inauspicious things, and often live outside villages. Thus she is associated with death, pollution, inauspiciousness and the periphery of Hindu society.|$|E

5|$|Most generally, State Shinto {{refers to}} any use of Shinto {{practices}} {{incorporated into the}} national ideology during the Meiji period starting in 1868. It <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>described</b> as any state-supported, Shinto-inspired ideology or practice intended to inspire national integration, unity, and loyalty. State Shinto is also understood {{to refer to the}} state rituals and ideology of Emperor-worship, which was not a traditional emphasis of Shinto — of the 124 Japanese emperors, only 20 have dedicated shrines.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>described</b> {{in terms}} of {{positive}} and negative (or deficit) symptoms. Positive symptoms are those that most individuals do not normally experience, but are present in people with schizophrenia. They can include delusions, disordered thoughts and speech, and tactile, auditory, visual, olfactory and gustatory hallucinations, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis. Hallucinations are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme. Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{works of}} Japanese literature include the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki chronicles and the Man'yōshū poetry anthology, {{all from the}} 8th century and written in Chinese characters. In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as kana (Hiragana and Katakana) was developed. The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter is considered the oldest Japanese narrative. An account of Heian court life is given in The Pillow Book by Sei Shōnagon, while The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>described</b> as the world's first novel.|$|E

5|$|The {{island is}} formed of Carboniferous Limestone and <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>described</b> as geologically a {{continuation}} of the Mendip Hills at Brean Down; however, the dip is at a different angle to that on Brean Down. On Steep Holm the dip is about 30 degrees to the north whereas at Brean Down it is 30 degrees to the south. There are some folds and fractures with dip angles up to 75 degrees created during the final phases of the Variscan orogeny {{near the end of the}} Carboniferous Period, 300million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The jaguar <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>described</b> as nocturnal, but is more {{specifically}} crepuscular (peak activity around dawn and dusk). Both sexes hunt, but males travel farther each day than females, befitting their larger territories. The jaguar may hunt {{during the day}} if game is available and is a relatively energetic feline, spending as much as 50–60 percent of its time active. The jaguar's elusive nature and the inaccessibility of much of its preferred habitat make it a difficult animal to sight, let alone study.|$|E
5|$|The screenplay, {{written by}} Pintilie, {{was based on}} the Petru Dumitriu's novel Cronică de familie ("Family Chronicle"), and in {{particular}} on its chapter Salata ("The Salad"), which <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>described</b> as a stand-alone novella. Reportedly, the director wished to use Salata as the film's title, but the name was imposed on him during production. An Unforgettable Summer differs from the original story by adding an English education to Marie-Thérèse Von Debretsy's background, in what American film critic John Simon indicates is intended to explain the Oxford accent Scott Thomas uses in her Romanian-language lines, and to allow the actress to express herself in English during several scenes.|$|E
