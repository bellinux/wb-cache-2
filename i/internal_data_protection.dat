40|$|The dual {{problems}} of respecting citizen privacy {{and protecting the}} confidentiality of their data have become hopelessly conflated in the “Big Data” era. There are orders of magnitude more data outside an agency’s firewall than inside it—compromising the integrity of traditional statistical disclosure limitation methods. And increasingly the information processed by the agency was “asked” in a context wholly outside the agency’s operations—blurring the distinction between what was asked and what is published. Already, private businesses like Microsoft, Google and Apple recognize that cybersecurity (safeguarding the integrity and access controls for <b>internal</b> <b>data)</b> and privacy <b>protection</b> (ensuring that what is published does not reveal too much about any person or business) are {{two sides of the}} same coin.

It wants to upgrade its legal arrangement on personal <b>data</b> <b>protection.</b> Accordingly, Chinese legislators consider cloning European <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> law. The plan raises a number of questions: Can European <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> law {{improve the quality of}} <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> in China? If so, how do the historic and cultural contexts matter for <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> laws unfolding in Europe and in China? Chinese policymakers assume that the european <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> law is complete, but it is not. How should China process the EU experiences to achieve a positive impact for how personal data are deployed and protected in the commercial world? In this book, these questions are examined. The book synthesizes dogmatic and empirical discussions and establishes that the subject matter of <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> law exhibits the characteristics of a complex adaptive system. It is aruged that complexity and legal theories provide a toolbox to improve exploration of <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> laws, its functions and its dynamics.
