5|$|The {{traditional}} Scouting {{divisions are}} Cub Scouting for boys ages 7 to 11 years, Boy Scouting for boys ages 11 to 18 and Venturing {{for young men}} and women ages 14 (or 13 and having completed the 8th grade) through 21. Learning for Life is a non-traditional subsidiary that provides in-school and career education. Starting in 2018, <b>girls</b> <b>will</b> be allowed to join Cub Scout dens, and in 2019, programs for older <b>girls</b> <b>will</b> allow for a path to earn the rank of Eagle Scout.|$|E
5|$|Channel 4 {{gave the}} {{programme}} the working title <b>Girls</b> <b>Will</b> Be Boys and Boys Will Be Girls. Mark Raphael, the commissioning editor for documentaries, contracted a British production company called Twenty Twenty Productions {{to make the}} series. Twenty Twenty {{was at the time}} a subsidiary of Shed Media. Former commissioning editor for documentaries Meredith Chambers served as executive producer for Channel 4, and Sam Whittaker was executive producer for Twenty Twenty. The series producer and director was Helen Richards.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, it {{was found}} that {{families}} failed to seek medical treatment for their daughters because of the stigma associated with negative medical histories. A study conducted by Pednekar et al. in 2011 found that out of 100 boys and girls with congenital heart disease, 70 boys would have an operation while only 22 <b>girls</b> <b>will</b> receive similar treatment.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the BSA's Learning for Life, {{membership}} in the traditional BSA programs has been more restricted and controversial. Until recently, girls {{were not allowed to}} join Cub Scouting or Boy Scouting, but could join Venturing and Sea Scouting; women can be adult volunteers in all programs. On October 11, 2017, the BSA announced that girls would be allowed to become Cub Scouts, starting in 2018, and that in 2019, a separate program for older <b>girls</b> <b>will</b> be available, enabling girls to earn the rank of Eagle Scout.|$|E
5|$|Later, Black is {{informed}} that the girls are missing. She and Means search the woods, finding the girls in a grotto. They are with a teacher from the school, Ben Fisher (John Pyper-Ferguson) who attacks Means; she subdues him and he is arrested. She later confronts him, and it is revealed {{he is a former}} Group member charged with protecting the girls due to their powers. When Black later learns that Fisher has been released, she fears for McKenna's life. She rushes to the school, knowing the <b>girls</b> <b>will</b> be at a prayer meeting. She arrives just too late to prevent Alex from firing upon the meeting; Fisher is killed while shielding McKenna. Later, Means shows Black two sets of DNA test results—one from McKenna, the other from the Shroud of Turin. The profiles seem to prove that McKenna is related to Jesus Christ; Means entrusts them, and the decision as to whether to proliferate them, to Black.|$|E

25|$|With {{glucocorticoid}} and mineralocorticoid replacement, these <b>girls</b> <b>will</b> {{reach the}} age of puberty. Because the ovaries are relatively inactive in fetal life and childhood, they sustain little damage from lipid accumulation during childhood. In the case of lipoid CAH due to StAR deficiency, when rising gonadotropin levels initiate puberty, despite the inefficiency of sex steroid synthesis, the ovaries will usually make enough estradiol to produce breast development, {{and in some cases}} even menarche, with menses continuing for some years. Ovarian and adrenal androgen production is minimal and produces little pubic or other body hair.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{countries}} with the smallest female labour force is developing technical and vocational education for girls {{as part of a}} wider scheme to reduce dependence on foreign labour. By 2017, the Technical and Vocational Training Corporation of Saudi Arabia is to have constructed 50 technical colleges, 50 girls’ higher technical institutes and 180 industrial secondary institutes. The plan is to create training placements for about 500 000 students, half of them girls. Boys and <b>girls</b> <b>will</b> be trained in vocational professions that include information technology, medical equipment handling, plumbing, electricity and mechanics.|$|E
25|$|The girls grow {{increasingly}} sick as {{a result}} of using the spells, and Subaru tries once more to save them. Seishirō appears, claiming that none of the girls can be saved. Subaru and Seishirō fight, only to ultimately be stopped by the appearance of the ghost of Hokuto Sumeragi, who asks them to stop for her sake. Seishirō leaves, and the fight is unresolved. At the end, Kurumi says that, hopefully, all the other <b>girls</b> <b>will</b> be able to give up their vengeful plans and become good again. Subaru adds finally that he wishes for the same thing.|$|E

25|$|Officially the {{government}} of Pakistan is committed to provide every citizen an access to education, but critics say that its budget allocation towards education does not correspond with its former commitment. The expenditure on education {{as a percentage of}} GDP was 1.82% in 2000–2001, while it has been raised slightly in 2006–2007 to 2.42%, and it is still relatively lower than most neighboring countries. Feminist economists argue that {{the government}} of Pakistan needs to fully address and resolve the gender concerns that exist in the educational sector. They suggest that one of the ways to improve this situation is by increasing funding for women's education, encourage and financially incentivize people in the rural areas to send their girls to schools. In the apprentice of gender studies, the gender division of labor is considered patriarchal, and feminists argue that it can be consciously neutralized by the public policies, i.e. encouraging girls to study mathematics, science, computers, and business administration etc. This way, <b>girls</b> <b>will</b> specialize in higher paying fields (jobs) instead of solely focusing on care work.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of Orthodox and some Conservative Jews reject {{the idea that}} a woman can publicly read from the Torah or lead prayer services whenever there is a minyan (quorum of 10 males) available to do so. However, the public celebration of a girl becoming bat mitzvah in other ways has made strong inroads into Modern Orthodox Judaism and also into some elements of Haredi Judaism. In these congregations, women do not read from the Torah or lead prayer services, but they occasionally lecture on a Jewish topic to mark their coming of age, learn a book of Tanakh, recite verses from the Book of Esther or the Book of Psalms, or say prayers from the siddur. In some Modern Orthodox circles, bat mitzvah <b>girls</b> <b>will</b> read from the Torah and lead prayer services in a women's tefillah. Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, a prominent Orthodox posek, has ruled that bat mitzvah celebrations are permissible, but should not be held in a synagogue, because then they would be construed as imitating Reform and Conservative customs; in any case, {{they do not have the}} status of seudat mitzvah. Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef holds that it is a seudat mitzvah.|$|E

500|$|Faust {{noted the}} cynicism about the brony fandom, and commented that in {{considering}} the idea of grown men watching a show for little girls, [...] "They think there's something wrong with that, something devious about it"; she noted that it was [...] "upsetting to me that people jump to those conclusions". Faust believes that her future animated shows aimed at <b>girls</b> <b>will</b> be easier to sell considering the male adult fandom of Friendship Is Magic, and that that type of programming is not as great a risk as is perceived. After Hasbro issued a cease and desist to the Fighting Is Magic project {{over the use of}} copyrighted and trademarked characters, Faust offered to provide the developers with original character arts to allow them to continue to develop the game without copyright issues.|$|E
500|$|A Free Rides opening intertitle {{denotes the}} film's setting as [...] "in the wide open spaces, where men are men and <b>girls</b> <b>will</b> be girls, the hills {{are full of}} romance and adventure". The film shows two women walking {{together}} alongside a road near their home. A wealthy male motorist in a right-hand-drive 1912 Haynes 50-60 Model Y Touring Car arrives and offers them a lift. After some hesitation, the women accept his offer and sit beside him in the front seat. The man then kisses and fondles them. Later, as he urinates behind a tree, the women voyeuristically watch him. When {{he is about to}} finish, the women quickly return to the car. After his return, the women urinate behind the tree while the man secretly watches them and becomes sexually aroused. The women return to the car and the man offers them a drink.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the first}} episode aired, {{journalist}} Patrick Strudwick asked, [...] "Channel 4, why call your new documentary My Transsexual Summer? It sounds like gender tourism, a fun little trip to the other side." [...] Sarah Dean, an entertainment editor for The Huffington Post UK, called the title [...] "sensationalist". Although Sarah Lake of Trans Media Watch found the title contentious, she defended it {{by pointing out that}} transition is a temporary process like coming of age; even so, she believed the title to be [...] "only slightly better" [...] than the [...] "dire and totally inappropriate" [...] working title, <b>Girls</b> <b>Will</b> Be Boys and Boys Will Be Girls. Her overall assessment was that [...] "although the programme makers undeniably made some compromises to draw in viewers, millions will have enjoyed the company of these seven, shared in their lives and learned a lesson in diversity.… They will now have an entry point to broadening their understanding of the rich and joyful diversity of gender experience, something which has always existed but of which they were previously unaware." ...|$|E
