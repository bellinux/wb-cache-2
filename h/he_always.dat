5|$|He {{was educated}} in the Episcopal Church, to which <b>he</b> <b>always</b> adhered; and my {{conviction}} is, that he believed in the fundamental doctrines of Christianity as usually taught in that Church, according to his understanding of them; but without a particle of intolerance, or disrespect for the faith and modes of worship adopted by Christians of other denominations.|$|E

By conquering the Persian Empire and unifying Greece, Egypt and Babylon, he forged the largest empire of the ancient world and effected the spread of Hellenism throughout Europe and Northern Africa.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was never}} a {{vigorous}} apologist for that tradition, <b>he</b> <b>always</b> maintained the standards of clarity and rigour which it prizes, and his work {{is a model of}} all that is best in the tradition. It is brilliant, deep, and imaginative. It is also extraordinarily tight. There cannot be many critics of his work who have not thought of some objection to what he says, only to find, on looking for a relevant quotation to turn into a target, that Williams carefully presents his views in a way that precisely anticipates the objection.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} by, Vainio {{consumed}} {{more and more}} alcohol. In the late 1960s he frequented Tapion Tuoppi with Gunnar Mattsson and Aarre Elo. He often carried a hip flask in case {{he ran out of}} something to drink. Vainio's deteriorating family relationships are considered to be one reason for his drinking.

5|$|Despite {{his large}} number of works on Christian themes, Britten has {{sometimes}} been thought of as agnostic. Pears said that when they met in 1937 {{he was not sure}} whether or not Britten would have described himself as a Christian. In the 1960s Britten called himself a dedicated Christian, though sympathetic to the radical views propounded by the Bishop of Woolwich in Honest to God. Politically, Britten was on the left. He told Pears that <b>he</b> <b>always</b> voted either Liberal or Labour and could not imagine ever voting Conservative, but he was never a member of any party, except the Peace Pledge Union.|$|E

In 1903, he supported his son-in-law, Morris Belknap, for governor against Goebel's lieutenant governor, J. C. W. Beckham. When the Democrats again nominated William Jennings Bryan in the 1908 presidential election, Buckner openly supported Bryan's opponent, Republican William Howard Taft.|$|E

From 1926, when Lloyd George became leader of the Liberals, Keynes took a major role in defining the party's economics policy, but by then the Liberals had been displaced into third party status by the Labour Party.|$|E
