[...] Chain of Mystery utilized a frame concept that had never been done before. Using a jig as a guide, the heavy links of a chain, normally used for towing heavy vehicles, were welded together until the frame took shape (the shop's Eddie Mcgarry was the project welder).

[...] Zeus intended to make him the ruler of the universe but the jealous Titans lured the child away, tore him to pieces, cooked him and ate him. [...] Athena preserved his heart, however, which Zeus swallowed. [...] According to Boslooper, Clement omitted one part of the myth that forms a connection between his account and the Theban legend of Dionysus. [...] Because Zeus swallowed the heart of Dionysus Zagreus, when Semele bore Dionysus the new god was Zagreus reborn.|$|E
2500|$|In early 2016, Khan {{was seen}} in a {{supporting}} role in Shakun Batra's family drama Kapoor & Sons. The film, which featured Khan with an ensemble cast including Rishi Kapoor, Ratna Pathak Shah, Rajat Kapoor, Sidharth Malhotra, and Alia Bhatt, became a commercial success upon its release, and Khan received almost unanimously positive reviews from critics for his portrayal of Rahul Kapoor, a writer who is revealed to be a closeted homosexual. Bollywood Hungama's review praised Khan's performance saying, [...] "As far as performances are concerned, the film totally belongs to Fawad Khan, Ratna Pathak Shah and Rajat Kapoor." [...] It continued, [...] "He surprises everyone with his exceptionally sensitive performance that can be rightly termed as a 'straight-from-the-heart' act. The emotional bond that his character develops with the audiences {{is so strong that}} almost everyone will want to have a son and a brother like him." [...] Writing for NDTV, Saibal Chaterjee said, [...] "On the acting front, Fawad Khan steals the show with an impressively modulated, confident performance as an achiever condemned to perpetually carry the burden of expectation and hide his true self behind a wall of falsehoods." [...] Kapoor & Sons also earned him the Diversity Award at Indian Film Festival of Melbourne. Six actors, including Karan Johar, rejected the role of Rahul Kapoor. The film's producer said, [...] "We went to six actors and after six rejections, I told Shakun Batra (director) that we should drop the idea and he started developing another screenplay. Later, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> thought Fawad came to my mind. I sent him the script, he loved it and said he would do it." [...] Later in 2016, he appeared in a small role opposite Ranbir Kapoor, Anushka Sharma, and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in Karan Johar's romantic drama Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. Critics noted that Khan's role was too short to judge. Raja Sen of Rediff.com said, [...] "As the princely DJ, Fawad Khan has far too little to do in this film —though even a role with him on-screen throughout the film wouldn't have justified the ridiculous kerfuffle his casting has caused — but looks perfect for the part." [...] Subhash K. Jha of Deccan Chronicle wrote, [...] "Fawad's entry is welcome and his exit baffling. Why does he reject Anushka’s love? If you are a Fawad fan, his meagre presence and sketchy role would infuriate you." [...] Following the Uri terror attack, bilateral relations between India and Pakistan took a downturn resulting in the Indian Motion Picture Producers Association (IMPPA) and The Film Producers Guild of India deciding to ban all Pakistani artists from working in India until the situation normalises.|$|E
