5|$|Kiedis {{knew that}} the band's sound would inevitably change when Navarro joined. In June 1994, the band entered The Sound Factory, a {{recording}} studio in Los Angeles, to record the album. The band completed a few basic tracks, when Kiedis began having difficulty singing. He had been through a <b>dental</b> <b>procedure</b> in which an addictive sedative, Valium, was used; this caused him to relapse, and he once again became dependent on drugs. Kiedis had slipped from five years of sobriety and began reusing narcotics he'd sworn never to use again. The band took a short break from recording to perform at Woodstock '94, {{which was the first}} show Navarro played with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.|$|E

25|$|Morton {{at first}} {{attempted}} {{to hide the}} actual nature of his anesthetic substance, referring to it as Letheon. He received a US patent for his substance, but news of the successful anesthetic spread quickly by late 1846. Respected surgeons in Europe including Liston, Dieffenbach, Pirogov, and Syme quickly undertook numerous operations with ether. An American-born physician, Boott, encouraged London dentist James Robinson to perform a <b>dental</b> <b>procedure</b> on a Miss Lonsdale. This was the first case of an operator-anesthetist. On the same day, 19 December 1846, in Dumfries Royal Infirmary, Scotland, a Dr. Scott used ether for a surgical procedure. The first use of anesthesia in the Southern Hemisphere took place in Launceston, Tasmania, that same year. Drawbacks with ether such as excessive vomiting and its explosive flammability led to its replacement in England with chloroform.|$|E

50|$|In a July 2009 {{interview}} Commander Kenneth Bell {{said that}} it took several times longer to treat captives as it did to treat guards, for similar <b>dental</b> <b>procedures,</b> because captives didn't understand why the <b>dental</b> <b>procedures</b> were {{in the interest of}} their health.He said <b>dental</b> <b>procedures</b> were never performed on the captives, without their consent.|$|R
2500|$|Navarro first {{appeared}} {{with the band}} at Woodstock '94. The band opened their set wearing enormous light bulb costumes attached precariously to chrome metallic suits, making it near-impossible for them to play their instruments. Navarro hated the idea but went with it. The performance saw the debut of new songs such as [...] "Warped", [...] "Aeroplane", and [...] "Pea" [...] although the songs were in the beginning stages and the lyrics were {{very different from the}} final versions. The band followed up their performance at Woodstock with a brief tour, which included headlining appearances at the Pukkelpop and Reading Festivals as well two performances as the opening act for The Rolling Stones. According to Kiedis, however, opening for the Stones was a horrible experience. While externally, the band appeared to be settled, the relationship between the three established members and Navarro had begun to deteriorate. His differing musical background made performing difficult as they began playing together, and continued to be an issue over the next year. Navarro admitted he did not care for funk music or jamming. Kiedis was also struggling with his heroin addiction; he had been through a <b>dental</b> <b>procedure</b> in Beverly Hills, in which an addictive sedative, Valium, was used; this caused him to relapse, and he once again became dependent on drugs, although the band would not find this out until later.|$|E

40|$|Background: Asthma is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} {{condition of the}} airways. Pain and anxiety triggered by dental treatment can induce the secretion of endogenous catecholamines. When the situation is combined {{with the use of}} local anesthetics with vasoconstrictors, it may increase its undesirable effects on the cardiovascular system and respiratory systems. Aim of the work: To evaluate the effects of <b>dental</b> <b>procedures</b> with and without local anesthesia on pulmonary function and arterial oxygen saturation in healthy volunteers and asthmatic patients. Patients and methods: Our study included 30 asthmatic patients, and 20 healthy volunteers. Careful history taking, clinical examination, spirometry and pulse oximetry to measure O 2 saturation before and 10 Â min after <b>dental</b> <b>procedures</b> were obtained. Results: Pulmonary function showed a statistically significant decrease in PEF and O 2 saturation in asthmatic patients and a statistically significant decrease in O 2 saturation in the healthy group after <b>dental</b> <b>procedures</b> compared to pre-procedure results. Asthmatic patients receiving local anesthesia had a statistically significant decrease in PEF and O 2 saturation after <b>dental</b> <b>procedures</b> compared to pre-procedure results. In the healthy group, there was a statistically significant decrease in O 2 saturation after dental filling and dental prosthesis and in asthmatic patients after dental filling, extraction, prosthesis, and scaling compared to that before. Conclusion: Asthmatic patients may be at a higher risk of developing oxygen desaturation after <b>dental</b> <b>procedures</b> regardless of their type with and without local anesthesia and a decrease in PEF after <b>dental</b> <b>procedures</b> with local anesthesia...|$|R
