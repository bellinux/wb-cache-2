50|$|The most {{familiar}} kinds of bevel gears have pitch angles {{of less than}} 90 degrees and therefore are cone-shaped. This type of bevel gear is called external because the gear teeth point outward. The pitch surfaces of meshed <b>external</b> <b>bevel</b> gears are coaxial with the gear shafts; the apexes of the two surfaces are {{at the point of}} intersection of the shaft axes.|$|E
40|$|Idiopathic gingival fibromatosis (IGF) {{is a rare}} condition. It is genetically {{heterogeneous}} and {{is usually}} part of a syndrome or, rarely, an isolated disorder. This study presents a rare case of 13 year old boy who was diagnosed with isolated IGF. This diagnosis {{has been based on}} clinical examination and after ruling out family, drug, and medical histories. <b>External</b> <b>bevel</b> gingivectomy has been done to remove excess gingival tissues. Excised tissue has been examined histologically. The patient has been followed up for a period of two and half years. No recurrence has been observed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Idiopathic gingival {{enlargement}} {{is a type}} of gingival fibromatosis {{characterized by}} progressive overgrowth of the gingival tissues. This case report presented the clinical features of a typical idiopathic gingival enlargement which was treated with <b>external</b> <b>bevel</b> gingivactomy. The patient presented with generalized diffuse gingival enlargement involving the maxillary and mandibular arches extending on buccal and lingual/palatal surfaces and covering incisal/occlusal third of the tooth resulting in difficulty in speech and mastication since last three years. Gingivectomy was carried out to improve patient's quality of life. Since removal of hyperplastic gingival tissue eliminates difficulties in eating and speaking. Therefore, this surgical intervention improves access for plaque control, and leads to psychological benefits due to esthetic improvement. In this case, even after one year from following-up, no recurrence of gingival overgrowth was observed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{describes}} {{a study of}} a relative screw motion {{of a pair of}} internal and <b>external</b> spiral <b>bevel</b> gears with double circular-arc tooth profile in a nutation drive by screw theory and focuses on the kinematic modeling for the nutation drive. According to the instantaneous screw motion theory, the meshing function of the nutation drive for the kinematic modeling is developed based on the gear meshing theory and the coordinate system transformation between a crown gear and an internal or an <b>external</b> spiral <b>bevel</b> gear. The equations for the tooth profile of the crown gear, internal and <b>external</b> spiral <b>bevel</b> gears are further obtained based on the standard double circular-arc tooth profile and equal strength principles. Finally, the controllable precision three dimension modeling method for the tooth profile of the external and internal spiral bevel gears is further proposed...|$|R
40|$|Reattachment of the {{fractured}} anterior tooth {{is a highly}} conservative and aesthetic treatment that has gained popularity in the recent past. Presented here is one such {{case in which a}} combination of <b>external</b> enamel <b>bevel</b> and internal dentinal groove has been used to enhance the bonding between {{the fractured}} fragment and the remaining tooth. The treatment was found to be successful both functionally and aesthetically at the 18 -month follow-up...|$|R
25|$|Gashing is a {{machining}} process used {{to rough out}} coarse pitched gears and sprockets. It is commonly used on worm wheels before hobbing, but also used on internal and <b>external</b> spur gears, <b>bevel</b> gears, helical gears, and gear racks. The process is performed on gashers or universal milling machines, {{especially in the case}} of worm wheels. After gashing the gear or sprocket is finished via hobbing, shaping, or shaving.|$|R
40|$|Hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF) {{is a rare}} {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} a benign, non-hemorrhagic, fibrous gingival overgrowth that can appear in isolation {{or as part of}} a syndrome. Clinically, a pink gingiva with marked stippling can be seen to cover almost all the tooth, in many cases preventing eruption. HGF usually begins during the transition from primary to permanent teeth, giving rise to a condition that can have negative psychological effects at that age. As it does not resolve spontaneously, the treatment of choice is gingivectomy, which can be performed with an internal or <b>external</b> <b>bevel</b> incision, depending on each case and bearing in mind the changes that will take place at the dentogingival junction (DGJ). This paper describes clinical aspects and treatment in two eight-year-old boys with HGF, considering different facets of the surgical approach with conscious sedation in young children...|$|E
40|$|To {{appreciate}} any enhancement {{in speech}} following gingivectomy of enlarged anterior palatal gingiva. Periodontal literature has documented various conditions, pathophysiology, and treatment modalities of gingival enlargement. Relationship between gingival maladies and speech alteration has received scant attention. This case report describes on altered speech pattern enhancement {{secondary to the}} gingivectomy procedure. A systemically healthy 24 -year- female patient reported with bilateral anterior gingival enlargement who was provisionally diagnosed as "gingival abscess with inflammatory enlargement" in relation to palatal aspect of the right maxillary canine to left maxillary canine. Bilateral gingivectomy procedure was performed by <b>external</b> <b>bevel</b> incision in relation to anterior palatal gingiva and a large wedge of epithelium and connective tissue was removed. Patient and her close acquaintances noticed a great improvement in her pronunciation and enunciation of sounds like "t", "d", "n", "l", "th", following removal of excess gingival palatal tissue and was also appreciated with visual analog scale score. Exploration of linguistic research documented the significance of tongue-palate contact during speech. Any excess gingival tissue in palatal region brings about disruption in speech by altering tongue-palate contact. Periodontal surgery like gingivectomy may improve disrupted phonetics. Excess gingival palatal tissue impedes on tongue-palate contact and interferes speech. Pronunciation of consonants like "t", "d", "n", "l", "th", are altered with anterior enlarged palatal gingiva. Excision of the enlarged palatal tissue results in improvement of speech...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} in the NASA Ames 9 -Ft by 7 -Ft Supersonic and 11 -Ft by 11 -Ft Transonic Wind Tunnels of a 2. 7 % Reference H (Ref. H) Nacelle Airframe Interference (NAI) High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) model. NASA Ames did the experiment with the cooperation and assistance of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. The Ref. H geometry was designed by Boeing. The model was built and tested by NASA under a license agreement with Boeing. Detailed forces and pressures of individual components of the configuration were obtained to assess nacelle airframe interference through the transonic and supersonic flight regime. The test apparatus was capable of measuring forces and pressures of the Wing body (WB) and nacelles. Axisymmetric and 2 -D inlet nacelles were tested with the WB in both the in-proximity and captive mode. The in-proximity nacelles were mounted to a nacelle support system apparatus and were individually positioned. The right hand nacelles were force instrumented with flow through strain-gauged balances and the left hand nacelles were pressure instrumented. Mass flow ratio was varied to get steady state inlet unstart data. In addition, supersonic spillage data was taken by testing the 2 -D inlet nacelles with ramps and the axisymmetric inlet nacelles with an inlet centerbody for the Mach condition of interest. The captive nacelles, both axisymmetric and 2 -D, were attached to the WB via diverters. The captive 2 -D inlet nacelle was also tested with ramps to get supersonic spillage data. Boeing analyzed the data and showed a drag penalty of four drag counts for the 2 -D compared with the axisymmetric inlet nacelle. Two of the four counts were attributable to the <b>external</b> <b>bevel</b> designed into the 2 -D inlet contour. Boeing and McDonnell Douglas used these data for evaluating Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) codes and for evaluation of nacelle airframe integration problems and solutions...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} a contra bevel on the fracture resistance of teeth restored with cast post and core. Materials and Methods. Sixty plastic analogues of an upper incisor were endodontically treated and prepared with 6 ° internal taper and 2 [*]mm of ferrule in order to receive a cast post and core. The prepared samples were divided into two groups (n= 30); the first group serves as control while the second group was prepared with an <b>external</b> 30 ° <b>bevel</b> on the buccal and lingual walls. All samples crowned were exposed to a compressive load at 130 ° to their long axis until fractures occurred. Fracture resistance loads were recorded and failure modes were also observed. Mann-Whitney test was carried out to compare the two groups. Results. Mean failure loads for the groups were, respectively, 1038. 69 [*]N (SD ± 243. 52 [*]N) and 1078. 89 [*]N (SD ± 352. 21 [*]N). Statistically, {{there was no significant difference}} between the two groups (P= 0. 7675 > 0. 05). Conclusion. In the presence of a ferrule and a crown in the anterior teeth, adding a secondary ferrule to the cast post and core will not increase the resistance to fracture...|$|R
