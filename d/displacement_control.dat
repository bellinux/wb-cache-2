50|$|The {{stiffness}} matrix {{depends on the}} contact spring stiffness and the spring location. The {{stiffness matrix}} is for only one pair of contact springs. However, the global stiffness matrix is determined by summing up the stiffness matrices of individual pairs of springs around each element. Consequently, the developed stiffness matrix has total effects from all pairs of springs, according to the stress situation around the element. This technique {{can be used in}} both load and <b>displacement</b> <b>control</b> cases. The 3D stiffness matrix may be deduced similarly.|$|E

It is shown that the displacement demand of critical elements within a building can be insensitive to changes in eccentricity and torsional stiffness properties. While torsional actions is a well-researched topic, the incorporation of <b>displacement</b> <b>controlled</b> phenomenon into the analysis is original and represents a new development...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{accurate}} {{determination of}} the pressure to cause plastic collapse of a pipe is important when considering its structural integrity. This paper explores {{the way in which}} initial stresses, induced by either load or <b>displacement</b> <b>controlled</b> bending, influence plastic collapse as a result of internal pressure. Both open ended and closed ended pipes are considered. The effect of initial bending stresses created by far-field displacement is often considered to be similar to load controlled stresses. Using three dimensional finite element analysis it is demonstrated that global collapse pressures for load and <b>displacement</b> <b>controlled</b> conditions may be significantly different. For both pipe end conditions load controlled bending affects the plastic collapse pressure. However, <b>displacement</b> <b>controlled</b> bending has little influence...|$|R
40|$|Current {{efficiency}} {{measurements of}} variable hydraulic axial piston pumps are {{performed with the}} displacement system locked at maximum volume, thus without the controller. Therefore, the controller’s effect on the efficiency is not quantified at {{state of the art}} measurements. Former research on control systems mainly focused on the dynamic behaviour. This paper aims to quantify the losses in the <b>displacement</b> and <b>control</b> system and to research the dependencies of those. Therefore, a test rig is built up at IFAS to measure the <b>control</b> power of <b>displacement</b> <b>controlled</b> pumps. Furthermore, a simulation tool is developed to increase the understanding of the loss mechanisms of the investigated control systems. In conclusion, the paper shows the potential of efficiency improvements for <b>displacement</b> <b>controlled</b> pumps...|$|R
50|$|Analyzers {{are made}} for both stress (force) and strain (<b>displacement)</b> <b>control.</b> In strain control, the probe is {{displaced}} and the resulting stress of the sample is measured by implementing a force balance transducer, which utilizes different shafts. The advantages of strain control include a better short time response for materials of low viscosity and experiments of stress relaxation are done with relative ease. In stress control, a set {{force is applied to}} the same and several other experimental conditions (temperature, frequency, or time) can be varied. Stress control is typically less expensive than strain control because only one shaft is needed, but this also makes it harder to use. Some advantages of stress control include the fact that the structure of the sample is less likely to be destroyed and longer relaxation times/ longer creep studies can be done with much more ease. Characterizing low viscous materials come at a disadvantage of short time responses that are limited by inertia. Stress and strain control analyzers give about the same results as long as characterization is within the linear region of the polymer in question. However, stress control lends a more realistic response because polymers have a tendency to resist a load.|$|E

30|$|The {{repaired}} columns {{were tested}} {{under the same}} initial combined loading effects as the original columns. Similar to the procedure used for testing the original columns, the testing procedure for repaired columns was initiated in force control and then continued in <b>displacement</b> <b>control.</b> In testing the original columns, testing shifted to <b>displacement</b> <b>control</b> when first yield of the reinforcing steel occurred (Prakash et al. 2012). For the repaired columns, yielding of the steel had occurred during the previous test, and monitoring the strain was not always possible due to damage to the strain gages mounted to the steel reinforcement. Therefore, testing was shifted to <b>displacement</b> <b>control</b> when significant reduction of the stiffness was observed. In addition, different procedures were used to maintain the torque-to-moment ratio (T/M) during the <b>displacement</b> <b>control</b> testing. In the original tests, an iterative feedback system was used to control the torque-to-moment ratio (Prakash et al. 2012), whereas in the present program, a trial-and-error method was used based on values recorded from the previous cycles. As a result, some differences existed in the loading protocol details.|$|E

30|$|The two {{hydraulic}} actuators were precisely controlled in force or displacement modes by a servo-controlled system. Actuators B and C were initially used to apply shear {{force on the}} beam in force control mode {{at a rate of}} 22 kN/min (5 kips/min). During a test, the shear load–displacement curve for a beam was continuously monitored visually on a display screen. When the slope of this load–displacement curve started to decreasing (flatten-out), the control mode of the actuators was switched to <b>displacement</b> <b>control</b> with a rate of 5  mm/h (0.2 in./h).

40|$|A {{flexural}} {{model of}} four-point bending fatigue {{that has been}} experimentally validated for human cortical bone under load control {{was used to determine}} how load and <b>displacement</b> <b>control</b> testing affects the fatigue behavior of human cortical bone in three-point and symmetric four-point bending. Under load control, it was predicted that three-point bending produced no significant differences in fatigue life when compared to four-point bending. However, three-point bending produced less stiffness loss with increasing cycles than four-point bending. In four-point bending, <b>displacement</b> <b>control</b> was predicted to produce about one and a half orders of magnitude greater fatigue life when compared to load control. This prediction agrees with experimental observations of equine cannon bone tested in load and <b>displacement</b> <b>control</b> (Gibson et al., 1998). Displacement controlled three-point bending was found to produce approximately a 25 % greater fatigue life when compared to load control. The prediction of longer fatigue life under <b>displacement</b> <b>control</b> may have clinical relevance for the repair of damaged bone. The model can also be adapted to other geometric configurations, including modeling of whole long bones, and with appropriate fatigue data, other cortical bone types...|$|E

While researches in the industry are mainly focused on saving energy, it is actually brought to attention that energy savings and improved comfort can be realized together. A skid-steer loader that does not have a suspension can use its working hydraulic cylinders to achieve improved operator comfort and still achieve energy savings by using <b>displacement</b> <b>controlled</b> circuit. ^ The presented work uses <b>displacement</b> <b>controlled</b> skid-steer loader to achieve active vibration damping based on skyhook damping theory.

The proposed method of active damping shows improvement in comfort rating compared not only to the base machine but also to other available damping strategies. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a thorough analysis of potential-based and non-potential-based cohesive zone models (CZMs) {{under conditions of}} mixed-mode separation and mixedmode over-closure. Problems are identified with the well established potential-based Xu Needleman (XN) model {{and a number of}} new potential-based and non-potential-based models are proposed. It is demonstrated that derivation of traction separation relationships from a potential function can result in non-physical repulsive normal tractions and instantaneous negative incremental energy dissipation under <b>displacement</b> <b>controlled</b> monotonic mixed-mode separation when the work of tangential separation exceeds the work of normal separation. A modified potential-based (MP) model is proposed so that the zone in which repulsive normal tractions occur can be controlled. The MP model also provides an additional benefit of correct penalisation of mixed-mode over-closure, in contrast to the XN model. In order to fully eliminate the problem of repulsive normal tractions a non-potential-based CZM (NP 1) is also proposed. This model is shown to provide physically realistic behaviour under conditions of <b>displacement</b> <b>controlled</b> mixedmode separation and over-closure. Noting that the form of the traction separation equations differ for mode I and mode II separation for the XN, MP and NP 1 models, an additional non-potential-based model (NP 2) is proposed so that near mode-independent behaviour can be achieved in <b>displacement</b> <b>controlled</b> separation, while correctly penalising over-closure. Following from the NP 2 model, a non-potential-based model in which coupling is based on the separation magnitude is considered (SMC model). In the final part of the paper the performance of each model under traction controlled mixed-mode separation is investigated by numerically inverting the traction separation equations. Separation paths for the XN model reveal a strong bias toward mode I separation while the NP 1 model exhibits a bias towards mode II separation. Interestingly, the NP 2 model exhibits a high degree of mode sensitivity under traction controlled conditions, in contrast to its near mode independence under <b>displacement</b> <b>controlled</b> conditions. It is demonstrated that incorrect weighting of the coupling terms in non-potential models can lead to the existence of a singularity under traction controlled conditions. Finally, it is demonstrated that the potential-based models fail to capture a gradual change from mode II to mode I work of separation, as reported experimentally for traction controlled interface separation. In a follow-on Part II companion paper a number of case studies are simulated, demonstrating that the theoretical findings of the present paper have significant implications for the finite element prediction of interface debonding...|$|R

40|$|In {{the sector}} of mobile hydraulics, valve {{controlled}} systems are predominant. In these systems the load force and speed are adjusted by control valves. In machines where multiple drives {{are used in}} parallel at extremely varying loads the energy efficiency of such systems is often compromised over large working regions. Most valve controlled systems also lack the possibility to recuperate potential energy. A different category of hydraulic systems, called <b>displacement</b> <b>controlled</b> hydraulics {{are based on the}} manipulation of the hydraulic flow using the relative displacement of the hydraulic machines as the final control element. This type of hydrostatic power transfer, yields a resistance free velocity control, ideally leading to lossless load actuation. This thesis concerns the introduction of a new type of <b>displacement</b> <b>controlled</b> hydraulic system, adapted for construction machinery. The system decouples the hydraulic functions using one dedicated hydraulic machine for each drive. These machines are of open circuit type, capable of over center operation which enables energy recuperation. The system also comprises four separate valves that by means of switching allow the cylinder to be controlled over all four load quadrants. Depending on the selected valve hardware, the system may also include features available in a conventional valve controlled system, such as meter-out flow control. The system supports both symmetrical and asymmetrical cylinders. However, using the asymmetrical type the load may be controlled in two distinct states of operation. This yields an increased region of operation, which is otherwise generally stated as a drawback in <b>displacement</b> <b>controlled</b> systems. It also allows the selection between different control modes, where one of the modes is always more efficient than another. In this research both theoretical studies and a practical implementation demonstrate the energy related benefits of the new concept. The target application of this study is a medium-size wheel loader. Measurement results using the wheel loader in a short truck loading cycle show a 10 % percent reduction in fuel consumption. According to the theoretical investigation, this corresponds to a 20 % reduction in energy consumption for the hydraulicsystem itself...|$|R
