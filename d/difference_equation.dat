It uses a solitary-wave like approach to produce a stable solution with no numerical spreading. VC can capture the small-scale features to within as few as 2 grid cells. Within these features, a nonlinear <b>difference</b> <b>equation</b> is solved {{as opposed to the}} finite <b>difference</b> <b>equation.</b> VC is similar to shock capturing methods, where conservation laws are satisfied, so that the essential integral quantities are accurately computed.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 58) This paper {{presents an}} elemetry study of <b>difference</b> <b>equations.</b> <b>Difference</b> <b>equations</b> are defined and their {{origin in the}} works of Brook Taylor and James Stirling, circa 1715, is viewed in the perspective of broad developments of mathematics to that time. Methods of solving various types of <b>difference</b> <b>equations</b> are presented. These include linear <b>difference</b> <b>equations</b> with constant coefficients and with variable coefficients. <b>Difference</b> <b>equations</b> are applied to problems in areas where work is done in discrete intervals. Discussion centers on examples of their application in sequences of numbers, systems of <b>difference</b> <b>equations</b> (pythagorean triples), finding the zeros of certain polynomials, biological-population dynamics and in numerical approximation of <b>difference</b> <b>equations...</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1785, Laplace {{took the}} key forward step in using {{integrals}} {{of this form}} to transform a whole <b>difference</b> <b>equation,</b> rather than simply as a form for the solution, {{and found that the}} transformed equation was easier to solve than the original.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} {{differential}} equations {{is closely related}} to the theory of difference equations, in which the coordinates assume only discrete values, and the relationship involves values of the unknown function or functions and values at nearby coordinates. Many methods to compute numerical solutions of differential equations or study the properties of differential equations involve approximation of the solution of a differential equation by the solution of a corresponding <b>difference</b> <b>equation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bifurcation {{theory is}} used to {{illustrate}} how small changes in parameter values can give rise to dramatically different long run outcomes, a mathematical fact {{that may be used}} to explain drastic ecological differences that come about in qualitatively very similar systems. Logistic maps are polynomial mappings, and are often cited as providing archetypal examples of how chaotic behaviour can arise from very simple non-linear dynamical equations. The maps were popularized in a seminal 1976 paper by the theoretical ecologist Robert May. The <b>difference</b> <b>equation</b> is intended to capture the two effects of reproduction and starvation.|$|E
30|$|Research in <b>difference</b> <b>equations</b> {{has been}} active in recent years and has played an {{important}} role in numeral fields, including biology, computing, electrical circuit analysis, etc. (see [12 – 14]). There also has been a large number of studies on the extension of <b>difference</b> <b>equations</b> to time-delay systems in the literature [15 – 24]. Among these extensions, Zhu et al. [23] studied impulsive delay <b>difference</b> <b>equations</b> and gave the results of global exponential stability, and Li and Song [17] studied the asymptotic behavior of impulsive delay <b>difference</b> <b>equations.</b> However, there are not many related results for impulsive <b>difference</b> <b>equations</b> and impulsive delay <b>difference</b> <b>equations.</b> Based on the above observation, in this paper, periodic boundary value problems for impulsive <b>difference</b> <b>equations</b> with time delay are considered.|$|R
30|$|The journal Advances in <b>Difference</b> <b>Equations</b> is a peer-reviewed journal. The aim of Advances in <b>Difference</b> <b>Equations</b> is {{to report}} new {{developments}} in the field of <b>difference</b> <b>equations,</b> abstract, functional and fractional differential equations, and their applications in all fields. Advances in <b>Difference</b> <b>Equations</b> will accept high-quality papers containing original research results and survey articles of exceptional merit.|$|R
30|$|Partial <b>difference</b> <b>equations</b> are <b>difference</b> <b>equations</b> {{that involve}} {{functions}} {{with two or}} more independent integer variables. Such equations arise from considerations of random walk problems, molecular structure problems, and numerical difference approximation problems. Recently, {{there have been a}} large number of papers devoted to partial <b>difference</b> <b>equations,</b> and the problem of oscillatory of solutions and frequent oscillatory solutions for partial <b>difference</b> <b>equations</b> is receiving much attention.|$|R
25|$|The {{method of}} {{estimating}} {{the ratio of the}} number of favourable cases to the whole number of possible cases had been previously indicated by Laplace in a paper written in 1779. It consists of treating the successive values of any function as the coefficients in the expansion of another function, with reference to a different variable. The latter is therefore called the probability-generating function of the former. Laplace then shows how, by means of interpolation, these coefficients may be determined from the generating function. Next he attacks the converse problem, and from the coefficients he finds the generating function; this is effected by the solution of a finite <b>difference</b> <b>equation.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{function}} defined on {{an interval}} of the integers is usually called a sequence. A sequence {{could be a}} finite sequence from a data source or an infinite sequence from a discrete dynamical system. Such a discrete function could be defined explicitly by a list (if its domain is finite), or by a formula for its general term, {{or it could be}} given implicitly by a recurrence relation or <b>difference</b> <b>equation.</b> Difference equations are similar to a differential equations, but replace differentiation by taking the difference between adjacent terms; they can be used to approximate differential equations or (more often) studied in their own right. Many questions and methods concerning differential equations have counterparts for difference equations. For instance, where there are integral transforms in harmonic analysis for studying continuous functions or analogue signals, there are discrete transforms for discrete functions or digital signals. As well as the discrete metric there are more general discrete or finite metric spaces and finite topological spaces.|$|E
25|$|In 1798, {{he entered}} the École Polytechnique in Paris as first in his year, and {{immediately}} began to attract the notice of the professors of the school, who left him free {{to make his own}} decisions as to what he would study. In 1800, less than two years after his entry, he published two memoirs, one on Étienne Bézout's method of elimination, the other on the number of integrals of a finite <b>difference</b> <b>equation.</b> The latter was examined by Sylvestre-François Lacroix and Adrien-Marie Legendre, who recommended that it should be published in the Recueil des savants étrangers, an unprecedented honour for a youth of eighteen. This success at once procured entry for Poisson into scientific circles. Joseph Louis Lagrange, whose lectures on the theory of functions he attended at the École Polytechnique, recognized his talent early on, and became his friend (the Mathematics Genealogy Project lists Lagrange as his advisor, but this may be an approximation); while Pierre-Simon Laplace, in whose footsteps Poisson followed, regarded him almost as his son. The rest of his career, till his death in Sceaux near Paris, was nearly occupied by the composition and publication of his many works and in fulfilling the duties of the numerous educational positions to which he was successively appointed.|$|E
30|$|The {{study of}} {{rational}} <b>difference</b> <b>equations</b> of order greater than one is quite challenging and rewarding because some prototypes {{for the development}} of the basic theory of the global behavior of nonlinear <b>difference</b> <b>equations</b> of order greater than one come from the results for rational <b>difference</b> <b>equations.</b> However, there have not been any effective general methods to deal with the global behavior of rational <b>difference</b> <b>equations</b> of order greater than one so far. Therefore, the study of rational <b>difference</b> <b>equations</b> of order greater than one is worth further consideration.|$|R
30|$|There {{is a vast}} {{literature}} about the periodic solutions of <b>difference</b> <b>equations</b> and we mention here only few works.

Reference [2] gives an overview of the results on the existence of periodic solutions of <b>difference</b> <b>equations</b> that have been obtained in the last two decades. It covers both ordinary and Volterra difference systems. Reference [3] is devoted to the periodicity for nonlinear <b>difference</b> <b>equations.</b> In [4, 5] the authors study linear <b>difference</b> <b>equations</b> perturbed by Volterra terms.
