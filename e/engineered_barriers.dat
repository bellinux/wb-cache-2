40|$|Long-term {{stability}} of emplacement drifts and potential near-field fluid flow resulting from coupled effects {{are among the}} concerns for safe disposal of high-level nuclear waste (HLW). A number of factors can induce drift instability or change the near-field flow patterns. Repetitive seismic loads from earthquakes and thermal loads generated by the decay of emplaced waste are two significant factors. One of two key technical uncertainties (KTU) that can potentially pose {{a high risk of}} noncompliance with the performance objectives of 10 CFR Part 60 is the prediction of thermal-mechanical (including repetitive seismic load) effects on {{stability of}} emplacement drifts and the <b>engineered</b> <b>barrier</b> system. The second KTU of concern is the prediction of thermal-mechanical-hydrological (including repetitive seismic load) effects on the host rock surrounding the <b>engineered</b> <b>barrier</b> system. The Rock Mechanics research project being conducted at the Center for Nuclear Waste Regulatory Analyses (CNWRA) is intended to address certain specific technical issues associated with these two KTUs. This research project has two major components: (i) seismic response of rock joints and a jointed rock mass and (ii) coupled thermal-mechanical-hydrological (TMH) response of a jointed rock mass surrounding the <b>engineered</b> <b>barrier</b> system (EBS).

50|$|The {{search for}} a {{suitable}} site for a deep geological repository commenced shortly after the commissioning of the first nuclear units at the Dukovany nuclear power plant, i.e. in the 1980s. In the 1990s the first study was conducted aimed at evaluating {{the potential of the}} geological conditions of the whole of the Czech Republic. At that time international research and experimentation began aimed at identifying the most appropriate materials and methods with concern to the construction of both the repository itself and the <b>engineered</b> <b>barriers.</b> Thanks to the multi-barrier system (a system of complementary natural and man-made barriers that completely prevents, or at least minimises, the escape of radionuclides for a period {{of hundreds of thousands of}} years), deep repositories represent the safest way in which to dispose of high-level radioactive waste.|$|E
50|$|The spent {{nuclear fuel}} from {{uranium-235}} and plutonium-239 nuclear fission contains {{a wide variety of}} carcinogenic radionuclide isotopes such as strontium-90, iodine-131 and caesium-137, and includes some of the most long-lived transuranic elements such as americium-241 and isotopes of plutonium. The most long-lived radioactive wastes, including {{spent nuclear fuel}}, are usually managed to be contained and isolated from the environment {{for a long period of}} time. Spent nuclear fuel storage is mostly a problem in the United States, following a 1977 President Jimmy Carter prohibition to nuclear fuel recycling. France, Great Britain and Japan, are some of the countries which rejected the repository solution. Spent nuclear fuel is a valuable asset, not simply waste.Disposal of these wastes in engineered facilities, or repositories, located deep underground in suitable geologic formations is seen as the reference solution. The International Panel on Fissile Materials has said:It is widely accepted that spent nuclear fuel and high-level reprocessing and plutonium wastes require well-designed storage for long periods of time, to minimize releases of the contained radioactivity into the environment. Safeguards are also required to ensure that neither plutonium nor highly enriched uranium is diverted to weapon use. There is general agreement that placing spent nuclear fuel in repositories hundreds of meters below the surface would be safer than indefinite storage of spent fuel on the surface. Common elements of repositories include the radioactive waste, the containers enclosing the waste, other <b>engineered</b> <b>barriers</b> or seals around the containers, the tunnels housing the containers, and the geologic makeup of the surrounding area.|$|E

40|$|Swelling clays play a {{major role}} in current {{concepts}} for the underground disposal of high-level nuclear waste in deep geological formations. In one of the multi-barrier concepts for preventing the escape of radioactive substances from a high-level nuclear waste repository, the barrier consists of a copper container, compacted bentonite as buffer and backfill (the <b>engineered</b> <b>barrier),</b> and the repository host rock. Corrosion of the copper canister and radiolysis of water both produce hydrogen. When the buffer and backfill are saturated with water and the permeability of the bentonite is reduced by swelling, any hydrogen that is produced can accumulate in the space between the container and the <b>engineered</b> <b>barrier.</b> This will result in pressures exceeding the entry pressure of the bentonite and passage of gas through the <b>engineered</b> <b>barrier.</b> An experimental program was developed to investigate the thermal and hydraulic properties of the buffer and backfill under conditions expected to exist in a permanent repository for radioactive waste. Water retention curves were measured from low to high saturation using a pressure cell and a thermohygrometer. Non-isothermal drainage experiments were also designed. The measured water outflow, pressure and temperature values were used for inverse modeling using iTOUGH 2. The capillary pressure curves obtained with iTOUGH 2 were consistent with those obtained with the pressure cell and thermohygrometer.

40|$|International audienceReceived 14 April 2008 Received in {{revised form}} 24 July 2008 Accepted 26 July 2008 Available online 9 August 2008 Keywords: Clay Defect Irradiation Nuclear waste <b>Engineered</b> <b>barrier</b> The {{influence}} of radiation on clay mineral properties remains relatively poorly documented, despite its {{importance for the}} safety assessment of high level nuclear waste repositories (HLNWR) where clays are components of the <b>engineered</b> <b>barrier</b> or the host rock in many countries. Various radiation-induced point defects have been observed in kaolinite, dickite, montmorillonite and illite. In kaolinite, the defects stable at the scale of geological periods {{have been used for}} geochemical applications or dating. Nevertheless, the potential influence of point defects on clay properties has not been demonstrated. Ballistic effects of heavy ions (alpha recoil nuclei) are able to amorphize the structure of clay minerals, as it was shown for smectite either irradiated with ion beam or doped with alpha emitters, leading to consistent amorphization doses. Several estimations show that amorphization of smectite from the <b>engineered</b> <b>barrier</b> would occur after 1000 years of exposure arising from waste leakage. Besides, amorphization by ionizing radiation in a HLNWR is unlikely because required dose is unrealistically too high. Consequences of amorphization on physico-chemical properties such as swelling, CEC, solubility are potentially very important but have not been described for clay minerals. Ionizing radiations can reduce structural Fe 3 + in montmorillonite and may thus potentially modify its layer charge and CEC. The influence of irradiation on physico-chemical properties such as CEC is revealed only at high irradiation doses, larger than several MGy, and remains relatively limited. Nevertheless, contradictory results still exist about the effect of irradiation on redox and surface reactivity. These parameters together with their consequences on properties, obtained on model specimen used in laboratory or test experiments, must be considered in the performance assessment of the <b>engineered</b> <b>barrier</b> of a nuclear waste disposal. This paper reviews the various aspects of irradiation effects on clay minerals with emphasis on physico- chemical properties, after a presentation of the methodology of experimental irradiation...|$|R
