We have investigated this issue by combining an intranasal Mycobacterium bovis–Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) infection with a murine model of allergen, (ovalbumin [OVA]) induced airway eosinophilia. BCG infection either 4 or 12 wk before allergen airway challenge resulted in a 90 – 95 and 60 – 70 % reduction in eosinophilia within the lungs, respectively, compared to uninfected controls. The inhibition of airway eosinophilia correlated with a reduced level of IL- 5 production by T cells from the lymph node draining the site of OVA challenge. Interestingly, BCG infection of the lung had no effect on IgG 1 and IgE OVA-specific serum immunoglobulin or blood eosinophil levels. Furthermore, BCG-induced inhibition of airway eosinophilia was strongly reduced in interferon (IFN) - � receptor–deficient mice and could be partially reversed by <b>intranasal</b> IL- 5 <b>application.</b> <b>Intranasal</b> BCG infections could also reduce the degree of lung eosinophilia and IL- 5 produced by T cells after Nippostrongylus brasiliensis infection.

The effect of insulin on hippocampus-dependent brain activation was explored using a double-blind and placebo-controlled design. Following intranasal administration of either insulin (40 IU) or placebo, 16 male subjects participated in two experimental MRI sessions with olfactory and visual mazes. Each maze included two separate runs. The first was an encoding maze during which subjects learned eight olfactory or eight visual cues at different target locations.

NPY evoked a dose-dependent reduction of nasal airway resistance (NAR) on the ipsilateral side. Maximal decrease was � 24. 0 � 10. 0 % at 12 nmol, p � 0. 05 (n � 9). There was a decrease in nasal NO production on the ipsilateral side after application of NPY 12 nmol (� 7. 4 � 1. 2 %, p � 0. 05, n � 8).

40|$|Posttraumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) is {{a mental health}} disorder triggered by experiencing a traumatic event. PTSD causes recurrent flashbacks of traumatic memories that lead to over-consolidation. Memory over-consolidation prevents extinction of emotional and physiological responses to the memory. Because individuals can respond differently to stress and frightening experiences, no measures are currently practiced to prevent PTSD. By studying {{the changes in the}} brain during PTSD and after stress, it can be hypothesized that treatments that regulated HPA axis activity may prevent PTSD symptoms if applied soon after stress. Risk of developing PTSD is associated with abnormal cortisol and norepinephrine levels and altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning after trauma. New research on how stress alters the HPA axis over time has opened up the opportunity to prevent PTSD in high-risk patients. Oxytocin has been shown to regulate the HPA axis by inhibiting amygdala activity and the fear response. Oxytocin may also reduce stress by increasing the benefit individuals receive from social support. After reviewing previous studies on oxytocin, PTSD, and the HPA axis, it was concluded that regulation of the HPA axis by oxytocin could prevent PTSD by inhibiting memory over-consolidation and by reducing physical damage to the brain caused by abnormal cortisol and norepinephrine levels. This neurotransmitter is suitable for pharmacological studies because oxytocin can reach the central nervous system safely and effectively through <b>intranasal</b> spray <b>application</b> with minimal side effects. Intranasal oxytocin’s anxiolytic qualities and ability to alter HPA axis function call for more research to evaluate its potential pharmacological applications.

BALB/c mice received TDI or vehicle (acetone/olive oil) on each ear on three consecutive days (days 1, 2, and 3; 0. 3 or 3 % TDI) or only once (day 1, 1 % TDI).

The main outcome measures were the state of nasal, skin and pharyngeal S. aureus carriage state, the incidence of peritonitis, and mal-function-free PD catheter survival. After 3 months of CAPD initiation, S. aureus carrier state was detected in 11 (33. 3 &#x 0025;) patients in group (1), and in 2 (6. 25 &#x 0025;) patients in group (2) (p< 0. 005), and at the end of the study 10 (30. 3 &#x 0025;) patients from group (1) and none in group (2) remained S. aureus carriers (p< 0. 001).

Experimental studies in animals, as well as case reports in humans, suggest that OT affects different aspects of sexual behaviour and has predominantly facilitating properties for sexual appetence and performance. Using a previously established experimental paradigm of sexual arousal and masturbation-induced orgasm, this study investigated the acute effects of <b>intranasal</b> OT <b>application</b> (24 I. U.) on endocrine parameters and measures of sexual appetence and function in healthy men (n= 10). In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced cross-over design, sexual arousal, and orgasm were induced by an erotic film and masturbation. In addition to the continuous recording of endocrine (OT, cortisol, prolactin, epinephrine, norepinephrine) and cardiovascular data (heart rate), parameters of appetitive, consummatory, and refractory sexual behaviour were assessed using the acute sexual experience scale (ASES). OT plasma levels were significantly elevated after intranasal OT throughout the whole experiment (> 60 min). In addition, OT treatment induced significantly higher increases in epinephrine plasma levels during sexual activity without affecting cortisol levels, prolactin levels or heart rate. OT treatment did not alter appetitive, consummatory, and refractory sexual behaviour according to the ASES. However, when subjects were asked about their subjective perception of whether OT or placebo had been applied, eight out of 10 subjects in the OT group answered correctly, thus pointing to an altered perception of arousal. In conclusion, intranasally administered OT leads to a marked increase in OT plasma levels together with increased secretion of catecholamines when subjects are engaged in sexual activity in a laboratory setting. As the effects of OT on sexual behaviour were equivocal, future studies should examine possible facilitating effects further by including males, females, and couples in a field setting, taking into account that OT exerts the most prominent behavioural effects in pair bond formations...|$|R

Furthermore, daily PAC 1 -receptor activation via PACAP resulted in an increased mRNA level of both the PAC 1 receptor and its ligand PACAP. Our behavioral studies showed that long-term PACAP treatment of APP[V 717 I]-transgenic mice improved cognitive function in animals. Thus, nasal application of PACAP was effective, and our results indicate that PACAP could be of therapeutic value in treating AD. -Rat, D., Schmitt, U., Tippmann, F., Dewachter, I., Theunis, C., Wieczerzak, E, Postina, R., van Leuven, F., Fahrenholz, F., Kojro, E.

Current medical treatment for acute at-tacks includes the use of oxygen inhalation, subcutaneous or <b>intranasal</b> <b>application</b> of triptans, or intranasal lidocaine [1 – 3]. Preventative medications usually consist of verapamil or lithium as first choice; alternatively or concurrently, steroids, topiramate, melatonin, long-acting triptans, and occipital nerve blocks are also commonly used as prophy-lactic treatments [4 – 6]. The costs of such pharmaceutical treatments for cCH are substantial, and have previously been estimated to average € 15, 700 per year, with severely afflicted patients incurring even higher annual medication costs [7]. Electrical stimulation of the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) has recently been proposed as an alternative treat-ment approach for cluster headache, relying on an im...|$|E
40|$|Mucosal {{vaccination}} via {{the respiratory}} tract can elicit protective immunity in animal infection models, but {{the underlying mechanisms}} are still poorly understood. We show that a single <b>intranasal</b> <b>application</b> of the replication-deficient modified vaccinia virus Ankara, which is widely used as a recombinant vaccination vector, results in prominent induction of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT). Although initial peribronchiolar infiltrations, characterized {{by the presence of}} dendritic cells (DCs) and few lymphocytes, can be found 4 d after virus application, organized lymphoid structures with segregated B and T cell zones are first observed at day 8. After intratracheal application, in vitro–differentiated, antigen-loaded DCs rapidly migrate into preformed BALT and efficiently activate antigen-specific T cells, as revealed by two-photon microscopy. Furthermore, the lung-specific depletion of DCs in mice that express the diphtheria toxin receptor {{under the control of the}} CD 11 c promoter interferes with BALT maintenance. Collectively, these data identify BALT as tertiary lymphoid structures supporting the efficient priming of T cell responses directed against unrelated airborne antigens while crucially requiring DCs for its sustained presence...|$|E
40|$|Influenza {{virus is}} one of the most {{prevalent}} and ancient infections in humans. About a fifth of world’s population is infected by influenza virus annually, leading to high morbidity and mortality, particularly in infants, the elderly and the immunocompromised. In the US alone, influenza outbreaks lead to roughly 30, 000 deaths each year. Current vaccines and anti-influenza drugs are of limited use due to high mutation rate of the virus and side effects. In recent years, RNA interference, triggered by synthetic short interfering RNA (siRNA), has rapidly evolved as a potent antiviral regimen. Properly designed siRNAs have been shown to function as potent inhibitors of influenza virus replication. The siRNAs outperform traditional small molecule antivirals in a number of areas, such as ease of design, modest cost, and fast turnaround. Although specificity and tissue delivery remain major bottlenecks in the clinical applications of RNAi in general, <b>intranasal</b> <b>application</b> of siRNA against respiratory viruses including, but not limited to influenza virus, has experienced significant success and optimism, which is reviewed here...|$|E
40|$|Secretin and its receptors show wide {{distribution}} in the central nervous system. It was demonstrated previously that intravenous (i. v.) and intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) application of secretin influenced the behavior of rat, mouse, and human. In our previous experiment, we used a special animal model, Japanese waltzing mice (JWM). These animals run around without stopping (the ambulation distance is very limited) {{and they do not}} bother with their environment. The i. c. v. secretin attenuated this hyperactive repetitive movement. In the present work, the effect of i. c. v. and <b>intranasal</b> (i. n.) <b>application</b> of secretin was compared. We have also looked for the presence of secretin receptors in the brain structures related to motor functions. Two micrograms of i. c. v. secretin improved the horizontal movement of JWM, enhancing the ambulation distance. It was nearly threefold higher in treated than in control animals. The i. n. application of secretin to the left nostril once or twice a day or once for 3 days more effectively enhanced the ambulation distance than i. c. v. administration. When secretin was given twice a day for 3 days it had no effect. Secretin did not improve the explorative behavior (the rearing), of JWM. With the use of in situ hybridization, we have found very dense secretin receptor labeling in the cerebellum. In the primary motor cortex and in the striatum, only a few labeled cells were seen. It was supposed that secretin exerted its effect through specific receptors, mainly present in the cerebellum...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrated}} {{earlier that}} an ongoing Th 2 polarized inflammation in the lung facilitates "collateral" inhalational priming to unrelated antigens. Using a mouse model of adoptive T cell transfer, we could {{show that a}} Th 1 {{as well as a}} Th 17 polarized lung inflammation also confers collateral priming. Since this phenomenon depends on the presence of IL- 17 in both cases, we analyzed the phenotype of the resulting lung inflammation after Th 17 mediated collateral priming and investigated the role of neutrophils in this context. Transgenic T cells from DO 11. 10 mice were polarized to-wards Th 17 in vitro and transferred into congenic wildtype mice. After <b>intranasal</b> (i. n.) <b>application</b> of the cognate antigen Ovalbumin (OVA) together with an unrelated antigen, intranasal challenges with either OVA or the unrelated antigen were performed. Neutrophils were depleted in vivo by repeated application of Ly 6 G-specific antibody (1 A 8). Lung inflammation was analyzed via assessment of serum antibodies, BAL differentiation, lung histology and analysis of the cytokine profile of mediastinal lymph node and lung cells by means of ELISA and intracellular cytokine staining. The impact of Th 17 mediated pulmonary inflammation on lung function was assessed by measuring pulmonary resistance (RL) after repetitive inhalational methacholine (MCh) challenge in orotracheally intubated anesthetized mice. Collateral priming towards unrelated antigens occurred in the context of Th 17 polarized lung inflammation, leading to a massive influx of lymphocytes into the lung. Lung function measurements showed that an ongoing Th 17 polarized pulmonary inflammation leads to a significant airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Depletion of neutrophils during T-cell transfer and primary challenge phase did not influence priming towards unrelated antigens in our model. These results demonstrate a pivotal role for IL- 17 producing T cells in conferring inhalational priming and mediating AHR, while indicating a minor role for neutrophils in the collateral priming phase...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nasal formulations containing midazolam (5 - 30 mg ml(- 1)) complexed with cyclodextrin.; An open-label sequential trial {{was conducted in}} eight healthy subjects receiving single doses of 1 mg and 3 mg intranasally and 1 mg midazolam intravenously. Pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained by non-compartmental and two-compartmental models. Pharmacodynamic effects of midazolam were assessed using VAS and a reaction time test.; Mean bioavailability of midazolam after nasal administration ranged from 76 +/- 12 % to 92 +/- 15 %. With formulations delivering 1 mg midazolam, mean C(max) values between 28. 1 +/- 9. 1 and 30. 1 +/- 6. 6 ng ml(- 1) were reached after 9. 4 +/- 3. 2 - 11. 3 +/- 4. 4 min. With formulations delivering 3 mg midazolam, mean C(max) values were between 68. 9 +/- 19. 8 and 80. 6 +/- 15. 2 ng ml(- 1) after 7. 2 +/- 0. 7 - 13. 0 +/- 4. 3 min. Chitosan significantly increased C(max) and reduced t(max) of midazolam in the high-dose formulation. Mean ratios of dose-adjusted AUC after <b>intranasal</b> and intravenous <b>application</b> for 1 '-hydroxymidazolam were between 0. 97 +/- 0. 15 and 1. 06 +/- 0. 24, excluding relevant gastrointestinal absorption of intranasal midazolam. The pharmacodynamic effects after the low-dose nasal formulations were comparable with those after 1 mg intravenous midazolam. The maximum increase in reaction time by the chitosan-containing formulation delivering 3 mg midazolam was greater compared with 1 mg midazolam i. v. (95 +/- 78 ms and 19 +/- 22 ms, mean difference 75. 5 ms, 95 % CI 15. 5, 135. 5, P > 0. 01). Intranasal midazolam was well tolerated but caused reversible irritation of the nasal mucosa.; Effective midazolam serum concentrations were reached within less than 10 min after nasal application of a highly concentrated midazolam formulation containing an equimolar amount of the solubilizer RMbetaCD combined with the absorption enhancer chitosan...|$|R
