50|$|One of the {{problems}} with the RNA world hypothesis is to discover the pathway by which RNA became upgraded to the <b>DNA</b> <b>system.</b> Geoffrey Diemer and Ken Stedman, at Portland State University in Oregon, may have found a solution. While conducting a survey of viruses in a hot acidic lake in Lassen Volcanic National Park, California, they uncovered evidence that a simple DNA virus had acquired a gene from a completely unrelated RNA-based virus. Virologist Luis Villareal of the University of California Irvine also suggests that viruses capable of converting an RNA-based gene into DNA and then incorporating it into a more complex DNA-based genome might have been common in the Virus world during the RNA to DNA transition some 4 billion years ago. This finding bolsters the argument for the transfer of information from the RNA world to the emerging DNA world before the emergence of the Last Universal Common Ancestor. From the research, the diversity of this virus world is still with us.|$|E
5000|$|The {{introduction}} of Microsoft at the desktop and server layers {{resulted in the}} development of technologies such as OLE for process control (OPC), which is now a de facto industry connectivity standard. Internet technology also began to make its mark in automation and the DCS world, with most DCS HMI supporting Internet connectivity. The 1990s were also known for the [...] "Fieldbus Wars", where rival organizations competed to define what would become the IEC fieldbus standard for digital communication with field instrumentation instead of 4-20 milliamp analog communications. The first fieldbus installations occurred in the 1990s. Towards the end of the decade, the technology began to develop significant momentum, with the market consolidated around Ethernet I/P, Foundation Fieldbus and Profibus PA for process automation applications. Some suppliers built new systems from the ground up to maximize functionality with fieldbus, such as Rockwell PlantPAX System, Honeywell with Experion & Plantscape SCADA systems, ABB with System 800xA, Emerson Process Management with the Emerson Process Management DeltaV control system, Siemens with the SPPA-T3000 or Simatic PCS 7, Forbes Marshall with the Microcon+ control system and Azbil Corporation with the Harmonas-DEO system. Fieldbus technics have been used to integrate machine, drives, quality and condition monitoring applications to one DCS with Valmet <b>DNA</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

However, the configuration transitions of DNA molecules induced {{by the presence of}} nicks have not been quantitatively investigated. This study aims to analyze the configuration transitions of free circular <b>DNA</b> <b>system</b> induced by nicks. Using atomic force microscopy, two configuration states were observed in the free circular <b>DNA</b> <b>system</b> with different nick numbers. To understand the transmission of torsional energy among DNA base pairs, we defined the effective length and nicking angle.

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} (MD) {{simulations of}} a double-stranded DNA with explicit water and small ions were {{performed with the}} zero-dipole summation (ZD) method, which was recently developed {{as one of the}} non-Ewald methods. Double-stranded DNA is highly charged and polar, with phosphate groups in its backbone and their counterions, and thus precise treatment for the long-range electrostatic interactions is always required to maintain the stable and native double-stranded form. A simple truncation method deforms it profoundly. On the contrary, the ZD method, which considers the neutralities of charges and dipoles in a truncated subset, well reproduced the electrostatic energies of the <b>DNA</b> <b>system</b> calculated by the Ewald method. The MD simulations using the ZD method provided a stable <b>DNA</b> <b>system,</b> with similar structures and dynamic properties to those produced by the conventional Particle mesh Ewald method...|$|E

40|$|Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a {{debilitating}} malignant brain tumor with expected patient survival {{of less than}} a year and limited responsiveness to most treatments, often requiring biopsy for diagnosis and invasive surgery for treatment. We propose a DNA computer system, consisting of input, computation, and output components, for diagnosis and treatment. The input component will detect the presence of three GBM biomarkers: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), caveolin- 1 Î± (CAV), and B 2 receptors. The computation component will include indicator segments for each of these genes, and ensure that output is only released if all the biomarkers are present. The output component will consist of the therapeutic agent interleukin- 12 (IL- 12). This study will designate four groups of animals: untreated tumor-free (control), tumor-inoculated (RG 2), treated and tumor-free (DNA), and treated and tumor-inoculated (RG 2 /DNA). In the RG 2 and RG 2 /DNA groups, we will inoculate adult male Fischer rats with RG 2 cells into the striatum to induce tumor growth. Rats in the DNA and RG 2 /DNA groups will be implanted with the <b>DNA</b> <b>system</b> at the same location via recombinant adeno- associated viral vectors. The effectiveness of the <b>DNA</b> <b>system</b> will be evaluated through tumor size measurements, collected from brain slices stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and survival curve. Additionally, IL- 12 localization will confirm the release of the output component. We anticipate that the DNA treatment will result in a decrease in tumor size, leading to smaller tumor size in the RG 2 /DNA group versus the RG 2 group. The control group is expected to survive the longest, followed by the DNA group, then the RG 2 /DNA group, and finally the RG 2 group. In the DNA group, IL- 12 is expected to stay localized to the implantation site, remaining in its unreleased stem-loop form. On the other hand, it is expected to be released and active in the RG 2 /DNA group. This study provides a proof of concept to demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of a <b>DNA</b> <b>system</b> using VEGF, CAV, and B 2 receptors as biomarkers and IL- 12 as a therapeutic output component in the RG 2 model. Further research may include varying several of the parameters used in this study, including amount of RG 2 administered, choice of biomarkers, quantity and choice of output component, and choice of animal model. This system provides a promising and innovative new approach that is less invasive than surgery yet is still effective in diagnosing, targeting, and treating GBM...|$|E
