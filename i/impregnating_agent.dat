The pretreatment was assessed in terms of glucose and xylose yields after enzymatic hydrolysis and inhibitor formation (furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural) in the pretreatment. Results from pretreatment using SO 2 as <b>impregnating</b> <b>agent</b> was used as reference. Results For sugar cane bagasse, the highest glucose yield (86. 6 % of theoretical) was obtained after pretreatment at 205 °C for 15 min. For sugar cane leaves the highest glucose yield (97. 2 % of theoretical) was obtained after pretreatment at 220 °C for 5 min. The reference pretreatment, using impregnation with SO 2 and performed at 190 °C for 5 min, resulted in an overall glucose yield of 79. 7 % and 91. 9 % for bagasse and leaves, respectively. Conclusions Comparable pretreatment performance was obtained with CO 2 as compared to when SO 2 is used, although higher temperature and pressure were needed.

Results SEM and TEM data showed that the structural modifications undergone by the pretreatment with CO 2 were less pronounced in comparison to that using SO 2, which can be directly related to the combined severity of each pretreatment. According to XRD data, untreated bagasse showed, as expected, a lower crystallinity index (CI = 48. 0 %) when compared to pretreated samples with SO 2 (CI = 65. 5 %) or CO 2 (CI = 56. 4 %), due to the hemicellulose removal of 68. 3 % and 40. 5 %, respectively. FTIR spectroscopy supported SEM, TEM and XRD results, revealing a more extensive action of SO 2. Conclusions The SEM, TEM, XRD and FTIR spectroscopy techniques used in this work contributed to structural and chemical analysis of the untreated and pretreated bagasse. The images from SEM and TEM can be related to the severity of SO 2 pretreatment, which is almost twice higher.

Calcium chloride {{has been used}} as activating vis-à-vis <b>impregnating</b> <b>agent</b> to dope calcium onto the surface of adsorbent to facilitate the binding of fluoride. RSM has been used to optimize calcium impregnation condition as well as for optimization of removal of fluoride. The adsorbent prepared at optimum condition is termed as calcium-impregnated carbonized sal flower petal (CCSFP). The wave number of 1253  cm− 1 corresponds to strong C–F bond indicating the adsorption of fluoride on the Ca-impregnated carbonized adsorbent. EDX studies of CCSFP and fluoride-loaded CCSFP prove the impregnation of Ca on SFP and sorption of fluoride onto CCSFP, respectively. Lower pH has been found to favor the adsorption process, and hence all the kinetic and equilibrium studies have been carried out at pH 3. Maximum adsorption capacity of CCSFP {{has been found to be}} 5.46  mg/g. When groundwater having fluoride concentration of 7.5  mg/L was treated with CCSFP at an optimum adsorbent dose of 2  g/L, pH 3.5, the final concentration of treated water was found to be 1.46  mg/L which is below the permissible limit.

40|$|To {{avoid the}} use of toxic {{building}} materials {{is one of the}} principles of sustainable construction. However and contrary to general beliefs, current residential buildings frequently contain many toxic building materials, some of which even comply with legal regulations. Part of the problem is because architects and civil engineers have no form of knowing the toxicity of building materials. The other part is economically related. Some regulations about toxicity limits are influenced by economic reasons. For instance, although scientific evidence about the toxicity of lead plumbing has existed for quite some time, legal regulations avoid imposing very tight thresholds because of the cost of lead pipe substitution (in Europe that could cost almost 200, 000 million euros). It is then no surprise to see that the related Directive (98 / 83 /CE) established a 15 -year delay period before the 10 mg/l lead content threshold is enforced.

40|$|Activated carbons are {{adsorbents}} {{that are}} industrially used in multiple processes for product separation and purification, {{and for the}} treatment of liquid and gaseous effluents. Despite its frequent use in the water and waste industries, activated carbons remain an expensive material. In view of the high cost and the tedious procedures for the preparation and regeneration of activated carbons, there is a continuing search for low-cost potential adsorbents. The preparation of activated carbons from lignin is an attractive way of giving added value to this material, which is mainly used as in-house fuel for the recovery of both energy and residual inorganic matter. Over the past few decades, some works have been done on the activation of agricultural lignocellulosic waste materials to carbons, due to their low cost and high availability. Nevertheless, there is not any literature report about the activated carbon production from brewer’s spent grain (BSG) lignin. Use of BSG lignin as starting material for activated carbon production is interesting because BSG (the main brewery by-product) is produced in large amounts during all year, and is a lignin-rich material. Lignin can be converted in activated carbon by physical or chemical activation, the last one being more amply used than physical activation, because it requires lower activation temperatures and gives higher product yields. The purpose of the present work was to prepare activated carbon from BSG lignin, by chemical activation using phosphoric acid as <b>impregnating</b> <b>agent,</b> and to examine the influence of preparation conditions (acid/lignin ratio and carbonization temperature) on the textural characteristics of the materials produced (surface area, volume of pores, and pores size distribution) as well as on its adsorption capacities. Chemical activation of BSG lignin using phosphoric acid as <b>impregnating</b> <b>agent</b> was performed at various acid/lignin ratios (1, 2, or 3 g/g) and carbonization temperatures (300, 450, or 600 ºC), according to a 22 full factorial design. The resulting materials were characterized (regarding the surface area, volume of pores, and pores size distribution), and used for detoxification of the BSG hemicellulosic hydrolysate, which consists in a mixture of sugars, phenolic compounds, metallic ions, among other compounds. BSG carbons presented BET surface areas between 33 and 692 m 2 /g, and volume of pores between 0. 058 and 0. 453 cm 3 /g, which generally consisted in micro and mesopores. Adsorption capacity also varied to each carbon, according to the used activation condition. However, all of them showed high capacity for adsorption of metallic ions, mainly nickel, iron, chromium and silicon. In most of the cases, the BSG carbons efficiency for removal of these metals was higher than that obtained when using a commercial carbon sample. Phenolic compounds concentration and color were also reduced by using these sorbents, and the sugars content was practically not affected, which is benefic if the hydrolysate use in bioconversion processes is desired. The present work allowed to conclude {{that it is possible to}} produce activated carbons with good efficiency for phenolic compounds and metallic ions removal (mainly Ni, Fe, Cr, and Si), by chemical activation of the BSG lignin. The adsorption capacity of the carbons compared well and even favorably with that of a commercial activated carbon, suggesting that they have potential to be successfully used in detoxification processes in substitution of commercial sorbents. Regarding to the preparation of these activated carbons, an impregnation ratio and activation temperature of 3 g H 3 PO 4 /g lignin and 600 ºC, respectively, was the best combination of operating conditions leading to activated carbons with good capacity for adsorption of different toxic compounds.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 The {{feasibility}} of impregnating {{two types of}} wood (pine, poplar) with two different preservatives (creosote, CCA) by means of supercritical carbon dioxide (sc-CO 2) as carrier was investigated {{in view of the}} actuality of treatment of wooden poles in electricity distribution networks and in the agricultural sector. Two important quantities were determined prior to performing impregnation runs. The impregnation capacity of the two types of wood was measured by estimating gravimetrically the amount of water and mercury porosimetrically the amount of mercury that can be taken up by the wood. The results were highly comparable and could be used to predict the amount of preservative that could potentially be impregnated. These figures Served as benchmark for efficient impregnation. The solubility of the preservatives in sc-CO 2 was measured by means of a supercritical extractor (Isco) in static mode as this quantity was expected {{to play an important role}} in the mechanism of impregnation. The impregnation of specially prepared wood samples was performed in a locally manufactured sample holder which fitted an existing supercritical extractor (Varian). The impregnation experiments on laboratory scale were extended to pilot plant scale by using a larger supercritical extractor (Swiss Nova). The wood samples could be impregnated only to a limited extent (creosote: 12 % m/m for poplar, 25 % m/m for pine; CCA: 7 % m/m for poplar, 19 % m/m for pine), since microscopic analysis revealed that neither of the two preservatives was capable of occupying the pores of the wood but bound to the wood vessels instead. The pressure dependence of the impregnation suggested that the process determining parameters were pressure and solubility for creosote impregnation and pressure only for CCA impregnation. This conclusion could be supported by surface response graphs. A break strength test was applied to all impregnated samples in order to confirm that the ultrastructure of the wood was not damaged by the high pressures involved. Impregnation was repeated with N 2 as carrier, and the results confirmed the superiority of sc-CO 2 as an <b>impregnating</b> <b>agent.</b> Master...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{activated}} carbons (ACs) were synthesized {{and tested}} as CO 2 sorbents. In-house ACs were prepared starting both {{from a traditional}} biomass (i. e. oak wood) and from an unconventional macroalgal seaweed (i. e. Laminaria hyperborea). In addition to this, a biomass-derived commercial AC was studied as a sorbent on which polyethylenimine (PEI) was impregnated. Biochars were produced both by pyrolysis at 800 °C and by hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) at 250 °C. Pyrolysis chars generally had higher fixed carbon and lower volatile content compared to hydrochars. Moreover, seaweed-derived chars exhibited significantly larger ash content than that measured for oak wood-based chars. Pyrolyzed and HTC-treated biomass were then activated either by physical (CO 2) or chemical (KOH) treatment. Limited texture development of the biochars was observed after CO 2 activation, yet this treatment {{proved to be more}} suitable for the creation of narrower micropores. By contrast, KOH activation, followed by HCl washing, led to a more dramatic texture enhancement (but to lower narrow micropore volumes) and higher purity of the ACs due to a significant demineralization of the chars. The morphology of all materials was examined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) which revealed the creation of larger pores after KOH activation, whereas chars and CO 2 -ACs generally showed an undeveloped porous matrix along with particles anchored onto the carbon structure. Furthermore, Energy-Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analyses corresponding to the SEM micrographs proved that these particles were inorganic. In particular, Ca compounds predominated in oak wood-based samples. For macroalgae-derived materials, a significant proportion of alkali (i. e. Na, K), alkaline-earth (i. e. Ca, Mg) metal ions and Cl was detected, along with high levels of Cl. Conversely, reduced or negligible levels of inorganic fractions were detected for all KOH-ACs, which confirmed that demineralization occurred upon HCl washing. The identity of inorganic species was revealed by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns. In particular, calcium oxalate and Ca(OH) 2 were identified in oak wood chars, whereas CO 2 -activated derivatives had CaCO 3 as their main crystalline phase. For macroalgae-based materials, KCl and NaCl were found to be the dominant crystalline phases. In addition, MgO was also identified in pyrolyzed seaweed and in its CO 2 -activated counterpart. By contrast, a partial or total lack of crystalline phases was found for all KOH-ACs, thus offering further evidence of the loss of inorganic species after HCl rinsing. The intrinsic alkalinity of biomass-derived chars and CO 2 -ACs was corroborated by the great amount of basic surface groups, whose number was lower for KOH-ACs. CO 2 sorptions by chars and ACs were initially measured at T= 35 °C, PCO 2 = 1 bar, and Ptot= 1 bar by using Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). Sorbents showing promising behaviour were then tested for capture of CO 2 under simulated post-combustion conditions (T= 53 °C, PCO 2 = 0. 15 bar, and Ptot= 1 bar). Unmodified ACs showed relatively high sorption capacity (up to 70 mg CO 2 ∙g- 1) at higher partial pressure and lower temperature. Nonetheless, the ACs’ sorption capability dramatically decreased at lower partial pressure and higher temperature. However, the biomass feedstocks included in this work proved to be advantageous precursors for sustainable synthesis of CO 2 -selective sorbents under post-combustion conditions. In particular, Ca(OH) 2 and MgO intrinsically incorporated within the raw materials enabled production of highly basic “CO 2 -philic” sorbents without applying any chemical modifications. The best virgin ACs also exhibited fast adsorption kinetics, excellent regeneration capacity and good durability over ten Rapid Temperature Swing Adsorption (RTSA) cycles. On the other hand, the CO 2 uptake of optimally-PEI modified commercial AC was up to 4 times higher than that achieved by the best performing unmodified AC. PEI impregnation was optimized to maximize post-combustion uptakes. In particular, the influence of various parameters (i. e. PEI loading, stirring time of the PEI/solvent/AC mixture, solvent type and sorption temperature) on the post-combustion capture capacity of the PEI-modified ACs was assessed. Interestingly, longer agitation engendered efficient dispersion of the polymer through the porous network. Additionally, a more environmentally friendly (i. e. aqueous) impregnation enabled uptakes nearly as large as those attained when the impregnation solvent was methanol, despite using lower amounts of polymer and shorter impregnation runs. In addition, when measuring uptakes under simulated post-combustion conditions but at 77 °C, optimization of aqueous PEI impregnation led to a sorption capacity larger than those achieved by the best performing PEI-loaded ACs impregnated using methanol as solvent. The use of an oak wood-derived carbon support or monoethanoloamine (MEA) as <b>impregnating</b> <b>agent</b> did not lead to any significant improvement of the CO 2 sorption capacity. On the other hand, tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) -impregnated AC slightly outperformed the optimally-PEI loaded sorbent, but the use of PEI was preferred because of its thermal stability. The addition of glycerol to the PEI/solvent/AC blend resulted in lower CO 2 uptakes but moderately faster adsorption/desorption kinetics along with comparable “amine efficiency”. In addition, PEI-loaded AC showed larger CO 2 uptakes and faster kinetics than those attained, for comparison purposes, by Zeolite- 13 X (Z 13 X). Furthermore, amine-containing ACs were found to be durable and easy to regenerate by RTSA at 120 °C. This CO 2 desorption required ca. one third of the energy needed to regenerate a 30...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{occupational exposures}} as {{risk factors for}} hairy cell leukaemia (HCL), a population-based case-control study on 121 male HCL patients and 484 controls matched for age and sex was conducted. Elevated odds ratio (OR) was found for exposure to farm animals in general: OR 2. 0, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 2 - 3. 2. The ORs were elevated for exposure to cattle, horse, hog, poultry and sheep. Exposure to herbicides (OR 2. 9, CI 1. 4 - 5. 9), insecticides (OR 2. 0, CI 1. 1 - 3. 5), fungicides (OR 3. 8, CI 1. 4 - 9. 9) and <b>impregnating</b> <b>agents</b> (OR 2. 4, CI 1. 3 - 4. 6) also showed increased risk. Certain findings suggested that recall bias may have affected the results for farm animals, herbicides and insecticides. Exposure to organic solvents yielded elevated risk (OR 1. 5, CI 0. 99 - 2. 3), as did exposure to exhaust fumes (OR 2. 1, CI 1. 3 - 3. 3). In an additional multivariate model, the ORs remained elevated for all these exposures {{with the exception of}} insecticides.

40|$|Motor neurone disease (MND) was {{studied in}} {{relation}} to various determinants in a case-control study covering nine counties in southern Sweden. A questionnaire about occupational exposures, medical history, lifestyle factors etc was given to all cases in the age range 45 - 79 and to {{a random sample of}} 500 population controls in the same age range. The questionnaires were answered by 92 cases and 372 controls, a response rate of 85 % and 75 % respectively. Among men high Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (MHORs) were obtained for electricity work (MHOR = 6. 7, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 0 - 32. 1), welding (MHOR = 3. 7, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 13. 0), and <b>impregnating</b> <b>agents</b> (MHOR = 3. 5, 95 % CI 0. 9 - 13. 1). Heritability with regard to a neurodegenerative disease or thyroid disease seemed to predispose to a risk of developing MND (OR = 2. 1, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 4. 3). The highest OR was found for the combination of such heritability, exposure to solvents, and male sex (OR = 15. 6, 95 % CI 2. 8 - 87. 0), a combination that occurred for seven cases and three controls. Hereditary factors and external exposures had a different distribution among cases with the spinal type of MND than among cases with involvement of the pyramidal tract or bulbar paresis also...|$|R
40|$|Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl {{substances}} (PFAS) {{are used}} {{in a wide range}} of products of all day life. Due to their toxicological potential, an emerging focus is directed towards their exposure to humans. This study investigated the PFAS load of consumer products in a broad perspective. Perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (C 4, C 6 -C 8, C 10 -PFSA), carboxylic acids (C 4 -C 14 -PFCA) and fluorotelomer alcohols (4 : 2, 6 : 2; 8 : 2 and 10 : 2 FTOH) were analysed in 115 random samples of consumer products including textiles (outdoor materials), carpets, cleaning and <b>impregnating</b> <b>agents,</b> leather samples, baking and sandwich papers, paper baking forms and ski waxes. PFCA and PFSA were analysed by HPLC-MS/MS, whereas FTOH were detected by GC/CI-MS. Consumer products such as cleaning agents or some baking and sandwich papers show low or negligible PFSA and PFCA contents. On the other hand, high PFAS levels were identified in ski waxes (up to about 2000 mikrog/kg PFOA), leather samples (up to about 200 mikrog/kg PFBA and 120 mikrog/kg PFBS), outdoor textiles (up to 19 mikrog/m 2 PFOA) and some other baking papers (up to 15 mikrog/m 2 PFOA). Moreover, some test samples like carpet and leather samples and outdoor materials exceeded the EU regulatory threshold value for PFOS (1 mikrog/m 2). A diverse mixture of PFASs can be found in consumer products for all fields of daily use in varying concentrations. This study proves the importance of screening and monitoring of consumer products for PFAS loads and the necessity for an action to regulate the use of PFASs, especially PFOA, in consumer products...|$|R

40|$|Per- and polyfluorinated {{chemicals}} (PFC) have inimitable properties. They {{are very}} stable, e. g. {{are resistant to}} biotic and abiotic breakdown, and are water and grease repellent. Therefore, they are used in numerous industrial applications, such as in paper- and packaging as well as textile industry. The manufacture, use, and disposal of consumer products is an important source for exposure into the environment. The persistence of PFCs, however, is problematic for the environment. A number of PFCs can be fund ubiquitously in the environment. Findings in remote regions, in human blood and breast milk are of very high concern. The most frequently detected PFCs are perfluorooctansulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Both of these compounds are persistent, toxic and bioaccumulative. While the marketing and use of PFOS is prohibited with few exceptions in the EU since June 27, 2008 there is no substance specific regulation for PFOA. Available data on PFCs in consumer products are scarce to date. Hence, more data are {{needed in order to}} get an overview on recent PFC loads and to evaluate if these data implicate further measures against PFOA with respect to a regulation according to REACH. Therefore, the Federal Environment Agency of Germany initiated an analytical screening project in 2009. Perfluorinated sulfonic (C 4, C 6 -C 8, C 10 -PFSA) and carboxylic acids (C 4 -C 14 -PFCA) and fluorotelomer alcohols (4 : 2, 6 : 2; 8 : 2 and 10 : 2 FTOH) were analyzed in 118 consumer products including textiles (outdoor materials), carpets, cleaning and <b>impregnating</b> <b>agents,</b> leather samples, baking and sandwich papers, paper baking forms and ski waxes. PFCA and PFCA were analysed by LC-ESI-MS/MS, whereas FTOH were detected by GC-CI-MS. The results show that there are consumer products with low or negligible PFSA- and PFCA-contents, such as the cleaning agents or baking and sandwich papers tested. On the other hand, high PFC levels were identified in ski waxes, leather samples, outdoor textiles and some baking papers. Moreover, the PFOS concentrations in most of the leather and carpet samples as well as some textile samples tested exceeded the regulatory threshold value of 1 ?g/m 2 PFOS according to the European PFOS regulation...|$|R
40|$|Thyroid cancer {{constitutes}} about 1 % of all malignant tumours and {{the incidence}} is increasing in Sweden. It {{is rare in}} children {{before the age of}} 10. During puberty the female to male ratio increases to be two to three times more common in females. The ratio remains constant until menopause and thereafter declines. The etiology of this gender-dependent incidence difference is unclear. Ionizing radiation is the only well-established risk factor for the disease, while the impact of other etiological factors is not clear. A retrospective study based upon medical records of 218 females and 91 males with papillary, mixed or follicular types of thyroid cancer was conducted. Prognostic factors were compared by multivariate analysis using Cox's semiparametric hazard model. Differences in prognosis between women and men were found. There was a higher relapse rate and mortality risk among men. Distant metastasis, age > 50 years, regional lymph node metastasis, low or moderate differentiation, and tumour related symptoms at diagnosis were also independent factors related to increased tumour mortality risk. A population-based case-control study including 180 cases and 360 controls was carried out to identify risk factors for thyroid cancer. Information on exposure was obtained by mailed questionnaires. The first part of the study investigated connections between medical ionizing radiation and thyroid cancer. The results showed that diagnostic X rays were a significant risk factor for papillary thyroid cancer in women between 20 and 50 years at diagnosis. Exposure to iodine- 131 caused no increased risk for thyroid cancer. The result supports that external radiotherapy is a risk factor for thyroid cancer in women. The second part of the case-control study dealt with occupation and different exposures. Work with diagnostic X-ray investigations and work as a lineman was associated with thyroid cancer. Exposure to <b>impregnating</b> <b>agents</b> increased the risk. The third part of this study showed that one pregnancy increased the risk for papillary thyroid cancer. A medical history of asthma or allergy decreased the risk. Another case-control study using medical records as the source for assessment of exposure gave a non significantly increased risk for thyroid cancer in patients who had been treated with external radiotherapy including the thyroid gland.

40|$|Considering the {{resource}} waste and environmental burden for timber and plastic materials ending up at landfills, this study proposed upcycling wood and plastic waste into value-added wood-plastic composites (WPCs), {{complying with the}} standard requirements of flexural strength, thickness swelling, water absorption and thermal insulation. Biological deterioration {{is a major concern}} of WPCs. Bacterial survival, fungal attack and algal growth of bactericide-treated WPCs were holistically analysed. Melamine resin was adopted for <b>impregnating</b> anti-microbial <b>agents</b> on the surface. All the agents showed excellent bactericidal rate (Escherichia coli), yet poly-diallyl-dimethyl-ammonium chloride (PolyDADMAC) and silver had the lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations. In terms of weight loss and strength reduction due to fungal decay (Coriolus versicolor), PolyDADMAC, silver and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) imparted the highest resistance on the WPCs. Moreover, PolyDADMAC and copper provided the most protection against algal growth (Chlorella vulgaris), and the former presented durable inhibitory effect. This study presents a value-added solution to wood/plastic waste recycling.

While recycling and combustion are ways to utilize the waste dumping amounts to waste removal. Usually combustion is the preferable method of wood waste managing. When impregnated wood is combusted, the preserving additives can act as combustion inhibitors or promotors thus influencing the wood's combustion characteristics. The combustion of impregnated wood can also be accompanied by the formation of hazardous pollutants.
