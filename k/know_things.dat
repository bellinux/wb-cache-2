25|$|The Witch {{has raised}} Rapunzel {{as her own}} daughter, keeping her locked away from {{the world in a}} tall tower {{in the middle of the}} woods, {{accessible}} only by climbing Rapunzel's long, golden hair ("Our Little World"). However, on this day a handsome prince spies the beautiful Rapunzel and resolves to climb the tower himself. In another part of the wood, the Baker has tracked down Little Red Ridinghood. Following the Witch's advice, he attempts to simply steal the red cape, but her ensuing temper tantrum guilts him into returning it. When Little Red Ridinghood arrives at her grandmother's house, she is swallowed by the Wolf. The Baker, in pursuit of the cape, slays the Wolf, pulling Little Red Ridinghood and her grandmother from the beast's innards. Little Red Riding hood rewards him with the red cape, reflecting on her new experiences ("I <b>Know</b> <b>Things</b> Now"). Meanwhile, Jack's mother angrily tosses the beans aside, which end up growing into an enormous stalk overnight, and sends her son to bed without supper. As Cinderella flees the Festival, pursued by another handsome prince and his steward, the Wife helps her hide and quizzes Cinderella about the ball. Cinderella explains that it was a nice ball ("A Very Nice Prince") but seems fairly ambivalent about the experience. As a giant beanstalk begins to sprout from the ground next to Jack's cottage, the Baker's Wife spots Cinderella's pure gold slippers. She tries to chase after Cinderella but inadvertently allows Milky White to run off, leaving the Baker's Wife without the slippers or the cow. The characters each state morals and credos as the first midnight chimes ("First Midnight") and they continue their journeys through the woods.|$|E

500|$|After {{writing his}} 2010 album Airtight's Revenge with themes {{intended}} for male listeners, Bilal wrote A Love Surreal for female listeners with lyrics about love. He described writing the album as a surrealistic exploration of love. He {{was inspired by}} the surrealism of Spanish painter Salvador Dalí, after viewing a 2005 Salvador Dalí exhibit at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. He also drew on the shelving of his unreleased album Love for Sale, which inspired A Love Surreals title. [...] "For the longest I was supposed to sign with [...] and actually put Love for Sale out, but you <b>know,</b> <b>things</b> happen", Bilal told Okayplayer. [...] "It's surreal that I'm right back at the same spot about to put out a record with them. Also, surreal – the word surrealism – my inspiration for this record, I got a lot of concepts from Salvador Dali and the way he made his art pieces, it almost looks three-dimensional, and I wanted to do that with the sound of this album. So this record is almost like a sonic art piece." [...] Bilal had wanted to sign with eOne because of the artistic freedom the label had given fellow recording artist Dwele. The album's title was also inspired by John Coltrane's 1965 album A Love Supreme.|$|E

2500|$|Because {{it covers}} both how we gain {{knowledge}} about objects and our reflections {{on our own}} actions, Piaget's model of development explains a number of features of human knowledge that had never previously been accounted for. For example, by showing how children progressively enrich their understanding of things by acting on and reflecting {{on the effects of}} their own previous knowledge, they are able to organize their knowledge in increasingly complex structures. Thus, once a young child can consistently and accurately recognize different kinds of animals, he or she then acquires the ability to organize the different kinds into higher groupings such as [...] "birds", [...] "fish", and so on. This is significant because they are now able to <b>know</b> <b>things</b> about a new animal simply {{on the basis of the}} fact that it is a bird – for example, that it will lay eggs.|$|E
