Also the phonology of Quenya was inspired by certain aspects of Finnish, but this is not easily recognised.|$|E
5|$|South of Ardnamurchan, Gaelic {{place names}} are more common, {{and after the}} 13th century, Gaelic became the main {{language}} of the entire Hebridean archipelago. Due to Scots and English being favored in government and the educational system, the Hebrides {{have been in a}} state of <b>diglossia</b> since at least the seventeenth century. The Highland Clearances of the nineteenth century accelerated the language shift away from Scottish Gaelic, as did increased migration and the continuing lower status of Gaelic speakers. Nevertheless, as late {{as the end of the}} nineteenth century, there were significant populations of monolingual Gaelic speakers, and the Hebrides still contain the highest percentages of Gaelic speakers in Scotland. This is especially true of the Outer Hebrides, where a slim majority speak the language. The Scottish Gaelic college, Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, is based on Skye and Islay.|$|E

25|$|The {{linguistic}} {{situation of}} the BP informal speech {{in relation to the}} standard language is controversial. There are authors (Bortoni, Kato, Mattos e Silva, Bagno, Perini) who describe it as a case of <b>diglossia,</b> considering that informal BP has developed– both in phonetics and grammar– in its own particular way.|$|E
25|$|Modern Telugu {{vocabulary}} {{can be said}} {{to constitute}} a <b>diglossia</b> because the formal, standardised version of the language is either lexically Sanskrit or heavily influenced by Sanskrit, is taught in schools, and is used by the government and Hindu religious institutions. However, everyday Telugu varies depending upon region and social status.|$|E
25|$|Ever {{since the}} times of Koiné Greek in Hellenistic and Roman antiquity, there was a {{competition}} between the naturally evolving spoken forms of Greek on the one hand, {{and the use of}} artificially archaic, learned registers on the other. The learned registers employed grammatical and lexical forms in imitation of classical Attic Greek (Atticism). This situation is known in modern linguistics as <b>diglossia.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, Tunisian Arabic has {{the role}} of the low variety in an example of classic <b>diglossia,</b> and Standard Arabic is the high variety. As such, the use of Tunisian Arabic is mainly {{restricted}} to spoken domains. as its written and cultural use began in the 17th century and regularly developed since the 20th century only. Now, it is used {{for a wide range of}} purposes, including communication, politics, literature, theatre, and music.|$|E
25|$|Malayalam is the {{language}} spoken by the Malayalis. Malayalam is derived from old Tamil and Sanskrit in the 6th century. For cultural purposes Malayalam and Sanskrit formed a language known as Manipravalam, where both languages were used in an alternating style. Malayalam is the only among the major Dravidian languages without <b>diglossia.</b> This means, that the Malayalam which is spoken does not differ from the written variant. Malayalam is written using the Malayalam script.|$|E
25|$|The {{language}} situation today {{consists of}} a complex relationship between several <b>diglossia,</b> since there is a functional distribution within Romansh itself between the local dialect, the regional standard variety, and nowadays the pan-regional variety Rumantsch Grischun as well; and German is also acquired in two varieties: Swiss German and Standard German. Additionally, in Val Müstair many people also speak Bavarian German as a second language. Aside from German, many Romansh also speak additional languages such as French, Italian, or English, learned at school or acquired through direct contact.|$|E
25|$|The {{linguistic}} {{varieties of}} Modern Greek {{can be classified}} along two principal dimensions. First, {{there is a long}} tradition of sociolectal variation between the natural, popular spoken language {{on the one hand and}} archaizing, learned written forms on the other. Second, there is regional variation between dialects. The competition between the popular and the learned registers (see <b>Diglossia),</b> culminated in the struggle between Dimotiki (Demotic Greek) and Katharevousa during the 19th and 20th centuries. As for regional dialects, variation within the bulk of dialects of present-day Greece is not particularly strong, except for a number of outlying, highly divergent dialects spoken by isolated communities.|$|E
25|$|Iorga's {{changing}} sentiment flowed {{between the}} extremes of Francophilia and Francophobia. The Romanian scholar explained in detail his dislike for the Third Republic's social and political landscape. He recalled that, in the 1890s, he had been shocked by the irreverence and cosmopolitanism of French student society. In a 1906 speech, Iorga also noted that Francophone elites and urban <b>diglossia</b> were slowly destroying the country's social fiber, by creating a language gap between classes. Also, Neamul Românesc showed a preference for Action Française and the French reactionary right in their conflict with the Third Republic. Shortly after the beginning of World War I, during the Battle of the Frontiers, Iorga publicized his renewed love for France, claiming {{that she was the}} only belligerent engaged in a purely defensive war; in the name of Pan-Latinism, he later chided Spain for keeping neutral.|$|E
25|$|All these {{regional}} {{varieties of}} the Occitan language are written and valid. Standard Occitan, also called occitan larg (i.e., 'wide Occitan') is a synthesis that respects and admits soft regional adaptations (which {{are based on}} the convergence of previous regional koinés). So Occitan can be considered as a pluricentric language. The standardisation process began with the publication of Gramatica occitana segon los parlars lengadocians, grammar of the languedocien dialect, by Louis Alibert (1935), followed by the Dictionnaire occitan-français selon les parlers languedociens (French-Occitan dictionary according to Languedocien) by the same author (1966), completed during the 1970s with the works of Pierre Bec (Gascon), Robèrt Lafont (Provençal) and others. But it has not been achieved yet. It is mostly supported by users of the classical norm. Due to the strong situation of <b>diglossia,</b> some users still reject the standardisation process and do not conceive Occitan as a language that could work just as other standardised languages.|$|E

500|$|Various current Chinese {{characters}} have been {{traced back to}} the late Shang Dynasty about 1200–1050 BC, but the process of creating characters is thought to have begun some centuries earlier. [...] After a period of variation and evolution, Chinese characters were standardized under the Qin Dynasty (221–206 BC). [...] Over the millennia, these {{characters have}} evolved into well-developed styles of Chinese calligraphy. As the varieties of Chinese diverged, a situation of <b>diglossia</b> developed, with speakers of mutually unintelligible varieties able to communicate through writing using Classical Chinese. In the early 20th century, Classical Chinese was replaced in this role by written vernacular Chinese, corresponding to the standard spoken language ("Mandarin"). Although most other varieties of Chinese are not written, there are traditions of written Cantonese, written Shanghainese and written Hokkien, among others.|$|E

2500|$|The {{development}} of native, Maltese literary works {{has historically been}} disrupted by <b>diglossia.</b> For many centuries, Maltese was considered [...] "the language {{of the kitchen and}} the workshop", while Italian was the language of literature, law and commerce. Until the early 20th century, the vast majority of literary works by the Maltese were written in Italian, although examples of written Maltese from {{as far back as the}} 16th century exist. In early Maltese history, <b>diglossia</b> manifested itself in the co-existence of an ancient Phoenician language and the language of a series of rulers, most notably, Latin, Greek, Arabic, Sicilian, French, Spanish and Italian, and from 1800 onwards, English. The Maltese language today is heavily overlaid with Romance and English influences as a result.|$|E

Questions about the reform and modernization of Arabic came to the fore, and for many decades to follow they were hotly debated in Egyptian intellectual circles. Proposals ranged from developing neologisms to replace archaic terminology in Standard Arabic; to the simplification of syntactical and morphological rules {{and the introduction of}} colloquialisms; to complete [...] "Egyptianization" [...] (tamṣīr) by abandoning the so-called Standard Arabic in favor of Masri or Egyptian Arabic.|$|E
2500|$|Jewish {{languages}} are generally {{defined as the}} unique linguistic varieties of Jewish communities in the diaspora in their contact with surrounding non-Jewish languages. Languages vary in their distance and divergence from their non-Jewish sister languages. For example, Judeo-Yemeni Arabic is quite similar to some non-Jewish varieties of Yemeni Arabic, while Yiddish, a Germanic language, shows {{a high degree of}} dissimilarity to modern German dialects. Due to continued liturgical and literary use of Hebrew and Aramaic, Jewish communities were naturally in a state of <b>diglossia.</b> Along with their vernacular Jewish language, most Jews could read and write in Hebrew, which was necessary to fulfill the religious commandment to learn Torah and teach it. Jews were expected to also have knowledge of Judeo-Aramaic, the language of religious commentary (targumim) as well as many prayers, including the Kaddish. Hebrew, the [...] "Holy Tongue", was the highest linguistic register in these communities, used for liturgy and study. Hebrew-Aramaic is the only adstratum shared by all Jewish languages.|$|E
2500|$|According to some {{contemporary}} Brazilian linguists (Bortoni, Kato, Mattos e Silva, Perini {{and most}} recently, with great impact, Bagno), Brazilian Portuguese {{may be a}} highly diglossic language. This theory claims {{that there is an}} L-variant (termed [...] "Brazilian Vernacular"), which would be the mother tongue of all Brazilians, and an H-variant (standard Brazilian Portuguese) acquired through schooling. L-variant represents a simplified form of the language (in terms of grammar, but not of phonetics) that could have evolved from 16th-century Portuguese, influenced by Amerindian (mostly Tupi) and African languages, while H-variant would be based on 19th-century European Portuguese (and very similar to Standard European Portuguese, with only minor differences in spelling and grammar usage). Mário A. Perini, a Brazilian linguist, even compares the depth of the differences between L- and H- variants of Brazilian Portuguese with those between Standard Spanish and European Portuguese. However, his proposal is not widely accepted by either grammarians or academics. Milton M. Azevedo wrote a chapter on <b>diglossia</b> in his monograph: Portuguese language (A linguistic introduction), published by Cambridge University Press in 2005.|$|E

5000|$|Following Ferguson's work on <b>Diglossia,</b> Fishman {{developed}} {{his theory of}} domain specificity. <b>Diglossia</b> refers to the expected use of language on a broad social level (or macro-level) and domain specificity refers {{to the use of}} language in a face-to-face conversation (micro-level).|$|E

In contrast to the language-centric notion of classical <b>diglossia,</b> the revised notion contends that <b>diglossia</b> is primarily a socio-cultural, economic and political phenomenon not necessarily accepted as a natural state of affairs by all the minority groups, the speakers of Low languages/varieties. Critical <b>diglossia</b> not only describes how language varieties and languages in a particular linguistic market are functionally distributed in formal and informal domains and their linguistic and language capitals are valued as High and Low, but also studies {{the reasons why the}} asymmetrical relationship between the language varieties and languages develops, as well as the role that historical and current political, economic and socio-cultural processes play in its construction.|$|E

5000|$|The chart below {{gives an}} example of <b>diglossia</b> in Arab-speaking nations {{and where it is}} used. <b>Diglossia</b> is defined by Mesthrie as [...] "a {{situation}} where two varieties of a language exist side by side". The Classical Arabic is known as الفصحى, or al-fuṣḥā, while the colloquial dialect depends on the country. For example, شامي, or šāmi, is spoken in Lebanon and parts of Syria. In many situations, there is a major lexical difference among words in the classical and colloquial speech, as well as pronunciation differences, such as a difference in short vowels, when the words are the same. Although, a specific example of <b>diglossia</b> was not given, its social context is almost if not more important. For example, Halliday tells us that [...] "in areas with <b>Diglossia,</b> the link between language and success is apparent as the higher, classical register is learned through formal education".|$|E
