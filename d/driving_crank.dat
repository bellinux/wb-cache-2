5000|$|Contracts for {{an initial}} six {{locomotives}} from Fenton, Murray and Jackson were signed in April 1838. They {{were of a}} design similar to that already in use on the Leeds and Selby Line. In 1842 locomotive power consisted of twelve six-wheeled engines; {{a second set of}} six were ordered from Shepherd and Todd to a revised design: a broad wheelbase of 11 ft and lateral spring spacing of 6.5 ft, along with a centrally located <b>driving</b> <b>crank</b> was employed to increase safety by reducing oscillations at speed; the design was simplified to two inner frames supporting the inner bearings creating more space in the inside frame, in order to facilitate ease of maintenance; expansive working of steam was employed for fuel efficiency; the remainder of the design was influence by contemporary best practice - 6 ft driving wheels, pistons of 2 by 1 ft stroke by diameter, and a firebox 2 by 3.5 ft with 94 fire tubes each 9.5 ft long and [...] diameter.|$|E

In this paper, double crank {{mechanism}} is put forward to achieve {{separation of the}} processing tomato fruit-stem {{on the basis of}} analysis of the existing separation mechanism kinematic characteristics, and the rod length ratio of the desired motion characteristics has been gotten by virtual simulation platform based on ADAMS, and the rod lengths of the double {{crank mechanism}} ultimately determined are as follows, <b>driving</b> <b>crank</b> is 148 mm, active crank is 178 mm, link is 222 mm, and driven crank is 200 mm {{on the basis of the}} testing determination of the maturity processing tomato fruit-stem separation force. It is able to meet the fruit and stem separation requirements when the angular velocity of driven crank is 60 r/min. It can provide a theoretical basis for engineering practice...|$|E
2500|$|A typical Crampton feature, {{previously}} used on Liverpool, was {{the large}} {{diameter of the}} outside eccentrics used to drive the valve gear. These were so large as to be larger than the <b>driving</b> <b>cranks,</b> thus avoiding {{the need for an}} overhung (and potentially weak) crank. The 17½" [...] × 24" [...] cylinders were horizontal, fed by inclined steam chests above them.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{some aspects}} {{theoretical and practical}} based on the finite element analysis and modelling of Geneva mechanism with four slots, using the CATIA graphic program. This type of mechanism {{is an example of}} intermittent gearing that translates a continuous rotation into an intermittent rotary motion. It consists of alternate periods of motion and rest without reversing direction. In this paper, some design parameters with specify a Geneva mechanism will be defined precisely such as number of <b>driving</b> <b>cranks,</b> number of slots, wheel diameter, pin diameter, etc. Finite element analysis (FEA) can be used for creating a finite element model (preprocessing) and visualizing the analysis results (postprocessing), and use other solvers for processing...|$|R

50|$|Hibernia was a steam {{locomotive}} designed by Richard Roberts and built by Sharp, Roberts and Company in 1834 for the Dublin and Kingstown Railway (D&KR). The locomotive had vertical cylinders <b>driving</b> via bell <b>cranks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Numbered as FC Turda 764.425 {{and painted}} {{in a black}} livery, the {{locomotive}} was regularly used to haul trains on the W&LLR. During 2011 the locomotive {{was taken out of}} service for an extensive overhaul. The overhaul was completed in time for the 2012 gala but in June 2013 the locomotive sheared the RHS <b>driving</b> axle <b>crank</b> web leaving Welshpool. Following this serious failure the locomotive was stored.|$|R
50|$|Pedals were {{initially}} attached to cranks connecting {{directly to the}} driven (usually front) wheel. The safety bicycle, {{as it is known}} today, came into being when the pedals were attached to a <b>crank</b> <b>driving</b> a sprocket that transmitted power to the driven wheel by means of a roller chain.|$|R
25|$|These can be {{staggered}} with {{drive to}} more than one axle, in line concentrated on one axle or in tandem with HP and LP <b>driving</b> a common <b>crank,</b> the latter system being much employed in the U.S.A {{in the early years of}} the 20th Century, notably on the Santa Fe.|$|R
50|$|The {{boat was}} built by Alexander Hart at Grangemouth to Symington's design with a {{vertical}} cylinder engine and crosshead transmitting power to a <b>crank</b> <b>driving</b> the paddlewheels.

50|$|Their first {{engine was}} built in 1830. Called Dreadnought, it ran on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. It was objected to because it was on six wheels and was sold to the Bolton & Leigh Railway. The second, the four-coupled Liverpool, later in 1830, used a <b>cranked</b> <b>driving</b> axle, and was also objected to (by George Stephenson) because the 6 ft {{diameter}} wheels were too big.|$|R
50|$|Only {{one type}} of 4-12-2 was built: the Union Pacific Railroad's 9000-series {{locomotives}}, 88 of which were built by ALCO between 1926 and 1930. These locomotives were used {{to increase the speed}} of freight trains in flat country, and were fairly successful, but were maintenance nightmares, largely because of their use of an inside third cylinder <b>driving</b> the <b>cranked</b> second <b>driving</b> axle between the frames. There was no inside valve gear to worry about, however. ALCO had obtained permission to use the conjugated valve gear invented by Sir Nigel Gresley. This system used two hinged levers connected to the outer cylinder's valves to operate the inner cylinder's valve. The 9000 class locomotives were the largest to use Gresley gear.|$|R
5000|$|Symington {{designed}} a new hull around his powerful horizontal engine, with the <b>crank</b> <b>driving</b> a large paddle wheel {{in a central}} upstand in the hull, aimed at avoiding damage to the canal banks. The new boat was 56 ft long, 18 ft wide and 8 ft depth, with a wooden hull. After {{a model of the}} boat was made and shown to Lord Dundas, the boat was built by John Allan, and the engine by the Carron Company.|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanical}} sequencer {{having a}} rotatable drive shaft is described. The drive shaft has a spline formed thereon. A freely rotatable shaft contains {{a plurality of}} rollers positioned thereon, the axis of the freely rotatable shaft having an axis parallel to and offset from the axis of the drive shaft. A drive fitting has an opening therein, the drive fitting being positioned on the drive shaft spline for rotating the fitting with the shaft. A finger is formed integral with the drive fitting for enabling the fitting to move the rollers and the freely rotatable shift. A crank structure is positioned in a plane in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the drive shaft and the freely rotatable shaft. The crank structure has a drive shaft opening through which the shaft passes. The crank structure further contains a slot into which the freely rotatable shaft and one of the rollers extends for <b>driving</b> the <b>crank</b> structure during movement of the freely rotatable shaft...|$|R
50|$|The {{boat was}} built by Alexander Hart at Grangemouth to Symington's design with a {{vertical}} cylinder engine and crosshead transmitting power to a <b>crank</b> <b>driving</b> the paddlewheels. Trials on the River Carron in June 1801 were successful. This first boat may have been named Charlotte Dundas and the trials apparently included towing sloops from the river Forth up the Carron and thence along the Forth and Clyde Canal. There was concern about wave damage to the canal banks, and possibly the boat {{was found to be}} underpowered on the canal, so the canal company refused further trials.|$|R
50|$|In 1801, Symington {{patented}} {{a horizontal}} steam engine {{directly linked to}} a crank. He got support from Lord Dundas to build a second steamboat, which became famous as the Charlotte Dundas, named in honour of Lord Dundas's daughter. Symington designed a new hull around his powerful horizontal engine, with the <b>crank</b> <b>driving</b> a large paddle wheel in a central upstand in the hull, aimed at avoiding damage to the canal banks.The new boat was 56 ft (17.1 m) long, 18 ft (5.5 m) wide and 8 ft (2.4 m) depth, with a wooden hull. The boat was built by John Allan and the engine by the Carron Company.|$|R
50|$|This {{design with}} its low {{stress on the}} rails, low {{inherent}} resistance and simple weight compensation was promising especially as it also avoided the use of <b>cranked</b> <b>driving</b> axles. Similar thoughts in the USA during the 1930s {{led to the development}} of duplex locomotives. Because the cylinders of adjacent axles also had 28 mm of side play, the locomotive could negotiate radii of as little as 170 m. Through the special design of the cylinders, the use of crank axles (Kropfachse) was avoided. Whilst this design enabled the steam lines between the high- and low-pressure cylinders to be extremely short, long admission and exhaust tubes were necessary.|$|R
40|$|The big {{advantage}} of LED is the flexible spectral design to make white light using different color mixing schemes. Recently, the color mixing of RGB LEDs is mostly done by sealing all three chips at single package and regulated the mix ratio {{of these three}} colors to produce the color of light. And, by changing the LEDs array alignment, RGB chips can achieve overlapping colors of light and create the fun of changing colors in light mixing. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study is to propose an innovative technique of light mixing. By applying the mechanism design, a RGB light mixing mechanism is produced. Each of the RGB LEDs lamp-type is installed on the couple link of the three mechanisms, respectively. By <b>driving</b> a <b>crank</b> makes the couple link and an output link to produce the relative motion, this will result in the fact that the RGB lamps can project lights on the same plane in order to obtain the color mixing. Unlike mixing technique by control system, this design generates light mixing and changes of color with the synchronized driving of three mechanisms, thus achieving the dazzling perception of single-color lights or mixing of multiple colors for creating ambience of a space...|$|R
40|$|Polyphase {{induction}} motor, when {{started from}} rest with full voltage impressed, the starting current is 5 to 8 {{or more times}} the rated current. The large line current drawn by such a motor is objectionable because of the possible sharp drop in voltage of the supply circuit and undesired effects upon other connected loads/devices. Accordingly it is customary to start such motors at reduced voltage by using auto transformers, star delta starters etc. This paper deals with {{a new approach to}} start poly phase induction motors without using any primary voltage compensators thereby limiting the inrush of starting current. The rotor of the motor is driven at suitable speed in the specified direction of rotation by using <b>crank</b> <b>driving</b> mechanism. Then te rated voltage is applied to the motor. This is enunciated using a case study on a 3 - phase, 5 hp, NGEF make motor with oscillographic records obtained from the experimentation and is compared with the various starting techniques. &# 13; &# 13; Keywords: Induction motor, starter, inrush current, voltage dip, new approac...|$|R
2500|$|Cornwall was {{an attempt}} to avoid the {{damaging}} long wheelbase of the Cramptons, whilst still permitting large driving wheels. By moving the driving axle ahead of the firebox, one of the carrying axles could be moved backwards, giving a shorter overall wheelbase. The difficulty of how to fit the axles past the boiler recurred, to which Trevithick provided an [...] "extremely complicated" [...] solution. The boiler was placed entirely underneath the driving axle. Even then, it was necessary to recess a transverse channel {{across the top of the}} boiler, so as to provide clearance for the driving axle. The trailing carrying axle passed through a crosswise tube through the middle of the firebox. This made assembly difficult, but as it was only a straight carrying axle rather than a <b>cranked</b> <b>driving</b> axle, the tube diameter required was manageable. This use of a cross-firebox axle tube was part of Crampton's patent of 1842. As completed in 1847, and first numbered 173, Cornwall was a 4-2-2 with 8'6" [...] drivers, paired leading wheels of 3'6", single trailing wheels of 4' and an overall wheelbase of 16'6". This is the condition in which she was exhibited at The Great Exhibition of 1851.|$|R
5000|$|... “The {{record is}} extreme,” vocalist Dez Fafara told Revolver magazine. “And it attacks {{from start to}} finish. If you liked 2007's The Last Kind Words, this is like that on steroids and <b>crank,</b> <b>driving</b> a Buick Skylark 200 miles an hour {{straight}} to Vegas.” “I felt like I was waking up and experiencing a moment of clarity that brought out all these pissed off, negative emotions,” Fafara said of making the album. “It’s an all-out release of pain. “It’s been a beast of {{a year and a}} half, and it’s still going,” he added. Regarding the new album’s musical direction, drummer John Boecklin stated, “It’s interesting to me — it’s not the fastest shit we have done, nor the slowest, it just has lots of groove. But to me, when people say ‘it’s got groove,’ I think it’s a nice way of saying simple and boring these days. We wanted to avoid this. “Our record has a great contrast of dark riffs, stomp bouncing drums with the right amount of blasts and double bass, and outstanding vocal delivery from Dez that takes it past your average approach of the metal attempt. I’m not talking about reinventing the wheel or nothing. I just think our new album sits in its own corner from any of our other albums.” The band recorded 14 songs during the Beast sessions, with 12 tracks making the standard version of the CD and all 14 songs appearing on the special edition.|$|R
