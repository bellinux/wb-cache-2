Management income smoothing behavior is taken as a measurable surrogate for the objectivity of the management results-reporting practices. This research involved the testing of one research problem. The research question asks, "Will the establishment of outside audit committees by companies that had no such committees prior to the New York Stock Exchange <b>mandate</b> <b>effective</b> June 30, 1978, be associated with a decrease in the degree of smoothing in the net income series for the period after that date relative to the degree of smoothing prior to that date?"

Linear and semi-log regression models were used to measure each firm's degree of income smoothing (defined as reducing the variability of a net income series about its trend line). The change in mean square errors of the experimental and control groups was compared using the chisquare and median tests.

40|$|This mixed methods study {{draws on}} Sensemaking Theory (Weick, 1995) and Activity Theory (Engeström, 1987) to {{understand}} how teachers experience mandated programs, curriculum, and other activities associated with large- and small-scale reform efforts. The complex nature of teachers' practice, as they are situated in this nexus of reforms, is a largely unexamined area {{in the field of}} education. Missing from the research literature is a study that explicitly combines these constructs in an examination of how teachers experience about mandates. Study participants included nine teachers at an elementary school in Southern California who had contrasting orientations toward teaching and learning, a range of teaching experience, and varying attitudes toward mandated change. Surveys, interviews, and questionnaires were used to examine how teachers conceptualized mandates, felt about mandates, perceived mandates, and talked about implementing them. The study yielded four findings. First, several factors play a role in how teachers define and interpret mandates, which leads to contrasting notions of what mandates are and which activities are mandated. Secondly, teachers approach their practice with agency. Thus, they tend to adapt mandates and have a strong desire for autonomy. Third, teachers tend to have negative attitudes toward mandates, as well as negative feelings associated with implementing mandates. As such, teacher's personal lives can be adversely affected. Finally, there are distinct features of mandates that teachers believe have positively and negatively impacted their practice: <b>effective</b> <b>mandates</b> have goals that were realized and fairly moderate rules, whereas ineffective mandates have goals that are not realized and strict or permissive rules. The {{results of this study suggest}} that teachers will thrive in environments in which they are allowed to express their autonomy. Conversely, if teachers practice in constraining environments, their professional identities and emotions may suffer. Therefore, administrators should create supportive environments, provide adequate resources, and encourage teachers to modify mandates. In addition, because there is so much variation in how teachers defined and thought about mandates, it is important that administrators clearly communicate their expectations and whether certain activities are mandated, especially as new mandates are introduce...|$|R

40|$|Drug {{addiction}} is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by {{loss of control}} over motivated behavior. The need for <b>effective</b> treatments <b>mandates</b> {{a greater understanding of}} the causes and identification of new therapeutic targets for drug development. Drugs of abuse subjugate normal reward-related behavior to uncontrollable drug-seeking and -taking. Contributions of brain reward circuitry are being mapped with increasing precision. The role of synaptic plasticity in addiction and underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to the formation of the addicted state are being delineated. Thus we may now consider the role of striatal signal transduction in addiction from a more integrative neurobiological perspective. Drugs of abuse alter dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in medium spiny neurons of the striatum. Dopamine receptors important for reward serve as principle targets of drugs abuse, which interact with glutamate receptor signaling critical for reward learning. Complex networks of intracellular signal transduction mechanisms underlying these receptors are strongly stimulated by addictive drugs. Through these mechanisms, repeated drug exposure alters functional and structural neuroplasticity, resulting in transition to the addicted biological state and behavioral outcomes that typify addiction. Ca 2 + and cAMP represent key second messengers that initiate signaling cascades, which regulate synaptic strength and neuronal excitability. Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are fundamental mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity that are dysregulated by drugs of abuse. Increased understanding of the regulatory mechanisms by which protein kinases and phosphatases exert their effects during normal reward learning and the addiction process may lead to novel targets and pharmacotherapeutics with increased efficacy in promoting abstinence and decreased side effects, such as interference with natural reward, for drug addiction...|$|R
