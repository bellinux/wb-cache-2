5000|$|It {{apparently}} {{originated in}} a void containing and surrounding the Universe, a place {{referred to in}} the novel as the [...] "Macroverse" [...] (a concept similar to the later established [...] "Todash Darkness" [...] of the Dark Tower novels). At several points in the novel, It claims its true name is [...] "Robert Gray", and is christened [...] "It" [...] by the group of children who later confront it. Throughout the book, It is generally referred to as male; however, late in the book, the protagonists come to believe It may be female (due to It's manifestation as a large female spider). In addition, upon seeing its true form Audra Denbrough says; [...] "oh dear Jesus, It is female." [...] Despite this, its true form is never truly known. The final physical form It takes, is that of an enormous spider; but this is the closest the human mind can understand. Its actual form is not precisely what the children actually see. It's natural form exists in a realm beyond the physical, which It calls the [...] "deadlights". Bill Denbrough comes dangerously close to seeing the <b>deadlights,</b> but successfully defeats It before this happens. The <b>deadlights</b> are never seen, and its true form outside the physical realm is never revealed, only described as writhing, destroying orange lights. Coming {{face to face with the}} <b>deadlights</b> drives any living being instantly insane (a common Lovecraftian device). The only known person to face the <b>deadlights</b> and survive is Bill's wife Audra Phillips, although she is rendered catatonic by the experience.|$|R
