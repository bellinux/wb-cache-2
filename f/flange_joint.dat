40|$|A {{number of}} {{high-rise}} latticed tower structures {{are made of}} steel tubular members. To facilitate the construction, the tower legs are constructed by connecting the steel tubular members with bolted <b>flange</b> <b>joints.</b> Under the wind load, the bolts of the <b>flange</b> <b>joints</b> may loosen; and this may endanger {{the safety of the}} tower if the bolt looseness and its locations cannot be detected and repaired timely. This paper proposes a new method for identifying the damage locations of bolt looseness of bolted <b>flange</b> <b>joints</b> at tower legs based on the abrupt changes of the structural responses of the towers to the wind load. The bolt looseness is reflected by the reduction of the bending rigidity of elements in the stiffness matrix of the beam element model which is equivalent to the refined solid finite element model of the <b>flange</b> <b>joints.</b> A vector composed of the standardized mean square deviations of the wind-induced longitudinal strain responses at <b>flange</b> <b>joints</b> in a damaged state of the tower related to those in its undamaged state is used as a damage index. It has been shown that the damage index is sensitive to the damage locations but independent of the wind load. Hence. the damage index can be used to identify the damage locations of the bolt looseness at the <b>flange</b> <b>joints.</b> Finally, the proposed method is applied to a latticed steel tubular tower, which shows that the proposed method can accurately identify the damage locations of bolt looseness.

40|$|Abstract: The {{performance}} of a bolted <b>flange</b> <b>joint</b> is characterized mainly by its ‘strength ’ and ‘sealing capability’.

40|$|Bolted {{flanged joints}} {{comprise}} an assembly {{of a number}} of important individual components, which are required to perform well together in service. The ideal requirement for a bolted <b>flange</b> <b>joint</b> is a 'zero-leak' condition. However, whilst recommended design procedures for bolted flange joints are available in international codes and standards, leakage problems are still faced by industry. These are common in both normal operating (internal pressure loading) and critical event conditions. The drive is, therefore, to find a <b>flange</b> <b>joint</b> assembly, which provides 'zero-leak condition' and requires little or no maintenance and handling. Considerable investigation in the area of optimised bolted joints has been in progress for the past 10 years comparing traditional gasketed joints and 'compact non-gasketed' joints, using both analytical and experimental approaches. In this present study, two-dimensional non-linear finite element studies have been performed for both gasketed and non-gasketed bolted flange pipe joints. Based on the stress results for the flange and the bolt and the flange rotation/displacement, compact non-gasketed flange joints are shown to be a viable and preferable alternative to the conventional gasketed flange joints. Recommendations are made for a best-fit flange model for static load conditions with 'zero-leak' sealing in a <b>flange</b> <b>joint...</b>|$|E

40|$|An {{appropriate}} flange tightening {{methods for}} small bore and low rating piping <b>flange</b> <b>joints</b> are clarified {{to improve the}} sealing performance of the bolted <b>flange</b> <b>joints</b> and the workability of flange tightening work. It is said that lubricant on the screw of the bolts and the nut-seating surface can minimize the variability of axial force acting on flange bolts, while this process might {{make it harder to}} tight the bolts uniformly especially for small bore low rating flanges. So, in this paper the appropriate condition to apply lubricant is clarified by a series of bolt tightening tests and sealing tests results. On the other hand, for the bolted flanges applying spiral wound gaskets, measuring the gasket compress dimensions help us to prevent uneven tightening balance and to perform the appropriate tightening work. Appropriate gasket compress dimensions are also clarified to ensure the sealing performance for the flanges based on the sealing tests results. Based on these test results, recommended flange-tightening methods have been summarized as an instruction and tightening work procedure to improve the sealing performance of the bolted flanges and the workability of flange tightening work...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn a Metal-to-Metal Contact (MMC) bolted <b>flange</b> <b>joint</b> {{the stress}} of sealing {{surfaces}} is constant. It canwithstand higherbolt load. So, under the operating conditions of high temperature, high pressure or their fluctuations, the sealing effect of MMC bolted flange joints is better than of floating (FLT) bolted flange joints. According to the structure characteristics of MMC bolted flange joints, a new tightening method (SH-Method) was recommended in this work. The bolt forces during the tightening process of a MMC bolted <b>flange</b> <b>joint</b> with SH-Method were calculated and analyzed with the finite element analysis Software ANSYS.

40|$|Tightness of <b>flange</b> <b>joints</b> {{for large}} {{polyethylene}} pipes – Part 2 Full scale experimental investigationsLeakage that sometimes occurs in <b>flange</b> <b>joints</b> in large size plastic pipelines for water supply {{is a serious}} problem. Research was undertaken {{in order to improve}} the knowledge about the function of such <b>flange</b> <b>joints.</b> The objectives were partly to find out the degree of sensitivity of the design, i e if small deviations from recommended practise is critical, partly to be able to suggest improved design and mounting procedures. One part of the investigation was a numerical (FEM) study of several geometries, which was reported in [2]. Use of a time-dependent material model made it possible to follow the development of deformations and flange surface pressures for long times. Although several important principal findings were made, the tightening procedure and exact material behaviour could not be modelled. Therefore a series of full-scale experiments were made on 630 mm pipes, for a number of combinations of flange dimension and gasket type. This second part of the research is reported here. Since four of the twenty bolts were instrumented, the bolt forces could be monitored and be related to the torque and to the pressure in the pipe over time. This resulted in novel, important information about the functioning of plastic <b>flange</b> <b>joints.</b> In short, the experiments were performed in the following way. First, the bolts were tightened in the recommended criss-cross fashion to pre-determined torque levels. Then the pressure in the pipe was increased until leakage occurred. For combinations of flanges, gaskets and torques where the joint was tight for pressures above 13 bars, the 13 bar pressure level was maintained for up to one week. The relationship between bolt force and torque does not agree at all with the frequently used rule of thumb formula, for the galvanized bolts used here. The bolt force was typically less than half the value obtained by the formula. Hence it is critical to verify the friction for the used combination of bolt material, surface treatment, and lubrication. The bolt forces also appear to be unevenly distributed, which is partly due to successive creep during the tightening procedure. For the high stresses in the flange creep is significant already for so short times as a few minutes, and the effect is increased {{by the fact that the}} bolts and backing rings are much stiffer than the plastic flange. For both the wide and the narrow (ISO) flange type used it appears that rubber gaskets perform better, in the sense that the joint is tight for lower applied torques. The hyper- elastic material properties help to smooth unevenness in the flange surface and to compensate for creep in the plastic. Use of SDR 17 pipes at pressure levels of 13 bars means considerable creep expansion of the pipe, although it is possible to obtain a tight joint. The expansion gives a wringing effect at the flange, also observed in [2], which contributes to concentrate the flange pressure to the outer parts of the flange surface. In summary, <b>flange</b> <b>joints</b> are possible to mount so that they are tight, also for 630 mm pipes. Since the design is a sensitive one it is vital to follow recommendations for 4 mounting of different combinations of flanges and gaskets. In particular, knowledge about the relationship between torque and bolt force is important...|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} known that {{resonance}} can quickly lead to failure in vibrating bolted flanged pipe joints. Condition monitoring is performed {{time to time}} in some industries for smooth operation of a system, whereas mostly trial-and-error tests are performed to control vibration. During all this process, the inherent design problems are not considered. A bolted <b>flange</b> <b>joint</b> in piping system is not a simple problem, being the combination of flange, gasket, bolts, and washers. The success of a bolted flanged pipe joint is defined by the “static mode of load” in the joint. However, it has been recognized that a “dynamic mode of load” governs in a gasketed bolted flanged pipe joint, which leads to its failure due to flange rotation, providing flange yielding, fatigue of bolts, and gasket crushing.

40|$|Purpose: The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{describe}} the modelling of large flexible objects in which bolted joints are used and also to present a new FEM calculation methodology of these objects. Design/methodology/approach: In bolted flange joints of flexible constructional elements, bolts are subject not only to tension and torsion but also to bending. Identification of straining of each bolt is only possible by means of numerical methods e. g. the finite element method FEM. In case of large objects, the calculation problem is faithful projection of the phenomena taking place in direct zone of the contact of screw-nut pair. The application of global equivalent models of the whole joint is necessary, to make it possible to precisely determine internal loads in individual bolts and then local models to determine stress fields necessary to assign durability. Calculation methodology based on the construction of two coherent models has been described: global - of an entire <b>flange</b> <b>joint,</b> and local - of a single bolt joint. Findings: The elaborated methodology was applied to estimate the <b>flange</b> <b>joint</b> in the heat exchanger with rotating heating surfaces that was subject to damage. The causes of damage of <b>flange</b> <b>joint</b> were found. Practical implications: Used methodology of FEM modelling of bolted flange joints based on two coherent models may be applied for different similar objects. The paper provides detailed description of methodology steps. Originality/value: The described methodology may be successfully applied to the analysis of large objects, however, significant geometric features with dimensions small in relation to dimensions of the whole object. Thanks to the application of two coherent models, it is possible to reflect all essential phenomena in the FEM model, both in the global scale - of the entire object, and local – a significant fragment of the joint...|$|E

Nevertheless, there exists an inadequacy of proper seismic analysis and design rules for a piping system and its components.

Along this line, this paper discusses about the main issues on the seismic analysis and design of industrial piping systems and components.
