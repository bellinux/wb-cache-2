5|$|The {{accuracy}} of hurricane forecast models can vary significantly from storm to storm. For some storms the factors affecting the hurricane track are relatively straightforward, and the models {{are not only}} accurate but they produce similar forecasts, while for other storms the factors affecting the hurricane track are more complex and <b>different</b> <b>models</b> produce very different forecasts.|$|E
5|$|About 260 {{models of}} lorry were produced, which were fitted with 35 types of engine, 20 {{different}} gearboxes, and 15 to 20 types of cabin. Many {{of the models}} were produced in small numbers, with 116 types only being represented by one or two units. Most of the differences came from special wheelbases that always needed approval from the authorities. In many cases, it is impossible even for experts to identify <b>different</b> <b>models</b> and years of production. There were 66 types of bus chassis produced, {{and the number of}} different body types built on them by various coach builders and operators is unknown.|$|E
5|$|In October, {{the second}} unit {{travelled}} to Nassau to film the underwater sequences. To perform the car becoming a submarine, seven <b>different</b> <b>models</b> were used, {{one for each}} step of the transformation. One of the models was a fully mobile submarine equipped with an engine built by Miami-based Perry Submarines. The car seen entering the sea was a mock-up shell, propelled off the jetty by a compressed air cannon. During the model sequences, the air bubbles seen appearing from the vehicle were created by Alka-Seltzer tablets.|$|E

5|$|In the 1930s, T-26 light {{tanks were}} {{delivered}} to Spain (281), China (82) and Turkey (60). They {{were used in}} the Second Sino-Japanese War by the Chinese from 1938–1944, especially in the Battle of Kunlun Pass. The Finnish Army used captured T-26s of <b>different</b> <b>models</b> during the Continuation War and some tanks served in Finland for various non-combat purposes until 1961. Captured T-26s were also used by the German, Romanian and Hungarian armies.|$|E
5|$|On 9 May 1945, {{only two}} Panzer IVs were left. Romania {{received}} another 50 Panzer IV tanks from the Red Army {{after the end}} of the war. These tanks were of <b>different</b> <b>models</b> and were in very poor shape—many of them were missing parts and the side skirts. The T4 tanks remained in service until 1950, when the Army decided to use only Soviet equipment. By 1954, all German tanks had been scrapped.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- The {{development}} of simulation enables {{the researchers to}} explore more sophisticated problems at a more detailed level. At the same time this implies a necessity to use several <b>models,</b> or even <b>different</b> <b>modelling</b> tools. <b>Different</b> <b>modelling</b> approaches (multi agent systems, discrete events simulation, system dynamics, etc.) usually envisage the use of <b>different</b> <b>modelling</b> tools (software). This makes the issue of their mutual communication a central concern to the researcher. There are several solutions, but they are complicated and not suitable for people without specific knowledge. The aim of the article is introduction to new and easy communication environment which {{would be used to}} substitute HLA and other more expensive tools...|$|R
5|$|The {{advanced}} {{clean car}} rules program {{was made to}} reduce tail pipe emissions. The Air Resources Board approved the program to control emissions for newer models from the year 2017 to 2025. Some of their goals by 2025 are to have more environmentally superior cars to be available in <b>different</b> <b>models</b> and different types of cars. New automobiles will emit 34 percent fewer global warming gases and 75 percent fewer smog-forming emissions. And if fully implemented consumers can save an average of $6,000 {{over the life of}} the car.|$|E
5|$|The fan {{diameter}} {{varies with}} the <b>different</b> <b>models</b> of the CFM56, and that change has {{a direct impact on}} the engine performance. For example, the low-pressure shaft rotates at the same speed for both the CFM56-2 and the CFM56-3 models; the fan diameter is smaller on the -3, which lowers the tip speed of the fan blades. The lower speed allows the fan blades to operate more efficiently (5.5% more in this case), which increases the overall fuel efficiency of the engine (improving specific fuel consumption nearly 3%).|$|E
5|$|The {{phylogeny}} of Anthozoans is {{not clearly}} understood {{and a number}} of <b>different</b> <b>models</b> have been proposed. Within the Hexacorallia, the sea anemones, coral anemones and stony corals may constitute a monophyletic grouping united by their six-fold symmetry and cnidocyte trait. The Octocorallia appears to be monophyletic, and primitive members of this group may have been stolonate. The cladogram presented here comes from a 2014 study by Stampar et al. which was based on the divergence of mitochondrial DNA within the group and on nuclear markers.|$|E

5|$|A Leslie speaker {{consists}} {{of a number of}} individual components. The audio signal enters the amplifier from the instrument. Once amplified, the signal travels to an audio crossover, which splits it into separate frequency bands that can be individually routed to each loudspeaker. <b>Different</b> <b>models</b> have different combinations of speakers, but the most common model, the 122, {{consists of}} a single woofer for bass and a single compression driver and acoustic horn for treble. The audio emitted by the speakers is isolated inside an enclosure, aside from a number of outlets that lead towards either a rotating horn or drum. An electric motor rotates both horn and drum at a constant speed.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the Commonwealth formation, there was little {{practical}} difference between the Polish and Lithuanian components; the Lithuanian component formed about a fourth to a third of the Commonwealth army. The army of the Commonwealth was organized along several <b>different</b> <b>models,</b> with the primary division being that into two 'contingents' or 'enlistments' (or in Polish: autorament): national and foreign. The name applied to types of formation, regulations and the officer cadres; the majority of regular recruits for both came from within the Commonwealth, particularly from the 1630s onward. National units included the towarzysz cavalry (including the Polish hussars and lighter pancerni (Polish) and petyhorcy (Lithuanian) units) and some light cavalry units, with infantry being the distant second in reputation; whereas the foreign units were primarily centered around the infantry and artillery formations, with dragoons gaining prominence from the 1620s, and reiter cavalry soon afterward.|$|E

The company, however, had only moderate sales and fluctuating commercial success. In late 1915, he was seriously injured in a mishap at a flying demonstration in Abilene, Texas, and thereafter the barnstormer devoted most of his time to architecture and design. He also took some time off beginning in 1917 when America entered the First World War – for nearly two years, he served as chief inspector of aircraft at the nation's first military aviation research and development center, McCook Field in Ohio.|$|E
5|$|The {{struggle}} for Huế and Da Nang had cost South Vietnam its entire army corps, namely the {{units of the}} ARVN 1st Brigade, I Corps Tactical Zone. According to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam's official history, apart from the 16,000 soldiers and civilians who managed to escape, over 120,000 South Vietnamese soldiers were killed, wounded or captured {{after the fall of}} Huế and Da Nang. In their attempt to abandon the territories of I Corps, the South Vietnamese military left behind vast quantities of U.S.-supplied military hardware. The North Vietnamese claimed to have captured 129 aircraft of <b>different</b> <b>models,</b> 179 tanks and armoured vehicles, 327 artillery pieces, 184 transport vehicles and 47 naval crafts. More than 10,000 tons of bombs, ammunition, grenades, food supplies, combat rations, and other materials were also captured. Total North Vietnamese and Viet Cong casualties are largely unknown.|$|E
5|$|The Panzer IV was {{the most}} {{exported}} German tank of the Second World War. In 1942, Germany delivered 11 tanks to Romania and 32 to Hungary, {{many of which were}} lost on the Eastern Front between the final months of 1942 and the beginning of 1943 during the battles around Stalingrad. Romania received approximately 120 Panzer IV tanks of <b>different</b> <b>models</b> throughout the entire war. To arm Bulgaria, Germany supplied 46 or 91 Panzer IVs, and offered Italy 12 tanks to form the nucleus of a new armored division. These were used to train Italian crews while the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was deposed, but were retaken by Germany during its occupation of Italy in mid-1943. The Spanish government petitioned for 100 Panzer IVs in March 1943, but only 20 were ever delivered, by December. Finland bought 30, but only received 15 in 1944, and the same year a second batch of 62 or 72 was sent to Hungary (although 20 of these were diverted to replace German losses). In total, 297 Panzer IVs of all models were delivered to Germany's allies.|$|E

5|$|When Backer et al. {{reported}} their finding in November 1982, {{they found that}} the rotation period of PSR B1937+21 was increasing at a rate of 3 seconds per second. Pulsars are expected to slow over time, as the energy that they emit is ultimately drawn from the rotational energy of the pulsar. Using the initially observed values for the period and spin down rate, and assuming a minimum period of 0.5 milliseconds for pulsars, the maximum age for PSR B1937+21 was found to be about 750 years old. The estimate of the minimum possible period is obtained from the centrifugal break-up limit, which is the rotational period at which the centrifugal force and the self-gravity of the pulsar are equal. The value of the minimum rotational period depends upon the neutron star equation of state, with <b>different</b> <b>models</b> giving values between 0.3 and 1 millisecond, which corresponds to a rotation frequency of 1-3 kilohertz. There may be mechanisms such as gravitational radiation which keep the pulsar from reaching this absolute limit, but pulsars can spin no faster.|$|E
