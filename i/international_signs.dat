25|$|While {{the sign}} system in ISL {{appears to be}} largely indigenous, {{elements}} in ISL are derived from British Sign Language. For example, most ISL signers nowadays use fingerspelling based on British Sign Language fingerspelling, with only isolated groups using an indigenous devanagari-based fingerspelling system (for example, Deaf students and graduates of the school for the deaf in Vadodara/Baroda, Gujarat). In addition, more recently contact with foreign Deaf has resulted in rather extensive borrowing from <b>International</b> <b>Signs</b> and (either directly or via <b>International</b> <b>Signs)</b> from American Sign Language. A small number of the Deaf in and around Bengaluru are often said to use American Sign Language (owing to a longstanding ASL deaf school there); however it is probably more correct {{to say that they}} use a lexicon based largely on ASL (or Signed English), while incorporating also a not inconsequential ISL element. Furthermore, regardless of the individual signs used, the grammar used is clearly ISL and not ASL.|$|E

50|$|Lithuanian Sign Language (LGK) (Lithuanian: Lietuvių gestų kalba) is the {{national}} sign language used in Lithuania, with several regional variants. Very {{little is known about}} its history before 1945. From 1945 to 1990 it was used along with Russian Sign Language and the two sign languages became very similar. Russian lip-patterns used with some LGK signs indicate that the sign may have been originally borrowed from Russian Sign Language. When Lithuania became independent, its contacts with Russian Sign Language were almost cut off, and now it's developing as an independent language, with some influence from <b>international</b> <b>signs.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{nature of}} <b>International</b> <b>Sign</b> Pidgin has been {{recently}} described and discussed in various studies and papers (Moody 1987; Coppock 1990; Supalla 1991; Padden 1993; Scott Gibson & Ojala 1994; Webb & Supalla 1994, 1995; Allsop, Woll & Brauti 1995; Allsop 1996; Bergmann 1996). Although <b>international</b> <b>sign</b> {{has been used}} in interpreting for almost twenty years, no empirical research has described the unique phenomenon of <b>international</b> <b>sign</b> interpreting. This study analyses data samples of interpretation from spoken English into <b>International</b> <b>Sign</b> Pidgin at <b>international</b> conferences and sports meetings. Predominant linguistic characteristics of the target language output are identified in the first section, while the second section describes strategies that international interpreters use to manage the task of processing input while producing a comprehensible message in a partially improvised language form. Examples demonstrate how international interpreters take a free approach to interpretation, aiming for equivalence at text level in most instances. International interpreters are shown to be more than conduits, as their interpreting decisions indicate extensive use of contextual knowledge, inferencing, audience awareness, and considerations of relevance and efficiency in the process of interpretation. 28 page(s...|$|R
