5|$|The cost of Nevada Solar One is in {{the range}} of $220–250million. The power {{produced}} is slightly more <b>expensive</b> <b>than</b> wind power, but was less than photovoltaic (PV) power. As photovoltaics became less expensive, some proposed CSP projects have been converted to photovoltaics projects.|$|E
5|$|The {{product of}} a quadruple VAM (vacuum arc melting) process, {{combined}} with hot extruding and different rolling applications is cured using high-pressure, high-temperature gas autoclaving. This produces reactor-grade zirconium that is about 10 times more <b>expensive</b> <b>than</b> the hafnium-contaminated commercial grade.|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{production}} {{with the}} ISP is more <b>expensive</b> <b>than</b> with electrolytic zinc plants, so several smelters operating this technology have closed in recent years. However, ISP furnaces {{have the advantage}} of being able to treat zinc concentrates containing higher levels of lead than can electrolytic zinc plants.|$|E
5000|$|Published in November 2008, Kramers Ergot 7 {{features}} almost 60 {{artists and}} is larger (16" [...] by 21") and more <b>expensive</b> ($125) <b>than</b> previous editions.|$|R

50|$|Egnater {{collaborated with}} Randall Amplifiers for the Randall MTS series of guitar {{amplifiers}} and preamplifiers, which {{follow the same}} modular design but use less <b>expensive</b> parts <b>than</b> Egnater's own amplifiers.|$|R
5|$|A related process, {{flux-cored}} {{arc welding}} (FCAW), uses similar equipment but uses wire {{consisting of a}} steel electrode surrounding a powder fill material. This cored wire is more <b>expensive</b> <b>than</b> the standard solid wire and can generate fumes and/or slag, but it permits even higher welding speed and greater metal penetration.|$|E
5|$|Although Jersey {{does not}} have VAT, the States of Jersey {{introduced}} a goods and services tax (GST) on 6 May 2008, at a standard rate of 3%. The rate was amended to 5% on 1 June 2011. Although GST is at 5%, shopping in Jersey is still far more <b>expensive</b> <b>than</b> in the UK. Food is not exempt, unlike with VAT.|$|E
5|$|Amyloid imaging {{is likely}} to be used in {{conjunction}} with other markers rather than as an alternative. Volumetric MRI can detect changes in the size of brain regions. Measuring those regions that atrophy during the progress of Alzheimer's disease is showing promise as a diagnostic indicator. It may prove less <b>expensive</b> <b>than</b> other imaging methods currently under study.|$|E

5|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} produce significant, although usually mild, {{side effects}} including drowsiness, hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation. Sometimes side effects appear {{even at a}} minimal clinically effective dose, leading the physician {{to search for a}} different drug. Agonists have been related to impulse control disorders (such as compulsive sexual activity, eating, gambling and shopping) even more strongly than levodopa. They tend to be more <b>expensive</b> <b>than</b> levodopa.|$|E
5|$|Gibbs used Swiss Pilatus P-2 army {{training}} planes {{standing in}} for Messerschmitt Bf-109s. He built a device {{based on an}} internal combustion engine to simulate gunfire, which was safer and less <b>expensive</b> <b>than</b> firing blanks. Baking soda was applied to Connery to create Henry's bullet wound. Vinegar was applied to create the foaming effect as {{the water from the}} Grail washes it away.|$|E
5|$|In many {{developing}} countries, the ketogenic diet is expensive because dairy fats and meat are more <b>expensive</b> <b>than</b> grain, fruit and vegetables. The modified Atkins diet {{has been proposed}} as a lower-cost alternative for those countries; the slightly more expensive food bill can be offset by a reduction in pharmaceutical costs if the diet is successful. The modified Atkins diet is less complex to explain and prepare and requires less support from a dietitian.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} the belt-drive {{turntable}} allows {{the use of a}} less <b>expensive</b> motor <b>than</b> the direct-drive turntable. Also, the elastomeric belt absorbs motor vibrations which would otherwise be picked up by the stylus.|$|R

50|$|Engineered {{hardwood}} has a thin {{solid wood}} layer on {{top with a}} composite core. It can be a less <b>expensive</b> option <b>than</b> buying hardwood, but it cannot be sanded and refinished. This flooring typically is installed with a click-lock method.|$|R
5|$|Neon gives a {{distinct}} reddish-orange glow {{when used in}} low-voltage neon glow lamps, high-voltage discharge tubes and neon advertising signs. The red emission line from neon also causes the well known red light of helium–neon lasers. Neon is used in some plasma tube and refrigerant applications but has few other commercial uses. It is commercially extracted by the fractional distillation of liquid air. Since air is the only source, it is considerably more <b>expensive</b> <b>than</b> helium.|$|E
5|$|Once reliant upon Germany for its ornaments, toys, {{and even}} its Christmas customs, America became {{self-sufficient}} in the post-War years with Christmas ornaments and toys being {{manufactured in the}} United States that were considerably less <b>expensive</b> <b>than</b> their German counterparts. American Christmas customs and traditions such as visits to department store Santas and letter writing to Santa at the North Pole remained intact during America's post-War years, but the era generated contributions that have endured to become traditions.|$|E
5|$|Sodium is now {{produced}} commercially {{through the}} electrolysis of molten sodium chloride, {{based on a}} process patented in 1924. This is done in a Downs cell in which the NaCl is mixed with calcium chloride to lower the melting point below 700°C. As calcium is less electropositive than sodium, no calcium will be deposited at the cathode. This method is less <b>expensive</b> <b>than</b> the previous Castner process (the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide).|$|E
50|$|Ithaka of the Clouds, a Lands of Dream text-based game. This {{game was}} {{originally}} crowdfunded, but Jonas decided to rename it The Council of Crows. Ithaka of the Clouds became {{a very different}} (and less <b>expensive)</b> game <b>than</b> Jonas had originally planned.|$|R

50|$|Crossings to {{destinations}} in North Africa take approximately 6 hours (normal ferry to Nador or Melilla). This is a {{much longer}} (and more <b>expensive)</b> crossing <b>than</b> the short crossings from Algeciras to Tangier, {{but it is more}} convenient for people traveling to the Rif area or Algeria.|$|R
5|$|The total costs, {{including}} all alterations, were £513,242 for Glatton and £777,197 for Gorgon, {{although there was}} no obvious reason for the disparity unless some of Glatton's costs had been charged against Gorgon as the lead ship of the class. A truer cost would be about £645,000 for each. This was almost double the original cost and made them more <b>expensive</b> <b>than</b> any of the other monitors.|$|E
5|$|The {{upgraded}} intersection {{had been}} a part of the City of Marquette's master plan since 2003. MDOT engineers touted the constant-flowing nature of the design as a benefit to the new intersection, and city planners promoted the enhanced safety aspects of the project. Both parties stated the planned intersection was less <b>expensive</b> <b>than</b> a conventional stop light.|$|E
5|$|Titanium alloys {{are used}} in {{spectacle}} frames that are rather expensive but highly durable, long lasting, light weight, and cause no skin allergies. Many backpackers use titanium equipment, including cookware, eating utensils, lanterns, and tent stakes. Though slightly more <b>expensive</b> <b>than</b> traditional steel or aluminium alternatives, titanium products can be significantly lighter without compromising strength. Titanium horseshoes are preferred to steel by farriers because it is lighter and more durable.|$|E

Ricardo was a [...] "Re-Action News" [...] anchor and {{reporter}} {{who had been}} known to focus more attention on the creases in his <b>expensive</b> trousers <b>than</b> the story he's been assigned to cover.|$|R
50|$|For example, many {{dark fibre}} {{metropolitan}} area networks use cheap Gigabit Ethernet equipment over CWDM, rather <b>than</b> <b>expensive</b> SONET ring systems.|$|R
25|$|Porous {{absorbers}} tend to {{be smaller}} in size and are easier to design and build as well as less <b>expensive</b> overall <b>than</b> resonant absorbers. However, the deep bass attenuation of a porous absorber is generally inferior, so its usefulness for attenuating lower frequency room resonances is more limited.|$|R
