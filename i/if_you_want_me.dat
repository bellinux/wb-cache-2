It's kinda awkward to be famous for a name that you've never been called before in your life. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to know that you don't know me, call me T.I. It's the weirdest most awkward thing." [...] During the interview he also spoke on the benefit of not having to deal with a major label and how he couldn't have released Da' Nic if he wasn't independent.|$|E

Sullivan did his part to facilitate the financial success of the young couple by granting Wright a five-year employment contract. Wright made one more request: [...] "Mr. Sullivan, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> {{to work for you}} as long as five years, couldn't you lend me enough money to build a little house?"

The existing Gothic Revival house was given to his mother, while a compact Shingle style house was built alongside for Wright and Catherine.|$|E
2500|$|Hung {{entered her}} first Legislative Election {{campaign}} in 1989. Her KMT branch director objected to her request, and therefore {{did not give}} her time off during the campaign. Hung insisted on entering the primary and was only {{able to participate in}} the events on weekends as a candidate. She had her cousin go to the events on weekdays and hold up her poster whenever her name was called as a silent protest of her helpless absence. This was widely reported by the media and Hung won the primary by marginal votes, and thus was nominated by the party. Hung said, [...] "My father passed away the moment when I won the primary. It seemed that he was waiting for the final confirmation. I was whispering in his ear, 'Bless me with the nomination <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to embark on my career in this path of politics.'" [...] Hung subsequently won the seat in the legislative election and began her career in the Legislative Yuan for eight consecutive terms.|$|E
