He says that all ships must remain at sea to ensure that humanity survives. The message is actually taken from a movie in the Simpson cabin's <b>DVD</b> <b>library,</b> set up by Bart to broadcast all over the ship. He also disables communications with the mainland by pouring hot fudge on a control panel. As the ship stays at sea, conditions deteriorate and the food supply starts to run out. Eventually, the cruise turns into a post-apocalyptic civilization, with gladiator arenas, marauders, capital punishment, and Priddis claiming kingship over the passengers.|$|E

40|$|Commercial {{tools and}} some recent work {{have done a}} great job in {{redundant}} via insertion. However, they are found with limited capability of inserting more vias (called via 1) between metal 1 and metal 2. Such a limitation is caused by the way the standard cells are designed. In this paper we propose a standard cell design methodology to facilitate via 1 s insertion. We design two cell <b>libraries</b> <b>DV</b> 1 and DV 2. DV 1 provides each pin with sufficient metal 1 area for holding two vias. DV 2 preinstalls two via 1 s directly at each pin. Compared to the results obtained using a commercial cell <b>library,</b> <b>DV</b> 1 achieves up to 23 % reduction in widowed vias (a via not accompanied by a redundant via), up to 15 % reduction in widowed via 1 s, and 2 %~ 6 % reduction in total via count. DV 2 achieves 56 %~ 84 % reduction in widowed vias and 94 %~ 99 % reduction in widowed via 1 s, but at the expense of 16 %~ 26 % increase in total via count. We achieve the above results (almost) at no extra cost in total cell area and wire length. 1...|$|R

5000|$|All three judges concurred, with Judge Rushing {{offering}} a separate opinion that addressed {{a bit more}} {{in the realm of}} fair use. Judge Rushing stated, [...] "In my view, its product was clearly not designed or intended to facilitate the theft of intellectual property; nobody buys it for that purpose; and if it has that incidental effect, it is no worse in most respects--and better in others--than an ordinary personal computer with freely available DVD-copying software." [...] He further commented that, [...] "The disk-in-machine clause is at most a contract term. It is not a moral imperative," [...] referencing the concern that such a system would enable a user to build an entire <b>DVD</b> <b>library</b> by merely copying rented or borrowed DVDs.|$|E

5000|$|In 2000, Giustra {{left the}} firm and it {{was taken over by}} Jon Feltheimer and Tom Ortenberg.

The two most notable acquisitions were Trimark Holdings (650 titles) in 2000 and Artisan Entertainment in 2003. The Trimark purchase also included CinemaNow, a broadband streaming website, where Lionsgate could feature its own movies. [...] These two along with other firms gave Lions Gate the second largest <b>DVD</b> <b>library</b> of any company, which includes Total Recall, Reservoir Dogs, On Golden Pond, Young Guns, Dirty Dancing and It's a Wonderful Life, in some cases via output deals with StudioCanal, ITC/Carlton, and Republic Pictures (the result of prior licensing deals with Lions Gate's home video predecessor Artisan).|$|E
50|$|Due to Lincoln's {{small numbers}} and tightly knit community, its Junior Common Room (JCR) plays {{a greater role}} in student life than do the JCRs of most other colleges. JCR elections, held in Trinity and Michaelmas Terms, attract one of the highest {{turnouts}} of any Oxford college. The JCR, like all JCRs in Oxford, is both a communal room for undergraduates (with a television, kitchen, vending machine, daily newspapers, a <b>DVD</b> <b>library</b> and sofas) as well as the name of the body that represents said undergraduates to the senior members of College and on a university-wide basis. All undergraduate members of the College are automatically members of the JCR, unless they specifically express a desire not {{to be a part of}} it. Honorary membership to others is sometimes extended, but have limited rights compared to other members. Every year, Lincoln JCR collaborates with the JCRs of the other Turl Street Colleges (Exeter and Jesus) in holding the Turl Street Arts Festival, a week long event consisting of music, plays, comedy nights, hall-swaps, and special talks.|$|E

40|$|A Digital virtual Disk (DVD) {{random access}} memory (RAM) Redundant Array of Inexpensive Libraries (RAIL) optical storage system has been {{developed}} and tested at NTT Integrated Information & Energy Systems Laboratories. The RAIL storage system incorporates multiple DVD libraries that consist of dual DVD-RAM drives. Each <b>DVD</b> <b>library</b> utilizes a single mechanical robot picker for media loading and unloading. The current capacity of the single sided and single layered DVD optical media used in that system is 2. 6 gigabytes. To increase the reliability of stored data {{and at the same}} time to eliminate the need for read after write verification, a process that can double the recording time, a RAID 4 algorithm has been implemented in the control unit of the RAIL storage system. Data sent by the host are transferred to a control unit, that stripes data over five data groups plus one parity unit. The striped and parity data are sent to individual libraries and written to DVD media. This system writes and retrieves storage data with a transfer rate of approximate 6 MB/sec, using write and read control methods that minimize data striping overhead. Other performance factors that affect the transfer rates are the striping size and the number of drives used in the RAIL system. Experimental results indicate that stripe sizes of 32 to 64 KB are sufficient to achieve high throughput. In addition, the transfer rates showed no further increase when the number of drives exceeded eight. This RAIL optical storage system which offers data redundancy can be used for networked multimedia applications...|$|E
