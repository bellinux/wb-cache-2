40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impacts of <b>intercultural</b> <b>experience</b> through English as a lingua franca (ELF) on {{language}} attitudes, with the focus on Chinese speakers’ narratives of ELF experience {{in relation to their}} views of Englishes. The data retrieved through the interviews with 35 Chinese users of English demonstrated the influences of ELF-medium <b>intercultural</b> <b>experience</b> on the participants’ attitudes in four aspects. First, the lack of ELF experience seems to maintain the myth of intelligibility associated with native-English monolingualism; second, ELF experience motivates the question to a monolithic view on English; third, ELF experience raises challenges concerning the relevance of native English for successful intercultural communication; fourth, ELF experience helps to boost the participants’ awareness of accommodation, which promotes intelligibility. The close examination of how <b>intercultural</b> <b>experience</b> takes effect in the aforesaid aspects points to the participants’ major concern for intelligibility of different forms of English to which ELF experience seems to be a remedy. In light of these, this paper discusses the issue of intelligibility and the role of <b>intercultural</b> <b>experience</b> in attitude formation, which leads to the exploration of pedagogical implications of this study.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of English {{as a global}} language {{has led to a}} huge demand for TESOL language educators around the world (Davies, 2009). This has resulted in greater intercultural encounters with the cultural Other; hence, the need to understand the experiences of these teachers to prepare teachers for their work and support them to achieve favourable outcomes of intercultural learning emerges. This is especially important in light of the failure of teacher education programs to prepare these teachers for the realities of their work and in light of inadequacy of intercultural learning theories to theorize intercultural learning based on these teachers’ experiences. This thesis sought to explore TESOL teachers’ experiences using a grounded approach that is based on the teachers’ experiences as central to their intercultural learning. Drawing upon the <b>intercultural</b> <b>experiences</b> of seven global TESOL teachers who are working in Saudi Arabia, this thesis sought to understand the types of <b>intercultural</b> <b>experiences</b> that they went through, the factors that affected these experiences and the intercultural learning that these experiences generated. Interpretative qualitative study methodology was employed in my study to examine the TESOL global teachers’ lived <b>intercultural</b> <b>experiences</b> in Saudi Arabia. Qualitative data were collected through conducting in-depth narrative interviews and examining personal correspondence (where available), with seven experienced global TESOL teachers. The findings suggested that the global TESOL educators’ <b>intercultural</b> <b>experiences</b> were enormously complex with many factors and four facets affecting these experiences. The global TESOL educators’ experiences of interculturality were mainly found to be Othering experiences. The factors related to the global educators’ social positions and the four facets were wider discourses, dispositional positions, contextual realities and situated value systems in Saudi Arabia. The findings highlighted the importance of “translocational positionalities” in understanding the TESOL global teachers’ <b>intercultural</b> <b>experiences</b> and learning. Contrary to the literature, the thesis suggests that intercultural learning was not about intercultural competencies and developmental stages, but about how the participants negotiated their positionalities and developed awareness of their positionalities in relation to the Other. The thesis also uncovered two insights that have potential to contribute to preparing and supporting global TESOL educators in global contact zones. These insights related to the educators’ need to talk about their <b>intercultural</b> <b>experiences</b> and the need to interrogate these educators’ understanding of culture. The findings and the insights offer some theoretical and practical implications for understanding intercultural learning experiences in a new light. The theoretical implications suggest a new experiential model for intercultural learning in global contact zones. The practical implications highlight suggestions for a pedagogy of dialogue for teacher education programmes to promote favourable intercultural learning outcomes...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} significance of context in university students’ experiences of intercultural interactions on- and off-campus, and attitudes towards culturally mixed learning activities. An original aspect is {{the adoption of a}} multi-layered and multiple context approach grounded in a “person-in-context” perspective (Volet, 2001; Pintrich, 2000). Inspired by central tenets from ecological psychology and activity theory, the research furthermore acknowledges the interdependence between individuals and their environment (e. g., Gibson, 1979 / 1986; Greeno, 1998). It construes individuals as located within multiple activity systems (Engeström, 2001) between which they move and participate, and which co-shape their intercultural interactions and attitudes. The empirical component of the research emerged from the overwhelming evidence of minimal interactions and poor attitudes towards mixing between culturally diverse peers at universities in English-speaking countries. A review of the extant literature, however, revealed major limitations in the research designs and methodologies. Investigations of students’ <b>intercultural</b> <b>experiences</b> and perceptions of culturally mixed group learning activities typically used only one sample from a single context, a single point of data collection, and self-report data, either a questionnaire or interview. On the assumption that students participate simultaneously in multiple social contexts, it was argued that such methodologies have limited potential to reveal the complex, interdependent, and contextsensitive nature of <b>intercultural</b> <b>experiences</b> and attitudes. A particular aim of the present research was to address the lack of systematic investigations of the social context to explain paucity of intercultural interactions and poor attitudes to mixing on multicultural campuses. This implied conceptualising <b>intercultural</b> <b>experiences</b> and interactions as multi-dimensional and contextualised, adopting multi-layered and multiple context research designs, and carrying out empirical studies that combined quantitative methodologies for the identification of meaningful patterns, and qualitative methodologies for gaining experiential insight into these complex, social phenomena. The findings revealed significant and powerful contextual affordances and constraints at multiple levels of the immediate (learning) environment for students’ experiences of culturally diverse group work and interactions. Contingent to a combination of contextual elements, students’ <b>intercultural</b> <b>experiences</b> were perceived and emerged differently within and across distinct social contexts. More specifically, cohort characteristics, language competency and level of academic standard were identified as salient facilitating or inhibiting factors for positive peer interactions and group management. One unexpected finding was that the culturally similar and close peer group seemed to represent an important social context that played a vital role in students’ openness and willingness to engage in interactions with peers from different backgrounds. The emotional risk of peer group disapproval when stepping out of the in-group to interact with ‘others’ was linked to fear of jeopardizing existing group memberships. These issues have been overlooked in prior research on intercultural interactions and have potential for contributing {{to a better understanding of}} the multi-faceted and interdependent nature of intercultural activities. The research concludes by stressing the crucial role of the social context in co-shaping students’ <b>intercultural</b> <b>experiences,</b> and development of cognitions and attitudes. It is argued that the identification of patterns in students’ attitudes and experiences of interactions with peers from different cultural-educational backgrounds has to be interpreted in relation to the immediate, social environment, and the specific contextual affordances and constraints within which interactions occur. In that regard, stable and narrow conceptualisations of the construct of intercultural interactions appear incompatible with the complex, interdependent and situation-specific nature of students’ intercultural activities on multicultural campuses...|$|E

40|$|Connecting intercultural {{research}} with Grounded Theory was advocated {{in the early}} history of intercultural theorising and includes the development of researchers' intercultural competencies. Such competency comes to the fore where intercultural theory places an equal emphasis on home and host cultures in migration research.

Grounded Theory allows for the exploration of various theories in different fields and the emergence of new or deeper interpretations of <b>intercultural</b> <b>experiences,</b> including where research has not engaged deeply with or avoided intercultural contexts. The use of software, based on Grounded Theory, provides the resource for systematically exploring the inter-related nature of data.

40|$|The {{paucity of}} intercultural {{interactions}} among students from culturally diverse backgrounds at university and off campus is widely {{documented in the}} literature. A review of this empirical work, however, reveals narrow conceptualisations of the construct of intercultural interactions. Intercultural interactions are seldom conceptualised as part of complex, dynamic activity systems, and across multiple social contexts. Yet, intercultural interactions represent unique relational, socio-emotional and socio-cultural activities with their own, specific underlying cognitive, motivational and emotional dynamics. It is posited that activity theory (e. g. Engeström in Journal of Education and Work 14 (1) : 133 – 156, 2001) provides a useful framework for interpreting students’ <b>intercultural</b> <b>experiences,</b> because of its emphasis on the evolving and complex interrelations between individuals and their surroundings—conceptualised as activity systems. The multiple contexts angle further stresses the overlapping and/or embedded nature of the activity systems that individuals simultaneously participate in. A series of empirical studies that incorporated quantitative methodologies for identifying meaningful patterns, and qualitative methodologies for gaining experiential insights into students’ <b>intercultural</b> <b>experiences</b> across multiple social contexts (i. e. formal on campus and informal, off campus) is presented. Methodological and conceptual issues related to studying the dynamics of motivational, cognitive and emotional aspects of intercultural interactions in activity systems and multiple contexts are addressed...|$|E

International Students' Intercultural Experiences: a Comparative Study, 2006 - 2008 sought to investigate the nature of undergraduate international students' <b>intercultural</b> <b>experiences</b> during their study in UK higher education. The research examines {{the similarities and differences}} {{in the way in which}} a sample of students adapt (or did not adapt) during their studying experience. A range of personal, pedagogical and situational factors were investigated. The data collection available from the UK Data Archieve combines quantitative and qualitative methodologies. The quantitative data collection involved a two wave questionnaire survey administrated to first-year undergraduates at four UK universities. The first wave examined patterns in student's initial adaptation and the second wave returned to the same students two years on and continued to explore the same themes. The qualitative data collection involved selecting eleven students from the original sample to be case studies. The students selected were from different countries and studying different disciplines. They were interviewed approximately four times over a fifteen-month period to explore their experiences while studying in the UK.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impacts of <b>intercultural</b> <b>experience</b> through English as a lingua franca (ELF) on {{language}} attitudes, with the focus on Chinese Speakers’ narratives of ELF experience {{in relation to their}} views of Englishes. The data retrieved through 769 questionnaires and 35 interviews with Chinese users of English revealed the impacts in four aspects. First, the lack of ELF experience helps to maintain the assumption that conformity to native English is necessary for interactants to understand each other. Second, ELF experience triggers the question about the exclusive connection between nativeness and intelligibility. Third, it raises challenges to the exclusive relevance of native English for successful intercultural communication. Fourth, it helps to develop an awareness of intercultural communication strategies as important for communicative effectiveness {{in the context of the}} diversity of English. Attitudes revealed in the four aspects all point to a concern with the issue what is intelligible English.

40|$|Within {{concepts}} on intercultural {{language learning}} {{it is generally}} acknowledged that the ‘context’ of the individual learning experience {{plays an important role}} for the acquisition of a foreign language and intercultural learning processes. A detailed understanding of what it is we call ‘context’ is still missing – as are studies that focus particularly on the language learning environment outside the classroom and the role of everyday space and place for intercultural encounter. This thesis draws largely on spatial theory in addressing space and place as a site of geo-political and social-cultural change, and as a crucial element of intercultural language learning processes. Narratives, de Certeau (1984 : 116) says, are “written by footsteps. ” The methodological orientation of this thesis follows both the narratives and footsteps of language learners, and as such is anchored in and around the element of movement. In creating a spatial ‘method assemblage’ (Law 2004) that engages both mobile and visual elements, I am arguing for a methodological change in perspective while giving credit to the perspective of language learners and their everyday routes and learning environments. This argument correlates with the particular methodological tool of ‘guided walks’, in which researcher and language learner walk together on daily routes within places of significance. Giving walking a central methodological and analytic role within this thesis underlines those moments of <b>intercultural</b> <b>experience,</b> which are based on movement, transformation and the search for the ephemeral. The particular understanding of intercultural language learning as a ‘spatial-embodied practice’ emerges from an ethnographic study as well as from a detailed examination of the ‘intercultural field’. The various imbalances of the ‘intercultural field’ effect intercultural language learning through the body, as well as the senses and practices of diversity, and re-shape an awareness of space. Not only increased physical mobility, but the complex networks of flows and transnational interrelations, increasingly transform <b>intercultural</b> <b>experience.</b> From this perspective, this thesis argues that language learners weave their <b>intercultural</b> <b>experience</b> through practices of ‘place making’ (Ingold 2011), and by moving in between myriad borders and boundaries...|$|R
