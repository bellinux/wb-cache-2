5|$|The {{entire day}} of a Jain monk is spent <b>in</b> <b>ensuring</b> <b>that</b> he observes his vow of ahimsa through mind, body and speech faultlessly. This {{seemingly}} extreme behaviour of the monks comes from a sense that every action, no matter however subtle, has a karmic effect which can bind soul and inhibit liberation, especially those that result in hiṃsā (injury).|$|E
5|$|At the time, several princes {{complained that}} they were being betrayed by Britain, who they {{regarded}} as an ally, and Sir Conrad Corfield resigned his position as head of the Political Department in protest at Mountbatten's policies. Mountbatten's policies were also criticised by the opposition Conservative Party. Winston Churchill compared the language used by the Indian government with that used by Adolf Hitler before the invasion of Austria. Modern historians such as Lumby and Moore, however, take the view that Mountbatten played a crucial role <b>in</b> <b>ensuring</b> <b>that</b> the princely states agreed to accede to India.|$|E

The option of brachytherapy may be particularly important <b>in</b> <b>ensuring</b> <b>that</b> working women, the elderly or women without easy access to a treatment centre, are able to benefit from breast-conserving therapy due to the short treatment course compared with WBI (which often requires more visits over the course of 1–2 months).|$|E
5|$|As Article 39A of the Constitution states, the GRC scheme entrenches the {{presence}} of minority MPs in Parliament, ensuring that interests of minority communities are represented in Parliament. Article 39A(1)(a) of the Constitution allows for a maximum number of six MPs for each GRC so as to provide flexibility <b>in</b> <b>ensuring</b> <b>that</b> a GRC with a rapidly expanding population is properly managed. As the population of a constituency grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for an MP to singlehandedly represent all his or her constituents' views. A team of MPs arguably has greater access to more constituents, {{and the fact that}} there are different MPs in the team suggests they can more effectively provide representation in Parliament of a wide range of constituents' views.|$|E
5|$|Following the McIntosh-Prescott Report, which {{indicated}} the long-term faults {{with the class}} that still required solving, successful {{efforts were made to}} bring the submarines to operational standard. As part of this, a public relations plan was implemented to provide up-to-date information on the submarines to the media, to improve the public perception of the class by providing factual information on the status of the project and responding to queries and incidents. This same period saw the dispelling of the idea, widely held within the RAN, that the Collins-class boats would be like any other vessel previously ordered by the RAN: in service with another navy, well tested, and with all the problems solved before they entered Australian hands. The RAN began to realise that as the parent navy for the class, they had a greater responsibility than normal <b>in</b> <b>ensuring</b> <b>that</b> the boats were at an operational standard.|$|E

5|$|In the Hanzhong community, {{everyone}} {{was regarded as}} ill in some way. This was because sin caused qi to leave the body, and qi was necessary for life. In order to cure any illness, repentance was a crucial factor <b>in</b> <b>ensuring</b> <b>that</b> the loss of qi could be staunched. Repentance could be accomplished by spending time in a 'Chamber of Silence,' and reflecting on one's sins, or by beating one's breasts and kowtowing to heaven. Illness could be cured in other ways as well, such as using medicinal herbs and by listening to ritual music. Eating very little was also of extreme importance, and an ideal diet would consist of no food at all, but only of noncorporeal things such as air, which the person could absorb through meditation.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, pre-production {{began again}} {{on a film}} with a treatment called Planet of the Titans and subsequent script produced by British writers Chris Bryant and Allan Scott {{with the intention of}} keeping costs down by filming in the United Kingdom.

Philip Kaufman was signed up to direct, after several others were asked first. The plot would have seen the crew investigating the homeworld of the mythical Titans, and in escaping through a black hole are hurled into the prehistoric past where they teach early man how to make fire.|$|E

The elections were to be carried out by the South African Administrator General, under UN supervision and control, and this Assembly would then draw up a constitution for an independent Namibia. UNTAG was tasked with assisting the SRSG <b>in</b> <b>ensuring</b> <b>that</b> all hostile acts ceased; South African troops were confined to base, and ultimately withdrawn; discriminatory laws were repealed, and political prisoners released; Namibian refugees were permitted to return (when they were known as returnees); intimidation was prevented, and law and order maintained.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{often used}} Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland—commonly known as Holinshed's Chronicles—as {{a source for}} his plays, and in Macbeth he borrows from several of the tales in that work. Holinshed portrays Banquo as a {{historical}} figure: he is an accomplice in Mac Bethad mac Findlaích's (Macbeth's) murder of Donnchad mac Crínáin (King Duncan) and plays an important part <b>in</b> <b>ensuring</b> <b>that</b> Macbeth, not Máel Coluim mac Donnchada (Malcolm), takes the throne in the coup that follows. Holinshed in turn used an earlier work, the Scotorum Historiae (1526–7) by Hector Boece, as his source. Boece's work is the first known record of Banquo and his son Fleance; and scholars such as David Bevington generally consider them fictional characters invented by Boece. In Shakespeare's day, however, they were considered historical figures of great repute, and the king, James I, based his claim to the throne in part on a descent from Banquo. The House of Stuart was descended from Walter fitz Alan, Steward of Scotland, and he was {{believed to have been}} the grandson of Fleance and Gruffydd ap Llywelyn's daughter, Nesta ferch Gruffydd. In reality Walter fitz Alan was the son of Alan fitz Flaad, a Breton knight.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of eukaryotic genes are stored {{on a set}} of large, linear chromosomes. The chromosomes are packed within the nucleus in complex with storage proteins called histones to form a unit called a nucleosome. DNA packaged and condensed in this way is called chromatin. The manner in which DNA is stored on the histones, as well as chemical modifications of the histone itself, regulate whether a particular region of DNA is accessible for gene expression. In addition to genes, eukaryotic chromosomes contain sequences involved <b>in</b> <b>ensuring</b> <b>that</b> the DNA is copied without degradation of end regions and sorted into daughter cells during cell division: replication origins, telomeres and the centromere. Replication origins are the sequence regions where DNA replication is initiated to make two copies of the chromosome. Telomeres are long stretches of repetitive sequence that cap the ends of the linear chromosomes and prevent degradation of coding and regulatory regions during DNA replication. The length of the telomeres decreases each time the genome is replicated and has been implicated in the aging process. The centromere is required for binding spindle fibres to separate sister chromatids into daughter cells during cell division.|$|E

5|$|Treloar's first {{challenge}} was {{to improve the quality}} of the war diaries kept by AIF units. These diaries were meant to be maintained by each element of the AIF as a record of its activities for later use by historians, but at the time most units recorded few details. To this end, Treloar met with many of the officers responsible for units' war diaries and frequently provided written advice and feedback on the quality of the records submitted to the Section; these methods had previously been used by the Canadian military. Treloar also sought to motivate relevant personnel by demonstrating that the diaries were valued and would be important <b>in</b> <b>ensuring</b> <b>that</b> their unit received recognition for its achievements after the war. In August 1917 the AWRS expanded its activities to include collecting artefacts from the French battlefields. Its tasks increased further in September when it took over responsibility for supervising the official war artists as well as producing and keeping records of non-official publications such as regimental magazines. Individual soldiers were encouraged to contribute artefacts and records, and the AWRS provided museum labels to combat units to encourage them to record the significance and origins of items they submitted. The AWRS established field offices in France and Egypt, and reached a strength of about 600 soldiers and civilians in November 1918. From November 1917 until August 1918 the war correspondent Henry Gullett commanded the AWRS subsection in Cairo; in this role he reported directly to Treloar. As a result of the AWRS' expansion, in March 1918 its headquarters moved from the PRO building to a larger office on Horseferry Road opposite the main offices of the AIF Administrative Headquarters.|$|E
