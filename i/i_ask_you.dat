Immediately after taking the oath of office in the East Room of the White House, he spoke to the assembled audience in a speech broadcast live to the nation. Ford noted the peculiarity of his position: [...] "I am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your president by your ballots, and so <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to confirm me as your president with your prayers."

His oldest brother, Greg, was 14 years Hoffman's senior and a mentor to his two younger brothers. [...] After Hoffman's first Little League game, Greg {{asked him how he}} did. Hoffman responded, [...] "I went 2-for-4, double, RBI." [...] to which Greg replied, [...] "That'll be the last (blanking) time you tell me how you did. When <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> how you did, it's how the team did." [...] Hoffman never forgot that. Given their age difference, Hoffman considered his brothers more role models than playmates. [...] " [...] was the guide while Greg was the drill instructor", said Hoffman.|$|E

[...] Epstein then supposedly said, [...] "Would you find it embarrassing if <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> {{to stay in a}} hotel overnight?"

There were reports of a brief sexual encounter between Lennon and Epstein during a four-day holiday in Barcelona, in April 1963. Lennon always denied the rumours, telling Playboy in 1980: [...] "Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated... but we did have a pretty intense relationship." [...] Lennon's first wife Cynthia also maintains that Lennon's relationship with Epstein was platonic. A fictionalised account of the Spanish holiday is featured in the 1991 film The Hours and Times.|$|E

The fourth and final tweet said the following: [...] "Close your accounts, don't risk your families the way I did, <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> all for forgiveness," [...] and included two photos of her. One of them showed her alive, and the second one showed her corpse splattered in blood. Twitter later deactivated the account but the photos had already leaked across social media.|$|E
