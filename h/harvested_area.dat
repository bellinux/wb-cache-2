50|$|An even-aged {{regeneration}} {{method that}} retains widely spaced residual trees {{in order to}} provide uniform seed dispersal across a <b>harvested</b> <b>area.</b> In the seed-tree method, 2-12 seed trees per acre (5-30/ha) are left standing in order to regenerate the forest. They will be retained until regeneration has become established at which point they may be removed. It may not always be economically viable or biologically desirable to re-enter the stand to remove the remaining seed trees. Seed-tree cuts can also be viewed as a clearcut with natural regeneration and can also have all of the problems associated with clearcutting. This method is most suited for light-seeded species and those not prone to windthrow.|$|E

50|$|The soil {{composition}} {{is affected by}} different deforestation processes of removing trees as it changes the soil productivity through compaction or removal. The soil holds {{more than just the}} nutrients and plants in the forests, it consists of inorganic material, organic matter, air, water and many micro and macro organisms. The act of deforestation requires the forest sector to build roads, which decrease the productive land base, to be able to access the trees which went down from 4.6% of the area harvest in mid-1990's to 3.5% in 2008. New stricter enforcement of laws regarding soil disturbance has dramatically reduced the degree of soil disturbances to the <b>harvested</b> <b>area</b> from 43 enforcement actions in 1995 to only 3 in 2008. Soil conservation is an important environmental issue to consider as it maintains water quality, ecosystem productivity and future economic benefits.|$|E

On October 27, 2010, the price of Azeri cotton reached its highest level in over 140 years, attributed to bad weather in other countries that led to a decrease in cotton harvesting elsewhere.According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the production of cotton in Azerbaijan owes much to child labor; and even though [...] "the number of child laborers involved in the production of cotton ... has considerably declined in the past decade", the 2014 TVPRA List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor issued by the Bureau of International Labor Affairs still classifies cotton as a good produced by child labor in Azerbaijan.|$|E
50|$|From 1967 to 1980, the Colombian economy, and {{particularly}} the coffee industry, experienced sustained growth. Because of severe weather problems affecting the world's largest exporter, Brazil, coffee prices reached unprecedented levels in the mid-1970s. High prices prompted an important expansion in coffee production in Colombia. This expansion involved {{a significant increase in}} the <b>harvested</b> <b>area</b> and, more importantly, the introduction of a high-yielding coffee variety. In just over a decade, Colombia's coffee production doubled. The expansion of production and exports boosted the income and purchasing capacity of the thousands of households involved in coffee cultivation, thereby increasing consumption rapidly and allowing the GDP to expand at an average annual rate of more than 5 percent during this period. Strong export earnings and a large increase in foreign-exchange reserves were the most noticeable results of this economic expansion. At the same time, the Bank of the Republic (Colombia's central bank) had to use a variety of policies and instruments at its disposal in order to prevent inflation from accelerating.|$|E

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{a quantitative}} {{analysis on the}} regional diversity of the Javanese farm agriculture and the pattern of its change which has taken place during the six decades in this century. The source material of this analysis is {{the two sets of}} five years average date (of the years 1916 - 20 and 1975 - 79) on the <b>harvested</b> <b>area</b> of seven major food crops in 65 regions covering the whole area of Java and Madura which have been derived from the official statistical documents and processed by the author. Major findings which have been acquired by this analysis are as follows: (1) The extension of the <b>harvested</b> <b>area</b> of seven crops during the six decades is very remarkable, and this is mainly caused by the increase of multiple cropping. (2) The percentage of the <b>harvested</b> <b>area</b> of rice to the total <b>harvested</b> <b>area</b> of seven crops is much higher {{in the western part of}} the island than its eastern part. On the contrary the percentage of the <b>harvested</b> <b>area</b> of maize is higher in the eastern part. (3) The pattern of extension of the farm agriculture is regionally different and sometimes contrastive. Generlly speaking, in West Java and the “East Hook” of East Java the agricultural development is highly wet rice oriented, while in many regions of the eastern half of Central Java and the western half of East Java the non-rice crops oriented development has taken place. (4) The share of the <b>harvested</b> <b>area</b> of soybean and peanuts has extended outstandingly. In case of soybean this tendency is particularly remarkable in East Java. (5) In West Java the agriculturally developing regions are not identical with the regions with big population increase, which means that the interregional exchange of agticultural products has increased within this part of island. On the contrary, the agricultural development in Central and East Java is much more oriented for the self supply of foods within each region. (6) When viewed as a support factor to the population increase, the non-rice crops production has been no less important than the rice production. (7) However, the agricultural development as a whole cannot be seen the sole factor supporting the population increase, because the regional correlation between the increase of <b>harvested</b> <b>area</b> of seven crops and the population increase is not prominently high (+ 0. 5040 for the whole Java) ...|$|E

These distributions {{were based on the}} assumption that stands with areas ≤ 1  ha would be treated as 1 -ha stands during harvesting. This was due to the results of a questionnaire survey, which demonstrated that the minimal viable <b>harvesting</b> <b>area</b> was 1  ha. As the average stand area was approximately 0.5  ha, this assumption was intended to determine how profitability would increase if multiple adjacent small stands were harvested simultaneously in order to lower costs.

This simulation showed that simultaneous harvesting of small plots could raise profitability by 186, 242 and 138 % at discount rates of 1, 3 and 5 %, respectively.|$|R
