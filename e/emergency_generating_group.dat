The study of growth rates of finitely <b>generated</b> <b>groups</b> goes back to 1950s and is motivated in part by the notion of volume entropy (that is, the growth rate of the volume of balls) in the universal covering space of a compact Riemannian manifold in differential geometry. It is obvious that the growth rate of a finitely <b>generated</b> <b>group</b> is at most exponential and it was also understood early on that finitely <b>generated</b> nilpotent <b>groups</b> have polynomial growth. In 1968 John Milnor posed a question about the existence of a finitely <b>generated</b> <b>group</b> of intermediate growth, that is, faster than any polynomial function and slower than any exponential function. An important result in the subject is Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth, obtained by Gromov in 1981, which shows that a finitely <b>generated</b> <b>group</b> has polynomial growth if and only if this group has a nilpotent subgroup of finite index. Prior to Grigorchuk's work, there were many results establishing growth dichotomy (that is, that the growth is always either polynomial or exponential) for various classes of finitely <b>generated</b> <b>groups,</b> such as linear groups, solvable groups, etc.|$|R

Roughly, this means that every finitely <b>generated</b> <b>group</b> can be {{constructed}} from finite and one-ended groups via a finite number of amalgamated free products and HNN extensions over finite subgroups.

40|$|Abstract. The conjugacy growth {{function}} of a finitely <b>generated</b> <b>group</b> measures the number of conjugacy classes in balls {{with respect to a}} word metric. We study the following natural question: Which functions can occur as conjugacy growth {{function of}} finitely <b>generated</b> <b>groups?</b> Our main result solves the question completely. Namely we prove that a function f: N → N can be realized (up to a natural equivalence) as the conjugacy growth {{function of a}} finitely <b>generated</b> <b>group</b> if and only if f is non-decreasing and bounded from above by an for some a ≥ 1. We also construct a finitely <b>generated</b> <b>group</b> G and a subgroup H ≤ G of index 2 such that H has only 2 conjugacy classes while the conjugacy growth of G is exponential. In particular, conjugacy growth is not a quasi-isometry invariant. 1...|$|R
40|$|Universality {{has been}} an {{important}} concept in computable structure theory. A class C of structures is universal if, informally, for any structure, of any kind, there is a structure in C with the same computability-theoretic properties as the given structure. Many classes such as graphs, groups, and fields are known to be universal. This paper is about the class of finitely <b>generated</b> <b>groups.</b> Because finitely <b>generated</b> structures are relatively simple, the class of finitely <b>generated</b> <b>groups</b> has no hope of being universal. We show that finitely <b>generated</b> <b>groups</b> are as universal as possible, given that they are finitely generated: for every finitely generated structure, there is a finitely <b>generated</b> <b>group</b> which has the same computability-theoretic properties. The same is not true for finitely generated fields. We apply the results of this investigation to quasi Scott sentences...|$|R
