5|$|Waterloo is {{the busiest}} railway {{station in the}} UK. It is also the country's largest station in terms of <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> and has the {{greatest}} number of platforms at 24. When combined with the Underground and Waterloo East stations, it is the busiest station complex in Europe.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} an {{important}} industrial area in western China, Chongqing is also rapidly urbanising. For instance, new construction added approximately 137,000 square meters (1.5 million square feet) daily of usable <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> to satisfy demands for residential, commercial and factory space. More than 1,300 people move into the city daily, bolstering the economy by approximately 100 million Yuan.|$|E
5|$|Coin-operated {{machines}} to vend food, for amusement, and for gambling became {{popular in the}} 1890s. Such machines could be placed on otherwise unused <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> in businesses, required little maintenance, and brought in money for owners. Beginning about 1898, coin-operated mechanical pianos also became popular. The Mills Novelty Company was a leading producer of such devices; by 1906 it was producing machines ranging from a mechanically played violin to fortune-telling devices. While some {{machines to}}ok cents or other denominations, the nickel was the coin of choice for these machines.|$|E
40|$|Effect of zeolites {{spreading}} on litters to broiler performances {{under different}} <b>floor</b> <b>spaces</b> had been performed in five weeks. As many as 324 chicks of a day-old Hubbard strain were fed rations contained 3, 000 – 3, 100 Kcal/Kg ME and 21 % crude protein during starter period and fed the ration contained 20 % crude protein with similar energy during finisher period. The chicks were randomly allocated to three different <b>floor</b> <b>spaces</b> (10, 12, and 14 heads/m 2) and three different zeolites spread-litters (0. 0, 2. 5, and 5. 0 kg zeolites/m 2) under completely randomized design with factor 3 x 3 and 3 replications. Parameters concerned of present research including feed intake, live weight gain, and mortality rate were analyzed with {{analysis of variance}} (ANOVA) and least significant different (LSD). Results of the present research showed {{that there was no}} interaction effect between <b>floor</b> <b>spaces</b> and zeolites spread litters on all parameters concerned. <b>Floor</b> <b>spaces</b> affected both feed intake (...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a two-dimensional {{model with a}} real size home composed of two-storey (ground and first <b>floor</b> <b>spaces)</b> separated by a slab, enveloped by a wall with rectangular section containing phase change material (PCM) {{in order to minimize}} energy consumption in the buildings. The main objective of the PCM-wall system is to decrease the temperature change from outdoor space before it reaches the indoor space during the daytime. The numerical approach uses effective heat capacity Ceff model with realistic outdoor climatic conditions of Tlemcen city, Algeria. The numerical results showed that by using PCM in wall as energy storage components may reduce the room temperature by about 6 to 7 °C of temperature depending on the floor level (first <b>floor</b> <b>spaces</b> or ground <b>floor</b> <b>spaces)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the spacing between {{adjacent}} building floors on the wind distribution and turbulence intensity was analysed using computational fluid dynamics in this study. Five computational models were created with <b>floor</b> <b>spacing</b> ranging from 0. 8 m (benchmark) to 1. 6 m. The three-dimensional Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes equations along with the momentum and continuity equations were solved using the FLUENT code for obtaining the velocity and pressure field. Simulating a reference wind speed of 5. 5 m/s, {{the findings from the}} study quantified that at a <b>floor</b> <b>spacing</b> of 1. 6 m, the overall wind speed augmentation was 39 % which was much higher than the benchmark model (<b>floor</b> <b>spacing</b> = 0. 8 m) indicating an amplification in wind speed of approximately 27 %. In addition, the results indicated a gradual reduction in turbulence kinetic energy by up to 53 % when the <b>floor</b> <b>spacing</b> was increased from 0. 8 to 1. 6 m. Although the concept was to integrate wind turbines into the building fabric, this study is limited to the assessment of the airflow inside the <b>spaces</b> of building <b>floors</b> which can be potentially harnessed by a vertical axis wind turbine. The findings of this work have indicated that there is a potential for integration which will lead on to future research in this area...|$|R
5|$|Following the {{investment}} in the project by the bank, the developers successfully sought modification of the original planning approval by the Perth City Council to allow {{the use of the}} Palace Hotel as a bank, rather than remaining as a public hotel. With this permission, construction of the development by Multiplex proceeded, and <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> was leased rapidly; by October 1985 only four floors of the building remained for lease and it was expected to be fully let before completion.|$|E
5|$|On February 2, 2011, the 1,000th 767 rolled out, {{destined for}} All Nippon Airways. The {{aircraft}} was the 91st 767-300ER {{ordered by the}} Japanese carrier, and with its completion the 767 became the second wide-body airliner to reach the thousand-unit milestone after the 747. The 1,000th aircraft also marked the last model produced on the original 767 assembly line. Beginning with the 1,001st aircraft, production moved to another area in the Everett factory which occupied {{about half of the}} previous <b>floor</b> <b>space.</b> The new assembly line made room for 787 production and aimed to boost manufacturing efficiency by over twenty percent.|$|E
5|$|One World Trade Center is principally {{owned by}} the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Around 5percent equity of the {{building}} was sold to the Durst Organization, a private real estate company, in exchange for an investment of at least $100million. The Durst Organization assisted in supervising the building's construction, and manages the building for the Port Authority, having responsibility for leasing, property management, and tenant installations. By September 2012, around 55percent of the building's <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> had been leased, but no new leases were signed for three years until May 2014; the amount of space leased had gone up to 62.8percent by November 2014.|$|E
50|$|The Odd Fellows chapter had {{membership}} of 125 men in 1895 when this building, with third <b>floor</b> lodge <b>space</b> for the chapter, was built.

5|$|Post Oak Mall is a {{regional}} shopping mall in College Station, Texas owned by CBL & Associates Properties. Construction {{on the mall}} began in summer 1979 and it opened February 17, 1982. It initially housed 80 stores with four anchors. A second phase, planned before the mall even opened, was completed in 1985, adding more <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> and bringing the mall up to 125 stores and 6 anchor stores. As of 2015, it also houses a small food court and two restaurants.|$|E
5|$|The {{library is}} {{designed}} {{with an eye}} toward late 19th century and early 20th century movements in architecture. While it contains many elements common to Classical Revival architecture the building's asymmetry and playfully creative style are distinctly characteristic of the Arts and Crafts Movement. The building was designed by the Chicago architectural firm of Pond and Pond and is constructed of buff colored brick. Red brick belt coursing and accents contrast the buff colored brick on the majority of the facade. The two-story Oregon Public Library has a full brick basement and approximately 5,500 foot² (511 m²) of <b>floor</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
5|$|The towers were {{designed}} as framed tube structures, giving tenants open floor plans, unobstructed by columns or walls. This design {{was accomplished by}} using many closely spaced perimeter columns, providing much of the structure's strength, with the gravity load shared with the core columns. The elevator system, which made use of sky lobbies and a system of express and local elevators, allowed substantial <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> {{to be used for}} office purposes by making the structural core smaller. The design and construction of the towers involved many other innovative techniques, such as wind tunnel experiments and the slurry wall for digging the foundation.|$|E
50|$|The Key Bank Building is a 253 ft (77m) tall {{skyscraper}} in Columbus, Ohio. It {{was completed}} in 1963 and has 20 floors. It is the 23rd tallest building in Columbus and has 24,619 m² of <b>floors</b> <b>space.</b>|$|R

50|$|The airport began {{construction}} of a roof over the parking deck in March 2015 to increase close-in, covered long-term parking. The roof covers most of the fourth <b>floor,</b> though some <b>spaces</b> on the fourth and third floors remain uncovered due to airfield sight-line requirements for the FAA control tower. The garage roof was completed in November 2015 and will allow use of the fourth <b>floor</b> <b>spaces</b> during heavy snow.|$|R
5|$|Until 1902 the Portland Public Library, {{which started}} as a reading room for sailors {{and then as a}} {{subscription}} library, was housed in the building. In 1928, the city began {{one of a series of}} renovations on the building to increase <b>floor</b> <b>space.</b> That year one of the two light wells were filled in, blocking off natural light to the lower floors. The city added a new elevator in 1931. The next remodel started in 1933, and lasted through 1937. During this construction the second light well was filled in for more space, and a penthouse apartment was built on top of the roof.|$|E
5|$|By the 1920s {{virtually}} all commercial shipping activity had ceased at the dock, although its warehouses did remain in {{use for the}} storage of goods transported by barge, road or rail. The onset of the Second World War in 1939 saw the Albert Dock being 'requisitioned' by the Admiralty and used as base for the British Atlantic fleet including submarines, small warships and landing craft. During the war the dock was struck on several occasions including a bombing raid in 1940 that damaged ships within it, and more destructively during the May Blitz of 1941 when German bombing caused extensive damage to the south west stack. By {{the end of the}} war almost 15% of the Albert Dock's <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> was out of use because of bomb damage.|$|E
5|$|Central Saint Giles {{provides}} 66,090m² of <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> – {{almost double}} that of the old St Giles Court – split between two separate buildings. The 15-storey west block is for residential use, providing 109 flats of which 53 are designated as affordable. The much larger horseshoe-shaped eastern block, standing 11 storeys high, encircles a publicly accessible courtyard comprising 27% of the site's area. It provides 37,625m² of office space with {{by far the largest}} floor plates of any office block in the West End of London, with 4,000m² on all but the top two floors. At ground level, 2,276m² of space is available for retail outlets and restaurants. The block is irregularly shaped with recesses, projections and roof terraces intended to make it look more interesting and to break up its bulk.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, {{the owners}} of One Times Square filed for {{bankruptcy}} protection. In March 1995, One Times Square was sold to the financial services firm Lehman Brothers for $27.5 million. The new owners felt {{that it would not}} be cost-effective to house new tenants in the tower due to the cost of the extensive renovation required in order to make it suitable for tenants as compared to the relatively small rental revenue that its limited <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> would have brought in. Instead, they decided to market the tower as a location for advertising to capitalize on its prominent location within the Square. The entire exterior of One Times Square above the ticker was modified to add a grid frame for mounting billboard signs.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Duxford {{announced}} plans for the redevelopment of Hangar 1, previously known as the 'Superhangar', which {{was built in the}} 1980s. The plans would expand the building by 40%, providing more display and conservation space, improve internal conditions, and enable the museum's British and Commonwealth aircraft collection to be brought under cover. Planning permission was received later that year. The project cost £25 million and was supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund, the East of England Development Agency and BAE Systems, which contributed £6 million. The building, which provides 12,000m2 of <b>floor</b> <b>space,</b> consists of an aircraft conservation area, a large exhibition hall, and a mezzanine providing views of the aircraft and interactive educational installations exploring aeronautical engineering and the principles of flight.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} most suburbs of the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, its economy is {{dominated}} by the economies of Newcastle–upon–Tyne and Gateshead town centre. This is reflected in terms of independent commercial space; retail <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> in the suburb totals 1% of that available in the whole metropolitan borough. There are 33 retail units concentrated on Old Durham Road, which provide some employment, though these are {{at the lower end of}} the spectrum and provide little choice. There is a good provision of hardware stores, fast–food outlets and hairdressers, a butcher's shop, a greengrocer and a supermarket, but there is no bakery, bank nor building society and the Post Office has closed. The retail units were domestic properties, so many are too small for retail purposes and around 20% are vacant.|$|E
50|$|Natural {{light is}} also {{a key element in}} the overall design concept. Clerestory light penetrates from the second <b>floor</b> <b>spaces</b> down to the first floor in the public corridors, {{educational}} wings, and classrooms. Glass walls in the classrooms not only allow for this access to natural light, but also visual access to all parts of the education wing.|$|R

5|$|In {{the final}} quarter of 2006, Shelbourne Development issued two {{separate}} press releases regarding the construction and design of the spire. A November 2006 press release stated that construction of the Chicago Spire would begin in June 2007. In early December 2006, Shelbourne Development issued another press release stating that {{the design of the}} building had been revised. This included the removal of the hotel and the antenna mast, making the building consist solely of condominium units. The design change altered the twist to be consolidated towards the base of the building, which was also wider than the original plan. Additionally, the spire no longer tapered at the top, resulting in an increase in <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> and overall floor count. The revision also removed the separate parking structure from the original plan, instead incorporating underground parking into the spire itself. This first major redesign of the Chicago Spire was criticized by architectural critics and city officials.|$|E
5|$|Kirkcaldy's town centre, {{which serves}} a large {{catchment}} area of around 130,000 residents within a 20-minute drive, {{is the largest}} in Fife in terms of retail <b>floor</b> <b>space.</b> Eligible businesses voted in favour of a BID (Business Improvement District) scheme for the town centre in 2010. The High Street, which runs parallel to the Esplanade, {{is home to the}} Mercat Shopping Centre and Postings Shopping Centre. A regeneration programme to upgrade the appearance of the High Street was completed in late 2011. A separate project has also created a 'green corridor' to link the main railway station and bus station with the High Street. The budget for the entire project was £4million, £2million of which was provided through the Scottish Government's Town Centre Regeneration Fund.|$|E
