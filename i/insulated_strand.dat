40|$|A {{method of}} {{manufacturing}} superconducting multi-pole coils fcr 40 to 50 kG DC beam line magnets with low current is described. We built small coils and tested them successfully to short sample characteris-tics. The coils did not train after the first cool-down. The coils are porous and well cocled to cope with mechanical instability and energy deposited in the coil from the beam particles. The coils are wound with <b>insulated</b> <b>strand</b> cable. The cable is shaped rectangularly for winding simpli-city and good tolerances. After the coil is wound, the insulated strands are electrically connected in series. This reduces the operating current and, most important, improves the coil quench propagation due to heat conduction of one strand adjacent to the other. A well distributed quench allows the magnet energy to distribute more uniformly to the copper in the super-conductor wire, giving self-protected coils. We are now fabricating a one-meter long, 43 kG, G-inch bore tube superconducting dipole. The porous coil design and coil winding methods are discussed...|$|E

The main features of the focusing lens have been described in the pre-release note [1]. Although the main features of the solenoid design did not change, certain adjustments introduced during fabrication of the lens with the embedded corrector windings resulted in certain changes in the solenoid performance. First, addition of correction winding required some reduction in {{the length of the}} coil to allocate sufficient space for the correctors ’ ends.

Finally, as in the case of the prototype # 1, the winding was not as straightforward as it was for the test coils, which used strand with 30 µm “single-build ” ML (mylar) coating. For this coil, our attempts to make a regular winding did not fully succeed: the outer layers were wound stochastically. This changed the main coi...|$|E

A significant difference was observed in the current redistribution among strands due to the different cabling designs. It has an important influence on the stability of multistrand cables.

50|$|Skin {{effect in}} audio cables is the {{tendency}} for high frequency signals to travel more on the surface than {{in the center of}} the conductor, as if the conductor were a hollow metal pipe. This tendency, caused by self-inductance, makes the cable more resistant at higher frequencies, diminishing its ability to transmit high frequencies with as much power as low frequencies. As cable conductors increase in diameter they have less overall resistance but increased skin effect. The choice of metals in the conductor makes a difference, too: silver has a greater skin effect than copper; aluminum has less effect. Skin effect is a significant problem at radio frequencies or over long distances such as miles and kilometers worth of high-tension electrical transmission lines, but not at audio frequencies carried over short distances measured in feet and meters. Speaker cables are normally made with stranded conductors but bare metal strands in contact with each other do not mitigate skin effect; the bundle of strands acts as one conductor at audio frequencies. Litz wire - individually <b>insulated</b> <b>strands</b> held in a particular pattern - is a type of high-end speaker wire intended to reduce skin effect. Another solution that has been tried is to plate the copper strands with silver which has less resistance.|$|R

However, {{it is necessary}} to enhance a current capacity for practical use. We proposed the configuration of parallel conductors and adopted it to several pieces of test transformers, e. g. a 66 kV- 2 MVA one for a power grid, 25 kV- 4 MVA one for a Shinkansen rolling stock, and so on. The constituent strands of parallel conductors need to be insulated and transposed for the sake of uniform current distribution and low ac loss. In case the transposition points deviate from the optimum ones, shielding current is induced according to the interlinkage magnetic flux of the twisted loop enclosed by the <b>insulated</b> <b>strands</b> and the contact resistances at the terminals. It produces an additional ac loss. Up to now, we have studied in the simple situation where parallel conductors are exposed to a uniform ac magnetic field. In this study, we studied the additional ac losses in the case that two-strand parallel conductors are located in non-uniform magnetic field. We derived theoretical expressions of the additional ac losses and discussed the dependences of them on the non-uniformity in magnetic field, the deviation length of the transposition point from the optimum one, and so on...|$|R

40|$|International audienceElectromagnetic Casting (EMC) and Magnetic Suspension Melt Processing (MSMP) {{are very}} {{important}} technologies in the metallurgical industry. They make use of an electromagnetic field for contactless heating, shaping and control of solidification of hot melts. Advantages of these techniques are high surface quality, high cleanness, low contamination and near-net shape manufacturing. The ECM has primarily been employed for containerless continuous casting but is mainly used to prepare ingots of aluminum alloy. Another important application, extensively used in aeronautics, astronautics, energy and chemical engineering, is in the manufacturing of components of engines made of superalloy materials (Ni,Ti, [...] .). These technologies {{are based on the}} repulsive forces that an alternating electromagnetic field produces on the surface of this kind of materials. This electromagnetic field is induced by an externally imposed alternating current. Under suitable assumptions, the mathematical model is described by a set of equations expressing an equilibrium relation on the boundary between electromagnetic pressures and surface tensions, as well as gravity forces in the three-dimensional problem. The boundary shape of the liquid metal such that the equilibrium is attained can be found as the solution of a nonlinear free surface problem. In this work we study the electromagnetic shaping of a vertically falling molten metal column with a magnetic field induced by a set of vertical electric wires. In the direct problem the position and shape of the inductors are given and the magnetic field created by them produces a surface pressure on the vertical column of liquid metal to change its shape until an equilibrium relation on the boundary between the electromagnetic pressures and surface tensions is satisfied. The numerical method to solve the direct problem is based on an energetic variational formulation for the equilibrium. The inverse problem consists of locating the inductors in order to have an horizontal cross-section of the molten metal {{as close as possible to}} a prescribed shape. In this work we consider a realistic case where each inductor is a set of bundled <b>insulated</b> <b>strands.</b> In this case we represent inductors by a set of domains in the plane. The electric current density is assumed uniform on the entire cross-section of the inductor. This is a very reasonable approximation for the case where the inductors are made up of multiple individually <b>insulated</b> <b>strands</b> twisted or woven together. In order to design suitable inductors using numerical methods two different approaches are proposed, the first one looks for a set of inductors such that the distance between the computed shape and the given target one is minimized. In the second approach the error of the equilibrium equation for the target shape is minimized. In this last formulation only shape variables concerning the inductors are considered. This fact allows us to solve the inverse problem with a minor computational effort. In order to develop a numerical method we consider a Simultaneous Analysis and Design optimization technics, SAND, which is a formulation that includes the state variables as unknowns of the mathematical program and the state equations as equality constraints. In this work we employ a SAND formulation to solve the inverse problem for both approaches. The finite dimensional optimization problem obtained after discretization was solved employing the Feasible Arc Interior Point Algorithm, FAIPA, a line search interior-point algorithm for nonlinear optimization. Numerical computations for several examples of the direct and inverse problems are presented to show the efficacy of the proposed formulations in the design of suitable inductors...|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies have}} used cable-in-conduit {{conductor}} (CICC) coils {{in trying to}} develop an AC superconducting magnet because of its enormous potential if AC losses were low and insulation voltage was high. The strands {{in the most recent}} CICC magnets are coated with chromium or another metal with high electrical resistance to order to induce current re-distribution among the strands and to avoid a quench caused by a current imbalance. Current re-distribution is highly complex and very difficult to analyze because the conditions of the strand surfaces and the contact areas vary greatly with the operation of the conductor. If, however, the cable currents were well-balanced, <b>insulating</b> the <b>strands</b> would {{be the best way to}} reduce AC losses.

Each <b>strand</b> is individually <b>insulated,</b> and the <b>strands</b> are arranged so that at certain points in the winding, or throughout the whole winding, each portion occupies different relative positions in the complete conductor. The transposition equalizes the current flowing in each strand of the conductor, and reduces eddy current losses in the winding itself.

40|$|Unexpected {{ramp rate}} {{limitations}} (RRL) found in superconducting magnets {{during the development}} of magnet systems {{can be attributed to}} a current imbalance amongst the cabled strands which leads to a lower than expected quench current. In superconducting magnets the current distribution in the cable during ramping depends mainly on the electromagnetic properties of the system. A detailed analysis of principle causes for RRL phenomena was performed with a model for one half of the POLO coil considering the complete inductance matrix of the cable and the fact that all turns are mutually coupled. The main results of these calculations are that unequal contact resistances can not be responsible for RRL phenomena in coils with parameters comparable to those of the POLO coil and that already minor geometrical disturbances in the cable structure can lead to major and lasting imbalances in the current distribution of cables with <b>insulated</b> and non-insulated <b>strands.</b> During the POLO experiment the half-coil model was employed to get {{a better understanding of the}} measured compensated subcable voltages during quench.

40|$|Large-scale {{generators}} tend to {{have high}} power. Normally, the armature winding of these generators consist of multiple <b>strands</b> <b>insulated</b> separately and transposed (using Roebel transposition) in order to suppress losses caused by eddy currents and circulating currents. As the generator reaches high power density, circulating currents in the armature winding are large, and hence the loss must be estimated accurately in generator design. Calculation of such losses requires the distribution of circulating currents, which differs from strand to strand. The Roebel bar optimum structure allows increasing machine efficiency, and consequently energy savings. In this thesis, the circulating currents in a Roebel transposed diamond coil have been studied. The Roebel transposition in the active part of the generator have been 180 ° and 360 °. Moreover the circulating currents for a traditional Roebel bar (no transposition at the end region) and for a Roebel bar with transposition at the end region {{has been carried out}}. Finally the values of circulating currents and the losses due to these currents for these Roebel bars have been compared. The study has been carried out using models of the winding developed in a FEM-program package. A 2 D model of the active part has been drawn in MagNet. From the flux linkages that are taken from the program the circulating currents has been calculated analytically. A 3 D model of the end region of the winding has been drawn in MagNet and the fields of this region has been studied. The circulating currents in half a coil has been investigated from the results obtained from the 2 D and 3 D simulations. The conclusions of the study are that using 360  transposition in the active part reduces the circulating currents almost to zero. 180  transposition reduces the circulating current. The study further concludes that using transposition in the end region reduces the circulating currents in the bar. Finally the study concludes that the minimum circulating current loss is achieved in case of 360  transposition in the active part (slot region) and transposition in the end region. It is also shown a cost-effective well chosen manufacturing process...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} study of large-current capacity High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) conductors suitable for fusion reactor magnets {{has been carried}} out in this thesis. 　　　Presently, well-established low-temperature superconductors (LTS), such as NbTi and Nb 3 Sn, operating at ～ 4 K are being used for producing high magnetic fields in fusion devices like Tore-Supra, LHD, EAST, SST- 1, KSTAR, W 7 -X and are being planned to be used in near future machines such as JT- 60 SA and ITER. However, the LTS conductors are prone to quench due to the lower specific heats of the materials and therefore lower stability margin at 4 K. The stability margin of LTS conductors further degrades due to non-uniform current distribution among strands, such as observed in Demo Poloidal Coils (DPC). The future fusion energy reactors such as LHD-type force- free helical reactor (FFHR) cannot allow their huge magnets to quench and therefore {{there is a need to}} develop high stability conductors to have safer operations. Compared to LTS, HTS possess rather higher stability as they can be operated at elevated temperatures above 20 K, which assures higher specific heats and therefore lower risk of quench. In addition to high stability, high critical current density is expected for HTS materials in high magnetic fields even at elevated temperatures. Moreover, lower refrigeration power is required due to elevated temperature operations. 　　　Owing to the above-mentioned advantages, HTS conductors are considered to be a potential candidate for future fusion energy reactor magnets. However, HTS conductors are presently available only in the wire and tape forms and no large-current (> 10 kA) capacity HTS conductor that can be used for magnet windings (not for current-leads) has been developed yet. Toward the development of large-current capacity HTS conductors, feasibility of large-current capacity HTS conductors suitable for fusion energy reactors is studied in this thesis. We hereby make a new proposal of simple stacking of HTS wires in the conductor form and the focus of this research is on the cryogenic stability of this type of conductors. Due to simple stacking of HTS wires, it is probable to observe inductance mismatching among HTS wires and therefore non-uniform current distribution is supposed to be formed in the conductor. As mentioned above, non-uniform current distribution is a serious problem for LTS conductors especially with <b>insulated</b> <b>strands.</b> Even though we are proposing HTS conductors, suitable for DC magnets, without insulation between wires to assure good current re-distribution, it is considered to be an important task to investigate the effect of non-uniform current distribution on the conductor stability. In this respect, as the artificial introduction of non-uniform current distribution is rather easy in cable-in-conduit conductors (CICC), the present research was initiated by critically examining the stability of the non-insulated strand LTS CICC with non-uniform current distribution in the conductor. Secondly, we developed a method to examine the effect of non-uniform current distribution on HTS conductors rather directly by utilizing the LTS/HTS hybrid conductor concept. Thirdly, we fabricated 10 kA-class HTS conductors and tested them extensively. Finally, we carried out the HTS conductor design study for the helical coils of FFHR. 　　　We carried out stability margin measurement experiments on a fu 11 -scale CICC with non-insulated NbTi/Cu strands by artificially introducing non-uniform current distribution in a controlled way. In our experiments, we found that the stability margin of the conductor reduced significantly due to the non-uniform current distribution, which indicates that non-uniform current distribution is a problem even for non-insulated strand conductors where current re-distrilbution can take place rather easily. We found that with the non-uniform current distribution, the stability margin reduced by more than one order of magnitude, especially in the transition region between the well-cooled and ill-cooled regions. The limiting current, which separates the well-cooled and ill-cooled regions, was found to be shifted toward lower current values due to non-uniform current distribution in the conductor. We have carried out numerical calculations to simulate the experimental data of stability margin with uniform and non-uniform current distributions and found good consistency between experimental and calculated results. 　　　We carried out ramp rate limitation (RRL) experiments as well and found that the quench current reduced due to non-uniform current distribution for faster ramp rates ranging from 100 A/s to 800 A/s. Hence, our experiments of stability margin measurements with non-uniform current distribution on non-insulated strand CICC clearly suggest that non-uniform current distribution is an important factor to be considered for large-current capacity LTS conductors. Therefore, the effect of non-uniform current distribution on the stability of HTS conductors should also be examined even though the stability of HTS conductors is supposed to be quite high compared to LTS conductors. 　　　Then, we proposed a unique and innovative experimental method to examine the effect of non-uniform current distribution on the stability of HTS conductors. We prepared an LTS/HTS hybrid conductor, which was the world 2 ̆ 7 s first superconducting conductor using both LTS and HTS together. In a hybrid conductor, layers of Bi- 2223 /Ag HTS tapes were soldered to form a stabilizer for the LTS wires. Once a normal-zone appears in the LTS wires, the transport current transfers into the HTS part from one layer to another and so on. This is supposed to be a case of extreme non-uniform current distribution in the HTS part. In our experiments at 4. 2 K and 7 T bias field, we found that even with this extreme non-uniform current distribution, the HTS part was stable and the conductor did not quench fully even though the transport current was close to the critical current of the HTS part in the hybrid conductor. These experimental results suggest that non-uniform current distribution may not be a problem for the stability of HTS conductors even though many of the HTS wires carry the currents equal to critical currents. However, examination of this problem by direct experiments on real full HTS conductors might be an important future task. 　　　The experiments on LTS/HTS hybrid conductors confirmed that non-uniform current distribution may not be a problem for HTS conductors and therefore the freedom of conductor configuration can be increased for HTS conductors. Thus, we proposed a large-current capacity HTS conductors consisting of simple stacks of HTS wires, which are presently available in tape forms. This is regarded as a new but a controversial proposal, since simple stacking of superconducting strands without transpositions has never been allowed for LTS conductors. As a first step, we fabricated a 10 kA-class (at 20 K, 8 T) HTS conductor using Bi- 2223 /Ag tapes. The conductor was prepared by stacking HTS tapes in two bundles and then encasing them inside a copper jacket. The conductor size is 12 mm (width) × 7. 5 mm (thickness). An innovative technique was applied to test the HTS conductor at different temperatures from 4. 2 K to 30 K. Thin stainless steel heaters were attached to the conductor surface to elevate the temperature and then conductor was insulated by epoxy and GFRP to obtain similar conduction cooling conditions as in future magnets made of HTS conductors. We measured the critical currents of the HTS conductor at 4. 2 K, 10 K, 20 K, and 30 K and the results were found to be close to our expectations. We calculated the critical currents of the HTS conductor at different temperatures and a bias field of 8 T (parallel to the ab-plane of the HTS tapes) by taking account of the self-field generated by the transport current in the conductors. The calculated results are found to be in good agreement with the measured critical current, which shows no degradation in HTS conductors due to the handling during the fabrication process. 　　　The stability margin of the HTS conductor was also measured at different temperatures. The conductor was found to be highly stable, as it was expected from the high heat capacity of the conductor at elevated temperatures. The stability test results suggest that HTS conductors possess much higher stability margin compared to their LTS counterparts and therefore are the potential candidates for stable operations of future fusion energy reactors. 　　　We also carried out ramp rate limitation (RRL) tests on the HTS conductors. The results are very encouraging. The conductor did not show any ramp rate limitation behavior even at 1. 5 kA/s ramp rate, which was completely different from the observations in the CICC experiment described above. For HTS conductors, the critical currents were found to increase by increasing the ramp rate. This was because the conductor temperature showed lower increase due to the shorter duration of joule heating associated with the appearance of flux-flow resistance. Hence, our preliminary results suggest that RRL may not be a problem for HTS conductors unlike the LTS counterparts. It is considered that the increase of stability also gives this improvement. As our near future tasks, we will test a 10 kA-class HTS conductor using YBCO tapes. The conductor fabrication and sample development work is underway. 　　　Looking at the encouraging results of 10 kA-class HTS conductors, we have started the HTS conductor design as an option for the helical coils of the LHD-type fusion energy reactor FFHR. We have carried out several studies such as structural, quench detection and protection on the proposed 100 kA-class HTS conductors using YBCO tapes. We have considered aluminum-alloy or stainless-steel as the jacket material options for the HTS conductors. It is found that stainless-steel jacket is more suitable due to its higher strength and larger heat capacity. Our preliminary results suggest that HTS conductors might be promising candidates for the helical coils of FFHR. However, when considering the application of HTS conductors for fusion magnets, many difficult issues, such as the error magnetic fields generated by superconducting shielding currents in HTS tapes and how to make robust coil structures using fragile HTS materials, should be solved. One also has to optimize the cooling method for HTS coils. At the same time, owing to the higher stability of HTS conductors, a new design philosophy for HTS coils should be established unlike the LTS coils, which are primarily based on the cryogenic stability. In these connections, an innovative idea of having rather thin layers of HTS wires within the conductor is also proposed in the present study. By having such a configuration, the bending strain can be minimized to be ～ 0. 05...|$|R
