"If {{we make a}} {{projection}} of the best performances recently recorded in Brazil in terms of poverty and inequality reduction (2003-2008 period) to the year of 2016, {{the result would be}} a very positive social outlook.

According to the document, the majority of the progress achieved by Brazil in fighting poverty and inequality is either directly or indirectly related to the structuring of public policies of social intervention, provided for in the Federal Constitution of 1988.The Ipea also points out three other decisive factors to fighting poverty and inequality: increased social spending in the country, which went from 19% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1990 to 21.9% of the GDP in 2005; decentralization of social policy, with an extended role played by municipalities in the implementation of social policies, as their share of social spending rose 53.8% from 1980 to 2008; and social participation in the formatting and management of social policies.

40|$|Defence date: 9 March 2009 Examining Board: Prof. Gráinne De Búrca, EUI- Fordham Law School- Harvard Law School (Supervisor) Prof. Marise Cremona, EUI (Internal Advisor) Prof. Takis Tridimas, Financial Law Unit, Queen Mary, University of London Prof. Niamh Moloney, London School of Economics and Political Science- Financial Markets Group, University of LondonFinancial markets help {{allocate}} capital efficiently {{across the}} economy, thereby boosting economic growth- hence {{the salience of}} the creation of a single market in financial services within the EU single market project. Nevertheless, despite the EU's financial regulatory programme, it appears that a fully-fledged single European financial market is yet to be achieved. According to some, the substantive context of EU financial regulation is partially to account for this failure. More recently, though, both in policy and academic circles, the focus has been shifting towards the governance of EU financial law. Within this context, this thesis analyses the institutional arrangements for EU financial market regulation and supervision - crystallized in the so-called Lamfalussy framework- and explores the potential and problems of the prospect of <b>institutional</b> <b>consolidation</b> (in the form of one or more EU financial authorities) as an alternative to that framework. The debate, which seemed to have subsided in recent years, is now again coming to the fore, in light of the ongoing international financial crisis. This evidences the close relationship between substance and governance: the quality of rules ultimately depends both on the input that produced them, as well as -if not more- {{on the quality of the}} implementation, application and enforcement of the rules. This discussion on the future of EU financial governance is undertaken in two parts. The thesis examines firstly the interaction of 'classical' financial law aims (achieving efficient and stable financial markets) with 'integrationist' aims (the commitment to create a single European financial market, as a response to growing international competition). The thesis then situates the institutional question within the broader context of the EU public law framework in a more deliberate and systematic way than has hitherto been done in the existing scholarly literature. The result is an argument in favour of <b>institutional</b> <b>consolidation</b> in the EU financial sector, with an emphasis on supervision. The case of the US SEC, whose success is arguably based on its enforcement function, is used to illustrate that <b>institutional</b> <b>consolidation</b> is not synonymous with 'one size fits all' solutions, but that flexibility can be incorporated in an authority's regulatory tools. To be sure, further discussion is necessary in order to achieve this balance; but the thesis argues that we do better to focus on the details of the 'how' best to design such institutions, rather than on omphaloskeptical questions of 'whether' they are needed. Indeed, at a closer look, arguments against this approach rarely dispute the need itself for some <b>institutional</b> <b>consolidation,</b> but rather point to the difficulties in its design...|$|E

Could <b>consolidation</b> combat erratic tonnage demand, mounting regulatory pressure to provide quality service at reduced costs, rising costs of finance and unpredictable long-term returns that deter institutional capital? A questionnaire survey of capital providers' and charterers' attitudes towards consolidation found that long-term vessel employment concerned all potential capital providers, with perceptions of management experience and reputation critical to risk evaluation. Debt type providers were more supportive of consolidation practices, expecting more predictable repayment of principal and interest payments in larger companies, but equity type providers feared reduced opportunities to participate in speculative capital gains or asset play. Comparative interviews with two major crude carrier operators revealed contrasting strategies. One concentrated on pursuing short-term wealth maximisation through ensuring operational autonomy and asset flexibility and another on long-term wealth creation based on ballast minimisation and tactical capacity expansion. Long-term, a trend towards oligopoly is expected in crude tanker carriage, with competitive strategies likely to focus increasingly on differentiation as the potential for operational cost-reduction fades.

40|$|Excerpt] In recent years, the long-declining U.

Such efforts are widely viewed as {{the best hope for}} revitalizing the {{labor movement}}: breathing new life into tired old unions, winning organizing drives and raising membership levels, increasing political influence, pushing toward the power necessary to reform labor law and ineffective labor institutions. The stakes are high and the goals ambitious: to close the 2 ̆ 2 representation gap 2 ̆ 2 at the workplace, reverse growing economic and social inequality, and build new coalitions for expanded democratic participation in local, national and global politics. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to gain perspective on American labor 2 ̆ 7 s current revitalization efforts by way of historical comparison to parallel developments in comparable large industrial democracies, in particular Britain and Germany, with a background look at Italy, France and Japan.

40|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that foreign direct investment (FDI) flows {{can contribute to the}} local upgrading of host economies, whereas the diverse technological strategies of multinational companies (MNCs) can determine the existence and size of spillover effects. When considering FDI entry modes, merger and acquisitions (M&As) reveal a higher level of interaction with local productive systems than general FDI. Accordingly, their impacts may differ depending on the development level of countries and on the characteristics of national systems. Our aim is to exam the relative importance of local determinants explaining different choices of FDI entry.

That is why {{the main purpose of}} the article is a theoretical study and development of scientific and practical recommendations concerning the formation of institutional environment of agricultural land consolidation in Ukraine. The subject of study is the formation of agricultural land consolidation. Methodology. The study used the following methods: dialectical, logical and abstract, system analysis (theoretical and methodological generalizations, defining the essence of the content of institutional environment of agricultural land consolidation). This paper identifies the role of the institutions in economic development and characterised the regulatory, procedural, distributive, informational, development and accumulation functions of agricultural land consolidation institution. As a novelty items offered and provided the detailed description of the main components of the institutional environment of agricultural land consolidation such as: traditional and mental, legal, causal, organizational and structural, and procedural. The essence of institutions of each of these components and their meaning and relationships are presented. Theoretically investigated that the formation of <b>institutional</b> mechanism of <b>consolidation</b> should be a symbiosis of both traditional and market institutions based on democratic principles under community participation. The article focuses on the feasibility of the formation of mechanism for monitoring the effectiveness of institutions. As the result of the study the author proposed to consider the institutional environment of agricultural land consolidation as a regulatory system harmonizing relations of the agricultural production, social and natural resources, designed to optimize the production, based on the actual requirements and restrictions of the existing institutes and institutions to guarantee a rational use of land resources. Practical implications. Analysis of current situation in Ukraine suggests that the urgent task is particularly not only to create, design and import of the land consolidation institutions but also to provide the diagnostic of their maturity and suitability for the current level of the land consolidation relations.

40|$|The thesis {{comprises}} {{four key}} papers, which provide fresh perspectives {{pertaining to the}} key factors {{in the management of}} innovation: new ideas, people, transactions and institutions. First, a model of discovery is proposed, highlighting the importance of problem reshaping and shifting in addition to usual problem solving approach. To illustrate how they can be incorporated within existing models, the conventional NK model is adapted in a novel way that not necessarily constrains agents to local optima nearby. The extended model is then used to study effects of curiosity and conditions under which analogy, recombination or local search would be effective. Building on this model, we show how satisficing behaviour of agents can be described by using cognitive constructs such as attention and stimulus, which moderate the gap between local (agent) and non-local (real-world) information. Second, Innovation entails the interfacing of communities with different traditions and aspirations, in particular, the science and business domains. Through a quasi-experimental design, we explore the micro-foundations of the contact and conflict which define the science-business divide, strategies for mitigating discordance and exploit synergies are discussed. Third, the attempt to understand innovation as intra-firm or inter-firm process from a consistent perspective within the existing theories of the firm has provoked a reconceptualization of the 'firm'. A reductionist approach at the level of actions and assets of the firm is found to achieve this reconciliation and also helps introduce the concepts of quasi-boundary to appreciate interaction of firms with the market and the institutions. Third, the innovation process occasionally faces institutional impediments. One of the preeminent changes has been the involvement of the universities in innovation system, where its full commercial potential was realized over a century. The historical observation of how multiple institutions were reformed provides new insights into the mechanism of <b>institutional</b> entrepreneurship. Finally, <b>consolidation</b> of each of the factors requires acknowledgment that the innovation process exists in the context of each other, and are subject to evolution and extraneous influences. The conclusion is an attempt at synthesizing the four factors towards understanding the overarching dynamics in the innovation ecosystem. To leverage on the independent developments at each level, a proposal to build a consistent multi-level coherent framework for innovation is suggested.

40|$|Interviews {{with more}} than 40 leaders in the Boston area health care {{industry}} have identified a range of broadly-felt critical problems. This document synthesizes these problems and places them {{in the context of}} work and family issues implicit in the organization of health care workplaces. It concludes with questions about possible ways to address such issues. The defining circumstance for the health care industry nationally as well as regionally at present is an extraordinary reorganization, not yet fully negotiated, in the provision and financing of health care. Hoped-for controls on increased costs of medical care – specifically the widespread replacement of indemnity insurance by market-based managed care and business models of operation [...] have fallen far short of their promise. Pressures to limit expenditures have produced dispiriting conditions for the entire healthcare workforce, from technicians and aides to nurses and physicians. Under such strains, relations between managers and workers providing care are uneasy, ranging from determined efforts to maintain respectful cooperation to adversarial negotiation. Taken together, the interviews identify five key issues affecting a broad cross-section of occupational groups, albeit in different ways: Staffing shortages of various kinds throughout the health care workforce create problems for managers and workers and also for the quality of patient care. Long work hours and inflexible schedules place pressure on virtually every part of the healthcare workforce, including physicians. Degraded and unsupportive working conditions, often the result of workplace "deskilling" and "speed up," undercut previous modes of clinical practice. Lack of opportunities for training and advancement exacerbate workforce problems in an industry where occupational categories and terms of work are {{in a constant state of}} flux. Professional and employee voices are insufficiently heard in conditions of rapid <b>institutional</b> reorganization and <b>consolidation.</b> Interviewees describe multiple impacts of these issues [...] on the operation of health care workplaces, on the well being of the health care workforce, and on the quality of patient care. Also apparent in the interviews, but not clearly named and defined, is the impact of these issues on the ability of workers to attend well to the needs of their families [...] and the reciprocal impact of workers' family tensions on workplace performance. In other words, the same things that affect patient care also affect families, and vice versa. Some workers describe feeling both guilty about raising their own family issues when their patients' needs are at stake, and resentful about the exploitation of these feelings by administrators making workplace policy. The different institutions making up the health care system have responded to their most pressing issues with a variety of specific stratagems but few that address the complexities connecting relations between work and family. The MIT Workplace Center proposes a collaborative exploration of next steps to probe these complications and to identify possible locations within the health care system for workplace experimentation with outcomes benefiting all parties...|$|R

When they exist, they are organizational structures created to coordinate specific services and policies (transportation, infrastructures, environment, physical planning, etc.). The regional government, by creating a formal structure of this type, acknowledges the existence of “integrated networks of municipalities in big urban agglomerations which have economic and social linkages ” (art. 43, 7 / 1985 Act on Local Government) ...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{provides}} a comprehensive summary of contemporary transformation processes experienced by industrial districts. It is proposed that, {{along with other}} concepts of concentrated development, their recent popularity owes itself to global competitive pressures, and a need for regions in advanced economies to embark on high-road growth paths to withstand cost-based competition and maintain the status quo. Industrial districts whose understanding in literature has evolved over two decades to encompass the role of institutions and endogenous innovation capability are well positioned {{to take advantage of}} conditions in the knowledge economy, and are best seen as frameworks of dynamic adaptation. This is contrasted with new challenges brought about by the market entry of transnational corporations and <b>institutional</b> <b>consolidation</b> within the iconic North Italian districts, which results in divergent paths of adaptation leading to restructuring or dissolution. Finally, the chapter examines whether the district concept can be adapted to the development needs of Europe's socio-economic peripheries, and proposes policy lessons which {{can be applied to the}} restructuring of post-socialist industrial economic space...|$|E
40|$|Contemporary {{analysis}} of Pacific Islands regionalism is commonly {{focused on the}} institutional realm and examines how frameworks of regional governance have evolved and been strengthened. This article, by contrast, provides insight into the less well understood political content of more informal modes of Pacific Islands regional integration. In particular, it examines Pacific women 2 ̆ 7 s regional peacebuilding collaborations since the 1960 s and 1970 s. It demonstrates the political impact of Pacific women 2 ̆ 7 s collective responses to conflict in the region during the past forty years while also discussing the varying nature of this activity over time. Consideration is therefore given both to Pacific women 2 ̆ 7 s differing conceptual approaches to peacebuilding and to the differing geopolitical scope of their regional peacebuilding networks. The significance of this discussion is two-fold. First, this research provides insight {{into the history of}} "bottom-up" forms of regional engagement in the Pacific, a realm of political activity that might, if more broadly recognized, positively complement existing programs that aim to secure future security in the Pacific through regional <b>institutional</b> <b>consolidation.</b> Second, it challenges conventional perspectives on women and peacebuilding that tend to suggest that women respond to conflict in ways that are singular, homogenous, and marginal to the political mainstream...|$|E

The means by witch these agents are organized and developed are not predicted only by their public nature, but by a set of characteristics that result from an institutionalization process. Institutionalism and the foundations of bureaucratic administration are taken as reference for this paper analysis, when we discusses the elements that explain the combination of structural and symbolic components, combined with historical circumstances that have led to the institutionalization process. The methodology used in this paper consists of literature research and qualitative case study. In conclusion we present and describe the process of formation and structure of the NFS and the consolidation of the field of banking organizations in Brazil in three periods: before the banking reform of 1964, after this until the Plano Real (a financial policy), and from that to present date, corresponding to the stages of pre-formation, emerging and expanding, and institutionalized field...|$|E
