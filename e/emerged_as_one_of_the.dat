5|$|By {{the late}} 1890s, Amarillo had <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world's busiest cattle-shipping points, and its {{population}} grew significantly. The city became a grain elevator, milling, and feed-manufacturing center after {{an increase in}} production of wheat and small grains during the early 1900s. Discovery of natural gas in 1918 and oil three years later brought oil and gas companies to the Amarillo area.|$|E
5|$|During the Company Raj {{and later}} the British Raj, Tiruchirappalli <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most {{important}} cities in India. According to the 1871 Indian census—the first in British India—Tiruchirappalli had a population of 76,530, making it the second largest city in the presidency after the capital of Madras. It was known throughout the British Empire for its unique variety of cheroot, known as the Trichinopoly cigar. Tiruchirappalli was the first headquarters for the newly formed South Indian Railway Company in 1874 until its relocation to Madras in the early 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Returning from injury the {{following}} season, Bertuzzi <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Canucks' best offensive contributors, finishing with 25 goals (second {{on the team}} to Markus Näslund) and 50 points in 1999–2000. At {{the end of the}} season, he received the team's Most Exciting Player Award, as voted by the fans. He received the distinction three more times during his career with the Canucks from 2002 to 2004). Meanwhile, the Canucks began improving as a team, finishing four points out of a playoff spot in the West in 2000.|$|E
5|$|To {{improve his}} officiating, Bavetta {{refereed}} {{games for the}} New Jersey pro league and Rucker League in Harlem during the off-seasons and studied NBA rulebooks. In 1983, {{he became the first}} referee to undergo rigorous physical training. He ran six to eight miles and took three-hour naps every day. His effort paid off when he <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best referees. In the 1980s, he was named chief referee, who has the power to approve or overrule calls made by other officials. He was assigned to officiate his first playoff game in 1986.|$|E

5|$|From 2009, the Swedish economy <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world's fastest {{recovering}} economies {{with high}} competitiveness. Sweden was noted for having proved {{to overcome the}} crisis {{better than any other}} developed countries, and this was highlighted by the Government as a force in the run-up to 2010 general election. As Sweden emerged as the best country on several areas after the financial crisis it brought a resurgence of support, which eventually resulted in his re-election in 2010. This was the first time ever that the Moderate Party was re-eleted after completing a full first term.|$|E
5|$|In 1921 Margaret Mackworth, now {{the second}} Viscountess Rhondda, {{launched}} the Six Point Group, an action group that focused {{heavily on the}} equality {{between men and women}} and the rights of the child. Mackworth continued to strive towards equality for women and <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leading feminist campaigners in Britain during the inter-war period. She established a number of women's organisations, pressure groups and launched the influential feminist journal Time and Tide. She also made an unsuccessful bid to gain entry into the House of Lords, fighting against a 1922 ruling that barred the admission of women.|$|E
5|$|Reinfeldt's {{first term}} in office was marked by the late-2000s {{financial}} crisis and recession. His popularity fell until the economy of Sweden <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strongest in Europe; this brought a resurgence of support for him, resulting in his government's re-election in 2010. Despite the Moderate Party getting its highest share of the vote since the introduction of universal suffrage in 1921, Reinfeldt's government {{was reduced to a}} minority government, owing to the rise of Sweden Democrats; but he remained in power as the first centre-right Prime Minister since the Swedish-Norwegian Union to be re-elected.|$|E

5|$|Schwartz {{argues that}} Lincoln's American {{reputation}} grew {{slowly in the}} late 19th century until the Progressive Era (1900–1920s) when he <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most venerated heroes in American history, with even white Southerners in agreement. The high point came in 1922 with {{the dedication of the}} Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. In the New Deal era liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who they believe would have supported the welfare state. In the Cold War years, Lincoln's image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes.|$|E
5|$|The 2004–05 NHL lockout, which {{cancelled}} {{the full}} 2004–05 NHL season, forced Kesler {{to spend the}} entire season with the Moose. With Manitoba, Kesler <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Canucks' top prospects. Midway through the season, Kesler {{was named to the}} PlanetUSA All-Star team for the 2005 AHL All-Star Game where he helped PlanetUSA defeat Team Canada {{for the first time in}} five years. Kesler finished third in team scoring with thirty goals and 57 points to be named the Moose's Most Valuable Player. Kesler added an additional nine points in fourteen playoff games as the Moose advanced to the Western Conference finals before being swept by the Chicago Wolves.|$|E
5|$|The loss of ecclesiastical {{patronage}} {{that resulted}} from the Reformation created a crisis for native craftsmen and artists, who turned to secular patrons. One result of this was the flourishing of Scottish Renaissance painted ceilings and walls. Other forms of domestic decoration included tapestries and stone and wood carving. In {{the first half of}} the eighteenth century there was an increasing professionalisation and organisation of art. Large numbers of artists took the grand tour to Italy. The Academy of St. Luke was founded as a society for artists in 1729. It included among its members Allan Ramsay, who <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important British artists of the era.|$|E

5|$|Benjamin {{spent the}} summer of 1851 abroad, {{including}} a visit to Paris to see Natalie and Ninette. He was still away in October 1851, when the Whigs nominated him for the state Senate. Despite his absence, he was easily elected. When the new legislature met in January 1852, Benjamin <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leading Whig candidates for election to the U.S. Senate seat that would become vacant on March 4, 1853. As the Louisiana legislature, responsible for electing the state's senators, met once in two years under the 1845 constitution, it was not scheduled to meet again before the seat became vacant. Some Whig newspapers thought Benjamin too young and inexperienced at forty, despite his undoubted talent, but the Whig legislative caucus selected him on the second ballot, and he was elected by the two houses over Democrat Solomon W. Downs.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after he}} {{finished}} his education, he served for two years as rector of the collegiate school at St. John's Church in Warsaw. From October 1557 he tutored Jan Tęczyński, son of magnate Andrzej Tęczyński, and visited Vienna with his pupil, where he likely became closely acquainted with the Society of Jesus, a key order of the counter-reformation. He then returned to Poland, which <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main terrains of struggle between the Protestant Reformation movement and the Catholic Church's counter-reformation. From 1562 {{he served as a}} parson in Rohatyn, and around 1564 he took holy orders. That year he became a canon, and the following year he also served as chancellor of the Lwów chapter. From 1566 to 1567 he was chaplain at the court of castellan Jan Krzysztof Tarnowski (the royal secretary to King Sigismund II Augustus); after Tarnowski's death he returned to Lwów, taking up the position of the cathedral preacher.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1986 {{season the}} Browns lost {{standout}} safety and former defensive {{rookie of the}} year Don Rogers. Rogers died of a cocaine overdose leaving the team without one of its best defenders in the secondary for the 1986 season. Despite the tumultuous off season, 1986 marked Cleveland's entry into the ranks of the NFL's elite as Kosar's play improved and the defensive unit came together. Kosar threw for 3,854yards to a corps of receivers that included Brian Brennan, Newsome and rookie Webster Slaughter. On defense, cornerbacks Frank Minnifield and Hanford Dixon <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NFL's premiere pass-defending duos. After a slow start, the Browns rose {{to the top of the}} divisional standings, twice beating the Pittsburgh Steelers and ending a 16-game losing streak at Three Rivers Stadium. A 12–4 record earned Cleveland home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|So far, {{there is}} no {{evidence}} that life exists on Europa, but Europa has <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most likely locations in the Solar System for potential habitability. Life could exist in its under-ice ocean, perhaps in an environment similar to Earth's deep-ocean hydrothermal vents. Even if Europa lacks volcanic hydrothermal activity, a 2016 NASA study found that Earth-like levels of hydrogen and oxygen could be produced through processes related to serpentinization and ice-derived oxidants, which do not directly involve volcanism. In 2015, scientists announced that salt from a subsurface ocean may likely be coating some geological features on Europa, suggesting that the ocean is interacting with the seafloor. This may be important in determining if Europa could be habitable. The likely presence of liquid water in contact with Europa's rocky mantle has spurred calls to send a probe there.|$|E
5|$|The 2006–07 {{season was}} a {{learning}} experience for the young Arsenal squad and Fàbregas. The club again failed to secure any major honours and were defeated by city rivals Chelsea in the League Cup Final. Fàbregas, however, <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> key creative players for the team, playing in every single league game. He kick-started Arsenal's 2006–07 UEFA Champions League campaign when he scored a brace in a 3–0 win over Dinamo Zagreb in a qualifier match. In the Premier League, he notched up 13 assists, which was the second-highest total in the league. He ended the season with several individual honours, including the Golden Boy award, presented by the Italian paper TuttoSport, based on a poll of leading writers across Europe. He was also named in the 2006 UEFA Team of the Year, and named FA Premier League Player of the Month for January 2007. Additionally, he was nominated for both PFA Players' Player of the Year and PFA Young Player of the Year, although both awards went to Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo. In June 2007, he was named Arsenal's Player of the Season, taking in 60% of the votes.|$|E
5|$|The Thanjavur Marathas {{gained control}} during the later part of 18th century until its {{annexation}} by the British East India Company in 1799. It was constituted as a municipality during 1866 {{and was a}} part of the erstwhile Tanjore district. The town was the headquarters and the only town in Mannargudi taluk. The town <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chief centres of inland trade in the district during the British rule. Rice, betel leaves, groundnut, oil, metal articles and clothes were the major exports. A Methodist mission was established in the town during the third decade of the 19th century. During 1944, Chinese copper coins were unearthed from Thaliketti village in the region, dated to Sui period (585 CE) to the end of Song period (1275 CE). The coins indicate a possible Buddhist influence in the region. Mannargudi continued to be part of Tanjore district until India's independence in 1947 and Thanjavur district until 1991 and subsequently a part of the newly formed Tiruvarur district.|$|E
