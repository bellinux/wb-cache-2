They had indeed {{considered}} it little, because they had always seen it; and none but philosophers, nor they always, are struck with wonder otherwise than by novelty.|$|E
500|$|The Hands {{also became}} close friends of Cornish {{resident}} Louis Dow, a Dartmouth College professor. Frances Hand spent {{increasing amounts of}} time with Dow while her husband was in New York, and tension crept into the marriage. Despite speculation, however, {{there is no evidence}} that she and Dow were lovers. Hand regretted Frances' long absences and urged her to spend more time with him, but he maintained an enduring friendship with Dow. He blamed himself for a lack of insight into his wife's needs in the early years of the marriage, confessing his [...] "blindness and <b>insensibility</b> to what you wanted and to your right to your own ways when they differed from mine". Fearing he might otherwise lose her altogether, Hand came to accept Frances' desire to spend time in the country with another man.|$|E

Unsuspecting sailors and miners are {{entrapped}} by the dexterous thieves and swindlers that are always on the lookout, into these dens, where they are filled with liquor – drugged if necessary, until <b>insensibility</b> coming upon them, they fall an easy victim to their tempters... When the habitues of this quarter {{have a reason to}} believe a man has money, they will follow him for days, and employ every device to get him into their clutches...

2500|$|Following {{the death}} of the Marquis de Montcalm and the fall of Québec on 18 September – after the colonel's aborted attempt to {{resupply}} the besieged city – Bougainville was dispatched to the western front by his new commanding officer, the Chevalier de Lévis. He attempted to stop the British advance from his entrenchments at Île-aux-Noix. He was among the officers who accompanied Lévis to Saint Helen's Island off Montreal for the last French stand in North America before the general capitulation of 1761. Of the war, Bougainville wrote in his journal: [...] "It is an abominable kind of war. The very air we breathe is contagious of <b>insensibility</b> and hardness".|$|E
2500|$|... "The Sleepy Distemper (common {{among the}} Negroes) gives no other {{previous}} Notice, than a want of Appetite 2 or 3 days before; their sleeps are sound, and Sense and Feeling very little; for pulling, drubbing or whipping will scarce stir up Sense and Power enough to move; and the Moment you cease beating the smart is forgot, and down they fall again {{into a state}} of <b>Insensibility,</b> drivling constantly from the Mouth as in deep salivation; breathe slowly, but not unequally nor snort. Young people are more subject to it than the old; and the Judgement generally pronounced is Death, the Prognostik seldom failing.

2500|$|To {{many members}} of the Oxford Movement, Newman included, it was Kingsley's ideal of domesticity that seemed unmanly. As R. W. Church put it, [...] "To shrink from [...] was a mark of want of {{strength}} or intelligence, of an unmanly preference for English home life, of <b>insensibility</b> to the generous devotion and purity of the saints". Defending his decision to remain single, Charles Reding, the hero of Newman's novel Loss and Gain, argues that [...] "surely the idea of an Apostle, unmarried, pure, in fast and nakedness, and at length a martyr, is a higher idea than that of one of the old Israelites sitting under his vine and fig-tree, full of temporal goods, and surrounded by sons and grandsons?" [...] James Eli Adams remarks that if manliness is equated with physical and psychological toughness, then perhaps [...] "manhood cannot be sustained within domesticity, since the ideal is incompatible with ease". A [...] "common antagonism to domesticity" [...] links [...] "Tractarian discipline to Carlylean heroism".|$|E
2500|$|Historically, the Calvinist {{tradition}} has placed {{the blame on}} nonbelievers. Calvin's religious epistemology {{is based on the}} sensus divinitatis (Sense of Divinity), the view that the presence of God is universally perceived by all humans. Paul Helm explains, [...] "Calvin’s use of the term 'sense' signals that the knowledge of God is a common human endowment; mankind is created not only as capable of knowing God, but as actually knowing him." [...] According to this tradition, there is no inculpable or nonresistant nonbelief. Jonathan Edwards, the 18th century American theologian, claimed that while every human being has been granted the capacity to know God, successful use of these capacities requires an attitude of [...] "true benevolence," [...] a willingness to be open to the truth about God. Thus, the failure of non-believers to see [...] "divine things" [...] is in his view due to [...] "a dreadful stupidity of mind, occasioning a sottish <b>insensibility</b> of their truth and importance." ...|$|E
