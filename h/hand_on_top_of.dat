25|$|His biggest {{contribution}} to the game of field hockey was the 'half push- half hit'- a stroke he used {{to hit the ball}} using the same grip used to dribble the ball. With the left <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the handle and the right half low down around the centre of the stick he used to essay this shot with a minimum back lift and slam the ball towards his partner-teammate to make an early and accurate pass. The same stroke was adapted by his successor Dhanraj Pillay, who was an ardent fan of the maestro. Earlier the stroke or technique did not exist in a field hockey player's repertoire or in the game's coaching manual.|$|E
500|$|Members of {{the crew}} would later provide {{conflicting}} accounts of Heywood's actions during the mutiny. Boatswain William Cole testified that Heywood had been detained on the ship against his will. Ship's carpenter William Purcell thought that Heywood's ambiguous behaviour during the critical hours—he had been seen unwittingly resting his <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> a cutlass—was due to his youth and {{the excitement of the}} moment, and that he had no hand in the uprising itself. On the other hand, Midshipman John Hallett reported that Bligh, with a bayonet at his breast and his hands tied, had addressed a remark to Heywood who had [...] "laughed, turned round and walked away". Another midshipman, Thomas Hayward, claimed he had asked Heywood his intentions and been told by the latter that he would remain with the ship, from which Hayward assumed that his messmate had sided with the mutineers.|$|E

50|$|Hill {{is perhaps}} best remembered for his {{emotional}} reaction after his Duke teammate Christian Laettner hit a last second shot to defeat Kentucky in the elite eight of the 1992 NCAA Tournament.

50|$|In a {{drum and}} bugle corps, the marching style for {{contrabass}} bugles {{are the same}} as {{for the rest of the}} hornline. However, there can be small differences, especially with effects such as ripples of the hornline. Often, instead of snapping the horn up or down or to the side, the players will have their horns bell down on the ground and will snap their <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the horn.|$|R
2500|$|Chute Dogging is {{an event}} to teach pre-teen boys how to steer wrestle. The {{competitor}} enters a bucking chute with a small steer. The boy will then place his right arm around the steer's neck and left <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> its neck. When ready, the gate is opened and steer and contestant exit the chute. Once they cross over a designated line, the competitor will grab onto the horns of the steer (colloquially, to [...] "hook-up" [...] to the steer) and wrestle it to the ground.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005 {{a bronze}} statue of Albany's 73rd mayor Thomas Whalen III (served 1983-93) and his golden {{retriever}} named Finn McCool {{was installed in}} the park. The statue is seated {{on a park bench}} with his right <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the dog's head. Mayor Whalen is the only mayor of Albany to have a statue erected in his honor in the city. A statue for Mayor Corning was proposed and commissioned though it was never cast, a clay model of which sat in Mayor Whalen's office for many years. The statues of Mayor Whalen and his dog are life-size, and including the bench the monument is [...] long and [...] wide, it was designed by Hy Rosen.|$|E
2500|$|Putting is {{considered}} {{to be the most important}} component of the game of golf. As the game of golf has evolved, there have been many different putting techniques and grips that have been devised to give golfers the best chance to make putts. When the game originated, golfers would putt with their dominate hand on the bottom of the grip and their weak <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the grip. This grip and putting style is known as [...] "conventional". There are many variations of conventional including overlap, where the golfer overlaps the off hand index finger onto off the dominant pinky; interlock, where the offhand index finger interlocks with the dominant pinky and ring finger; double or triple overlap and so on. Recently, [...] "cross handed" [...] putting has become a popular trend amongst professional golfers and amateurs. Cross handed putting is the idea that the dominant hand is on top of the grip where the weak hand is on the bottom. This grip restricts the motion in your dominant hand and eliminates the possibility of wrist breakdowns through the putting stroke.|$|E

5|$|Spilled hot {{cooking oil}} {{can also cause}} severe third degree burns, In the {{worst-case}} scenario, severe burns can be fatal. The higher temperatures and tendency of oil {{to stick to the}} skin make spilled hot cooking oil far more dangerous than spilled hot water. Children can accidentally place their <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the stove, playing with the materials while being cooked, or accidentally pull the pot down, which can cause significant injury. The utmost care should be used when deep frying when children are present, to protect their safety at all times.|$|R

60|$|The fellow {{looked at}} him stupidly, as if his nerve had failed, or he thought the order too risky to obey. There was {{only one thing to}} be done, and since it must be done at once, Dick must {{undertake}} it himself. The engine was now running down the line after the truck, which had not gathered much speed yet, and he climbed across the coal and dropped upon the rear buffer-frame. Balancing himself upon it, he waited until the gap between him and the truck got narrower, and then put his <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the concrete and swung himself across. He got his foot upon the side of the car and made his way along, holding the top of the block, while the dust rolled about him and he thought he would be jolted off. Indeed, there was only an inch-wide ledge of smooth iron to support his foot, which slipped once or twice; but he reached the brake-gear and screwed it down. Then, crawling back, he hooked on the spare coupling and returned, breathless and shaky, to his engine. A minute or two later he brought it to a stop and had got down upon the line when somebody called him.|$|E

50|$|In {{this event}} the axemen use identically tuned and {{sharpened}} chainsaws {{to cut through}} a log, once downwards and once upwards, within a 3-inch space of wood. The competitor starts with their <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the log. <b>On</b> a buzzer the axeman picks up the saw and pulls the starting cord and then makes his first cut downward, then his second cut upward. If the saw does not start that is just bad luck and they get a slow time. If the axeman takes over more than the allocated wood then they are disqualified and no time is recorded.|$|R

50|$|Also {{known as}} a double arm suplex, reverse nelson suplex, double axe handle suplex, and a {{butterfly}} suplex, the wrestler and opponent face each other, the opponent bent forward. The wrestler hooks the opponent's arms back in a reverse nelson, placing his forearms in the crooks of the opponent's elbows, with his <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the opponent's back in a butcher's grip. The wrestler then lifts the opponent into an upside-down vertical position and falls back, shifting the opponent to one side as the opponent flips over. The wrestler executing the suplex may release the reverse nelson hold during the throw, or can maintain the grip and attempt a bridging pin or submission hold transition upon impact.|$|R
