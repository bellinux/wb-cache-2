50|$|Manufactured bamboo {{floors are}} {{typically}} made available in planks with either vertical- or horizontal-grain orientation. In vertical bamboo floors, the component pieces are stood vertically on their narrowest edge and then press laminated side to side. The {{effect is a}} lined, almost uniform look {{to the surface of}} the finished <b>floor</b> <b>plank.</b> In horizontal bamboo floors, the slats are arranged in a horizontal direction, on their widest edge, and then joined side by side with adjacent pieces using a high-pressure laminate system. The characteristic nodes of the bamboo are visible on the finished horizontal surface.|$|E

Barnyard Dawg returns the favor, and the process repeats several times until the tank becomes dislodged and crashes on top of the ring, leaving both Foghorn and Barnyard Dawg with their heads buried in the ground.

5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1865, a Confederate captain named Charlie Bullock {{captured}} some of these refugees and locked them up in a wooden shack near Woodville, but they managed to escape. According to Lance Rosier and Cecil Overstreet, when the Jayhawkers were brought to Woodville there were guards placed all around them. In order to free the men, whiskey was brought by a local sympathizer and the fiddle playing ensued. [...] One of the Jayhawkers, Mr. Warren Collins, snuck his pocket knife in tucked away in his boot. Using some backwoods ingenuity the Jayhawkers pried a <b>floor</b> <b>plank</b> up in {{the floor of the}} shack. [...] As the fiddle playing continued, Warren began to dance a [...] "jig" [...] entertaining the inebriated guards. [...] As Warren danced about, the Jayhawkers escaped one by one through the plank lifted up in the floor. In the commotion that followed, Mr. Collins crawled out from the wooden shack and simply walked to freedom.|$|E

The first large-scale aktion in the Łuck Ghetto took place on [...] About 17,000 Jews were rounded up by Nazi Orpo police and the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police during a four-day period, assembled at the square by the pharmacy, and taken in lorries along with women and children, to the Górka Połonka forest, {{on the outskirts of}} Łuck (see map). They were shot into the prepared trenches. During the deportations, the small ghetto in Hnidawa (Gnidawa) was also emptied. A few families survived in the pharmacy cellars, including eyewitness Shmuel Shilo (age thirteen), along with his mother and brothers; Shmuel's sister was rescued by the Poles. Meanwhile, the labor camp remained in operation for a few more months. The main ghetto ceased to exist; Jews who were still alive were relocated back to the small ghetto in Gnidawa. They were rounded up on [...] and marched to Lubart's Castle; from there, they were sent to their deaths at Połonka.

40|$|Wooden {{beams and}} planks from the Spanish Colonial church and other {{structures}} in Las Trampas, north-central New Mexico, have been sampled and dated by dendrochronology. Dates of AD 1735 imply Spanish {{occupation of the}} area 16 years prior to official grant. Stockpiling of timber for church construction began as early as 1758. Exterior walls were 15 feet high by 1762 and were completed to roof level by 1764. Late in 1776, wood was cut for a dust-guard over the adobe altar and mural. According to clustering of tree-ring dates, a new altar and wooden altar screen were constructed soon after 1785. Beam re-use was prevalent. Timbers bearing early dates were incorporated into the 1785 altar screen, indicating re-use from within the church or from other pre- 1760 structures. A roof viga was later used as a <b>floor</b> <b>plank</b> after reroofing. In domestic buildings, re-use of beams is repeated. Replacement of beams supporting the balcony {{was made in the}} 1860 's and 1870 's. Tree-ring dates indicate repairs again in the 1930 's and 1943. A survey of the literature pertaining to dendrochronology of historical sites revealed that shaping of beams and lack of thorough sampling have heretofore hindered successful application. The documentary record of Las Trampas art and architectural history has been further refined by tree -ring dating, and the study reaffirms the potentials for historical sites dendrochronology...|$|E

A large portion of the fort was retrofitted to hold ammunition, and the <b>flooring</b> <b>planks</b> were nailed in with wooden nails to prevent explosions caused by soldiers' boots striking metal nails.

Plug's tactics were to sneak aboard personally, or have one of his pirates secretly go into the hull of a boat, and dig out the caulking between the <b>floor</b> <b>planks</b> or drill holes with an auger, causing the boat to sink and be easily attacked. The boat and the cargo would later be sold down river.|$|R

The buildings had gabled roofs, raised <b>floors,</b> <b>plank</b> walls, and were thatched with reed or covered with hinoki cypress bark. Such early shrines {{did not include a}} space for worship. Three important forms of ancient shrine architectural styles exist: taisha-zukuri, shinmei-zukuri and sumiyoshi-zukuri. They are exemplified by Izumo Taisha, Nishina Shinmei Shrine and Sumiyoshi Taisha respectively and date to before 552.

50|$|The {{building}} {{was designed and}} built for the Commonwealth government over the period 1970 to 1974. The building is of a precast, prestressed concrete construction. Its elements are radically simple: the entire structure was created using repeating patterns of just three different components: 26 metre-long facade beams, 16 metre-long floor beams or 'planks', and 1.5 metre column elements. It contains a total of 50 000 square metres of office space in seven wings, enclosing two courtyards. The building has undergone various subsequent modifications, notably including the retrofitting of cladding beneath the exposed first <b>floor</b> <b>floor</b> <b>planks</b> which, while improving thermal performance, has been criticised for obscuring the original design of the building.|$|R
