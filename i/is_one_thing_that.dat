Built around The Meters' funky beat-driven percussion, [...] "1 Thing" [...] finds Amerie lamenting an aspect of a relationship that keeps her satisfied. Even if other factors are less than positive, there <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> keeps her hooked ("It's this one thing that's got me trippin'"). Amerie said that {{the inspiration for the}} song came from a conversation she had with Harrison [...] "about relationships and how there's always one thing that keeps you attracted to someone. No matter what they do or how they act, there's that one undeniable thing that keeps you coming back." [...] She told Blender that the [...] "one thing" [...] "could be bringing flowers, or something more ... physical. People think I'm just this good girl, but there are other sides they don't see." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gould also {{addressed}} the issue of selfish genes in his essay [...] "Caring groups and selfish genes". Gould acknowledged that Dawkins was not imputing conscious action to genes, but simply using a shorthand metaphor commonly found in evolutionary writings. To Gould, the fatal flaw was that [...] "no matter how much power Dawkins wishes to assign to genes, there <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> he cannot give them – direct visibility to natural selection." [...] Rather, the unit of selection is the phenotype, not the genotype, because it is phenotypes that interact with the environment at the natural-selection interface. So, in Kim Sterelny's summation of Gould's view, [...] "gene differences do not cause evolutionary changes in populations, they register those changes." [...] Richard Dawkins replied to this criticism in a later book, The Extended Phenotype, that Gould confused particulate genetics with particulate embryology, stating that genes do [...] "blend", as far as their effects on developing phenotypes are concerned, but that they do not blend as they replicate and recombine down the generations.|$|E

60|$|But before {{proceeding}} further, there <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> had {{got to be}} understood between us, and understood clearly.|$|R
60|$|If there <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> Mumps liked, it was root beer, {{while he}} knew candied fruit was very rich eating. Accordingly he hesitated.|$|R
60|$|If there <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> Diane Sampson {{could not}} bear it was to see an animal in pain. She passionately loved horses, and hated {{the sight of a}} spur or whip.|$|R
6000|$|... "I understand, and I {{think the}} plan good--for you--and yet, Baas, there <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> I have not told you which may mar it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{there is}} yet one thing more," [...] I cried. [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> must be stopped, being mere ruin to herself, and to me too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mary Erskine, [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> {{you could}} do for me, {{that would be a}} very great {{kindness}}, a very great kindness indeed." ...|$|E
60|$|No, he did {{not know}} what was real and what was not; but there <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> he did know--never again would he eat of the flesh of Tantor, the elephant.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've a faint {{recollection}} <b>that</b> there <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> {{would break}} the charm," [...] said he; [...] "but misfortune has so addled my brain that I can't remember what it was." ...|$|R
60|$|If there <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> Miss Millet had {{a horror}} of, it was housebreakers. She leaped out of bed, {{and began to}} dress in terror, having roused Rose, who slept with her.|$|R
6000|$|Somehow {{they found}} {{themselves}} outside in the cool, green garden, and then, after a stunned silence, Turnbull said: [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> was puzzling me all the time, and I understand it now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> {{you have}} not told me," [...] Guy said when he ceased speaking. [...] "Having, as you say, good clients besides your gains here, why should you trouble to {{interest}} yourself in our affairs?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I rather {{think there}} <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> you have forgotten," [...] said Mr. Holiday, [...] "and which, it strikes me, is a decided {{objection}} to your plan; and that is, that the steamer for to-morrow, from New Haven, leaves at midnight." ...|$|E
6000|$|MATT. Then said Matthew, Fear <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> made {{me think}} that I was far from having that within me that accompanies salvation; {{but if it were}} so with such a good man as he, why may it not also go well with me? ...|$|R
60|$|Tarzan {{nodded his}} head. He {{was a man}} of few words, and {{possibly}} it was for this reason as much as any that Kadour ben Saden had taken to him, for if there <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> an Arab despises it is a talkative man.|$|R
5000|$|And there <b>was</b> only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> {{filled my}} heart with sadness ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am glad,' said Phoebe, 'that {{you knew}} too well {{to think there}} was any real difference. Indeed, the superiority is all yours, except in mere money. And mine, I am sure, need not stand in the way, but there <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> does.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed I am {{unworthy of}} {{anything}} so charming,' answered the cloud; 'but {{you make a}} mistake again in what you say. There <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> is even more powerful than I, and that is the wind. Ah, here he comes, you can see for yourself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|He paused. He {{was ashamed}} of this avowal. [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> makes up for all. I have known you. Across this gulf of time I have come to you. The rest is done. It is done. With you, too, it has been {{something}} more--or something less--" ...|$|E
6000|$|MATT. Then said Matthew, [...] "Fear <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> made {{me think}} that I was far from having that within me which makes me sure of being saved. But if it were so with such a good man as he, why may it not also go well with me?" ...|$|R
50|$|People think I'm rich but I haven’t {{worked for}} three years so not a lot is left. If there <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> would help a lot. Davy works {{intensely}} hard to support me and Noah, {{but it is hard}} living off one wage. For now I am content as a housewife, but I hope to contribute more soon.|$|R
50|$|There <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> did not change: the {{official}} {{name of the}} currency. Although the ISO 4217 was altered the relevant legislation {{made the point that}} {{the official}} name of the currency is still the złoty. New Polish złoty is an unofficial way to address the Polish currency (Dziennik Ustaw nr 50, 459, with later changes).|$|R
6000|$|... "You argue well; {{but there}} <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> you overlook, though I {{am sorry to}} have to pain you by saying it; young Mr. Heigham is no better than he should be. I have made {{inquiries}} about him, and think that I ought to tell you that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I don’t know yet. We’ll talk it over later on. The {{thing to}} do now is to locate Jasniff and get the rest of the jewels. Don’t forget that he has the finest of the diamonds. That <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> made Link sore—Jasniff taking the lion’s share.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How {{good of you}} not {{to forget}} me {{when you are in}} the midst of such dangers and hardships,' {{answered}} she. 'Yes, it is true I have many beautiful things; but if you want to give me a present--and to-morrow is my birthday--there <b>IS</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> I wish for very much.' ...|$|E
60|$|So you {{see there}} <b>was</b> only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> all <b>were</b> agreed upon--that Oz should be destroyed.|$|R
6000|$|She {{heaved a}} gentle sigh. [...] "I am {{so glad to}} hear that," [...] she said. [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> I <b>was</b> {{thinking}} about just before you came and which gave {{me a little bit}} of comfort; the words and yells I heard were dreadfully oniony, and somehow or other I could not connect <b>that</b> sort of <b>thing</b> with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Valuable? Heavens! lad, it <b>is</b> the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> lifts man {{above the}} beasts that perish and makes him heir to immortality!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But there <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> I don't quite understand. Your navy, your ships. There, surely, we have you: {{sooner or}} later that whole proud fleet in the Kiel Canal will come out under fire of our guns and be sunk {{to the bottom of}} the sea. There, at least, we conquer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do, as a rule," [...] was {{the quiet}} reply, [...] "only {{sometimes}} Henry intervenes. If there <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> the modern servant dislikes, it is sarcasm, and sarcasm is Henry's favourite weapon {{when he wants}} to be really disagreeable. Generally speaking, I think a servant would rather be sworn at." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{to thank}} you, gentlemen, for your advice," [...] said I. [...] "And now I would like, by your leave, to set you two or three questions. There <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> has fallen rather on one side,--for instance: Will this cause do any good to our friend James of the Glens?" ...|$|E
60|$|Poor Romola! There <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> {{would have}} made the pang of {{disappointment}} in her husband harder to bear; it <b>was,</b> that any <b>one</b> should know he gave her cause for disappointment. This might be a woman's weakness, but it is closely allied to a woman's nobleness. She who willingly lifts up the veil of her married life has profaned it from a sanctuary into a vulgar place.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a world's wonder! There <b>is</b> only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> surprises me. Was it by {{accident}} that <b>one</b> window <b>was</b> left unfinished?" ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> she Mary did {{and does}} <b>is</b> the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> {{we all have}} to do, namely, to bear Christ into the world.|$|R
