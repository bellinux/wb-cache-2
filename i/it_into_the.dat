5|$|After ReaLemon {{met with}} success in European markets, Borden {{introduced}} <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom in 1975, as a 250 ml bottle of lemon juice. By 1980, ReaLemon comprised around 25% of the U.K. lemon juice market. In {{response to this}} competition, Reckitt & Coleman, the producers of Jif lemon juice began producing Jif in 150 ml- and 250 ml-sized bottles. Borden then began making plans to market ReaLemon in a lemon-shaped package that was similar to Jif's packaging. This resulted in a lawsuit initiated by Reckitt & Coleman against Borden, alleging that ReaLemon copied Jif's packaging to mislead consumers by confusing their product with Jif.|$|E

5|$|After braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose {{return to}} the boat deck. The {{lifeboats}} have departed and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water.

He assures her that she will die an old woman, warm in her bed. Jack dies of hypothermia but Rose is saved.|$|E
5|$|After his {{problems}} in the first session, Vettel was fastest in the second session on Friday afternoon. Nico Rosberg was second, about {{a tenth of a}} second behind, but did not set any timed laps in the last twenty minutes as his car was losing gearbox oil. Lewis Hamilton meanwhile struggled on the super-soft tyres, making several errors that left him fifth. Both Lotus cars made <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> top ten, with Pastor Maldonado and Romain Grosjean in fourth and seventh respectively. Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso was the fastest Renault-powered car in eighth position, while the McLarens once again had to stop their session early.|$|E

Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, William Kotzwinkle's The Fan Man, Eric Rücker Eddison's The Worm Ouroboros, Stephen Crane's , Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer novels and an anthropomorphic depiction of Sherlock Holmes.

The entire radar dipole aerial setup for the AI Mk.IV was simple in comparison to the 32-dipole Matratze (mattress) transceiving array fitted to the noses of the earliest German night fighters to use AI radar, for their own UHF-band Lichtenstein B/C airborne radar design from 1942–43.|$|E

5|$|Arriving at Mauritius on 29 April 1836, Darwin was {{impressed}} by the civilised prosperity of the French colony which had come under British rule. He toured the island, examining its volcanic mountains and fringing coral reefs. The Surveyor-general Captain Lloyd took him on the only elephant on the island to see an elevated coral plain.

5|$|Boating on {{the canal}} is encouraged, {{although}} {{the lack of}} a link to the River Parrett at Bridgwater is restrictive. At this point, the Parrett is a salt water river, and is laden with silt, whereas the canal contains fresh water. Not only is there a risk of silt entering the canal, but the salt water cannot be allowed to contaminate the fresh, as the canal is still used for the transport of drinking water for the population of Bridgwater. The canal forms part of the local flood relief system, in winter taking water from the River Tone at Taunton and discharging <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Parrett at a sluice in the western fringe of Bridgwater, near the Bridgwater Canalside Centre.|$|E

The breed is also popular in their native Russia as their small size makes them suitable to be kept in busy cities, and easily transported to hunting sites.|$|E
