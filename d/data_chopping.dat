40|$|The C/EBP {{homologous}} protein CHOP is normally present at low levels in cells but increases rapidly after insults such as DNA damage or endoplasmatic reticulum stress where {{it contributes to}} cellular homeostasis and apoptosis. By forming heterodimers with other transcription factors, CHOP can either act as a dominant-negative regulator of gene expression or to induce the expression of target genes. Recent work demonstrated that seizure-induced hippocampal damage is significantly worse in mice lacking CHOP and these animals go on to develop an aggravated epileptic phenotype. To identify novel CHOP-controlled target genes which potentially influence the epileptic phenotype, we performed a bioinformatics analysis of tissue microarrays from chop-deficient mice after prolonged seizures. GO analysis revealed genes associated with biological membranes were prominent among those in the chop-deficient array dataset and we identified myelin-associated genes to be particularly de-repressed.

In terms of the getting <b>data</b> set, <b>chopped</b> lightning impulse voltages with different chopping times are considered and MRA is applied to these data as different case studies. Hence, some characteristic properties are extracted from the impulse waveforms at some special frequency values. In this sense, frequency component of 33 MHz is found with a maximum peak value for each case before the chopping time and their appearing times for two cases are determined using the time-frequency analysis. Hence difference between the chopping time and occurring time of the maximum peak values at 33 MHz is calculated easily. Also, some physical interpretations of the frequency component of 33 MHz are defined through the circuit parameters of the measurement system. In usual application, the MRA can be presented as a powerful technique to extract the noise effects, which come from the different sources, in the high voltage measurements...|$|R

The decompressor computes the inverse transform based on this reduced number of Fourier coefficients.

We demonstrated the induction of ER stress in response to tunicamycin stimulation, as evidenced by increased expression of chaperone proteins Grp 78, Grp 94, and enhanced eukaryotic initiation factor 2 subunit 1 (eIF 2 α) phosphorylation in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Tunicamycin-induced ER stress resulted in apoptosis and autophagy simultaneously. While inhibition of autophagy mediated by 3 -methyladenine pretreatment or direct knockdown of LC 3 B promoted cell apoptosis, activation of autophagy with rapamycin decreased tunicamycin- induced apoptosis in HCC cells. Furthermore, CHOP was shown to be significantly upregulated upon treatment with tunicamycin in HCC cells. Specific knockdown of CHOP not only enhanced tunicamycin-induced autophagy, but also significantly attenuated ER stress-induced apoptosis in HCC cells. Accordingly, simultaneous inhibition of autophagy in HCC cells with CHOP-knockdown could partially resensitize ER stress-induced apoptosis.

40|$|Adipocytic {{conversion}} of 3 T 3 -L 1 cells {{is dependent on}} induction of transcription factors from the C/EBP family that activate promoters of adipogenic genes. We find that expression of CHOP, a nuclear protein that dimerizes avidly with C/EBP isoforms alpha and beta and directs the resulting heterodimer away from classic C/EBP-binding sites, markedly inhibits this differentiation process. Surprisingly, the presence of CHOP early in the differentiation process inhibits C/EBP alpha and beta gene expression. Ectopic expression of C/EBP alpha bypasses the inhibitory effect of CHOP on differentiation, providing further evidence that CHOP action is mediated by inhibition of C/EBP alpha gene expression rather than merely inhibiting the encoded protein's DNA-binding activity. A similar pattern of attenuated expression of C/EBP alpha and beta is also observed in cells induced to differentiate in media with low glucose concentration. This stressed culture condition is associated with induction of endogenous CHOP and marked attenuation of the differentiation process. Our <b>data</b> suggest that <b>CHOP</b> functions as an inducible inhibitor of adipocytic differentiation in response to metabolic stress.

40|$|The human {{pathogen}} Haemophilus influenzae {{has the ability}} to quickly adapt to different host environments through phase variation of multiple structures on its lipooligosaccharide (LPS), including phosphorylcholine (ChoP). During colonization with H. influenzae, there is a selection for ChoP+ phase variants. In a murine model of nasopharyngeal colonization, this selection is lost in the absence of adaptive immunity. Based on previous data highlighting the importance of natural antibody in limiting H. influenzae colonization, the effect of ChoP expression on antibody binding and its bactericidal activity was investigated. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that ChoP+ phase variants had decreased binding of antibody to LPS epitopes compared to ChoP 2 phase variants. This difference in antibody binding correlated with increased survival of ChoP+ phase variants in the presence of antibody-dependent, complement-mediated killing. ChoP+ phase variants were also more resistant to trypsin digestion, suggesting a general effect on the physical properties of the outer membrane. Moreover, ChoP-mediated protection against antibody binding correlated with increased resilience of outer membrane integrity.

Forcible overexpression of CHOP causes apoptosis in keratinocytes in culture. Here, we asked whether CHOP might be {{increased in the}} skin after UVB (280 – 320 nm) exposure, thus implicating CHOP in sunburn cell (SBC) formation. SKH- 1 hairless mice were exposed to a ultraviolet (UV) source (80 mJ per cm 2; ∼ 74 % UVB, ∼ 16 % UVA), and skin biopsies examined by immunohistology and immunoprecipitation. Compared with non-irradiated epidermis, CHOP expression was significantly increased at 30 min, and reached maximal levels by 24 h. Similar increases in CHOP following UVB exposure were observed in human buttock skin. The time course of CHOP expression preceded SBC formation and another marker of apoptosis, caspase- 3 cleavage. Intracellular CHOP accumulated mainly in cytoplasmic and perinuclear locations, with little remaining in the nucleus. To examine mechanisms, cultured keratinocytes were irradiated in vitro and examined by western blotting. Under conditions that eliminated ER stress because of cell handling, CHOP did not accumulate (and was in fact decreased) in the cells. Thus, induction of CHOP in keratinocytes requires factors present only in the native skin.

40|$|Endoplasmic {{reticulum}} (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis is a {{key feature}} of hepatocyte cytotoxicity by saturated free fatty acids (FFA). This lipoapoptosis is dependent, in part, on the transcriptional upregulation of the BH 3 -only protein PUMA (p 53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis). Although the activator protein (AP) - 1 complex facilitates PUMA expression by saturated FFA, the transcription factor CAAT/enhancer binding homologous protein (CHOP) is also induced by ER stress and promotes apoptosis. To integrate the role of these two transcription factors in ER stress-induced apoptosis, we examined the relative contribution of CHOP and AP- 1 in mediating PUMA induction by saturated FFA. Our results demonstrate that short-hairpin RNA-targeted knockdown of CHOP attenuates palmitate-induced apoptosis in Huh- 7 cells. Loss of CHOP induction also reduced the increase in PUMA mRNA and protein levels as well as Bax activation by palmitate. No functional CHOP binding sites were identified in the PUMA promoter sequence. Rather, we observed that CHOP physically interacts with the AP- 1 complex protein c-Jun upon palmitate treatment, and a CHOP:phosphorylated c-Jun heteromeric complex binds to the AP- 1 consensus binding sequence within the PUMA promoter region. Finally, loss of function studies suggest that both transcription factors are necessary for maximal PUMA induction.

It is associated with highly increased risk of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease as well as several cancers. The expansion of the fat tissue needs the differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes, a process called adipogenesis. Dysfunction of adipogenesis is a hallmark of obesity and delineation of underlying mechanisms has high priority for identifying targets for pharmacological intervention. Here we investigate the impact of the COP 9 signalosome (CSN), a regulator of cullin-RINGubiquitin ligases (CRLs), and of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) on the differentiation of LiSa- 2 preadipocytes. CHOP induced by piceatannol or by permanent overexpression in LiSa- 2 cells blocks adipocyte differentiation as characterized by inhibited fat droplet formation and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production. Knockdown of the CSN by permanent downregulation of CSN 1 in LiSa- 2 cells elevates CHOP and retards adipogenesis. The effect of the CSN knockdown on CHOP stability can be explained by the protection of the CRL component Keap 1 by the CSN associated ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP 15). Pulldowns and glycerol gradients reveal that CHOP interacts with a supercomplex consisting of the CSN, cullin 3 and Keap 1.

40|$|Induction of the C/EBP {{homologous}} protein (CHOP) {{is considered a}} key event for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis. Type 1 diabetes (T 1 D) is characterized by an autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta-cells. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are early mediators of beta-cell death in T 1 D. Cytokines induce ER stress and CHOP overexpression in beta-cells, but the role for CHOP overexpression in cytokine-induced beta-cell apoptosis remains controversial. We presently observed that CHOP knockdown (KD) prevents cytokine-mediated degradation of the anti-apoptotic proteins B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl- 2) and myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl- 1), thereby decreasing the cleavage of executioner caspases 9 and 3, and apoptosis. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) is a crucial transcription factor regulating beta-cell apoptosis and inflammation. CHOP KD resulted in reduced cytokine-induced NF-kappa B activity and expression of key NF-kappa B target genes involved in apoptosis and inflammation, including iNOS, FAS, IRF- 7, IL- 15, CCL 5 and CXCL 10. This was due to decreased I kappa B degradation and p 65 translocation to the nucleus. The present <b>data</b> suggest that <b>CHOP</b> has a dual role in promoting beta-cell death: (1) CHOP directly contributes to cytokine-induced beta-cell apoptosis by promoting cytokine-induced mitochondrial pathways of apoptosis; and (2) by supporting the NF-kappa B activation and subsequent cytokine/chemokine expression, CHOP may contribute to apoptosis and the chemo attraction of mononuclear cells to the islets during insulitis.

40|$|Hippocampal {{sclerosis}} is {{a frequent}} pathological finding in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and {{can be caused by}} prolonged single or repeated brief seizures. Both DNA damage and endoplasmic reticulum stress have been implicated as underlying molecular mechanisms in seizure-induced brain injury. The CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) is a transcriptional regulator induced downstream of DNA damage and endoplasmic reticulum stress, which can promote or inhibit apoptosis according to context. Recent work has proposed inhibition of CHOP as a suitable neuroprotective strategy. Here, we show that transcript and protein levels of CHOP increase in surviving subfields of the hippocampus after prolonged seizures (status epilepticus) in mouse models. CHOP was also elevated in the hippocampus from epileptic mice and patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy. The hippocampus of CHOP-deficient mice was much more vulnerable to damage in mouse models of status epilepticus. Moreover, compared with wild-type animals, CHOP-deficient mice subject to status epilepticus developed more spontaneous seizures, displayed protracted hippocampal neurodegeneration and a deficit in a hippocampus-dependent object–place recognition task. The absence of CHOP was associated with a supra-maximal induction of p 53 after status epilepticus, and inhibition of p 53 abolished the cell death-promoting consequences of CHOP deficiency. The protective effect of CHOP could be partly explained by activating transcription of murine double minute 2 that targets p 53 for degradation. These <b>data</b> demonstrate that <b>CHOP</b> is required for neuronal survival after seizures and caution against inhibition of CHOP as a neuroprotective strategy where excitotoxicity is an underlying pathomechanism.
