5|$|From the 1890s onwards, Muller had {{published}} with great regularity {{about the importance}} of a proper Dutch consular service to promote the Dutch mercantile interests around the world. In his articles he forcefully advanced the idea that the consular and <b>diplomatic</b> <b>services</b> should be merged and professionalised. In his publications Muller also strongly propagated a more active role of the Netherlands in international affairs. In this vain, in 1919, he published an article on the history and geography of Spitsbergen (Svalbard) and the necessity for the Dutch government to defend its historic claims on the islands. A year later, the Dutch government became a signatory to the Spitsbergen Treaty.|$|E

25|$|Born in Skeninge in October 1490. Like his elder brother, Sweden's last Catholic {{archbishop}} Johannes Magnus, {{he obtained}} several ecclesiastical preferments. Among them a canonry at Uppsala and Linköping, and the archdeaconry of Strängnäs. He was furthermore employed on various <b>diplomatic</b> <b>services</b> after {{his mission to}} Rome in 1524, on behalf of Gustav I of Sweden (Vasa), to procure the appointment of Olaus Magnus' brother, Johannes Magnus as archbishop of Uppsala. He remained abroad dealing with foreign affairs and {{is known to have}} sent home a document that contained agreed trade-relations with the Netherlands. On the success of the reformation in Sweden, his attachment to the Catholic church led him to stay abroad for good where he accompanied his brother in Poland. They were both exiled and Magnus' Swedish belongings were confiscated in 1530.|$|E

500|$|William the Conqueror {{nominated}} {{him to the}} see of Durham on 9 November 1080, and he was duly consecrated {{on either}} 27 December 1080 or 3 January 1081.

However, it was most likely in recognition of his administrative ability.
