2500|$|Muhammad is {{reported}} to have had mysterious seizures at the moments of inspiration. [...] According to Philip Schaff (1819–93), during his revelations Muhammad [...] "sometimes growled like a camel, foamed at his mouth, and streamed with perspiration." [...] Welch, a scholar of Islamic studies, in the Encyclopedia of Islam states that the graphic descriptions of Muhammad's condition at these moments may be regarded as genuine, since they are unlikely to have been invented by later Muslims. According to Welch, these seizures should have been the most convincing evidence for the superhuman origin of Muhammad's inspirations for people around him. Others adopted alternative explanations for these seizures and claimed that he was possessed, a soothsayer, or a magician. Welch states it remains uncertain whether Muhammad had such experiences before he began to see himself as a prophet and if so <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>did</b> he have such experiences.|$|E
