5|$|St Mary's {{is built}} of ashlar buff and red {{sandstone}} quarried locally at Alderley Edge, and {{the roof is}} of Kerridge stone slates. Its plan consists of a tower at the west end, a four-bay nave with north and south aisles, a chancel with a vestry to its north, and a south porch. Over the north aisle is a <b>dormer</b> <b>window.</b> The tower has diagonal buttresses. Its west door has 14th-century mouldings and above the door is a three-light window. The stage above this contains ringers' windows on {{the north and west}} faces and a diamond-shaped clock on the south face. Above these the belfry windows on all faces have two lights. The top of the tower is embattled and contains the bases of eight pinnacles. Below the parapet is a string course with large grotesque gargoyles. At the west end of the nave roof is a bellcote. The Stanley pew projects to the east of the south porch. In the porch are grooves which were cut where arrows were sharpened.|$|E
25|$|Later, perhaps around 1550, {{a two-part}} <b>dormer</b> <b>window</b> was {{built over the}} wall-walk on the {{northern}} side of the western gallery, breaking the circulation around {{the roof of the}} church, limiting access to the towers.|$|E
25|$|The Judgement {{handed down}} by Commissioner K.G. Hoffman {{stated that the}} Court came to the {{conclusion}} that the heritage significance of the group of terraces and that of No. 28 would be compromised to an unacceptable degree by the proposed roof deck. The court however allowed modified Juliette balconies, an attic room and a <b>dormer</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dormer</b> <b>windows</b> {{have been}} used in {{domestic}} architecture in Britain since the 16th century. <b>Dormer</b> <b>windows</b> were popularised by French architect Francois Mansart, who used dormers extensively in the mansard roofs he designed for 17th-century Paris.|$|R

25|$|The rectory {{was part}} of Withers' {{original}} design, and built along with the church. It is a likewise asymmetrical two-and-a-half-story structure of bluestone walls with brick trim, rebuilt to its original plan after a fire. The south-facing front features a gable and tower; the east elevation has a double gable. The west elevation has a single gabled <b>dormer</b> <b>window</b> with half-timbering. The roof is shingled in asphalt.|$|E
25|$|The Boycott Pavilions {{built of}} stone and {{designed}} by James Gibbs, the eastern one built in 1728 and the western in 1729. They are named after the nearby vanished hamlet of Boycott. Located on the brow of a hill overlooking the river Dad, they flank the Oxford drive. Originally both were {{in the form of}} square planned open belvederes with stone pyramidal roofs. In 1758 the architect Giovanni Battista Borra altered them, replacing them with the lead domes, with a round <b>dormer</b> <b>window</b> in each face and an open roof lantern in the centre. The eastern pavilion was converted into a three storey house in 1952.|$|E
25|$|As well as period rooms, the {{collection}} includes parts of buildings, {{for example the}} two top stories of the facade of Sir Paul Pindar's house dated c1600 from Bishopsgate with elaborately carved wood work and leaded windows, a rare survivor of the Great Fire of London, there is a brick portal from a London house of the English Restoration period and a fireplace from the gallery of Northumberland house. European examples include a <b>dormer</b> <b>window</b> dated 1523–35 from the chateau of Montal. There are several examples from Italian Renaissance buildings including, portals, fireplaces, balconies and a stone buffet that {{used to have a}} built in fountain. The main architecture gallery has a series of pillars from various buildings and different periods, for example a column from the Alhambra. Examples covering Asia are in those galleries concerned with those countries, as well as models and photographs in the main architecture gallery.|$|E

50|$|The steeply {{pitched roof}} of the {{building}} is clad in ribbed aluminium sheeting with three <b>dormer</b> <b>windows</b> on {{the north and south}} sides between the trusses. Where the roof meets the ground, large concrete footings or stormwater drains and planter boxes form the transition. Three triangular roof lights are positioned above the <b>dormer</b> <b>windows</b> at the apex.|$|R
50|$|This {{single-storeyed}} {{brick building}} is T-shaped in plan, with steep gable roofs designed for shingles, and <b>dormer</b> <b>windows</b> {{either side of}} the main roof ridge. The walls are of English bond, and the largely unaltered southwest elevation has corbels and eaves brackets to support the <b>dormer</b> <b>windows,</b> and lancet windows with straight pointed heads set between the corbels.|$|R
500|$|Accordingly, the Board of School Commissioners {{rented a}} townhouse {{structure}} (probably 2 stories with a pitched roof and <b>dormer</b> <b>window</b> as was common in that residential/commercial neighborhood then), 2 blocks {{northwest of the}} [...] Baltimore City/County Courthouse (from 1805, then facing East Lexington Street at North Calvert Street and adjacent to the former colonial era courthouse square with the landmark Battle Monument from the War of 1812, now 25 years past) [...] on a small narrow by-way of what was then called Courtland Street (now {{on the east side}} of Saint Paul Street/Place, now also on the site of the terraced [...] "Preston Gardens" [...] (redeveloped as one of the city's first [...] "urban renewal" [...] in the downtown area in 1913, under Mayor James H. Preston, with the razing of five square blocks north to south from East Lexington Street up to East Centre Street).|$|E
500|$|These three four-storey houses (now the Beach Hotel) have double bow fronts, {{and were}} {{considered}} by Nikolaus Pevsner {{to be more}} austere in their detailing than most Brighton houses of their era. [...] Number 2, a former home of social reformer William King (whose two-year stay is commemorated by a blue plaque), is built of brick which has been painted over; the others are stuccoed. [...] Each house also has a basement and a <b>dormer</b> <b>window.</b> [...] The ground floors are rusticated and have arched doorways set into Classical-style porches with both Ionic and Doric columns—the latter {{in the form of}} antae. [...] The tripartite bay windows are neither full-height nor continuous: only the first three storeys have them, and they are offset to the right on the first and second floors. [...] The first-floor windows sit between a curved cast-iron balcony and a verandah-style canopy supported on decorative brackets. [...] On each house, the third floor has three small flat-arched sash windows; the centre window sits below a small cornice supported on corbels.|$|E
500|$|The {{creation}} of a male high school [...] "in which the higher branches of English and classical literature should be taught exclusively" [...] was authorized unanimously by the Baltimore City Council on March 7, 1839. A townhouse of probably two stories with a sloped roof and <b>dormer</b> <b>window</b> structure on what was then known as Courtland Street (now east side of [...] "Preston Gardens", built in the late 1910s with terraced and bermed flower beds with shrubs and monumental staircases along St. Paul Street and St. Paul Place, of five square blocks between East Centre Street {{in the north and}} East Lexington Street to the south, as Baltimore's first downtown [...] "urban renewal" [...] project, which unfortunately resulted in the razing of hundreds of beautiful, but run-down, then neglected Federal, Georgian, and Greek Revival architecture-styled townhomes and classical business structures that would be considered to be saved under the [...] "historic preservation" [...] standards today) was acquired to serve as the home of the new high school. The school opened its doors that Fall on October 20, 1839 with 46 students. Enrollment was restricted to white, male students of Baltimore City who had completed grammar school and passed an entrance exam. Additional student applicants from the surrounding rural (and later suburban) Baltimore County and Anne Arundel County were considered upon payment of tuition to the Baltimore City Public Schools system [...] Those enrolled were offered two academic tracks, a classical literature track and an English literature track. The sole instructor for both tracks was the educator and poet, Nathan C. Brooks, who also served as principal. To accommodate the two tracks, Brooks split the school day into two sections: one in the morning from 9am to 12am, and another in the afternoon from 2pm to 5pm. During the morning session, students studied either classics or English; however, the afternoon was devoted to English.|$|E

2500|$|The plan {{consists}} of a west tower, a short nave of two bays, wide north and south aisles and a chancel. [...] The tower is relatively large for {{the size of the}} church, with battlements and pinnacles and a four-faced clock dated 1809 made by Thomas Schofield of Manchester. [...] The roofs of the nave and chancel are original and in good condition; the nave roof is camber beam in type and a <b>dormer</b> <b>window</b> has been added to it at a later date. The roofs of the aisles were plastered over in early Georgian times. [...] The style of the architecture is almost entirely Perpendicular.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{many of the}} {{original}} buildings surviving on All Saints Street, the Stag Inn retains its timber-framed structure-although it is hidden behind the mid 18th-century plastered façade. [...] The building, which stands high above the narrow street on a raised pavement, has two storeys and a five-window range. [...] There is also an attic level lit by a straight-headed <b>dormer</b> <b>window.</b> [...] Most windows are sashes and have moulded sills. [...] The gables on the side walls, added in the 18th century, are faced with tiles. [...] A hipped-roofed timber-framed wing with brick walls extends to the rear. [...] In the main section, the twin entrances have straight-headed hood moulds supported on corbels, with panelled doors reached by stone steps with iron handrails. [...] Inside, there are exposed oak beams with decorative mouldings, and the brackets which originally supported the jettied upper storey survive.|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} {{is one of}} the oldest surviving houses in Brighton, and has been called [...] "one of [...] most famous surviving early buildings". Its modest appearance and small size prompted architectural historian Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel, a former resident of Brighton, to call it [...] "as charming a relic of ... Brighthelmstone [...] as anyone could wish to see". It is a three-storey building with a modern shopfront on the lowest floor, two storeys in residential use above, and a large hipped roof with dormer windows. The top two floors are laid with black glazed mathematical tiles—often used in the 18th and 19th centuries on buildings in Brighton, and a characteristic feature of the local architecture. The second and third storeys also have canted bay windows; to the sides and rear (facing an ancient alleyway), original sash windows remain. The left <b>dormer</b> <b>window</b> is a casement, while the right has a sash window.|$|E

2500|$|The spy {{remained}} behind, {{too frightened}} {{of the consequences}} if he were caught escaping with the others. Casanova and Balbi pried {{their way through the}} lead plates and onto the sloping roof of the Doge's Palace, with a heavy fog swirling. The drop to the nearby canal being too great, Casanova prised open the grate over a <b>dormer</b> <b>window,</b> and broke the window to gain entry. They found a long ladder on the roof, and with the additional use of a bedsheet [...] "rope" [...] that Casanova had prepared, lowered themselves into the room whose floor was twenty-five feet below. They rested until morning, changed clothes, then broke a small lock on an exit door and passed into a palace corridor, through galleries and chambers, and down stairs, where by convincing the guard they had inadvertently been locked into the palace after an official function, they left through a final door. It was six in the morning and they escaped by gondola. Eventually, Casanova reached Paris, where he arrived on the same day (January 5, 1757) that Robert-François Damiens made an attempt on the life of Louis XV. (Casanova would later witness and describe his execution.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The city's main {{fire station}} faces the five-road {{junction}} of Preston Circus, near London Road viaduct. [...] Established {{on the site}} of a brewery of 1901, the building was redesigned in 1938; Graeme Highet won the commission in competition. [...] His plain brick exterior, curving gently round the road, combines [...] "restrained Modernism" [...] with more old-fashioned elements such as a canopied entrance and windows with prominent architraves. [...] Sculptor Joseph Cribb provided carved reliefs for the main doors. Portslade's former fire station operated from 1909 until about 1941 and passed into commercial use in 1972. District Surveyor A. Taylor Allen's design was built by Ernest Clevett. [...] The [...] "attractive-looking building" [...] is of white brick and terracotta, and is surrounded by a wall with a multi-coloured brick pier supporting a large gas lamp. [...] There are decorative terracotta plaques and a gabled <b>dormer</b> <b>window</b> with terracotta finials. In 1914, Hove Council took responsibility for firefighting within its boundaries and immediately sought a replacement for the existing fire station of 1879 in George Street. [...] Clayton & Black's [...] "elegant" [...] new fire station on Hove Street, completed in 1929 at a cost of £11,098, was inspired by one at Bromley—but the [...] "charming bellcote" [...] on the roof was a reference to the nearby Hove Manor, demolished soon afterwards. [...] The façade had a double archway. [...] The building became redundant in 1976 and was converted into flats in 1981 by architect Denis Hawes.|$|E
2500|$|Tower House, [...] "Brighton's finest {{example of}} a grand Edwardian house", is an [...] "imposing and richly detailed" [...] {{building}} which—despite being set back from the main London Road—forms a local landmark due to its tall corner tower with a large lead cupola. [...] This has ogee curves and sits {{on top of an}} octagonal timber roof lantern. [...] The house is constructed of red brick in the Edwardian/Queen Anne Revival style. [...] It rises to 3–4 storeys and has a six-window range. [...] The four-storey tower at the south corner is recessed; the main building has a symmetrical façade composed of two projecting gabled wings with two-storey bay windows and a central recessed three-bay entrance wing. [...] This has a porch {{in the form of a}} three-arched arcade, above which projects a wooden balcony. [...] On the roof between the gables is a small <b>dormer</b> <b>window</b> with a curved gable on which is painted the year 1902 and the Savage family's monogram. [...] Further back on the south side is a gabled single-storey conservatory. [...] To the rear are another two gabled wings, the gables tile-hung and with cornices. [...] There is also a wide ironwork veranda. [...] Some original features survive inside, including an arched fireplace, decorative panelling and a Doric-columned arcade, but the central divided staircase and a stained glass ceiling which illuminated the entrance hall were removed during the renovations of 1988.|$|E
