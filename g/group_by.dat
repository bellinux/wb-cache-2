5|$|Acting {{on reports}} from airmen {{that there were}} no signs of enemy {{activity}} and the islands might have been evacuated, General Douglas MacArthur accelerated his timetable for capturing the Admiralties and ordered an immediate reconnaissance in force. The campaign began on 29February 1944 when a force landed on Los Negros, the third-largest island in the <b>group.</b> <b>By</b> using a small, isolated beach where the Japanese had not anticipated an assault, the force achieved tactical surprise, but the islands proved to be far from unoccupied. A furious battle over the islands ensued.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} leading {{theories}} (e. g., Grossberg & Mingolla, 1985; Kellman & Shipley, 1991; Rensink & Enns, 1995) commonly assume that perceptual <b>grouping</b> <b>by</b> contour alignment occurs preattentively across reversing contrast polarity elements. We examined this notion in seven visual search experiments. We {{found that only}} <b>grouping</b> <b>by</b> attachment supported preattentive visual search and that <b>grouping</b> <b>by</b> contour alignment required attention in order to operate. Both attachment <b>grouping</b> and <b>grouping</b> <b>by</b> contour alignment were sensitive to contrast reversals. Further results showed that contour alignment was a strong grouping cue only among elements with the same contrast sign but {{that it did not}} facilitate grouping across reversing contrast. These results suggest that <b>grouping</b> <b>by</b> contour alignment operates only on inputs of consistent contrast polarity. © 2009 The Psychonomic Society, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|Amino acids {{are either}} used to {{synthesize}} proteins and other biomolecules, or oxidized to urea {{and carbon dioxide}} {{as a source of}} energy. The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino <b>group</b> <b>by</b> a transaminase. The amino group is fed into the urea cycle, leaving a deaminated carbon skeleton {{in the form of a}} keto acid. Several of these keto acids are intermediates in the citric acid cycle, for example the deamination of glutamate forms α-ketoglutarate. The glucogenic amino acids can also be converted into glucose, through gluconeogenesis (discussed below).|$|E
5|$|An animal epithet {{is a name}} used {{to label}} a person or <b>group,</b> <b>by</b> {{association}} with some perceived quality of an animal. Epithets may be formulated as similes, explicitly comparing people with the named animal, or as metaphors, directly naming people as animals. Animal epithets may be pejorative, readily giving offence, and they are sometimes used in political campaigns. One English epithet, lamb, is always used positively.|$|E

5|$|Costly {{religious}} rituals such as male circumcision, {{food and}} water deprivation, and snake handling look paradoxical in evolutionary terms. Devout religious beliefs wherein such traditions are practiced therefore appear maladaptive. Religion may have arisen to increase and maintain intragroup cooperation. Cooperation leads to altruistic behaviour, and costly signalling could explain this. All religions may involve costly and elaborate rituals, performed publicly, to demonstrate loyalty to the religious group. In this way, group members increase their allegiance to the <b>group</b> <b>by</b> signalling their investment in group interests. However, as group size increases among humans, the threat of free riders grows. Costly signalling theory accounts for this by proposing that these religious rituals are costly enough to deter free riders.|$|E
5|$|During {{the fifth}} season, the Syndicate {{discovered}} that Covarrubias had betrayed them and was providing information to Mulder. Covarrubias was infected with black oil during her {{betrayal of the}} Syndicate, and Syndicate scientists used her to test a vaccine they had been working to create. While the Syndicate-developed vaccine proves ineffective, Covarrubias' infection is ultimately cured by an effective vaccine stolen from a Russian shadow-government <b>group</b> <b>by</b> Alex Krycek. In the following season, Covarrubias is discovered by FBI agent Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) at a decontamination chamber. She begs him to help her escape the facility, addressing him by name as well as giving him information about the whereabouts of his mother, Cassandra. Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), a former Syndicate agent now acting alone, is also present at the facility. He declines to help the pair, and leaves Covarrubias for dead.|$|E

5|$|Following the RPF victory, {{approximately}} two million Hutu fled to {{refugee camps in}} neighboring countries, particularly Zaire, fearing RPF reprisals for the Rwandan Genocide. The camps were {{set up by the}} United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), but were effectively controlled by the army and government of the former Hutu regime, including many leaders of the genocide. This regime was determined to return to power in Rwanda and began rearming, killing Tutsi residing in Zaire, and launching cross-border incursions in conjunction with the Interahamwe paramilitary <b>group.</b> <b>By</b> late 1996, the Hutu militants represented a serious threat to the new Rwandan regime, and Kagame launched a counteroffensive.|$|E
