40|$|A new {{technology}} of processing raw materials {{with the use}} of active alkali is suggested for bauxites of the Srednetimanskoe deposit; bauxite is opened at 300 °C for 1 h. This technology makes it possible to increase the recovery of alumina to 94 - 98 % and obtain red slimes and zeolite enriched with iron (58 %) and titanium (4. 8 %); the environmental problem of storing red slimes is resolved. The blast-furnace smelting of such slimes makes it possible to obtain naturally doped cast iron and slag enriched with titanium and rare earth metals. When purifying (<b>desiliconizing)</b> the aluminate solution, a valuable product-sodium aluminum silicate hydrate of the zeolite type-is incidentally obtained. © 2013 Allerton Press, Inc...|$|E
