The <b>inner</b> <b>bottom,</b> subdivided into 35 watertight compartments, extended from the keel to the protective deck at each side and fore and aft to the knuckle of the keel. Underwater protection was further increased by continuing this subdivision up the complete side of the subsurface hull to the lower edge of the armored deck slopes. Twenty-eight electrically operated Long-Arm watertight doors and five armored hatches helped maintain watertight integrity beneath the armored deck.|$|E

For the fifth instar, the strains ARSEF 6430, 6433 and 6432 showed similar virulence with LT 50 of 2. 6, 2. 6 and 3. 2 days, respectively.

500|$|The Sovetsky Soyuz-class ships {{devoted a}} total weight of [...] to armor protection, a {{slightly}} greater weight {{than that of}} the larger Japanese Yamato class (...) [...] Their armor was intended to resist 406mm shells and 500kg bombs, specifically shells fired from forward bearings between 35° and 50° from the centerline. This led to the very unusual situation where the armor belt thickened toward the bow to compensate for the narrowing of the ship near the forward magazines, which had to be compensated for by thicker armor. The belt was [...] long and covered 57% of the total waterline length. It was inclined 5° to increase its resistance to flat-trajectory shells. Over the machinery spaces it was [...] thick and increased in steps until it was [...] thick over the forward magazines. It was [...] over the rear magazine. The belt armor was carried forward of the magazines at a thickness of [...] and terminated in a steeply sloped (30°) transverse [...] bulkhead that reduced to [...] at the lower deck where it was continued down to the <b>inner</b> <b>bottom</b> by a [...] bulkhead. Forward of this bulkhead was a 20mm splinter belt that continued {{all the way to the}} bow. The main armor belt dropped down to the main deck from the upper deck abreast the aft turret to reduce weight. This [...] "step" [...] was protected by [...] plates. A [...] transverse bulkhead separated the rear turret and the ship's sides.

40|$|The present paper {{explores the}} {{implementation}} of a light-duct in order to equalise daylight distribution in an office space. While the illuminance level near windows in a building tends to be higher than that necessary for the working environment, artificial lighting is often used to ensure that the workspace further away from the windows has the required level of illuminance. Equalising daylight distribution from the periphery to the inner part would thus provide signifi cant advantages for energy-efficient lighting as well as the fl exible and efficient use of offi ce space. In order to achieve this goal, anti-glare devices in the perimeter zone such as louvers and daylight distribution devices such as light-ducts are required. In this paper, we focus on light-ducts in the first instance, with an emphasis on their two key components for controlling the direction of daylight, namely <b>inner</b> reflectors and <b>bottom</b> extractors...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} sediments along a 3 S-mile {{length of the}} Florida reef tract {{indicates}} the presence of two sub-environments between the reefs and the Keys. Variational trends of mean phi, standard eviation, percent fines (less than 62 microns), roundness, and constituent composition indicate a distinct change in the sediment at a point about half-way between the reefs and the Keys. Trends show a general increase or decrease in the outer (reefward) one-half, but general uniformity within the <b>inner</b> one-half. <b>Bottom</b> observations indicate a correlation between {{the area in which}} the change in sediment takes place, and the area in which density of growth of marine grass increases. Analysis of the sediments and the processes affecting them indicates that marine grasses not only modify the effect of current and cause the entrapment of fine sediment, but they also exert an indirect control on processes of skeletal breakdown and textural evolution of the sediment. For instance, in the outer (reefward) area, skeletal breakdown is dominantly a mechanical • rocess and the sediment textures at least partially reflect current phenomena. In the inner (Keyward) area, owever, skeletal breakdown isdominantly a biological process and the ultimate texture of the sediment reflects a complex of processes including those associated with growth and the life cycle of the organisms, the reaction of the shell carbonate to breakdown, and transport of fine sediment from the outer area. Of particular importance are the relative rates at which these processes take place; the variability of these rates strongly influences textur...|$|R
