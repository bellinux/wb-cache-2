40|$|We {{construct}} a bilateral trade model incorporating two physical goods and a financial asset (<b>inside</b> <b>money)</b> {{to discuss the}} optimal trade policy that countries would choose to maximize their respective utilities. In this Nash tariff game, the trade of physical commodities only occurs geographically across countries, and the trade of <b>inside</b> <b>money</b> allows for intertemporal allocation of consumptions. When the preferences, present and future endowments for each country are given, according to our numerical analysis, trade surplus or deficit (<b>inside</b> <b>money)</b> and optimal tariff rates are endogenously determined when general equilibrium conditions hold. One country may purchase <b>inside</b> <b>money</b> to shift current consumption to the future, and the other {{may be willing to}} issue <b>inside</b> <b>money</b> for smoothing its consumptions in two periods. This imbalance trade contradicts traditional trade models which imply a balanced trade policy.

This distortion is present even if we introduce lending and government money. In fact, we show that lending is complementary to, rather than a substitute for, inside and outside money.

40|$|Abstract: The {{process of}} payment is {{fundamental}} to exchange in a decentralized economy. In production economies, payments often {{take the form of}} transfers of <b>inside</b> <b>money,</b> i. e., specialized forms of debt. Associated with each type of <b>inside</b> <b>money</b> is a set of rules that governs both the legitimacy of such transfers as means of extinguishing other debts, and the allocation of the ensuing risks. In this paper the authors develop a model of debt as <b>inside</b> <b>money.</b> They focus on an historically important form of payment: ânegotiable instruments â such as the bill of exchange. In a simple mechanism design framework the authors show the advantages of transferable debt over simple chains of credit. The model is then extended to encompass other aspects of negotiability, including âendorsement â and the rights of a âholder in due course. â JEL classification: E 400, G 200, K 20...|$|E
40|$|According to the Irving Fisherâs equation, MV = PY, the {{stability}} of economy can be provided via increasing the money supply as well as accelerating the circulation of money. Typically, the monetary policy which control over the MS is done by changing {{the total amount of}} outside money such as reserve requirement control, and the increase in money circulation is provided by function of <b>inside</b> <b>money.</b> Even though <b>inside</b> <b>money</b> does not contain certain characteristics of outside money such as unit of account and face value, the significant reason for the existence of <b>inside</b> <b>money</b> is to play a role as providing liquidity or velocity to the financial market as means of payment. Until Britain introduced the concept of securitization of the long-term debt in 1695, the debasement and changing the assigned value of the coins was the only monetary policy that the government provided. By examining the history of the velocity of money, we might able to find a solution which is applicable to the illiquid secondary or mortgage market causing todayâs financial crisis. In this paper, we will first examine the situation where the coinage as outside money is an only provider of liquidity. Then, observe the bill of exchange in section two as <b>inside</b> <b>money</b> creates the velocity, followed by its limitation. Section three introduces scenario where outside money changes its form from coins to paper/fiat money and the risk of hyperinflatable currency. Advanced use of <b>inside</b> <b>money,</b> which French failed to control, is illustrated in section four. Lastly, using the points from the British system, we will expand previously stated ideas in order {{to figure out how to}} increase the velocity in todayâs secondary market...|$|E
