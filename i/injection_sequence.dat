50|$|When {{starting}} from cold, the engine's combustion efficiency is reduced because the cold engine block draws heat {{out of the}} cylinder in the compression stroke. The result is that fuel is not burned fully, resulting in blue and white smoke and lower power outputs until the engine has warmed. This is especially the case with indirect injection engines, which are less thermally efficient. With electronic injection, the timing and length of the <b>injection</b> <b>sequence</b> can be altered to compensate for this. Older engines with mechanical injection can have mechanical and hydraulic governor control to alter the timing, and multi-phase electrically controlled glow plugs, that stay on for a period after start-up to ensure clean combustion; the plugs are automatically switched to a lower power to prevent their burning out.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe present {{contribution}} {{deals with}} the use of unmodified commercial equipment for cross-correlation capillary electrophoresis (CE). Complex injection sequences have been injected by switching sample and background electrolyte vials according to a preprogrammed order. Because {{of the nature of the}} auto-sampler used, no sequence could be injected in commercial instrument without high voltage (HV) interruptions.

The influence of <b>injection</b> <b>sequences,</b> <b>injection</b> pressure and gas conditions on the heat transfer between the combusting spray and the wall was investigated by measuring the flame temperature during the complete injection event. The flame temperature was measured by an emission based optical method and determined by comparing the relative emission intensities from the soot in the flame at two wavelength intervals. The measurements were done by employing a monochromatic and non intensified high speed camera, an array of mirrors, interference filters and a beam splitter. The {{studies were carried out}} in the Chalmers High Pressure High Temperature (HP/HT) spray rig at conditions similar to those prevailing in a direct injected diesel engine prior to the injection of fuel. Fuel was injected into the combustion chamber by a common rail system using an injector with a single hole nozzle. The combusting spray impinged on a wall whose temperature was similar to the combustion chamber gas temperature. Results of these experiments show variations in the flame temperature {{as a consequence of the}} {{interaction between}} the combusting spray and the wall.

40|$|NoIn {{previous}} {{reports of}} microemulsion electrokinetic chromatography (MEEKC), analysis times were typically {{in the order}} of 10 min as high-ionic strength buffers were used. These buffers produced high currents which limit the voltages which can be applied, therefore, analysis times could not be reduced. The primary cause of the high-ionic strength is the relatively high concentrations of surfactants required to form the microemulsion. The surfactant concentration can be lower when using an oil with a smaller surface tension. This preliminary study showed that migration times in MEEKC can be reduced to below 1 min by using a combination of an optimum microemulsion composition, high voltage, high temperature, short capillaries by injecting via the short end, or by simultaneously applying pressure and voltage. Long <b>injection</b> <b>sequences</b> and quantitation were found to be possible with minimum buffer depletion effects...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the central}} tasks of {{networking}} is packet-routing when edge bandwidth is limited. Tremendous progress has been achieved by separating the issue of routing into two conceptual sub-problems: path selection and congestion resolution along the selected paths. However, this conceptual separation has a serious drawback: each packet's path is fixed at the source and cannot be modified adaptively en-route when traffic conditions change. The problem is especially severe when packet insertions are modeled by an adversary, whose goal is to cause "traffic-jams". In this paper, we consider this adversarial setting, motivated by the "adversarial queuing theory model" of Borodin et al. [BKR+].

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{multiple}} injections on engine-out emissions from a high-speed direct injection (HSDI) diesel engine were investigated {{in a series}} of experiments using a single cylinder research engine. <b>Injection</b> <b>sequences</b> in which the main injection was split into two, three and four pulses were tested and the resulting emissions (NOx, CO HC and particulate matter), torque and cylinder pressures were compared to those obtained with single injections. Together with the number of injections, the effects of varying the dwell time were also investigated. It was found that dividing the main injection into two parts lowered the engine-out particulate and CO emissions and increased fuel efficiency. However, it also resulted in increased NOx emissions. Further, using double injections reduced the peak rate of heat release (RoHR) and increased RoHR in the later stages of the combustion without changing the combustion duration, resulting in a more even distribution of RoHR during the combustion, which {{is believed to be the}} main reason for the changes in fuel consumption and engine-out emission levels.

Hadamard transformations, a matrix based multiplexing technique, when coupled with a capillary electrophoresis instrument capable of rapid sample injection, provides a means to semi-continuously inject samples. The multiple injections separate, interpenetrate, and are detected as the summation of the multiple injections. Deconvolution of the multiplexed signal by multiplication with the inverse of the injection matrix yields a single injection electropherogram that exhibits improved S/N. In modified Hadamard transform capillary electrophoresis (mHTCE), an <b>injection</b> <b>sequence</b> of half the length as conventional HTCE (cHTCE) is utilized. Modifying {{the manner in which the}} raw data is manipulated before deconvolution facilitates the reduced <b>injection</b> <b>sequence.</b> When coupled with software, mHTCE can reduce the collection time for a Hadamard sequence by up to 48 %. The substantial time reduction afforded by mHTCE is utilized to demonstrate the first time-resolved application of Hadamard transformations for the analysis of neurotransmitters. Additionally, mHTCE has been demonstrated as a means to improve the sensitivity for analysis of amino acids and proteins including gamma-aminobutyric acid, dopamine, and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) with picomolar detection limits. Part II. Two-photon excitation provides a means to activate chemical and physical processes with high spatial resolution and improved depth penetration compared to one-photon excitation.

Pumped Storage Hydroelectricity (PSH) is an efficient technology to store and release electricity. However, the development of new PSH plants is limited by environmental and topographic constraints. An innovative alternative consists in using old underground mines as lower reservoirs of Underground Pumped Storage Hydroelectricity (UPSH) plants. In this configuration, large amount of water is pumped and injected in underground cavities and these cyclic stresses impact the groundwater system. A hybrid 3 D finite element mixing cell method is used to numerically simulate the use of an UPSH facility, {{in the case of an}} abandoned slate mine. Different scenarios are computed with varying pumping injection time-sequences. In order to assess the impact on the surrounding groundwater conditions, the resulting head evolution in the cavity and at different distances is analyzed in terms of groundwater oscillation magnitude, drawdown, and seepage into the cavity. Results show clearly the influence of the pumping injection time-sequence (rates, regularity, timing and duration of no-activity periods) on the actual head evolution in the surrounding medium and consequently on the magnitude of interactions with the cavity. For a given hydraulic conductivity of the surrounding medium (i. e. slates in this case study), the main conclusion is that the resulting interaction seepage flows (in and out of the cavity) are highly dependent on the chosen pumping <b>injection</b> <b>sequences.</b> The future impact of UPSH operation must be assessed taking this fact into account.

The average rate of heat release and work output increased and the work variability decreased for both fuels with multiple injections of fuel for both engine loads.

Scaling studies using the new data of this year show a strong dependence of confinement on upper triangularity, density and proximity to the Greenwald limit. Observed MHD instabilities and methods to avoid these in high density and high confinement plasmas are discussed. © 2001 IOP Publishing Ltd. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Under the {{constraints}} of high temperature and heterogeneity, the common profile control agent can not effec-tively plug the steam channeling. To address this issue, {{it is necessary to}} develop the high temperature resistance steam channeling plugging agent to improve the steam suction profile in the heavy oil reservoir. This paper used Simple Vari-able Method to optimize the content of the components of the high temperature resistant plugging agent. Static perform-ances evaluation aims to study the influence rules of the formation condition (temperature, salinity and pH value). Dy-namic evaluation is used to study its performance (plugging ratio, residual resistance factor, scouring resistance and ther-mal stability) in the sand-filled pipe to testify its applicability. The ratio of the component and the <b>injection</b> <b>sequence</b> are shown as follows: 0. 03 % coagulant + 2. 2 % cross-linking agent I + 1. 2 % cross-linking II + 6 % high efficient main agent. The evaluation experiment results show that the gel can resist at least 280 oC, the plugging ratio is above 93. 1 %. The plug-ging ratio only have a 8. 43 % reduction after scoured by 15 PV steam (280 oC). After a 10 -day thermal stability experiment (280 oC), the plugging ratio is still above 80 %. The result indicated that the plugging agent is suitable for the improvement of steam suction profile. The suggested way of injection is also provided...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{describes}} a dependability evaluation method based on fault injection that establishes {{the link between}} the experimental evaluation of the fault tolerance process and the fault occurrence process. The main characteristics of a fault <b>injection</b> test <b>sequence</b> aimed at evaluating the coverage of the fault tolerance process are presented. Emphasis is given to the derivation of experimental measures. The various steps by which the fault occurrence and fault tolerance processes are combined to evaluate dependability measures are identified and their inter-actions are analyzed. The method is illustrated by an application to the dependability evaluation of the distributed fault-tolerant architecture of the ESPRIT Delta- 4 Project.

40|$|Subacromial steroid {{injection}} {{may provide}} a small, short-term benefit compared with placebo. The short-term effectiveness of steroid injection compared with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) remains unclear. Steroid injections are better than physiotherapy alone in the short term. However, injection {{does not appear to}} provide any meaningful long-term benefit compared with other therapies (strength of recommendation: B). Data are insufficient to make recommendations regarding the proper timing of <b>injection</b> in the <b>sequence</b> of other treatments. Side effects of steroid injection, such as steroid flare and infection, are rare...|$|R
