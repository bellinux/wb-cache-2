5|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} found with Nasodigitoacoustic syndrome {{can be managed}} or treated. Sensorineural hearing loss in humans {{may be caused by}} a loss of <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> (sensory receptors in the inner ear that are associated with hearing). This can be hereditary and/or within a syndrome, {{as is the case with}} nasodigitoacoustic syndrome, or attributed to infections such as viruses. For the management of sensorineural hearing loss, hearing aids have been used. Treatments, depending upon the cause and severity, may include a pharmacological approach (i.e., the use of certain steroids), or surgical intervention, like a cochlear implant.|$|E
5|$|The bony {{labyrinth}} {{refers to}} the bony compartment which contains the membranous labyrinth, contained within the temporal bone. The inner ear structurally begins at the oval window, which receives vibrations from the incus of the middle ear. Vibrations are transmitted into the inner ear into a fluid called endolymph, which fills the membranous labyrinth. The endolymph is situated in two vestibules, the utricle and saccule, and eventually transmits to the cochlea, a spiral-shaped structure. The cochlea consists of three fluid-filled spaces: the vestibular duct, the cochlear duct, and the tympanic duct. <b>Hair</b> <b>cells</b> responsible for transduction—changing mechanical changes into electrical stimuli {{are present in the}} organ of Corti in the cochlea.|$|E

Seven- to 10 -day-old chicks were treated with either a single injection of gentamicin (250 mg/kg) or noise [1500 Hz at 120 dB sound pressure level for 14 hours). A subset of the gentamicin- and noise-treated animals also received chloramphenicol [1200 mg/kg during a 24 -hour period] through a subcutaneous osmotic pump. A control group received chloramphenicol alone [1200 mg/kg during a 24 -hour period]. All animals were sacrificed after 5 days, and their basilar papillae (cochleas] were prepared for scanning electron microscopy. <b>Hair</b> <b>cell</b> loss was quantified with stereologic techniques.

5|$|There are two {{principal}} damage mechanisms {{to the inner}} ear in industrialised society, and both injure <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> The first is exposure to elevated sound levels (noise trauma), {{and the second is}} exposure to drugs and other substances (ototoxicity). A large number of people are exposed to sound levels on a daily basis that are likely to lead to significant hearing loss. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has recently published research on the estimated numbers of persons with hearing difficulty (11%) and the percentage of those that can be attributed to occupational noise exposure (24%). Furthermore, according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), approximately twenty-two million (17%) US workers reported exposure to hazardous workplace noise. Workers exposed to hazardous noise further exacerbate the potential for developing noise-induced hearing loss when they do not wear hearing protection.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{can hear}} {{both in the}} air and below water. They do not have {{external}} ears; the eardrums (tympanic membranes) are directly exposed or may be covered by a layer of skin and are visible as a circular area just behind the eye. The size and distance apart of the eardrums is related to the frequency and wavelength at which the frog calls. In some species such as the bullfrog, the size of the tympanum indicates the sex of the frog; males have tympani that are larger than their eyes while in females, the eyes and tympani are much the same size. A noise causes the tympanum to vibrate and the sound is transmitted to the middle and inner ear. The middle ear contains semicircular canals which help control balance and orientation. In the inner ear, the auditory <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> are arranged in two areas of the cochlea, the basilar papilla and the amphibian papilla. The former detects high frequencies and the latter low frequencies. Because the cochlea is short, frogs use electrical tuning to extend their range of audible frequencies and help discriminate different sounds. This arrangement enables detection of the territorial and breeding calls of their conspecifics. In some species that inhabit arid regions, the sound of thunder or heavy rain may arouse them from a dormant state. A frog may be startled by an unexpected noise but it will not usually take any action until it has located the source of the sound by sight.|$|E

The inner <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> provide the main neural output of the cochlea. The outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> instead, mainly receive neural input from the brain, which influences their motility as part of the cochlea's mechanical pre-amplifier.

Scanning electron microscopy was used to quantify <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> density longitudinally during regeneration in three different utricular macula locations, including the striola, central and peripheral regions. The utricular epithelium was void of stereocilia (indicating <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> loss) at 4 days after intraotic treatment with streptomycin. At 2 weeks the stereocilia began to appear randomly and mostly in an immature form. However, when present most kinocilia were polarized toward the developing striola.

25|$|Movement {{of fluid}} in the semicircular canals signals the brain about the {{direction}} and speed of rotation of the head – for example, whether we are nodding our head up and down or looking from right to left. Each semicircular canal has a bulbed end, or enlarged portion, that contains <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Rotation of the head causes a flow of fluid, which in turn causes displacement of the top portion of the <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> that are embedded in the jelly-like cupula. Two other organs {{that are part of}} the vestibular system are the utricle and saccule. These are called the otolithic organs and are responsible for detecting linear acceleration, or movement in a straight line. The <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> of the otolithic organs are blanketed with a jelly-like layer studded with tiny calcium stones called otoconia. When the head is tilted or the body position is changed with respect to gravity, the displacement of the stones causes the <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> to bend.|$|E
40|$|Wnt {{signaling}} is {{a highly}} conserved pathway crucial for development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. Secreted Wnt ligands bind Frizzled receptors to regulate diverse processes such as axis patterning, cell division, and cell fate specification. They also serve to govern self-renewal of somatic stem cells in several adult tissues. The complexity of the pathway {{can be attributed to}} the myriad of Wnt and Frizzled combinations as well as its diverse context-dependent functions. In the developing mouse inner ear, Wnt signaling plays diverse roles, including specification of the otic placode and patterning of the otic vesicle. At later stages, its activity governs sensory <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> specification, cell cycle regulation, and <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> orientation.

40|$|AbstractThe Mongolian gerbil, Meriones unguiculatus, {{has been}} widely {{employed}} {{as a model for}} studies of the inner ear. In spite of its established use for auditory research, no robust protocols to induce ototoxic <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> damage have been developed for this species. In this paper, we demonstrate the development of an aminoglycoside-induced model of <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> loss, using kanamycin potentiated by the loop diuretic furosemide. Interestingly, we show that the gerbil is relatively insensitive to gentamicin compared to kanamycin, and that bumetanide is ineffective in potentiating the ototoxicity of the drug. We also examine the pathology of the spiral ganglion after chronic, long-term <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> damage. Remarkably, {{there is little or no}} neuronal loss following the ototoxic insult, even at 8 months post-damage. This is similar to the situation often seen in the human, where functioning neurons can persist even decades after <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> loss, contrasting with the rapid, secondary degeneration found in rats, mice and other small mammals. We propose that the combination of these factors makes the gerbil a good model for ototoxic damage by induced <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> loss...|$|R

In this study, we investigated three FDA-approved histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (vorinostat/SAHA, belinostat, and panobinostat) as protectants against aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity in murine cochlear explants and in vivo in both guinea pigs and CBA/J mice.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model of cochlear processing is developed {{to account for}} the nonlinear dependence of frequency selectivity on intensity in inner <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> and auditory nerve fiber responses. The model describes the transformation from acoustic stimulus to intracellular <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> potentials in the cochlea.

The analysis at this stage is restricted to low-frequency single tones. The computed responses to single tone inputs exhibit the experimentally observed nonlinear effects of increasing intensity such as the increase in the bandwidth of frequency selectivity and the downward shift of the best frequency. In the model, the first effect is primarily due to the saturating effect of the <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> nonlinearity.

Retinoblastoma proteins suppress cell growth by preventing cells from returning to the cell cycle, thereby preventing proliferation. Inhibiting the activity of Rb seems to allow cells to divide.

The lateral-line system is very sensitive to changes in water currents and vibration in the water.
