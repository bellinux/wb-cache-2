5|$|Closely {{related to}} light {{deflection}} is the <b>gravitational</b> time delay (or Shapiro delay), the phenomenon that light signals {{take longer to}} move through a <b>gravitational</b> field than they would {{in the absence of}} that field. There have been numerous successful tests of this prediction. In the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism (PPN), measurements of both the deflection of light and the <b>gravitational</b> time delay determine a parameter called γ, which encodes the influence of gravity on the geometry of space.|$|E
5|$|Ehlers' {{research}} {{was in the}} field of general relativity. In particular, he made contributions to cosmology, the theory of <b>gravitational</b> lenses and <b>gravitational</b> waves. His principal concern was to clarify general relativity's mathematical structure and its consequences, separating rigorous proofs from heuristic conjectures.|$|E
5|$|Experiments and {{observations}} show that Einstein's description of gravitation accounts for several effects that are unexplained by Newton's law, such as minute anomalies in {{the orbits of}} Mercury and other planets. General relativity also predicts novel effects of gravity, such as <b>gravitational</b> waves, <b>gravitational</b> lensing and an effect of gravity on time known as <b>gravitational</b> time dilation. Many of these predictions have been confirmed by experiment or observation, most recently <b>gravitational</b> waves.|$|E
5|$|Future <b>gravitational</b> waves {{observatories}} {{might be}} able to detect primordial <b>gravitational</b> waves, relics of the early universe, up to less than a second after the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gravitational</b> {{redshift}} {{has been}} {{measured in the}} laboratory and using astronomical observations. <b>Gravitational</b> time dilation in the Earth's <b>gravitational</b> field has been measured numerous times using atomic clocks, while ongoing validation is provided as {{a side effect of}} the operation of the Global Positioning System (GPS). Tests in stronger <b>gravitational</b> fields are provided by the observation of binary pulsars. All results are in agreement with general relativity. However, at the current level of accuracy, these observations cannot distinguish between general relativity and other theories in which the equivalence principle is valid.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational-wave {{astronomy}} is {{an emerging}} field of astronomy that employs gravitational-wave detectors to collect observational data about distant massive objects. A few observatories have been constructed, {{such as the}} Laser Interferometer <b>Gravitational</b> Observatory LIGO. LIGO made its first detection on 14 September 2015, observing <b>gravitational</b> waves from a binary black hole. A second <b>gravitational</b> wave was detected on 26 December 2015 and additional observations should continue but <b>gravitational</b> waves require extremely sensitive instruments.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Einstein {{predicted}} <b>gravitational</b> waves, ripples in {{the curvature}} of spacetime which propagate as waves, traveling {{outward from the}} source, transporting energy as <b>gravitational</b> radiation. The existence of <b>gravitational</b> waves is possible under general relativity due to its Lorentz invariance which brings {{the concept of a}} finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it. By contrast, <b>gravitational</b> waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.|$|E
5|$|Since photons {{contribute}} to the stress–energy tensor, they exert a <b>gravitational</b> attraction on other objects, according {{to the theory of}} general relativity. Conversely, photons are themselves affected by gravity; their normally straight trajectories may be bent by warped spacetime, as in <b>gravitational</b> lensing, and their frequencies may be lowered by moving to a higher <b>gravitational</b> potential, as in the Pound–Rebka experiment. However, these effects are not specific to photons; exactly the same effects would be predicted for classical electromagnetic waves.|$|E
5|$|Some exact {{solutions}} describe <b>gravitational</b> waves {{without any}} approximation, e.g., a wave train traveling through empty space or Gowdy universes, varieties of an expanding cosmos filled with <b>gravitational</b> waves. But for <b>gravitational</b> waves produced in astrophysically relevant situations, {{such as the}} merger of two black holes, numerical methods are presently {{the only way to}} construct appropriate models.|$|E
5|$|Some {{predictions}} {{of general relativity}} differ significantly from those of classical physics, especially concerning the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light. Examples of such differences include <b>gravitational</b> time dilation, <b>gravitational</b> lensing, the <b>gravitational</b> redshift of light, and the <b>gravitational</b> time delay. The {{predictions of}} general relativity have been confirmed in all observations and experiments to date. Although general relativity {{is not the only}} relativistic theory of gravity, it is the simplest theory that is consistent with experimental data. However, unanswered questions remain, the most fundamental being how general relativity can be reconciled with the laws of quantum physics to produce a complete and self-consistent theory of quantum gravity.|$|E
5|$|The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) uses two 4-km Michelson-Fabry-Pérot interferometers for the {{detection}} of <b>gravitational</b> waves. In this application, the Fabry–Pérot cavity is used to store photons for almost a millisecond while they bounce up and down between the mirrors. This increases the time a <b>gravitational</b> wave can interact with the light, which results in a better sensitivity at low frequencies. Smaller cavities, usually called mode cleaners, are used for spatial filtering and frequency stabilization of the main laser. The first observation of <b>gravitational</b> waves occurred on September 14, 2015.|$|E
5|$|The first, indirect, {{detection}} of <b>gravitational</b> waves {{came in the}} 1970s through observation {{of a pair of}} closely orbiting neutron stars, PSR B1913+16. The explanation of the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting <b>gravitational</b> waves. Einstein's prediction was confirmed on 11 February 2016, when researchers at LIGO published the first observation of <b>gravitational</b> waves, on Earth, exactly one hundred years after the prediction.|$|E
5|$|The <b>gravitational</b> {{field of}} the Moon has been {{measured}} through tracking the Doppler shift of radio signals emitted by orbiting spacecraft. The main lunar gravity features are mascons, large positive <b>gravitational</b> anomalies associated {{with some of the}} giant impact basins, partly caused by the dense mare basaltic lava flows that fill those basins. The anomalies greatly influence the orbit of spacecraft about the Moon. There are some puzzles: lava flows by themselves cannot explain all of the <b>gravitational</b> signature, and some mascons exist that are not linked to mare volcanism.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape and}} {{energy of the}} land is {{significantly}} affected by <b>gravitational</b> forces. On a large scale, the distribution of <b>gravitational</b> forces on the earth is uneven and influences the shape and movement of tectonic plates as well as influencing geomorphic processes such as orogeny and erosion. These forces govern many of the geophysical properties and distributions of ecological biomes across the Earth. On the organismal scale, <b>gravitational</b> forces provide directional cues for plant and fungal growth (gravitropism), orientation cues for animal migrations, and influence the biomechanics and size of animals. Ecological traits, such as allocation of biomass in trees during growth are subject to mechanical failure as <b>gravitational</b> forces influence the position and structure of branches and leaves. The cardiovascular systems of animals are functionally adapted to overcome pressure and <b>gravitational</b> forces that change according to the features of organisms (e.g., height, size, shape), their behaviour (e.g., diving, running, flying), and the habitat occupied (e.g., water, hot deserts, cold tundra).|$|E
5|$|A 2012 study, {{analyzing}} <b>gravitational</b> microlensing data, estimates {{an average}} of at least 1.6 bound planets for every star in the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|A type of {{telescope}} is that detects <b>gravitational</b> waves; ripples in space-time generated by colliding neutron stars or black holes.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of the {{spectrum}} can also reveal the surface gravity of the star. This is usually expressed as log g, the base-10 logarithm of the <b>gravitational</b> acceleration given in CGS units, in this case, cm/s². Beta Pictoris has logg=4.15, implying a surface gravity of 140 m/s², which is {{about half of the}} <b>gravitational</b> acceleration at the surface of the Sun (274m/s²).|$|E
5|$|Assuming {{that the}} {{equivalence}} principle holds, gravity influences {{the passage of}} time. Light sent down into a gravity well is blueshifted, whereas light sent {{in the opposite direction}} (i.e., climbing out of the gravity well) is redshifted; collectively, these two effects are known as the <b>gravitational</b> frequency shift. More generally, processes close to a massive body run more slowly when compared with processes taking place farther away; this effect is known as <b>gravitational</b> time dilation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} its lifetime, a {{star with}} more than about 20 solar masses can undergo <b>gravitational</b> {{collapse}} to form a black hole. According to classical physics, these massive stellar objects exert a <b>gravitational</b> attraction that is strong enough to prevent anything, even electromagnetic radiation, from escaping past the Schwarzschild radius. However, quantum mechanical effects are believed to potentially allow the emission of Hawking radiation at this distance. Electrons (and positrons) are thought to be created at the event horizon of these stellar remnants.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{a number}} of {{land-based}} <b>gravitational</b> wave detectors are in operation, and a mission to launch a space-based detector, LISA, is currently under development, with a precursor mission (LISA Pathfinder) which was launched in 2015. <b>Gravitational</b> wave observations {{can be used to}} obtain information about compact objects such as neutron stars and black holes, and also to probe the state of the early universe fractions of a second after the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the members}} of a close binary system raises tides on the other through <b>gravitational</b> interaction. However the bulges can be {{slightly}} misaligned with respect to the direction of <b>gravitational</b> attraction. Thus the force of gravity produces a torque component on the bulge, resulting in the transfer of angular momentum (tidal acceleration). This causes the system to steadily evolve, although it can approach a stable equilibrium. The effect can be more complex in cases where the axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the orbital plane.|$|E
5|$|Einstein {{argued that}} {{this is true for}} {{fundamental}} reasons, because the <b>gravitational</b> field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a <b>gravitational</b> field. This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard.|$|E
5|$|Fine-scale {{variation}} (e.g. variation {{along the}} orbit of the Lunar Prospector orbiter) of the lunar <b>gravitational</b> field, {{which is consistent with}} geologic processes involving a crust, mantle, and core.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} (GR) is {{a theory}} of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed <b>gravitational</b> attraction between masses results from the warping {{of space and time}} by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where <b>gravitational</b> attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} is non-linear: the <b>gravitational</b> {{influence of}} two masses {{is not simply}} the sum of those masses' individual <b>gravitational</b> influences, as had {{been the case in}} Newtonian gravity. Ehlers participated in the discussion of how the back-reaction from <b>gravitational</b> radiation onto a radiating system could be systematically described in a non-linear theory such as general relativity, pointing out that the standard quadrupole formula for the energy flux for systems like the binary pulsar had not (yet) been rigorously derived: a priori, a derivation demanded the inclusion of higher-order terms than was commonly assumed, higher than were computed until then.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gravitational</b> metric systems use the {{kilogram-force}} (kilopond) as a {{base unit}} of force, with mass measured in a unit known as the hyl, Technische Mass Einheit (TME), mug or metric slug. Although the CGPM passed a resolution in 1901 defining the standard value of acceleration due to gravity to be 980.665cm/s2, <b>gravitational</b> units {{are not part of}} the International System of Units (SI).|$|E
5|$|<b>Gravitational</b> {{redshift}} {{was first}} measured {{in a laboratory}} setting in 1959 by Pound and Rebka. It is also seen in astrophysical measurements, notably for light escaping the white dwarf Sirius B. The related <b>gravitational</b> time dilation effect has been measured by transporting atomic clocks to altitudes of between tens {{and tens of thousands}} of kilometers (first by Hafele and Keating in 1971; most accurately to date by Gravity Probe A launched in 1976).|$|E
5|$|In February 2016, the Advanced LIGO team {{announced}} that they had directly observed <b>gravitational</b> waves from a black hole merger.|$|E
5|$|In Newton's {{description}} of gravity, the <b>gravitational</b> force {{is caused by}} matter. More precisely, it {{is caused by a}} specific property of material objects: their mass. In Einstein's theory and related theories of gravitation, curvature at every point in spacetime is also caused by whatever matter is present. Here, too, mass is a key property in determining the <b>gravitational</b> influence of matter. But in a relativistic theory of gravity, mass cannot be the only source of gravity. Relativity links mass with energy, and energy with momentum.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} work, Newton {{presented}} a calculus-like method of geometrical analysis using 'first and last ratios', gave the first analytical determination (based on Boyle's law) {{of the speed}} of sound in air, inferred the oblateness of Earth's spheroidal figure, accounted for the precession of the equinoxes {{as a result of the}} Moon's <b>gravitational</b> attraction on the Earth's oblateness, initiated the <b>gravitational</b> study of the irregularities in the motion of the moon, provided a theory for the determination of the orbits of comets, and much more.|$|E
5|$|MOA-2009-BLG-387 was a <b>gravitational</b> microlensing event {{detected}} by the Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics collaboration on July 24, 2009, which searches and documents chance and brief alignments of stars with other stars or objects; such alignments cause a <b>gravitational</b> lens effect, which bends light and causes distorted, but magnified, images {{that can be}} interpreted. The detection of two caustics were logged {{over the next few}} days by the South African Astronomical Observatory, the Perth Observatory, and the Canopus Hill Observatory in Tasmania, with a separation of about seven days between caustic events.|$|E
5|$|Observations of binary pulsars provide strong {{indirect}} {{evidence for the}} existence of <b>gravitational</b> waves (see Orbital decay, above). Detection of these waves is a major goal of current relativity-related research. Several land-based <b>gravitational</b> wave detectors are currently in operation, most notably the interferometric detectors GEO 600, LIGO (two detectors), TAMA 300 and VIRGO. Various pulsar timing arrays are using millisecond pulsars to detect <b>gravitational</b> waves in the 10−9 to 10−6 Hertz frequency range, which originate from binary supermassive blackholes. A European space-based detector, eLISA / NGO, is currently under development, with a precursor mission (LISA Pathfinder) having launched in December 2015.|$|E
5|$|Observations of <b>gravitational</b> waves {{promise to}} {{complement}} observations in the electromagnetic spectrum. They {{are expected to}} yield information about black holes and other dense objects such as neutron stars and white dwarfs, about certain kinds of supernova implosions, and about processes {{in the very early}} universe, including the signature of certain types of hypothetical cosmic string. In February 2016, the Advanced LIGO team announced that they had detected <b>gravitational</b> waves from a black hole merger.|$|E
5|$|One {{hypothesis}} is formation by the <b>gravitational</b> instability. Particles several centimeters in size or larger slowly settle {{near the middle}} plane of the disk, forming a very thin—less than 100km—and dense layer. This layer is gravitationally unstable and may fragment into numerous clumps, which in turn collapse into planetesimals. However, the differing velocities of the gas disk and the solids near the mid-plane can generate turbulence which prevents the layer from becoming thin enough to fragment due to <b>gravitational</b> instability. This may limit the formation of planetesimals via <b>gravitational</b> instabilities to specific locations in the disk where the concentration of solids is enhanced.|$|E
5|$|See also {{physical}} cosmology textbooks {{for applications}} of the cosmological and <b>gravitational</b> redshifts.|$|E
5|$|Some redshifts are {{an example}} of the Doppler effect, {{familiar}} in the change of apparent pitches of sirens and frequency of the sound waves emitted by speeding vehicles. A redshift occurs whenever a light source moves away from an observer. A special instance of this is the cosmological redshift, which is due to the expansion of the universe, and sufficiently distant light sources (generally more than a few million light years away) show redshift corresponding to the rate of increase in their distance from Earth. Finally, <b>gravitational</b> redshift is a relativistic effect observed in electromagnetic radiation moving out of <b>gravitational</b> fields. Conversely, a decrease in wavelength is called blueshift and is generally seen when a light-emitting object moves toward an observer or when electromagnetic radiation moves into a <b>gravitational</b> field. However, redshift is a more common term and sometimes blueshift is referred to as negative redshift.|$|E
