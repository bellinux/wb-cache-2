Isoprene significantly slowed down the auto-oxidation in acidic and basic solutions, and accelerated it slightly in neutral solutions.

The experimental results were explained by changes in a subtle quantitative balance of three superimposed processes whose rates depended in different manner on the acidity of reacting solutions – the scavenging of sulphoxy radical-anions by isoprene, the formation of sulphoxy radical-anions during further reactions of isoprene radicals, and the auto-oxidation of S IV itself. A chemical mechanism based on this idea was explored numerically to show good agreement with experimental data. In basic and neutral solutions, the model overestimated the consumption of isoprene, probably because reactions of primary sulphite and sulphate derivatives of isoprene with sulphoxy radical-anions were not included.

40|$|Oxy-fuel {{combustion}} enables {{fossil fuel}} combustion without greenhouse gas emissions, by the including capture and subsequent storage of the CO 2 formed. In {{order to make}} this possible the CO 2 must be compressed and liquefied. In the compression section of the oxy-fuel process, a variety of compounds are present, such as water vapour, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphuric oxides (SOx). The chemistry of NOx and SOx under pressurised conditions in gas-liquid systems is still under discussion {{and there is no}} consensus about which mechanisms that are of importance. This is important to find out in order to design an appropriate technical solution for the control of NOx and SOx in the outlet streams. The aim of this thesis work is to evaluate the NOx and SOx chemistry under pressurized gas-liquid conditions by comparing the major previous works in the area. Experimental work at Imperial College [1 - 4] and at Henri Poincaré University [5] are compared to a recently developed model by Pettersson [6, 7]. The comparison is made by developing a new model using the reaction mechanism in Pettersson’s model for simulation of the reactors in the experiments. The results show that the rate-determining step for acid formation from NOx is the oxidation of NO to NO 2, which has been shown in earlier studies [6, 7]. In the liquid phase (in absence of SOx) NO 2 forms nitrous and nitric acid. Nitrous acid slowly dissociates to nitric acid and NO. SO 2 forms mainly <b>sulphurous</b> <b>acid</b> when absorbed into the liquid phase. In presence of both NOx and SOx at low pH, the nitrous and <b>sulphurous</b> <b>acid</b> react and form N 2 O, which diffuses into the gas phase where it is stable. At pH-values above 4, the N 2 O formation is unimportant and instead hydroxylamine disulfonic acid (HADS) is formed. There are indications in the experiments at Imperial College [3], but not in the model, showing that NOx might be able to catalyze formation of sulphuric acid from SO 2. However, the experimental results points in different directions and {{it is not possible to}} confirm that this is an important mechanism; additional experimental work is thus required to confirm this mechanism...|$|R

This is the case with dried sugar beet pulp as a byproduct of sugar refining process. One of the possibilities to reduce energy consumption is savings in the process of thermal dehydration in the process of the conventional drying of pulp. Pulp drying is one third of total energy consumption in the sugar factory. Acidification of water extraction result in pulp that could be pressed better and in other hand in the juice with less non-sucrose compounds. Keeping the extraction process under certain conditions, directly affects {{on the quality of the}} extracted pulp and on effects of their further processing. This paper examines the impact of the extraction parameters of sugar from sugar beet and agents of acidification for water extraction (<b>sulphurous</b> <b>acid,</b> hydrogen peroxide) on the quality of dried sugar beet pulp. Extraction of sugar from sugar beet cossettes by hydrogen peroxide at pH 5. 5 to 8. 5 does not cause changes in mechanical properties of sugar beet cossettes and in water retention coefficient, but increases the brightness of dried sugar beet pulp for about 5 - 7 units, which solubility in water does not depend on the applied concentration of extracting agents, but increases in dependence on the duration of the extraction. Sugar beet pulp extracted at pH 11. 0 has reduced strength, they are highly hydrated, and under the force they lose their shape, binding a larger amount of water thus reducing the effect of their pressing. The changes in microstructure were probably accompanied by segmenting the linear parts of macromolecules and are reflected in the increase of water retention capacity and increase the solubility of dried sugar beet pulp for two to three times. Under the same conditions of extraction, <b>sulphurous</b> <b>acid</b> produces similar but relatively mild changes in the characteristics of extracted and dried sugar beet pulp compared to conditions when hydrogen peroxide is used. From the point of the quality of the product of extraction, the most favorable results are obtained when the extraction is carried on at pH 5. 5 for a period of 1 h at 70 °C, using water for extraction with sulphourus acid with the addition of 5 % hydrogen peroxide. Under these conditions no significant degradation of sugar beet tissue is detected, do not change the physical, chemical and mechanical properties of the extracted pulp. But there is an average increase of lightness of dried noodles for about 7 units, which represents a significant improvement of their quality, since there is difficult to sell on the market the dried sugar beet pulp with increased colour...|$|R

The iodometric method, which is used in practice for determination of sulphur dioxide in foods are characterized. Differences molasses and sugar as objects of iodometric determination of sulfur dioxide, which leads to the inability to ascertain the equivalence point. The variants eliminate interfering background of dark-colored foods common in analytical chemistry. Advantages and disadvantages of the background masking and stripping the determination of sulfur dioxide in the darkcolored products. It was characterized by clarifying sugar solutions in optical control methods. The hypothesis about preferability of its use in sample molasses preparation for equivalence point fixation in iodometric titration is suggested. The tasks of experimental research for the development of sample preparation algorithm molasses in determining the content of <b>sulphurous</b> <b>acid...</b>|$|R
40|$|A mineralogical {{study was}} {{undertaken}} of air heater deposits in a 300 MWe pf boiler located in Western Australia {{to understand the}} deposit formation in air heater sections of boiler {{as an aid to}} implement possible remediation actions. Several air heater deposit samples were collected in the selected regions of the air heater along with samples of the feed coal, bottom ash and fly ash for comparison of ash chemistry and mineralogy. The deposit samples were examined using a combination of ash chemistry and quantitative X-ray diffraction analysis; the ash samples by bulk chemical analysis to determine the major element chemistry and mineralogy by quantitative X-ray diffraction. Samples of the deposits were also analysed using optical microscopy and QEMSCAN, an automated electron beam image analysis system. Chemical and mineralogical analysis showed that the deposits are unusual in containing high amounts of sulphate, particularly of aluminium and, to a lesser extent, iron. From the analyses it appears that the formation of the deposits is due to the high sulphate content which is acting as a cementing agent. There is an indication that temperature could be another factor in formation of the deposits, with a decrease in temperature leading to the formation of <b>sulphurous</b> <b>acid</b> which then reacts with the reactive glassy amorphous fly ash phase to form the aluminium and iron sulphates. Dew point calculations indicated that this is a possible deposit formation mechanism based upon air heater temperature data obtained from the utility. There was no evidence that unburnt carbon has {{played a significant role in}} deposit formation. Large temperature fluctuations resulting from the inherent nature of the operation of the air heater are a significant factor in deposit formation and a practical solution to consider would be the use of an SO 2 absorbent placed prior to the air heater...|$|R
40|$|The {{fractions}} of volatile compounds in plants are essential {{in defining the}} sensory impact of an aromatic smell, {{as well as being}} of some medicinal importance. Epicuticular wax in plants also determine its susceptibility to disease, and herbivore, desiccation and ultraviolet radiation damage. The epicuticular wax consisting of hydrocarbons and some volatile compounds of the leaves of Kigelia pinnata (Kigelia africana; family Bignoniaceae), a multimedicinal plant, was extracted, isolated and analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively for the various chemical compositions using GC (equipped with a flame thermionic detector -GC/FTD) and GCMS (“GCMS-QP 2010 Plus, which employs a dual inlet Turbo Molecular Pump (TMP) that provides increased sensitivity and column flow capacity for improved performance and confident results. The evaluation is useful for the future comprehensive analysis of the constituents responsible for the various documented medicinal uses of the leaf. The extracted constituent revealed twelve compounds with the major ones identified as n-hentriacontane (55. 40 %) : a probable anti-tumour compound; 1 -tricosene, (18. 45 %); 11 - (2, 2 - dimethylpropyl) heneicosane, (9. 66 %); 2, 6, 10 -trimethyldodecane, (4. 43 %); pentafluoroheptadecyl ester, (4. 40 %); 2 -ethylhexyloctadecyl sulfurous acid ester, (3. 05 %); heneicosane, (1. 61 %); and hexyloctyl <b>sulphurous</b> <b>acid</b> ester, (1. 42 %). Other compounds are recorded in minute quantities. The major component, identified as hentriacontane, a C- 31 saturated hydrocarbon apparently is responsible for the plant susceptibility to diseases, protection against UV radiation and for the antitumour and antioxidative potential of the plant. This will give credence to the traditional use of the plant as an anti-inflammatory and anticancer. The ability of the plant to act as anti-sun burn {{may be due to the}} presence of the wax...|$|R
60|$|Scientific {{definitions}}, {{whether they}} are definitions of scientific terms, or of common terms used in a scientific sense, are almost always of the kind last spoken of: their main purpose is {{to serve as the}} landmarks of scientific classification. And since the classifications in any science are continually modified as scientific knowledge advances, the definitions in the sciences are also constantly varying. A striking instance is afforded by the words Acid and Alkali, especially the former. As experimental discovery advanced, the substances classed with acids have been constantly multiplying, and by a natural consequence the attributes connoted by the word have receded and become fewer. At first it connoted the attributes, of combining with an alkali to form a neutral substance (called a salt); being compounded of a base and oxygen; causticity to the taste and touch; fluidity, etc. The true analysis of muriatic acid, into chlorine and hydrogen, caused the second property, composition from a base and oxygen, to be excluded from the connotation. The same discovery fixed the attention of chemists upon hydrogen as an important element in acids; and more recent discoveries having led to the recognition of its presence in sulphuric, nitric, and many other acids, where its existence was not previously suspected, there is now a tendency to include the presence of this element in the connotation of the word. But carbonic <b>acid,</b> silica, <b>sulphurous</b> <b>acid,</b> have no hydrogen in their composition; that property can not, therefore, be connoted by the term, unless those substances are no longer to be considered acids. Causticity and fluidity have long since been excluded from the characteristics of the class, by the inclusion of silica and many other substances in it; and the formation of neutral bodies by combination with alkalis, together with such electro-chemical peculiarities as this is supposed to imply, are now the only differentiæ which form the fixed connotation of the word Acid, as a term of chemical science.|$|R
