5|$|On September 2, 1901, the farm's <b>dairy</b> {{buildings}} {{were destroyed by}} fire. The cause of the fire (which was discovered in the <b>dairy</b> building's tower) was unknown, and the damage was covered by insurance. Law quickly arranged for a temporary <b>dairy</b> in a room of the electric plant which had a boiler for sterilization; by the afternoon, milk was processed as usual. A larger <b>dairy</b> building was planned closer to the railroad station for faster shipping.|$|E
5|$|The {{content of}} MFGM in <b>dairy</b> {{products}} {{varies depending on}} the processing involved. During <b>dairy</b> processing such as churning or decreaming, the MFGM is disrupted and preferentially distributed into aqueous phases such as buttermilk, butter serum, or certain type of whey. Thus {{they can be a}} good source of MFGM for addition into food products.|$|E

5|$|Wool was New Zealand's major {{agricultural}} export {{during the}} late 19th century. Even {{as late as the}} 1960s it made up over a third of all export revenues, but since then its price has steadily dropped relative to other commodities and wool is no longer profitable for many farmers. In contrast <b>dairy</b> farming increased, with the number of <b>dairy</b> cows doubling between 1990 and 2007, to become New Zealand's largest export earner. In the year to June 2009, <b>dairy</b> products accounted for 21% ($9.1 billion) of total merchandise exports, and the country's largest company, Fonterra, controls almost one-third of the international <b>dairy</b> trade. Other agricultural exports in 2009 were meat 13.2%, wool 6.3%, fruit 3.5% and fishing 3.3%. New Zealand's wine industry has followed a similar trend to <b>dairy,</b> the number of vineyards doubling over the same period, overtaking wool exports {{for the first time in}} 2007.|$|E
5|$|A minor {{class of}} sheep are the <b>dairy</b> breeds. Dual-purpose breeds that may {{primarily}} be meat or wool sheep {{are often used}} secondarily as milking animals, {{but there are a}} few breeds that are predominantly used for milking. These sheep produce a higher quantity of milk and have slightly longer lactation curves. In the quality of their milk, the fat and protein content percentages of <b>dairy</b> sheep vary from non-dairy breeds, but lactose content does not.|$|E

5|$|Controlled {{fermentation}} with microbes in brewing, wine making, baking, pickling and cultured <b>dairy</b> {{products such}} as yogurt and cheese, is used to modify ingredients to make foods with desirable properties. The principal microbes involved are yeasts, {{in the case of}} beer, wine, and ordinary bread; and bacteria, in the case of anaerobically fermented vegetables, <b>dairy</b> products, and sourdough bread. The cultures variously provide flavour and aroma, inhibit pathogens, increase digestibility and palatability, make bread rise, reduce cooking time, and create useful products including alcohol, organic acids, vitamins, amino acids, and carbon dioxide.|$|E
