25|$|Bravo and Charlie {{companies}} of 1st Battalion 5th SFG crossed the Kuwait border at H-Hour with ODA 531 using breaching demolition charges {{to clear a}} path through the sand berms. Charlie company's seven ODAs in 35 vehicles took the southeastern operation box of the western desert heading towards the towns of Nukyab, Habbariya and Mudyasis, ODA 534 split off to head for the area surrounding Nukyab serching for mobile SCUB-B TEL launch sites. Bravo company set out for the central town of Ar Rutba and H-3 Air Base with six ODAs and a support ODB (Operational Detachment Bravo). ODAs 523 and 524 searched a suspected Scud-B storage facility while ODAs 521 and 525 were tasked with clearing several abandoned airfields, with no sign of Scud launchers, ODA 525 deployed a Special Reconnaissance team to conduct pattern of life surveillance on the town of Ar Rutba. A two-man team called in a pair of nearby F-16C Fighting Falcons to destroy an Iraqi Army radio direction-finding facility they had identified. A second reconnaissance team from ODA 525 deployed to cover the two highways leading to Ar Rutbah, however as the team was compromised by roving Bedouins who informed the Iraqi Army garrison at Ar Rutbah of the teams presence and location, armed Iraqi technicals crewed by the Fedayeen drove out to search for them, so the Green Berets mounted their GMVs, left their hide and found a position to ambush the Fedayeen, under the weight of fire the Fedayeen retreated. ODA 525 attempted to link up with the two-man reconnaissance team and extract it to safety but large numbers of Iraqi vehicles began driving out of the town to them, the ODAs called in <b>immediate</b> <b>air</b> <b>support.</b> whilst waiting, the reconnaissance team fired on the Fedayeen leaders with their suppressed MK12 sniper rifle and contacted ODA 521 (whom were clearing suspected east of the town) and they reinforced ODA 525. Within minutes, F-16Cs arrived and engaged the Fedayeen vehicles, another Fedayeen convoy attempted to outflank ODA 525 but ran into the guns of ODA 524, after 4 hours of constant and punishing airstrikes on the encircling Fedayeen, eight GMVs of ODA 521 and 525 managed to extract the exposed reconnaissance team under the cover of a B-1B strategic bomber, the vehicles withdrew to ODB 520s staging area south of Ar Rutbah. Over 100 Fedayeen fighters were killed and four armed technicals were destroyed. To the west ODA 523 reinforced ODA 524, but ran into a pair of armed technicals on the highway, both were destroyed by the GMVs, the Green Berets ceased fire when a civilian station wagon full of Iraqi children drove {{into the middle of the}} firefight. ODA 522 also identified two Fedayeen armed technicals proceeding down the highway toward ODA 523, they set an ambush for them, destroying the vehicles and killing 15 Fedayeen.|$|E
50|$|Marine Air Control Group 28 (MACG-28) is a United States Marine Corps {{aviation}} {{command and}} control unit based at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point that is currently composed of 4 squadrons and a battalion that provide the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing with airspace coordination, air control, <b>immediate</b> <b>air</b> <b>support,</b> fires integration, air traffic control (ATC), radar surveillance, aviation combat element (ACE) communications support, and an integrated ACE command post {{in support of the}} II Marine Expeditionary Force.|$|E
50|$|DOD Defined The {{principal}} {{air control}} {{agency of the}} theater air control system responsible for the direction and control of air operations directly supporting the ground combat element. It processes and coordinates requests for <b>immediate</b> <b>air</b> <b>support</b> and coordinates air missions requiring integration with other supporting arms and ground forces. It normally collocates with the Army tactical headquarters senior fire support coordination center within the ground combat element. Also called ASOC. See also air support; close air support; operation; tactical air control center.|$|E

5000|$|Efforts {{were made}} to improve the {{integration}} of <b>immediate</b> artillery and <b>air</b> <b>support,</b> which had been poorly coordinated. While U.S. artillery response times improved dramatically, coordinating close <b>air</b> <b>support</b> was not achieved until Operation Overlord over a year later. American anti-aircraft artillery began reforms, having learned that, while Stuka dive bombers were vulnerable to [...]50 BMG rounds fired from vehicles, field units needed dedicated autocannon {{to protect them from}} aerial attack: in one division, 95 percent of air attacks were concentrated on its artillery.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Air</b> <b>Support</b> Operations Center (ASOC) is {{an element}} of the Theater Air Control System (TACS) aligned with the senior Army {{maneuver}} unit (Division or Corps/Corps Equiv) in theater and directly subordinate to the Air Operations Center, which is the senior TACS agency in a theater. Organizationally, ASOCs are also <b>Air</b> <b>Support</b> Operations Squadrons and named as such, but organized and equipped as an ASOC. ASOCs are commanded by an Air Force LtCol. The ASOC manages allotted air resources and executes missions supporting its aligned Army units. 1C4X1s assigned to an ASOC fill a vital role by receiving <b>air</b> <b>support</b> requests from forward deployed JTACs. Once an <b>air</b> <b>support</b> request is received, the <b>air</b> <b>support</b> request is either approved or disapproved by the ground commander's land component chain of command. If approved, immediate requests to support urgent, troops-in-contact situations may result in strike aircraft being sent by the ASOC to the JTACs location for terminal control of <b>immediate</b> close <b>air</b> <b>support.</b> Approved, but non-urgent, <b>air</b> <b>support</b> requests submitted after the cut-off time for inclusion on the next Air Tasking Order will become scheduled missions on the subsequent Air Tasking Order. If an <b>air</b> <b>support</b> request is disapproved, the disapproved request should be sent back to the requesting unit with reasons for disapproval. It is important to understand that approval and disapproval authority of <b>air</b> <b>support</b> requests {{is the responsibility of the}} Army / Land Component being supported.|$|R
50|$|The {{squadron}} {{also provided}} Direct Air Support Center and Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) personnel {{and equipment to}} support US Army units in Hawaii. During 1982, the 22d participated {{in a number of}} exercises and prepared plans for conversion to the OV-10. Converted to the OV-10 aircraft, August-October 1983. Supported U.S. Army on the ground with TACPs creating a network which provided the Army with <b>immediate</b> <b>air</b> <b>support</b> and, in the air, with OV-10 forward air control support. Participated in numerous exercises with US and allied army ground units throughout the Far East.|$|E
50|$|The DASC {{processes}} <b>immediate</b> <b>air</b> <b>support</b> requests; coordinates aircraft employment {{with other}} supporting arms; manages terminal control assets supporting GCE and {{combat service support}} element forces; and controls assigned aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and itinerant aircraft transiting through DASC controlled airspace. The DASC controls and directs air support activities that effect the GCE commander's focus on close operations and those air missions requiring integration with the ground combat forces (close air support CAS, assault support and designated air reconnaissance). The DASC does not normally control aircraft conducting deep air support (DAS) missions as detailed coordination of DAS missions is not required with ground forces. However, the DASC will provide battle damage assessments (BDAs) and mission reports (MISREPs) from DAS missions to the GCE's senior fire support coordination center (FSCC) and TACC when required.|$|E
5000|$|Richard Phillips takes {{command of}} MV Maersk Alabama, an unarmed {{container}} ship from the Port of Salalah in Oman, with orders to sail through the Gulf of Aden to Mombasa, Kenya. Wary of pirate activity {{off the coast}} of the Horn of Africa, he and First Officer Shane Murphy order strict security precautions on the vessel and carry out practice drills. During a drill, the vessel is chased by Somali pirates in two skiffs, and Phillips calls for help.

5|$|Even {{though in}} his 1955 book Egypt's Destiny, Naguib wrote that his brigade's {{successful}} stand was a glorious victory with few consequences, estimating 450 Israeli dead (out of a perceived 4,000 attackers), a logbook captured by Israel {{during the war}} revealed that he was extremely worried about the future fate of his forces. He requested <b>immediate</b> assistance, including <b>air</b> <b>support</b> to determine {{the location of the}} Israeli cannons, a medevac unit, reinforcements, munitions and communication wires. It is also likely that he believed that the 53rd Battalion's force blocking the road from Majdal was still in place, and therefore thought that he was surrounded.|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews work {{completed}} oil a value-judgment-based tactical air command system intended to dispatch missions from a limited supply {{in response to}} requests for <b>immediate</b> close <b>air</b> <b>support.</b> A Judged Utility Decision Generator (JUDGE) assumes tliat value judg-ments can be made explicitly and in real time by appropriately trained per-sonnel, and that decision systems hould maximize xpected utility. Its inputs include demand forecasts, numbers of aircraft available, and turnaround time distributions. As each request is received, JUDGE makes a dispatching decision based on the judged utility of destroying the target named in the request, kill probability data, number of sorties remaining before resupply of aircraft, and the time. In a war-game situation using experienced military subjects, JUDGE was considerably superior to a simulated current system in amount of expected utility gained. Concluding sections of the paper identify characteristics of judgment-based command systems, and discuss logical im-plications of such characteristics for system evaluation. Algorithms for making decisions in real situations are usually extremely complicated. The search for such algorithms defines {{much of the work}} of operations researchers, ystems analysts, and similar experts. But that search is often unsuccessful; many real decision tasks are intractable to full formal analysis. The designers of decision-making systems intended to cope with such tasks usually allocate the functions of information processing and decision making in such systems to men, presumably hoping that human intuition can deal effectively with problems too com...|$|R
