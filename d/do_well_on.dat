While {{a small percentage of}} owners choose such a diet based on its perceived health benefits, the majority do so due to ethical concerns. Despite this, most vegans who feed their cats a vegan diet believe that a vegetarian diet is healthier than a conventional diet. There is much controversy over feeding cats a vegetarian diet. While there is anecdotal evidence that cats <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>on</b> vegetarian food, studies on commercial and homemade vegetarian cat foods have found nutritional inadequacies.|$|E

25|$|A {{right arm}} bowler of slow to medium pace, Walter Mead always {{maintained}} an excellent length and could spin back to deadly effect whenever wickets {{were affected by}} rain. He could vary his stock off break with a ball that turned the other way, but he lacked the deceptive flight that enabled such bowlers as Blythe, Dennett or J.C.

By the 1935 season he was rarely given substantial spells of bowling but still could <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>on</b> a sticky pitch, as at Edgbaston in the 1936 season when he took twelve Warwickshire wickets. Along with Dennis Smith he was the indispensable backbone of the batting, which was that year still very weak for a champion county. His best score that year was 182 not out against Sussex at Chesterfield. Townsend played a season with Auckland in 1934/1935, and after his batting declined so badly in 1939 that he scored fewer than 700 runs {{for an average of}} only 19, Townsend settled in New Zealand permanently.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} supporting some {{deviations from the}} standard regimen when treating pulmonary TB. Sputum culture positive patients who are smear negative {{at the start of}} treatment do well with only 4 months of treatment (this has not been validated for HIV-positive patients); and sputum culture negative patients <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>on</b> only 3 months of treatment (possibly because some of these patients never had TB at all). It is unwise to treat patients for only three or four months, but all TB physicians will have patients who stop their treatment early (for whatever reason), and it can be re-assuring to know that sometimes retreatment is unnecessary. Elderly patients who are already taking a large number of tablets may be offered 9HR, omitting PZA which is the bulkiest part of the regimen.|$|E

On the contrary, Chia-yi finds it childish for Ching-teng to injure himself for no reason. This upsets Ching-teng, sparking a quarrel that causes the two to break up.|$|E

2500|$|Loveless' second single, [...] "I Did", was {{released}} in April 1986. The song had gone out with releases from four other MCA singers, {{all of whom had}} album contracts. Shortly after its release, Roger Bowen asked Loveless to come into his office where he explained to her that he wanted to pull the song from radio because it was succeeding too well. [...] "I have to be fair to the other artists". In return, he would give Loveless an album deal and she could release [...] "I Did" [...] as a single from her first album. This produced the self-titled Patty Loveless album, being initially released on October 1, 1986 in a promotional form, with a full release on February 21, 1987. The singles, [...] "Wicked Ways" [...] and [...] "After All", were released from that album, which again, did not <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>on</b> the charts but garnered sufficient airplay that Tony Brown decided to sign Loveless to a long-term recording contract.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the most}} part, the {{curriculum}} offered {{in secondary schools}} {{is that of the}} CXC geared towards preparing students to leave secondary school with subject passes at the Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate (CSEC) or the Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination (CAPE). CSEC is equivalent to the UK's General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) and CAPE to A-levels.

The eleventh track [...] "Treat Me Right" [...] was deemed as [...] "the standout track" [...] on the album, which is generated via a co-writing/production credit from one-time rival JC Chasez, ex-member of NSYNC. It is an electropop song, and utilises the group's vocal interplay to admirable effect. [...] "Love Will Keep You Up All Night" [...] was classified as a [...] "montage of almost every love-song ever written and with a chorus reminiscent of Aerosmith's 'I Don't Want to Miss a Thing'." [...] "Unmistakable" [...] was considered [...] "one of the stronger tracks on the album." [...] The song features very strong vocal arrangements and instrumentation. The second part of [...] "Unsuspecting Sunday Afternoon" [...] closes out the album, and is about three and half minutes in length. Commencing with only a piano, the song then adds a live drum beat and orchestral instruments, followed by an electric guitar solo and atmospheric harmonies. All four members co-wrote the song and hailed it as the best song in the album.|$|E

I believe the quiet {{admission}} which we are all of us so ready to make, that, because things have long been wrong, it is impossible they should ever be right, {{is one of the}} most fatal sources of misery and crime from which this world suffers.

It is very Utopian to hope for the entire doing away with drunkenness and misery out of the Canongate; but the Utopianism is not our business--the work is.

The grain is of excellent quality, the bread made from it being equal to any I have ever tasted, and it is universally acknowledged to be unsurpassed by any made from imported European or American flour. The fact that the natives have (quite of their own accord) taken to cultivating such foreign articles as wheat and potatoes, which they bring in small quantities {{on the backs of}} ponies by the most horrible mountain tracks, and sell very cheaply at the seaside, sufficiently indicates what might be done if good roads were made, and if the people were taught, encouraged, and protected.

However, whenever I have met him he has never failed to thrust himself upon me, and to show that his animosity is as bitter as it was on the day that I refused to appoint him steward. He left my neighbourhood at once, turned the stock into money, and as I know that he came into three or four thousand pounds at his father's death he had every chance of doing well. I believe that he did <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>on</b> the turf for a time, but the usual end came to that. When I met him last, some seven or eight years ago, I happened to be with a member of the Jockey Club who knew something of the fellow.

From his appearance to-day it is evident that he is still a hanger-on of racecourses. I saw he had the name of Marvel on his hat. I should say that probably he appears with a fresh name each time. I think the chance of meeting him has had something to do with my giving up going to races altogether.
