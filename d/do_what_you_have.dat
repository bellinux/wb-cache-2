2500|$|In one {{particular}} experiment, Shaw {{tried to get}} them to say on film that he was not allowed to touch the object he was supposed to bend in the experiment (he had already secretly done that, and with them affirming that he could not and had not touched it, the [...] "miracle" [...] would look even greater). When Shaw asked: [...] "Can I touch it?", the reply was, to his surprise: [...] "You <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to do." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Nothing, friend, nothing! I was but {{thinking}} how I bit into his hand. Sooner would I bite living toad or poisoned snake. Oh, I shall loathe my lips forever!

Have you come here to sneer and jibe and scorn and mock, and gloat over the misfortunes of the women whose home you have broken up, ruined, and devastated?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'They told me,' he continued, after a pause, 'a lot {{of silly}} gossip which I was cad enough to believe. I know now it wasn't true, because--well, if it <b>had</b> been, <b>you</b> would not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "What {{you said}} of the longing, the yearning which exists to-day amongst the inarticulate {{millions}} moved me most--and of the place of art in religion, to express that yearning.

You have made it, at least, all-comprehensive, have given me a new point of view for which I can never be sufficiently grateful--and {{at a time when}} I needed it desperately. That you have dared to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done has been and will be an inspiration, not only to myself, but to many others.

It 's horrible, most horrible, that such a {{difference}} as this should come between two men who believed themselves--or whom I believed, at least--the best friends in the world. For it is a difference--it 's a great gulf, and nothing will ever fill it up. I must say so; I can't help it. You know I don't express myself easily; so, if I break out this way, you may know what I feel. I know it is a pain to Miss Vivian, and I beg her to forgive me. She has so much to forgive that she can forgive that, too. I can't pretend to accept it; I can't sit down and let it pass. And then, it is n't only my feelings; it 's the right; it 's the justice. I must say to her {{that you have no}} right to marry her; and beg of her to listen to me and let you go." ...|$|E
