40|$|Bandwidth caps, a {{limit on}} the amount of data users can upload and {{download}} in a month, are common globally for both home and mobile Internet access. With caps, each bit of data consumed comes at a cost against a monthly quota or a running tab. Yet, relatively little work has considered the implications of this usage-based pricing model on the user experience. In this paper, we present results from a qualitative study of households living with bandwidth caps. Our findings suggest home users grapple with three uncertainties regarding their bandwidth usage: <b>invisible</b> <b>balances,</b> mysterious processes, and multiple users. We discuss how these uncertainties impact their usage and describe the potential for better tools to help monitor and manage data caps. We conclude that as a community we need to cater for users under Internet cost constraints. Author Keywords Bandwidth, metered use, data cap, Internet, pricing, usage...|$|R
40|$|Rudd Government ministers {{have talked}} tough towards the more militant Australian trade unions {{since coming to}} office in November 2007. However, despite this, it is still {{fair to say that}} the removal of the Howard-Costello Government reduced neo-liberal hegemony by {{altering}} the <b>invisible</b> <b>balance</b> of power between capital and labour in the construction industry. Using a set of case studies, based on data obtained from fieldwork at the New South Wales, Australia branch of the Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU), we document key elements of union strategy at the branch level in the year immediately after the removal of the Howard-Costello Government. A key aspect of branch level strategy was building site visits by a team of organisers, led by the divisional state secretary, designed to rebuild influence on site and reconnect with workers. Furthermore, the CFMEU’s hiring of foreign language speaking organisers and production of foreign language publications is a praiseworthy attempt to reach out to ethnic minority workers and bring them under the ‘mainstream’ union umbrella. We use a theory framework of Roman Catholic social teaching to frame our discussions. ...|$|R

25|$|The nation's {{need for}} U.S. made capital goods increased, though ongoing {{limits on the}} Central Bank's {{availability}} of hard currency hampered access to them. Argentina's pound Sterling surpluses earned after 1946 (worth over US$200million) were made convertible to dollars by a treaty negotiated by Central Bank President Miguel Miranda; but after a year, British Prime Minister Clement Attlee suspended the provision. Perón accepted the transfer of over 24,000km (15,000mi) of British-owned railways (over half the total in Argentina) {{in exchange for the}} debt in March 1948. Due to political disputes between Perón and the U.S. government (as well as to pressure by the U.S. agricultural lobby through the Agricultural Act of 1949), Argentine foreign exchange earnings via its exports to the United States fell, turning a US$100million surplus with the United States into a US$300million deficit. The combined pressure practically devoured Argentina's liquid reserves and Miranda issued a temporary restriction on the outflow of dollars to U.S. banks. The nationalization of the Port of Buenos Aires and domestic and foreign-owned private cargo ships, as well as the purchase of others, nearly tripled the national merchant marine to 1.2million tons' displacement, reducing the need for over US$100million in shipping fees (then the largest source of Argentina's <b>invisible</b> <b>balance</b> deficit) and leading to the inauguration of the Río Santiago Shipyards at Ensenada (on line to the present day).|$|R

6000|$|And so {{the yellow}} lamplight dies {{out in the}} gray of morning, in the King's Palace, over such a scene. Scene of jostling, elbowing, of confusion, and indeed conclusion, for the thing is about to end. Roederer and {{spectral}} Ministers jostle in the press; consult, in side cabinets, with one or with both Majesties. Sister Elizabeth takes the Queen to the window: [...] "Sister, see what a beautiful sunrise," [...] right over the Jacobins church and that quarter! How happy if the tocsin did not yield! But Mandat returns not; Petion is gone: much hangs wavering in the <b>invisible</b> <b>Balance.</b> About five o'clock, there rises from the Garden a kind of sound; as of a shout to which had become a howl, and instead of Vive le Roi were ending in Vive la Nation. [...] "Mon Dieu!" [...] ejaculates a spectral Minister, [...] "what is he doing down there?" [...] For it is his Majesty, gone down with old Marshal Maille to review the troops; and the nearest companies of them answer so. Her Majesty bursts into a stream of tears. Yet on stepping from the cabinet her eyes are dry and calm, her look is even cheerful. 'The Austrian lip, and the aquiline nose, fuller than usual, gave to her countenance,' says Peltier, (in Toulongeon, ii. 241.)

This is in marked contrast to another, slightly earlier method of powering known as [...] "parallel powering" [...] or [...] "T-powering" [...] (from the German term Tonaderspeisung), in which DC was overlaid directly onto the signal in differential mode. Connecting a conventional microphone to an input that had parallel powering enabled could very well damage the microphone.|$|R

40|$|By {{our past}} review, {{this paper will}} verify the {{hypothesis}} that the autonomous (<b>invisible)</b> body <b>balancing</b> would be better under changeable demand speed and a leading principle in the collaborative networks. This hypothesis was first utilized in the Conveyor-Serviced Production System (CSP System) with cycle time by a Station-Centered Approach to the physical networks. Recently, we are ascertaining this hypothesis in cost/profit balancing under demand speed (invisible hand) at the economic body chain networks. Generally, it becomes simpler at series (cyclic) type, but would not be so at parallel (semi-cyclic) type. Throughout this paper, we will point out the principle of autonomous (invisible) body ba-lancing by demand speed (cycle time), and would extend to a parallel (semi-cyclic) supply chain by the Station-Centered Approach. This thing would bring the invisible merit that the profit maximization occurs at the relative cost balancing of each enterprise in a series-parallel body network...|$|R
40|$|Cities in Europe control {{municipal}} services, varying from education, public health, {{waste management}} and housing policies, {{that at times}} clash with European Union rules regulating {{the functioning of the}} Internal Market. For this reason, cities are often actors in judicial proceedings before the European courts. The Lisbon Treaty has revived the judiciability of the subsidiarity principle by giving new powers to subnational actors to participate in the formation of EU law. Yet even though policy-makers promote local participation and democracy, judges, in striking down or upholding local welfare policies that conflict with Internal Market rules, have rendered cities <b>invisible.</b> In <b>balancing</b> conflicting EU versus Member States interests as two autonomous and independent spheres of power, European judges rely on a fiction of non-intervention in state-local matters. In their decisions, city interests are either subsumed into State or EU goals, or they are reduced to private market actors. Cities have traditionally been seats of civilization and flourishing of an integrated Europe but with the Internal Market, they have necessarily taken a back seat. To redress the balance, judges should address the fact that what is decided in Luxembourg inevitably affects the redistribution of power and resources in state-local relations. By exposing the interdependence between the powers of the Union, its Member States and the plurality of cities that constitute them, such process will create greater democratic accountability in the Internal Market jurisprudence...|$|R
40|$|It is commonplace to link neoclassical {{economics}} to 18 th- or 19 th-century {{physics and}} its notion of equilibrium, of a pendulum once disturbed eventually coming to rest. Likewise, an economy subjected to an exogenous shock seeks equilibrium through the stabilizing market forces unleashed by the invisible hand. The metaphor {{can be applied}} to virtually every sphere of economics: from micro markets for fish that are traded spot, to macro markets for something called labor, and on to complex financial markets in synthetic collateralized debt obligations - CDOs. Guided by <b>invisible</b> hands, supplies <b>balance</b> demands and markets clear. Armed with metaphors from physics, the economist has no problem at all extending the analysis across international borders to traded commodities, to what are euphemistically called capital flows, and on to currencies themselves. Certainly there is a price, somewhere, somehow, that will balance supply and demand. The orthodox economist is sure that if we just get the government out of the way, the market will do the dirty work. The heterodox economist? Well, she is less sure. The market might not work. It needs a bit of coaxing. Imbalances can persist. Market forces can be rather impotent. The visible hand of government can hasten the move toward balance. Orthodox economists as well as most heterodox economists see the Global Financial Crisis as a consequence of domestic and global imbalances. The most common story blames the US Federal Reserve for excessive monetary ease that spurred borrowing, and the US fiscal and trade imbalances for a surplus of liquidity sloshing around global financial markets. Looking to the specific problems in Euroland, the imbalances are attributed to profligate Mediterraneans. The solution is to restore global balance, which requires some combination of higher exchange rates for the Chinese, reduction of US trade deficits, and Teutonic fiscal discipline in the United States, the UK, and Japan, {{as well as on the}} periphery of Europe. This paper takes an alternative view, following the sectoral balances approach of Wynne Godley, combined with the modern money theory (MMT) approach derived from the work of Innes, Knapp, Keynes, Lerner, and Minsky. The problem is not one of financial imbalance, but rather one of an imbalance of power. There is too much power in the hands of the financial sector, money managers, the predator state, and Europe 2 ̆ 019 s center. There is too much privatization and pursuit of the private purpose, and too little use of government to serve the public interest. In short, there is too much neoliberalism and too little democracy, transparency, and accountability of government...|$|R
