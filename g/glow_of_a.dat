5|$|A {{number of}} {{residents}} on farming properties {{to the west}} of York heard a large aircraft flying low over the area. The aircraft seemed to be in trouble because the noise from the engines was changing significantly. At times the engines seemed to be operating normally but on at least one occasion all engine noise ceased for a brief time and then returned as a very loud, high-pitched noise. One resident reported that when all engine noise ceased he could hear a rushing sound until the scream from the engines returned. Several residents reported seeing a bright flash of white light in the distance, followed by a loud crashing and scraping noise. Those closest to the crash could then see the yellow <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> major fire.|$|E
25|$|The <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flame is complex. Black-body {{radiation}} is emitted from soot, gas, and fuel particles, though the soot particles {{are too small}} to behave like perfect blackbodies. There is also photon emission by de-excited atoms and molecules in the gases. Much of the {{radiation is}} emitted in the visible and infrared bands. The color depends on temperature for the black-body radiation, and on chemical makeup for the emission spectra. The dominant color in a flame changes with temperature. The photo of the forest fire in Canada is an excellent example of this variation. Near the ground, where most burning is occurring, the fire is white, the hottest color possible for organic material in general, or yellow. Above the yellow region, the color changes to orange, which is cooler, then red, which is cooler still. Above the red region, combustion no longer occurs, and the uncombusted carbon particles are visible as black smoke.|$|E
500|$|When {{depicting}} {{life in the}} projects, Nas alternates from {{moments of}} pain and pleasure to frustration and braggadocio. The columnist for OhWord.com wrote: [...] " [...] narrative voice swerves between personas that are cynical and optimistic, naïve and world-weary, enraged and serene, globally conscious and provincial". Music writer Jeff Weiss of Pitchfork describes the [...] "enduring image" [...] often associated with Nas's narrated stream of consciousness: [...] " [...] baby-faced Buddha monk in public housing, scribbling lotto dreams and grim reaper nightmares in dollar notebooks, words enjambed in the margins. The only light is the orange <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> blunt, bodega liquor, and the adolescent rush of first creation. Sometimes his pen taps the paper and his brain blanks. In the next sentence, he remembers dark streets and the noose." [...] Critic and blogger Kenny Waste comments on the significance of Queensbridge as a setting in Illmatic, writing, “The songs are made up largely of recollections or Nas describing his emotions, which range from feeling trapped to overt optimism about his abilities to escape the 'hands of doom'. But they always remain {{within the walls of}} his Queensbridge home.” ...|$|E

500|$|Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars, saying [...] "The film may be animated, and largely taken up with rats, but its pulse is gratifyingly human. And you {{have never seen a}} computer-animated feature with this sort of visual panache and detail." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "So many computer-animated movies are brash, loud and popping with pop-culture comedy, but Ratatouille has the warm <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{favorite}} book. The characters are {{more than the sum of}} their gigabyte-consuming parts – they feel handcrafted." [...] Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "Has Pixar lost its magic recipe? Ratatouille is filled with fairly generic animated imagery, a few modest chases, a couple of good gags, not a lot of laughs." [...] Scott Foundas of LA Weekly gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Bird has taken the raw ingredients of an anthropomorphic-animal kiddie matinee and whipped them into a heady brew about nothing less than the principles of artistic creation." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "It's not just the computer animation that is vibrantly three-dimensional. It's also the well-rounded characters... I defy you to name another animated film so overflowing with superfluous beauty." [...] Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "With Ratatouille, Bird once again delivers not just a great, witty story, but dazzling visuals as well." [...] Bill Muller of The Arizona Republic gave the film four and a half stars out of five, saying [...] "Like the burbling soup that plays a key part in Ratatouille, the movie is a delectable blend of ingredients that tickles the palette and leaves you hungry for more." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 18 Scorpii is a main {{sequence}} star of spectral and luminosity type G2Va, with the luminosity class of 'V' indicating it is generating energy through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in its core region. Sousa et al. (2008) found its metallicity {{to be about}} 1.1 {{times that of the}} Sun, which means the abundance of elements other than hydrogen or helium is 10% greater. The radius of this star, as measured using interferometry by Bazot et al. (2011), is 101% the radius of the Sun. When combined with the results of asteroseismology measurements, this allows the mass of the star to be estimated as 102% of the Sun's mass. This star is radiating 106% of the Sun's luminosity from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 5,433K. It is this heat that gives the star the yellow-hued <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> G-type star.|$|E
50|$|The stellar {{classification}} {{of the primary}} star is F7 V, which means it is a main sequence star like the Sun. It is some 2.8 billion years old and shines with 3.66 times the Sun's luminosity.

2500|$|In 1843, the Act for Regulating the Theatres {{came into}} force, {{bringing}} {{an end to}} the monopolies of the two existing companies and, by doing so, increased the number of theatres in London. At the same time, the fashion in theatre was [...] "pictorial": valuing visual spectacle above plot or characterisation and often required lengthy (and time consuming) scene changes. For example, Henry Irving's 1892 King Lear offered spectacles such as Lear's death beneath a cliff at Dover, his face lit by the red <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> setting sun; at the expense of cutting 46% of the text, including the blinding of Gloucester. But Irving's production clearly evoked strong emotions: one spectator, Gordon Crosse, wrote of the first entrance of Lear, [...] "a striking figure with masses of white hair. He is leaning on a huge scabbarded sword which he raises with a wild cry in answer to the shouted greeting of his guards. His gait, his looks, his gestures, all reveal the noble, imperious mind already degenerating into senile irritability under the coming shocks of grief and age." ...|$|E

50|$|The main {{component}} has <b>a</b> stellar classification <b>of</b> F1 V, {{which indicates}} {{that it is an}} F-type main sequence star. This star has 55% more mass than the Sun.
