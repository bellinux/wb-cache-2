40|$|Over {{the last}} decade life-course {{arrangements}} have been introduced in several EU Member States {{with the aim of}} enhancing in a coherent way individual flexibility and employability over an employee's whole working life. In this article we examine the effects of existing schemes with a life-course dimension in terms of employability, comparing four schemes in three countries. The conclusion we arrive at is that the schemes are mainly used for early retirement or achieving short-term benefits, while the uptake of provisions specifically related to employability is not very high. More attractive forms of working-life accounts should refocus on easily accessible basic schemes with short-term objectives and endowed with a sufficient budget for achieving long-term employability goals. They need to be underpinned and supplemented by collectively bargained company-level agreements. © <b>European</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Union</b> <b>Institute</b> 2011...|$|E
40|$|This {{report on}} Maltese trade unions forms {{part of a}} wide-ranging project, {{initiated}} and coordinated by the <b>European</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Union</b> <b>Institute</b> (ETUI), which aims to map changes in unionisation and the varying organisational structures of unions in the ‘New Member States’ (NMS) of the European Union (EU). Although there is a burgeoning literature on {{the present and future}} prospects of unionism which includes some of the countries in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) (for example, Gall 2009; Phelan 2009, 2007), trade union morphology in these countries is rarely studied. Moreover, the smaller countries are often omitted, as are the Mediterranean islands – and since 2004, EU member states – of Cyprus and Malta. While rigorously scrutinised data on union development are available for almost all countries that joined the EU before 2004, basic information on trade unions in the NMS is largely lacking. This {{is not to say that}} no data are available on union membership and structure for the NMS. N/...|$|E
