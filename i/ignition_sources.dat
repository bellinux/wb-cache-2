After ramming, the cannon would be aimed with the elevation set using a quadrant and a plummet. At 45 degrees, the ball had the utmost range: about ten times the gun's level range. Any angle above a horizontal line was called random-shot. Wet sponges were used to cool the pieces every ten or twelve rounds.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} how, {{and to what}} extent, {{the following}} factors influence burn damage: (1) the angle of application of the <b>ignition</b> <b>source</b> to the sample surface, and (2) the flow rate for the <b>ignition</b> <b>source,</b> when assessing samples in accordance with ISO 8191 - 2 : 1988. Varying the <b>ignition</b> <b>source</b> flow rate and the angle of application of the <b>ignition</b> <b>source</b> to the sample undergoing testing, which are both variations on the existing procedure outlined in the Standard ISO 8191 - 2 : 1988. Burn damage {{as measured by the}} depth (if applicable) and greatest horizontal and vertical dimensions. Increasing the <b>ignition</b> <b>source</b> gas flow rate (from 45 ml/min to 240 ml/min) increased the measured burn damage for both foam and vinyl samples. The increased damage factor was at least two-fold (and up to five-fold). Changing the angle of application of the <b>ignition</b> <b>source</b> (45 ° compared to 0 °) did not significantly affect the measured burn damage for either sample. These findings indicate that the direction of application of a match-flame equivalent <b>ignition</b> <b>source</b> has no significant affect on the resulting burn damage, but that increasing the <b>ignition</b> <b>source</b> flow rate increases the burn damage for both foam and vinyl samples...|$|R

50|$|The {{flash point}} may {{sometimes}} {{be confused with}} the autoignition temperature, which is the temperature at which the vapor ignites spontaneously without an <b>ignition</b> <b>source.</b> The fire point is the lowest temperature at which vapors of the material will keep burning after being ignited and the <b>ignition</b> <b>source</b> removed. The fire point is higher than the flash point, because at the flash point more vapor may not be produced rapidly enough to sustain combustion. Neither flash point nor fire point depends directly on the <b>ignition</b> <b>source</b> temperature, but it may be understood that <b>ignition</b> <b>source</b> temperature will be considerably higher than either the flash or fire point.|$|R

2500|$|Although it {{is common}} in the climate models to {{consider}} city firestorms, these need not be ignited by nuclear devices; more conventional <b>ignition</b> <b>sources</b> can instead be the spark of the firestorms. Prior to the previously mentioned solar heating effect, the soot's injection height {{is controlled by the}} rate of energy release from the firestorm's fuel, not the size of an initial nuclear explosion. For example, the mushroom cloud from the bomb dropped on Hiroshima reached a height of six kilometers (middle troposphere) within a few minutes and then dissipated due to winds, while the individual fires [...] within the city took almost three hours to form into a firestorm and produce a pyrocumulus cloud, a cloud that is assumed to have reached upper tropospheric heights, as over its multiple hours of burning, the firestorm released an estimated 1000 times the energy of the bomb.|$|E
2500|$|Nuclear weapons emit {{large amounts}} of thermal {{radiation}} as visible, infrared, and ultraviolet light, to which the atmosphere is largely transparent. This is known as [...] "Flash". The chief hazards are burns and eye injuries. On clear days, these injuries can occur well beyond blast ranges, depending on weapon yield. Fires may also be started by the initial thermal radiation, but the following high winds due to the blast wave may put out almost all such fires, unless the yield is very high, where the range of thermal effects vastly out ranges blast effects, as observed from explosions in the multi-megaton range. [...] This is because {{the intensity of the}} blast effects drops off with the third power of distance from the explosion, while the intensity of radiation effects drops off with the second power of distance. This results in the range of thermal effects increasing markedly more than blast range as higher and higher device yields are detonated. Thermal radiation accounts for between 35–45% of the energy released in the explosion, depending on the yield of the device. In urban areas, the extinguishing of fires ignited by thermal radiation may matter little, as in a surprise attack fires may also be started by blast-effect-induced electrical shorts, gas pilot lights, overturned stoves, and other <b>ignition</b> <b>sources,</b> {{as was the case in}} the breakfast-time bombing of Hiroshima. Whether or not these secondary fires will in turn themselves be snuffed out as modern noncombustible brick and concrete buildings collapse in on themselves from the same blast wave is uncertain, not least of which, because of the masking effect of modern city landscapes on thermal and blast transmission are continually examined.|$|E

40|$|The {{fires and}} explosions caused by {{flammable}} hydrocarbon air mixtures {{are a major}} safety concern in the chemical and processing industries. The thermo-physical and chemical properties of the flammable fuels in a hybrid form {{appear to have a}} significant impact on the combustion process. This usually occurs due to substantial changes in the flammability concentration regimes. The aim of this study is to investigate the fire and explosive properties of hybrid fuels in the chemical and process industries. In addition, it examines the impact of the ignition energy and vessel geometry on the magnitude of the pressure rise and flame propagation velocity. The experimental work was conducted on a cylindrically shaped explosion chamber constructed as part of this study at The University of Newcastle, Australia. The chamber was made of mild steel and was 30 m in length and 0. 5 in diameter. It included a series of high resolution pressure transducers, a pyrometer, as well as a high speed video camera. Methane and coal dust were used as fuels and chemical igniters with a known energy were used to ignite the fuels. The results obtained from this study showed that both the ignition energy and the diluted combustible fuel dust have significant impacts on the Over Pressure Rise (OPR) in an explosion chamber. The significant findings included that the OPR doubled when 30 g m- 3 of coal dust was added to a 6 % methane/air mixture, and it increased by 60 % when 10 kJ was used instead of a 1 kJ <b>ignition</b> <b>source.</b> The initial <b>ignition</b> energy was observed to considerably enhance the speed of both the pressure wave and the flame front, where the pressure wave speed doubled when using a 5 kJ instead of a 1 kJ <b>ignition</b> <b>source.</b> However, the pressure wave speed increased by five times when a 10 kJ was used instead of a 1 kJ <b>ignition</b> <b>source.</b> Additionally, the maximum flame front velocity observed for the <b>ignition</b> <b>source</b> with 5 kJ energy was twice the flame front velocity for the 1 kJ <b>ignition</b> <b>source.</b> Finally, it was observed that the time needed for the initial methane ignition was reduced by about 50 % when using a 10 kJ instead of a 1 kJ <b>ignition</b> <b>source...</b>|$|R
