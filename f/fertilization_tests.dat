40|$|The {{population}} growth and the increasing demand of animal source foods {{have contributed to the}} intensification of cattle production systems. The use of cattle manure as fertilizer in agricultural soils is an important source of metals, mainly due to the added in high rates of core mineral in animal feed in confined production systems, have resulted in corresponding rise of trace elements in manure. In cattle grazing systems, the natural sources of minerals include forage and water. Therefore, the use of organic amendments rich in trace elements for the forage employed in animal nutrition is an alternative to the mineral supplementation by intravenous injection. The main goal of this PhD Thesis was to evaluate the enrichment of forages with micronutrients by means of organic amendment and the corresponding absorption by ruminants. The {{results of the present study}} are presented in several chapters:a) Micronutrients in cattle manure coming from intensive production systems. In this Chapter, the evolution of the cattle industry towards the intensification of production systems was evaluated. In addition, the general characteristics of the intensive production systems and its effect on the composition of the manure were analysed, with special focus on the total content and bioavailability of micronutrients (Cu, Zn, Co and Mo). b) Micronutrients deficiency in extensive livestock production systems. In this Chapter the relevant sources of mineral deficiency were reviewed and some common deficiency cases in our country were described. Moreover, the total content and availability of micronutrients (Cu, Zn, Co, Mo and Se) were determined in soils corresponding to areas with mineral deficiency from Buenos Aires province. c) Forage enrichment with micronutrients: experience in plant pot and plot. In this Chapter the results from sowing tests were presented. In these tests, excrement coming from intensive production systems containing high concentration of micronutrients (Cu and Zn) was employed as organic amendment. d) Micronutrient metabolism in ruminants. In this Chapter, the release of minerals (Cu and Zn) in the rumen was evaluated by employing different forage mixtures with and without micronutrients fertilization. The obtained results in the different tests conducted during this study led to the following conclusions: - The cattle manure coming from intensive production systems presented high total content of Cu and Zn related with the feed consumed by livestock. The sequential extraction for the speciation of these trace metals revealed a higher percentage of the soluble or exchangeable fractions compared with excrement obtained from extensive production systems without the use of mineral supplements. - The soil samples analysed presented Cu, Zn and Se concentration close to the lower limit of the normal range for agricultural land. The aforementioned samples were obtained from the Pampa area where a deficiency of such metals was reported. In addition, the sequential extraction showed that these soil samples contained low concentration of bioavailable Cu, Co and Mo whereas the concentration of bioavailable Zn changed significantly among the different samples measured. - The fertilization in plant pot showed positive results from the addition of cattle manure as organic amendments. An increase in the percentage of dry matter and an improvement in the growing parameters of the forage species employed were observed (Lolium Perenne and Trifolium Repens). - The addition of intensive cattle manure led to an increase in Cu and Zn concentration in the foliar biomass of the forage species analysed after 30 days from the sowing time. The increased uptake is favoured by the higher total content and the higher percentage of soluble fraction of such trace metals, provided by the excrement addition. - The results obtained in the <b>fertilization</b> <b>tests</b> showed the enrichment in Cu and Zn in the forages treated with excrement from intensive systems after 30 days from the sowing. - Besides, the response to the fertilization with organic amendments was better compared with the use of inorganic fertilizers (CuSO 4 ? ZnSO 4), regardless of the employed dosage. - The use of cattle manure coming from intensive production systems as fertilizers promoted the mobility and gradual release of trace elements from lower bioavailable fractions for plants (such as the fraction of metal complexed to organic matter or the inorganic fraction) obtained by sequential extraction. - The addition strategy, doses and persistence in the soils of CuSO 4 and ZnSO 4 are variables that influenced the incorporation of trace metals in the forages. - The forage samples obtained in the tests conducted in plots 30 days after the different fertilizer treatments presented a concentration of Cu and Zn that would be adequate to cover the metal trace requirements in beef cattle. However, other variables concerning the animal and the diet should be considered. - Later sowing times (90 days after the treatment) showed variable results to the addition of organic amendments and inorganic fertilization. - The lower concentration of Cu and Zn in the foliar biomass measured at later sowing times for all the different fertilization treatments could be explained by the growing dynamics of the forage species, the aging of plant tissues and defoliation process. - The ruminal incubation of fresh forages (enriched with CuSO 4 and ZnSO 4 and without fertilization) showed high percentages of total dry matter degradability and high release percentages of Cu and Zn into the rumen at short incubation times (3 ? 9 h). Drying of the forage samples in an oven led to a decrease in the dry matter degradability modifying the subsequent bioavailability of the nutrients. The use of cattle manure coming from intensive production systems as fertilizer contributed the uptake of Cu and Zn in forage species mainly due to the higher concentration and the higher content of bioavailable fractions of such trace metals in soils. Therefore, the use of those organic amendments reduces the risk of environmental pollution due to the excess of micronutrients. In addition, Cu and Zn deficiencies could be balanced in different cattle production areas. The micronutrients contribution to forage can supply the required minerals for cattle production, favoured by the high level of trace elements release in the rumen. Fil: Ramos, María Laura. Universidad de Buenos Aires. Facultad de Ciencias Veterinarias. Buenos Aires, ArgentinaEl crecimiento demográfico y la creciente demanda de alimentos de origen animal han originado una intensificación de los sistemas de producción ganadera. La aplicación de excretas de feedlot como fertilizantes a suelos agrícolas es una fuente relevante de incorporación de metales al suelo, debido principalmente a la suplementación mineral en las raciones de los animales engordados en confinamiento. En los sistemas pastoriles de producción ganadera, los proveedores naturales de minerales son las pasturas y el agua de bebida. Por lo tanto, la fertilización de los forrajes que consumen los bovinos con enmiendas orgánicas ricas en elementos traza, se presenta como una alternativa a la suplementación animal de minerales usualmente realizada vía sistémica. El objetivo general del presente trabajo de Tesis Doctoral ha sido evaluar el enriquecimiento de forrajes destinados a rumiantes con micronutrientes mediante la aplicación de enmiendas orgánicas y su absorción a nivel ruminal. Los contenidos del trabajo de tesis incluyen: a) Micronutrientes en excretas de sistemas intensivo de engorde bovino. En este Capítulo se evaluó en primer lugar, la evolución de la ganadería hacia la intensificación de sistemas ganaderos. Posteriormente se analizaron características generales de los sistemas intensivos de producción, producción de excretas y análisis de su composición, haciendo énfasis en el contenido total y biodisponibilidad de micronutrientes (Cu, Zn, Co y Mo). b) Carencia de micronutrientes en sistemas extensivos de ganadería bovina. En este Capítulo se realizó una revisión de los factores determinantes de carencias minerales y una descripción de los cuadros carenciales de presentación frecuente en nuestro país. Así mismo, se evaluó el contenido total y la biodisponibilidad de micronutrientes (Cu, Zn, Co, Mo y Se) en suelos de la provincia de Buenos Aires donde fue reportada la carencia. c) Enriquecimiento de forrajes con micronutrientes: prueba preliminar de fertilización en microcosmos y ensayo en parcelas. En estos capítulos, se presentan ensayos de fertilización, donde se utilizan excretas provenientes de sistemas intensivos de producción, ricas en micronutrientes (Cu y Zn), como enmiendas orgánicas. d) Metabolismo de micronutrientes en rumiantes. En este Capítulo se evalúa la liberación en rumen de elementos minerales (Cu y Zn), a partir de mezclas forrajeras con y sin tratamiento de fertilización con micronutrientes. Los resultados obtenidos a partir de los estudios realizados permiten concluir: - Las excretas provenientes de sistemas intensivos de producción bovina, presentan altos contenidos totales de Cu y Zn provenientes de la dieta. A partir del fraccionamiento secuencial de las mismas; se determinó un mayor porcentaje de fracción soluble o intercambiable de elementos traza respecto de excretas provenientes de sistemas extensivos de producción sin suplementación mineral. - Las muestras de suelos analizadas, presentaron valores de concentración total Cu, Zn y Se cercanos al límite inferior del rango considerado normal para suelos agrícolas, perteneciendo las mismas a zonas de la Región Pampeana donde se reportó la carencia de dichos minerales. Así mismo, a partir del fraccionamiento secuencial, se determinó que las muestras de suelo analizadas presentaron baja disponibilidad de Cu, Co y Mo; mientras que para Zn la biodisponibilidad vario considerablemente entre las distintas muestras. - A partir de la prueba preliminar de fertilización en macetas, se obtuvieron respuestas positivas al agregado de excretas como enmiendas orgánicas, habiéndose observado un incremento en el porcentaje de materia seca determinada por maceta, y una mejora en los parámetros de crecimientos de las especies forrajeras utilizadas (raigrás perenne y trébol blanco). - La incorporación de excretas provenientes de sistemas intensivo de producción, permite incrementar las concentraciones de Cu y Zn en la biomasa foliar de las especies forrajeras analizadas, 30 días post siembra de las mismas. Esta mayor asimilación de dichos metales traza, se ve favorecido por el mayor contenido total y mayor porcentaje de fracción soluble de dichos metales traza, aportado por las excretas a los suelos. - A partir de los resultados obtenidos del ensayo de fertilización en parcelas, se pudo corroborar el enriquecimiento de Cu y Zn en forrajes implantados a partir del agregado de excretas intensivas a los 30 días post aplicación de las mismas. - Así mismo, se obtuvieron mejores respuestas a la fertilización con enmiendas orgánicas respecto al uso de fertilizantes inorgánicos (CuSO 4 ? ZnSO 4), independientemente de la dosis utilizada. - La aplicación de excretas provenientes de sistemas intensivos a los suelos como fertilizantes, promueve un efecto sobre la movilidad y liberación gradual de elementos traza desde fracciones menos disponibles para las plantas (como las fracción unida a materia orgánica e fracción inorgánica) obtenidas por fraccionamiento secuencial. - La forma de aplicación, dosis y persistencias de sulfato de Cu y sulfato de Zn en los suelos luego de su aplicación, son factores que condicionan incorporación de dichos elementos trazas a los forrajes. - Las concentraciones determinadas de Cu y Zn en las muestras de forrajes obtenidas en las experiencias en parcelas 30 post aplicación de los diferentes tratamientos de fertilización, permitirían cubrir los requerimientos de dichos micronutrientes en bovinos de carne, debiendo también considerarse factores del animal y del alimento. - A tiempos de cosecha más tardíos (90 días pos aplicación de los tratamientos), se obtuvieron respuestas variables a la aplicación de enmiendas orgánicas y fuentes inorgánicas de fertilización. - La dinámica de crecimiento de las especies forrajeras, el envejecimiento de los tejidos de las plantas y la defoliación pueden explicar las menores concentraciones de Cu y Zn en la biomasa foliar a tiempos más tardíos de cosecha independientemente del tratamiento de fertilización aplicado. - La incubación ruminal de forrajes frescos (enriquecidos en Cu y Zn, y sin fertilización) mostró altos porcentajes de degradabilidad de la materia seca total acompañado por altos porcentajes de liberación de Cu y Zn al medio ruminal a tiempos cortos de incubación (3 ? 9 horas). El secado en estufa de las muestras de forraje disminuye la degradabilidad de la materia seca incubada afectando la disponibilidad posterior de nutrientes contenidos en el alimento. La aplicación de excretas provenientes de sistemas intensivos de producción bovina como fertilizantes, favorece la incorporación de Cu y Zn en especies forrajeras debido principalmente a los mayores contenidos y aporte de formas biodisponibles de dichos metales a los suelos. De esta forma, la reutilización de dichas enmiendas orgánicas disminuye el peligro potencial de contaminación ambiental a partir del excedente de micronutrientes eliminados en excretas; como así también permite compensar carencias de Cu y Zn en zonas de cría de ganado vacuno. El aporte de micronutrientes a partir de los forrajes, permite cubrir los requerimientos minerales del ganado vacuno; hecho favorecido por la alta tasa de liberación ruminal de elementos traza a partir de los mismos...|$|E

Macros were designed {{for the application of}} the Image Analysis System in quantitative measurements of enzyme reactions. The activity of G- 6 -PDH, the key enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway, was determined in kinetic experiments. The major activity of G- 6 -PDH was localized in the cortical region of the sea urchin oocyte. The results indicate that the enzyme is regulated by the concentration of NADP+.

40|$|Numerous field {{experiments}} were conducted at {{a wide range}} of sites in Arizona from 1988 through 1999 involving phosphate (P) fertilization of cotton (Gossypium spp.). A total of 21 site-years were used to study the effects of P on both Upland (G. hirsutum L.) and Pima (G. barbadense L.) varieties. The purpose of these experiments was to evaluate University of Arizona (UA) soil fertility guidelines with respect to soil test results (NaHCO 3 extractable P) and to possibly fine-tune or calibrate these guidelines in relation to soil test P, applied P, and yield for common Arizona soils used in cotton production. Results from these experiments, based on soil test information, plant measurements, and lint yield showed no significant difference (P 0. 05) due to treatments for all the studies {{with the exception of one}} P study conducted in Graham County in 1998 and another P study conducted in Pinal County in 1999. The 1998 Graham County site had a preseason soil test value of 7. 6 ppm NaHCO 3 extractable P. The 1999 Pinal County site had a preseason soil test value of 3. 0 ppm NaHCO 3 extractable P. Analysis of yield results vs. soil P show that soil test P levels greater than 5 ppm are consistently sufficient for both Upland and Pima cotton. Yield results vs. applied P (lbs. P 2 O 5 /acre) for both Upland and Pima did not indicate a positive response over the rates of <b>fertilization</b> <b>tested</b> (20 - 160 lbs. P 2 O 5 /acre). Based on the results from these studies, the current UA soil fertility guidelines for P fertilization of cotton appear to be valid. Furthermore, the data indicates that the UA soil fertility guidelines may be further refined to provide the following categories: 10 ppm = low probability of response to an added P fertilization...|$|R
40|$|Anthurium andraeanum flowers {{quality and}} {{productivity}} {{depend on the}} fertilizer, and the growing media used. Most Brazilian anthurium growers use to prepare their growing media, {{but they do not}} realize that the low quality and productivity might come from an inadequate mix that they are using. So, the objective was to determine yield and flower quality of anthurium plants grown in different growing media and fertilizations. 'Eidibel' anthurium plants were grown in: a) pine bark + composted organic matter (1 : 1); b) wood shavings + composted organic matter (1 : 1); c) growing media usually utilized by the grower where this study was developed (a mixture of soil, coal residue and composted cow manure). Four fertigation solutions were applied weekly during eleven months. These solutions were: NPK 100 % (5. 00 : 1. 64 : 3. 12 g plant- 1 year- 1); N and K 100 % + P 150 % (5. 00 : 2. 46 : 3. 12 g plant- 1 year- 1); N and P 100 % + K 150 % (5. 00 : 1. 64 : 4. 70 g plant- 1 year- 1); N 100 % + P and K 150 % (5. 00 : 2. 46 : 4. 70 g plant- 1 year- 1). These were compared with monthly fertilization done locally with slow releasing solid fertilizer (4. 52 : 1. 23 : 4. 99 g plant- 1 year- 1). Although there was no increase in the yield, represented by the number of flowers produced per plant, the growing media prepared with wood shavings + organic compost (1 : 1) with all <b>fertilization</b> <b>tested</b> produced the best quality anthurium cut flowers (Extra and Class I) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{collection}} of sperm samples by electroejaculation (EE) {{leads to an}} increase of the production of seminal plasma which could modify the tolerance of spermatozoa to the cryopreservation procedure. This study aims to compare a standard sperm cryopreservation protocol for samples collected by artificial vagina (AV) with the same protocol and modifications to this for samples obtained by EE. Semen from six males of Blanca-Celtibérica goat breed was collected by AV (control) and EE, and three experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, it was {{examined the effects of}} egg yolk concentration contained in freezing extender (0 %, 1. 5 %, 10 % and 20 % of egg yolk); in Experiment 2, it was evaluated the cooling rate from 30 to 5 °C (fast: 10 min and slow: 90 min) and the temperature of glycerol addition (30 and 5 °C); and in Experiment 3, it was examined the time of equilibration at 5 °C (0, 1, 2 or 3 h). A heterologous in vitro <b>fertilization</b> <b>test</b> was carried out in order to compare the fertility of control samples with that resulting from the EE protocol which showed the highest sperm quality. Results showed greater sperm motility parameters after thawing for control samples cryopreserved in standard conditions in the three experiments. For samples collected by EE, extender with 20 % egg yolk, a slow cooling rate and a longer equilibration time (3 h) provided higher sperm quality, and no differences were observed between temperatures of glycerol addition. Samples collected by EE and cryopreserved with the protocol which yielded the best sperm quality after thawing showed higher fertility compared to AV.

40|$|Soybean {{lecithin}} {{may represent}} a suitable alternative to egg yolk for semen cryopreservation in livestock species. However, additional {{studies are needed to}} elucidate its effects on spermatozoa functional properties. Semen collected from five Sarda bucks was cryopreserved in Tris-based extender and glycerol (4 % v:v) with different supplementations. In a preliminary experiment, different soybean lecithin concentrations were tested (1 %– 6 % wt/vol) and results in terms of viability, percentages of progressive motile and rapid spermatozoa, and DNA integrity after thawing showed that the most effective concentration was 1 %. In the second experiment, semen was frozen in a Tris-based extender with no supplementation (EXT), with 1 % lecithin (EXT LC), and 20 % egg yolk (EXT EY). The effectiveness of these extenders was also compared with a commercial extender. The EXT EY led to the highest viability and motility parameters after freezing and thawing (P < 0. 0001). No significant differences were observed in intracellular ATP concentrations. Additional molecular features revealed that sperm functionality was affected in EXT EY, as demonstrated by lower DNA and acrosome integrity (P < 0. 05), and higher lipid peroxidation compared with spermatozoa cryopreserved in EXT LC (P < 0. 0001). Results obtained in the heterologous in vitro <b>fertilization</b> <b>test</b> showed that EXT LC better preserved spermatozoa functionality, as demonstrated by the higher fertilization rates compared with the other media (66. 2 ± 4. 5 % for EXT LC vs. 32. 7 ± 4. 5 %, 38. 7 ± 4. 5 %, 39. 6 ± 5. 2 % for EXT, EXT EY, and commercial extender; P < 0. 01). The present study demonstrated that lecithin can be considered as a suitable alternative to egg yolk in goat semen cryopreservation, because it ensures higher fertilization rates and a better protection from membrane damage by cold shock...|$|R

40|$|In 1970, {{approximately}} 2000 m 3 of Bunker C {{crude oil}} impacted 300 km of Nova Scotia's coastline following the grounding of the tanker Arrow. Only 10 % of the contaminated coast {{was subjected to}} cleanup, the remainder was left to cleanse naturally. To determine the long-term environmental impact of residual oil from this spill event, samples of sediment and interstitial water were recovered in 1993, 1997 and 2000 from a sheltered lagoon in Black Duck Cove. This heavily oiled site was intentionally left to recover on its own. Visual observations and chemical analysis confirmed that substantial quantities of the weathered cargo oil were still present within the sediments at this site. However, direct observations of benthic invertebrate abundance suggest that natural processes have reduced the impacts of the residual oil. To confirm this hypothesis, sediment and interstitial water samples from Black Duck Cove were assessed with a comprehensive set of biotests and chemical assays. Residual oil in the sediments had limited effect on hepatic CYP 1 A protein levels and mixed function oxygenase (MFO) induction in winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus). No toxicity was detected with the Microtox solid phase test (Vibrio fischeri). Significant sediment toxicity was detected by the amphipod survival test (Eohaustorius estuarius) in four out of the eight contaminated sediments. Interstitial water samples were deemed non-toxic by the Microtox 100 % test (Vibrio fischeri) and the echinoid <b>fertilization</b> <b>test</b> (Lytechinus pictus). Sediment elutriates were also found to be non-toxic in the grass shrimp embryo-larval toxicity (GSELTOX) test (Palaemonetes pugio). Recovery at this contaminated site is attributed to natural processes that mediated biodegradation and physical removal of oil from the sediments. In support of the latter mechanism, mineralization experiments showed that all test sediments had the capacity for hexadecane, octacosane and naphthalene degradation, while chemical analysis confirmed that the Bunker C oil from the Arrow had undergone substantial biodegradation.

40|$|Understanding {{fertility}} {{management and}} the potential role of legumes in smallholder agroecosystems assists in promoting sustainable intensification of these systems. We used field-level nutrient mass balances in Bolivian mountain croplivestock systems to understand drivers of nutrient cycling and gradients in soil fertility created by these drivers. Experiments with legumes and phosphorus (P) <b>fertilization</b> <b>tested</b> the response of legume attributes like nitrogen (N) fixation and residue quality to these gradients, with and without P fertilization. Legumes were fertilized with Bolivian Capinota rock phosphate and soluble P to assess soil conditions where added P would improve legume impacts. Field nutrient balances showed that manuring rates, rangeland productivity, and soil erosion were dominant drivers of soil nutrient trends. Fields near to communities received more manure and were less steep than far fields, resulting in more positive near field balances. Mean potassium (K) trends were negative due to tuber crop harvests and export of crop residues as forage. Across 17 experiment fields, four principal components encompassed 87 % of site soil variation: P fertility and pH; organic matter; texture; and calcium phosphate (Ca-P) levels/ elevation. Phosphorus fertility was higher in near than far fields, mirroring near/far contrasts in nutrient balances. In the experiment, legumes differed in adaptation to elevation and soil type. However P fertility was the strongest driver of legume attributes. Legumes at P-fertile sites {{were more likely to}} improve soil nutrient cycling via attributes such as N fixed, soil cover, and microbial symbioses. Legume attributes can thus mediate degrading and restoring feedbacks to soil fertility. For N, P, biomass carbon stocks, and residue quality, legumes and forage oats (a benchmark non-N fixer) had complementary attributes for soil nutrient cycling. Soil texture and Ca-P levels determined impacts of P fertilization: the largest increases in N fixed were 67 % for RP and 150 % for TSP in soils with low levels of clay and Ca-P. Results suggest that erosion prevention, legume-grass mixes, and P fertilization giving attention to differences in soil type and elevation, would dramatically improve sustainability of nutrient management in extensive mountain agroecosystems...|$|R

For 4 out of 6 compounds, we observed a higher sensitivity of late stage zebrafish embryos for general toxicity (lethality) compared to younger embryos. Morphological defects such as edema, body curvature, delayed growth, decreased heart rate and locomotion were observed for each of the compounds tested, often at sublethal concentrations. Gene expression studies on a set of four selected genes revealed a specific regulatory pattern for the different compounds tested.

30|$|Although all <b>tested</b> <b>fertilization</b> {{treatments}} increased soybean yield, MPK {{treatment was}} considered to be the optimal fertilization strategy, which were attributed to the slow release of manure nutrients into the soil (Zhao et al. 2014). PK treatment also resulted in higher soybean yield than NPK treatment, indicating a negative effect of inorganic N fertilizer. Indeed, high available N prevents plants from providing carbon for nutrient-absorbing systems (Wei et al. 2013). Inorganic N has also been shown to inhibit biological N fixation, which provides N needed for soybean growth (Gelfand and Robertson 2015).|$|R

We screened 119 hemiclones of males for lifetime fitness then selected eight hemiclones (four of extreme high fitness and four of extreme low fitness) and mated them to virgin females. Females were then {{given the opportunity to}} remate with males of benchmark-genetic quality and their propensity to remate (fidelity) and sperm displacement scored. A female 2 ̆ 7 s fidelity and her level of sperm displacement varied depending on which hemiclone she mated first, but not on male-genetic quality. These findings indicate that female remating and sperm displacement are strongly influenced by male genotype, but provide no evidence that these traits contribute to adaptive female choice to obtain superior genes for offspring. © 2005 European Society for Evolutionary Biology...|$|R
