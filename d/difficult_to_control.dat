5|$|Advanced {{methods of}} loading were not {{foreseen}} when the ships were designed. While the new processes are more efficient, loading is more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> (it {{can take over}} an hour just to halt the operation), occasionally resulting in overloading the ship. These unexpected shocks, over time, can damage the hull's structural integrity.|$|E
5|$|Large single {{crystals}} (many cubic centimeters) can {{be grown}} by the gas transport (vapor-phase deposition), hydrothermal synthesis, or melt growth. However, because of high vapor pressure of ZnO, growth from the melt is problematic. Growth by gas transport is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>control,</b> leaving the hydrothermal method as a preference. Thin films can be produced by chemical vapor deposition, metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy, electrodeposition, pulsed laser deposition, sputtering, sol-gel synthesis, atomic layer deposition, spray pyrolysis, etc.|$|E
40|$|Perennials are {{the most}} <b>difficult</b> weeds <b>to</b> <b>control</b> in field crops. Perennial plants survive, by definition, {{for more than two}} years and usually live for many years. Most {{perennial}} plants reproduce by seeds and by structures such as runners, underground structures that are <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> eliminate. Satisfactory <b>control</b> of perennials usually requires a combination of cultural practices, herbicides and patience. This publication discusses the control of perennial broadleaf weeds...|$|R

5|$|Millepora alcicornis has no {{commercial}} uses but {{is sometimes}} kept in reef aquaria. It requires high water movement and bright light to flourish and its health can {{be judged by}} its colour, a yellow hue showing health whereas a darker brown colour can indicate too little light. It can be <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> because it grows fast and spreads over other objects in the tank.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the many}} {{diseases}} of humans {{that were found}} to be caused by viruses in the 20th century one, smallpox, has been eradicated. The diseases caused by viruses such as HIV and influenza virus have proved to be more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>control.</b> Other diseases, such as those caused by arboviruses, are presenting new challenges.|$|E
5|$|Viewers {{of early}} footage {{encouraged}} DiDuro to separate it further from Sonic, so he replaced rings with red leaves and altered the characters' abilities. Ziyo had drawn Lilac as a hedgehog, but DiDuro redesigned the character to be a dragon. Lilac's wall-jump ability {{was based on}} a similar game mechanic from Ristar. Originally, her level of energy was to be dependent on her speed, but this proved too <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although a high {{roughness}} value is often undesirable, {{it can be}} <b>difficult</b> and expensive <b>to</b> <b>control</b> in manufacturing. For example, it is <b>difficult</b> and expensive <b>to</b> <b>control</b> surface roughness of fused deposition modelling (FDM) manufactured parts. Decreasing the roughness of a surface usually increases its manufacturing cost. This often results in a trade-off between the manufacturing cost of a component and its performance in application.|$|R
50|$|Under prohibition, {{millions}} of people find it very <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> obtain <b>controlled</b> medications, particularly opiate pain-relievers.

5|$|Bacteriophages are {{viruses that}} infect {{bacteria}} and archaea. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses officially recognises 28 genera of bacteriophages {{that belong to}} 11 families. They are important in marine ecology: as the infected bacteria burst, carbon compounds are released back into the environment, which stimulates fresh organic growth. Bacteriophages are useful in scientific research because they are harmless to humans and can be studied easily. These viruses {{can be a problem}} in industries that produce food and drugs by fermentation and depend on healthy bacteria. Some bacterial infections are becoming <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> with antibiotics, so there is a growing interest in the use of bacteriophages to treat infections in humans.|$|E
5|$|Clerici {{also wrote}} several scenes {{that did not}} make the film's final cut. One of which {{depicted}} a group of Ya̧nomamö cutting off the leg of a Shamatari warrior and feeding him to piranhas in the river. This scene was to take place directly after Monroe's team rescues a smaller group of Ya̧nomamö from the Shamatari. Attempts were made to film this scene, but the underwater camera did not operate properly, and the piranha were <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>control.</b> As a result, Deodato abandoned his efforts, and still photographs taken during the scene are its only known depiction.|$|E
5|$|In many respects, the YF-22s were {{different}} from production F-22s. Contrary to the F-117 Nighthawk, which was initially <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> because of small vertical stabilizers, Lockheed over-specified the fin area on its YF-22. Therefore, the company reduced the size of those on F-22s by 20–30 percent. Lockheed recontoured {{the shape of the}} wing and stabilator trailing edges to improve aerodynamics, strength, and stealth characteristics; the wing and stabilitor sweep was reduced by 6° from 48°. Finally, to improve pilot visibility, the canopy was moved forward 7inches (178mm), and the engine intakes were moved rearward 14inches (356mm).|$|E

50|$|Centralized and {{decentralized}} systems {{offer more}} control, potentially easing administration by limiting options. Distributed systems are more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> explicitly <b>control,</b> but scale better horizontally and offer fewer points of system-wide failure.

5|$|Moreover, the {{failures}} at Sydney Harbour and Diego Suarez {{demonstrated that the}} improvements to the midget submarines made after Pearl Harbor had not increased the overall impact of the midget program. The modifications had various effects. The ability to man and deploy the midgets while the mother ships were submerged prevented the Army coastal radars from detecting the mother submarines. However, the midgets were still <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>control,</b> unstable, and prone to surfacing or diving uncontrollably. These manoeuvrability issues contributed to M-14s entanglement in the anti-submarine net, and the repeated detection of M-21 and M-24.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} have concurrent obstructive sleep apnea, a condition characterized by snoring, brief episodes of apnea (cessation of breathing) during the night, interrupted sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. In OHS, sleepiness may be worsened by elevated {{blood levels of}} carbon dioxide, which causes drowsiness ("CO2 narcosis"). Other symptoms present in both conditions are depression, and hypertension (high blood pressure) that is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> with medication. The high carbon dioxide can also cause headaches, {{which tend to be}} worsening in the morning.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers gave Empire: Total War {{universal}} acclaim; several critics commended {{it as one}} of {{the foremost}} strategy titles of recent times. Praise was bestowed upon the extensive strategic breadth, accurate historical challenges and visual effects. The real-time land battles, with a far greater focus on gunpowder weaponry than earlier Total War titles, were considered successful. Criticisms focused on shortcomings with the game's artificial intelligence and on the real-time naval battles being <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> and co-ordinate. The game was a commercial success, topping sales charts within a week of release; nevertheless, several Creative Assembly employees later commented on various issues caused by a perceived early release.|$|E

5|$|Although it was series co-creator and {{producer}} Gerry Anderson's original plan to film with actual alligators, AP Films instead acquired {{a group of}} juvenile crocodiles from a private zoo in northern England; these would double as re-sized alligators on scale model sets and water tanks. With {{the exception of a}} five-foot (1.5m) specimen, which was too aggressive to be removed from its box, the animals were three feet (0.91m) long. The crew kept the on-set water tanks heated to a suitably warm temperature and used electric shocks to induce movement from the reptiles. They were unpredictable and very <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> and film, either bathing {{in the heat of the}} studio lights or disappearing into the tanks and remaining submerged for hours. To make the crocodiles more visible to the cameras, the crew fixed them to guiding rods and co-ordinated their movements. The heavy presence of the animals in both puppet and scale model shots resulted in a closer-than-normal degree of collaboration between the puppet and effects crews.|$|E
5|$|As {{with any}} heavy industry, the {{possibility}} of serious injury or death was an everyday risk for the mine workers of the Rhondda Valley. The most notorious form of colliery disaster was the gas explosion, caused by either a buildup of methane gas or coal dust. As the mines became deeper and ventilation become more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the risk increased. The worst single incident in the Rhondda was the 1867 Ferndale disaster in which an explosion saw the loss of 178 lives. However, the major disasters only accounted for roughly 20% of overall fatalities, with individual accidents accounting {{for the bulk of}} deaths. The list below shows mining disasters which saw the loss of five or more lives during a single incident.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{population}} density of Varanasi and {{the increasing number of}} tourists, the Uttar Pradesh government and international non-governmental organisations and institutions have expressed grave concern for the pollution and pressures on infrastructure in the city, mainly the sewage, sanitation, and drainage components. Pollution of the Ganges is a particular source of worry because of the religious significance of the river, the dependence of people on it as a source of drinking water, and its prominence as a symbol of Varanasi and the city itself. The sewage problem is exacerbated by the role of the Ganges in bathing and in river traffic, which is very <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>control.</b> Because of the sewage, people using local untreated water have higher risk of contracting a range of water-borne stomach diseases.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to their}} small sizes and {{high rates of}} reproduction, thrips are <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> using {{classical}} biological control. Suitable predators must be small and slender enough to penetrate the crevices where thrips hide while feeding, and they must also prey extensively on eggs and larvae to be effective. Only two families of parasitoid Hymenoptera parasitize eggs and larvae, the Eulophidae and the Trichogrammatidae. Other biocontrol agents of adults and larvae include anthocorid bugs of genus Orius, and phytoseiid mites. Biological insecticides such as the fungi Beauveria bassiana and Verticillium lecanii can kill thrips at all life-cycle stages. Insecticidal soap spray is effective against thrips. It is commercially available or can be made of certain types of household soap. Scientists in Japan report that significant reductions in larva and adult melon thrips occur when plants are illuminated with red light.|$|E
5|$|Historical records {{report that}} Minyue and Dongyue were emptied of people, {{and that its}} {{residents}} were deported to the territories between the Huai River and the Yangtze River. The alleged population transfer was a resumption of a policy that had been planned since 138 BC. The Han government considered the mountainous region <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> and was wary of trusting its residents. Modern historians doubt the event happened. The deportation of an entire kingdom is implausible, and nothing {{has been found to}} verify a migration of Han settlers to the Minyue region around the year 1, something that would have occurred had the area been abandoned while under Han control. There was only one town of Han settlers, Dongyue, in Minyue. Dongyue was built where the Min River meets the sea, around the time of Emperor Wu's reign. It is more likely that the assimilation of Minyue into Han Chinese culture through Han conquest happened later in the dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{rebuilt the}} defence for 1993–94, signing right-back Brian Mitchell and centre-back David Thompson, and oversaw a mixed {{start to the}} season. City won four {{straight}} home matches but also lost 5–1 to West Ham, 5–0 at Newcastle, and most significantly 4–0 to local rivals Bristol Rovers at Twerton Park. He found it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the club's talented and popular players, as Dziekanowski regularly got into trouble in his social life and skilled left-winger Junior Bent was unwilling to deliver crosses as regularly as Smith demanded. He tried to sell Bent {{but was unable to}} have the deal sanctioned by the club's directors. His relationship with the board was poor and he found himself regularly undermined and sensitive boardroom discussions were leaked. He also tried to sell Cole in order to provide funds to restructure the first team but again the board refused to sanction the deal. He was dismissed on 21 January 1993 following a run of 10 matches without a victory, and his assistant Russell Osman was appointed as his successor.|$|E
