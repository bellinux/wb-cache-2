40|$|The {{incidence}} {{and severity of}} local skin reactions, {{as well as the}} impact on the local bacteriologic profile, in a 7 -day regimen of a matrix transdermal estradiol delivery system compared with placebo (a piece of adhesive tape for sensitive skin of approximately the same shape and area) were assessed in healthy postmenopausal Brazilian women in an open-label study. the matrix estradiol and placebo patches were applied to different sites of the abdominal area, worn for 7 consecutive days, and then replaced according to an established rotation schedule, until 5 weeks of treatment were completed. the rotation schedule was adopted to provide an assessment of skin reaction as related to (1) interval between two consecutive placements at the same application site; (2) number of repetitions; and (3) abdominal region (upper, middle, and lower). A skin reaction score was obtained at each site before the application of each patch, 80 minutes after patch removal, and 7 days after patch removal. Skin swabs were obtained for bacteriologic cultures immediately before patch application and immediately after patch removal. Twenty-seven women were enrolled and completed the study; 270 skin observations were made with the <b>estradiol</b> <b>patch</b> and 162 with placebo. Skin reactions 30 minutes after patch removal included erythema (23. 7 %), erythema with induration (4. 1 %), and erythema with induration and vesicles (1. 1 %). Seven days after patch removal, skin reactions had decreased to erythema (2. 2 %) and erythema with induration (0. 4 %); no erythema with induration and vesicles was seen. This reduction in {{incidence and}} severity was statistically significant. Thirty minutes after placebo removal, 2. 5 % of skin observations detected erythema; no erythema was observed 7 days later. No other severe reactions were observed, and no clinically significant alteration in skin flora was detected. {{the results of this study}} indicate an acceptable level of local skin responses to this 7 -day <b>estradiol</b> <b>patch</b> application. in addition, 96. 3 % of patients rated the <b>estradiol</b> <b>patch</b> as good or very good in its acceptability.

40|$|Context: Estradiol {{inhibits}} gonadotropin {{release in}} men by an {{action at the}} hypothalamus and pituitary. Because of the tissue-specific regulation of aromatase, peripheral estradiol levels may not reflect brain estradiol concentrations. Objective: We evaluated whether local aromatization of testosterone in the hypothalamus or pituitary is important for gonadotropin release {{and to what extent}} circulating estrogens affect gonadotropin levels and peripheral testosterone levels. Design, Subjects, and Interventions: We suppressed aromatase activity in 10 young healthy men with letrozole 2. 5 mg once daily, restored plasma estradiol levels with estradiol patches (100 μg/d for the first week, 50 μg/d the second week, 25 μg/d the third week, and no <b>estradiol</b> <b>patch</b> the fourth week) and measured plasma testosterone, estradiol, LH, FSH, and SHBG levels. Results: The mean estradiol and testosterone levels during the study ranged between 68. 6 μ 38. 3 and 12. 6 μ 7. 21 pg/ml for estradiol and 179 μ 91 and 955 μ 292 ng/dl (mean μ SD) for testosterone. Levels of testosterone, LH, and FSH were inversely related to peripheral estradiol levels. During letrozole use, the mean plasma estradiol level needed to restore testosterone, LH, and FSH levels to baseline levels was not significantly different from the baseline mean estradiol level. Conclusions: Local aromatization of testosterone in the hypothalamo-pituitary compartment is not a prerequisite for expression of the inhibitory action of estrogens on gonadotropin secretion in men. Peripheral estradiol levels directly reflect the inhibitory tone exerted by estrogens on gonadotropin release and are a major determinant of peripheral testosterone, LH, and FSH levels.

40|$|METHODS: Two {{randomized}} prospective multicentre parallel group {{studies were}} performed (one in Germany {{and the other}} in Italy) in symptomatic postmenopausal women. The goal was to assess the efficacy on climacteric symptoms and the safety of a new estradiol (CAS 50 - 28 - 2) transdermal patch with solid active matrix (SAM) in comparison to a conventional liquid reservoir (LR) type <b>estradiol</b> transdermal <b>patch.</b> Both patches released 50 micrograms/day estradiol. One group of patients received the SAM patch and the other the LR patch in 4 -week cycles, with a twice-weekly application of the patches for 3 weeks, followed by one week without patches. Progestin opposition was achieved with medroxyprogesterone acetate 5 mg/day orally in the last 11 days of patch application in the German study and with 10 mg/day in the last 12 days of patch application in the Italian study. Both studies were divided into two Parts: Part 1 with three 4 -week cycles for a total of 12 weeks and Part 2 for other ten 4 -weeks cycles in which the patches could be applied also continuously. The total duration of the study was therefore 52 weeks. RESULTS: Germany study. 133 patients resulted randomized to the SAM group and 129 to the LR group. Both <b>estradiol</b> <b>patches</b> quickly relieved climacteric symptoms already during the first 3 weeks of patch application, as shown by the rapid decrease of the Kupperman Index.

40|$|The {{effects of}} 6 months of hormone {{replacement}} therapy by transdermal <b>estradiol</b> <b>patches</b> (0. 05 mg/day for 21 days) and oral progestogens (10 mg/day for 10 days) on hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian function was evaluated in 32 perimenopausal women, aged 42 - 47 years, with irregular anovulatory cycles and menopausal symptoms. Hormone levels evaluated on the 8 th and 24 th day of the cycle preceding therapy showed follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels above 15 mIU/ml, estradiol less than 45 pg/ml and progesterone less than 800 pg/ml. During therapy, there was an improvement in menopausal symptoms, a decrease in luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH levels, an increase in estradiol levels and the transdermal patches were well tolerated. At the end of therapy, 19 women continued to have regular ovulatory cycles with progesterone levels {{similar to those in}} luteal phase. FSH and LH concentrations were significantly lower than before therapy. This study shows that {{hormone replacement therapy}} not only improves menopausal symptoms but may also restore the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian function...|$|R
50|$|Although {{infrequently}} used {{in modern}} times and although synthetic estrogens like diethylstilbestrol and ethinylestradiol have been more commonly used, estradiol {{is used in the}} treatment of prostate cancer and is similarly effective to other therapies such as androgen deprivation therapy with castration and antiandrogens. It is used {{in the form of the}} long-lasting injected estradiol prodrugs polyestradiol phosphate and estradiol undecylate, and has also more recently been assessed in the form of transdermal <b>estradiol</b> <b>patches.</b> Estrogens are effective in the treatment of prostate cancer by suppressing testosterone levels into the castrate range, increasing levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and thereby decreasing the fraction of free testosterone, and possibly also via direct cytotoxic effects on prostate cancer cells. Parenteral estradiol is largely free of the cardiovascular side effects of the high oral dosages of synthetic estrogens that were used previously. In addition, estrogens may have advantages relative to castration in terms of hot flashes, sexual interest and function, osteoporosis, and cognitive function and may offer significant benefits in terms of quality of life. However, side effects such as gynecomastia and feminization in general may be difficult to tolerate or unacceptable for many men.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of pubertal induction {{in children with}} hypogonadism is to mimic spontaneous puberty in terms of physical and psychological development. In a clinical observation study, we induced puberty in 15 girls with hyper- or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism using low doses of transdermal <b>estradiol</b> <b>patches</b> attached only during the night and compared the estradiol concentrations obtained with those in healthy girls. Pubertal induction was started {{between the ages of}} 12. 3 and 18. 1 yr. A transdermal matrix patch of 17 beta -estradiol (25 mug/ 24 h; Evorel, Janssen Pharmaceuticals-Cilag) was cut into pieces corresponding to 3. 1, 4. 2, or 6. 2 mug/ 24 h initially and attached to the buttock. After 4 - 14 months, the dose was increased gradually. Serum 17 beta -estradiol concentrations were measured every 2 h by RIA (detection limit, 6. 0 pmol/L; 1. 6 pg/mL). The results show {{that it is possible to}} mimic the spontaneous levels as well as the diurnal pattern of serum 17 beta -estradiol in early puberty, by cutting a transdermal 17 beta -estradiol matrix patch and attaching a part of it, corresponding to 0. 08 - 0. 12 pg estradiol/kg BW, to the buttock nocturnally.

40|$|Purpose: Current {{hormonal}} therapies {{for prostate}} cancer are associated with significant morbidities, including symptoms of andropause and osteoporosis. Oral estrogens prevented many of these problems but were abandoned due to cardiovascular toxicity attributed to hepatic effect. In contrast, parenteral estrogens prevent first pass hepatic metabolism and substantially reduce cardiovascular risk, and long-term transdermal estradiol therapy {{is believed to be}} cardioprotective. We report preliminary results of a pilot study using transdermal estradiol therapy to treat men with advanced prostate cancer. Materials and Methods: A total of 20 patients with advanced prostate cancer were enrolled in a before and after study that examined the impact of <b>estradiol</b> <b>patches</b> on hormones, disease, thrombophilia, vascular flow, osteoporosis and quality of life. Results: Median followup is 15 months. Estradiol levels greater than 1, 000 pmol. /l. were achieved using 2 patches and higher levels were obtained by increasing the number of patches. All patients achieved castrate levels of testosterone within 3 weeks and had biochemical evidence of disease regression. One patient died of disease at 14 months and 1 cardiovascular complication occurred. Thrombophilic activation was avoided and vascular flow improved. Bone mineral density was significantly increased. Mild or moderate gynecomastia occurred in 80 % of patients but no patient had hot flushes. All other functional and symptomatic quality of life domains improved. Conclusions: Transdermal estradiol therapy produced an effective tumor response. Cardiovascular toxicity was substantially reduced compared with that expected of oral estrogen, and other morbidity (gynecomastia) was negligible. Transdermal estradiol therapy prevented andropause symptoms, improved quality of life scores and increased bone density. Transdermal estradiol costs a tenth of current therapy cost, with the potential for considerable economic savings over conventional hormone therapies...|$|R
40|$|Context. In aging men, {{circulating}} testosterone (T) declines {{which is}} associated {{with an increase in}} the levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), albeit insufficient to maintain T at its original level. It has been speculated that a higher sensitivity of the hypothalamus and/or pituitary for the feedback effect of circulating sex hormones in older men is responsible. Objective. To compare the effect of experimentally varied plasma levels of estradiol on the LH and FSH secretion in young and old castrated male-to-female transsexuals, in almost absence of T. Design, subjects, and interventions. In 10 healthy, young (mean age 37. 6 ± 6. 2 years) and 11 healthy, old (mean age 68. 1 ± 7. 0) male-to-female transsexuals after gonadectomy plasma estradiol levels were experimentally varied with <b>estradiol</b> <b>patches</b> (the first week 100 μg/day patches, the second week 50 μg/day, the third week 25 μg/day and the fourth week no patch was applied) and plasma levels of LH and FSH were monitored after every week. Results. Mean plasma bioavailable estradiol (E 2) levels in the two groups ranged between 13. 6 and 104 pmol/l. LH and FSH were inversely related to peripheral estradiol levels, were lower in the old group at all time points reaching statistical significance in the last week of the study when no patch was applied and estradiol levels were extremely low. Conclusions. The results of this study do not support the hypothesis of an age related increasing sensitivity of the hypothalamo-pituitary compartment for the negative feedback of E 2, but suggest a deficient feed-forward drive in older male-to-female transsexuals. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Oral estrogens were an {{effective}} treatment {{for prostate cancer}} but were abandoned because of {{an increased risk of}} cardiovascular toxicity and particularly thromboembolism. We have recently shown that transdermal estradiol produces {{an effective}} tumor response and negligible cardiovascular toxicity. Here we report the influence of transdermal estradiol therapy on the coagulation profile of men with advanced prostate cancer. Materials and Methods A total of 20 patients with newly diagnosed locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer were treated using transdermal <b>estradiol</b> <b>patches</b> and the coagulation profile was assessed before and during 12 months therapy. Activation of coagulation was assessed by assaying the levels of activated factor VII (VIIa), activated factor XII (XIIa), prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 (F 1 + 2), thrombin-antithrombin III (TAT III) complex and fibrinogen. Inhibition of the coagulation cascade was assayed by protein C, protein S and activated protein C resistance (APC-R). Fibrinolytic activity was determined by assaying tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) and plasminogen activation inhibitor type 1 (PAI- 1). D-Dimer levels assessed both coagulation and fibrinolytic (thrombophilic) activity. Venous Duplex, color Doppler ultrasound and photoplethysmography were used to assess for thrombosis. Results Levels of VIIa and XIIa were unaffected by transdermal estradiol therapy. Although levels of TAT III were increased in some patients at 12 months, the increase was markedly less than that observed historically with equivalent doses of oral estrogens. Levels of the inhibitory and fibrinolytic factors including protein C, protein S, APC-R, TPA and PAI- 1 remained stable. Reductions in F 1 +F 2, fibrinogen and D-Dimer levels represented a normalization from increased levels to the physiological range. Conclusions These results suggest that transdermal estradiol reduces thrombophilic activation in men with advanced prostate cancer, and protects against the risk of thrombosis...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT : Kisspeptin and neurokinin B (NKB) are obligate {{for normal}} gonadotropin secretion, but their {{hierarchy}} is unexplored in normal women. Objective: To investigate {{the interaction between}} kisspeptin and NKB on estrogen-regulated LH secretion. DESIGN : Women were treated with neurokinin- 3 receptor (NK 3 R) antagonist followed by transdermal estradiol to induce LH secretion 48 hours later, with kisspeptin- 10 or vehicle infusion during estrogen administration in a 2 -way crossover study. SETTING : Clinical research facility. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS : Healthy females with regular menses. INTERVENTION (S) : NK 3 R antagonist AZD 4901 40 mg twice daily orally was taken from cycle day 4 – 6 for 6 days (n 10, with 10 no treatment controls). Transdermal <b>estradiol</b> <b>patches</b> (200 g/d) were applied after 5 days of NK 3 R antagonist treatment. At 24 -hour estradiol treatment, women were randomized to 7 -hour kisspeptin- 10 (4 g/kg/h) or vehicle iv infusion, with the alternate infusion in a subsequent cycle. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Plasma gonadotropin and estradiol secretion. RESULTS : After an initial suppression, LH secretion was increased 48 hours after estradiol treatment. Kisspeptin- 10 increased LH secretion during the inhibitory phase, and LH remained elevated beyond the discontinuation of kisspeptin- 10 infusion. NK 3 R antagonist decreased LH pulse frequency (0. 5 0. 2 vs 0. 7 0. 2 pulses/h, P. 05) and stimulated FSH response to kisspeptin- 10 infusion (10. 7 11. 0 vs 5. 0 3. 6 IU/L, P. 05) with a nonsignificant rise in LH. The duration of LH response was blunted, with LH being lower at 48 hours (7. 5 4. 8 vs 15. 0 11. 4 IU/L, P. 05). CONCLUSIONS : These data demonstrate that NKB signaling regulates GnRH/LH secretion in normal women,and is predominantly proximal to kisspeptin in mediating estrogenic positive and negative feedback on LH secretion.

40|$|Severe dieting and {{negative}} energy balance usually {{lead to the}} occurrence of amenorrhea together with several endocrine disturbances such as the low T 3 syndrome and an abnormal GH secretion. To evaluate whether estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) affects thyroid hormones and GH secretion, two groups of patients affected by weight-loss-related amenorrhea and with low plasma T 3 levels were treated with two different schedules of ERT using 50 or 100 mu g <b>estradiol</b> transdermal <b>patches</b> twice a week (Dermestril, Rottapharm, Monza, Italy). Before and after 5 weeks of therapy in each patient thyroid hormones, spontaneous GH secretion and GH-RH-induced GH release were evaluated.

Conversely the low T 3 plasma levels and GH-RH-induced GH response were not modified by ERT. Our present data suggest that in amenorrhea related to weight-loss, hormonal abnormalities are only in part dependent from the hypoestrogenic condition. (J. Endocrinol.

40|$|Various ovarian {{substances}} {{regulate the}} secretion of gonadotrophins during the menstrual cycle, {{but there are}} still several unclarified issues. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the positive feedback effect of progesterone during the immediate period following ovariectomy. Experiments were performed in 12 normally cycling women (aged 39 - 49 years). Following abdominal hysterectomy plus bilateral ovariectomy performed on cycle day 3 (day 0), the women received either <b>estradiol</b> via skin <b>patches</b> (days 0 - 7, n = 6, group 1) or estradiol as above plus vaginal progesterone (days 1 - 7, n = 6, group 2). Serum estradiol values increased similarly in the two groups. After the operation, serum progesterone levels decreased significantly in group 1, while in group 2 they remained stable becoming higher than in group 1 (p < 0. 05). An LH and an FSH surge occurred in group 2 with the values after the peak returning to the pre-surge baseline. In contrast, in group 1 LH and FSH levels following an initial decrease, increased gradually until the end of the experiment. These results demonstrate that, despite a variable response to estrogens, the positive feedback effect of progesterone remained intact immediately after ovariectomy in women. It is suggested that it is the combining action of estradiol and progesterone that can ensure the expression of a positive feedback mechanism in women...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{is known}} that during the {{follicular}} phase of the cycle, estradiol sensitizes the pituitary to GnRH. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the role of ovarian steroids in the control of GnRH-induced gonadotrophin secretion in the luteal phase of the cycle. METHODS: Eighteen normally cycling women were studied during the week following bilateral ovariectomy plus hysterectomy performed in early to mid-luteal phase. Six of the women received no hormonal treatment post-operatively (group 1, control), six received <b>estradiol</b> through skin <b>patches</b> (group 2) and the remaining six received estradiol plus progesterone (group 3). In all women the response at 30 min of LH (DeltaLH) and FSH (DeltaFSH) to GnRH (10 mug i. v.) was investigated on a daily basis. RESULTS: In group 1, serum FSH, LH and DeltaFSH values increased progressively following ovariectomy, while in groups 2 and 3 this increase was postponed or abolished. In contrast to DeltaFSH, DeltaLH values showed the same pattern of changes in all three groups with a significant decline up to post-operative day 4 and a gradual increase thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate, for the first time, that in the early to mid-luteal phase of the cycle, estradiol and progesterone participate in the control of GnRH-induced FSH, but not LH, secretion. It is possible that in the luteal phase, the response of LH to GnRH is partly regulated by gonadotrophin surge attenuating factor...|$|R
40|$|People {{with type}} 2 {{diabetes}} have a substantially increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Short-term studies with unopposed oral estradiol in women with diabetes have suggested potentially beneficial effects on lipids, thrombotic factors, and insulin sensitivity. However, most (nonhysterectomized) postmenopausal women require combined estrogen-progesterone preparations. We randomized 43 women with {{type 2 diabetes}} either to continuous transdermal <b>estradiol</b> (80 -mug <b>patches)</b> in combination with oral norethisterone (1 mg daily) or to identical placebos. Blood samples were taken before and after 6 months for measurement of lipoproteins, coagulation factors, and endothelial markers. Total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations decreased by 8 % and 22 %, respectively, in those receiving hormone replacement therapy (P lt 0. 05 relative to change in placebo group after adjustment for baseline concentrations). There was a trend toward a reduction in high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration (P = 0. 06). Factor VII activity decreased by 16 % (P lt 0. 001), and von Willebrand factor antigen decreased by 7 % (P = 0. 014) with active treatment. Levels of fibrinogen, tissue plasminogen activator, fibrin D dimer, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, lipoprotein(a), and leptin were not significantly altered. No change in glycemic control was detected. Overall, lipid changes may be considered slightly beneficial with respect to CHD risk. The significant decrease in factor VII activity {{in this study is}} notable, because elevated factor VII activity has been associated with an increased risk of coronary thrombosis and normally increases with administration of oral estrogen- containing preparations. In addition, a reduction in von Willebrand factor antigen is consistent with an improvement in endothelial function. We suggest that the regimen used in this study may have the potential to reduce CHD risk in women with type 2 diabetes...|$|R
40|$|El sinciciotrofoblasto (SCT) de {{placenta}} humana regula la transferencia de solutos y agua entre la sangre fetal y materna. En el presente trabajo observamos que el canal de sodio ENaC (asociado a cuadros como el síndrome de Liddle y pseudohipoaldosteronismo) está presente en la membrana apical del SCT y que la subunidad a del canal tiene una expresión reducida en placentas con hipertensión gestacional (preeclampsia). Realizamos estudios a nivel de expresión de ARN (RT-PCR) y a nivel proteico (western blot e inmunohistoquímica). En la línea celular BeWo (modelo de SCT humano) el canal se encuentra presente y la expresión del mismo es regulada por las hormonas aldosterona, vasopresina, estradiol y progesterona. Analizamos la actividad del ENaC por electrofisiología y observamos corrientes sensibles a amiloride (10 µM) cuando las células BeWo se cultivaron 12 horas con aldosterona (100 nM). Esta corriente presentó una magnitud 20 veces mayor que las corrientes basales, un potencial de reversión cercano a 3 mV y una conductancia de 127 ± 26 pS/pF entre los pulsos de - 60 y - 140 mV aplicados. Las características de esta corriente son similares a las producidas por ENaC en otros tejidos y evidencian la presencia de un canal funcional. El papel del ENaC en el SCT es poco comprendido, aunque la diferencia de expresión en la preeclampsia podría tener consecuencias para el transporte placentario de agua y iones. Nuestros datos son {{un aporte}} para futuros estudios de los mecanismos involucrados en la patofisiología de la preeclampsia. The syncytiotrophoblast (SCT), a multinucleated epithelium forming the outer layer of chorionic villi, acts in human placenta as a transporting barrier regulating the transference of nutrients, solutes and water between maternal and fetal blood. Electrolyte homeostasis and extracellular fluid volume are maintained primarily by regulated Na+ transport. The {{present study was}} conducted to analyze the presence of the epithelial Na channel (ENaC) in placental tissue from normal and pre-eclamptic women and in BeWo cell, a model of a human SCT. Changes in the expression of these proteins during sodium transport across the placenta {{may be related to the}} pathogeny of pre-eclampsia. The role that ENaC and Na+ transport deregulation play on human placental tissues still remains unknown although in aldosterone-responsive epithelial cells (kidney, colon), abnormalities upregulating its activity lead to increased Na+ uptake and hypertension (i. e. Liddle´s syndrome) whereas a diminished channel activity can result in the pseudohypoaldosteronisn syndrome with salt loss and hypotension. Our results show that ENaC is expressed in the apical membrane of normal syncytiotrophoblast. The amplified fragment of a-ENaC was cloned and sequenced having a 100 % identity with the sequence of a-ENaC obtained from GenBankTM (SCNN 1 A, accession number Z 92981). We found that the transcription of the a-ENaC mRNA was not detectable in preeclamptic placentas and the protein was not observed with immunohistochemistry staining, probably indicating a low protein expression level. In BeWo cells ENac was found and its expression is regulated by aldosterone, vasopressin, progesterone and <b>estradiol.</b> With <b>patch</b> clamp techniques we studied the currents trough ENaC channels in Bewo cells. We observed currents that were blocked by 10 µM amiloride in cells incubated in 100 nM aldosterone for 12 hs. The amplitude of this current was 20 -fold the basal current, a reversal potential of 3 mV and a conductance of 127 ± 26 pS/pF with pulses between - 60 and - 140 mV. These characteristics are similar to those reported in ENaC channels in several tissues. Although their roles in placenta are still poorly understood, the differences in the expression of ENaC in pre-eclamptic placentas may have consequences for ion transport and these data could lead to future studies concerning the mechanism involved in the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia...|$|R
