25|$|I {{want to say}} at {{once that}} I frankly believe that Irving Berlin is the {{greatest}} songwriter that has ever lived.... His songs are exquisite cameos of perfection, and {{each one of them}} is as beautiful as its neighbor. Irving Berlin remains, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>America's</b> Schubert. But apart from his genuine talent for song-writing, Irving Berlin has had a greater influence upon American music than any other one man. It was Irving Berlin who was the very first to have created a real, inherent American music.... Irving Berlin was the first to free the American song from the nauseating sentimentality which had previously characterized it, and by introducing and perfecting ragtime he had actually given us the first germ of an American musical idiom; he had sown the first seeds of an American music.|$|R
5000|$|Bidle later said: [...] "We are polar opposites when {{it comes}} to our politics, {{religious}} beliefs. But that's what I loved about the whole trip. It was two people able to agree to disagree and still move on and have a great time. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's what <b>America's</b> all about." ...|$|R
5000|$|She {{became one}} of the top four finalists, and on August 14, {{performed}} [...] "What Hurts the Most" [...] (Rascal Flatts) by Jeffrey Steele and Steve Robson, as the judges' pick for her, and [...] "Over The Rainbow" [...] by Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg, as her choice. After the song, judge Piers Morgan said:.Julienne, <b>I</b> still don't <b>think</b> you've done enough to win, but I've gotta say, that was a brilliant performance. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> if <b>America</b> gives votes for people that make me look stupid, you're going to get lots of votes.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the final}} round, judge Lara Spencer asked Kaeppeler if beauty queens should declare their {{political}} viewpoint. Kaeppeler then answered, [...] "Miss America represents everyone, so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{the message to}} political candidates is that they represent everyone as well. And so in these economic times, {{we need to be}} looking forward to what <b>America</b> needs, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Miss <b>America</b> needs to represent all." [...] Kaeppeler beat out first runner-up Miss Oklahoma 2011, Betty Thompson, for the title of Miss America 2012 and was crowned by Miss America 2011, Teresa Scanlan. Along with the title of Miss America, she also won a $50,000 scholarship.|$|R
60|$|You seem {{to think}} that the Jews take no hand in {{politics}} here, that they are 'absolutely non-participants.'

5000|$|... "I've {{never done}} an {{interview}} like this, but time heals all wounds," [...] Collins told the Boston Herald. [...] "They said Steven (Tyler) wasn't going {{to participate and}} had squelched a lot of people. <b>I</b> just <b>think</b> they're <b>America's</b> greatest rock band, and I wanted {{to set the record}} straight. I was only supposed to do 30 minutes, but I let them keep me on tape for 4.5 hours." [...] Collins mentioned that his participation in the rock doc prompted Aerosmith guitarists Joe Perry and Brad Whitford to talk after seeing a raw cut of Collins' footage.|$|R
2500|$|On the {{question}} of whether the U.S. Embassy in Israel in Tel Aviv should be moved to Jerusalem, Romney said in October 2011, [...] "The actions that I will take will be actions recommended and supported by Israeli leaders. I don’t seek to take actions independent of what our allies think is best, and if Israel’s leaders thought that a move of that nature would be helpful to their efforts, then that’s something I’ll be inclined to do.... <b>I</b> don’t <b>think</b> <b>America</b> should play the role of the leader of the peace process, instead we should stand by our ally." [...] During a trip to Israel in July 2012, he reiterated that if elected president he would seek to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which he called the capital of Israel (and which he has said the U.S. should formally recognize as the capital of Israel, although Palestinians and other Arabs also claim Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state), if the government of Israel desired such a move.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{his final}} {{projects}} was writing a three-hour-long adaptation of André Malraux's 1933 novel Man's Fate, about {{the early days of}} the Chinese Revolution. The story was to have focused on several Europeans living in Shanghai during the tragic turmoil that characterized the onset of China's Communist regime. [...] "The screenplay, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> is the best one I've ever done," [...] Cimino once said, adding that he had [...] "half the money; we're trying to raise the other half." [...] The roughly $25 million project was to be filmed wholly on location in Shanghai and would have benefited from the support of China's government, which said it would provide some $2 million worth of local labor costs. Cimino had been scouting locations in China since 2001. [...] "There was never a better time to try to do Man's Fate", Cimino said, [...] "because Man's Fate is what it's all about right now. It's about the nature of love, of friendship, the nature of honor and dignity. How fragile and important all of those things are in a time of crisis." [...] Martha De Laurentiis, who with her husband Dino helped produce Year of the Dragon and Desperate Hours with Cimino, read his script for Man's Fate and passed on it. [...] "If you edit it down, it could be a very tight, beautiful, sensational movie," [...] she said, [...] "but violent, and ultimately a subject matter that <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>America</b> is that interested in." ...|$|R
2500|$|Immediately {{following}} the incident, Timberlake sounded unapologetic for his actions, telling Access Hollywood, [...] "Hey man, we love giving you all {{something to talk}} about." [...] Timberlake released a statement saying [...] "I am sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl. It was not intentional and is regrettable." [...] However, Timberlake was not required to film a video apology as Jackson was. Timberlake also addressed the incident at the Grammy Awards the following week, which Jackson was banned from attending after being scheduled as a presenter, saying [...] "I know it's been a rough week on everybody. What occurred was unintentional, completely regrettable and I apologize if you guys are offended." [...] Timberlake gave an additional interview at the Grammy event and stated, [...] "All I could say was, 'Oh, my God. Oh, my God,'" [...] Timberlake said. [...] "I looked at her. They brought a towel up on stage. They covered her up. I was completely embarrassed and just walked off the stage as quickly as I could. I'm frustrated at the whole situation. I'm frustrated that my character is being questioned. And {{the fact of the}} matter is, you know, I've had a good year, a really good year, especially with my music." [...] Timberlake later declared, [...] "It was something that went wrong. Then I felt like, I'm going to show everyone that this was something that didn't affect me, and I'm going to show up at the Grammys." [...] He later said he was unable to attend most of the halftime rehearsals due to being on tour in Spain, having only one day to rehearse. While promoting his sophomore album FutureSex/LoveSounds over two years later, Timberlake expressed regret for his behavior, saying, [...] "In my honest opinion now ... I could've handled it better. ... I'm part of a community that consider themselves artists. And if there was something I could have done in her defense that was more than I realized then, I would have. But the other half of me was like, 'Wow. We still haven't found the weapons of mass destruction and everybody cares about this!'" [...] He added, [...] "I probably got 10 percent of the blame, and that says something about society ... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>America's</b> harsher on women. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>America</b> is, you know, unfairly harsh on ethnic people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I am {{very sorry}} indeed," [...] Captain Ackinson declared, [...] "that {{you should have}} had the temerity to stop my ship, and detain me here on such a fool's errand. We are {{on the high seas}} and under the English flag. The {{document}} you have just shown me impeaching the Duc de Souspennier for 'lèse majestie' and high treason, {{and all the rest of}} it, is not worth the paper it is written on here, nor, <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> in <b>America.</b> <b>I</b> must ask you to leave my ship at once, gentlemen, and I can promise you that my employers, the Cunard ss. Company, will bring a claim against your Government for this unwarrantable detention." ...|$|R
6000|$|He assented with earnestness. He believed, he said, {{that the}} amount spent in liquors of various kinds, which do no good, but much injury, was enough to furnish every laborer's dwelling, not only with comforts, but with elegances. [...] "But then," [...] he said, [...] "one thing is to be considered: a reform of the {{dwellings}} will do a great deal towards promoting a temperance reformation. A man {{who lives in a}} close, unwholesome dwelling, deprived of the natural stimulus of fresh air and pure water, comes into a morbid and unhealthy state; he craves stimulants to support the sinking of his vital powers, caused by these unhealthy influences." [...] There is certainly a great deal of truth in this; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that, in <b>America,</b> we should add to the force of our Maine law by adopting some of the restrictions of the Lodging House act.|$|R
