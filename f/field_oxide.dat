5000|$|In 1967 John C. Sarace and {{collaborators}} at Bell Labs {{replaced the}} aluminum gate with an electrode made of vacuum-evaporated amorphous silicon and succeeded in building working self-aligned gate MOS transistors. However, the process, as described, {{was only a}} proof of principle, suitable only for the fabrication of discrete transistors and not for integrated circuits; and was not pursued any further by its investigators. [...] In 1968 the MOS industry was prevalently using aluminum gate transistors with high-threshold voltage and desired to have a low threshold voltage MOS process {{in order to increase}} the speed and reduce the power dissipation of MOS integrated circuits. Low threshold voltage transistors with aluminum gate demanded the use of 100 silicon orientation, which however produced too low a threshold voltage for the parasitic MOS transistors (the MOS transistors created when aluminum over the <b>field</b> <b>oxide</b> would bridge two junctions). To increase the parasitic threshold voltage beyond the supply voltage, it was necessary to increase the N-type doping level in selected regions under the <b>field</b> <b>oxide,</b> and this was initially accomplished {{with the use of a}} so-called channel-stopper mask, and later with ion implantation.|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{dependence}} of breakdown <b>field</b> in nitrided <b>oxides</b> on nitridation conditions. Nitridation improves the breakdown <b>field</b> of the <b>oxides.</b> In an attempt to explore {{the cause of the}} improved breakdown, the breakdown field was related with electron-trap density and refractive index (which increases with nitrogen concentration in the oxide). Our results suggest that the enhanced breakdown <b>field</b> of nitrided <b>oxides</b> is mainly due to incorporation of nitrogen, which results in structural changes in the nitrided oxide...|$|R
40|$|Neutron induced oxide charge {{trapping}} and {{generation of}} interface states in MOS capacitors with pyrogenic and nitrided pyrogenic <b>field</b> <b>oxides</b> have been studied. In {{order to assess}} the damage due to neutrons alone, {{it is necessary to}} account for the damage produced by the accompanying gamma rays from neutron radiation. This is done by measuring the intensity of gamma radiation accompanying neutrons at different neutron fluences at the irradiation position. MOS capacitor structures were subjected to neutron radiation in a swimming pool type of reactor. Other samples from the same batch were then subjected to an equivalent dose of gamma radiation from a Co(60) source. The difference in the damage observed was used to characterize the damage caused by neutrons. It is observed that neutrons, though uncharged, are capable of causing ionization damage. This damage is found to be significant when the radiation is performed under biased conditions. Nitridation in different ambients is found to improve the radiation performance of pyrogenic <b>field</b> <b>oxides</b> with respect to positive charge build up as well as interface state generation. Pyrogenic oxide nitrided in N(2) O is found to be the best oxynitride as damage due to neutrons is the least. (C) 2002...|$|R
50|$|There is a {{combination}} of processes that is used to prepare semiconducting materials for ICs. One process is called thermal oxidation, which forms silicon dioxide {{on the surface of the}} silicon. This is used as a gate insulator and <b>field</b> <b>oxide.</b> Other processes are called photomasks and photolithography. This process is what creates the patterns on the circuity in the integrated circuit. Ultraviolet light is used along with a photoresist layer to create a chemical change that generates the patterns for the circuit.|$|E
50|$|This {{technology}} {{was developed to}} insulate MOS transistors {{from each other and}} limit transistor cross-talk. The main goal is to create a silicon oxide insulating structure that penetrates under the surface of the wafer, so that the Si-SiO2 interface occurs at a lower point {{than the rest of the}} silicon surface. This cannot be easily achieved by etching <b>field</b> <b>oxide.</b> Thermal oxidation of selected regions surrounding transistors is used instead. The oxygen penetrates in depth of the wafer, reacts with silicon and transforms it into silicon oxide. In this way, an immersed structure is formed. For process design and analysis purposes, the oxidation of silicon surfaces can be modeled effectively using the Deal-Grove model.|$|E
5000|$|The {{two most}} visible {{benefits}} of OPC are correcting linewidth differences seen between features in regions of different density (e.g., center vs. {{edge of an}} array, or nested vs. isolated lines), and line end shortening (e.g., gate overlap on <b>field</b> <b>oxide).</b> For the former case, this may be used together with resolution enhancement technologies such as scattering bars (sub-resolution lines placed adjacent to resolvable lines) together with linewidth adjustments. For the latter case, [...] "dog-ear" [...] (serif or hammerhead) features may be generated at the line end in the design. OPC has a cost impact on photomask fabrication whereby the mask write time {{is related to the}} complexity of the mask and data-files and similarly mask inspection for defects takes longer as the finer edge control requires a smaller spot size.|$|E

50|$|The SGT was {{the first}} process {{technology}} used to fabricate commercial MOS integrated circuits that was later widely adopted by the entire industry in the 1960s. In late 1967, Tom Klein, working at the Fairchild Semiconductor R&D Labs, and reporting to Les Vadasz, realized that the work function difference between heavily P-type doped silicon and N-type silicon was 1.1 volt lower than the work function difference between aluminum and the same N-type silicon. This meant that the threshold voltage of MOS transistors with silicon gate could be 1.1 volt lower than the threshold voltage of MOS transistors with aluminum gate fabricated on the same starting material. Therefore, one could use starting material with 111 silicon orientation and simultaneously achieve both an adequate parasitic threshold voltage and low threshold voltage transistors {{without the use of}} a channel-stopper mask or ion implantation under the <b>field</b> <b>oxide.</b> With P-type doped silicon gate it would therefore be possible not only to create self-aligned gate transistors but also a low threshold voltage process by using the same silicon orientation of the high threshold voltage process.|$|E

A phenomenological model for <b>field</b> <b>oxide</b> thinning is given. Finally, a new figure of merit is defined which assesses the combined effects of en-croachment and <b>field</b> <b>oxide</b> thinning in isolation processes for submicron integrated circuits. As device dimensions are shrunk into the 0. 25 ~m re-gime, unforseen challenges in fabrication technology are often encountered.

40|$|A rapid thermal anneal (RTA) at low {{pressure}} is proposed as an efficient method {{for the elimination}} of the surface inversion layer formed by the charges within the <b>field</b> <b>oxide</b> orby the leakage current along the <b>field</b> <b>oxide</b> surface which is easily contaminated byphotoresist, water molecules, and mobile ions. From the high-low frequency C-V measurements, it was found that a 900 ~ RTA at a pressure of 300 Torr can remove the <b>field</b> <b>oxide</b> surface contaminants sufficiently and make the distorted portion in the strong inversion region of the high frequency C-V curve return to normal. The practice of rapid thermal annealing after chemical etching and cleaning can prevent he <b>field</b> <b>oxide</b> surface from contamination caused by the subsequent high temperature process. It was also found that after a {{low pressure}} RTA the gate oxide endurance can be dramatically enhanced and is comparable to that of the conventional furnace-annealed gate oxide.
