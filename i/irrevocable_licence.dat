50|$|The {{purpose of}} a CLA {{is to ensure that}} the {{guardian}} of a project's outputs has the necessary ownership or grants of rights over all contributions to allow them to distribute under the chosen license. In some cases this will mean that the contributor will assign the copyright in all contributions to the project owner; in other cases, they will grant an <b>irrevocable</b> <b>licence</b> to allow the project maintainer to use the contribution. CLAs also have roles in raising awareness of IPR issues within a project.|$|E
5000|$|For example, if {{one were}} to type in [...] "What is the birth date of George W. Bush?", True Knowledge would reason from the facts [...] "George W. Bush is a {{president}}", [...] "George W. Bush is a human being", [...] "A president is a subclass of human being", [...] "Date of creation is a more general form for birth date", and [...] "the 6th of July is the date of creation for George W. Bush", to produce the simple answer, [...] "the 6th of July". True Knowledge differs from competitors like Freebase and DBpedia in that they offer natural language access. Unlike the others however, users who post information to True Knowledge granted the company a [...] "non-exclusive, <b>irrevocable,</b> perpetual <b>licence</b> to use such information to operate this website and for any other purposes".|$|R

50|$|Photographs can be {{contributed by}} any {{registered}} user, although {{they must be}} approved by a panel of moderators before appearing on the website. The main aim of moderation is to make the site 'classroom ready' so that inappropriate images are rejected. The activity of taking photographs for the project is known as geographing. All images are licensed by the contributors using the Creative Commons cc-by-sa 2.0 licence which permits modification and redistribution of the images under certain conditions. Contributors should be aware that they are granting everyone an <b>irrevocable</b> <b>licence</b> to use their image(s); {{it is very difficult to}} get an image removed once it appears on the website. Photo resolution is a minimum of 640 by 480 pixels, with options for higher resolutions.|$|E
50|$|Mr Henning {{lived with}} a lady from 1974 to 1981 but was not married. They had two children. They got a house in London in 1975 with a {{mortgage}} {{and it was all}} in his name. She made contributions and did work. In 1978 they agreed to buy a villa and large Devonshire garden, where she would begin a self-sufficiency project. This was bought in his name alone for £12,900, with an £11k mortgage from the building society. His application described her as his wife and said it was for their family. She worked on the property, did buildings and decorated and earned small sums for the family budget. He left in February 1981, and in December 1981 he started possession proceedings. It ended with a consent order where he said at all times he intended her to have a one half share of the house. He stopped to pay the mortgage after, and the building society proceeded for a possession order. He did not resist the claim. The building society accepted that she had an <b>irrevocable</b> <b>licence</b> to stay in the villa.|$|E
