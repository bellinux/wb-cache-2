Hours later 13 hostage takers released their hostages and peacefully surrendered while Pugoy and the other leader Ricardo Navarro held on to their hostages, two teenage girls. The convicts who surrendered were temporarily held in the Davao City Jail. The <b>final</b> <b>demand</b> of Pugoy was to see his mother, which the military reportedly agreed to. The final two hostage takers reportedly surrendered after they were promised a transfer to the National Penitentiary and were detained {{along with the rest of}} the convicts. Most of the convicts were eventually transferred to the Davao Metrodiscom. The promise of a transfer to the National Penitentiary was denied due to the hostages filing charges of kidnapping against their former captors.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of 6 August, the leading {{authorities}} of Hunedoara County came to Lupeni, accompanied by 80 troops from the 4th frontier guards regiment and some 20 gendarmes. The mining company attempted to start the power station with strike-breakers {{in order to prevent}} the mines from being flooded and those underground from being asphyxiated, but the strikers maintained a cordon around the works. (A prosecutor later reported that the men inside the power station were [...] "armed with stakes, iron bars, bludgeons and revolvers and were awaiting the authorities with aggressive poses".) The public prosecutor made a <b>final</b> <b>demand</b> that the strikers withdraw from the power station; the strikers replied with a howl of defiance. Some 40 gendarmes now present advanced, trying to intimidate the strikers. According to later testimony, the workers then threw objects toward the gendarmes, wounding those in the first line. When a striker fired a revolver, the 80 troops fired warning shots into the air. As the miners' aggressiveness was undiminished, the troops fired 78 bullets into the crowd (without orders, as established by an enquiry), some lodging in the power station's chimney. When the firing ceased, dozens of men lay on the ground; the rest, panic-stricken, fled quickly. Work at the station resumed immediately; troops and gendarmes guarded the station and all mine buildings.|$|E

This tool uses a static, input-output model to assess the impacts of changes in <b>final</b> <b>demands</b> on first industry output, then employment and energy use. The employment and energy impacts are derived by multiplying the industry outputs (derived from the changed <b>final</b> <b>demands)</b> by industry-specific energy and employment coefficients.

So far, everything is within the limits of the accountable--of the real. A raven having learned by rote the single word [...] "Nevermore," [...] and having escaped from the custody of its owner, is driven at midnight, through the violence of a storm, to seek admission at a window from which a light still gleams--the chamber-window of a student, occupied half in pouring over a volume, half in dreaming of a beloved mistress deceased. The casement being thrown open at the fluttering of the bird's wings, the bird itself perches on the most convenient seat out of the immediate reach of the student, who, amused by the incident and the oddity of the visitor's demeanor, demands of it, in jest and with out looking for a reply, its name. The Raven addressed, answers with its customary word, [...] "Nevermore"--a word which finds immediate echo in the melancholy heart of the student, who, giving utterance aloud to certain thoughts suggested by the occasion, is again startled by the fowl's repetition of [...] "Nevermore." [...] The student now guesses the state of the case, but is impelled, as I have before explained, by the human thirst for self-torture, and in part by superstition, to propound such queries to the bird as will bring him, the lover, the most of the luxury of sorrow through the anticipated answer [...] "Nevermore." [...] With the indulgence, to the extreme, of this self-torture, the narration, in what I have termed its first or obvious phase, has a natural termination, and so far there has been no overstepping of the limits of the real.|$|E

Like nearly all the other Cambridge men of my acquaintance Dana was very much my senior, and like the rest he welcomed my literary promise as cordially as if it were performance, with no suggestion of the condescension which was said to be his attitude towards many of his fellow-men. I never saw anything of this, in fact, and I suppose he may have been a blend of those patrician qualities and democratic principles which made Lowell anomalous even to himself. He is part of the anti-slavery history of his time, and he gave to the oppressed his strenuous help both as a man and a politician; his gifts and learning in the law were freely at their service. He never lost his interest in those white slaves, whose brutal bondage he remembered as bound with them in his 'Two Years Before the Mast,' and any luckless seaman with a case or cause might count upon his friendship as surely as the black slaves of the South. He was able to temper his indignation for their oppression with a humorous perception of what was droll in its agents and circumstances; and I wish I could recall all that he said once about sea-etiquette on merchant vessels, where the chief mate might no more speak to the captain at table without being addressed by him than a subject might put a question to his sovereign. He was amusing in his stories of the Pacific trade in which he said it was very noble to deal in furs from the Northwest, and very ignoble to deal in hides along the Mexican and South American coasts. Every ship's master wished naturally to be in the fur-carrying trade, and in one of Dana's instances, two vessels encounter in mid-ocean, and exchange the usual parley as to their respective ports of departure and destination.

60|$|Penmaen., September 3, 1860.—The session {{has been}} one to make all of us thoughtful, and me perhaps most of all. It is indeed much before my mind, but my head has not ceased to whirl, so that I cannot get {{a clear view of}} what Seward would call my position. Two things I know, one is that it {{produced}} the greatest pleasures and the greatest pains I have ever known in politics; the other that 1 have had to take various decisions and perform acts that could neither be satisfactory to others, nor from the doubt attaching to {{one side or the other}} of the alternative, even to myself. To have been the occasion of the blow to the House of Commons, or as I call it the “gigantic innovation,” will be a grief to me as long as I live; if by wildness and rashness I have been its cause, it will be a much greater grief. Of that I am not yet able to judge. On the whole when I think of the cabinet, I always go back to Jacob and Esau fighting in their mother’s womb; only here there have been many Jacobs and Esaus, by which I do not mean the sixteen members of the cabinet, but the many and very unhandy causes of division. Perhaps I should find it easiest in the work of confession to own my neighbour’s faults, i.e. to dwell upon those strange sins of foreign policy which have happily for the most part been nipped in the bud almost à l’unanimité (yet with what exceptions!); but avoiding that task, I will make my own confession. I cannot justify the finance of the year as a whole.... As to the amount of the <b>final</b> <b>demand</b> [for the China war], what it really demonstrates is one among the follies and dangers of our high-handed policy, our want of control over proceedings at the other end of the world. But the weak point is the fortification plan; I do not now speak of its own merits or demerits, but I speak of it in relation to the budget.... It is a vile precedent to give away money by remission, and borrow to supply the void; and in the full and chief responsibility for having established this precedent I am involved, not by the budget of February but by the consent of July to the scheme which involved the borrowing. No doubt there are palliating circumstances; and lastly the grievous difficulty of choice between mischievous [illegible] and mischievous resignation. Still I must say, it is in retrospect, as the people and parliament have a right to judge it, a bad and unworkmanlike business, and under a skilful analysis of it in the House of Commons (which there is no one opposite fit to make, except it be Northcote, who perhaps scruples it) I should wince. All these things and others more inward than these, make sore places in the mind; but on the other hand, that I may close with a gleam of sunshine like that which is now casting its shadow on my paper from Penmaenmawr after a rough morning, I am thankful in the highest degree to have had a share in resisting the alarmist mania of the day by means of the French treaty, to which, if we escape collision, I think the escape will have been mainly due; and likewise in one at least negative service to the great Italian cause, which is not Italian merely but European.|$|E

However, few detailed analysis {{has been done to}} explain the fluctuation in energy intensity during 2002 – 2005. In this paper, we use the structural decomposition analysis (SDA) to decompose energy intensity into five determining factors: Energy input coefficient, technology coefficient (Leontief inverse coefficient), <b>final</b> <b>demands</b> structure by prod-uct, <b>final</b> <b>demands</b> by category and final energy consumption coefficient. We then further decompose two coefficients, energy input coefficient and technology coefficient, into structure and real coefficient. Empirical study is carried out based on the energy-input-output tables from 1987 to 2005 in 2000 con-stant price. The results show that between 1987 and 2002, energy input structure accounts for most of the decline in energy intensity.

In this paper, we established Beijing energy-input-output tables from 1997 to 2012 in 2002 constant price. Based on the tables we use the structural decomposition analysis (SDA) to decompose energy intensity into five determining factors: Energy input coefficient, technology coefficient (Leontief inverse coefficient), <b>final</b> <b>demands</b> structure by product, <b>final</b> <b>demands</b> by category and final energy consumption coefficient. The results show that (1) During 1997 and 2012, Beijing energy intensity had continued to decline, and the energy input coefficient and <b>final</b> <b>demands</b> by category are the main factor help to decrease the energy intensity. (2) Energy input coefficient plays a vitally important role to energy intensity decrease, which {{may be due to the}} increase of the proportion of the tertiary industry. (3) The change of <b>final</b> <b>demands</b> structure by product is a driving force to make energy intensity rising except for 2002 - 2007, and technology coefficient (Leontief inverse) has impact on energy intensity increase except for 2007 - 2012.

This paper analyzed the impact of the changes in the <b>final</b> <b>demands</b> on the country's industrial structures particularly {{from the perspective of the}} international liberalization movement. The following points were clarified. Although the electrical goods and optical mechanical sectors have traditionally maintained an influential relationship with macro-economic fluctuations, the growth potential of these sectors has begun to stagnate. However, the rural sectors have experienced potential growth circumstances under industrial structural change. Additionally, among the induced effects of the <b>final</b> <b>demands,</b> the demands derived from exports have shown greater induced effects on the manufacturing sectors such as electrical instruments, optical machines, and chemical medicines. The induced effects on the primary industry sectors, such as the rural industry, have been less significant. It is remarkable that the ratio of the induced effects by export demands has been increasing in most rural industries. From this perspective, this paper clarified that, in the future, the international movement of regional economic integration, characterized by FTA (Free Trade Agreement) and EPA (Economic Partnership Agreement), will continue to have an increasing impact on rural industries in Taiwan...|$|R
