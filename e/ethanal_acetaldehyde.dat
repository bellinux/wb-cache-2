25|$|A major {{industrial}} application for copper(II) chloride is as a co-catalyst with palladium(II) chloride in the Wacker process. In this process, ethene (ethylene) {{is converted to}} <b>ethanal</b> (<b>acetaldehyde)</b> using water and air. During the reaction, PdCl2 is reduced to Pd, and the CuCl2 serves to re-oxidize this back to PdCl2. Air can then oxidize the resultant CuCl back to CuCl2, completing the cycle.|$|E
40|$|Single-photon {{multiple}} ionization processes of <b>acetaldehyde</b> (<b>ethanal)</b> have been experimentally investigated by utilizing a multi-particle coincidence technique {{based on the}} time-of-flight magnetic bottle principle, in combination with either a synchrotron radiation source or a pulsed helium discharge lamp. The processes investigated include double and triple ionization in the valence region as well as single and double Auger decay of core-ionized acetaldehyde. The latter are studied site-selectively for chemically different carbon core vacancies, scrutinizing early theoretical predictions specifically made for the case of acetaldehyde. Moreover, Auger processes in shake-up and core-valence ionized states are investigated. In the cases where the processes involve simultaneous emission of two electrons, the distributions of the energy sharing are presented, emphasizing either the knock-out or shake-off mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Current {{atmospheric}} models {{underestimate the}} production of organic acids in the troposphere. We report a detailed kinetic model of the photochemistry of <b>acetaldehyde</b> (<b>ethanal)</b> under tropospheric conditions. The rate constants are benchmarked to collision-free experiments, where extensive photo-isomerization is observed upon irradiation with actinic ultraviolet radiation (310 to 330 nanometers). The model quantitatively reproduces the experiments and shows unequivocally that keto-enol photo-tautomerization, forming vinyl alcohol (ethenol), is the crucial first step. When collisions at atmospheric pressure are included, the model quantitatively reproduces previously reported quantum yields for photodissociation at all pressures and wavelengths. The model also predicts that 21 ± 4 % of the initially excited acetaldehyde forms stable vinyl alcohol, a known precursor to organic acid formation, which may help to account for {{the production of}} organic acids in the troposphere...|$|R
40|$|Using laser flash {{photolysis}} coupled to photo-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PIMS), methyl radicals (CH 3) {{have been detected}} as primary products from the reaction of OH radicals with <b>acetaldehyde</b> (<b>ethanal,</b> CH 3 CHO) with a yield of ~ 15 % at 1 - 2 Torr of helium bath gas. Supporting measurements based on laser induced fluorescence studies of OH recycling in the OH/CH 3 CHO/O 2 system {{are consistent with the}} PIMS study. Master equation calculations suggest that the origin of the methyl radicals is from prompt dissociation of chemically activated acetyl products and hence is consistent with previous studies which have shown that abstraction, rather than addition/elimination, is the sole route for the OH + acetaldehyde reaction. However, the observation of a significant methyl product yield suggests that energy partitioning in the reaction is different from the typical early barrier mechanism where reaction exothermicity is channeled preferentially into the newly formed bond. The master equation calculations predict atmospheric yields of methyl radicals of ~ 14 %. The implications of the observations in atmospheric and combustion chemistry are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|<b>Acetaldehyde</b> (<b>ethanal)</b> is a {{genotoxic}} carcinogen, {{which may}} occur naturally {{or as an}} added flavour in foods. We have developed an efficient method to analyze the compound {{in a wide variety}} of food matrices.

40|$|International audienceThe {{industrial}} production of poly (ethylene terephthalate), PET, {{continues to increase}} and thus {{it is important to}} understand the composition of fumes resulting from its disposal as a part of incinerated waste. In this study samples of PET material were combusted in a furnace corresponding to the German standard DIN 53 436 at the temperatures of 500 ○ C, 800 ○ C (in an air flow) and also uncontrolled burning in air. The gaseous products were then analysed using three different analytical methods: high resolution Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Carbon dioxide, methane, ethylene, acetylene, formaldehyde (methanal) and <b>acetaldehyde</b> (<b>ethanal)</b> were detected by FTIR. Water, methane, acetaldehyde, ethylene, formaldehyde, methanol, acetone, benzene, terephthalic acid, styrene (ethenylbenzene), ethanol, toluene (methylbenzene), xylene (dimethylbenzene), ethylbenzene, naphthalene, biphenyl and phenol concentrations were all quantified by both SIFT-MS and GC-MS. Additionally, the fumes resulting from uncontrolled combustion in air were analysed by FTIR which resolves the rotation-vibration structure of the absorption bands of formaldehyde (2779. 90 and 2778. 48 cm - 1) and propane, which was identified from characteristic vibrations of CH 3 groups at 2977. 00 and 2962. 00 cm - 1.

40|$|Abstract: The {{atmospheric}} environment {{inside and}} outside historical organs in several European regions is reported. In each region, comparisons were made between an instrument suffering organ pipe corrosion and an organ without corrosion problems. Concentrations of acetic acid (ethanoic acid), formic acid (methanoic acid), <b>acetaldehyde</b> (<b>ethanal),</b> formaldehyde (methanal) and other volatile organic compounds in the organ environment were determined using active sampling. Temperature and relative humidity were recorded. In addition, polished metal samples that mimic the material used in the historical organ pipes have been exposed in the organ wind systems for up to 22 months. High concentrations of acetic acid and formic acid vapours {{are present in the}} wind system of the corroded organs. Acetaldehyde and formaldehyde are also present in smaller amounts. The main source of acetic acid is the wood from which the wind system is built. In contrast, formic acid is generated in the chruch environment outside the wind system. The results show that the two organic acids {{play an important role in}} the atmospheric corrosion of organ pipes. It is suggested that the corrosion of lead pipes in historical organs can be effectively reduced by removing the sources of gaseous acetic acid and formic acid in the wind system and in the chruch environment...|$|R

40|$|Titanium dioxide {{nanotubes}} (TNT) have mainly {{been used}} in dye sensitized solar cells, essentially because of a higher transport rate of electrons from the adsorbed photo-excited dye to the Ti electrode onto which TNT instead of TiO 2 nanoparticles (TNP) are attached. The dimension ranges and the two main synthesis methods of TNT are briefly indicated here. Not surprisingly, the particular and regular texture of TNT was also expected to improve the photocatalytic efficacy for pollutant removal in air and water with respect to TNP. In this short review, the validity of this expectation is checked using the regrettably small number of literature comparisons between TNT and commercialized TNP referring to films of similar thickness and layers or slurries containing an equal TiO 2 mass. Although the irradiated geometrical area differed for each study, it was identical for each comparison considered here. For the removal of toluene (methylbenzene) or <b>acetaldehyde</b> (<b>ethanal)</b> in air, the average ratio of the efficacy of TNT over that of TiO 2 P 25 was about 1. 5, and {{for the removal of}} dyes in water, it was around 1. This lack of major improvement with TNT compared to TNP could partially be due to TNT texture disorders as seems to be suggested by the better average performance of anodic oxidation-prepared TNT. It could also come {{from the fact that the}} properties influencing the efficacy are more numerous, their interrelations more complex and their effects more important for pollutant removal than for dye sensitized solar cells and photoelectrocatalysis where the electron transport rate is the crucial parameter...|$|R
40|$|A {{strain of}} Pseudomonas putida {{isolated}} from activated sewage grew aerobically on the xenoestrogen precursor, nonylphenol polyethoxylate (NPEOx, where x {{is the number}} of ethoxylate units) as sole carbon source. Comparative growth yields on NPEOav 6, NPEOav 9, and NPEOav 20 (mixtures with average ethoxylate numbers as indicated) were consistent with utilization of all but two ethoxylate units, and the final accumulating metabolite was identified by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy as nonylphenol diethoxylate (NPEO 2). There was no growth on nonylphenol or polyethylene glycols, and there was no evidence for production of carboxylic acid analogs of NPEOx. Biodegradation kinetics measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) for each component in NPEOx mixtures showed that biodegradation proceeded via successive exoscission of the ethoxylate chain and not by direct scission between the second and third ethoxylate residues. The NPEOx-degrading activity was inducible by substrate, and cell extracts of NPEOav 9 -induced cells were also active on the pure alcohol ethoxylate, dodecyl octaethoxylate (AEO 8), producing sequentially, under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions, AEO 7, AEO 6, AEO 5, etc., thus demonstrating that the pathway involved removal of single ethoxylate units. HPLC analysis of 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazone derivatives revealed <b>acetaldehyde</b> (<b>ethanal)</b> as the sole aldehydic product from either NPEOav 9 or AEO 8 under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. We propose a mechanism for biotransformation which involves an oxygen-independent hydroxyl shift from the terminal to the penultimate carbon of the terminal ethoxylate unit of NPEOx and dissociation of the resulting hemiacetal to release acetaldehyde and the next-lower homolog, NPEOx− 1, which then undergoes further cycles of the same reaction until x = 2...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{multiple}} ionisation {{processes of}} free atoms and molecules upon single photon absorption are studied {{by means of}} a versatile multi-electron-ion coincidence spectroscopy method based on a magnetic bottle, primarily in combination with synchrotron radiation. The latter offered the possibility to access not only valence but also core levels, revealing processes, which promote the target systems into different charge states. One study focuses on double and triple ionisation processes of <b>acetaldehyde</b> (<b>ethanal)</b> in the valence region as well as single and double Auger decay of initial 1 s core vacancies. The latter are investigated site-selectively for the two chemically different carbon atoms of acetaldehyde, scrutinising theoretical predictions specifically made for that system. A related study concentrates on core-valence double ionisation spectra of acetaldehyde, which have been investigated in the light of a previously established empirical model, and which have been used as test cases for analysing this kind of spectra by means of quantum chemical electronic structure methods of increasing sophistication. A third study investigates site-specific fragmentation upon 1 s photoionisation of acetaldehyde using a magnetic bottle augmented with an in-line ion time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Experimental evidence is presented that bond rupture occurs with highest probability {{in the vicinity of the}} initial charge localisation and possible mechanisms are discussed. A site-specificity parameter P∆ is introduced to show that differences in fragmentation behavior between initial ionisations at chemically different carbon atoms probably persist even for identical internal energy contents in the nascent dications. In another study where both electrons and ions from Auger decay of core-excited and core-ionised states of CO 2 are detected in coincidence, it is confirmed that O 2 + is formed specifically in Auger decay from the C 1 s → π* and O 1 s → π* resonances, suggesting a decisive role of the π* orbital in the molecular rearrangement. Also, the molecular rearrangement is found to occur by bending in the resonant states, and O 2 + is produced by both single and double Auger decay. A new version of the multi-electron-ion coincidence method, where the ion time-of-flight spectrometer is mounted perpendicularly to the electron flight tube, which affects less the electron resolution and which allows for position sensitive detection of the ions, is employed in combination with tunable soft X-rays to reveal the branching ratios to final Xen+ states with 2  < n <  9 from pure 4 d- 1, 4 p- 1, 4 s- 1, 3 d- 1 and 3 p- 1 Xe+ hole states. The coincident electron spectra give information on the Auger cascade pathways. Byte av lokal vid disputation till Polhemssalen. </p...|$|R
