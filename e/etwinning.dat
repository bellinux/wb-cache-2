Therefore, teachers registered in the <b>eTwinning</b> action are enabled to form partnerships and develop collaborative, pedagogical school projects in any subject area with the sole requirements to employ ICT to develop their project and collaborate with teachers from other European countries (at least two teachers from two different European countries are needed).The primary workspace for the <b>eTwinning</b> action, is the <b>eTwinning</b> Portal (www.etwinning.net) and it is available in twenty-five languages. Teachers registered in the <b>eTwinning</b> action, also called eTwinners, find each other, communicate, share resources and collaborate through the <b>eTwinning</b> platform.

50|$|The main concept behind <b>eTwinning</b> is {{that schools}} are paired with another school {{elsewhere}} in the Europe and they collaboratively develop a project, also known as <b>eTwinning</b> project. The two schools then communicate using the Internet (for example, by e-mail or video conferencing) to collaborate, share and learn from each other. <b>eTwinning</b> encourages and develops ICT skills as the main activities inherently use information technology. Being 'twinned' with a foreign school also encourages cross-cultural exchanges of knowledge, fosters students' intercultural awareness, and improves their communication skills.|$|E

Two of the <b>eTwinning</b> program’s aims are: 1) to provide an opportunity for cultural exchange, and 2) to enhance language learning. The <b>eTwinning</b> platform helps schools in the EU to establish contact with each other to be able to collaborate on different projects. In addition, through the <b>eTwinning</b> platform, teachers can take part in online learning events, such as workshops and seminars. In 2015, 301, 944 teachers were registered on the platform and 40, 205 projects completed. These numbers motivate an overview of <b>eTwinning.</b> One of the findings of this {{literature review}} is that <b>eTwinning</b> support foreign language learning, but this finding is based on self-reported data. This finding, therefore, indicates that there is a lack of studies that test if there is a language development or not because of <b>eTwinning.</b> Furthermore, there are few <b>eTwinning</b> studies conducted in Sweden, and especially, from a student perspective which indicates a need for further investigations...|$|E

40|$|With the {{introduction}} of computers and Internet access at many schools, {{a whole new world}} of opportunities has opened up within the area of education. In 2005 the European Union eLearning programme introduced an action called <b>eTwinning,</b> which provides an opportunity for schools in the Member States of the European Union to register international partnerships and engage in ICT-based projects. The object of <b>eTwinning</b> is to promote school collaboration across the borders. The introduction of <b>eTwinning</b> provides many educational opportunities for teachers and students, but the inclusion of ICT-based projects also brings pedagogical challenges for teachers. This paper looks at how three Swedish upper secondary schools have used <b>eTwinning</b> as a teaching tool in their classroom to enhance the students’ English skills and include multicultural awareness studies as part of the curriculum, and also how they have incorporated course criteria from the national curriculum in these international projects. The analysis of the qualitative data will take into account pedagogical approaches that the teachers have used in the projects. The final discussion focuses on best practice ideas for <b>eTwinning</b> projects, based on the national course criteria in combination with pedagogical theory. One intention is with this paper is to encourage further studies on how <b>eTwinning</b> can be used as an integrated part of classroom activities based on the participating countries’ national curricula...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{educational}} use of <b>eTwinning</b> in foreign language learning, from an emic perspective. The <b>eTwinning</b> Platform {{can be described as}} a learning community for schools in Europe which promotes school collaboration through the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). This offers a real opportunity for authentic communication and intercultural collaboration. Today it is a great emphasis in gaining communicative competence and intercultural competence in foreign languages, exemplified from the curriculum of foreign languages in LK 06, The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) and other documents relevant for foreign language learning. This study’s main objective has been to explore the language learners’ reflections on potentials for foreign language learning from participating in an <b>eTwinning</b> project, in lower secondary school. The data were collected through questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and reflection logs. The data have been triangulated and analyzed thematically. Two overall themes related to authentic communication and intercultural competence were established, with reference to the main research questions defined in my study: What are the potentials for foreign language learning when participating in an <b>eTwinning</b> project in lower secondary school, as perceived and expressed by the students? I found that there was a high degree of consciousness that using the language in real and authentic communication situations with other language learners is beneficial for the language learning outcome. This study also showed that intercultural collaboration in an <b>eTwinning</b> project was considered to increase the participants’ intercultural competence. The study furthermore displayed that <b>eTwinning</b> was evaluated to be an efficient tool in foreign language learning because it embraces many parts of the subject. This makes it possible to develop many skills simultaneously and hence learn Spanish more effectively. In addition the study found that scaffolding was essential for language learning to take place.

Social learning approaches such as social constructivist theory is well established, however, the current challenges lie in creating reliable methods to gather evidence of how and under which conditions social learning takes place in such socio-technical networks {{and how does it}} support teachers’ lifelong learning goals. The field of Learning Analytics (LA) addresses the issue of individual learners, whereas Social Learning Analytics (SLA) addresses that of groups’ processes in knowledge construction. The <b>eTwinning</b> action is used as a case study for applying the concepts of Social Learning Analytics. Our interest is on teachers’ co-operation behaviour and patterns within a socio-technical network and how that can support teachers’ continuous professional development. The <b>eTwinning</b> platform currently hosts more than 160000 European teachers. We first introduce the underlying pedagogical and lifelong learning related assumptions regarding teachers’ co-operation. To better understand the type of activities that teachers undertake in <b>eTwinning,</b> they are classified according to the OECD‘s indices for teachers’ co-operation.

A class in France {{was chosen as the}} European partner for the project. However, this case study focused only on the findings from the Irish class. The study examined the ease of use of the <b>eTwinning</b> TwinSpace platform. It also examined the interaction, communication and collaboration within small groups and the motivation of the students when using computer technology. The affective and cognitive aspects of learning were examined to ascertain if participation in an <b>eTwinning</b> project can promote broad based learning among primary school students. Both quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection were used in this case study. The study involved dividing the Irish class into five groups of four members. Each group researched and collaborated on a topic related to their local area. Information gathered on their group topic was exchanged with the other groups in their class and also with their French partner class through the TwinSpace platform. This was achieved by the students using a variety of computer tools and applications. The study concluded that participation in an <b>eTwinning</b> project is extremely beneficial for primary school students, both cognitively and affectively. They were intrinsically motivated in the project and continued their learning outside of school time. However, this case study did find that younger children and/or those unfamiliar with computers may have some difficulties using the TwinSpace platform and recommends some amendments and additional functions. The formation of small groups increased collaboration and enhanced the student’s personal development and social skills.

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} how digital {{technologies}} can create opportunities for online collaboration across schools {{within the framework}} of the <b>eTwinning</b> programme, an EU initiative that seeks to promote web-based learning and collaboration between schools across Europe. A socio-technical approach was employed, focusing on the role of social context in shaping the technology use surrounding the <b>eTwinning</b> activities. This 'social shaping of technology' approach allowed exploration of the range of social actors and factors that influence the implementation of digital technologies for school collaboration at micro, meso and macro levels of analysis. Through a comparative, qualitative case study of four different <b>eTwinning</b> projects in the UK and Greece, this thesis investigates how digital technologies such as wikis, blogs and discussion forums were used as online collaborative environments. Data collection took place during the course of the academic year 2009 - 2010, consisting of semi-structured individual and group interviews alongside classroom observations and online documentary analysis. The findings suggest that students' and teachers' use of digital technologies and, in particular web 2. 0 tools, was influenced by a range of social issues relating to the wider school context. As such the tools per se did not lead to noticeable changes in practice - especially regarding collaborative activity. Specifically, all four case study projects were bounded by wider settings and factors such as time, resourcing, assessment regimes and 'fit' with curriculum. This thesis argues that amidst the enthusiasm that surrounds digital technologies in education, there is a pressing need for more critical consideration of the socially and institutionally shaped realities of use. The thesis concludes with a range of suggestions for the future improvement of such web-based collaborative initiatives. ...|$|E
