5|$|Bolt won a third {{consecutive}} world relay {{gold medal in}} the 4 × 100 metres relay final, which made him the most successful athlete in the 30-year <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> championships. The Jamaican team, featuring four of the top five from the 100m final were comfortable winners with Bolt reaching the finish line on his anchor leg three tenths of a second ahead of the American team anchored by Gatlin. Bolt's performances were matched on the women's side by Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, meaning Jamaica took a complete sweep of the sprint medals at the 2013 World Championships.|$|E
5|$|Mercator {{was welcomed}} by Duke Wilhelm who {{appointed}} him as court Cosmographer. There is no precise definition of this term {{other than that}} it certainly comprehends the disciplines of geography and astronomy {{but at that time}} it would also include astrology and chronology (as a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> from the creation). All of these were among Mercator's accomplishments but his patron's first call on his services was as a mundane surveyor of the disputed boundary between the Duke's territory of the County of Mark and the Duchy of Westphalia.|$|E
5|$|The game follows Naija, a mermaid-like woman, as she {{explores the}} {{underwater}} world of Aquaria. Along her journey, she learns {{about both the}} <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and her own past. The gameplay focuses {{on a combination of}} swimming, singing and combat, through which Naija can interact with the world. Naija's songs can move items, affect plants and animals, and change her physical appearance into other forms. These forms have different abilities, such as firing projectiles at hostile creatures or passing through barriers inaccessible to her in her natural form.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} finds and uses Tarot cards to unlock new areas and gain more {{information}} about the true <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Upon returning to the Bequest Globe between worlds, the player sees the Roman numerals in its display light up in relation to the cards that have been recovered. After recovering three of the lost artifacts, the player fails to recover the last one, the Ark of the Covenant, which {{takes the form of a}} nuclear warhead. The player is able to choose one of three endings, depending on whether they decide to enter a final doorway in the chambers of one of the two opposing factions represented by Kether and Malchut, or enter a new central chamber via the Bequest Globe.|$|E
5|$|While {{introduced}} in 2002 {{as a new}} title, the WWE often made allusions to other titles including those of WCW and the NWA, amalgamating {{the history of the}} championship with the history of the belt that represents it. As affirmed by WWE, the World Heavyweight Championship is not a continuation of the WCW Championship, but rather its successor by way of the WWE Undisputed Championship, just as the WCW Championship spun off from the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Due to its relation to both titles, its lineage is connected with the earliest recognized world heavyweight championship. In 2009, WWE released a DVD set called <b>History</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Heavyweight Championship that definitively linked the title to the WCW and NWA titles.|$|E
5|$|For Germany, {{the final}} result meant that, for the fourth {{straight}} time, they were positioned among the tournament's top 3 teams; moreover, the victory allowed the Germans {{to become the first}} side to reach eight World Cup finals. The match was a record 12th time a German team played in a semi-final. Germany became the first team to score 7 goals in a World Cup semi-final. The last time a team scored six goals was West Germany in 1954 versus Austria, same as in both semi-finals in 1930. It was Germany's highest half-time lead in a World Cup match, with their previous best being 4–0 against Saudi Arabia in 2002, the match finished 8–0 which is Germany's biggest World Cup victory. Only two teams have previously trailed by at least five goals at half-time: Zaire (versus Yugoslavia in 1974) and Haiti (versus Poland in 1974). The seven goals scored by Germany reflected a better goal-scoring record in the World Cup Finals than that of 28 other nations in their respective <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Cup.|$|E

5|$|During the World Cup in Germany, Messi {{witnessed}} {{their opening}} match {{victory against the}} Ivory Coast from the substitutes' bench. In the next match, against Serbia and Montenegro, he became the youngest player to represent Argentina at a FIFA World Cup when he came on as a substitute in the 74th minute. He assisted their fourth strike within minutes and scored the final goal in their 6–0 victory, making him the youngest scorer in the tournament and the sixth-youngest goalscorer in the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Cup. As their progression to the knockout phase was secured, several starters were rested during the last group match. Messi consequently started the game against the Netherlands, a 0–0 draw, as they won their group on goal differential. In the round of 16 match against Mexico, played on his 19th birthday, Messi came on in the 84th minute, with the score tied at 1–1. He appeared to score a goal, but it was contentiously ruled offside, with the team needing a late goal in extra time to proceed. He did not play in the quarter-final against Germany, during which Argentina were eliminated 4–2 in a penalty shootout. Back home, Pékerman's decision to leave him on the bench against Germany led to widespread criticism from those who believed Messi could have changed {{the outcome of the}} match in Argentina's favour.|$|E
5|$|The {{qualifying}} {{session was}} held on Saturday afternoon and lasted one-hour between 13:00 to 14:00 CEST, each driver was allowed up to twelve timed laps, with their fastest lap used to determine their grid position. Cars were timed using a TAG Heuer timing system, which measured to an accuracy of one-thousandth of a second. At {{the end of the}} session, the three fastest drivers had all set the same laptime, the first time this had happened in the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Championship. Jacques Villeneuve was first to set a time of 1:21.072, fourteen minutes into the one hour session. A further fourteen minutes later, Michael Schumacher posted an identical time. With nine minutes of the session remaining, Heinz-Harald Frentzen crossed the line, again with a time of 1:21.072. Under the regulations, in the event of drivers setting equal times in qualifying, the order in which the times were set is considered, with the first driver to set the time given precedence. Villeneuve was awarded pole position on the starting grid for the race, with Schumacher second and Frentzen third. Fourth place on the grid went to the reigning World Champion, Damon Hill, in his Arrows, with a time of 1:21.130, 0.058 seconds behind the time of the leading three. Hill had been on course to get pole position but had to slow {{towards the end of the}} lap because of yellow flags due to an incident involving Ukyo Katayama's Minardi.|$|E
