6000|$|I do {{not know}} the exact line of {{demarcation}} between engine-room and gunnery repairs, but I imagine it is faint and fluid. E11, for example, while she was helping E14 to shell a beached steamer, smashed half her <b>gun-mounting,</b> [...] "the gun-layer being thrown overboard, and the gun nearly following him." [...] However, the mischief was repaired in the next twenty-four hours, which, considering the very limited deck space of a submarine, means that all hands must have been moderately busy. One hopes that they had not to dive often during the job.|$|E
6000|$|At this point--it was off Rodosto--enter a small steamer {{which does}} not halt when requested, and so is fired at with [...] "several rounds" [...] from a rifle. The crew, on being told to abandon her, tumble into their boats with such haste that they capsize two out of three. [...] "Fortunately," [...] says E11, [...] "they are {{able to pick up}} everybody." [...] You can imagine to {{yourself}} the confusion alongside, the raffle of odds and ends floating out of the boats, and the general parti-coloured hurrah's-nest all over the bright broken water. What you cannot imagine is this: [...] "An American gentleman then appeared on the upper deck who informed us that his name was Silas Q. Swing, of the Chicago Sun, and that he was pleased to make our acquaintance. He then informed us that the steamer was proceeding to Chanak and he wasn't sure if there were any stores aboard." [...] If anything could astonish the Trade at this late date, one would almost fancy that the apparition of Silas Q. Swing ("very happy to meet you, gentlemen") might have started a rivet or two on E11's placid skin. But she never even quivered. She kept a lieutenant of the name of D'Oyley Hughes, an expert in demolition parties; and he went aboard the tramp and reported any quantity of stores--a six-inch gun, for instance, lashed {{across the top of the}} forehatch (Silas Q. Swing must have been an unobservant journalist), a six-inch <b>gun-mounting</b> in the forehold, pedestals for twelve-pounders thrown in as dunnage, the afterhold full of six-inch projectiles, and a scattering of other commodities. They put the demolition charge well in among the six-inch stuff, and she took it all to the bottom in a few minutes, after being touched off.|$|E

50|$|Alongside the new Basins new {{buildings}} were erected, {{on a huge}} scale, to accommodate new manufacturing and construction processes. These included a <b>gun-mounting</b> workshop (1881, producing gun turrets), torpedo workshop (1886), and the very large New Factory of 1905, {{to the east of}} No 13 dock, which was soon put to the task of fitting out Dreadnoughts.

It had a forward facing window and a frame that could hold forty 10 kg or ten 50 kg bombs, {{deployed}} through ventral openings. It also had an open gun position in the nose and was equipped for vertical and oblique photography. The pilot's cockpit was under the wing trailing edge with a rear-gunner's position close behind, equipped with demountable dual controls, upward-firing machine guns on a flexible mount and a ventral hatch for another <b>gun-mounting</b> covering the lower rear field of fire.|$|E

She left Portland Harbour on 27 May for Malta, arriving there on 3 June. In July, she left Malta to patrol the waters off the Mediterranean Spanish coast. Afridi, in common with all other Royal Navy vessels in these waters, had broad, red, white and blue bands painted on her 'B' <b>gun-mounting</b> so that Spanish Republican and Nationalist aircraft could identify the neutral British.|$|E

5000|$|The Germans solved {{this problem}} by inventing the Richtfläche, or lining-plane, in about 1890. This was a <b>gun-mounted</b> {{rotatable}} open sight, mounted in alignment with the bore, and able to measure large angles from it. Similar designs, usually able to measure angles in a full circle, were widely adopted over the following decade. By the early 1900s the open sight was sometimes replaced by a telescope and the term goniometer had replaced [...] "lining-plane" [...] in English.|$|R

During the war the company pioneered the development of aerial photography, producing <b>gun-mounted</b> reconnaissance cameras to photograph aerial battles. It also created an innovative photogrammetry camera for scientific and military use and a photo-finish camera for horse-racing.|$|R
5|$|The He 111Z-2 {{could carry}} four Henschel Hs 293 anti-ship missiles, which were {{guided by the}} FuG 203b Kehl III missile control system. With this load, the He 111Z had a range of 1,094km (680mi) and a speed of 314km/h (195mph). The maximum bombload was 7,200kg (15,870lb). To {{increase}} power, the five Jumo 211F-2 engines were slated to be fitted with Hirth TK 11 superchargers. Onboard armament {{was the same as}} the He 111H-6, with the addition of one 20mm MG 151/20 in a rotating <b>gun-mount</b> on the center section.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the Air Force units undergoing training and live ammunition exercises, the field firing range is also used by 552 Squadron for helicopter <b>gun-mounted</b> machine gun and cannon live fire training; 201 and 301 Squadron also use it for both air-to-air and air-to-ground training. This involves the firing of Mk-82, Mk-84, GBU-12 Paveway, GBU-49, GBU-31, GBU-33 and Mk-106 ordnance. In addition, the range has an all-terrain track certified by the National Firefighter School (Escola Nacional de Bombeiros) which is used for training by the Air Force's rescue and firefighting units.|$|R
5000|$|The Artillery School {{will offer}} nine {{different}} courses for ANA {{soldiers in the}} ranks of E-1 through O-4. Courses include the artillery captains career course, the artillery basic officer course, three basic courses, three squad leader courses, and a platoon sergeant course. Course instruction is broken down into three key disciplines: fire direction, fire support and guns. Additionally, students will receive instruction on artillery tactics, command leadership and management, <b>gun-mounted</b> vehicle movement in battery formation, radio procedures, map reading and navigation. Each cadet also receives literacy and numeracy training of approximately 68 hours.|$|R

5000|$|In 2007, the Israeli {{military}} deployed the Sentry Tech system {{along the}} Gaza border fence with pillboxes placed at intervals of some hundreds of meters. The 4-million USD system {{is supposed to}} be completed {{by the end of the}} summer. Initial deployment plans call for mounting a [...]50-caliber M2 Browning automated machine gun in each pillbox. Connected via fiber optics to a remote operator station and a command-and-control center, each machine <b>gun-mounted</b> station serves as a type of robotic sniper, capable of enforcing a nearly 1,500-meter-deep no-go zone. The gun is based on the Samson Remote Controlled Weapon Station.|$|R
50|$|American {{military}} {{research on}} {{high power laser}} weapons started in the 1960s, and has continued to the present day, with the U.S. Army planning, as of 2008, the deployment of practical battlefield laser weapons. Lower-powered lasers are currently used for military purposes as laser target designators and for military rangefinding. Laser weapons intended to blind combatants have also been developed, but are currently banned by the Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons, although low-power versions designed to dazzle rather than blind have been developed experimentally. <b>Gun-mounted</b> lasers have also been used as psychological weapons, to let opponents {{know that they have}} been targeted in order encourage them to hide or flee without having to actually open fire on them.|$|R
500|$|A {{total of}} three guns were built by Armstrong Whitworth, two for Furious and a spare. The forward gun was removed from Furious in March 1917, before she was completed, when she was ordered to be {{converted}} to a seaplane carrier. The second gun was removed later in 1917, and she was converted into an aircraft carrier. The new 'B CD' mounts were delayed, and the mount for [...] was not delivered until 20 June 1918. The gun from Furious 'A' turret was lifted aboard on 9 July, but the General Wolfe {{was not ready to}} begin firing trials until 7 August. She was given the nickname of 'Elephant and Castle', as the enormous <b>gun-mount</b> structure dominated the ship's profile.|$|R
50|$|Late January, 1503 - The Trimumpara Raja of Cochin adds {{some more}} {{disturbing}} intelligence: the Zamorin has hired {{the services of}} a Red Sea Arab privateer 'Cojambar' (Khoja Ambar), and several large ships have slipped past the Portuguese blockade and were now in Calicut, joining the fighting fleet under the command of Calicut admiral 'Coja Casem' (Khoja Kassein). The assembled Calicut fleet is estimated at 20 large ships, 40 <b>gun-mounted</b> sambuks (large dhows) and an innumerable number of smaller oar-powered paraus, carrying several thousand armed men. Although a large Calicut fleet had failed against the much smaller 3rd Armada of João da Nova the previous year, the Zamorin might have calculated that the addition of the large ships and more experienced captains might tip the balance - particularly against the heavily loaded and less-maneuverable large naus of the 4th Armada.|$|R
5000|$|Modern {{indirect}} fire {{dates from the}} late 19th century. In 1882 a Russian, Lt Col KG Guk, published Field Artillery Fire from Covered Positions that described a better method of indirect laying (instead of aiming points {{in line with the}} target). In essence, this was the geometry of using angles to aiming points that could be in any direction relative to the target. The problem was the lack of an azimuth instrument to enable it; clinometers for elevation already existed. The Germans solved this problem by inventing the lining-plane in about 1890. This was a <b>gun-mounted</b> rotatable open sight, mounted in alignment with the bore, and able to measure large angles from it. Similar designs, usually able to measure angles in a full circle, were widely adopted over the following decade. By the early 1900s the open sight was sometimes replaced by a telescope and the term goniometer had replaced [...] "lining-plane" [...] in English.|$|R
5000|$|In 1728 {{heavy rains}} silted up the harbour and {{resulted}} in the merchants of Kharak relocating {{to the area of}} modern Karachi. In 1729, they built a new fortified town called Kolachi (also known as Kalachi-jo-Kun and Kolachi-jo-Goth) on high ground north of Karachi bay, surrounded by a 16 ft high mud and timber-reinforced wall with <b>gun-mounted</b> turrets and two gates. The gate facing the sea was called [...] "Kharadar" [...] (salt gate), and the gate facing the [...] was called [...] "Mithadar" [...] (sweet gate). The modern neighbourhoods around the location of the gates are called Mithadar and Kharadar. Surrounded by mangrove swamps to the east, the sea to the southwest, and the Layari river to the north, the town was well defended and engaged in a profitable trade with Muscat and Bahrain. From 1729 to 1783 the strategic location of Kolachi saw the town change hands several times between the Khans of Kalat and the rulers of Sind. In 1783, after two prolonged sieges the town fell to the Talpur Mirs of Sind, who constructed a fort mounted with cannons on Manora island at the harbour entrance.|$|R
5000|$|The film {{received}} extensive {{cooperation from}} the Department of Defense, especially the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps. One of many problems encountered during production was {{that at the time}} of the filming (late 1963-1964), very few ships in active Navy service resembled their World War II configuration. Only one WW II vintage heavy cruiser; the [...] still retained most of her wartime configuration (and as a result she stood in for a couple of unnamed cruisers during the movie), and an accompanying destroyer, , that took on the role of USS Cassiday were extensively filmed on. Other U.S. Navy ships that participated included the cruiser [...] (though only the forward 2/3's of the ship could be shown as she had missiles aft), destroyers , , , , submarine [...] and the attack transport [...] All of the destroyers had to have their modern (1960s) ASW gear covered over with fake <b>gun-mounts</b> or deck houses. Additional smaller vessels were provided in support, as well as an HU-16 Albatross amphibious aircraft, even though said aircraft did not enter the U.S. inventory until 1949. The HU-16 likely substitutes for a PBY Catalina, of which no flyable examples were likely available for the film schedule.|$|R
5000|$|Repairs {{actually}} took much longer and modifications {{to improve the}} craft's handling were also made including a deeper step further aft, cutting away the side windscreens and new centre-section tanks faired into the airfoil instead of above the wings. Just under five months later on 3 December 1925 the Widgeon successfully completed its first flight from Botany Bay piloted by Squadron Leader Wackett, lasting ten minutes and reaching a height of about 400 ft. Following a series of trials {{carried out by the}} Civil Aviation Branch, it was agreed that the Widgeon could be tested by the RAAF to assess its suitability as a training aircraft. Prior to its handover in June 1927 another series of modifications were carried out to convert the Widgeon for amphibious operation (able to land and take off from both water and land). These included the addition of retractable landing gear, tailskid, dual controls, extra fuel tanks, an increase in dihedral from 3.5° to 4.75°, new deeper floats with less aileron interference, a wider windscreen, a <b>gun-mount</b> above the rear cabin entry, cabin side windows below the wing and a more powerful [...] ADC Nimbus engine.|$|R
