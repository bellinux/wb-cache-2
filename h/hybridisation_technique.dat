HPV DNA was detected in 16 of 33 biopsy specimens of CIN. Cells containing viral DNA were more numerous than those positive for viral structural proteins. HPV DNA was also present in less differentiated cells deeper in the epithelium. The detection rate in CIN was lower than that reported for other <b>hybridisation</b> <b>techniques</b> such as Southern blotting. In a retrospective study of biopsy specimens of invasive squamous carcinoma of the cervix HPV 16 DNA, the virus most commonly associated with cervical malignant disease, was found in 20 of 25 cases, including those dating from {{as far back as}} 1932. The level of sensitivity was similar to that reported for other <b>hybridisation</b> <b>techniques.</b> DNA positive cells were focally distributed in the invasive tumours, and most tumour cells were negative for viral DNA, a result consistent with the low copy number found in malignant cells. It is concluded that HPV 16 is not a new virus but that its prevalence is a result of changes in sexual behaviour and that in situ hybridisation is useful in the localisation of HPV DNA replication in CIN and invasive carcinoma...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the sensitivity of}} an in situ hybridisation system to detect human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in transitional cell bladder cancer and to evaluate the advantages of analysing multiple biopsies; to examine the correlation between HPV tumour infection detected by in situ hybridisation {{and the presence of}} serum anti-HPV antibodies detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); and to relate the presence of viral infection to grade, stage, and follow up in cases of bladder cancer. METHODS: The in situ <b>hybridisation</b> <b>technique</b> was used with broad spectrum and type specific (6 / 11, 16 / 18, 31 / 33 / 35) probes against HPV DNA in formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissues from 43 cases of bladder cancer. The results were analysed for the presence and type of papillomavirus and correlated with clinicopathological variables. RESULTS: The presence of HPV DNA was identified by the in situ <b>hybridisation</b> <b>technique</b> in 17 of 43 cases of bladder cancer; 12 of these were serum antibody positive and 10 had had multiple biopsies. Fifteen of the cases that were negative for HPV DNA by in situ hybridisation had positive serum serology when tested by ELISA. In 14 cases, the HPV was either types 16 / 18 or types 31 / 33 / 35, both of which carry high oncogenic risk. The stage (p < 0. 05) and grade (NS) of the tumour and the outcome on follow up (p < 0. 05) were correlated with the presence of HPV infection. CONCLUSIONS: ELISA is not useful in identifying patients with HPV positive bladder cancer, but the use of several probes and multiple biopsies increases the detection rate of HPV in neoplastic tissues. The association between tumour virus infection and high grade/high stage tumours and worse outcome suggests that HPV infection of neoplastic tissue has a negative effect on the behaviour and evolution of transitional cell bladder carcinoma...|$|E

40|$|Very {{little is}} {{currently}} known about how gender is established in Atlantic salmon, and environmental and commercial matters have {{increased interest in}} the life history strategies of this ancient fish. It is necessary to assess the sex ratios in populations of Atlantic salmon both before they head out to oceanic feeding grounds and when they return to spawn, before {{we can begin to}} understand the mechanisms that govern gender in this species. Much of the challenge faced by those studying gender in the Atlantic salmon lies in the problem of sexing juvenile salmon. It is currently not possible to sex Atlantic salmon without the need to sacrifice the individual. The principle aim of this project was to establish such a method. To this end, several approaches were taken to attempt to develop a non-destructive method of sexing juvenile salmon. The first comprises a PCR-based test to assess whether the Sox 9 a gene, known to be involved in vertebrate sex determination, is gender-specific in Atlantic salmon. The second strand of work involved the use of genetic markers identified as gender-specific in Pacific salmon to reveal whether any of these sequences segregated with gender in Atlantic salmon. In the final part of the study, a suppressive subtractive <b>hybridisation</b> <b>technique</b> was used to compare male and female Atlantic salmon cDNA, and isolate sequences unique to each. Results from the Sox 9 a study showed that the Sox 9 a gene is present in both males and females, and therefore not gender-specific in Atlantic salmon. One of the sequences identified from Pacific salmon showed female-specificity in one of the three strains of Atlantic salmon tested. The suppressive subtractive <b>hybridisation</b> <b>technique</b> successfully yielded two populations of differential sequences from male and female cDNA. The work done in this study thus partially achieved the aim of establishing a non-destructive gender test and lays the foundations of further work exploring gender in Atlantic salmon.
