25|$|The first {{treatise}} on Telugu grammar, the Āndhra Śabda Cinṭāmaṇi, {{was written in}} Sanskrit by Nannayya, considered the first Telugu poet and translator, in the 11th century AD. This grammar followed patterns described in grammatical treatises such as Aṣṭādhyāyī and Vālmīkivyākaranam, but unlike Pāṇini, Nannayya divided his work into five chapters, covering samjnā, sandhi, ajanta, halanta and kriya. Every Telugu <b>grammatical</b> <b>rule</b> is derived from Pāṇinian concepts.|$|E
25|$|Every {{context-free}} grammar {{can be transformed}} into an equivalent nondeterministic pushdown automaton. The derivation process of the grammar is simulated in a leftmost way. Where the grammar rewrites a nonterminal, the PDA takes the topmost nonterminal from its stack and replaces it by the right-hand part of a <b>grammatical</b> <b>rule</b> (expand). Where the grammar generates a terminal symbol, the PDA reads a symbol from input when it is the topmost symbol on the stack (match). In a sense the stack of the PDA contains the unprocessed data of the grammar, corresponding to a pre-order traversal of a derivation tree.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{the norm}} in {{classical}} Chinese poetry, and common even in modern Chinese prose, to omit subjects; the reader or listener infers a subject. [...] Western languages, however, ask by <b>grammatical</b> <b>rule</b> that subjects always be stated. [...] Most of the translators cited in Eliot Weinberger's 19 Ways of Looking at Wang Wei supply a subject. [...] Weinberger points out, however, that when an [...] "I" [...] as a subject is inserted, a [...] "controlling individual mind of the poet" [...] enters and destroys {{the effect of the}} Chinese line. [...] Without a subject, he writes, [...] "the experience becomes both universal and immediate to the reader." [...] Another approach to the subjectlessness is to use the target language's passive voice; but this again particularizes the experience too much.|$|E

Neither to his mind nor to hers was any comfort brought by that <b>grammatical</b> <b>rule</b> in which Miss Baker had found so much consolation. For both of them the separation was now a thing completed.

50|$|Generative grammar uses such {{redundancy}} {{to simplify}} the form of grammatical description.

50|$|The {{study of}} modern {{languages}} {{did not become}} part of the curriculum of European schools until the 18th century. Based on the purely academic study of Latin, students of modern languages did much of the same exercises, studying <b>grammatical</b> <b>rules</b> and translating abstract sentences. Oral work was minimal, and students were instead required to memorize <b>grammatical</b> <b>rules</b> and apply these to decode written texts in the target language. This tradition-inspired method became known as the grammar-translation method.|$|R
50|$|Based on the {{research}} so far, Dacica is considered lost. However, one sentence survived in the Latin grammar work by Priscian. To describe a <b>grammatical</b> <b>rule,</b> Priscian cites Trajan: inde Berzobim, deinde Aizi processimus , meaning We then advanced to Berzobim, next to Aizi. The phrase describes the initial penetration into Dacia by the Roman army. It also mentions two Dacian towns where later Roman castra were built: Berzovia and Aizis.|$|E
