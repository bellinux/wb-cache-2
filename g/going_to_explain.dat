500|$|Shakira {{felt it was}} {{something}} she had not [...] "tapped into {{for the past three}} years," [...] and its inclusion in the album resulted in [...] "very intense, very romantic" [...] songs. [...] "Antes de las Seis" [...] is one such song from the album. The Latin pop ballad was written and produced by Shakira and her frequent collaborator Lester Mendez, who had previously worked with her on songs including [...] "Underneath Your Clothes" [...] (2002) and [...] "La Tortura" [...] (2005). The musical instrumentation of the song is simple and consists of a piano and acoustic guitar. According to Jennifer Schaffer from The Stanford Daily, its [...] "softer" [...] production helps in putting the focus on Shakira's voice, which she opined had been [...] "stripped to its sensitive core." [...] The singer delivers sad and emotional vocals that address issues of [...] "longing, regrets and loneliness." [...] Shakira talked about the deep meaning behind the balladry of the album and expressed difficulty in explaining it, saying: [...] "We all go through hard moments. Whatever happened, it's right there in the songs. I've decided that I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> every song this time. It's hard to explain a song. These songs explain me better than I can explain them." ...|$|E
500|$|... "'97 Bonnie & Clyde", {{which was}} {{formerly}} {{featured on the}} Slim Shady EP as [...] "Just the Two of Us", was rerecorded for The Slim Shady LP to feature his daughter Hailie's vocals. Because the song focuses on disposing of his girlfriend's corpse, Eminem was not comfortable with explaining the situation to Kim, and instead {{told her that he}} would be taking Hailie to Chuck E. Cheese's. However, he really took her to the recording studio. He explained, [...] "When she found out I used our daughter to write a song about killing her, she fucking blew. We had just got back together for a couple of weeks. Then I played her the song and she bugged the fuck out." [...] Eminem also said, [...] "When she (Hailie) gets old enough, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> it to her. I'll let her know that Mommy and Daddy weren't getting along at the time. None of it was to be taken too literally, although at the time I wanted to fucking do it." [...] The song [...] "Guilty Conscience" [...] contains a humorous reference to an occasion in which Dr. Dre assaulted rapper Dee Barnes. [...] Having only known Dr. Dre for a few days, Eminem was anxious about how he would react to such a line, and to his relief, Dr. Dre [...] "fell out of his chair laughing" [...] upon hearing the lyric. [...] "Ken Kaniff", a skit involving a prank call to Eminem, featured fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle. [...] After a falling out between the two in the wake of Eminem's breakthrough success, Eminem instead played Ken Kaniff on skits on future albums.|$|E
2500|$|Now {{the army}} {{wants to know}} how we (the Foreign Ministry) are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> the issue. In a joint meeting of army and foreign {{ministry}} officials Shmuel Bendor suggested that we say that the army had no part in the operation, but that the inhabitants of the border villages, infuriated by previous incidents and seeking revenge, operated on their own. Such a version will make us appear ridiculous: any child would say that this was a military operation. (16 October 1953) ...|$|E

2500|$|An earlier {{agreement}} {{stated that}} {{each member of}} the LLC would only receive [...] "sole compensation for many years of service, a golden parachute of $20,000." [...] But the members now agreed to an arrangement whereby {{each member of the}} LLC would receive an undisclosed sum prior to the transfer of their ownership rights to the Burning Man Project. Marian Goodell, board member and head of communication, addressed concerns about the lack of transparency with this statement: [...] "When you’re {{in the middle of a}} storm, if you’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> all of how you got there, and how you’re going to get out, it often sets more panic among the survivors than if you just sail the boat out of the darkness." ...|$|E
2500|$|Devlin, {{who had no}} {{criminal}} record at the time, was charged with one count of kidnapping in Franklin County, Missouri, {{as well as one}} count of kidnapping and armed criminal action in Washington County.
