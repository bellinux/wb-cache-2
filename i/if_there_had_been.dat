5|$|Roddenberry {{said that}} the show would {{continue}} to cover modern themes in a science fiction way as had the first series, saying that these could include hijacking, nationalism and radicalization of both individuals and groups. He also wanted to show 23rd-century Earth for the first time, and said that this had been the answer to Paramount executives asking him <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> anything {{he wanted to do}} on The Original Series but could not. A further change was to be the number of female cast members, as NBC had a requirement of a maximum of one-third, and Roddenberry wanted to have them appear in authority positions.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1941, Action T4 became {{widespread}} public knowledge in Germany (and also in neutral countries and to Germany's enemies), and on August 24, 1941, Hitler ordered the joint chief of the operation Dr. Karl Brandt to halt it due to public protest (however it still continued, not only {{out of the public}} eye but in greater intensity). Hitler did not want to run the risk of an order publicly embarrassing him again and, as a result, the explicit order to carry out the Holocaust was given by him orally. Even <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> any written instances of this order, they would have almost certainly been destroyed by the Nazis when they realised their defeat was inevitable.|$|E

25|$|Authors {{moved in}} two {{directions}} in reaction to Charles's return. On the one hand, there was an attempt at recovering the English literature of the Jacobean period, as <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> no disruption; but, on the other, there was a powerful sense of novelty, and authors approached Gallic models of literature and elevated the literature of wit (particularly satire and parody). The novelty would show {{in the literature of}} sceptical inquiry, and the Gallicism would show in the introduction of Neoclassicism into English writing and criticism.|$|E

25|$|The state {{sales tax}} in Kansas is 6.15%. Various cities and {{counties}} in Kansas have an additional local sales tax. Except during the 2001 recession (March–November 2001) when monthly sales tax collections were flat, collections have trended higher as the economy has grown and two rate increases have been enacted. <b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> no change in sales tax rates, and {{no change in the}} economy, the total sales tax collections for 2003 should have been $1,797million, compared to $805.3million in 1990, but instead they amounted to $1,630million an inflation adjusted reduction of 10%.|$|E
25|$|The Court responded that, even <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> gender-based {{disparate}} {{treatment by}} state authorities in this case, precedents {{such as the}} Civil Rights Cases limit {{the manner in which}} Congress may remedy discrimination, and require that a civil remedy be directed at a State or state actor instead of a private party. Such precedents, said the Court, prohibit only state action—i.e., action by state governments—and not private conduct. In other words, unequal enforcement of state laws caused by inaction is, by this interpretation, beyond the scope of the federal government's enforcement of the equal protection clause.|$|E
25|$|Founded in 1531 as a Spanish settlement, Puebla de los Angeles quickly rose to {{the status}} of Mexico's second-most {{important}} city. Its location on the main route between the viceregal capital and the port of Veracruz, in a fertile basin with a dense indigenous population, largely not held in encomienda, made Puebla a destination for many later arriving Spaniards. <b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> significant mineral wealth in Puebla, it could have been even more prominent a center for New Spain, but its first century established its importance. In 1786 it became the capital of an intendancy of the same name.|$|E

25|$|Production Designer Keith Wilson {{stated in}} an {{interview}} in Destination: Moonbase Alpha that he was always being ordered by Producer Fred Freiberger to make sets smaller, taking away the expansive (and expensive) look of the first series' interiors. Freiberger was very budget-conscious and, despite press releases to the contrary, the production team was working with less money this series. <b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a budget increase, the 'stagflation' economy of the seventies would have cancelled it out. When interviewed, many of the actors state they were asked to accept less money, including Landau and Bain (who were the only ones with enough clout to be able to refuse).|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Federal {{legislation}} yields to state-regulated standard times in many diverse situations. For example, it yields {{in setting the}} normal working times of Federal employees, the recognition of public holidays, etc. The Federal government also relies on local times for Federal elections, so that the polls in Western Australia close {{two or three hours}} after those in the eastern states. Also, documents to be filed in a Federal Court may be filed based on the local time. The effect of this is that <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a failure to file a legal document on time in an eastern State, that document can sometimes still be filed (within two hours) in Western Australia.|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> doubts over Bernini's {{position}} as Rome's preeminent artist, {{the success of}} the Four Rivers Fountain removed them. Bernini continued to receive commissions from Pope Innocent X and other senior members of Rome's clergy and aristocracy, as well as from exalted patrons outside of Rome, such as Francesco d'Este. In such an environment, Bernini's artistic style flourished. New types of funerary monument were designed, such as the seemingly floating medallion, hovering in the air as it were, for the deceased nun Maria Raggi, while chapels he designed, such as the Raimondi Chapel in the church of San Pietro in Montorio, illustrated how Bernini could use hidden lighting to help suggest divine intervention within the narratives he was depicting.|$|E

25|$|On 20 July 1990 a bomb {{planted by}} the IRA {{exploded}} in the men's toilets behind the visitors' gallery. The area had already been evacuated and nobody was injured. About 30 minutes before the blast at 8:49a.m., a man {{who said he was}} a member of the IRA told Reuters that a bomb had been placed at the exchange and was about to explode. Police officials said that <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> no warning, the human toll would have been very high. The explosion ripped a hole in the 23-story building on Threadneedle Street and sent a shower of glass and concrete onto the street. The long term trend towards electronic trading had been reducing the Exchange's status as a visitor attraction and, although the gallery reopened, it was closed permanently in 1992.|$|E
25|$|Luciani had {{suffered}} a severe pain in his chest {{for about five minutes}} around 7:30pm while sitting reciting the vespers in the chapel with Magee before dinner and rejected all suggestions for calling Doctor Renato Buzzonetti. The latter, the book claimed, was informed of that episode after the pope's death. The book also revealed that, prior to the conclave that elected John Paul II, the cardinals had sent a series of written questions to the doctors who had embalmed Luciani either on 10 or 11 October to check <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> any signs of traumatic injuries, so as to ascertain if he died naturally rather than suspiciously. Doctor Buzzonetti sent a detailed report to the Cardinal Secretary of State Agostino Casaroli on 9 October 1979 detailing the episode of pain Luciani suffered was in {{the upper part of the}} sternal region.|$|E
25|$|Rod {{sticking}} {{has been}} attributed to misalignment, corrosion product build-up, bearing wear, clutch wear, and drive mechanism seal wear. Many of the failure modes that caused a stuck rod during tests (like bearing and clutch wear) would only apply to a movement performed by the control rod drive mechanism. Since the No. 9 rod is centrally located, its alignment may have been better than Nos. 1, 3, 5, and 7 which were more prone to sticking. After the accident, logbooks and former plant operators were consulted to determine <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> any rods stuck during the reassembly operation that Byrnes was performing. One person had performed this about 300 times, and another 250 times; neither had ever felt a control rod stick when being manually raised during this procedure. Furthermore, no one had ever reported a stuck rod during manual reconnection.|$|E

25|$|John Duff {{was born}} in China in 1895. Like {{everyone}} else in the British Empire, Canadians were subjects of the reigning monarch, not citizens of any country. <b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> Canadian citizenship, Duff would have qualified via his Canadian parents. John Duff {{can be found on the}} Canadian Census for both 1901 and 1911. There was a category for “Nationality”. In both cases, Duff’s was listed as Canadian. When John Duff started racing in 1920, he had lived a significant part of his life in Canada. Although there was no Canadian citizenship until 1947, Canada had issued its own passports since the 1860s. As late as 1932, John Duff carried a Canadian passport — which means that he carried one throughout his racing career. In a newspaper interview given after his last crash, Duff was clear about his Canadian origins. Finally, and most conclusively, John Duff’s eldest son and daughter have no doubt that their father was a Canadian.|$|E
25|$|At common law, as for {{all forms}} of misrepresentation, {{innocent}} misrepresentation {{gave rise to the}} right to rescind a contract. It was not possible to get damages, but so long as one was not confronted by a bar to rescission, the misrepresentee had a right to escape the contract. When the Misrepresentation Act 1967 was passed, it was decided that this right to rescission could be used {{in a way that was}} unfair on a misrepresentor. So section 2(2) gives the court a discretion about whether it will allow rescission of a contract, or substitute an appropriate award of damages in lieu (instead). In William Sindall plc v Cambridgeshire CC William Sindall plc claimed rescission of a land purchase from Cambridgeshire County Council on the ground that the council falsely (but innocently) stated there were no sewage pipes on the property. This would have cost £18,000 to remove, and the land had been bought for £5m. The real reason that William Sindall wanted to escape from the contract was that land prices had just crashed. The court held that in fact the contract had made the buyer assume any risk of such representations and there was no right to rescind. But <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been,</b> it would have exercised its discretion under s 2(2) to award a small sum of damages.|$|E
