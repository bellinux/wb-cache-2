50|$|In {{their study}} on {{interactive}} mailing lists, Takahashi, Fujimoto, and Yamasaki demonstrated that “active lurkers,” or individuals who spread content from an online group to individuals {{external to the}} online group, help spread beneficial information to surrounding communities. Lurkers can also develop stores of valuable knowledge as they lurk which may be helpful later should they decide to contribute. For example, users in open source software communities can quickly discover the answers to common problems, making them more likely to contribute answers later. If they have already had a question answered, they are even more likely to de-lurk and reciprocate. These behaviors form the backbone of open source technical support. Lurkers also help reduce the burden on communities. A person who may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>for</b> a community may be better served searching for the answer than forcing community members to expend effort to see and respond to their query. In the case of open source project communities, {{the vast majority of}} questions have already been asked and answered in the community, making any repeated questions wasted work. Pragmatically, lurkers also provide revenue for communities. They access pages, generating advertising revenue as they lurk.|$|E

In the last issue, we {{discussed}} how we {{wanted to create a}} newsletter that would appeal to people at every stage in their career — but we needed your help to do this. Thankfully, many of you wanted to join the conversation and add your voice to the newsletter. This is evidenced by ten terrific articles written by members of the community that span everything from high school to undergraduates to 1 st year of graduate school and to mid-career computer scientists. We urge our community to continue to add to the conversations we have started here. Please consider submitting an article proposal for our winter issue with new ideas and perspectives — or challenge some ideas presented here. In addition, in the next newsletter, we will have a special column — “Ask Judy ” where the 2011 ACM-W’s Athena Lecturer, Judy Olson, will answer questions from our community. Dr. Olson has over 40 years of experience in research and industry, thus she can answer any of those sticky questions we are not sure who to ask, but really need an answer for. <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>for</b> Judy?

In a most generalized opinion, this process is attributed to continuous generation and accumulation of Ag ions, their recharging into metallic silver followed by formation of cloud-like layers or dendritic migration outgrowths [29 – 31]. Whichever the case, by penetrating intergranual spaces in a thick-film body, the Ag ions attain a possibility for further migration between (and probably into) bulk grains composed of Cu 0.1 Ni 0.1 Co 1.6 Mn 1.2 O 4 spinel, thus leading to the second stage diffusion.|$|R

Ultimately, wine preference, and thus how one judges a wine, is a subjective endeavor. Wine professionals have long rated wines and those published ratings have some effect on consumer sales.

This study looks to try to verify that connection through insuring that best fit model development is used. For the first time in wine research, the authors have utilized Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) to compare different models and more dynamic hypothesis testing to explore the relationship between ratings and prices of wines. In the end, it was confirmed that there is a link, and the use of AIC also helped to not only confirm previous findings, but also to identify a new concern in wine ratings...|$|R
