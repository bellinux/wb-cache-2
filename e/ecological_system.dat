5|$|The {{biosphere}} is {{the part}} of Earth's outer shell– including land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphere– within which life occurs, and which biotic processes in turn alter or transform. From the broadest geophysiological point of view, the biosphere is the global <b>ecological</b> <b>system</b> integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere (rocks), hydrosphere (water), and atmosphere (air). The entire Earth contains over 75billion tons (150 trillion pounds or about 6.8×1013kilograms) of biomass (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere.) and 455billion kg (between 845billion and 975billion lb, or about 423million–488million short tons). The total biomass of all kinds on earth is estimated to be in excess of 6.8x1013kg (75billion short tons). By these calculations, the portion of total biomass accounted for by humans would be very roughly 0.6%.|$|E

25|$|Although a fully {{mechanistic}} {{life support}} system is conceivable, a closed <b>ecological</b> <b>system</b> is generally proposed for life support. The Biosphere 2 project in Arizona has shown that a complex, small, enclosed, man-made biosphere can support eight people {{for at least a}} year, although there were many problems. A year or so into the two-year mission oxygen had to be replenished, which strongly suggests that they achieved atmospheric closure.|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{policy should}} {{explicitly}} address {{the appearance of}} the landscape because people make inferences about ecological quality from the look of the land. Where appearances are misleading, failing to portray ecological degradation or ecological health, public opionion may be ill-informed, with consequences for environmental policy. This paper argules that while ecology is a scientific concept, landscape perception is a social process. If we do not recognize this difference, we have problems with the appearance of <b>ecological</b> <b>systems.</b> Three influential problems are discussed: 1) the problem of the false identity of <b>ecological</b> <b>systems,</b> 2) the problem of design and planning as deceit about <b>ecological</b> <b>systems,</b> and 3) the problem of invisible <b>ecological</b> <b>systems.</b> These problems for environmental policy may be resolved in part if landscape planners and policy-makers use socially recognized signs to display human intentions for <b>ecological</b> <b>systems.</b> Specifically, planning and policy can include socially-recognized signs of beauty and stewardship to display human care for <b>ecological</b> <b>systems.</b> An example in United States federal agricultural policy is described...|$|R
40|$|If {{conservation}} of biodiversity is the goal, then the protected areas network {{of the continental}} US {{may be one of}} our best conservation tools for safeguarding <b>ecological</b> <b>systems</b> (i. e., vegetation communities). We evaluated representation of <b>ecological</b> <b>systems</b> in the current protected areas network and found insufficient representation at three vegetation community levels within lower elevations and moderate to high productivity soils. We used national-level data for <b>ecological</b> <b>systems</b> and a protected areas database to explore alternative ways {{we might be able to}} increase representation of <b>ecological</b> <b>systems</b> within the continental US. By following one or more of these alternatives it may be possible to increase the representation of <b>ecological</b> <b>systems</b> in the protected areas network both quantitatively (from 10 % up to 39 %) and geographically and come closer to meeting the suggested Convention on Biological Diversity target of 17 % for terrestrial areas. We used the Landscape Conservation Cooperative framework for regional analysis and found that increased conservation on some private and public lands may be important to the {{conservation of}} <b>ecological</b> <b>systems</b> in Western US, while increased public-private partnerships may be important in the conservation of <b>ecological</b> <b>systems</b> in Eastern US. We have not assessed the pros and cons of following the national or regional alternatives, but rather present them as possibilities that may be considered and evaluated as decisions are made to increase the representation of <b>ecological</b> <b>systems</b> in the protected areas network across their range of ecological, geographical, and geophysical occurrence in the continental US into the future...|$|R

25|$|The {{biosphere}} is {{the global}} {{sum of all}} ecosystems.

25|$|The {{remaining}} area {{makes up}} the free-range zone—an open area which {{makes up the}} bulk of the park and where animals such as deer and jackals are left to roam free. There are more than 500 deer of different varieties and an equal number of jackals in the free-range zone. In addition, there are four enclosures for deer—each housing about 30 animals. Deer and jackals are found in equal numbers and are known for their fast-breeding ability, especially in their natural environment. The deer–jackal ratio is maintained by the 'natural method of selection'—allowing the stronger ones to prey on the weaker ones—a natural way of balancing the <b>ecological</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
25|$|Flooding {{was always}} an issue for the Plaza and the city in general.

Controlling flooding meant health benefits for Mexico City residents by preventing human waste from polluting the city during floods and controlling mosquitoes, which spread disease.

25|$|The <b>ecological</b> <b>system</b> here is {{considered}} to be recently evolved with a number of endemic species. The lower elevations are dominated by desert and arid condition plants. This includes the world’s largest species of cactus, the cardón cactus, which can reach heights of 15m. Other plant species include mesquite, chironola, lechuguilla, nopal and barrel cactus, choyas, paloadan and pitahaya. The higher elevations have forests of pine and holm oak with some deciduous forests, with leaves falling in the dry season, generally no taller than fifteen meters. Wildlife in the desert areas is restricted to birds, reptiles and small to medium mammals such as rabbits and coyotes. Upper elevations with more vegetation can have wild rams, pumas, other wild cats, raccoons, deer, foxes and wild cats. Marine species include whales, seals, dolphins, gray whales, manta rays and sea turtles.|$|E

2500|$|Much of the park's {{territory}} {{is dedicated to}} chinampas. Chinampas are artificial islands created on the shallow waters of the lakes starting in the pre-Hispanic period. These islands began as rafts made with tree branches and other materials, which were then loaded with soil and mud from the lake bottom and tied to ahuejote or other kinds of trees to anchor them. Over time, these rafts would sink and pile up on the shallow lake bottom, eventually becoming fixed islands. As these islands multiplied in number, they became separated by canals, which are necessary to keep a constant supply of water to the chinampa. The canals of the parks were created by this method. In the past, chinampas were primarily used for the growing of foodstuffs, but today, most of what is raised is ornamental plants. Much of the <b>ecological</b> <b>system</b> was restored over a five-year period, then the area opened as a park in 1993 {{in order to create}} tourism, hinder the urbanization of the area and preserve the local ecology. Most of the park's area is an aquatic environment of lakes, canals or chinampas with some forested areas, much of which are planted with ahuejotes, pines and eucalyptus. Most of these chinampas have been transformed into [...] "agro-ecological" [...] land, meaning it is an ecological preserve and farmland at the same time. This area extends from Cuemanco to Mixquic in the Tláhuac borough, all connected by a series of canals. These are what made Xochimilco a World Heritage Site.
