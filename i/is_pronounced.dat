5|$|The name {{derives from}} the British Celtic, meaning 'fair, fine, brisk’. It {{is not to be}} {{confused}} with other rivers in the south west of England with the same name.

In the nineteenth and twentieth century the River Frome became known in East Bristol as the Danny. The derivation of this name is uncertain, some suggest a nickname, taken from the Blue Danube Waltz, others that it was derived from the Australian slang word dunny.|$|E
5|$|The {{spelling}} system, or orthography, of English is multi-layered, {{with elements}} of French, Latin, and Greek spelling {{on top of}} the native Germanic system. Further complications have arisen through sound changes with which the orthography has not kept pace. Compared to European languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms, English has spelling that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation and standard spellings of words that are more difficult to guess from knowing how a word <b>is</b> <b>pronounced.</b> There are also systematic spelling differences between British and American English. These situations have prompted proposals for spelling reform in English.|$|E
5|$|Constitutional {{questions}} {{may also be}} referred to the Tribunal when Parliament attempts to circumvent or curtail the discretionary powers conferred on the President by the Constitution. If the attempt is by way of an ordinary bill, the President can exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to it. It is then open to Cabinet to advise the President {{to refer to the}} Tribunal the question whether the bill in fact circumvents or curtails his discretionary powers. If the bill is determined by the Tribunal not to have that effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day following the day when the Tribunal's opinion <b>is</b> <b>pronounced</b> in open court. When Article 5A of the Constitution is brought into force, a similar procedure will apply to attempts to circumvent or curtail the President's discretionary powers through a constitutional amendment. If the Tribunal rules that the proposed amendment does have the effect of restricting the discretionary powers of the President, the Prime Minister is entitled to submit the bill to a national referendum for approval.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) is {{fearful that}} she will be cut from the hospital's staff, so she tries to get her name on the {{surgical}} board. Stevens and Hunt operate on Randy, and it is revealed that he is terminal. Lexie wants to donate her liver to Thatcher, but she is not a viable candidate, so she asks Meredith to do it, who subsequently agrees. Randy and his wife are dismayed with the outcome of the surgery, and Stevens proposes a plan to Hunt on how they can save him. Hunt agrees, but when the surgery suffers complications, the patient <b>is</b> <b>pronounced</b> dead, and Hunt condemns Stevens. Meredith undergoes the surgery, and it is a success for both her and Thatcher. Yang confronts Webber, and tells him that if a cardiothoracic surgeon is not hired, she should be cut from the program. At the conclusion of the episode, Stevens sees the bear, and ultimately agrees that she and Karev need to relocate, out of the forest.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, {{with the}} help of William Pickering, Percival Lowell, a wealthy Bostonian, founded the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. In 1906, {{convinced}} he could resolve the conundrum of Uranus's orbit, he began an extensive project to search for a trans-Neptunian planet, which he named PlanetX, a name previously used by Gabriel Dallet. The X in the name represents an unknown and <b>is</b> <b>pronounced</b> as the letter, as opposed to the Roman numeral for 10 (at the time, PlanetX would have been the ninth planet). Lowell's hope in tracking down PlanetX was to establish his scientific credibility, which had eluded him due to his widely derided belief that channel-like features visible on the surface of Mars were canals constructed by an intelligent civilization.|$|E
5|$|On {{his way to}} {{rendezvous}} with Maria Hill, Fury is ambushed by assailants led by a mysterious assassin called the Winter Soldier. Fury escapes to Rogers' apartment, and warns Rogers that S.H.I.E.L.D. is compromised. Fury is gunned down by the Winter Soldier, before handing Rogers a flash drive containing data from the ship. Fury <b>is</b> <b>pronounced</b> dead during surgery, and Hill recovers the body. The next day, Pierce summons Rogers to the Triskelion. When Rogers withholds Fury's information, Pierce brands him a fugitive. Hunted by S.T.R.I.K.E., Rogers meets with Romanoff. Using data in the flash drive they discover a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. bunker in New Jersey, where they activate a supercomputer containing the preserved consciousness of Arnim Zola. Zola reveals that ever since S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded after World War II, Hydra has secretly operated within its ranks, sowing global chaos {{with the objective of}} making humanity willing to surrender its freedom in exchange for security. The pair narrowly escape death when a S.H.I.E.L.D. missile destroys the bunker, and realize that Pierce is Hydra's leader within S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, {{the lion}} too {{has always had}} a close {{association}} with Iranian kingship. The garments and throne decorations of the Achaemenid kings were embroidered with lion motifs. The crown of the half-Persian Seleucid king Antiochus I was adorned with a lion. In the investiture inscription of Ardashir I at Naqsh-e Rustam, the breast armour of the king is decorated with lions. Further, in some Iranian dialects the word for king (shah) <b>is</b> <b>pronounced</b> as sher, homonymous with the word for lion. Islamic, Turkish, and Mongol influences also stressed the symbolic association of the lion and royalty. The earliest evidence for the use of a lion on a standard comes from the Shahnameh, which noted that the feudal house of Godarz (presumably a family of Parthian or Sassanid times) adopted a golden lion for its devices.|$|E
5|$|The film is an {{adaptation}} of The Winter's Tale by William Shakespeare, the shortened single reel adaption of the play. The film opens with {{the meeting of the}} kings of Bohemia and Sicilia. Hermione, the queen of Sicilia, entertains Polixenes, king of Bohemia. This arouses jealousy in Leontes, the king of Sicilia. Leontes decides to poison Polixenes and orders a courtier to carry out the task. The courtier slips the poison into the cup, but he changes his mind and confesses to the murderous plot. Polixenes and the courtier depart safely, but this enrages the Leontes, who has his wife imprisoned. In prison, Hermoine gives birth to a daughter and sends it to her husband, Hoping to quell his anger. This further upsets Leontes and he orders the child to be taken out to the wilderness to die. Hermione is then brought before a tribunal, swoons, and <b>is</b> <b>pronounced</b> dead by Paulina.|$|E
5|$|The {{other two}} grounds relate to {{attempts}} by Parliament to circumvent or curtail the discretionary powers conferred on the President by the Constitution. Article 22H of the Constitution deals with attempts {{to alter the}} President's powers by introducing an ordinary bill. If this occurs, the President may exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to the bill. The Cabinet may, if it wishes, advise the President {{to refer to the}} Tribunal the question whether the bill in fact has the effect of circumventing or curtailing his discretionary powers. If the Tribunal determines that the bill does not have that effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day following the day when the Tribunal's opinion <b>is</b> <b>pronounced</b> in open court.|$|E

5|$|As regards a bill {{mentioned}} in paragraph 1, the President, acting {{in accordance with}} the advice of the Cabinet, may refer to a Constitutional Tribunal {{the question of whether the}} bill circumvents or curtails the discretionary powers conferred on him or her by the Constitution. If the Tribunal is of the opinion that the bill does not have this effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day after the day when the Tribunal's opinion <b>is</b> <b>pronounced</b> in open court. On the other hand, if the Tribunal feels that the bill does have the circumventing or curtailing effect, and the President either has withheld or withholds his assent to the bill, the Prime Minister may direct that the bill be submitted to the electors for a national referendum. In that case, the bill only becomes law if it is supported by not less than two-thirds of the total number of votes cast at the referendum. If 30 days have expired after a bill has been presented to the President for assent and he or she has neither signified the withholding of assent nor referred the Bill to a Constitutional Tribunal, the bill is deemed to have been assented to on the day following the expiry of the 30-day period. The procedure is similar for a bill {{mentioned in}} paragraph 2, except that if the Constitutional Tribunal rules that the bill has a circumventing or curtailing effect, the Prime Minister has no power to put the bill to a referendum. This ensures that changes to the President's discretionary powers can only be made by way of constitutional amendments and not ordinary statutes.|$|E
