40|$|Abstract. Machining of {{sculptured}} surfaces engender abrupt {{variations in}} cutting forces, excessive tool deflections and undesirable vibrations and therefore poor surface finish. To reduce {{these problems and}} to have a stable machining it is more indispensable to select the appropriate cutting conditions. The aim {{of this paper is to}} propose an approach for determining the optimum feedrates along tool path during finishing of sculptured surfaces with ball end tools on 03 -axis CNC milling machines using a predictive mechanistic model of cutting forces. Its steps are: 1) approximation of the workpiece geometric model by <b>dexels,</b> 2) localization of the contact zones between tools and workpiece using machining simulation, 3) prediction of the cutting forces, 4) optimization of the feedrates and 5) updating of the machining program « G-Code »...|$|R

The approach resembles the physical fabrication process of most powder-based rapid prototyping (RP) systems. It simulates an RP process {{to create a}} virtual prototype. Colour virtual prototypes may also be fabricated relatively easily. Thus, the designer can perform design validation and accuracy analysis easily in a virtual environment as if using a physical prototype. In addition to numeric quantification of the RP process, the system provides vivid visualisations of the prototype for studying its characteristics. Furthermore, the prototype may be superimposed on the product model, and the areas with dimensional errors beyond design limits may be clearly highlighted for subsequent improvement. The designer may thus analyse and compare the surface texture point-by-point of the prototype with the product design. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Slicing is an {{important}} procedure in rapid prototyping (RP) pre-processing, and can be grouped into two categories: direct slicing and adaptive slicing. At present, investigations into the use of both direct and adaptive slicing methods are taking place. However, not many direct slicing approaches {{have been reported in}} the literature. The methods are also restricted to some solids in CSG or some CAD systems. Also, approaches on adaptive slicing are too complicated. The method proposed in this paper employs <b>dexel</b> encoding for direct slicing multi-material (MM) assemblies in RP. One advantage of using a <b>dexel</b> model is that Boolean operations can be performed simply on 1 D line segments. Dexels can also be easily converted to tool paths in RP machines. Compared to the ray representation of CSG trees, <b>dexel</b> models can be extended to represent MM assemblies with material properties. Therefore, the method has high potential for direct slicing. In this paper, traditional <b>dexel</b> models are first extended for rapid manufacturing single solid and MM assemblies. Compared to other adaptive slicing approaches, a much more efficient and simple <b>dexel</b> model, for adaptive refinement in the building direction is then developed. To further improve the surface finish, a layerwise refinement approach is also discussed. Finally, the computational complexity of the proposed method is studied.

In slicing MM assembly, there will be 2 D regions of different materials. The regions need to be filled into 2. 5 D slabs.

In {{the first part of}} the paper the basic approach of modeling a thermomechanical NC-Simulation for a faster and more precise process simulation is shown. Therefore, a fast <b>dexel</b> based material removal simulation including process models for calculation of localized heat flux and forces is linked to a FE model for simulation of thermal conduction in the workpiece. Interdependencies of thermal process and workpiece conditions are considered by a closed simulation loop. In the second part of the paper the modeling of each component is explained. To consider thermomechanical effects in material removal simulation the <b>dexel</b> based workpiece model is extended by additional information like temperature and deformation in every <b>dexel.</b> An inverse projection of the workpiece deformation on a triangulated tool model allows consideration this effect by deformation of the tool model. Thereby, a realistic shape of the workpiece can be simulated. In addition, the current cutting conditions like area of undeformed chip-thickness or contact length are changed. This results in diversified cutting forces and heat fluxes. For a realistic simulation of the thermal conduction the dimensions of the FE model have to be adapted by a time dependent virtual domain method.

40|$|A {{system of}} {{algorithms}} is presented for material removal simulation, automatic dimensional verification and integrated error correction of numerically controlled (NC) milling tool paths. Several {{different approaches to}} these problems have been proposed including direct solid modeling, discrete vector intersection, and spatial partitioning. However, each of these methods suffer inherent restrictions that limit their practical application. This dissertation presents a discrete <b>dexel</b> NC verification algorithm based on a spatial partitioning technique (<b>dexel</b> representation) which incorporates {{the advantages of the}} discrete vector intersection approach. Hence, real-time animated five-axis milling simulation is supported by efficient regularized Boolean set operations, and dimensional milling errors are verified simultaneously with the simulation process. Based on intermediate dimensional verification results, a reduction of intersection volume algorithm is developed to eliminate detected gouges on the part surface. In addition, a technique for detection and elimination of unexpected collisions between the tool assembly and the workpiece is developed. These combined algorithms automatically correct tool paths to avoid gouges and collisions resulting in tool paths that are ready for immediate industrial application. A major disadvantage of dexel-based spatial partitioning, as originally proposed, is view dependency, i. e., dexels are constructed along a specific viewing vector so reconstruction of dexels is required for each new viewing direction. To overcome this problem, a contour display method is developed to transform dexel-based objects into a set of parallel planar contours thus enabling dynamic viewing transformations. In summary, this dissertation describes a unique hybrid approach to NC milling verification which provides for efficient, accurate and automatic assessment and correction of five-axis milling tool paths...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn the {{regeneration}} of turbine or compressor blades each blade {{damage is}} varying in location, size and shape, {{depending on the}} cause of damage. An important regeneration step is the re-contouring which is applied after the deposit welding to remove excess material. With complex blade shapes this step requires 5 -axis machining methods. Due to different cases of damage, the re-contouring has to be adapted to each individual repair case to satisfy the high quality requirements regarding the final workpiece. This paper combines the two topics machining strategy and emerging workpiece quality. In this context the work demonstrates a simulation-based approach for the 5 -axis re-contouring process. Hence, different 5 -axis tool-paths strategies are applied on an analogy repair case including a modelled weld shape. The re-contouring is performed virtually via a <b>dexel</b> based material removal simulation as well as experimentally by using a 5 -axis milling machine.

40|$|When {{considering}} {{the mechanics of}} grinding, several physical phenomena have to be modeled, each one having effect on the resulting grinding forces, wheel and workpiece geometry. Depending on the analyzed problem, some dependencies can be neglected to privilege some aspects instead of others. Nevertheless, all models essentially start considering wheel-workpiece engagement and the corresponding material removal (both wheel and workpiece side), deriving the forces by means of energy balances and/or shear mechanics. The meta-model proposed in this paper represents a general framework conceived for providing a time-domain simulation engine based on a <b>dexel</b> representation of wheel and workpiece, capable to “host” all the semi-empirical models existing in literature, where the overall grinding force {{is the result of}} the integration of the force contributions associated to the local removal along wheel-workpiece engagement arc. A cascade approach is adopted to solve for forces and displacements the DAEs set describing the dynamic interactions between wheel and workpiece, whereas all the algebraic relationships pertaining to the various specific models are solved in a pre-processing phase, yielding a set of response surfaces that are queried during time integration.

40|$|The {{resulting}} complex thermal {{and mechanical}} load pectrum in dry machining processes leads to temperature induced shape deviations of metallic orkpieces which changes its behavior for future use. Research projects try {{to compensate for}} manufacturing inaccuracies, resulting from the process, during the planning phase by using simulation-supported methods. The finite element method (FEM) is an appropriate tool to calculate thermomechanical behavior of workpieces by applying thermal and mechanical loads. This thesis describes the modeling and simulation of the thermal and mechanical behavior of workpieces considering material removal during the processes by FEM. In this case the FEM is linked to a <b>dexel</b> model to visualize the geometry change also in the FEM. During the mathematical modeling the heat equation is coupled to the quasi-stationary linear-elastic deformation equation on a time-dependent domain with changing boundaries. Heat fluxes and process forces are given from a process model and exist only during the tool-workpiece-interaction. These informations are project to the time-dependent bounds of the workpiece. Here a new visualization of material removal on unfitted meshes is presented. The mesh {{is divided into two}} time-dependent disjoint parts. One for the time-dependent workpiece and one for the removed material. The geometry of the workpiece is approximated on time changing bounds by adjusted adaptive methods. The analysis shows good results for the approximation with a controllable volume error. On thus time-dependent domain the thermal and mechanical workpiece behavior during machining processes could be simulated in a realistic case. During the processes the identification and compensation of shape deviations will be possible. The model can be extended for other processes with geometrically defined edges...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} for {{analyzing}} the tool-workpiece-contact area in cutting processes is presented. To gain enhanced knowledge about tool-workpiece interaction, determination of chip thickness, contact length and resulting cross-section {{area of the}} undeformed chip is of major interest. Compared to common simulation approaches, where rotation-symmetrically constructed tool geometry is used, the new method uses a detailed three dimensional tool shape model for an extended and more accurate contact zone analysis. As a corresponding representation of the workpiece and its time dependent shape-changes a multidexel model is used. To prepare the geometric tool model, the contained BREP topology is built up within the simulation system using data from a STEP-file. First of all functional parts of the tool like rake and flank faces and cutting edges are labeled for further processing. In a second step the identified NURBS-faces are discretized for the application in material-removal calculation. This way a mesh is built-up based on triangle elements which maps the geometry of each cutting edge into a 2 D parametric representation. In relation to rake face, each node is described by its position {{on the cutting edge}} and its perpendicular distance to this edge. To perform contact zone analysis each cutting geometry and a multidexel model are intersected in discrete time steps corresponding to a tool rotation of about three degrees. The intersection point of each <b>dexel</b> and the cutting geometry is calculated. Parametric cutting geometry allows for a direct computation of local cutting depth and contact length for each involved point. Based on the local values of contact length and cross section area of the undeformed chip the characteristic values for the entire contact zone are calculated and used to predict mechanical as well as thermal loads caused by the cutting process. To demonstrate the application of the novel approach, prediction of forces in slot milling of 1. 1191 steel is presented...|$|E
40|$|In the {{machining}} industry, {{there is a}} constant need to increase productivity while also maintaining dimensional tolerances and good surface quality. For many classical machining operations (e. g. milling, turning, and broaching), research has been established that is able to predict the part quality based on process parameters, workpiece material, and the machine’s dynamic characteristics. This allows process planners to design their programs virtually to maximize productivity while meeting the specified part quality. To accomplish this, it is necessary to predict the cutting forces during {{the machining}} operation. This can be done using analytical equations for a lot of operations; however, in more recent research for complicated processes (e. g. 5 -axis milling, gear hobbing), this is done by calculating the cutter-workpiece engagement with geometric CAD modellers and calculating incremental cutting forces along the cutting edge. With knowledge of the cutting forces, static deflections and dynamic vibrations of the tool and workpiece can be calculated {{which is one of the}} most prominent contributors to dimensional part inaccuracies and poor surface quality in machining. The research presented in this thesis aims to achieve similar goals for the gear shaping process. Gear shaping is one of the most prominent methods of machining cylindrical gears. More specifically, it is the most prominent method for generating internal gears which are a major component in planetary gear boxes. The gear shaping process uses a modified external gear as a cutting tool which reciprocates up and down to cut the teeth in the workpiece. Simultaneously, the tool and workpiece are also rotating proportionally to their gear ratio which emulate the rolling of two gears. During the beginning of each gear shaping pass, the tool is radially fed into the workpiece until the desired depth of cut is reached. In this study, the three kinematic components (reciprocating feed, rotary feed, and radial feed) are mathematically modelled using analytical equations and experimentally verified using captured CNC signals from the controller of a Liebherr LSE 500 gear shaping machine. To predict cutting forces in gear shaping, the cutter-workpiece engagement (CWE) is calculated at discrete time steps using a discrete solid modeller called ModuleWorks. From the CWE in <b>dexel</b> form, the two-dimensional chip geometry is reconstructed using Delaunay triangulation and alpha shape reconstruction which is then used to determine the undeformed chip area along the cutting edge. The cutting edge is discretized into nodes with varying cutting directions (tangential, feed, and radial), inclination angle, and rake angle. If engaged in cutting during a time step, each node contributes an incremental three dimensional force vector calculated with the oblique cutting force model. Using a 3 -axis dynamometer, the cutting force prediction algorithm was experimentally verified on a variety of processes and gears which included an internal spur gear, external spur gear, and external helical gear. The simulated and measured force profiles correlate very closely (about 3 - 10 % RMS error) with the most error occurring in the external helical gear case. These errors may be attributable due to rubbing of the tool which is evident through visible gouges on the finished workpiece, tool wear on the helical gear shaper, and different cutting speed than the process for which the cutting coefficients were calibrated. More experiments are needed to verify the sources of error in the helical gear case. To simulate elastic tool deflection in gear shaping, the tool’s static stiffness is estimated from impact hammer testing. Then, based on the predicted cutting force, the elastic deflection of the tool is calculated at each time step. To examine the affect of tool deflection on the final quality of the gear, a virtual gear measurement module is developed and used to predict the involute profile deviations in the virtually machined part. Simulated and measured profile deviations were compared for a one-pass external spur gear process and a two-pass external spur gear process. The simulated profile errors correlate very well with the measured profiles on the left flank of the workpiece, however additional research is needed to improve the accuracy of the model on the right flank. Furthermore, the model also serves as a basis for future research in dyamic vibrations in gear shaping. The above-mentioned algorithms have been implemented into a tool called ShapePRO (developed in C++). The software is meant for process planners to be able to simulate the gear shaping operation virtually and inspect the resulting quality of the gear. Accordingly, the user may iterate the process parameters to maximize productivity while meeting the customer’s desired gear quality...|$|E
