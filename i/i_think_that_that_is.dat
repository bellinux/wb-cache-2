500|$|The {{topic of}} {{abortion}} is a prominent theme in [...] "Secrets". After discovering {{that she is}} pregnant, Lori asks Glenn to retrieve with emergency contraception pills from the pharmacy. Upon returning, an infuriated Maggie hands Lori her pills. Dale gently confronts her about her pregnancy when he sees that she becomes nauseated at the smell of cooking meat, and Lori explains that Rick is the biological father of the child. Writer Robert Kirkman opined that such assertions were [...] "wishful thinking". [...] "She was with those two men very close to each other. There was not a large span of time between her time with Shane and then Rick's return and her time with Rick. It's definitely {{up in the air}} and it’s not like there's a lot of paternity tests floating around out there." [...] Kirkman felt that he had to responsibly approach controversial issues from a neutral standpoint and insisted that abortion should warrant discussion, considering the circumstances. He stated: [...] "As far as the abortion stuff goes, it’s really just a matter of being realistic. These are the kinds of issues that people deal with in real life and in this situation <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the kind of thought process that Lori Grimes would be going through." ...|$|E
2500|$|About {{contemporary}} American {{poetry and}} her own risk-taking in her work she said: “Perhaps there's a fear of revealing too much emotion in American poetry, despite the go-ahead of a sort from confessional poetry. At any rate, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> my goal—I mean I never want to say ‘I have plenty of heart,’ but I {{want to be able}} to say whatever I feel without fear or embarrassment.” ...|$|E
2500|$|RTÉ {{journalist}} Philip Boucher-Hayes said {{other media}} sources had misreported his words {{in order to}} erroneously claim that nuns had deliberately starved children to death: [...] "Today on BBC TV I said malnutrition was listed as cause of death at other mother-and-baby homes. Several outlets [...] now quoting me as [...] source for the unsupportable claim that ‘nuns starved 800 babies to death’ before dumping them in a septic tank. So just in case this needs clarification, I said nothing of the sort." [...] Boucher-Hayes also spoke of embarrassment felt by locals at the revelations: [...] "Talk to anybody else and there's a bit of hand wringing, there's a bit of chest beating {{and a lot of}} 'ah sure, those were the times, weren't they, what's the point in going and unearthing it now'. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> an embarrassment about our past that is probably replicated in so many places where there were industrial schools, where there were mother and baby homes and where there is now the suspicion in Cork, in Westmeath, in Tipperary that there are very, very large communal graves of unmarked bodies, unknown about, un-commemorated, discarded bodies." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I know he {{was very}} sick about his brother looking too closely into his concerns. He has a little affair on just now {{that he wants to}} keep to himself, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the reason he went off so quietly." ...|$|E
60|$|In fact, I {{came near}} to impaling myself upon his point for my pains; but right {{was on my}} side, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> must give a man greater {{confidence}} than though he knew himself to be battling in a wicked cause.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> {{was perhaps}} the intention, but none but a {{seasoned}} Christian Scientist can examine a literary animal of Mrs. Eddy's creation and tell which end of it the tail is on. She is easily the most baffling and bewildering writer in the literary trade.|$|R
6000|$|... "You must please {{not make}} any {{difference}} or alter your arrangements on my account," [...] she said.

6000|$|The Christian-Scientist {{engineer}} drives {{exactly the}} same trade as the other engineers, yet he out-prospers the whole of them put together.

6000|$|I am {{subject to}} correction, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> about what Mrs. Eddy was {{intending}} to convey.

6000|$|He was {{sixty years}} old when I saw him. He is called Sri 108 Swami Bhaskarananda Saraswati.

5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{if you pay}} {{attention}} to life and the way things are, <b>that</b> you, you come out pretty jaded by, you know, life.

We go to trips sometimes and nothing happened. Or sometime we go on a trip and everything happens at once; you never know. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> translates very much into Johns way of life—whether its hunting, fishing , or whatever, Johns Cardiel an outdoorsman, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>that</b> hearty spirit of America translated very well with Julians gritty grime of, like, the city slime, into making a really solid, [...] "This is what it is to us." ...|$|R

"It {{has become}} known," [...] he continued, [...] "that Richard {{was one of}} the early {{plotters}} who paved the way for Monmouth's coming. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that,</b> in conjunction with his betrayal of his trust <b>that</b> night at Newlington's, thereby causing the death of some twenty gallant fellows of King James's, will be enough to hang him." ...|$|R

And it isn't your proposition--no, that doesn't fascinate me; it's something else, I don't quite know what; something that's born in you and oozes out of you, I suppose.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{not quite}} fair to Harriet. We have no {{certainty}} {{that she knew}} Cornelia had turned {{him out of the}} house. He went back to Cornelia, and Harriet may have supposed that he was as happy with her as ever. Still, it was judicious to begin to lay on the whitewash, for Shelley is going to need many a coat of it now, and the sooner the reader becomes used to the intrusion of the brush the sooner he will get reconciled to it and stop fretting about it.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{just the}} good, the {{exquisite}} things in life, {{that make me}} rebel against this life we are leading. It's because I've seen the streaks of gold that I know the rest for dirt. When I go cheating and scheming to my office, {{and come back to}} find you squandering yourself upon a horde of chattering, overdressed women, when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> our substance and everyday and what we are, then it is I remember most the deep and beautiful things.... It is impossible, dear, it is intolerable that life was made beautiful for us--just for these vulgarities." ...|$|E
6000|$|Freedom: {{what do we}} want freedom for? For this, at least; that we may be {{each and}} all able to think what we choose; and to say what we choose also, {{provided}} we do not say it rudely or violently, so as to provoke a breach of the peace. That last was Mr. Buckle's definition of freedom of speech. That was the only limit to it which he would allow; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> Mr. John Stuart Mill's limit also. [...] It is mine. And I think we have that kind of freedom in these islands as perfectly as any men are likely to have it on this earth.|$|E
60|$|The President: Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> will do. The Court is {{necessarily}} adverse to allowing {{the presumption of}} death, except on evidence of the most satisfactory nature. Still, considering <b>that</b> nearly four months have now passed since the foundering of the Kangaroo under circumstances which make it exceedingly improbable <b>that</b> there were any other survivors, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it may fairly presume <b>that</b> Mr. Meeson shared {{the fate of the}} other passengers.|$|R

"I do not {{say that}} much {{improvement}} could not be made, but {{it will never be}} made by sudden and great changes, nor by men such as those who are gradually gaining the upper hand in the Assembly. The people ought to have a much stronger voice than they have in their own taxation. They see that, in England, the ministers and parliament manage everything; and that the king--although his influence goes for a good deal, and he can change his ministers as often as he likes--must yet bow to the voice of parliament. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> reasonable; {{but when it comes to}} a parliament composed largely of mere agitators and spouters, I, for my part, would rather be ruled by a king." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{foreigner}} can {{photograph the}} exteriors of a nation, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{as far as}} he can get. I think that no foreigner can report its interior--its soul, its life, its speech, its thought. I think that a knowledge of these things is acquirable in only one way; not two or four or six--absorption; years and years of unconscious absorption; years and years of intercourse with the life concerned; of living it, indeed; sharing personally in its shames and prides, its joys and griefs, its loves and hates, its prosperities and reverses, its shows and shabbinesses, its deep patriotisms, its whirlwinds of political passion, its adorations--of flag, and heroic dead, and the glory of the national name. Observation? Of what real value is it? One learns peoples through the heart, not the eyes or the intellect.|$|E
60|$|So that, you see, out of somewhere about 120 {{orders of}} animals, taking them altogether, you will not, {{at the outside}} estimate, find above ten or a dozen extinct. Summing up all the order of animals which have left remains behind them, you will not find above ten or a dozen which cannot be {{arranged}} {{with those of the}} present day; that is to say, that the difference does not amount to much more than ten per cent.: and the proportion of extinct orders of plants is still smaller. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a very astounding a most astonishing fact: seeing the enormous epochs of time which have elapsed during the constitution of {{the surface of the earth}} as it at present exists, it is, indeed, a most astounding thing that the proportion of extinct ordinal types should be so exceedingly small.|$|E
