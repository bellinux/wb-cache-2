40|$|We {{report the}} case of a neologistic jargonaphasic and ask whether her target-related and abstruse neologisms are the result of a single deficit, which affects some items more {{severely}} than others, or two deficits: one to lexical access and the other to phonological encoding. We analyse both correct/incorrect performance and errors and apply both traditional and formal methods (maximum-likelihood estimation and model selection). All evidence points to a single deficit at the level of phonological encoding. Further characteristics are used to constrain the locus still further. V. S. does not show the type of length effect expected of a memory component, nor the pattern of errors associated with an articulatory deficit. We conclude that her neologistic errors can result from a single deficit at a level of phonological encoding that immediately follows lexical access where segments are represented in terms of their features. We do not conclude, however, that this is the only possible locus that will produce phonological errors in aphasia, or, indeed, <b>jargonaphasia...</b>|$|E
40|$|Primary {{progressive}} aphasia (PPA) {{corresponds to}} the gradual degeneration of language which can occur as nonfluent/agrammatic PPA, semantic variant PPA or logopenic variant PPA. We describe the clinical evolution of a patient with PPA presenting jargon aphasia as a late feature. At {{the onset of the}} disease (ten years ago) the patient showed anomia and executive deficits, followed later on by phonemic paraphasias and neologisms, deficits in verbal short-term memory, naming, verbal and semantic fluency. At recent follow-up the patient developed an unintelligible jargon with both semantic and neologistic errors, as well as with severe deficit of comprehension which precluded any further neuropsychological assessment. Compared to healthy controls, FDG-PET showed a hypometabolism in the left angular and middle temporal gyri, precuneus, caudate, posterior cingulate, middle frontal gyrus, and bilaterally in the superior temporal and inferior frontal gyri. The clinical and neuroimaging profile seems to support the hypothesis that the patient developed a late feature of logopenic variant PPA characterized by <b>jargonaphasia</b> and associated with superior temporal and parietal dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|BY {{acquired}} aphasia {{in children}} we mean the language disorganizations resulting from focal cerebral lesions occurring during childhood. In such circumstances aphasia consists in a regression of psycho-linguistic performances which has some analogies with the aphasic disorders {{in the adult}} but differs from it in that the disturbance bears upon the function of language and, more generally, upon the nervous system during their maturation. Acquired aphasia in children is entirely different from retarded speech often unfortunately labelled congenital aphasia, charac-terized by a defect in language elaboration at the origin of which there is or {{there is not a}} cerebral lesion. Acquired aphasia in children has been known for long but a few studies only have been devoted to this subject. It is common belief that it is a rare disorder and moreover that it is remarkably transitory so that sequelae are very few or absent. Exception being made for isolated cases, the work of E. Guttmann (1942) is the earliest comprehensive review of the symptomatology and evolution. Guttmann (1942) reported 16 patients with aphasia among 30 {{children under the age of}} 14 having hemispheric lesions. He emphasized the fact that the aphasia was characterized by a reduction of verbal expression, whatever the situation of the lesion; in other terms that <b>jargonaphasia</b> and logorrhoea did not occur. The rapidity of recovery of the language was remarkable. Further-more, Guttmann (1942) pointed to the intellectual deficiencies which may last, and rightly ascribed them to brain damage rather than to aphasia. A. Branco Lefevre (1950) and J. de Ajuriaguerra (1958) con-firmed Guttmann's observations and drew attention to the disorders of written speech and to the fact that recovery progresses often less quickly than it is commonly admitted. In this paper we report 32 children suffering from acquired aphasia, studied during several years, while rehabilitation was carried out. De-tailed results of this study will be published elsewhere. We report here the general conclusions under three heads corresponding to the thre...|$|E
