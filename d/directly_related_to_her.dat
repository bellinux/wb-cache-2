Her body was cremated and the ashes were originally interred in Forest Lawn– Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles. However, in 2002, her children moved her remains to the Hunt family plot at Lake View Cemetery in Jamestown, New York, where her parents, Henry and Desirée (Hunt) Ball, his sister, Lucille Ball, and her grandparents are buried.|$|E
25|$|Dayhoff's Atlas {{became a}} {{template}} for many indispensable tools in large portions of DNA or protein-related biomedical research. In spite of this significant contribution, Dayhoff was marginalized by the community of sequencers. The contract to manage GenBank (a technology <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> research), awarded in the early 1980s by the NIH, went to Walter Goad at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The reason for this attitude was unknown, with theories ranging from sexism to a clash of values with the experimental science community. Despite the success of Dayhoff's Atlas, experimental scientists and researchers considered their sequence information very valuable and were often reluctant to submit it to such a publicly available database.|$|E
5000|$|The name ahwahnee {{comes from}} Utian and Nahuatl {{languages}} ahwwahnee, ahuia or ahweeya, which John Bierhorst (1985:657, 730) translates as [...] "good smelling". The Ahwahnees were typically educated since their childhood, to be pleasant to others, metaphorically [...] "good smelling"; a metaphor also <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> Xochiquetzal and <b>her</b> symbolic relationship with blossoms and the Earth's rebirth.|$|R
5000|$|Other Marxist-feminist {{criticism}} {{has also been}} produced including Rosenfelt’s essay “From the Thirties: Tillie Olsen and the Radical Tradition.” [...] Rosenfelt worked directly with Olsen while writing this article and {{she looks at the}} many ways in which Olsen's biography <b>directly</b> <b>relates</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> works of fiction, especially Yonnondio. By comparing Yonnondio with Agnes Smedley’s Daughter of Earth, Rosenfelt reveals the ways in which female sexuality is downplayed in the novel. Rosenfelt suggests this occurs {{as a direct result of}} Olsen’s readings of communist theory, much of which was surprisingly conservative and patriarchal in its attitudes towards women in the 1930s. Rosenfelt also argues that the Holbrook children (especially Mazie) are explicitly socialized into accepting traditional, limiting views of sex and gender. Rosenfelt links the cruel behaviors of Anna (her abuse of her children) directly back to the inevitable result of living within a patriarchal, capitalist regime.Other notable {{criticism has}} been produced regarding Olsen’s representations of Jewishness in Yonnondio. Lyons has argued that, although somewhat sparsely portrayed, Olsen’s own Jewish background is uniquely represented within the characterization of Anna during her recollections of her grandmother, and also her numerous candle-lighting rituals. Lyons links Anna’s practices with the behaviors of Eva in Olsen’s famous short story [...] "Tell Me a Riddle." ...|$|R

2500|$|During the {{founding}} {{phase of the}} colony cycle, many foundresses leave their nests and join another. [...] Foundresses that move most frequently join the nest of a full sister, yet do not increase their reproductive rank upon joining a new nest. The moving foundress usually lays her eggs at her previous nest, so joining a new nest is a surprising behavior as the offspring will not be <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> These moving foundresses help care for the offspring, which {{has been shown to}} be very important for the survival of the colony. [...] Colonies with subordinate foundresses have a much higher success rate and higher productivity than solitary colonies.|$|E

40|$|Pornography, {{domestic}} entreprenemship, and gay tourism. This thesis explores it all. The author did {{not fully}} explore porn until college and believes that doing so made her a strong believer in its resistive potential. This chapter <b>relates</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own sexual trials and she credits <b>her</b> experiences <b>to</b> living on a "sexually open" campus. As a college educated girl, the author was beginning the theoretical struggle between motherhood and career. After watching her stay-at-home mom go through an ugly divorce, it raised questions for her about the value that society places on domestic work. Finally, the last chapter springs from the author’s own coming out narrative {{and the ways in}} which queer consumerism offers counter sexual narratives. Each chapter begins with a brief description of a localized and momentary event, and are followed by narratives...|$|R
5000|$|Africana Womanism {{is a term}} I coined {{and defined}} in 1987 after nearly two years of {{publicly}} debating the importance of self-naming for Africana women. Why the term ‘Africana Womanism’? Upon concluding that the term ‘Black Womanism’ was not quite the terminology to include the total meaning desired for this concept, I decided that ‘Africana Womanism,’ a natural evolution in naming, was the ideal terminology for two basic reasons. The {{first part of the}} coinage, Africana, identifies the ethnicity of the woman being considered, and this reference <b>to</b> <b>her</b> ethnicity, establishing <b>her</b> cultural identity, <b>relates</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> ancestry and land base—Africa. The second part of the term Womanism, recalls Sojourner Truth's powerful impromptu speech ‘Ain't I a Woman?’, one in which she battles with the dominant alienating forces in her life as a struggling Africana Woman, questioning the accepted idea of womanhood. Without question she is the flip side of the coin, the co-partner in the struggle for her people, one who, unlike the white woman, has received no special privileges in American society.Africana Womanist ideology contributes to Afrocentric discourse. Africana womanism fundamental foundation is built on traditional Africana philosophy and values, and Afrocentric theories: {} ...|$|R

500|$|The {{score was}} created {{with far more}} {{percussion}} than previous entries in the series, and featured [...] "Blinded by Light", a recurring theme in the XIII games <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the series' central character Lightning, as a leitmotif. The theme was meant to emphasize the focus on Lightning, with several tracks <b>relating</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Unspecified ethnic musical elements were also incorporated. Each composer worked {{on one of the}} four game's key locations. Due to the game's day-night cycle, different music was composed for morning, afternoon, evening and nighttime. The thirteen-minute-long final boss theme was meant to reference the title's numeral. Hamauzu wrote [...] "Crimson Blitz", the first piece of the score and one of the game's battle themes, while on tour in Switzerland. Unlike the previous two games, Lightning Returns did not feature a theme song as it was felt that this would diminish the emotional impact of the ending. Instead, the composers created a purely orchestral piece. The final theme, [...] "Epilogue", was co-composed by Hamauzu and Nakama. It was based on the concept of the XIII games coming to an end, and so was intended to convey the themes and atmosphere of the soundtrack. Nakama created multiple versions of the piece and sent them to Hamauzu, who performed alterations and made the final choice. The game also featured multiple musical Easter eggs, including tunes from previous entries in the franchise.|$|R
