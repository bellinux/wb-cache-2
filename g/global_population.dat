The Antarctic blue whale population is growing at the relatively rapid rate of about 7.3% per year, but it was hunted to such a low level that it remains at a tiny fraction of pre-whaling numbers. The <b>global</b> <b>population</b> still requires protection, but it is not in immediate danger of extinction.|$|E

5|$|Although the red-throated loon {{is not a}} {{globally}} threatened species, as it has a {{large population}} and a significant range, there are populations which appear to be declining. Numbers counted in U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service surveys in Alaska show a 53% population decline between 1971 and 1993, for example, and survey count numbers have dropped in continental Europe as well. In Scotland, on the other hand, the population increased by some 16% between 1994 and 2006, according to surveys done by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Scottish Natural Heritage. In 2002, Wetlands International estimated a <b>global</b> <b>population</b> of 490,000 to 1,500,000individuals; <b>global</b> <b>population</b> trends have not been quantified.|$|E

However, some populations, particularly on islands such as Corsica and La Palma are small and isolated.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{abundance}} of insects and a worldwide concern of food shortages, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations considers that the world may have to, in the future, regard the prospects of eating insects as a food staple.

5|$|The {{species has}} {{declined}} in numbers {{in parts of}} northern and western Europe since the 1980s due to fewer grassland invertebrates being available as food for growing chicks.

5|$|A {{study of}} the {{southern}} carmine bee-eater in Zimbabwe showed that it was affected by deliberate interference and persecution and loss of woodlands, and that nesting sites are lost though poor water management leading to river bank damage, dam construction and panning for gold. Colonies are becoming concentrated into the national parks and the Zambezi Valley. The well-studied European bee-eater is trapped and shot on migration in countries bordering the Mediterranean, an estimated 4,000–6,000 annually being killed in Cyprus alone, but with a <b>global</b> <b>population</b> of between 170,000 and 550,000 pairs even losses on that scale make little overall impact.|$|E

The number of deaths is projected to increase further because of higher smoking rates in the developing world, and an aging population in many countries. It resulted in an estimated economic cost of $2.1trillion in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of the European {{population}} of the European nightjar range from 470,000 to more than 1million birds, suggesting a total <b>global</b> <b>population</b> of 2–6million individuals.

The huge breeding range and population mean that this species is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|Humpback whales were hunted {{as early}} as the 18th century. By the 19th century, many nations (the United States in particular), were hunting the animal heavily in the Atlantic Ocean {{and to a lesser extent}} in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The late-19th-century {{introduction}} of the explosive harpoon allowed whalers to accelerate their take. This, along with hunting in the Antarctic Ocean beginning in 1904, sharply reduced whale populations. During the 20th century, over 200,000 humpbacks were taken, reducing the <b>global</b> <b>population</b> by over 90%. North Atlantic populations dropped to as low as 700 individuals.|$|E
5|$|The Alpine chough has an {{extensive}} though sometimes fragmented range, estimated at 1–10millionsquare kilometres (0.4–3.8million sq mi), {{and a large}} population, including an estimated 260,000 to 620,000 individuals in Europe. The Corsican population has been estimated to comprise about 2,500 birds. Over its range as a whole, the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the <b>global</b> <b>population</b> decline criteria of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} {{population of}} brown and Peruvian pelicans {{is estimated at}} 650,000 birds, with around 250,000 in the United States and Caribbean, and 400,000 in Peru. The National Audubon Society estimates the <b>global</b> <b>population</b> of the brown pelican at 300,000. Numbers of brown pelican plummeted in the 1950s and 1960s, largely {{as a consequence of}} environmental DDT pollution, and the species was listed as endangered in the US in 1970.
