However, {{the association of}} Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and hypercalcemia is rare: {{to the best of}} our knowledge, only two cases have previously been reported, and neither had a clear documentation of the etiology of the hypercalcemia. Case presentation We report the case of a 22 -year-old man in whom disseminated infection with paracoccidioidomycosis was associated with hypercalcemia. The patient had a high normal serum level of 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D and a suppressed parathyroid hormone value, an indication that the hypercalcemia was not mediated by parathyroid hormone and might be associated with 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin <b>D.</b> <b>Conclusion</b> The episode resolved readily with administration of corticosteroids, an outcome suggesting that this is an effective treatment of hypercalcemia of this origin.

Interestingly, RTX toxin-producing bacteria specifically target this leukocyte beta 2 -integrin which exacerbates lesions and disease development. Results This study reports the sequencing of the wild boar beta 2 -integrin CD 11 a and CD 18 cDNAs. Predicted CD 11 a and CD 18 subunits share all the main structural characteristics of their mammalian homologues, with a larger interspecies conservation for the CD 18 than the CD 11 a.

The modification was aimed to optimize the number of offsprings per AI dose. Methods Ninety Charolais cows and heifers were entered into the program an average of 1. 8 times. Thus, 164 animal cases were included. Animals were administered 10 - 12 μg of buserelin. Seven days later animals without a corpus luteum (CL) were rejected (20. 7 %) while the remaining 130 cases with a CL were administered prostaglandin F 2 α, followed 48 h later with a second injection of buserelin (8 - 10 μg). Fixed-AI was performed 16 - 20 hours after the last injection. Results The pregnancy rate was 51. 5 % (67 / 130).

40|$|Abstract Background Pancreatic ductal {{adenocarcinoma}} (PDAC) {{is highly}} resistant to conventional chemotherapy, {{in part due}} to the overexpression of inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs). Smac is an endogenous IAP-antagonist, which renders synthetic Smac mimetics attractive anticancer agents. We evaluated the benefits of combining a Smac mimetic, JP 1201 (JP), with conventional chemotherapy agents used for PDAC management. Methods Cell viability assays and protein expression analysis were performed using WST- 1 reagent and Western blotting, respectively. Apoptosis was detected by annexin V/propidium iodide staining. In vivo tumor growth and survival studies were performed in murine PDAC xenografts. Results JP and gemcitabine (Gem) inhibited PDAC cell proliferation with additive effects in combination. The percentage of early apoptotic cells in controls, JP, Gem and JP + Gem was 17 %, 26 %, 26 % and 38 %, respectively. JP-induced apoptosis was accompanied by PARP- 1 cleavage. Similar additive anti-proliferative effects were seen for combinations of JP with doxorubicin (Dox) and docetaxel (DT). The JP + Gem combination caused a 30 % decrease in tumor size in vivo compared to controls. Median animal survival was improved significantly in mice treated with JP + Gem (38 d) compared to controls (22 d), JP (28 d) or Gem (32 d) (p = 0. 01). Animal survival was also improved with JP + DT treatment (32 d) compared to controls (16 d), JP (21 d) or DT alone (27 <b>d).</b> <b>Conclusions</b> These results warrant further exploration of strategies that promote chemotherapy-induced apoptosis of tumors and highlight the potential of Smac mimetics in clinical PDAC therapy. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Given n strings s 1, …, s n each {{of length}} ℓ and a nonnegative integer d, the CLOSEST STRING problem asks {{to find a}} center string s such {{that none of the}} input strings has Hamming {{distance}} greater than d from s. Finding a common pattern in many – but not necessarily all – input strings is an important task that plays a role in many applications in bioinformatics. Results Although the closest string model is robust to the oversampling of strings in the input, it is severely affected by the existence of outliers. We propose a refined model, the CLOSEST STRING WITH OUTLIERS (CSWO) problem, to overcome this limitation. This new model asks for a center string s that is within Hamming distance d to at least n – k of the n input strings, where k is a parameter describing the maximum number of outliers. A CSWO solution not only provides the center string as a representative for the set of strings but also reveals the outliers of the set. We provide fixed parameter algorithms for CSWO when d and k are parameters, for both bounded and unbounded alphabets. We also show that when the alphabet is unbounded the problem is W[1]-hard with respect to n – k, ℓ, and <b>d.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> Our refined model abstractly models finding common patterns in several but not all input strings. We initialize the study of the computability of this model and show that it is sensitive to different parameterizations.

40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} whether acupuncture induced the proliferation and differentiation of endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) in a rat model of {{traumatic brain injury}} (TBI). Methods. 104 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into normal, model, and acupuncture groups. Each group was subdivided into three-day (3 [*]d), seven-day (7 [*]d), and fourteen-day (14 [*]d) groups. The rat TBI model was established using Feeney’s freefall epidural impact method. The rats in the acupuncture group were treated at acupoints (Baihui, Shuigou, Fengfu, Yamen, and bilateral Hegu). The normal and model groups did not receive acupuncture. The establishment of the rat TBI model and the therapeutic effect of acupuncture were assessed using neurobehavioral scoring and hematoxylin-eosin staining.

40|$|Background: In people, hypercortisolism (HC) {{has been}} {{associated}} with acalculous cholecystitis and biliary dyskinesia, which may potentiate ascending biliary infections. In dogs, an association between HC and gallbladder disease recently has been documented, although the role of bacteria remains controversial. Furthermore, there is no information on the gallbladder bile microbial flora in healthy dogs. Objectives: To investigate the microbial flora in gallbladder bile in healthy dogs, the relationship between iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism and bactibilia and possible changes in biliary microbial flora after cortisol withdrawal in dogs. Animals: Six control dogs and 6 dogs treated with hydrocortisone. Methods: Gallbladder bile obtained by percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis was cultured aerobically and anaerobically and examined cytologically before (d 0), during (d 28, d 56, d 84), and after (d 28 p, d 56 p, d 84 p) administration of hydrocortisone (8 mg/kg PO q 12 h). Results: In the control group, 2 / 42 bile cultures yielded bacterial growth (Enterococcus sp.; Escherichia coli on d 0) and 1 / 42 bile smears had cytological evidence of bacteria (d 28). In the HC group, 2 / 42 bile cultures yielded bacterial growth (Enterococcus sp. on d 28; Bacillus sp. on d 28 p) and 3 / 42 bile smears had cytological evidence of bacteria (d 84, d 84, d 28 p). All dogs remained healthy throughout the study period (168 <b>d).</b> <b>Conclusions</b> and Clinical Importance: Based on the results of conventional bacterial culture techniques, gallbladder bile of healthy dogs periodically may harbor bacteria, which {{do not appear to be}} clinically relevant.

40|$|Abstract Background Nemertean embryos undergo equal spiral cleavage, {{and prior}} fate-mapping {{studies showed that}} some also exhibit key aspects of spiralian lineage-based fate specification, {{including}} specification of the primary trochoblasts, which differentiate early as {{the core of the}} prototroch of the spiralian trochophore larva. Yet it remains unclear how the nemertean pilidium larva, a long-lived planktotroph that grows substantially as it builds a juvenile body from isolated rudiments, develops within the constraints of spiral cleavage. Results We marked single cells in embryos of the pilidiophoran Maculaura alaskensis to show that primary, secondary, and accessory trochoblasts, cells that would make the prototroch in conventional spiralian trochophores (1 q 2, 1 q 12, and some descendants of 2 q), fully account for the pilidium’s primary ciliary band, but without undergoing early cleavage arrest. Instead, the primary ciliary band consists of many small, albeit terminally differentiated, cells. The trochoblasts also give rise to niches of indefinitely proliferative cells (“axils”) that sustain continuous growth of the larval body, including new ciliated band. Several of the imaginal rudiments that form the juvenile body arise from the axils: in particular, we show that cephalic imaginal disks originate from 1 a 2 and 1 b 12 and that trunk imaginal disks likely originate from 2 <b>d.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> The pilidium exhibits a familiar relation between identified blastomeres and the primary ciliated band, but the manner in which these cells form this organ differs fundamentally from the way equivalent cells construct the trochophore’s prototroch. Also, the establishment, by some progeny of the putative trochoblasts, of indeterminate stem cell populations that give rise to juvenile rudiments, as opposed to an early cleavage arrest, implies a radical alteration in their developmental program. This transition may have been essential to the evolution of a maximally indirect developing larval form—the pilidium—among nemerteans...|$|R

Should statins {{be a part of the}} sepsis treatment regimen? Not yet, suggest Terblanche and colleagues [1] in the previous issue of Critical Care. Pleiotropic effects beyond cholesterol reduction have been reported in statins [2 - 5].

Those receiving statins also had more severe respiratory SOFA (Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment) scores and were more likely to have some degree of renal and cardiovascular dysfunction at baseline. Statin adminis tration was not associated wit...|$|R
40|$|Aim. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to find out the optimal vitamin D cutoff point in predicting activity of RA disease. Materials and Methods. One hundred and two rheumatoid arthritis Saudi patients of both genders were recruited in this study. Vitamin D as 25 -hydroxy-vitamin D [25 (OH) D] was measured and serum level less than 20 [*]ng/mL defined as deficient patient. Disease activity was measured based on the disease activity score index of a 28 -joint count (DAS 28) using serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the optimal vitamin D cutoff points for identifying disease activity. Results. It has been observed that vitamin D levels were lower (P < 0. 05) in patients with high disease activity. A significant inverse correlation between serum 25 (OH) D levels and DAS 28 (r = − 0. 277, P = 0. 014) was shown. ROC curves results showed that vitamin D less than 12. 3 [*]ng/mL predicted high disease activity, and vitamin D more than 17. 9 [*]ng/mL predicted low disease activity, with good sensitivity and accuracy results regarding vitamin <b>D.</b> <b>Conclusion.</b> Study results concluded that vitamin D is a good predictor of RA disease activity in Saudi patients...|$|E
40|$|Objective. This study {{investigated}} whether approach coping, avoidance coping, or perceptions of available social support mediated {{the relationship between}} Type D personality and perceived stress. Furthermore, this research also examined whether Type D moderated the relationship between perceived stress and symptoms of burnout. Methods. In this cross-sectional study, 334 (male N = 180; female N = 154) firstyear undergraduate students completed the Type D Scale- 14 (DS 14), the Brief Approach/Avoidance Coping Questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, and the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory. Design. Cross-sectional. Results. Multiple mediation analysis revealed that only resignation and withdrawal coping, but not social support partially mediated the relationship between Type D and perceived stress. A small moderation effect was found for the disengagement subscale of the burnout inventory, with Type D individuals experiencing higher levels of disengagement at low and average stress levels. The correlations between variables provided support {{for most of the}} prediction from the literature with regard to Type <b>D.</b> <b>Conclusion.</b> Of the participants in the present study, 24. 9 % were classified as Type D. These individuals tend to use more passive and maladaptive avoidance coping strategies such as resignation and withdrawal. This is associated with higher levels of perceived stress and linked to increased levels of burnout symptoms. © 2010 The British Psychological Society...|$|E
40|$|Objective The {{present study}} {{analyzed}} the biochemical and hepatic changes in adult rats fed a high-fat diet for two months. Methods Twenty Wistar rats 90 days old {{were divided into}} two groups, a control group consisting of normal weight rats fed a commercial rat chow and a diet group consisting of normal weight rats submitted to a semipurified high-fat, high-energy diet. The animals in control group were kept on a commercial Purina® chow and those in diet group on a high-fat/high-energy diet containing 35 % fat, of which 31 % were from animal source (39 % saturated fat) and 4 % were from vegetable source (soybean oil). After 60 days of this experimental diet, the following were assessed: body weight, insulin sensitivity, blood glucose, serum insulin and free fatty acids, triglycerides, total lipids and hepatic lipogenic activity. Results Diet group presented higher body mass and insulin resistance. Blood glucose did not differ between the groups. A higher level of serum insulin and free fatty acids were found in diet group. Total lipids, triglycerides and lipogenic rate were also higher in group <b>D.</b> <b>Conclusion</b> Therefore, the present findings demonstrate that two months of a high-fat/high-energy diet increases the body weight and hepatic free fatty acids and decreases insulin sensitivity of adult rats, typical signs of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present an {{analysis}} of nominal plural markers within the language continuum on both sides of the Solway-Tweed line in the period between the late 14 th - early 16 th centuries. The Scots - English border in the Middle English period certainly was an area of political tension and one could infer that in the linguistic domain certain mechanisms must have operated as well. For instance, one of the phenomena which seem to be natural in these socio-political circumstances, would be the strife to mark own identity also in language. However, one should avoid jump­ <b>ing</b> to <b>conclusions</b> in the case of Scots and its southern neighbour. In order to study grammatical features of the area it is necessary to incorporate its history in the analysis...|$|R
40|$|Articles on team {{teaching}} and school-based problem solving teams (SBPSTs) published in refereed journals from 1980 to 1997 were reviewed. The review {{was designed to}} (a) identify the types of published articles on {{team teaching}} and SBPSTs, (b) review articles on team teaching and SBPSTs published in refereed journals, (c) summarize the conclusions of published articles, (<b>d)</b> draw <b>conclusions</b> regarding the current research trends, and (e) present suggestions for continued research in teaming outcome research. This review begins with a characterization of team teaching and SBPSTs, fallowed by {{a description of the}} review process. Results indicate that most articles are anecdotal reports or technical guides for implementing both models. Results also suggest that research of both models lack experimental designs and generally report student-based outcomes. This review concludes with a discussion of the results and suggestions for continued research efforts...|$|R
40|$|The ATLAS is one {{of several}} {{particle}} experiments at the Large Hadron Col- lider at CERN. Millions of particles are colliding in it every second and it {{is one of}} two experiments which have proved the existence of the Higgs boson in 2012. The ATLAS experiment has two main goals. The search for new physics phenomena and precision measurement of the particle interactions. It consists of a complex system of detectors and read out electronics. The cal- ibration of the whole system is essential for getting correct results and mak- <b>ing</b> reasonable <b>conclusions.</b> This thesis is aimed to time calibration of Tile Calorimeter, which is one of calorimeters measuring energy of particles issued from the collision. Time monitoring and correction is performed primarily using laser pulses. In this thesis we described the used laser method which leads to the good time setting. ...|$|R
