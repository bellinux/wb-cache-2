40|$|Under {{conditions}} of controlled pH, nitrate and ammonium are equally effective {{in supporting the}} growth of young soybean (Glycine max var. Bansei) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L. var., Mammoth Russian) plans. Soybean contains an active nitrate reductase in roots and leaves, but the low specific activity of this enzyme in sunflower leaves indicates a dependency upon the roots for nitrate reduction.

Nitrate reductase activity in leaves of nitrate-supplied soybean and sunflower follows closely the distribution of nitrate reductase. For the roots of both species, <b>glutamic</b> acid <b>dehydrogenase</b> activity was greater with ammonium than with nitrate. The <b>glutamic</b> acid <b>dehydrogenase</b> of ammonium roots is wholly NADH-dependent, whereas that of nitrate roots is active with NADH and NADPH.

40|$|ABSTRACT Redistribution of axonal enzymes as a {{function}} of time in vitro was studied in an unbranched segment of frog sciatic nerve. Cholinesterase activity moved peripherally at a rate of 99 mm/day and centrally at 19 mm/day. One-quarter of the total nerve content of the enzyme was estimated to be in motion, one-eighth in each direction. Mitochondrial enzymes (hexokinase and <b>glutamic</b> <b>dehydrogenase)</b> moved peripherally at 20 - 31 mm/day, centrally at 11 - 20 mm/day. Only 10 % of the total content of these mitochondrial enzymes was in motion. No movement of choline acetylase or 6 -phosphogluconic dehydrogenase activity was seen even after 4 days in vitro. However, in a 12 day in vivo experiment choline acetylase moved toward the periphery at a rate of 0. 34 mm/day. After a day or so in vitro the distal accumulations of cholinesterase and <b>glutamic</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> decreased, with a concomitant and quantitatively equivalent increase in enzyme activities at the proximal end of the nerve.

40|$|The fate of {{aspartic acid}} used for proline {{fermentation}} by Kurthia catenaforma was traced by using aspartic acid-U- 14 C. The radioactivities of proline and glutamic acid increased with {{the disappearance of}} aspartic acid.

40|$|The {{principal}} initial {{product of}} metabolism of [13 N]N 2 and 13 NH 4 + by five diverse cyanobacteria is glutamine. Methionine sulfoximine inhibits formation of [13 N]glutamine {{except in the}} case of Gloeothece sp., an organism with a thick sheath through which the inhibitor may not penetrate. Thus, glutamine synthetase appears to catalyze the initial step in the assimilation of N 2 -derived or exogenous NH 4 + by these organisms. [13 N]Glutamate is, in all cases, the second major product of assimilation of 13 N-labeled N 2 and NH 4 +. In all of the N 2 -fixing cyanobacteria studied, the fraction of 13 N in glutamine declines and that in glutamate increases with increasing times of assimilation of [13 N]N 2 and 13 NH 4 +, and (Gloeothece again excepted) methionine sulfoximine reduces incorporation of 13 N into glutamate as well as into glutamine. Glutamate synthase therefore appears to catalyze the formation of glutamate {{in a wide range of}} N 2 -fixing cyanobacteria.

40|$|SUMMARY: Two {{strains of}} Neurospora crassa, which require a-amino {{nitrogen}} for growth {{as a result}} of a single gene mutation (am), lack <b>glutamic</b> <b>dehydrogenase.</b> Extracts of mutant mycelium contained no detectable enzyme, although as little as 0. 2 yo of the amount normally present in the wild type should have been detectable in some experiments. Mutant extracts contained no detectable enzyme inhibitor. A balanced heterocaryon containing am nuclei and nuclei carrying an unrelated mutation produced less enzyme than did wild type mycelium, but there was no indication that the am nuclei were suppressing the activity of the non-am nuclei in promoting enzyme production. The production of the enzyme by the wild type was not strikingly dependent on conditions of growth although the addition of glutamate to the medium seemed somewhat to depress the enzyme concentration. This effect was more marked when glutamate was supplied as a sole nitrogen source.

In a recent association study in depression, which is highly comorbid with panic disorder, GAD 1 risk allele associations were restricted to females. Methodology/Principal Findings: Nineteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tagging the common variation in GAD 1 were genotyped in two independent gender and age matched case-control samples (discovery sample n = 478; replication sample n = 584). Thirteen SNPs passed quality control and were examined for gender-specific enrichment of risk alleles associated with panic disorder by using logistic regression including a genotype 6 gender interaction term. The latter was found to be nominally significant for four SNPs (rs 1978340, rs 3762555, rs 3749034, rs 2241165) in the discovery sample; of note, the respective minor/risk alleles were associated with panic disorder only in females. These findings were not confirmed in the replication sample; however, the genotype 6 gender interaction of rs 3749034 remained significant in the combined sample. Furthermore, this polymorphism showed a nominally significant association with the Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire sum score. Conclusions/Significance: The present study represents the first systematic evaluation of gender-specific enrichment of risk alleles of the common SNP variation in the panic disorder candidate gene GAD 1.

Potassium nephthenate (1 μm) in the assay solutions did not significantly alter the activity of these enzymes in the cell-free extracts of untreated plants. Leaf discs from treated plants did not incorporate 14 C-leucine into protein more actively. The protein content of leaves of treated plants was 15. 3 % greater, and the percentages of 16 individual amino acids in the hydrolysates of the proteins of control and treated plants showed numerous differences. The major changes were greater percentages of glutamic acid, glycine, and proline, and smaller values of arginine, lysine, tyrosine, and leucine in protein of treated plants. The content of ethanol-soluble (free) amino acids was greater by 7. 5 %. The principal changes in content of these acids were larger percentages of arginine and lysine, and smaller values for glutamic acid, serine, and proline in the leaves of potassium naphthenate-treated plants. The content of DNA, measured 1, 2, and 3 weeks after a foliar application of potassium naphthenate, was not significantly different from that of untreated plants, but the amount of RNA was significantly greater at all three times of measurement. The number and weight of green pods per plant 30 days after potassium naphthenate application were significantly larger, suggesting that the stimulative action of potassium naphthenate was in progress at the times of the assays. A mechanism, involving a genetic and a metabolic phase, is suggested for the stimulation of plant growth by naphthenate...|$|R

The experimental animals were divided into five groups and treated for 2 weeks with 7, 12 - dimethylbenz(a) anthracene, DMBA plus grapeseed oil, grapeseed oil, olive oil and last group was untreated and used as control. Liver enzymes, lactate <b>dehydrogenase,</b> <b>glutamic</b> oxaloacetic acid transaminase, glutamic pyruvic acid transaminase and alkaline phosphatase were chosen to assess liver function. In comparison with control, the administration of DMBA alone significantly elevated the activity of liver lactate dehydrogenase, while the activities of glutamic oxaloacetic acid transaminase, glutamic pyruvic acid transaminase and alkaline phosphatase were declined. Similar results were noted in frogs treated with DMBA plus grapeseed oil. Moreover, it is found that the changes were more pronounced in frogs treated with DMBA plus grapeseed oil than those treated with DMBA. The activities of these enzymes in frogs exposed to grapeseed oil or olive oil were not significantly different from those of controls. These results indicate that grapeseed oil effectively increases DMBA-induced hepatotoxicity in the frogs. Also, the results suggested that grapeseed oil has enhancing effects of DMBA metabolic activation...|$|R
