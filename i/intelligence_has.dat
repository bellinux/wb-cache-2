5|$|Weizenbaum {{began to}} have serious ethical doubts about AI when Kenneth Colby wrote DOCTOR, a chatterbot therapist. Weizenbaum was {{disturbed}} that Colby saw his mindless program as a serious therapeutic tool. A feud began, and the situation was not helped when Colby did not credit Weizenbaum for his contribution to the program. In 1976, Weizenbaum published Computer Power and Human Reason which argued that the misuse of artificial <b>intelligence</b> <b>has</b> the potential to devalue human life.|$|E
5|$|Elephants have a fissionâ€“fusion {{society in}} which {{multiple}} family groups come together to socialise. Males ("bulls") leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers {{for as long as}} three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant <b>intelligence</b> <b>has</b> been compared with that of primates and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness and show empathy for dying or dead individuals of their kind.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{investigations}} of bottlenose dolphin intelligence have been conducted, examining mimicry, use of artificial language, object categorization, and self-recognition. They can use tools (sponging) and transmit cultural knowledge across generations, and their considerable <b>intelligence</b> <b>has</b> driven interaction with humans. Bottlenose dolphins gained popularity from aquarium shows and television {{programs such as}} Flipper. They have also been trained by militaries to locate sea mines or detect and mark enemy divers. In some areas, they cooperate with local fishermen by driving fish into their nets and eating the fish that escape. Some encounters with humans are harmful to the dolphins: people hunt them for food, and dolphins are killed inadvertently as a bycatch of tuna fishing and by getting caught in crab traps.|$|E

5|$|Acting on a {{tip from}} Strax, the Doctor visits the Great Intelligence Institute posing as Sherlock Holmes. He confronts Dr. Simeon and find a large glass globe in Simeon's office that {{contains}} psychic snow. The Doctor speaks to the Great Intelligence, the entity that has been speaking to Dr. Simeon {{since he was a}} boy. He learns that the Great <b>Intelligence</b> <b>has</b> been controlling the snowmen and has taken interest in Latimer's pond. The Doctor visits the pond and deduces that the Great Intelligence is using the old governess' body as a DNA blueprint to form an ice creature that will retain its form and not melt. While Clara is putting the children to bed, the frozen body of the governess breaks into the house. The Doctor fights her off and is joined by Vastra, Jenny and Strax. Dr. Simeon arrives with more snowmen and tells them he wants the governess' ice body. The Doctor flees with Clara to the roof of the mansion and then to the TARDIS hovering overhead. They are pursued by the ice governess, whom the Doctor traps under a layer of frozen ice crystals. Inside the TARDIS the Doctor gives Clara a TARDIS key, but the ice governess arrives and pulls Clara down off the cloud.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to investigate: (1) which learning model of the TSTS model, the NHT model, and the direct learning model resulted in a better learning achievement in mathematics; (2) which students of the students with mathematical-logical, interpersonal, and linguistic <b>intelligence</b> <b>had</b> a better learning achievement in mathematics; (3) in each category of the multiple intelligences, which learning model of the TSTS model, the NHT model, and the direct learning model resulted in a better learning achievement in mathematics; and (4) in each learning model, which students of the students with mathematical-logical, interpersonal and linguistic <b>intelligence</b> <b>had</b> a better learning achievement in mathematics. This research used the quasi experimental research method with the factorial design of 3 x 3. Its population was {{all of the students}} in Grade VII of Junior Secondary Schools of Metro City. The size of the samples was 269 students. They were taken by using the stratified cluster random sampling technique. The instruments to gather the data of the research were test of learning achievement in mathematics and questionnaire of multiple intelligences. The proposed hypotheses of the research were tested by using the two-way analysis of variance with unbalanced cells. The results of the research were as follows. 1) The TSTS model resulted in a better learning achievement than the NHT model and direct model, and the NHT model resulted in a better learning achievement than the direct learning model. 2) The students with mathematical-logical <b>intelligence</b> <b>had</b> a better learning achievement than those with interpersonal and linguistic intelligences, and the students with interpersonal <b>intelligence</b> <b>had</b> a better learning achievement than those with linguistic intelligence. 3) In the students with mathematical-logical intelligence, the TSTS model resulted in a better learning achievement than the cooperative learning model of the NHT model, the TSTS model and the NHT model resulted in the same learning achievement as the direct learning model. In the students with interpersonal intelligence, the TSTS model resulted in the same learning achievement as the NHT and direct learning models, and the NHT model resulted in a better learning achievement than the direct learning model. In the students with linguistic intelligence, the TSTS and the NHT model sresulted in the same learning achievement as the direct learning model. 4) In the TSTS model, the students with mathematical-logical <b>intelligence</b> <b>had</b> the same learning achievement as those with interpersonal <b>intelligence</b> but <b>had</b> a better learning achievement than those with linguistic, and interpersonal <b>intelligence</b> <b>had</b> the same learning achievement those with linguistic intelligence. In the NHT model, the students with mathematical-logical, interpersonal, and linguistic <b>intelligences</b> <b>had</b> the same learning achievement. In the direct learning model, the students with mathematical-logical <b>intelligence</b> <b>had</b> a better learning achievement than those with interpersonal and linguistic intelligences, and the students with interpersonal <b>intelligence</b> <b>had</b> the same learning achievement as those with linguistic intelligence...|$|R

25|$|Bird <b>intelligence</b> <b>has</b> {{been studied}} through several {{attributes}} and abilities. Many {{of these studies}} have been on birds such as quail, domestic fowl and pigeons kept under captive conditions. It has, however, been noted that field studies have been limited, unlike those of the apes. Birds in the crow family (corvids), and parrots (psittacines) {{have been shown to}} live socially, have long developmental periods, and possess large forebrains, and these may be expected to allow for greater cognitive abilities.|$|E
25|$|Beyond academia, the {{endorsement}} of biological explanations of sex differences in <b>intelligence</b> <b>has</b> been associated with greater modern day sexism. In their research on the theorization of gender, Morton and colleagues found that people shown scientific claims that males and females are hardwired to be different, compared to those told that such ideas are under debate, expressed more agreement that society treats women fairly. Additionally, male participants became more supportive of sex discrimination at work after reading the scientific facts. Other research indicates that shifting the focus from biological to environmental contributors of behavior can decrease endorsement of sexist hierarchies.|$|E

RAW's role in the War on Terror may increase as US <b>intelligence</b> <b>has</b> indicated that it sees RAW as a more reliable ally than Pakistani intelligence. It has further come to light that a timely tip-off by RAW helped foil a third assassination plot against Pakistan's former President, General Pervez Musharraf.|$|E

After a time-travel adventure, Lord Blackadder find England an extension of France, William Shakespeare having designed the ballpoint pen and no knowledge of Robin Hood whatsoever. Edmund takes all the things he gained on his journey (besides Elizabeth I's crown) and after another adventure, gets the idea to alter the timeline to become King. Predictably, Baldrick becomes his Prime Minister, finally becoming what he desired (as did Edmund) and is the second Baldrick to rise to upper class (although after Blackadder's alterations there may be more).|$|E
