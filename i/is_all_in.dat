Huskisson told Brandreth [...] "You see I shall never live to make any return for your kindness. You have done all that is possible, but it <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> vain."

2500|$|The {{term was}} first used in English by a {{translation}} of Raphson's work in 1702. It was later used and popularized by Irish writer John Toland in his work of 1705 Socinianism Truly Stated, by a pantheist. Toland was influenced by both Spinoza and Bruno, and had read Joseph Raphson's De Spatio Reali, referring to it as [...] "the ingenious Mr. Ralphson's (sic) Book of Real Space". Like Raphson, he used the terms [...] "pantheist" [...] and [...] "Spinozist" [...] interchangeably. In 1720 he wrote the Pantheisticon: or The Form of Celebrating the Socratic-Society in Latin, envisioning a pantheist society that believed, [...] "All {{things in the world}} are one, and one <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> all things ... what <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> all things is God, eternal and immense, neither born nor ever to perish." [...] He clarified his idea of pantheism in a letter to Gottfried Leibniz in 1710 when he referred to [...] "the pantheistic opinion of those who believe in no other eternal being but the universe".|$|E

2500|$|Burke's last {{publications}} {{were the}} Letters on a Regicide Peace (October 1796), called forth by negotiations for peace with France by the Pitt government. Burke regarded this as appeasement, injurious to national dignity and honour. In his Second Letter, Burke {{wrote of the}} French Revolutionary Government: [...] "Individuality is left out of their scheme of government. The State <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> all. Everything is referred {{to the production of}} force; afterwards, everything is trusted to the use of it. It is military in its principle, in its maxims, in its spirit, and in all its movements.

2500|$|Producer Reo Kurosu has {{described}} the show's animation style as [...] "a hybrid between 2D and 3D", elaborating that [...] "For this series we’re {{trying to do something}} new. The director is a 2D animator so what goes on in his mind and what he puts on storyboard <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> 2D. From there it’s all about choosing which tool to use between full CG animation, traditional 2D, or a hybrid of the two. The director and the 2D and 3D studios will meet and discuss what to use when depending upon what we’re trying to accomplish with each scene." [...] The 3D characters and objects are rendered with Cel shading to make them look more like 2D cartoons. A particular feature is that the shadows on 3D objects contain a linear hatching effect which simulates shading with a pen or pencil, and the same hatching effect is applied to the shadows that appear on any 2D models to create a more uniform look.|$|E
2500|$|Spencer {{influenced}} literature {{inasmuch as}} many novelists and short story authors came to address his ideas in their work. George Eliot, Leo Tolstoy, Thomas Hardy, George Bernard Shaw, Bolesław Prus, Abraham Cahan, D. H. Lawrence, Machado de Assis, Richard Austin Freeman, and Jorge Luis Borges all referenced Spencer. Arnold Bennett greatly praised First Principles, {{and the influence}} it had on Bennett {{may be seen in}} his many novels. Jack London {{went so far as to}} create a character, Martin Eden, a staunch Spencerian. It has also been suggested that the character of Vershinin in Anton Chekhov's play The Three Sisters is a dedicated Spencerian. H.G. Wells used Spencer's ideas as a theme in his novella, The Time Machine, employing them to explain the evolution of man into two species. It is perhaps the best testimony to the influence of Spencer's beliefs and writings that his reach was so diverse. He influenced not only the administrators who shaped their societies' inner workings, but also the artists who helped shape those societies' ideals and beliefs. In Rudyard Kipling's novel Kim, the Anglophile Bengali spy Hurree Babu admires of Herbert Spencer and quotes him to comic effect: [...] "They are, of course, dematerialised phenomena. [...] Spencer says." [...] "I am good enough Herbert Spencerian, I trust, to meet little thing like death, which <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> my fate, you know." [...] "He thanked all the Gods of Hindustan, and Herbert Spencer, that there remained some valuables to steal." ...|$|E
