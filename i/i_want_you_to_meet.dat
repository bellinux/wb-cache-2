He came under the granddaddy law; it excused him for anything he ever did as long as he stayed working in Nevada. He told us all those things." ...|$|E

But--but--where was I?--I think your gipsying down from London was most exciting. Now do tell us all about it, Mr. Wrenn.

In other words, we buy and sell for others, with no personal interest in the sale; the bucket-shop is a pure gambling establishment, where men bet on what other men are going to do.

He {{has a great deal}} of talent, and no health or money; so he's toiling feebly for a living on a daily newspaper, instead of making literature. He was a reporter up to the time he wrote that article, but the managing editor is a man who recognizes quality; he's fond of Maxwell--that's the fellow's name--and since then he's given him a chance in the office, at social topics. But he hasn't done very well; the fact is, the boy's too literary, and he's out of health, and he needs rest and the comfort of appreciative friendship. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> him.
