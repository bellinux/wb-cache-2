5|$|Teresa Cristina {{had grown}} to be {{a vital part of}} PedroII's <b>family</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> routine. She never filled the roles of romantic lover or {{intellectual}} partner, however. Her devotion to the Emperor remained firm, though she feared being supplanted. She continued to appear with the Emperor in public, and he continued to treat her with respect and consideration. She was not rejected or slighted, but the relationship had changed. Pedro II treated her more as a close friend and companion than as a wife.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans was a {{guest in}} a Serbian highlander family {{in the region of}} Krivošije, Montenegrin Littoral. Analyzing the practices, he {{concluded}} that the badnjak customs were connected with ancestor worship. The lighting of the log on the ognjište could be seen as a solemn annual rekindling of the sacred hearth fire, regarded as the center of the <b>family</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> the seat of the ancestors. The belief that ancestral spirits dwell in the domestic hearth was attested among Slavic and other peoples. Fire worship in the old Slavic religion was mostly transformed into the cult of domestic fire, and thus joined with ancestor worship. A trace of sacrifice to the fire is the coin thrown into it by the polaznik after the ritual of making sparks fly from the badnjak.|$|E

5|$|The Skagen Painters were {{a close-knit}} group of mainly Danish artists who {{gathered}} each summer {{from the late}} 1870s in the fishing village of Skagen in the far north of Jutland, painting the local fishermen and their own <b>family</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> celebrations. Peder Severin Krøyer (1851–1909), {{who was born in}} Stavanger, Norway, but brought up in Copenhagen, first arrived in Skagen in 1882 and returned almost every summer. He had already gained a reputation for his paintings of the fishermen in Hornbæk on the north coast of Zealand and had been influenced by the Impressionist movement during his travels to France.

The dancer and destroyer aspects of Shiva are clustered in the northwest part of the cave, in contrast to yoga and creator aspects that are found in the northeast parts. This 6th-century Nataraja shares architectural elements with those found in temples in the western parts of South Asia such as in Gujarat, and in upper Deccan region.|$|E
5|$|Though slavery persisted, {{some aspects}} of the {{relationship}} changed with the French administration. Escaped slaves could find official protection by French authorities in the cities for a limited time. Slaves could sometimes renegotiate the terms of their servitude in the changed political situation. Some were willing to agree to remain in servitude if they received control over their <b>family</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> some land to pass to their children. In addition, the French administration actively worked to end slave raiding and the most clear manifestations of the slave trade, greatly reducing those means of acquiring slaves. However, for many decades after the 1905 abolition of slavery, the practice continued in much of French Sudan.|$|E
