5|$|As the West German public's {{awareness}} of the SS atrocities grew in the 1970s and 1980s, the attitudes towards Waffen-SS veterans shifted dramatically. The federal organisation and the local groups were ostracised, with their meetings and commemorations <b>greeted</b> <b>with</b> protests. At the same time, neo-Nazi and nationalist movements found in the Waffen-SS an icon to project their understanding of World War II.|$|E
5|$|Iskak's search {{has little}} success until the sisters receive news {{that he is}} looking for them, and they quickly return to Batavia. There, the sisters are <b>greeted</b> <b>with</b> open arms.

Turner oil painting <b>greeted</b> <b>with</b> critical acclaim, entitled The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last Berth {{to be broken}} up, 1838. The painting continues {{to be held in}} high regard and was voted Britain's favourite painting in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Although the ZX Microdrive was {{initially}} <b>greeted</b> <b>with</b> good reviews, it never took {{off as a}} distribution method due to worries {{about the quality of}} the cartridges and piracy. Hence the main use became to complement tape releases, usually utilities and niche products like the Tasword word processing software and Trans Express, (a tape to microdrive copying utility). No games are known to be exclusively released on Microdrive.|$|E

5|$|Amarillo's {{historic}} {{homes and}} buildings {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places reflect the economic growth from around 1900 {{to the start of}} World War II. Polk Street contains many of the city's historic downtown buildings and homes. The large historic homes on this street were built close to downtown, and homes were located {{on the west side of}} the street as a symbol of status because they would be <b>greeted</b> <b>with</b> the sunrise every morning.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of Bradman, generally regarded as the greatest batsman of all time, {{and the fact that}} he had announced that it was his farewell international tour, the Australians were <b>greeted</b> <b>with</b> much fanfare across the country, and many records for match attendances were broken. The record for Test attendance at a match in England was broken three times, in the Second, Third and Fourth Tests, and stands to this day.|$|E
5|$|Following Juventus's {{return to}} Serie A, Del Piero {{was locked in}} months of fractious {{negotiations}} over the signing of a new contract with Juventus' new management. After successfully negotiating a new contract till 30 June 2010, he was <b>greeted</b> <b>with</b> news {{of the birth of}} his first child, Tobias Del Piero. This was quite a staggering turnaround in his fortunes, as only two weeks earlier, he was dropped by Claudio Ranieri for the Serie A match with Fiorentina, and was then axed from Roberto Donadoni's Italy squad for the games with Georgia and South Africa.|$|E

5|$|In 1811, {{when the}} Parisian saltpetre {{manufacturer}} Bernard Courtois made iodine {{for the first}} time from the kelp ash, his discovery was <b>greeted</b> <b>with</b> great interest by experts. Accum was among the first chemists in England to undertake experiments to isolate iodine. In two articles published in Tilloch's Philosophical Journal in January and February 1814, Accum described the iodine content of different kinds of seaweed and gave a detailed account of a process for iodine production.|$|E
5|$|In 1863, {{three years}} after von Eulenburg's visit in Tokyo, a Shogunal {{legation}} arrived at the Prussian court of King Wilhelm I and was <b>greeted</b> <b>with</b> a grandiose ceremony in Berlin. After the treaty was signed, Max von Brandt became diplomatic representative in Japan â€“ first representing Prussia, and after 1866 representing the North German Confederation, and by 1871 representing the newly established German Empire.|$|E
5|$|In February 1938, Hitler {{emphasised}} to Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg {{the need}} for Germany to secure its frontiers. Schuschnigg scheduled a plebiscite regarding Austrian independence for 13 March, but Hitler demanded that it be cancelled. On 11 March, Hitler sent an ultimatum to Schuschnigg demanding that he hand over all power to the Austrian NSDAP or face an invasion. The Wehrmacht entered Austria the next day, to be <b>greeted</b> <b>with</b> enthusiasm by the populace.|$|E

5|$|The {{line was}} {{formally}} inspected by the Railway Inspectorate on 1 July 1889, {{and the first}} official service on the line left Chesham for London's Baker Street at 6.55am on 8 July 1889. Throughout the day large crowds flocked to Chesham station to watch the trains, and the arrival and departure of each train at Chesham was <b>greeted</b> <b>with</b> peals of the bells of St. Mary's Church. Over {{the course of the}} day 1,500 passengers travelled on the line, and 4,300 used the line in its first week of operations.|$|E
5|$|The {{successful}} crossing was <b>greeted</b> <b>with</b> enthusiastic cheers, {{the tunes}} of the Young Australian Band, the Albion Brass Band and Cooper and Bailey's International Show Band, who had {{all come to}} entertain the crowds, and the shrilling of the steamers' whistles. L'Estrange soon reappeared in a small row boat to greet the crowds, although many had already rushed the steamers to leave, resulting in a few being jostled into the harbour.|$|E
5|$|The {{years after}} their {{back-to-back}} championships saw a return to mediocrity for the Argos. Ticket sales remained flat, and there were changes in ownership. Gimmicks to attract fans were <b>greeted</b> <b>with</b> criticism. The Argos seemingly bottomed out in July 2003 when the CFL stripped control over the team from owner Sherwood Schwarz. The team had amassed debts of over $20 million, including $17.4 owed to Schwarz himself.|$|E

5|$|After D-Day, Allied troops {{crossed the}} Belgian {{frontier}} on 1 September 1944. German forces {{did little to}} oppose the liberating forces, which by 4 September were in control of Brussels, although the last occupied parts of Belgian territory were only liberated in February 1945. On 8 September 1944, the government in exile returned to Brussels and was <b>greeted</b> <b>with</b> general indifference. Although the King {{was no longer in}} the country, his Political Testament was presented to the returned Government as he had wished, and was soon circulated publicly. At the same time, a copy was presented to the British king, George VI, and was seen by the Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden. The text reignited the divisions within the Government which had been largely hidden since earlier in the war.|$|E
5|$|An eagleâ€™s {{appearance}} in the sky when thunderclouds threatened was <b>greeted</b> <b>with</b> joy and hope by people who trusted {{in their power to}} defeat an ala; after defeating the ala, the eagle led the clouds away from the fields. An explanation for this, recorded in eastern Serbia, is that the eagles which nest in the vicinity of a village want thunderstorms and hail as far as possible from their nestlings, so coincidentally protect the villageâ€™s fields as well. The role of eagles, however, was controversial, because in the same region there was a belief that an eagle flying in front of thunderstorm clouds was a manifestation of an ala, leading the clouds toward the crops, rather than driving them away.|$|E
5|$|In 1870 republican {{sentiment}} in Britain {{was given a}} boost when the French Emperor, Napoleon III, was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War and the French Third Republic was declared. However, {{in the winter of}} 1871, a brush with death led to an improvement in both Edward's popularity with the public and his relationship with his mother. While staying at Londesborough Lodge, near Scarborough, North Yorkshire, Edward contracted typhoid, the disease that was believed to have killed his father. There was great national concern, and one of his fellow guests (Lord Chesterfield) died. Edward's recovery was <b>greeted</b> <b>with</b> almost universal relief. Public celebrations included the composition of Arthur Sullivan's Festival Te Deum. Edward cultivated politicians from all parties, including republicans, as his friends, and thereby largely dissipated any residual feelings against him.|$|E
