25|$|Fish {{otoliths}} accrete {{layers of}} calcium carbonate and gelatinous matrix throughout their lives. The accretion rate varies with {{growth of the}} fish – often less growth in winter and more in summer – which results in the appearance of rings that resemble tree rings. By counting the rings, {{it is possible to}} determine the age of the fish in years. Typically the sagitta is used, as it is largest, but sometimes lapilli are used if they have a more convenient shape. The asteriscus, which is smallest of the three, is rarely used in age and <b>growth</b> <b>studies.</b>|$|E

25|$|Astrocytes are glial {{cells that}} are {{abundant}} in {{the central nervous system}}. They are crucial for the metabolic and trophic support of neurons; additionally, astrocytes provide ion buffering and neurotransmitter clearance. Growing axons are guided by cues created by astrocytes; thus, astrocytes can regulate neurite pathfinding and subsequently, patterning in the developing brain. The glial scar that forms post-injury in the central nervous system is formed by astrocytes and fibroblasts; it is the most significant obstacle for regeneration. The glial scar consists of hypertrophied astrocytes, connective tissue, and ECM. Two goals of neural tissue engineering are to understand astrocyte function and to develop control over astrocytic <b>growth.</b> <b>Studies</b> by Shany et al. (2006) have demonstrated that astrocyte survival rates are increased on 3D aragonite matrices compared to conventional 2D cell cultures. The ability of cell processes to stretch out across curves and pores allows for the formation of multiple cell layers with complex 3D configurations.|$|E
2500|$|Hard tissues such as bone {{require a}} {{relatively}} high energy photon source, and typically a tungsten anode is used with a high voltage (50-150 kVp) on a 3-phase or high-frequency machine to generate bremsstrahlung or braking radiation. [...] Bony tissue and metals are denser than the surrounding tissue, and thus by absorbing more of the X-ray photons they prevent the film from getting exposed as much. [...] Wherever dense tissue absorbs or stops the X-rays, the resulting X-ray film is unexposed, and appears translucent blue, whereas the black parts of the film represent lower-density tissues such as fat, skin, and internal organs, which could not stop the X-rays. [...] This is usually used to see bony fractures, foreign objects (such as ingested coins), and used for finding bony pathology such as osteoarthritis, infection (osteomyelitis), cancer (osteosarcoma), as well as <b>growth</b> <b>studies</b> (leg length, achondroplasia, scoliosis, etc.).|$|E

Mucor plumbeus can also use sucrose, D-mannose, D-sorbitol and citric acid as sources of carbon. Zygospores were found to be unable to grow in culture.

Mucor plumbeus can cause self inhibition of its germinating spores with the production of certain factors such as nonanoic acid. In a study conducted to determine the antifungal capabilities of different mixtures of cinnamon and clove oil against various important spoilage microorganisms, M. plumbeus was discovered to be amongst the most resistant organisms. This study also revealed that thymol has effective inhibitory action against M. plumbeus. In nature, M. plumbeus can be found in soils with a wide range in pH - particularly into the alkaline range. The minimum water activity (aw) for growth was reported to be 0.93. The growth of M. plumbeus varied with different gas concentrations. Growth in N was 80% of that in air. Growth also occurred in an atmosphere of more than 97% CO with trace amounts of O. Growth on cheddar cheese in an atmosphere of: 20% CO and 5% O was 50% of that in air; 20% CO and 1% O was 40% of that in air; 40% CO and 5% O was 50% of that in air; 40% CO and 1% O was 30% [...] of that in air.|$|E
50|$|The Oakland <b>growth</b> <b>study</b> {{is one of}} Cover Jones' most {{influential}} <b>studies.</b> The Oakland <b>growth</b> <b>study</b> was the third {{in a series of}} longitudinal studies from Berkeley College. The first study in the trio was the Berkeley <b>Growth</b> <b>Study,</b> looking at newborns (1928), followed by the Berkeley Guidance study, looking at preschool age children (1928). Both studies were done by looking at children living in Berkeley, California. The Oakland <b>Growth</b> <b>Study</b> (OGS) was led by Cover Jones and her husband. The study began in 1932 in Oakland, California. The Study followed 212 students in the fifth and sixth grade who were born between the years 1920-1921. The participants were studied twice a year until they graduated from high school. The study's primary goal was to understand typical adolescence. They looked at physical abilities, physiological changes, and peer relationships. They were then studied in adulthood at ages 38, 48, and 60 years old. The studies in adulthood consisted of interviews, questionnaires, personality inventories, and health assessments. The final interview of participants took place in 1980, when Cover Jones was 83 years old.|$|R
