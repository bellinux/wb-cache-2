5|$|Across Micronesia, {{impact from}} the typhoon was fairly limited. Winds on Nukuoro were {{estimated}} at 45–75km/h (30–45mph), resulting in minor {{damage to buildings}} and crops. Losses on the atoll reached $10,000. Lukunor, located <b>farther</b> <b>west,</b> experienced similar winds; however, damage was slightly more severe. Notable coastal impact took place, with portions of the dock and sea wall damaged. Damage across Lukunor and nearby islands amounted to $20,000.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{single-storey}} {{building from}} the 1950s was demolished on Grey Friars Street giving archaeologists {{the opportunity to}} excavate and search for traces of the medieval friary. Very little was unearthed, except for a fragment of a post-medieval stone coffin lid. The results of the dig suggested that {{the remains of the}} friary church were <b>farther</b> <b>west</b> than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|The Australasian Antarctic Expedition, {{commanded}} by Douglas Mawson, explored part of East Antarctica between 1911 and 1914. The expedition's main base {{was established in}} January 1912 at Cape Denison in Commonwealth Bay, Adélie Land. This was much <b>farther</b> <b>west</b> than originally intended; dense pack ice had prevented the expedition ship SY Aurora from landing closer to Cape Adare, the original eastern limit. Only after the Aurora—heading west—had rounded the ice tongue of the Mertz Glacier was a landing made.|$|E

50|$|There are two {{recognized}} subspecies. The ssp. praemorsa is {{more widespread}} farther south, to Texas and New Mexico, and the ssp. virginiana extends <b>farther</b> north and <b>west.</b>|$|R
50|$|Deerfield {{survived the}} raid, and the {{frontier}} was pushed <b>farther</b> north and <b>west.</b> Settlers eventually moved into present-day Vermont and established settlements {{farther up the}} Connecticut River in New Hampshire.|$|R
5|$|The highway was {{designated}} by 1919 along a route that ran much <b>farther</b> <b>west</b> in the UP. Within its first decade, M-48 {{was extended to}} end at a point north of Newberry. Since the 1960s, it has had its current configuration. A section of roadway that was previously used {{as part of the}} western end of the highway was redesignated as a section H-40 in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|John and Kanyenke {{then set}} out to follow Warwick, first earning {{the respect of the}} Great Plains tribes by good deeds and helping to defend them against Warwick's forces, then they {{intercept}} Warwick's supply train and destroy a fortified Circle base in the mountains. They soon discover that Warwick and his soldiers have fled even <b>farther</b> <b>west,</b> to act as a checkpoint at Alaska, where they notice the Circle's new ally, the Russians. They realize that the Circle plans to capture British and French colonies and towns while their soldiers are at war with one another, and that Warwick wants the Circle of Ossus as the new leader of the New World.|$|E
5|$|To {{counter the}} Austrians, the French fielded {{an even larger}} array of forces. From Frankfurt am Main, Pierre Augereau and 16,000 troops {{threatened}} Simbschen's northern wing. Moreau controlled 107,000 of the main army, deployed in four wings. Bruneteau de Saint-Suzanne's 24,000-strong detached force occupied the north bank of the Danube near Ingolstadt, Grenier's 24,000-man Left Wing deployed {{on the west bank}} of the Isar River near Landshut. Moreau massed the 36,000 soldiers of the Center around Munich under his personal control. The Right Wing of Lecourbe defended the line of the upper Lech River <b>farther</b> <b>west.</b> Lastly, Jacques MacDonald with the 18,000-strong Army of the Grisons threatened Hiller's force from Switzerland.|$|E

50|$|The only crater of note in {{this range}} is Bianchini, which lies across the north-northwestern {{portion of the}} curve. A little <b>farther</b> to the <b>west</b> is Sharp, and to the {{northeast}} is the ruined crater Maupertuis.|$|R
5|$|Among African slaves, Catholicism was the {{religion}} of the majority. Most slaves came originally from the midwestern and southwestern portions of the African coast. For over four centuries this region had been the subject of Christian mission activities. Some Africans and their descendants, however, held onto elements of polytheistic religious traditions by merging them with Catholicism. This resulted in the creation of syncretic creeds such as Candomblé. Islam was also practiced among a small minority of African slaves, although it was harshly repressed {{and by the end of}} the 19th century had been completely extinguished. By the beginning of the 19th century, the Indians in most of eastern Brazil had been either assimilated or decimated. Some tribes resisted assimilation and either fled <b>farther</b> <b>west,</b> where they were able to maintain their diverse polytheistic beliefs, or were restricted to aldeamentos (reservations), where they eventually converted to Catholicism.|$|E
5|$|I-190 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with the New York State Thruway (I-90) in Cheektowaga in Erie County, {{just north of}} the West Seneca town line and east of the Buffalo city line. I-190 heads west into Buffalo, passing the former location of the City Line toll barrier ahead of an interchange with South Ogden Street (exit1). <b>Farther</b> <b>west,</b> I-190 meets NY354 (exit2), NY16 (exit3), and several local streets before entering downtown Buffalo. Within the downtown area, I-190 passes between KeyBank Center and Coca-Cola Field near an interchange with NY5 (exit7) on the shores of Lake Erie. At NY5, I-190 turns northward to follow the path of the Niagara River. Shortly after meeting NY266 (exit8) immediately northwest of downtown, I-190 interchanges with Porter Avenue (exit9), a local roadway connecting I-190 to the Peace Bridge and, thus, the Queen Elizabeth Way in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Impacts {{throughout}} the Windward Islands were substantial, but most heavily concentrated in St. Lucia. There, gusts reached 69mph (110km/h), toppling trees and power lines. Torrential rainfall up to 26.3in (668mm) created mudslides and landslides that {{damaged or destroyed}} numerous structures, bridges, and vehicles. Most of the island's plantain and banana crops were destroyed. Up to 14 people were killed. <b>Farther</b> <b>west</b> in Curaçao, Tomas led to the most prolific rain event in four decades. An elderly man was killed after suffering {{a heart attack and}} drowning in his flooded vehicle, while a rescue worker died after a hospital wall collapsed. In Haiti, already ravaged by a catastrophic 7.0 MW earthquake less than a year prior, heavy rainfall flooded a refugee camp and triggered mudslides that destroyed homes and roads. Up to 35 people were killed there, though it was feared many more could die as Tomas exacerbated an already-deadly cholera outbreak.|$|E
50|$|This is an {{isolated}} formation, making it {{relatively easy to}} find. The nearest craters of note are Gerard, <b>farther</b> to the <b>west,</b> and von Braun to the west-southwest. To the northeast of Harding is the smaller crater Dechen.|$|R
50|$|Visitors to {{the farm}} included: the Muir family, Captain Grant, the Langford's and their daughters, Dr. Helmcken, Governor Douglas and his family. The Muir family homestead, Woodside Farm, was <b>farther</b> to the <b>west,</b> in Sooke (then spelled “Soke”).|$|R
50|$|Vernadskiy is a lunar crater on the {{far side}} of the Moon, behind the visible eastern limb. It lies to the west-northwest of the smaller crater Siedentopf. To the south is Gavrilov, and much <b>farther</b> to the <b>west</b> is Meggers.|$|R
5|$|The Paul A. M. Dirac Science Library is {{the main}} science library for Florida State University and houses over 500,000 books. Located on FSU's Legacy Walk <b>farther</b> <b>west</b> on campus, Dirac Library is smaller than Strozier at three stories. Dirac offers nearly 800 seats and {{provides}} 80 desktop computers (PC and Mac) and 80 laptop computers(PC and Mac) for use by students. Dirac also offers 8 wireless Air Media Displays and 2 innovative MondoPad displays. There are over 35 individual and group study rooms that can be reserved online. The library building {{is also home to}} the FSU School of Computational Science and Information Technology. The library also houses a collection of materials principally related to Dirac's times at FSU and Cambridge University. Dirac has been renovated in 2015 with new and improved amenities, technology, and seating.|$|E
5|$|The {{manipulation}} {{of time at}} higher latitudes (for example Iceland, Nunavut or Alaska) has little impact on daily life, because the length of day and night changes more extremely throughout the seasons (in comparison to other latitudes), and thus sunrise and sunset times are significantly out of phase with standard working hours regardless of manipulations of the clock. DST is also of little use for locations near the equator, because these regions see only a small variation in daylight {{in the course of}} the year. The effect also varies according to how far east or west the location is within its time zone, with locations farther east inside the time zone benefiting more from DST than locations <b>farther</b> <b>west</b> in the same time zone.|$|E
5|$|As Felice {{neared the}} coast, gale {{warnings}} were hoisted from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Galveston, while a hurricane watch extended from Morgan City to Port O'Connor, Texas. Small craft advisories were also posted, cautioning light vessels {{to remain in}} port. All coastal advisories were discontinued by {{the early hours of}} September 16. Residents {{in the path of the}} storm generally evacuated in a timely manner. Over 3,000 fled the storm in Cameron Parish, Louisiana; around half of the residents in the low-lying southern part of the parish had already left before the mandatory evacuation was ordered. <b>Farther</b> <b>west,</b> one of two evacuation routes out of Sabine Pass, Texas had been rendered unusable a few days before the storm when a bridge was damaged in a maritime accident. As the remaining highway was considered susceptible to coastal flooding, officials quickly worked to evacuate 1,300 people in Sabine Pass before the storm's approach. The American Red Cross converted nine public schools into temporary storm shelters in and around Beaumont. Shelters were also set up in Houston and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, though they went mostly unused. The post offices in Sabine Pass, Gilchrist, and Port Bolivar transferred money orders, first-class parcels and postage stamps to the Beaumont office as a safety precaution.|$|E
50|$|Taylor Slough, {{located in}} the southeastern corner of the Florida Everglades, along with the much larger Shark River Slough <b>farther</b> to the <b>west,</b> are the {{principal}} natural drainages for the freshwater Everglades and the essential conduit for providing overland freshwater to Florida Bay.|$|R
50|$|Pawsey is a worn {{impact crater}} that lies {{next to the}} {{northern}} outer s of the crater Wiener, {{on the far side}} of the Moon. To the east-northeast of Pawsey is the large crater Campbell, and <b>farther</b> to the <b>west</b> is Bridgman.|$|R
50|$|When U.S. Route 101 was built, {{on a new}} {{alignment}} {{crossing the}} river <b>farther</b> to the <b>west,</b> most of the traffic formerly carried by the memorial bridge was diverted. The original bridge design included decorative lights, which were removed in the 1950s.|$|R
5|$|By {{the time}} it went into battle at Lepel on 6 July, the corps was at two-thirds of its {{strength}} due to breakdowns. The corps also attacked without air support and with a shortage of anti-aircraft guns, fuel, and ammunition. Alekseyenko deployed the corps in two echelons: the 13th and 17th Tank Divisions attacked first, with the 109th Motorised Division in the second echelon. The 17th Tank Division ran into the 17th Panzer Division at Senno on 6 July {{at the beginning of}} the counterattack. The 13th Tank Division was attacked on its left flank by the 18th Panzer Division after advancing <b>farther</b> <b>west</b> than the 17th Tank Division. By 10 July the corps had been mostly destroyed. In the Orsha area the retreating corps was given replacement tanks and ordered to resume the attack the next day. The corps counterattacked toward Vitebsk from the south in conjunction with the 7th Mechanised Corps. Running into the 7th and 12th Panzer Divisions, the combined losses of both corps totalled 100 tanks.|$|E
5|$|Danielle {{levelled}} off {{somewhat in}} intensity after that round of rapid intensification, only gradually strengthening afterward due to structural {{changes in the}} storm related to the small wind field relative {{to the size of}} the eye. Nonetheless, Danielle became a Category2 hurricane on the afternoon of August 15 as it approached the subtropical ridge which blocked the continued westward movement. Beginning late on August 15, at about 35°W, Danielle began to recurve to the northwest and eventually north while continuing to gradually strengthen. Early on August 16, the recurvature became more pronounced, and Danielle turned abruptly northward in the central Atlantic Ocean as an upper-level trough opened up a large break in the ridge. That movement took it along the eastern side of the subtropical ridge, preventing Danielle from moving any <b>farther</b> <b>west</b> and becoming any threat to North America or the Caribbean. While moving northwest, Danielle strengthened a bit more, reaching its peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h), just under Category3 intensity, on the afternoon of August 16.|$|E
25|$|From 1820 to 1850, the Greek Revival style {{dominated}} the United States, {{such as the}} Benjamin F. Clough House in Waltham, Massachusetts. It could also be found as far west as Springfield, Illinois. Examples of vernacular Greek Revival continued to be built even <b>farther</b> <b>west,</b> such as in Charles City, Iowa.|$|E
50|$|The Scythians - the Greeks' {{name for}} this {{initially}} nomadic people - inhabited Scythia from at least the 11th century BC to the 2nd century AD. Its location and extent varied over time but usually extended <b>farther</b> to the <b>west</b> than is indicated on the map opposite.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Farther</b> to the <b>west,</b> in the Purchase area, pit {{barbecue}} {{is primarily}} pork shoulder, with the unmodified word [...] "barbecue" [...] referring specifically to that meat.
