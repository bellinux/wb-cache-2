25|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>white</b> wines. <b>Dry</b> <b>white</b> {{wines are}} made {{throughout}} the region, using the regional appellation Bordeaux Blanc, often from 100% Sauvignon blanc or a blend dominated by Sauvignon blanc and Sémillon. The Bordeaux Blanc AOC {{is used for}} wines made in appellations that only allow red wines. Dry whites from Graves are the most well-known {{and it is the}} only subregion with a classification for <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> wines. The better versions tend to have a significant oak influence. In 2007, 7.8% of the region's vineyard surface was used for wines in this family.|$|E

25|$|Many wine-producing {{countries}} produce white wine, {{however the}} white grape needs less heat than red grapes to ripen: {{the lack of}} maturity of tannins {{is not a problem}} since they are not extracted in pressing. In addition the taste balance is based on a significant liveliness due to the acidity. The grapes for the production of <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> wine are harvested just before ripening. These production conditions can result in a more northerly or mountainous location for the vineyard producing <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> wines.|$|E

25|$|Overall, {{more or less}} <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> {{wines are}} most common among the {{sparkling}} wines, but sparkling rosé and red wines are also produced, as well as wines of varying sweetness.|$|E
25|$|Würzburg is {{also the}} capital of the German wine region Franconia which is famous for its mineralic <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> wines {{especially}} from the Silvaner grape. Würzburger Hofbräu brewery also locally produces a well-known pilsner beer.|$|E
25|$|The acidity of <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> wine {{is reduced}} by {{slightly}} salty or sweet dishes while the wine accentuates the salty side of food and tempers heavy fatty foods. Sweet wine goes well with sweet and savoury dishes to mitigate the heavy sugar and stimulate the fruitiness.|$|E

50|$|Red Béarn wines {{clear the}} nose with notes of dark berry fruits (blueberry, cherry and blackcurrant). They should be drunk {{between two and}} five years after bottling. These reds are {{traditionally}} served with grilled or stewed meat, poultry, duck, game, and croûte fleurie cheeses (cheeses with a white or golden mould). Béarn rosés have an aroma of small red fruits and should be drunk young. They are traditionally served with charcuterie, mixed salads and grills. Moelleux and <b>dry</b> <b>whites</b> production is less mainstream. The Moelleux complements foie gras, herby cream cheeses and desserts. The <b>dry</b> <b>whites</b> can be drunk as an aperitif or with hors d'oeuvres, fish, and shellfish, and should be served at 8-10°C.|$|R

25|$|Part of European {{trade was}} by sea along the Atlantic coast. The English, then the Dutch and Scandinavians from their demand for wine, created a craze for {{planting}} between Bordeaux and La Rochelle. Little <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> wine was produced for export from La Rochelle while Bordeaux exported mainly wines from the hinterland received via the Garonne. When wine production was introduced {{on the banks}} of the Charente in the 17th century, Charente white wines were introduced as cognac. At the same time, the <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> wine popular with the Dutch was produced to the north, around the port of Nantes from the current areas of Muscadet AOC and Gros-plant AOVDQS in the Loire Valley. Vineyards in the Loire Valley and the South-west had their sales network thanks to the navigability of the Loire and the Garonne.|$|E
25|$|The vins mutés secs or dry {{fortified}} {{wines are}} dry wines (without sugar) whose fermentation was completed. A quantity of alcohol {{is added to}} increase their alcohol content. They age {{for a long time}} giving wines with the ability to be kept for a very long time. These wines are the sherries and some <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> ports.|$|E

25|$|It {{is similar}} to L. vietus, the grey milk cap, but is {{differentiated}} by the fact L. vietus milk dries grey, while L. glyciosmus milk <b>dries</b> <b>white.</b> It can also be confused with L. cocosiolens, which also smells of coconuts, but L. cocosiolens has a slimy brown or orange cap and is not found among birch.|$|R
25|$|The <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> wine is a wine without sugar (the sugar {{ratio is}} {{generally}} less than 4 grams per litre). It is a wine {{very difficult to}} develop because {{the balance of the}} wine is based on only two parameters: acidity and alcohol. This is the wine that the consumer refers to when he speaks of white wine without giving further details.|$|E
25|$|Entre-deux-mers (literally, {{between two}} seas) is a <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> wine made in Bordeaux. The {{appellation}} {{is one of}} the largest in the Bordeaux region and is situated between the Garonne and the Dordogne (which are actually considered inland seas). The area is responsible for three quarters of the red wine sold under the generic Bordeaux AOC or Bordeaux supérieur labels.|$|E
25|$|Traditional hand {{harvesting}} {{of whole}} bunches has been increasingly {{challenged by the}} harvesting machine for <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> wines, an economic choice but not always a qualitative one. The fragility of the grape requires either a rapid transfer to the Winery, or protection from oxidation. When the transport time between vine and winery is long, the harvest can be refrigerated and kept away from oxygen using nitrogen or dry ice.|$|E

25|$|The maximum {{allowable}} doses {{depend on the}} sugar content of the wine: the residual sugar is susceptible to attack by microorganisms which would cause a restart of fermentation. In France the dose is limited to 150mg/litre for Vin de Pays (country wines), 185mg/l for Sparkling wines, 200mg/l for Fortified wines, 200mg/l for <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> wines, 250mg/l for white wines with residual sugar greater than 5g/litre (Moelleux wines), and 300mg/l for liquoreux sweet wines.|$|E

25|$|Fermentation starts spontaneously {{under the}} action of the natural yeasts from the grapes. The {{winemaker}} can choose to use a commercially available active dry yeast. It can help to express the characteristics of a variety or a method of manufacture. For a <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> wine fermentation continues until the sugar runs out. The wine is then usually decanted to eliminate the lees. When fermentation is done in barrels the temperature often exceeds 20°C or even 25°C.|$|E
25|$|The Tarragona DO is the Catalan wine region {{around the}} coastal city of Tarragona {{and has been}} a vital {{winemaking}} center of Catalan wines since the Roman times. For most of its history the region was known for its sweet fortified red wines made in a style similar to Port. In the 1960s, prior to winning DO status in 1976, the area began to shift its focus to <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> wines and the production of red sacramental wine used by the Christian Church for Communion.|$|E

In cheese fondue the liveliness of <b>dry</b> <b>white</b> wine is balanced with the fat of the cheese. The freshness of the wine as a table drink contrasts the heat of the fondue.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{distribution}} of enterococci in various <b>dried</b> egg <b>white</b> products was surveyed, and some behaviors of enterococci, detected from the <b>dried</b> egg <b>whites,</b> {{in the manufacturing}} process of <b>dried</b> egg <b>white</b> were studied. From some of <b>dried</b> egg <b>white</b> samples, enterococci including Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecalis var. liquefaciens, and S. faecium were identified, but S. durans was not detected. These three spp. of enterococcus did not grow in yolk-free egg white, but grew well in egg white containing small quantities of egg yolk. These enterococci hardly decreased by the pasteurization in various conditions including Cunningham and Lineweaver's method. In the desugaring process by glucose oxidase method these enterococci perished, but in yeast or bacteria fermentation of yolk-free egg white, the counts of these enterococci hardly changed. Small counts of presumable enterococci perished in the spontaneous fermentation of yolk-free egg white, but increased rapidly in the fermentation of the egg white containing 0. 15 % yolk. These enterococci decreased considerably by spray <b>drying</b> egg <b>white,</b> but hardly changed by pan drying. In the heat treatments of dried powder at 57 ° C. and of dried crystal at 50 ° C, many days were needed {{for the destruction of}} these enterococci...|$|R
