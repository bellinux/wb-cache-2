25|$|<b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>himself</b> why {{was there}} such a drastic {{discrepancy}} between the Buddhist doctrines that he read about in books and {{the actual practice of}} Buddhism in real life. He yearned to dedicate his whole life to unraveling this mystery. His mind was set on finding places where Buddhism was still practiced the way it should be. It was at this point where he decided to become a monastic.|$|E
25|$|Socrates then {{sought to}} solve the divine paradox — that an ignorant man also could be the wisest of all men — in effort to {{illuminate}} {{the meaning of the}} Oracles' categorical statement: that he is the wisest man in the land. After systematically interrogating the politicians, the poets, and the craftsmen, Socrates determined that the politicians were impostors; that the poets did not understand their own poetry; and that the craftsmen, like prophets and seers, did not understand the things they spoke. In that light, Socrates saw himself as spokesman for the Oracle at Delphi (22e). <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>himself</b> if he would rather be an impostor, like the “wise people” he interrogated, or if he would rather be himself, Socrates of Athens. As the defendant under trial, Socrates tells the jury that he would rather be himself than be anyone else. That in searching for a man wiser than himself, his questioning earned him the dubious reputation of social gadfly to the city of Athens.|$|E

2500|$|In 1951, Jones began {{attending}} {{gatherings of}} the Communist Party USA in Indianapolis. He became flustered with harassment he received during the McCarthy Hearings, particularly regarding an event he attended {{with his mother}} focusing on Paul Robeson, after which she was harassed by the FBI {{in front of her}} co-workers for attending.

For writers, the [...] "depth , {{and the quality of}} the people writing for it, has made a Review byline a résumé definer. If one wishes to be thought of as a certain type of writer – of heft, style and a certain gravitas – a Review byline is pretty much the gold standard." [...] In editing a piece, Silvers said that <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>himself</b> [...] "if [...] be clearer, while also respecting the writer’s voice and tone. You have to listen carefully to the tone of the writer’s prose and try to adapt to it, but only up to a point. ... Writers deserve the final word about their prose." ...|$|E
