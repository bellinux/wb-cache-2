Throughout the paper, I try to force readers to think critically about these events, rather than consume them through short headlines on the evening news. I learned that there is major potential for diplomatic alternatives to armed conflict in this relationship. I also learned that the current foreign policy strategies both countries are engaging in do not serve their best interests, or help to achieve foreign policy goals.

40|$|To {{increase}} {{the quality and}} the cost-efficiency of contract archaeology in Sweden a revised regulation for contract archaeology was established the 1 st of January 2008. By including find strategy as a concept with special demands in the regulation the Swedish Heritage Board is now hoping that the conservators will be integrated earlier in the archaeological process and that the unpremeditated find accumulations will stop. This is making the competition between the archaeological companies even harder. The questions are how the regulation have affected {{the role of the}} conservators in the field of contract archaeology today, what is affecting the integration and the situation, and what can the different stakeholders do to make the collaboration between archaeologists and conservators more professional? The conservators are now hoping that this is the change that will {{increase the}} collaboration with the archaeologists, which is important for the finds prosperity and the drive of information. To get an updated and generalised view {{of the impact of the}} regulation so far, phone conversations and questionnaires were carried out with archaeologists, conservators, employees at county administrative boards and the Swedish Heritage Board. The answers revealed a generally positive attitude amongst the archaeologists about the conservators’ integration in the archaeological field. It also revealed that most of the archaeologists already are satisfied with the contact they have with the conservators today, while the answers from the conservators proved the opposite. It is still very rare that conservators are part of the practical fieldwork, where the most crucial stage for the finds takes place. The contact is still not constant and the understanding of what the conservators can do is not obvious, and therefore the lack of demand for more contact and practical help. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> are getting closer to the goal, but the communication to a better understanding is still missing and collaboration is scarce.

40|$|The {{first half}} of this thesis is a survey of the PSR, {{followed}} by consideration of arguments for and against the principle. This survey spans from the Ancient Greeks to the present day, and gives the reader a sense {{of the ways in which}} the PSR has been used both implicitly and explicitly throughout the history of philosophy. I argue that, while none of the arguments either for or against the PSR provide conclusive evidence of its truth or falsity, we should adopt a presumption in its favour. The best hope the PSR sceptic has of demonstrating the PSR’s falsity would be to find empirical evidence of something non-deterministic, since the PSR entails determinism. The theory of libertarianism is considered as just such a counterexample; but I argue the evidence for libertarianism is flimsy, and so the presumption in favour of the PSR remains. The second half starts from the premise that the PSR—and hence also determinism—is true, and goes on to examine what implications this has for our moral responsibility practices. We examine incompatibilist arguments by van Inwagen and Galen Strawson, both of which appeal to the origination condition. I contend that these arguments are compelling precisely because the origination condition to which they appeal is compelling. This leaves us with a dilemma: <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> can either accept these incompatibilist arguments, which would require us to abandon our moral responsibility practices; or we could save our moral responsibility practices by adopting some form of compatibilism, but at the cost of denying the intuitively appealing origination condition. In fact, to avoid the costs of each horn of this dilemma, we can seek to create a ‘mixed view’ instead. We consider Vargas’s revisionism, Double’s free will subjectivism, and Smilansky’s illusionism and fundamental dualism, which help to shape the mixed view I argue for here: a consequentialist compatibilist theory of moral responsibility. This theory allows us to acknowledge the impossibility of true desert without dispensing with our responsibility practices...|$|E
40|$|<b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> are now rapidly {{leaving the}} galaxy of printed matter. As screen-based media {{is making its}} entry into our {{everyday}} lives, it is pushing aside an object – the book - that has structured our forms of being together for almost six hundred years. This shift is not absolute but successive, and it raises a lot of questions. What kind of mediating practices are developing beyond printed media? And how do these practices structure and organize common spaces and publicities? Even though today, we are far into the electronic age, {{in a way we}} are still suspended in between modern individualized life and new, more floating societal formations. Therefore, rather than presupposing the disappearance of the book, this paper approaches the idea of the book as an expanded and inter-medial “boundary object” (Star and Griesemer 1989). In this respect, the point of departure is the expanded book project Roma Europa Fake Factory (REFF) (Henderson et. al. 2010) – a platform for global discussion and exchange concerning the management and governance of new public spheres in the electronic age. Playing out the visual authority of the printed text against the flickering of the net through the use of inter-mediating QR codes (Quick Response Codes) and fiducial markers, the project constituted a critical and artefactual intervention, remixing and mashing up the forcible means of the printed word with the intermediary potentials of electronic circuits. In the paper, we discuss the project through one of the contributions – Blind Points of Transition – a combined text- and video-based dialogue; on the one hand an exploration of the book and the net as different locations, {{and on the other hand}} a tentative mapping of the intermediary territory between two geographically separate places. Focusing on the transition of text through different media, the paper critically examines the spatial expansion and modifications of the book as it enters electronic circuits, thus proposing a ‘blind and fake’, or in other words a questioning form of boundary modification; dislocating the critical focus from visuality to agency and from permanent property to intermediary production...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an attempt to {{understand}} the essential properties of concrete objects. The underlying motivation of this investigation is the hope that by understanding essential properties we will be {{in a better position to}} construct a satisfactory metaphysical account of the things that populate the world around us. The initial chapter introduces two questions that this thesis will attempt to answer. The first, ‘what are essential properties?’ is the Analysis Question. Answering it occupies chapters two through five. The second, ‘what essential properties are there?’ is the Extension Question. This is dealt with in the final three chapters. Chapter two provides the beginnings of an answer to the Analysis question, introducing the modal analysis of essential properties. Eight ways modality and essentiality might be related are raised. Of these, two entail the modal analysis. By eliminating the undesirable six, justification for the modal analysis could be provide. In the remainder of the chapter, five of the six are quickly dismissed. Chapter three is an examination of Fundamentalism. Focusing upon the views of E. J. Lowe and Kit Fine, I argue that there are modal facts which cannot be grounded upon essence facts and that certain modal concepts are employed in the construction of the Fundamentalist account. Consequently, Fundamentalism cannot succeed in grounding modality, and therefore cannot be the correct way to understand essentiality. This concludes the argument by elimination, thereby justifying accepting the modal analysis. Chapter four explores the modal analysis. After distinguishing between various formulations, it is argued that an existence-dependent version of the modal analysis is best. An objection by McLeod concerning contingent existence and essential properties is then dealt with, setting the stage for a more troubling objection from Kit Fine. Fine argues that all forms of the modal analysis ‘get the essential properties wrong’, relying upon a series of example properties, including the relation between Socrates and {Socrates}. After breaking down Fine’s argument, the remainder of the chapter concerns examining and dismissing several bad responses to Fine’s argument, including attempts by Della Rocca and Gorman. In chapter five I advance a new response to Fine which centres upon appealing to the sparse/abundant property distinction. Incorporating this distinction into the modal criteria, I demonstrate that a form of the modal analysis can avoid Fine’s attack. I then conclude that this suitably modified modal analysis is an excellent answer to the Analysis Question. The remaining three chapters are part of an attempt to answer the Extension Question. Chapter six critically examines Wiggins’ sortal essentialism, the position that objects are essentially instances of their sorts. After rendering Wiggins’ essentialist argument, I demonstrate that it is either inconclusive or question begging. As such, there is no reason to accept sortal essentialism. Chapter seven looks at the Byzantine arguments concerning origin essentialism. It is shown that these arguments are either inconclusive - in that they do not entail origin essentialism - or assume origin essentialism at the out-set, leaving us little reason to accept origin essentialism. Chapter eight examines Mackie’s minimalist essentialism. After laying out the position, I then examine a series of objections it faces. In particular, I show that even if we accept minimalist essentialism, it would not help us answer the Extension Question. As such, we have no reason to do so. I conclude that essential properties can best be understood as those sparse properties of an object which satisfy a specific modal criterion, as demonstrated in chapter five. However, the number of properties that satisfy this criterion might be quite small, as indicated by the results of chapters six through eight. This result is a mixed one for the essentialist: while we now know what essential properties are, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> lost them all somewhere along the way...|$|E

40|$|Comments on Tim Lyons: Exploring the Prospects for a Purely Axiological Realism Midwest Workshop in Philosophy of Science and Philosophy of Mathematics April 15 - 16, 2011 Department of Philosophy Indiana-Purdue University Fort Wayne LA 35 A Let {{me first}} see if I can {{summarize}} Tim’s view (some of {{this comes from}} his 2005 Toward a Purely Axiological Scientific Realism) : None of the various epistemic realist claims about what we are justified in believing about successful scientific theories work due {{to the presence of}} historical counterexamples. But if so we lack reason to believe the corresponding descriptive semantic claims about what is true about successful theories as well as their corresponding descriptive syntactic claims about what successor theories retain from their predecessors. But {{this does not mean that}} we should reject axiological realism, roughly the view that science aims at truth, because one can be justified in having an aim even if one is never justified in believing that one has attained it. But this is possible only if we can identify certain necessary conditions for the attainment of progress towards our ideal aim, some of which also have value in themselves that can account for the utility of the pursuit of a utopian aim, one we can never know we’ve attained. But given all this the aim of science must be some subset of truth for which such necessary conditions (some with intrinsic value) can be specified and towards which it can plausibly be maintained science has been endeavoring in its history. The subset of truth towards which science aims (and has presumably been aiming) is the increase of experientially concretized (XT) truths in theory-complexes. Theory-complexes are sets of theories + auxiliaries needed to generate predictions, tests and reports from them. XT truths are true statements that enter into reports of specific experiences or in tested statements about the world of experience. Specifically, they are not truths that are detached from the complex or conjoined in such a way that they are vacuous and can make no difference to the world of experience. Axiological realism thus appropriately modified becomes independent of the debate over epistemic realism; its justification lies elsewhere (in 4 above.) But the debate concerning epistemic realism has led to a succession of descriptive content-retention hypotheses that can in principle be ranked according to the quantity of historical counter-examples. This is useful because it provides evidence for a descriptive view about the nature of scientific inquiry (also independent of the epistemic issues from which it arose) according to which theory change has been historically governed by the application of not one but a prioritized distribution of content-retention hypotheses (e. g., retain the predecessor’s classification of phenomena, mathematical structure, manipulated posited entities, deployed constituents, non-deployed constituents, etc.) And this prioritized list of content-retention hypotheses can be combined with a prioritized list of theoretical virtues that are necessary conditions for achievement on IncXT (e. g. an increase in empirical accuracy and consistency, an increase in or retention of BOS, TST, SIMP, etc.) The result is a descriptive view of the nature of scientific inquiry with the following characteristics It is grounded in axiological rather than epistemic realism It emphasizes flexibility in theorizing It combines content-retention principles with non-empirical theoretical virtue principles. From it inference to the best explanation follows. It is testable. It responds to the historical challenge to realism as a modus tollens rather than as a pessimistic induction. Can you be more specific about the connection between your content-retention and theoretical virtue priorities and the nature of inference to the best explanation? How is it that IBE follows from these? Are you saying that your view provides a better grounding of IBE as a mode of inductive inference or gives it more substance (a clearer understanding of what is better and why it is better?) What’s the nature of the modus tollens you refer to? You say that it falsifies the Type-D semantic meta-hypothesis “Successful theories are approximately true”. So is this it? “If successful theories are approximately true then successful theories a, b, c …n should be approximately true. But its not the case that successful theories a, b, c … n are approximately true, so its not the case that successful theories are approximately true. ” But reading “all” as the quantifier this just leads to “Some successful theories are not approximately true” which needn’t trouble the realist much if most of them are. So why can’t the type-D meta-hypothesis still be probably correct? In which case we are back to the pessimistic induction argument it seems. In a similar vein, what’s the argument that the epistemic realist needs to defend a universal type-D content retention meta-hypothesis, one that works in all cases? Only, it seems to me, if she says that being approximately true is the only explanation of theoretical success. But why must she say this? In any case, trying to support a probabilistic content-retention meta-hypothesis would seem to be an alternative to a methodology involving a hierarchical ranking of such hypothesis. Tim talks about Type-E meta-hypotheses (about what we are justified in believing) that correspond with Type-D semantic meta-hypotheses (about what is true) that in turn correspond with Type-D syntactic content retention meta-hypotheses (about which sentences/categories/referential expression of predecessor theories can be retained by successors) but why no mention of Type-D metaphysical meta-hypotheses (about the existence of the unobservables that successful scientific theories commit to, about what is “out there”) ? Following Devitt, why not say that at the center of the realist debate is the metaphysical question, and that sematic and epistemic (and axiological?) issues are parasitic on the metaphysical issue? In any case, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> could (should?) at least recognize a similar variety of Type-D metaphysical meta-hypotheses corresponding to the various epistemic, semantic, and syntactic ones, making for three descriptive levels. And if so, following the logic of this paper, perhaps we could take the results of the epistemic debate all the way down (or up) to the metaphysical level, with a hierarchical prioritized list of metaphysical hypotheses. If we can’t ever know if we have attained or are approaching our aim, and have to rely on the utility argument to ground scientific methodology or inquiry, how is this different from saying that the real aim of science is just the attainment of those necessary conditions of IncXT that have value in themselves? And does e. g. empirical accuracy and BOS really have this sort of value...|$|E

To my thesis committee, chaired by Dr. Julie Pfeiffer and including Drs. Beth Levine, Jerry Niederkorn, and Sally Ward, thank you for your guidance throughout this journey. To Dr. Allison Case, even in those moments when <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> were living in the best of all possible worlds, you helped me keep going, and for that I am grateful. I am also indebted to the remaining members of Team Peptoid, both current and former, from the Cancer Immunobiology Center (CIC) at UT Southwestern, whose labor, insight, and genera...|$|R
5000|$|The drums are a {{combination}} of both live and sampled drums. The band sampled drummer Dana Burnell performing live drums into a synclavier without any cymbals, and then re-recorded the cymbals live later in order to have complete separation of drums and cymbals. Guitarist Jon Drenning stated [...] "It was a very arduous and time consuming way to do it but at the time <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> something <b>we</b> wanted to try to achieve; a pristine, clean sound and true separation of all instruments." ...|$|R
5000|$|All {{the tracks}} were created {{with the club}} in mind, in {{contrast}} to the experimental style found on Whorl. Ford explained the concept and title in a statement: [...] "We realize that from an outsider point of view, <b>it</b> can <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> change quite radically with every album we do but {{from our point of view}} it always feels like a smooth transition. Hopefully people who have stuck with us this long, and appreciate the fact that we aren’t trying to repeat ourselves with every album, will enjoy another slight turn sideways." ...|$|R

That {{sums up the}} greatness of this team. Madrid is God's team and the team of the world." [...] -Sergio Ramos branded Real Madrid as the “God’s team” after he was questioned over Pope Francis’ adherence to 2014 FIFA Club World Cup Final opponents San Lorenzo. On 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal. A day later, he was introduced at his first press conference for Madrid where {{it was announced that}} both Zinedine Zidane and Paul Clement will be his assistants. On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer from Tottenham of Gareth Bale was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly the new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at €100 million. In Ancelotti's first season at the club, Real Madrid won the Copa del Rey, with Bale scoring the winner in the final against Barcelona. On 24 May, Real Madrid defeated city rivals Atlético Madrid in the 2014 Champions League Final, winning their first European title since 2002, and becoming the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as [...] "La Décima".|$|R

NTSB investigator Carolyn Deforge, who had overseen the investigation of NW85, said in the television program Mayday (Air Crash Investigation, Air Emergency) [...] "it {{appeared to be a}} very dramatic event, and ... <b>it</b> definitively <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> something <b>we</b> needed to follow up on, trying to understand what had happened." ...|$|R
500|$|Feige {{stated that}} Steve Rogers would be paired with other {{characters}} from The Avengers like Black Widow and Nick Fury, because unlike Tony Stark and Thor, who {{could return to}} their own supporting casts, Rogers had nowhere else to go, [...] "and it just made sense {{that he was the}} one that stayed with what remains of the Avengers at the end of the film." [...] The writers considered including Hawkeye, but [...] "he didn't have enough to do and suddenly <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> were giving him short shrift", leading all of his parts to be fulfilled by Black Widow, and Joe Russo added that Jeremy Renner's schedule could not be worked out for him to appear. As to why the Red Skull from The First Avenger did not appear in The Winter Soldier, Joe Russo explained, [...] "I know we have a guy in a computer, but the tone we were chasing was sort of that conspiracy thriller. And we wanted to try and ground the movie as much as we could. And Red Skull, he's a fantastical character and didn't necessarily fit for Cap 2 and especially because it was about the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. Certainly Hydra exists and that's his legacy, but there's something interesting about the fact that his legacy outlived the skull. And they're still dealing with the demons of it, but not necessarily him." ...|$|R
