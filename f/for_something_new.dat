500|$|In Shakespeare's day, the Queen of England {{had her own}} Master of Revels—appointed {{to oversee}} all {{entertainment}} in London. Before a play could be performed, its script {{had to go through}} him, and whenever the Queen wanted to see a play, he would make recommendations. By 1581 (over a decade before the writing of Dream), all plays had to be approved by the Master of Revels prior to being performed. Shakespeare seems to be poking fun at the profession through Philostrate. At one point, when Theseus asks Philostrate to recommend a play to help pass the time, he lists several which sound ridiculous, such as [...] "the battle with the centaurs to be sung by an Athenian eunuch to the harp." [...] These names are humorous examples of the types of plays that were actually being performed around the time of Dream. They were becoming old however, and, like Theseus, monarchs were searching <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>new,</b> refreshing, and sophisticated.|$|E
500|$|The {{second book}} {{to use the}} name Unearthed Arcana was written by Andy Collins, Jesse Decker, David Noonan, and Rich Redman, and {{published}} in February 2004 by Wizards of the Coast, for use with the Dungeons & Dragons third edition rules. Cover art was by Matt Cavotta, with interior art by Steven Belledin, Ed Cox, Wayne England, Emily Fiegenschuh, David Hudnut, Jeremy Jarvis, Doug Kovacs, John and Laura Lakey, David Martin, Dennis Crabapple McClain, Mark Nelson, James Pavelec, Steve Prescott, David Roach, Richard Sardinha, Ron Spencer, Stephen Tappin, Joel Thomas, and Ben Thompson. The designers aimed the book at experienced players and DMs looking <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>new,</b> encouraging them to customize the game's rules. The designers {{did not want the}} third edition book to be like the original Unearthed Arcana mechanically, because according to Andy Collins: [...] "Every book on the market looks like the original Unearthed Arcana. New classes, new spells, new magic items - that's the default [...] "recipe" [...] for a d20 product these days. We saw no need to do that with this book." [...] Where the original Unearthed Arcana had simply expanded the rules and options of the core game, this 224-page supplement was aimed at providing an extensive list of variant rules and options to change the standard game itself. The volume of options added was intentionally excessive; according to the designers, a Dungeon Master who reads the book must be prepared to [...] "Drink from the fire hose" [...] and to think before using options that may radically imbalance the game. [...] The book ends with a checklist of the included variants, preceded by a short chapter discussing ways of transitioning among multiple games using different rulesets (one of which explicitly emulates the [...] "Eternal Champion" [...] stories of Michael Moorcock).|$|E

500|$|Vocally, Benson {{performs}} [...] "Part of Your World" [...] using a whispered, [...] "intense" [...] {{singing voice}} {{as opposed to}} belting, although her performance has also been described as [...] "bigger-than-yourself". Spanning exactly one octave from C4 to C5, the song's limited vocal range allows Benson to effortlessly transition from her speaking to her singing voice, raising and lowering her volume throughout {{in a manner that}} resembles normal speech. In addition to singing using [...] "a light, speech-driven ‘mix’", the singer also incorporates [...] "quirky little comments and girly gestures". According to Screen Rant's Turner Minton, Benson's vocals [...] " [...] a rawness to the song, giving a depth of eagerness to Ariel’s voice that makes for a genuine performance", by delivering a vocal track that is a combination of passion, strength, sincerity, angst, emotion and innocence. Described as [...] "wistful pleas", Bustles Emma Lord observed that Benson sings the song using a combination of [...] "tomboyish-ness and yearning". Meanwhile, the final line of the song's reprise is sung with [...] "a bit more oomph" [...] than the original, declaring [...] "I don't know when, I don't know how/But I know something's starting right now". Musical similarities have been drawn between [...] "Part of Your World" [...] and [...] "Somewhere That's Green" [...] from Ashman and Menken's musical Little Shop of Horrors, specifically {{the way in which the}} lines [...] "part of your world" [...] and [...] "somewhere that’s green" [...] are sung. The song has also been compared to Judy Garland's song [...] "Over the Rainbow" [...] due to their shared themes about [...] "wish <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>new</b> and different."

And we did so through a very necessary yet narrow Jewish nationalism called 'Zionism' that currently appears to have outlived its usefulness. If we define Zionism (as most Israelis do) not as the Jewish struggle for liberation over millennia but as a 20th century national movement that succeeded in returning the Jewish people to nationhood, we are currently living in a post-Zionist reality... Few still approach Zionism as an ideology with any intellectual depth, because the Jewish people are by and large ready and thirsty <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>new.</b> In order to advance to the next stage, however, we need to shift away from our narrow Jewish nationalism in favor of a uniquely Hebrew universalism that reflects and expresses authentic Jewish values while being more inclusive to non-Jewish groups in our society. We need to dig deeper into the wealth of our ancient sources in order to arrive at policies and structures that will at the same time make our country more Jewish, democratic and inclusive of the 'other.' Hebrew universalism {{should not be confused with}} Western universalism but should actually be seen as an alternative to it... Advancing to the next stage of Jewish liberation doesn’t require that we shrink our nationalism or negate its achievements... Our nationalism needs to deepen and expand to the point that it explodes and spills over into universalism, transcending the either/or 'Arab versus Jew' paradigm and making the State of Israel, from river to sea, both the fulfillment of historic Jewish aspirations and a genuine light unto nations that will benefit and inspire all humankind." ...|$|E
