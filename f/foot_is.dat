5|$|The {{middle toe}} of the California condor's <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> greatly elongated, and the hind one is only {{slightly}} developed. The talons of all the toes are straight and blunt, and are thus more adapted to walking than gripping. This is more similar to their supposed relatives the storks than to birds of prey and Old World vultures, which use their feet as weapons or organs of prehension.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{official}} account, Bissonnette's version alleges that bin Laden's wife Mariam was uninjured in the raid. In addition, Bissonnette {{states that the}} report of bin Laden's daughter Safia having splintered wood striking her <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> false, as he explains that it was rather his wife Amal who was injured by such fragments.|$|E
5|$|After he is accosted by Doerachman, Mardjan {{reveals that}} the letter which Doerachman signed was {{actually}} a statement granting Mardjan all of the hadji's wealth. Furious at Mardjan's behaviour, Asmadi attacks him while Rachmat restrains the others. After a lengthy knife fight, Mardjan's <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> caught in the railroad tracks, and he is soon killed by a passing train. Doerachman, pleased {{with the return of}} his wealth, destroys the letter and grants Rachmat permission to marry Atikah.|$|E

50|$|Most {{flexible}} flat <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> asymptomatic, and do {{not cause}} pain. In these cases, there is usually no cause for concern. Flat <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> formerly a physical-health reason for service-rejection in many militaries. However, three military studies on asymptomatic adults (see section below), suggest that persons with asymptomatic flat <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> at least as tolerant of foot stress as the population with various grades of arch. Asymptomatic flat <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> no longer a service disqualification in the U.S. military.|$|R
5|$|Christie (Gary Dourdan), an adept mercenary, is second-in-command of the Betty. After Call is apprehended and {{the crew}} rounded up for execution, Christie uses his hidden pair of pistols to shoot {{them out of their}} situation. When the crew goes underwater, Christie {{harnesses}} Vriess to his back and swims to the opening (which puts them {{in the middle of a}} clutch of Alien eggs). Fleeing from the attacking Aliens, Christie is injured and his <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> snagged by an Alien. He saves Vriess by detaching himself, allowing Christie to fall into the water below, sacrificing himself.|$|E
5|$|On board a Runabout, Odo (René Auberjonois) and Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) are {{in pursuit}} of a Maquis vessel in the Badlands. They pursue the vessel to a small moon and land nearby. They find that the Maquis vessel is empty, and split up to search for the pilot. After a short while, Odo comes across Kira, whose <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> caught in an {{expanding}} crystal mass. Odo is unable to either remove the crystal from Kira, or transport Kira back to the Runabout.|$|E
5|$|The hindfeet {{are long}} and have the three central digits longer than the two outer ones. They are white to pale yellow above, where the <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> covered with hairs, which are longer than in T.bolivaris. The digits of the hindfeet are {{surrounded}} by ungual tufts of silvery hair that are longer than the claws themselves. The claws are short and sharp. Parts of the sole are covered by indistinct scales (squamae), which are usually entirely absent in T.bolivaris. The pads are moderately large.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, many prosodists divide a {{line into}} feet—the minimal {{repeated}} units—using the pipe symbol (|). When <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> thus designated, words that span <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> divided without hyphens, and any punctuation that occurs at a <b>foot</b> break <b>is</b> typically omitted.|$|R
5|$|The {{sea otter}} {{displays}} numerous adaptations to its marine environment. The nostrils and small ears can close. The hind feet, which provide {{most of its}} propulsion in swimming, are long, broadly flattened, and fully webbed. The fifth digit on each hind <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> longest, facilitating swimming while on its back, but making walking difficult. The tail is fairly short, thick, slightly flattened, and muscular. The front paws are short with retractable claws, with tough pads on the palms that enable gripping slippery prey. The bones show osteosclerosis, increasing their density to reduce buoyancy.|$|E
5|$|This wall is {{visited by}} all our {{brothers}} on every feast and festival; {{and the large}} space at its <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> often so densely filled up, that all cannot perform their devotions here at the same time. It is also visited, though by less numbers, on every Friday afternoon, and by some nearly every day. No one is molested in these visits by the Mahomedans, as {{we have a very}} old firman from the Sultan of Constantinople that the approach shall not be denied to us, though the Porte obtains for this privilege a special tax, which is, however, quite insignificant.|$|E
5|$|A hanap of gold, all {{its cover}} well and richly {{enamelled}} {{on the outside}} with the life of Madame St Agnes; and the cresting of the <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> garnished with 26 pearls, and the crown around the cover with 36 pearls; and the finial of the said cover (is) garnished with four sapphires, three balas rubies and fifteen pearls. And it weighs 9 marcs 3 ounces of gold. and the said hanap rests on a stand of gold {{in the form of}} a tripod, and in the middle of the tripod is represented Our Lady in a sun on a ground of clear red, and the three feet of the tripod are formed by three winged dragons. The said hanap and cover were given to the king by monseigneur the duc de Berry on his journey into Touraine in the year 91.|$|E
25|$|The girl's broken feet {{required}} {{a great deal}} of care and attention, and they would be unbound regularly. Each time the <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> unbound, they were washed, the toes carefully checked for injury, and the nails carefully and meticulously trimmed. When unbound, the broken <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> also kneaded to soften them and the soles of the girl's <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> often beaten to make the joints and broken bones more flexible. The <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> also soaked in a concoction that caused any necrotic flesh to fall off.|$|R
30|$|Phases in {{the gait}} cycle were {{evaluated}} according to duration. The {{duration of the}} right swing phase {{was defined as the}} time when the right <b>foot</b> <b>was</b> off the ground, while the right stance phase was defined as the time when the right <b>foot</b> <b>was</b> on the ground. Similarly, the duration of the left swing phase was defined as the time when the left <b>foot</b> <b>was</b> off the ground, while the left stance phase was the time when the left <b>foot</b> <b>was</b> on the ground. The single support phase was defined as the period of time during which the opposite <b>foot</b> <b>was</b> lifted for swing phase, whilst the double support phase was defined as the period when both <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> in contact with the floor. The gait cycle was defined as the time interval between 2 successive occurrences of 1 repetitive event of walking.|$|R
50|$|What is the due of a {{king who}} is always in {{residence}} {{at the head of}} his tuath? Seven score feet of perfect <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> the measure of his stockade on every side. Seven <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> the thickness of its earthwork, and twelve feet its depth. It is then that he is a king, when ramparts of vassalage surround him. What is the rampart of vassalage? Twelve <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> the breadth of its opening and its depth and its measure towards the stockade. Thirty <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> its measure outwardly.|$|R
5|$|Aberrations in {{the shape}} of {{operculum}} have been observed. In a specimen from Vouvant in France, and another from a spring near Bar in Montenegro, a double rib was present, but the rib shield was reduced; in a specimen from Ohrid Lake, only the rib shield was reduced. Theodoxus fluviatilis can be distinguished from the other three mentioned species by having a rib pit, which is formed by the rib and the rib shield. The rib shield, and consequently a rib pit, are lacking in Theodoxus transversalis, Theodoxus danubialis and Theodoxus prevostianus. These three species differs in having, in addition to a rib, a peg, which is absent in T. fluviatilis. The visible soft parts of the animal are light yellow with a black head. The tentacles are greyish and long. The eyes are large and black; the <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> whitish.|$|E
5|$|Parvati has a well-developed, round bosom and {{a narrow}} {{feminine}} waist embellished with various haras (religious bracelets) and other ornaments, made of diamonds and other gems. She has a fuller thigh and a curvier body and hip than the male {{part of the}} icon. The torso, hip and pelvis of the female is exaggerated to emphasize the anatomical differences between the halves. Though the male private parts may be depicted, the female genitalia are never depicted and the loins are always draped. She wears a multi-coloured or white silken garment down to her ankle and one or three girdles around her waist. The left half wears an anklet and her <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> painted red with henna. The left leg may be somewhat bent or straight, resting on a lotus pedestal. In contrast to the Shiva half, the Parvati half – smeared with saffron – is described as calm and gentle, parrot-green or dark in colour. She may be draped in a sari covering her torso and legs.|$|E
5|$|Rugby Union is {{considered}} the national sport of Madagascar. The national rugby team is nicknamed the Makis after the local word for the indigenous ring-tailed lemur. The team trains and plays domestic matches at Maki Stadium in Antananarivo. Constructed in 2012, the stadium has a capacity of 15,000 and houses a gym and administrative offices for the team. It replaces their former home, Malacam Stadium, which had a capacity of approximately 3,000 that was regularly exceeded {{by the number of}} attendees. Several soccer teams are also based in Antananarivo; AS Adema Analamanga and Ajesaia are associated with the Analamanga region; USCA <b>Foot</b> <b>is</b> associated with the CUA and the AS Saint Michel has been affiliated since 1948 with the historic secondary school of the same name. All four teams train and play local games in Mahamasina Municipal Stadium, the largest sporting venue in the country. The men's basketball teams Challenger and SOE (Équipe du Stade olympique de l'Emyrne) are based in Antananarivo and play in the Palais des Sports at Mahamasina.|$|E

5|$|Some {{conformation}} flaws {{common in}} the breed that may hinder a trotter's success include a heavy forehand and overangulated hind legs. Another problem that affects some Finnhorses {{is a tendency to}} trot with the front and hind legs directly in line with other, which creates a high probability of forging, where the hind hooves hit the front pasterns, which can cause breaking gait. This can be helped to a degree with careful shoeing. There is also a tendency toward ossification of the hoof cartilages of the front feet, which tends to increase with age, and appears to be heritable. This condition, called sidebone when it affects the lateral and medial cartilages of the <b>foot,</b> <b>is</b> common in draught breeds. However, a study of affected Finnhorses also noted that horses with long toes and low heels were common and ossification correlated with the length of the heels.|$|E
5|$|The 160 hidden panels do {{not form}} a {{continuous}} story, but each panel provides one complete illustration {{of cause and}} effect. There are depictions of blameworthy activities, from gossip to murder, with their corresponding punishments. There are also praiseworthy activities, that include charity and pilgrimage to sanctuaries, and their subsequent rewards. The pains of hell and the pleasure of heaven are also illustrated. There are scenes of daily life, complete with the full panorama of samsara (the endless cycle of birth and death). The encasement base of the Borobudur temple was dissembled to reveal the hidden foot, and the reliefs were photographed by Casijan Chepas in 1890. It is these photographs that are displayed in Borobudur Museum (Karmawibhangga Museum), located just several hundred meters north of the temple. During the restoration, the foot encasement was reinstalled, covering the Karmawibhangga reliefs. Today, only {{the southeast corner of}} the hidden <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> revealed and visible for visitors.|$|E
5|$|The base {{color of}} the living animal is very pale subtranslucent yellow. The mantle, kidney, and {{hepatopancreas}} are visible through the shell but are often slightly obscured by {{the thickness of the}} shell. The dorsal surface of the mantle is pale yellow, tinted with olive, often marked with black streaks and blotches. Over the hepatopancreas is a golden yellow tessellation that is marked with gray or black spots and streaks. A dark marking on the posterior surface of the <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> distinctive. However, the mark is not present on the hatchlings, making them impossible to identify in the field. The mark becomes obvious once the snail reaches approximately 6 to 9mm in length.|$|E
50|$|A local stream called Four Mile Run {{defines the}} hill’s {{southern}} and southwestern extent. Mount Daniel (472 <b>feet)</b> <b>is</b> to its west, Mackey’s Hill (171 <b>feet)</b> <b>is</b> to its north, and Upton’s Hill (410 <b>feet)</b> <b>is</b> to its east. Its location overlooks the City of Falls Church {{on the opposite}} side of Four Mile Run, 1.4 miles to its south.|$|R
50|$|In Volume 4 the <b>Foot</b> <b>were</b> given a {{security}} contract by the Utroms for their base because the Utroms have a no weapons {{policy and the}} <b>Foot</b> <b>are</b> skilled at hand-to-hand combat.

5|$|The {{species has}} a large and {{powerful}} foot with brown spots and markings towards the edge, but is white nearer to the visceral hump that stays inside the shell and accommodates internal organs. The base of the anterior end of the foot has a distinct groove, which contains {{the opening of the}} pedal gland. Attached to the posterior end of the foot for about one third of its length is the dark brown, corneous, sickle-shaped operculum, which is reinforced by a distinct central rib. The base of the posterior two-thirds of the animal's <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> rounded; only the anterior third touches the ground during locomotion. The columella, the central pillar within the shell, serves as the attachment point for the white columellar muscle. Contraction of this strong muscle allows the animal's soft parts to shelter in the shell in response to undesirable stimuli.|$|E
5|$|The {{underside}} {{consists of}} a muscular foot, which has adapted to different purposes in different classes. The foot carries a pair of statocysts, which act as balance sensors. In gastropods, it secretes mucus as a lubricant to aid movement. In forms having only a top shell, such as limpets, the foot acts as a sucker attaching the animal to a hard surface, and the vertical muscles clamp the shell down over it; in other molluscs, the vertical muscles pull the foot and other exposed soft parts into the shell. In bivalves, the <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> adapted for burrowing into the sediment; in cephalopods it is used for jet propulsion, and the tentacles and arms are derived from the foot.|$|E
5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle is an {{opportunistic}} carnivore and consumes a {{wide variety}} of animal prey, including carrion. It often catches a fish by flying low over the water and grasping it in its talons. It prepares for the strike by holding its feet far forward (almost under its chin) and then strikes backwards while simultaneously beating its wings to lift upwards. Generally only one <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> used to seize prey. The white-bellied sea eagle may also dive at a 45 degree angle from its perch and briefly submerge to catch fish near the water surface. While hunting over water on sunny days, it often flies directly into the sun or at right angles to it, seemingly to avoid casting shadows over the water and hence alerting potential prey.|$|E
