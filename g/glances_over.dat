500|$|The video {{begins with}} a view of the {{apartment}} that Lewis and Haynes shared. Books and a vase lay strewn across the floor, while Lewis weeps in the corner and Haynes watches from a distance teary-eyed. The video switches to several other shots of Lewis singing the first verse, looking morose. In a third shot, Lewis is seen standing on a rooftop against the Los Angeles skyline dressed in a dark red crop top. Then the video switches to Lewis standing in front of projected images of the memorable times of her relationship with Haynes. Lewis and Haynes are seen sat at opposite ends of the sofa looking into the distance, spliced with more scenes of Lewis on the rooftop. The couple are seen during an awkward dinner before switching to images of the couple in bed together, seemingly happy. As the chorus kicks in for the first time, the couple are seen arriving at a party, with Lewis wearing an aqua-coloured dress with a portion of her midriff revealed, meanwhile Haynes wears a plaid shirt and jeans. Initially the couple are content, embracing guests but socialising separately and avoiding contact with each other. The camera switches between these and the earlier scenes of Lewis in front of projected images and the LA skyline throughout the chorus. As Lewis sings [...] "I'm a whole lot of trouble/ We're in a whole lot of trouble", she <b>glances</b> <b>over</b> to see Haynes flirting with another girl.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the trio}} ships out, Steven {{and his girlfriend}} Angela marry in a Russian Orthodox wedding. Mike works to control his {{feelings}} for Nick's girlfriend Linda. At the wedding reception held at the local VFW hall, the guys drink, dance, sing, and enjoy the festivities, but then notice a soldier in a U.S. Army Special Forces uniform. Mike attempts to ask what Vietnam is like, but the soldier ignores him. After Mike explains that he, Steven, and Nick are going to Vietnam, the Green Beret raises his glass and says [...] "fuck it". After being restrained from starting a fight, Mike {{goes back to the}} bar and raises his glass and toasts him with [...] "fuck it". The soldier <b>glances</b> <b>over</b> at Mike and grins.|$|E
6000|$|Shut that door! [He <b>glances</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder, {{sees his}} mistake.] Beg pardon! [To himself.] Thought 'twas the other fool! ...|$|E
60|$|The {{communication}} was torn open, and Tom <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> it hastily.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Woodridge <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> it, {{and then}} {{surveyed}} her new assistant.|$|R
60|$|Danny ran another {{careless}} and unflattering <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> Rivera and sighed.|$|R
6000|$|... [The paper {{comes to}} TIEFENBACH, who <b>glances</b> <b>over</b> it at [...] {{the same time}} with GOETZ and KOLATTO. MARADAS in [...] the mean time returns to OCTAVIO, all this takes [...] place, the {{conversation}} with BUTLER proceeding [...] uninterrupted.|$|E
60|$|But {{the pretty}} milkmaid {{was much too}} vexed to make any answer. She picked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away, the poor animal limping on three legs. As she left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful <b>glances</b> <b>over</b> her {{shoulder}} at the clumsy strangers, holding her nicked elbow close to her side.|$|E
60|$|As she {{was carried}} {{away for the}} moment by an irresistible train of thought, all {{connected}} with her daughter's future greatness, Sir Mulberry Hawk and his friend exchanged <b>glances</b> <b>over</b> {{the top of the}} bonnet which the poor lady so much regretted not having left at home, and proceeded to dilate with great rapture, but much respect on the manifold perfections of Miss Nickleby.|$|E
60|$|The other <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his easy, mature {{figure and}} strong throat.|$|R
60|$|Lawford shot {{a rather}} doglike <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> his toast. 'Danton?' he said.|$|R
60|$|The maid <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> her {{shoulder}} and went on preparing her mistress's clothes.|$|R
6000|$|Now Jenny was the {{youngest}} of our flock, and therefore, in a certain way, regarded by my wife and me as perennially [...] "the baby;" [...] and these little, old-fashioned, decisive ways of announcing her opinions seemed {{so much a part of}} her nature, so peculiarly [...] "Jennyish," [...] as I used to say, that my wife and I only exchanged amused <b>glances</b> <b>over</b> her head when they occurred.|$|E
60|$|Tom lay {{perfectly}} still, and the Irishman {{continued his}} story. It grew in mystery and {{in horror as}} he proceeded, and his audience became entranced, {{while some of the}} more superstitious among them cast occasional <b>glances</b> <b>over</b> their shoulders into the forest behind, which ere long was steeped in the blackness of an unusually dark night. A few of those outside the circle rose and drew nearer to the story-teller.|$|E
60|$|As the Purser's steward so conspicuously figured at the {{unsuccessful}} {{auction of}} my jacket, {{it reminds me}} of how important a personage that official is on board of all men-of-war. He is the right-hand man and confidential deputy and clerk of the Purser, who intrusts to him all his accounts with the crew, while, in most cases, he himself, snug and comfortable in his state-room, <b>glances</b> <b>over</b> a file of newspapers instead of overhauling his ledgers.|$|E
60|$|He hesitated and flitted {{away with}} a guilty back <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder....|$|R
60|$|In haste and terror, Edith <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> the letter, {{which was}} from her grandmother.|$|R
60|$|My father halted for {{an instant}} in his answer, and <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|BLUNTSCHLI. Yes: I {{shall have}} to start for home in an hour. He has left {{a lot of big}} hotels behind him to be looked after. (Takes up a heavy letter in a long blue envelope.) Here's a whacking letter from the family solicitor. (He pulls out the {{enclosures}} and <b>glances</b> <b>over</b> them.) Great Heavens! Seventy! Two hundred! (In a crescendo of dismay.) Four hundred! Four thousand!! Nine thousand six hundred!!! What on earth shall I do with them all? ...|$|E
60|$|This pleasantry so tickles Mr. Smallweed that he laughs, {{long and}} low, before the fire. But ever while he laughs, he <b>glances</b> <b>over</b> his paralytic {{shoulder}} at Mr. George and eagerly watches {{him as he}} unlocks the padlock of a homely cupboard at the distant end of the gallery, looks here and there upon the higher shelves, and ultimately takes something out with a rustling of paper, folds it, {{and puts it in}} his breast. Then Judy pokes Mr. Smallweed once, and Mr. Smallweed pokes Judy once.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Tulkinghorn <b>glances</b> <b>over</b> his {{spectacles}} {{and begins}} again lower down. My Lady carelessly and scornfully abstracts her attention. Sir Leicester {{in a great}} chair looks at the file and {{appears to have a}} stately liking for the legal repetitions and prolixities as ranging among the national bulwarks. It happens that the fire is hot where my Lady sits and that the hand-screen is more beautiful than useful, being priceless but small. My Lady, changing her position, sees the papers on the table--looks at them nearer--looks at them nearer still--asks impulsively, [...] "Who copied that?" ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} at Razumov, who {{waited for him to}} move on.|$|R
60|$|Mrs Verloc <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> her shoulder. Chief Inspector Heat {{was amazed}} at her coolness.|$|R
60|$|The Prince <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> Lady Grace's mare {{and turned}} aside to join Penelope and Somerfield.|$|R
60|$|At {{this the}} younger lady came {{rustling}} forward, pinching {{in a very}} slender waist, and casting idly preoccupied <b>glances</b> <b>over</b> {{the front of her}} dress, which was apparently designed for a ball. She was, in a singular way, at once ugly and pretty; she had protuberant eyes, and lips strangely red. She reminded Newman of his friend, Mademoiselle Nioche; this was what that much-obstructed young lady would have liked to be. Valentin de Bellegarde walked behind her at a distance, hopping about to keep off the far-spreading train of her dress.|$|E
60|$|The seamen obeyed his orders, {{while the}} {{midshipman}} rejoined his commander, {{who continued to}} pace along the beach, occasionally halting to throw his uneasy <b>glances</b> <b>over</b> the water, and then hurrying onward, {{at a rate that}} caused his youthful companion to exert his greatest power to maintain the post he had taken at his side. Every effort to discover the lost cockswain was, however, after two hours' more search, abandoned as fruitless; and with reason, for the sea was never known to give up the body of the man who might be emphatically called its own dead.|$|E
6000|$|As he {{said this}} he gave involuntarily one of those fearful <b>glances</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder, and shrunk back with more than usual horror. I could not {{resist the temptation to}} allude to this movement, which I {{supposed}} to be some mere malady of the nerves. The moment I mentioned it his face became crimsoned and convulsed--he grasped me by both hands: [...] "For God's sake," [...] exclaimed he, with a piercing agony of voice--"never allude to that again; let us avoid this subject, my friend; you cannot relieve me, indeed you cannot relieve me; but you may add to the torments I suffer;--at some future day you shall know all." ...|$|E
60|$|Anne tore {{open the}} letter and <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> the {{somewhat}} untidy and poorly written contents.|$|R
60|$|Whispering Winds <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> her {{shoulder}} with a startled cry, {{which ended in}} a scream.|$|R
60|$|He {{clasped his}} hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> their faces.|$|R
60|$|Exeunt servants, save {{those two}} who warm the newspaper, {{administer}} the muffins, and serve out the tea. Sir Brian reads his letters, and chumps his dry toast. Ethel whispers to her mother, she thinks Eliza is looking very ill. Lady Anne asks, which is Eliza? Is it {{the woman that}} was ill before they left town? If she is ill, Mrs. Trotter had better send her away. Mrs. Trotter is only a great deal too good-natured. She is always keeping people who are ill. Then her ladyship begins to read the Morning Post, and <b>glances</b> <b>over</b> {{the names of the}} persons who were present at Baroness Bosco's ball, and Mrs. Toddle Tompkyns's soiree dansante in Belgrave Square.|$|E
60|$|So, {{in spite}} of all his subscriptions, and his coaxing of the various orders of Newcomites, Sir Barnes Newcome was not popular among them; and while he had enemies on all sides, had sturdy friends not even on his own. Scarce a man but felt Barnes was {{laughing}} at him; Bulders in his pulpit, Holder who seconded him in his election, the Newcome society; and the ladies, even more than the men, were uneasy under his ominous familiarity, and recovered their good-humour when he left them. People felt {{as if it was a}} truce only, and not an alliance with him, and always speculated on the possibility of war: when he turned his back on them in the market, men felt relieved, and, as they passed his gate, looked with no friendly <b>glances</b> <b>over</b> his park-wall.|$|E
6000|$|His keen eye took {{a single}} {{look at the}} victims, and then shot its <b>glances</b> <b>over</b> the {{difficulties}} of the ascent in his front. A form stood at the brow of the mountain, on {{the very edge of}} the giddy height, with uplifted arms, in an awful attitude of menace. Without stopping to consider his person, the rifle of Hawkeye was raised; but a rock, which fell on the head of one of the fugitives below exposed the indignant and glowing countenance of the honest Gamut. Then Magua issued from a crevice, and stepping with calm indifference over the body of the last of his associates, he leaped a wide fissure, and ascended the rocks at a point where the arm of David could not reach him. A single bound would carry him to the brow of the precipice, and assure his safety. Before taking the leap, however, the Huron paused, and shaking his hand at the scout, he shouted,-- ...|$|E
60|$|The piano {{stopped as}} he entered, {{and the girl}} on the music-stool <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> her shoulder.|$|R
60|$|There was no {{need for}} a reply. A <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> the top of the bush sufficed.|$|R
60|$|Mr Dombey involuntarily <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> the way; and {{an angry}} glance he sent in that direction, too.|$|R
