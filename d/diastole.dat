5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the cardiac cycle, in early <b>diastole,</b> both the atria and ventricles are relaxed. Since blood moves from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, when the chambers are relaxed, blood will flow into the atria (through the coronary sinus and the pulmonary veins). As the atria begin to fill, the pressure will rise so that the blood will move from the atria into the ventricles. In late <b>diastole</b> the atria contract, pumping more blood into the ventricles. This causes a rise in pressure in the ventricles. As the ventricles reach systole, blood will be pumped into the pulmonary artery (right ventricle) or aorta (left ventricle).|$|E
5|$|Preload {{refers to}} the filling {{pressure}} of the atria {{at the end of}} <b>diastole,</b> when they are at their fullest. A main factor is how long it takes the ventricles to fill—if the ventricles contract faster, then there is less time to fill and the preload will be less. Preload can also be affected by a person's blood volume. The force of each contraction of the heart muscle is proportional to the preload, described as the Frank-Starling mechanism. This states that the force of contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of muscle fiber, meaning a ventricle will contract more forcefully, the more it is stretched.|$|E
5|$|The Greek {{physician}} Galen (2nd century CE) knew {{blood vessels}} carried blood and identified venous (dark red) and arterial (brighter and thinner) blood, each with distinct and separate functions. Galen, noting the heart as the hottest organ in the body, {{concluded that it}} provided heat to the body. The heart did not pump blood around, the heart's motion sucked blood in during <b>diastole</b> and the blood moved by the pulsation of the arteries themselves. Galen believed the arterial blood was created by venous blood passing from the left ventricle to the right through 'pores' between the ventricles. Air from the lungs passed from the lungs via the pulmonary artery {{to the left side}} of the heart and created arterial blood.|$|E
5|$|Several imaging {{methods can}} be used to assess the anatomy and {{function}} of the heart, including ultrasound (echocardiography), angiography, CT scans, MRI and PET. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart used to measure the heart's function, assess for valve disease, and look for any abnormalities. Echocardiography can be conducted by a probe on the chest ("transthoracic") or by a probe in the esophagus ("transoesophageal"). A typical echocardiography report will include information about the width of the valves noting any stenosis, whether there is any backflow of blood (regurgitation) and information about the blood volumes at the end of systole and <b>diastole,</b> including an ejection fraction, which describes how much blood is ejected from the left and right ventricles after systole. Ejection fraction can then be obtained by dividing the volume ejected by the heart (stroke volume) by the volume of the filled heart (end-diastolic volume). Echocardiograms can also be conducted under circumstances when the body is more stressed, in order to examine for signs of lack of blood supply. This cardiac stress test involves either direct exercise, or where this is not possible, injection of a drug such as dobutamine.|$|E
25|$|It {{occurs at}} the {{beginning}} of <b>diastole</b> after S2 and is lower in pitch than S1 or S2 as it is not of valvular origin. The third heart sound is benign in youth, some trained athletes, and sometimes in pregnancy but if it re-emerges later in life it may signal cardiac problems, such as a failing left ventricle as in dilated congestive heart failure (CHF). S3 is thought to be caused by the oscillation of blood {{back and forth between the}} walls of the ventricles initiated by blood rushing in from the atria. The reason the third heart sound does not occur until the middle third of <b>diastole</b> is probably that during the early part of <b>diastole,</b> the ventricles are not filled sufficiently to create enough tension for reverberation.|$|E
25|$|Impact {{occurring}} {{within a}} specific 10– to 30-millisecond portion of the cardiac cycle. This period occurs in the ascending phase of the T wave, when the ventricular myocardium is repolarizing, moving from systole to <b>diastole</b> (relaxation).|$|E
25|$|Aortic {{insufficiency}} (AI), {{also known}} as aortic regurgitation (AR), is the leaking of the aortic valve of the heart that causes blood to flow in the reverse direction during ventricular <b>diastole,</b> from the aorta into the left ventricle. As a consequence, the cardiac muscle is forced to work harder than normal.|$|E
25|$|Some squamate species (e.g., pythons {{and monitor}} lizards) have three-chambered hearts that become {{functionally}} four-chambered hearts during contraction. This {{is made possible}} by a muscular ridge that subdivides the ventricle during ventricular <b>diastole</b> and completely divides it during ventricular systole. Because of this ridge, some of these squamates are capable of producing ventricular pressure differentials that are equivalent to those seen in mammalian and avian hearts.|$|E
25|$|Ejection {{fraction}} (EF) is a parameter {{related to}} SV. EF is {{the fraction of}} blood ejected by the left ventricle (LV) during the contraction or ejection phase of the cardiac cycle or systole. Prior {{to the start of}} systole, during the filling phase or <b>diastole,</b> the LV is filled with blood to the capacity known as end diastolic volume (EDV). During systole, the LV contracts and ejects blood until it reaches its minimum capacity known as end systolic volume (ESV). It does not completely empty. The following equations help translate the effect of EF and EDV on cardiac output Q, via SV.|$|E
25|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that most cardiac myocardial cells with an associated increased propensity to arrhythmia development have an associated loss of membrane potential. That is, the maximum diastolic potential is less negative and therefore exists closer to the threshold potential. Cellular depolarisation can be due to a raised external concentration of potassium ions K+, a decreased intracellular concentration of sodium ions Na+, increased permeability to Na+, or a decreased permeability to K+. The ionic basic automaticity is the net gain of an intracellular positive charge during <b>diastole</b> in the presence of a voltage-dependent channel activated by potentials negative to 50 to 60mV.|$|E
25|$|In 2nd century AD Rome, the Greek {{physician}} Galen {{knew that}} blood vessels carried blood and identified venous (dark red) and arterial (brighter and thinner) blood, each with distinct and separate functions. Growth and energy {{were derived from}} venous blood created in the liver from chyle, while arterial blood gave vitality by containing pneuma (air) and originated in the heart. Blood flowed from both creating organs to {{all parts of the}} body where it was consumed and there was no return of blood to the heart or liver. The heart did not pump blood around, the heart's motion sucked blood in during <b>diastole</b> and the blood moved by the pulsation of the arteries themselves.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} of aortic insufficiency (AI), comprises {{the pressure in}} the left ventricle falling below the pressure in the aorta, the aortic valve {{is not able to}} completely close. This causes a leaking of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle. This means that some of the blood that was already ejected from the heart is regurgitating back into the heart. The percentage of blood that regurgitates back through the aortic valve due to AI is known as the regurgitant fraction. This regurgitant flow causes a decrease in the diastolic blood pressure in the aorta, and therefore an increase in the pulse pressure. Since some of the blood that is ejected during systole regurgitates back into the left ventricle during <b>diastole,</b> there is decreased effective forward flow in AI.|$|E
25|$|If {{there is}} {{increased}} stroke {{volume of the}} left ventricle due to volume overload, an ejection systolic 'flow' murmur may also be present when auscultating the same aortic area. Unless there is concomitant aortic valve stenosis, the murmur should not start with an ejection click.There may also be an Austin Flint murmur, a soft mid-diastolic rumble heard at the apical area, it appears when regurgitant jet from the severe aortic insufficiency renders partial closure of the anterior mitral leaflet.Peripheral physical signs of aortic insufficiency {{are related to the}} high pulse pressure and the rapid decrease in blood pressure during <b>diastole</b> due to blood returning to the heart from the aorta through the incompetent aortic valve, although the usefulness of some of the eponymous signs has been questioned: Phonocardiograms detect AI by having electric voltage mimic the sounds the heart makes.|$|E
500|$|The {{cardiac cycle}} {{refers to a}} {{complete}} heartbeat which includes systole and <b>diastole</b> and the intervening pause. The cycle begins with contraction of the atria and ends with relaxation of the ventricles. [...] Systole refers to contraction of the atria or ventricles of the heart. <b>Diastole</b> is when the atria or ventricles relax and fill with blood. The atria and ventricles work in concert, so in systole when the ventricles are contracting, the atria are relaxed and collecting blood. When the ventricles are relaxed in <b>diastole,</b> the atria contract to pump blood to the ventricles. This coordination ensures blood is pumped efficiently to the body.|$|E
500|$|The {{structural}} {{domain of}} cTnC (cCTnC) is anchored to troponin I and T, forming the so-called IT arm, {{made up of}} cTnC93-161, cTnI41-135 and cTnT235-286 (in the cardiac complex). cCTnC binds to helical cTnI41-60 via its large hydrophobic patch, stabilizing the Ca2+-bound open conformation of cCTnC and enhancing its affinity for Ca2+ (from Kd = 40 nM to Kd = 3 nM). cTnT235-286 forms a helical coiled coil with cTnI88-135 that binds to the opposite face of cCTnC. The IT arm is anchored to tropomyosin via adjacent segments of cTnT, so it is believed to move as a unit along with tropomyosin throughout the cardiac cycle. In the low calcium environment present during <b>diastole</b> (~100 nM), tropomyosin is anchored into the [...] "blocked" [...] position along the actin thin filament through the binding of the troponin I inhibitory (cTnI128-147) and C-terminal (cTnI160-209) regions. This prevents actin-myosin cross-bridging and effectively shuts off muscle contraction.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{simplest}} methods of assessing the heart's condition is {{to listen to it}} using a stethoscope. Typically, healthy hearts have only two audible heart sounds, called S1 and S2. The first heart sound S1, is the sound created by the closing of the atrioventricular valves during ventricular contraction and is normally described as [...] "lub". The second heart sound, S2, is the sound of the semilunar valves closing during ventricular <b>diastole</b> and is described as [...] "dub". Each sound consists of two components, reflecting the slight difference in time as the two valves close. S2 may split into two distinct sounds, either as a result of inspiration or different valvular or cardiac problems. Additional heart sounds may also be present and these give rise to gallop rhythms. A third heart sound, S3 usually indicates an increase in ventricular blood volume. A fourth heart sound S4 is referred to as an atrial gallop and is produced by the sound of blood being forced into a stiff ventricle. The combined presence of S3 and S4 give a quadruple gallop.|$|E
2500|$|The normal {{area of the}} {{mitral valve}} orifice is about 4 to 6cm2. In normal cardiac physiology, the mitral valve opens during left {{ventricular}} <b>diastole,</b> to allow blood to flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle. A normal mitral valve will not impede {{the flow of blood}} from the left atrium to the left ventricle during (ventricular) <b>diastole,</b> and the pressures in the left atrium and the left ventricle during ventricular <b>diastole</b> will be equal. [...] The result is that the left ventricle gets filled with blood during early ventricular <b>diastole,</b> with {{only a small portion of}} extra blood contributed by contraction of the left atrium (the [...] "atrial kick") during late ventricular <b>diastole.</b>|$|E
2500|$|An opening snap {{that is a}} high-pitch {{additional}} sound may {{be heard}} after the A2 (aortic) component of the second heart sound (S2), which correlates to the forceful opening of the mitral valve. [...] The mitral valve opens when the pressure in the left atrium {{is greater than the}} pressure in the left ventricle. [...] This happens in ventricular <b>diastole</b> (after closure of the aortic valve), when the pressure in the ventricle precipitously drops. [...] In individuals with mitral stenosis, the pressure in the left atrium correlates with the severity of the mitral stenosis. [...] As the severity of the mitral stenosis increases, the pressure in the left atrium increases, and the mitral valve opens earlier in ventricular <b>diastole.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The echocardiographic {{technique}} {{to measure the}} regurgitant fraction {{is to determine the}} forward flow through the mitral valve (from the left atrium to the left ventricle) during ventricular <b>diastole,</b> and comparing it with the flow out of the left ventricle through the aortic valve in ventricular systole. [...] This method assumes that the aortic valve does not suffer from aortic insufficiency.|$|E
2500|$|... cMyBP-C {{regulates the}} {{positioning}} of myosin and actin for interaction and {{acts as a}} tether to the myosin S1 heads, limiting their mobility. This results in a decreased number of crossbridges formed, which hinders force generation, due to its N-terminal C1-M-C2 region interacting with the myosin-S2 domain. Furthermore, cMyBP-C contributes to the regulation of cardiac contraction at short sarcomere length and is required for complete relaxation in <b>diastole.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Rubs [...] The pericardial {{friction}} rub can {{be heard}} in pericarditis, an inflammation of the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart. This is a characteristic scratching, creaking, high-pitched sound emanating from the rubbing of both layers of inflamed pericardium. It is the loudest in systole, but can often be heard at the beginning {{and at the end of}} <b>diastole.</b> It is very dependent on body position and breathing, and changes from hour to hour.|$|E
2500|$|Acute AI usually {{presents}} as florid {{congestive heart}} failure, {{and will not}} {{have any of the}} signs associated with chronic AI since the left ventricle had not yet developed the eccentric hypertrophy and dilatation that allow an increased stroke volume, which in turn cause bounding peripheral pulses. [...] On auscultation, there may be a short diastolic murmur and a soft S1. [...] S1 is soft because the elevated filling pressures close the mitral valve in <b>diastole.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In most cases, the {{diagnosis}} of mitral stenosis is most easily made by echocardiography, which shows left atrial enlargement, thick and calcified mitral valve with narrow and [...] "fish-mouth"-shaped orifice and signs of right ventricular failure in advanced disease. It can also show decreased opening of the mitral valve leaflets, and increased blood flow velocity during <b>diastole.</b> The trans-mitral gradient as measured by Doppler echocardiography is the gold standard {{in the evaluation of}} the severity of mitral stenosis.|$|E
2500|$|With a sinus rhythm, the mitral annulus {{undergoes}} dynamic {{changes during}} the cardiac cycle. For example, {{at the end}} of <b>diastole</b> [...] the annular area is smaller than {{at the end of}} systole. A possible reason for this dynamic size difference is that the coordinated contraction of the left atrium acts like a sphincter about the mitral annulus and [...] reduces its size. This may be important for mitral valve competence so that it does not leak when the left ventricle pumps blood. However, when the left atrium fibrillates, this sphincter action is not possible and may contribute to, or result in, mitral regurgitation in some cases.|$|E
2500|$|Any {{process that}} {{increases}} the pressure in the left ventricle can cause worsening of the left-to-right shunt. [...] This includes hypertension, which increases the pressure that the left ventricle has to generate to open the aortic valve during ventricular systole, and coronary artery disease which increases the stiffness of the left ventricle, thereby increasing the filling pressure of the left ventricle during ventricular <b>diastole.</b> [...] The left-to-right shunt increases the filling pressure of the right heart (preload) and forces the right ventricle to pump out more blood than the left ventricle. [...] This constant overloading of {{the right side of}} the heart causes an overload of the entire pulmonary vasculature. [...] Eventually, pulmonary hypertension may develop.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is a sign}} of a {{pathologic}} state, {{usually a}} failing or hypertrophic left ventricle, as in systemic hypertension, severe valvular aortic stenosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The sound occurs just after atrial contraction at the end of <b>diastole</b> and immediately before S1, producing a rhythm sometimes referred to as the [...] "Tennessee" [...] gallop where S4 represents the [...] "Ten-" [...] syllable. It is best heard at the cardiac apex with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position and holding his breath. [...] The combined presence of S3 and S4 is a quadruple gallop, also known as the [...] "Hello-Goodbye" [...] gallop. At rapid heart rates, S3 and S4 may merge to produce a summation gallop, sometimes referred to as S7.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{mitral valve}} area goes below 2cm2, the valve causes an {{impediment}} to {{the flow of blood}} into the left ventricle, creating a pressure gradient across the mitral valve. [...] This gradient may be increased by increases in the heart rate or cardiac output. [...] As the gradient across the mitral valve increases, the amount of time necessary to fill the left ventricle with blood increases. [...] Eventually, the left ventricle requires the atrial kick to fill with blood. [...] As the heart rate increases, {{the amount of time that}} the ventricle is in <b>diastole</b> and can fill up with blood (called the diastolic filling period) decreases. [...] When the heart rate goes above a certain point, the diastolic filling period is insufficient to fill the ventricle with blood and pressure builds up in the left atrium, leading to pulmonary congestion.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second heart}} sound, or S2, forms the [...] "dub" [...] of [...] "lub-dub" [...] and is {{composed}} of components A2 (aortic valve closure) and P2 (pulmonary valve closure). Normally A2 precedes P2 especially during inspiration where a split of S2 can be heard. It {{is caused by the}} closure of the semilunar valves (the aortic valve and pulmonary valve) at the end of ventricular systole and the beginning of ventricular <b>diastole.</b> As the left ventricle empties, its pressure falls below the pressure in the aorta. [...] Aortic blood flow quickly reverses back toward the left ventricle, catching the pocket-like cusps of the aortic valve, and is stopped by aortic valve closure. [...] Similarly, as the pressure in the right ventricle falls below the pressure in the pulmonary artery, the pulmonary valve closes. The S2 sound results from reverberation within the blood associated with the sudden block of flow reversal.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{method of}} {{measuring}} {{the severity of}} mitral stenosis is the simultaneous left and right heart chamber catheterization. The right heart catheterization (commonly known as Swan-Ganz catheterization) gives the physician the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, which {{is a reflection of}} the left atrial pressure. [...] The left heart catheterization, on the other hand, gives the pressure in the left ventricle. [...] By simultaneously taking these pressures, it is possible to determine the gradient between the left atrium and left ventricle during ventricular <b>diastole,</b> which is a marker for the severity of mitral stenosis. [...] This method of evaluating mitral stenosis tends to overestimate the degree of mitral stenosis, however, because of the time lag in the pressure tracings seen on the right-heart catheterization and the slow Y descent seen on the wedge tracings. [...] If a trans-septal puncture is made during right heart catheterization, however, the pressure gradient can accurately quantify the severity of mitral stenosis.|$|E
2500|$|Physiologically, in {{individuals}} with a normally functioning aortic valve, the valve is only open when the pressure in the left ventricle {{is higher than the}} pressure in the aorta. This allows the blood to be ejected from the left ventricle into the aorta during ventricular systole. The amount of blood that is ejected by the heart is known as the stroke volume. Under normal conditions, [...] >50% of the blood in a filled left ventricle is ejected into the aorta to be used by the body. After ventricular systole, the pressure in the left ventricle decreases as it relaxes and begins to fill up with blood from the left atrium. [...] This relaxation of the left ventricle (early ventricular <b>diastole)</b> causes a fall in its pressure. When the pressure in the left ventricle falls below the pressure in the aorta, the aortic valve will close, preventing blood in the aorta from going back into the left ventricle.|$|E
2500|$|The body cavity {{is known}} as a [...] "pseudocoel", or haemocoel. Unlike a true coelom, a pseudocoel is not fully {{enclosed}} by a cell layer derived from the embryonic mesoderm. A coelom is, however, formed around the gonads and the waste-eliminating nephridia. As the name haemocoel suggests, the body cavity is filled with a blood-like liquid in which all the organs are embedded; in this way, they can be easily supplied with nutrients circulating in the blood. This liquid is colourless as it does not contain pigments; for this reason, it only serves a limited role in oxygen transport. Two different types of blood cells (or haemocytes) circulate in the fluid: amoebocytes and nephrocytes. The amoebocytes probably function in protection from bacteria and other foreign bodies; in some species, they also play a role in reproduction. Nephrocytes absorb toxins or convert them into a form suitable for elimination by the nephridia. The haemocoel is divided by a horizontal partition, the diaphragm, into two parts: the pericardial sinus along the back and the perivisceral sinus along the belly. The former encloses the tube-like heart, and the latter, the other organs. The diaphragm is perforated in many places, enabling the exchange of fluids between the two cavities. The heart itself is a tube of annular muscles consisting of epithelial tissues, with two lateral openings (...) per segment. While it is not known whether the rear end is open or closed, from the front, it opens directly into the body cavity. Since there are no blood vessels, apart from the fine vessels running between the muscle layers of the body wall and a pair of arteries that supply the antennae, this is referred to as an open circulation. The timing of the pumping procedure can be divided into two parts: <b>diastole</b> and systole. During <b>diastole,</b> blood flows through the ostia from the pericardial sinus (the cavity containing the heart) into the heart. When the systole begins, the ostia close and the heart muscles contract inwards, reducing the volume of the heart. This pumps the blood from {{the front end of the}} heart into the perivisceral sinus containing the organs. In this way, the various organs are supplied with nutrients before the blood finally returns to the pericardial sinus via the perforations in the diaphragm. In addition to the pumping action of the heart, body movements also have an influence on circulation.|$|E
