50|$|After the Second World War various {{attempts}} were made to increase the rate of fire of the Berezin machine gun. Reducing the cycle time by increasing the speed of the moving parts was the most obvious thing to do. However, this resulted in a considerable reduction of life and reliability. Another attempt was to reduce the motion length of the moving parts while retaining their speed within permissible limits. N. M. Afanasev took a different approach by introducing an acceleration lever, which transferred the energy of a short motion actuating slide into a long motion of a chambering and case <b>extraction</b> <b>arm.</b> This way the motion length of the actuating slide could remain shorter than the overall length of the cartridge, thus increasing the rate of fire. Later, the same operating mechanism was used in the 23mm AM-23 and ZSU-23 cannon as well.|$|E

30|$|With {{regards to}} {{cardiovascular}} regulation, {{with a similar}} absolute pulmonary oxygen uptake (VO 2), delivery of O 2 to the arms and VO 2 are higher, but extraction of O 2 by the arms lower with DP than DIA (Calbet et al. 2005). In the case of DIA, when exercise intensity is reduced from high to moderate, O 2 <b>extraction</b> in the <b>arms</b> is lowered {{to a greater extent}} than in the legs, probably due to a more pronounced decrease in the activation of arm muscles (Björklund et al. 2010). With DP the opposite is observed, i.e., O 2 <b>extraction</b> in the <b>arms</b> is reduced to a lesser extent than in the legs as the intensity of exercise is diminished, apparently because strong activation of the muscles of the upper-body is maintained (Stöggl et al. 2013).|$|R
30|$|Another {{explanation}} for the attenuated <b>arm</b> O 2 <b>extraction</b> during DP could be the decrease in total activated muscle mass, as reflected by the increased sum IEMG and AEMG values during DIA compared to DP. Mortensen et al. (2008) demonstrated that when activating a larger muscle mass (two-legged supra maximal cycling compared with one-legged exercise), locomotor skeletal muscle perfusion leveled off with a concomitant larger increase in O 2 extraction. Furthermore, comparisons between arm cycling vs. combined arm and leg cycling shows a decrease in arm blood flow when adding leg to arm exercise {{but at the same}} time increased O 2 <b>extraction</b> in the <b>arms</b> (Volianitis and Secher 2002). More specifically, in a study by Calbet et al. (2004) arm blood flow was substantially higher using DP than DIA although at a similar cardiac output. Therefore, in the current study high-intensity DIA likely induce additional central cardiovascular stress due to an increased activated total muscle mass than DP – as demonstrated by the augmented sum IEMG and AMEG values - and thus induces a higher O 2 <b>extraction</b> in both <b>arms</b> and legs to match the increased O 2 demand.|$|R
30|$|Due to {{the lack}} of blood flow {{measurements}} it cannot be definitively concluded whether the differences in O 2 <b>extraction</b> between the <b>arms</b> and legs and between DP and DIA are due to differences in blood flow and/or metabolic demands. Further arterial blood pressure measurements could add information regarding the effect of arm swing and cycle rate influence of both O 2 extraction and blood flow. This link was especially pronounced during mainly upper-body work, i.e. DP in the current study.|$|R
30|$|Accordingly, the upper-body {{muscle fatigue}} induced by high-intensity DP might alter the {{relative}} activation of {{arm and leg}} muscles, together with pole and plantar forces, during subsequent high-intensity DIA. Thus, our aim here {{was to examine the}} influence of DP on subsequent DIA at a simulated race intensity of ~ 90 % of VO 2 max/peak from a biomechanical and physiological perspective. The hypothesis was that DP alters the distribution of work between the upper- and lower-body, i.e., decreases pole force and activation of arm muscles during subsequent DIA, thereby reducing the O 2 <b>extraction</b> by the <b>arms.</b>|$|R

30|$|One of {{the novel}} {{findings}} was the decreased <b>arm</b> O 2 <b>extraction</b> during DP compared with DIA, although increased upper-body muscle activation (up to ~ 100 % of MVC in DP vs. 70 % of MVC in DIA). The result of a lower <b>arm</b> O 2 <b>extraction</b> during DP than DIA have previously been demonstrated by Calbet et al. (2005) using a lower exercise intensity (76 vs. 90 % of VO 2 max/peak). Furthermore, there was an interaction effect caused by a more pronounced decrease in O 2 <b>extraction</b> in <b>arms</b> than legs when switching from DIA 1 to DP and back to DIA 2. The reason for a lower <b>arm</b> O 2 <b>extraction</b> during DP has been shown, at least in part, {{to be due to}} a possible mechanical hindrance caused by high pole force generation and high arm muscle activity (~ 96 % MVC) that hinders further elevation of O 2 extraction (Stöggl et al. 2013). The current study supports this finding, based on the reduction in <b>arm</b> O 2 <b>extraction</b> despite increased pole forces and upper body muscle activation when comparing DP with DIA.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} explain the role of governmental and non-governmental actors in increasing/reducing the emergence of intergroup conflict after war, when group differences have been a salient aspect of group mobilization. This question emerges from several interrelated branches of scholarship on self-enforcing institutions and power-sharing arrangements, group fragmentation and demographic change, collective mobilization for collectively-targeted violence, and conflict termination and the post-conflict quality of peace. This question is investigated through quantitative analyses performed at the sub-national, national, and cross-national level {{on the effect of}} elite competition on the likelihood of violence committed on the basis of group difference after war. These quantitative analyses are each accompanied by qualitative, case study analyses drawn from the American Reconstruction South, Iraq, and Cote d'Ivoire that illustrate and clarify the mechanisms evaluated through quantitative analysis. Shared findings suggest the correlation of reduced political competition with the increased likelihood of violence committed on the basis of group difference. Separate findings shed light on how covariates related to control over rent <b>extraction</b> and <b>armed</b> forces, decentralization, and citizenship can lead to a reduction in violence. However, these same quantitative analyses and case study analysis suggest that the control of the state can be perceived as a threat after the end of conflict. Further, together these findings suggest the political nature of violence committed on the basis of group difference as opposed to ethnic identity or resource scarcity alone. Together, these combined analyses shed light on how and why political identities are formed and mobilized for the purpose of committing political violence after war. In this sense, they shed light on the factors that constrain post-conflict violence in deeply divided societies, and contribute to relevant academic, policy, and normative questions.

30|$|The major {{findings}} of the study using repeated high-intensity DIA bouts interspersed with high-intensity DP were: 1) DP did not alter the redistribution in muscle activation between {{arms and legs and}} any further biomechanical variables between DIA 1 and DIA 2. 2) O 2 <b>extraction</b> in both <b>arms</b> and legs was unaffected by DP as O 2 extraction was unchanged between DIA 1 and DIA 2. However, <b>arm</b> O 2 <b>extraction</b> decreased during DP compared to DIA despite higher muscle activation, a three-fold increase in pole ground reaction force and an augmented blood lactate concentration in the arms. 3) Leg O 2 extraction was related to a greater unloading of the lower body by a more dynamic lower body work during DP and both DIA, while <b>arm</b> O 2 <b>extraction</b> was associated with cycle characteristics (e.g. cycle length, cycle rate, swing time) for DP only. Interestingly, a greater ratio of upper- to whole-body muscle activation at both DIA 1 and DIA 2 was associated to an attenuated <b>arm</b> O 2 <b>extraction.</b> 4) Pulmonary VO 2 did not increase over time as VO 2 for DIA 1 and DIA 2 was similar. However, there was an apparent acid base disturbance from DIA 1 to DIA 2 reflected by a decrease in pH, bicarbonate and an increase in lactate both systemically and for venous arm and leg blood.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} prior high intensity double poling (DP) on physiological and biomechanical responses during subsequent diagonal stride (DIA). Methods: Eight well-trained male cross-country skiers (age 22 ± 3 yr; VO 2 max 69 ± 3 ml · kg− 1 · min− 1) roller-skied on a treadmill sequentially for 3 min at 90 % DIA VO 2 max (DIA 1), 3 min at 90 % DP VO 2 peak and 3 min at 90 % DIA VO 2 max (DIA 2). Cardio-respiratory responses were monitored continuously and gases and metabolites in blood from the a. femoralis, v. femoralis and v. subclavia determined. Pole and plantar forces and EMG from 6 lower- and upper-body muscles were measured. Results: VO 2 decreased from DIA 1 to DP and increased again to DIA 2 (both P &lt; 0. 05), with {{no difference between the}} DIA sessions. Blood lactate rose from DIA 1 to DP to DIA 2.

40|$|Cross-country skiing {{has been}} of great {{interest}} for exercise physiologists during the last century and is {{regarded as one of}} the most demanding endurance sports. Of special interest is that the athletes have extraordinary high aerobic power and that both upper and lower body muscles are involved to various degrees in the different skiing techniques. The overall objective of the present thesis has been to examine and possibly extend the understanding of the physiology in cross-country skiing. In addition, elite cross country skiers with highly trained arms and leg muscles enabled us to study some more general physiological questions. Eight articles are included in the thesis, divided into three major parts: 1) Contribution of the upper body in cross-country skiing (Study I-III), 2) Lung function (Study IV-V) and 3) Oxygen delivery and oxygen uptake (Study VI-VII). The biomechanical data in Study I revealed that pole force, in contrast to poling frequency, is related to double poling (DP) velocity and is influenced by specific muscle activation patterns and a specific characteristic flexion-extension pattern in the elbow, hip and ankle joints with the angle minima occurring around the peak pole force. Moreover, that the muscles during DP are engaged in a sequential order starting with trunk and hip flexors, followed by shoulder and elbow extensors. Finally, that the best skiers use a special technical strategy with specific characteristics related to DP velocity. Study II and III demonstrated that specific DP training has a substantial effect on DP performance and improvements in DP performance were related to biomechanical as well as physiological parameters, shown in Study III by a parallel muscle adaptation in factors of importance for production of force as well as endurance and a bilateral transformation of MHC isoforms towards MHC IIA isoform. Study IV demonstrated that the measured lung function variables in elite skiers are only about 5 - 20 % higher compared to sedentary persons, supporting the notion of a substantially larger trainability of cardiovascular and metabolic as compared to pulmonary functions. Furthermore, by using pulse oximetry, elite c. c. skiers are able to maintain their arterial 02 saturation fairly well during submaximal exercise. During exhaustive exercise using diagonal skiing, double poling and running, the degree of desaturation was relatively low and less than what have earlier been reported in some highly trained endurance athletes. Furthermore, the ventilatory response was different in the exercise modes examined. These data were supported by invasive results from Study V performed with a similar cardiac output. Of special note was that the use of the DP technique demonstrated a better pulmonary gas exchange, and consequently a less degree of desaturation, compared to the other examined skiing techniques. Half of the reduction in the arterial saturation, during the different exercise modes during submaximal exercise, was accounted to the rightward-shift of the oxygen dissociation curve of the haemoglobin. In Study VI vascular conductance and blood pressure were adjusted to match 02 delivery with the local tissue demand. Limb vascular conductance was linearly related to limb V 02 during submaximal exercise. Moreover, the results support that maximal vasodilatory response during maximal whole body exercise has to be restrained. If not, the systemic vascular conductance would overwhelm the maximal pumping capacity of the heart and hypotension would ensue. In Study VII, the torso received ~ 80 % of the cardiac output at rest and consumed more than 85 % of the resting V 02. During exercise the share of the systemic blood flow and the V 02 was 25 % or less which only represented a 3 -fold elevation in absolute values, although cross-country skiing quite intensely involves all muscles of the torso. Altogether, these data point at a most efficient interaction between the torso muscles involved in force development for propulsion and the respiratory muscles, and the respiratory aerobic energy turnover was estimated to be ~ 5 % of pulmonary oxygen uptake during moderate to intense exercise. Finally, in Study VIII, the oxygen <b>extraction,</b> in the <b>arms</b> but not in the legs, was closely related to the in vivo P 50 during arm exercise in the cross-country skiers with highly endurance trained arm and leg muscles and that the arms, for a given P 50 value, had a lower O 2 extraction and lower capillary muscle O 2 conductance values compared to the leg muscles. Sincethe conditions for the O 2 off-loading from the haemoglobin were similar in leg and arm muscles, the observed differences in maximal arm and leg O 2 extraction is suggested to be due to a higher diffusing distance and higher heterogeneity in the distribution of blood flow between and within muscles, shorter mean transit time, and smaller diffusing area in the arms compared to the leg muscles...|$|R
