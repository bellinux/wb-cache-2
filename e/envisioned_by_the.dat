5|$|Anton Meyer is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC medical drama Holby City, played by actor George Irving. He {{appeared in the}} series from its first episode, broadcast on 12 January 1999, until series four, episode 46, broadcast on 20 August 2002. His role in the show is that of consultant cardiothoracic surgeon {{and head of the}} cardiothoracic surgery department at Holby General. Irving had considerable input in creating the character, who was initially <b>envisioned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> series producers as an Iranian surgeon named Hussein. At Irving's suggestion, Meyer became Hungarian, an emigrant to Britain following the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. Little of the backstory created for Meyer was ever revealed on-screen, as part of a deliberate bid to present the character as enigmatic, allowing viewers to project their own imagination onto him.|$|E
5|$|Donald Cousens Parkway and {{a planned}} {{connection}} with Morningside Avenue form the East Metro Transportation Corridor, originally <b>envisioned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> province in the 1970s as a six lane municipal expressway. During the mid-1990s, the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) conducted studies and identified {{the need for}} the corridor by 2011. Although York had intended for a continuous alignment, the City of Toronto has opposed the direct connection between Morningside and Donald Cousens Parkway. As a result, it is now proposed to connect Morningside Avenue and Donald Cousens Parkway via a widened Steeles Avenue. However, no timeline has been announced as of 2015.|$|E

5|$|Lincoln {{understood}} that the Federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865, committed the issue to individual states. He argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new U.S. territory. At {{the beginning of the}} war, he also sought to persuade the states to accept compensated emancipation in return for their prohibition of slavery. Lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it, as <b>envisioned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Founding Fathers, under the constitution. President Lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by Major General John C. Frémont in August 1861 and by Major General David Hunter in May 1862, {{on the grounds that it}} was not within their power, and it would upset the border states loyal to the Union.|$|E

50|$|Infrastructure: The {{second problem}} is the {{infrastructure}} required for an installation. Until room-temperature superconductors are found, the 100 mile (160 km) loop of wire {{would have to be}} contained within a vacuum flask of liquid nitrogen. This in turn would require stable support, most commonly <b>envisioned</b> <b>by</b> burying <b>the</b> installation.|$|R
50|$|As {{with all}} {{delegated}} legislation, because statutory instruments {{are made by}} a person exercising a power conferred by an Act of Parliament for a specified purpose, rather than by Parliament exercising its sovereign law-making powers, they can be struck down <b>by</b> <b>the</b> courts if it is concluded that they are ultra vires (literally, outside <b>the</b> powers conferred <b>by</b> <b>the</b> parent Act). This {{would be the case}} if the Government attempts to use delegated legislation for a purpose not <b>envision</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> parent Act, or if the legislation is an unreasonable use of <b>the</b> power conferred <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Act, or if pre-conditions imposed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Act (for example, consultation with certain organisations) have not been satisfied.|$|R
25|$|If a {{constitution}} no longer meets {{the exigencies of}} a society's evolving standard of decency, and the people wish to amend or replace the document, there is nothing stopping them from doing so in the manner which was <b>envisioned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> drafters: through the amendment process. The Living Constitution approach would thus only be valuable {{in the absence of}} an amendment process.|$|E
25|$|Laotian General Phasouk Somly Rasphakdi, who {{commanded}} MR 4, began investigating {{possibilities for}} a civic action program in Wapikhamthong Province {{as early as}} 1963.

25|$|It {{quickly became}} {{apparent}} to {{federal agencies and}} members of Congress, however, {{that the federal government}} had to restore control over architectural design and development in areas adjacent to the sites proposed for parks and buildings in the McMillan plan.

25|$|With {{the ascent}} of the Nazis to power on 30 January 1933, the {{so-called}} Machtergreifung, the party {{immediately began to}} disassemble {{the power of the}} German states, the Länder.

In reality, Hitler was afraid of such a move, fearing it would upset local party leaders and could possibly result in an inner-party power struggle.|$|E

In addition, there are also plans to extend the line to Feldomching. This was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Figures of Germans evacuated, migrated, or {{expelled}} by 1950 totalled 8,030,000. Early expulsions in Poland were {{undertaken by}} the Polish Communist military authorities even before the Potsdam Conference ("wild expulsions"), to ensure the later integration into an ethnically homogeneous Poland as <b>envisioned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Polish Communists. Overall about 1% (100,000) of the German civilian population east of the Oder–Neisse line perished in the fighting prior to the surrender in May 1945.|$|E

25|$|The {{annexation}} of Taiwan was {{also based on}} practical considerations of benefit to Japan. Tokyo expected the large and productive island to furnish provisions and raw materials for Japan's expanding economy and to become a ready market for Japanese goods. Taiwan's strategic location was deemed advantageous as well. As <b>envisioned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> navy, the island would form a southern bastion of defense from which to safeguard southernmost China and southeastern Asia. These considerations accurately forecast the major roles Taiwan would play in Japan's quest for power, wealth, and great empire.|$|E
25|$|A {{rail-based}} {{solution to}} connect Mount Carmel with downtown Haifa was <b>envisioned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British mandatory authorities. However, only in 1955, {{under the auspices}} of then-mayor Abba Hushi, did practical talks begin. The French company Compagnie Dunkerquoise d'Entreprises created a detailed plan and proposed to a generous loan for {{a large part of the}} project, and a deal was signed in 1956. The plan was for a funicular system, and the inauguration took place in 1959, attended among others by the French transport minister Robert Buron and Israeli prime minister David Ben Gurion.|$|E

50|$|The Blade Runner soundtrack was {{composed}} by Vangelis for Ridley Scott's 1982 film Blade Runner.

40|$|We {{study the}} Wigner {{crystallization}} in semiconductor quantum wires within the density-functional approach.

25|$|The {{location}} of the fortress {{used to be the}} marketplace of the Vehkalahti, which had received city rights in 1653 under the name of Vehkalahden Uusikaupunki. The city was destroyed in the Great Northern War in 1712. The construction of the fortress began by Swedish general Axel von Löwen after the Treaty of Nystadt in early 1720s. Von Löwen wanted to prevent the Russian advance into the Gulf of Finland as <b>envisioned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Tsar Peter the Great, who wanted to open the sea routes for Russia.

25|$|The 2008 global {{financial}} crisis {{was seen as}} being {{a threat to the}} goals <b>envisioned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> charter, and also set forth the idea of a proposed human rights body to be discussed at a future summit in February 2009. This proposition caused controversy, as the body would not have the power to impose sanctions or punish countries which violated citizens' rights and would therefore be limited in effectiveness. The body was established later in 2009 as the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR). In November 2012, the commission adopted the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration.|$|E
25|$|ARPA {{released}} its Hardpoint study in 1965. It presented {{a way for}} the Army to offer an effective ABM system at a reasonable cost. At the same time, it would ensure that the Air Force's missiles would survive any sort of small-scale attack <b>envisioned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> military planners. This led to a series of Army-Air Force studies under the name Hardsite. Hardsite initially considered the idea of using the existing Nike-X hardware being proposed around large cities to deliberately offer additional protection to Air Force and other military bases in the area. A second series of studies considered cut-down deployments to protect remote bases, like the missile fields. This later concept quickly captured the majority of follow-up work.|$|E
