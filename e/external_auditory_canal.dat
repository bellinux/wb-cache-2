2500|$|A bone {{anchored}} {{hearing aid}} (BAHA) is an auditory prosthetic based on bone conduction {{which can be}} surgically implanted. It is an option for patients without external ear canals, when conventional hearing aids with a mould in the ear cannot be used. The BAHA uses the skull as a pathway for sound {{to travel to the}} inner ear. [...] For people with conductive hearing loss, the BAHA bypasses the <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>canal</b> and middle ear, stimulating the functioning cochlea. [...] For people with unilateral hearing loss, the BAHA uses the skull to conduct the sound from the deaf side to the side with the functioning cochlea.|$|E
2500|$|Barotrauma {{can affect}} the external, middle, or inner ear. [...] Middle ear {{barotrauma}} (MEBT) {{is the most common}} being experienced by between 10% and 30% of divers and is due to insufficient equilibration of the middle ear. [...] External ear barotrauma may occur on ascent if high pressure air is trapped in the <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>canal</b> either by tight fitting diving equipment or ear wax. [...] Inner ear barotrauma (IEBT), though much less common than MEBT, shares a similar mechanism. [...] Mechanical trauma to the inner ear can lead to varying degrees of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss as well as vertigo. It is also common for conditions affecting the inner ear to result in auditory hypersensitivity.|$|E

50|$|Ceruminous glands are {{specialized}} sudoriferous glands (sweat glands) located subcutaneously in the <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>canal,</b> in {{the outer}} 1/3.

40|$|OBJETIVO: Determinar a eficácia dos fones de inserção em casos de suspeita de colabamento de meato acústico externo. MÉTODOS: Vinte e um idosos com intervalo aéreo-ósseo {{superior}} a 10 dBNA nas frequências de 3 kHz e/ou 4 kHz foram submetidos à anamne se, audiometria tonal liminar, logoaudiometria e imitanciometria. A audiometria tonal e a logoaudiometria foram realizadas com os fones supra-aurais e com fones de inserção. RESULTADOS: Verificou-se que os limiares auditivos por via aérea obtidos com os fones de inserção foram menores em todas as frequências com exceção de 1 kHz. O intervalo aéreo-ósseo também foi menor com o fone de inserção, havendo um acoplamento aéreo-ósseo com este transdutor. CONCLUSÃO: Os fones de inserção ER- 3 A possibilitam melhora significativa nos limiares de audibilidade por via aérea em idosos, diminuindo ou até eliminando o intervalo aéreo-ósseo, sobretudo nas frequências altas, nos casos de colabamento do meato acústico externo. PURPOSE: To {{determine the}} efficacy of insert earphones in cases of collapsed <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>canals.</b> METHODS: Twenty-one elderly individuals with air-bone gaps greater than 10 dBHL at frequencies of 3 kHz and/or 4 kHz underwent anamnesis, pure tone audiometry, speech audiometry, and immittance test. Pure tone audiometry and speech audiometry were performed with both supra-aural and insert earphones. RESULTS: Air conduction thresholds were lower with insert earphones at all frequencies except 1 kHz. The magnitude of the air-bone gap was also lower with the insert earphones, {{and there was a}} air-bone coupling with this transducer. CONCLUSION: Insert earphones ER- 3 A allowed significant improvement in air conduction hearing thresholds in elderly individuals, reducing or even eliminating the air-bone gap in cases of collapsed <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>canals,</b> especially at higher frequencies...|$|R

He had bilateral atresia of <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>canals,</b> and malformation of the pinna. The initial hearing rehabilitation was with bone vibration arch, but there was poor acceptance due the discomfort caused by skull compression. It was prescribed a model of bone-anchored hearing aid, in soft band format. The results were evaluated through behavioral hearing tests and questionnaires Meaningful Use of Speech Scale (MUSS) and Infant-Toddler Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale (IT-MAIS). Comments: The patient had a higher acceptance of the bone-anchored hearing aid compared to the traditional bone vibration arch. Audiological tests and the speech and auditory skills assessments also showed better communication and hearing outcomes.

In March 2009, she experienced an acute right-sided insulotemporal intracerebral hemorrhage. Immediately after this event, the patient complained of hearing loss with the inability to hear all sounds except for severe bilateral tinnitus. Imaging revealed sequelae in the left cerebral cortex from her previous CVA. The new right-sided hemorrhage was centered on the posterior putamen with surrounding edema involving the posterior portion of the posterior limbs of the internal, external, and extreme capsules. Signal abnormalities extended into the right temporal lobe. The patient had no other neurologic deficits and spoke fluently, although with poor internal volume control of her voice. Otoscopic examination revealed normal-appearing <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>canals,</b> intact tympanic membranes bilaterally, and normal middle ear anatomy.

The present report describes a series of 20 patients with CAA, of whom 18 had microscopically visible 18 q deletions. The extent {{and nature of the}} chromosome- 18 deletions were studied in detail by array-based comparative genomic hybridization (arrayCGH). High-resolution chromosome- 18 profiles were obtained for all patients, and a critical region of 5 Mb that was deleted in all patients with CAA could be defined on 18 q 22. 3 - 18 q 23. Therefore, this region can be considered as a candidate region for aural atresia. The array-based high-resolution copy-number screening enabled a refined cytogenetic diagnosis in 12 patients. Our approach appeared to be applicable to the detection of genetic mosaicisms and, in particular, to a detailed delineation of ring chromosomes. This study clearly demonstrates the power of the arrayCGH technology in high-resolution molecular karyotyping. Deletion and amplification mapping can now be performed at the submicroscopic level and will allow high-throughput definition of genomic regions harboring disease genes...|$|R
