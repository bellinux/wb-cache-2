500|$|Unlike many Democrats, John F. Kennedy, {{who served}} in the Senate with McCarthy from 1953 until the latter's death in 1957, never {{attacked}} McCarthy. McCarthy had refused to campaign for Kennedy's 1952 opponent, Republican incumbent Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., due to his friendship with the Kennedys. When a speaker at a February 1952 final club dinner stated that he was glad McCarthy had not attended Harvard College, an angry Kennedy jumped up, denounced the speaker, and left the event. Asked by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. why he avoided criticism of McCarthy, Kennedy said, [...] "Hell, <b>half</b> <b>my</b> voters in Massachusetts look on McCarthy as a hero." ...|$|E

500|$|John F. Stossel {{was born}} on March 6, 1947, in Chicago Heights, Illinois, the younger of two sons, to Jewish parents who left Germany before Hitler rose to power. They joined a Congregationalist church in the U.S., and Stossel was raised Protestant. He grew up on Chicago's {{affluent}} North Shore and graduated from New Trier High School. Stossel characterizes his older brother, Tom, as [...] "the superstar of the family", commenting, [...] "While I partied and played poker, he studied hard, got top grades, and went to Harvard Medical School." [...] Stossel characterizes himself as having been [...] "an indifferent student" [...] while in college, commenting, [...] "I daydreamed through <b>half</b> <b>my</b> classes at Princeton, and applied to grad school only because I was ambitious, and grad school seemed like the right path for a 21-year-old who wanted to get ahead." [...] Although he had been accepted to the University of Chicago's School of Hospital Management, Stossel was [...] "sick of school" [...] and thought taking a job would inspire him to embrace graduate studies with renewed vigor.|$|E
500|$|The {{arrival in}} Oxford in October 1922 of the {{sophisticated}} Etonians Harold Acton and Brian Howard changed Waugh's Oxford life. Acton and Howard rapidly became {{the centre of}} an avant-garde circle known as the Hypocrites, whose artistic, social and homosexual values Waugh adopted enthusiastically; he later wrote: [...] "It was the stamping ground of <b>half</b> <b>my</b> Oxford life". He began drinking heavily, and embarked {{on the first of}} several homosexual relationships, the most lasting of which were with Richard Pares and Alastair Graham. He continued to write reviews and short stories for the university journals, and developed a reputation as a talented graphic artist, but formal study largely ceased. This neglect led to a bitter feud between Waugh and his history tutor, C. R. M. F. Cruttwell, dean (and later principal) of Hertford College. When Cruttwell advised him to mend his ways, Waugh responded in a manner, he admitted later, was [...] "fatuously haughty", from then on, relations between the two descended into mutual hatred. Waugh continued the feud long after his Oxford days by using Cruttwell's name in his early novels for a succession of ludicrous, ignominious or odious minor characters.|$|E
500|$|Though Forbes Field {{was praised}} upon its opening, {{it began to}} show its age after 60 years of use. The park was the second oldest {{baseball}} field in the league at the time – only Shibe Park in Philadelphia was older (it too was replaced in 1971 by Veterans Stadium). The location of the park, which was initially criticized for not being developed, grew into a [...] "bustling business district" [...] {{which led to a}} lack of parking space. One sportswriter wrote that The House of Thrills had become [...] "as joyless as a prison exercise yard". Following a plan to expand their adjacent campus, the University of Pittsburgh purchased Forbes Field in 1958, with an agreement to lease the stadium to the Pirates until a replacement could be built. A proposal for a new sports stadium in Pittsburgh was first made in 1948, but plans did not attract much attention until the late 1950s. Construction began on Three Rivers Stadium on April 25, 1968. The Pittsburgh Pirates and the Chicago Cubs played a double-header on June 28, 1970. Pittsburgh won the first game 3–2. In the later game Al Oliver hit the last home run in the park, and Matty Alou drove in two runs as the Pirates closed the 62-year-old stadium with a 4–1 victory. The 40,918 spectators in attendance stood and cheered as Dave Giusti retired Willie Smith for the final out at the stadium. Pirates Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente played 15 seasons at Forbes Field. He was emotional during the last game saying, [...] "I spent <b>half</b> <b>my</b> life there." [...] After the game, home plate was dug up and taken by helicopter to Three Rivers Stadium to be installed in the artificial turf.|$|E

2500|$|The 1970 {{season was}} the last one that the Pirates played at Forbes Field before moving to Three Rivers Stadium; for Clemente, abandoning this stadium was an {{emotional}} situation. The Pirates' final game at Forbes Field occurred on June 28, 1970. That day, Clemente noted that it was hard to play in a different field, saying, [...] "I spent <b>half</b> <b>my</b> life there." [...] The night of July 24, 1970, was declared [...] "Roberto Clemente Night"; on this day, several Puerto Rican fans traveled to Three Rivers Stadium and cheered Clemente while wearing traditional Puerto Rican attire. A ceremony to honor Clemente took place, during which he received a scroll with 300,000 signatures compiled in Puerto Rico, and several thousands of dollars were donated to charity work following Clemente's request.|$|E

Of course, during the course of doing it, there's been all kinds of ups and downs, and moments of extreme (positivity), floating on clouds of greatness, and times of just groveling, and misery, and uncertainty, and anger, and love and all those things. Like being in a family. I really can't predict.

2500|$|Marriage {{played a}} large role in the lives of Puritan women. In Bradstreet's poem, [...] "To My Dear And Loving Husband," [...] she reveals that she is one with her husband. [...] "If ever two were one, then surely we." [...] The Puritans {{believed}} that since marriage is ordained by God, then it is a gift from God. [...] She loves her gift so much that through the use of her poetry, she is able to express her love for God's gift to her husband. In another of Bradstreet's works, [...] "Before the Birth of One of Her Children", Bradstreet acknowledges God's gift of marriage. In the lines, [...] "And if I see not <b>half</b> <b>my</b> days that's due, what nature would, God grant to yours, and you;" [...] Bradstreet is saying that if she was to die soon, what would God give her husband. She could be referring to him possibly remarrying after she dies. [...] Another line shows that she believes that it is possible for her husband to remarry. By using the lines, [...] "These O protect from stepdame's injury", Bradstreet is calling for her children to be protected from the abuse of a future step mother. The fact that Bradstreet believes that God will grant her husband with a new wife if she dies shows how much Puritan women believed in marriage and how God provided them with this gift.|$|E

2500|$|Sackville-West {{called for}} a [...] "spirit of candor" [...] in society that would allow for {{tolerance}} of gay and bisexual people as an [...] "inevitable evil". Much influenced by the theories promoted by sexologists like Magnus Hirschfeld, Edward Carpenter, Richard von Krafft-Ebing, Havelock Ellis and Sigmund Freud, Sackville-West presented her sexuality as abnormal and wrong and due to some psychological flaw she was born with, portraying heterosexuality as the norm that she wanted, but {{failed to live up}} to. Several times, Sackville-West stated that she wrote Portrait of a Marriage for scientific purposes so people would be able to understand bisexual people, which would [...] thus allow her, despite her self-condemnation, to present her sexuality as in some way normal. Several of the sexologists Sackville-West cited, most notably Carpenter and Ellis, had argued that homosexuality and bisexuality were in fact normal, and despite her condemning herself, her use of a [...] "scientific" [...] approach backed up with quotes from Ellis and Carpenter allowed her to present her bisexuality as implicitly normal. Writing in the third person, Sackville-West declared [...] "she regrets that the person Harold married wasn't entirely and wholly what he had thought of her, and that the person who loves and owns Violet isn't a second person, because each suits each other". Sackville-West presented her sexuality as part of the personality she had been born with, portraying herself as an accursed woman who should be the object of sympathy, not condemnation. Even in 1973, when her son Nigel Nicolson published Portrait of a Marriage, he was uncertain {{if he was going to}} be charged with obscenity or not, going to considerable lengths to stress the legitimacy of a love for a person of the same sex in his introduction. Despite portraying herself as some way [...] "deviant" [...] because of her feelings for women, Sackville-West also wrote in Portrait of a Marriage of the discovery and acceptance of her bisexuality as a teenager as the joyous [...] "liberation of <b>half</b> <b>my</b> personality", suggesting that she did not really see herself as a woman with [...] "deviant" [...] sexuality, as this statement contradicted what she had written at the beginning of the book about her [...] "perverted" [...] sexuality. Johnson wrote that Sackville-West, in presenting the lesbian side of herself in terms that depicted Trefusis as evil and Nicolson as good, was the only way possible at the time to express this side of her personality, writing [...] "even if annihilating herself seemed the only way she could present any type of acceptable self." ...|$|E
