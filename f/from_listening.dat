After moving to another village, {{he lived with his}} grandfather, Moola Singh Bains, who had {{established}} a primary school. Dosanjh gained an early interest in politics <b>from</b> <b>listening</b> to debates between his father, a follower of Jawaharlal Nehru and the populist Indian National Congress, and his grandfather, a former Indian freedom fighter and socialist. Dosanjh wanted to pursue an education in political science, but his father wanted him to be a doctor. So in 1964, at the age of 17, Dosanjh left India for the United Kingdom where he could pursue his own interests. In London he learned English and worked as an assistant editor for a Punjabi-language newspaper. He emigrated to Canada {{three and a half years}} later, arriving in British Columbia on May 12, 1968, to live with his aunt. majoring in political science.

25|$|Radio Luxembourg {{was one of}} few {{channels}} {{through which}} {{people living in the}} Eastern Bloc could listen to rock and other contemporary popular music. Under good weather conditions, and especially at night, people as far as eastern Czechoslovakia and Estonia could listen to the station. Eastern Bloc governments did not use jammers to prevent people <b>from</b> <b>listening</b> to Radio Luxembourg, but did do so for Radio Free Europe and, since the stations used harmonic frequencies (1439kHz for Luxembourg and 719kHz for Free Europe), the jamming also affected Radio Luxembourg's signal. Even though western popular music was considered undesirable by socialist regimes, legal prosecution was rare, although not unheard of. The music appealed to young people as something forbidden, and listening to it became a social ritual. It also strongly influenced contemporary underground culture and music in Czechoslovakia.|$|E
25|$|As {{the rebels}} in al-Yaarubiyah were forced on the defensive, Ahrar al-Jazeera {{fell out of}} favor with the other rebel groups, and was {{forcibly}} expelled from the town on charges that it was corrupt. As result, al-Yaarubiyah was left {{under the control of}} four Jihadi groups by October 2013: The al-Nusra Front, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, Ansar al-Khilafa, and Liwa al-Tawhid wa al-Jihad. Their rule was harsh, as locals were forbidden <b>from</b> <b>listening</b> to music and forced to fast and pray, while dissidents were either imprisoned or beheaded. Food prices increased and fuel became scarce. In response to these policies and the fighting in the area, most of the town's population fled to YPG territories. Eventually, a delegation of 90 leading tribesmen from al-Yaarubiyah asked the YPG to drive the rebels from the town, to which the militia responded positively.|$|E
25|$|If a firstborn {{attending}} a siyum does {{not hear the}} completion of the tractate, or if he does not understand what he hears, or if he is in the shiva period of mourning and is thus forbidden <b>from</b> <b>listening</b> to the Torah material being taught, some authorities rule that subsequent eating would not qualify as a seudat mitzvah and he would therefore be forbidden to break his fast (Ben Ish Chai 1:96:25; Rabbi Shlomo Yosef Elyashiv, Siddur Pesach K'hilchaso, p.168; Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Chazon Ovadiah, p.99). Other authorities allow a firstborn to break his fast under such circumstances (Minchas Yitzchak 9:45; Teshuvos V'hanhagos 1:300, 2:210 in the name of Rabbi Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky). The Minchas Yitzchak (ibid.) suggests that a firstborn in such a position should at least try to contribute to the siyum in some way, such as by sponsoring or helping to prepare the meal.|$|E

25|$|During the {{campaign}} in Greece under Glabrio, Plutarch's account (albeit rejected by historian Wilhelm Drumann) suggests that before the Battle of Thermopylae, Cato was chosen to prevent Corinth, Patrae, and Aegium from siding with Antiochus. During this period, Cato visited Athens where, in trying to prevent the Athenians <b>from</b> <b>listening</b> to the propositions of the Seleucid king, Cato addressed them in a Latin speech, which required an interpreter to be understood by the audience. Whether this was out of necessity or merely a choice by Cato remains unclear, however, since the assertion that he might very well have already known Greek at the time {{can be made from}} anecdotal evidence. For example, Plutarch said that while at Tarentum in his youth he had developed a close friendship with Nearchus, who was himself a Greek philosopher. Similarly, Aurelius Victor stated he had received instruction in Greek from Ennius while praetor in Sardinia. Nevertheless, because his speech was an affair of state, it is probable that he complied with the Roman norms of the day in using the Latin language, which compliance was considered in diplomacy as a mark of Roman dignity.|$|E

Jean originally sketched each individual artwork for The Hunting Party in a personal sketchbook, where it felt more intimate and less precious to Jean.

[...] He said the main {{difference is that the}} musical is, [...] "at its core, about two young men who come from seemingly opposite worlds who figure out that they have a lot in common, beginning with the need to stand up to their dads." [...] Lauper's inspirations ranged <b>from</b> <b>listening</b> as a child to her parents' recordings of South Pacific and West Side Story, as well as musical inspirations as diverse as Aaron Copland's [...] "Appalachian Spring" [...] and pop singer Lana Del Rey.
