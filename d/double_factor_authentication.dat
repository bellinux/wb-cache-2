Two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> provides much stronger authentication than simply username and password authentication. One {{of the most popular}} two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> involves hardware tokens that enable constantly changing session strings at set intervals. In this method to authenticate users, a password presented and used with these constantly changing strings. However, Sophisticated attacks can steal session id even within the shortest window opportunity. But besides authenticating session, if the transaction is authenticated before it is completed with one time password, the hijacker can be thwarted. The success of the two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> depends on encryption strategies and application logic. We discuss the effectiveness of two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> for preventing fraudulent transactions during session hijacking attacks on online business...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Single <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> such as {{password}} authentication is {{no longer}} considered as secure in the Internet world. There is a rapid growth in demand for strong authentication on the highly critical web-based applications. A higher level security mechanism is needed to access the financial and banking applications. Existing system provides authentication mechanism based on the static password, personal identification number (PIN) etc. These methods are vulnerable against eavesdropping and replay attack. In this work, a two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> scheme is proposed for user authentication. The presented scheme generates dynamic password for two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication.</b> This scheme will provide user assurance of authentication and will improve authentication level. The proposed scheme provides strong protection against cryptanalysis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: There {{are several}} systems {{for dealing with}} two way mobile {{authentication}} which may differ in delivering the password to the authorized user or a different entity based on the security constraints. One of the disadvantage of the one <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> systems is {{the ease with which}} they can be cracked. This threat has increased over time as new and modern methods can be used for guessing and cracking authentication systems. The need for better and more secure systems has given rise to the concept of the two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> system. In system mentioned here, two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> for android client is provided. Android client is accessing different resources such as users files in a network. One factor is username and password which user gets when they become user of active directory and the second factor is OTP which is generated at client side and encrypted using RSA algorithm and at server side it is decrypted using same algorithm. OAuth is used to authorize the android client and providing it limited access in network. Client gets access token and only by using that client can access user’s resources...|$|R

A further enhancement {{to this type}} of authentication is to add a fourth factor thereby providing a four <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> [21]. The fourth factor can be the addition of location of the user – someplace the user is. The military data sharing requirements take into consideration the place in which the user is positioned so as to find the location of any valid/invalid user. So, the sensitive areas of application require security with some amount of privacy preservation. Section three gives an overview of the existing authentication systems in grid computing.

40|$|The ever {{increasing}} use of internet around the world has without doubt increased the usage of internet based services, e-business models, easier ways of communication and information sharing. Such drastic increase in usage of network based systems has made the current cyber security systems old dated as the hackers and attackers of networked systems {{is on the rise}} with new and modern attack methodologies. This has necessitated the need of more secure ways of communications. The issues of Confidentiality, Integrity and the Availability of systems are of prime importance and more research towards these issues has been called for around the world. One of the major areas of security improvement {{is the way in which}} authentication of users is carried out. Even though many organizations still rely on static ID and password authentication system, this method is getting old and there is a requirement for a better way of authentication which is required. One of the solutions for this issue is the two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> technique as a fundamental security function. Our thesis proposal explores the two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> technique and implementation issues which can be used for the two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> technique. Two-factor authentication method is implemented in two main phases. In the first phase, the authenticator gets a request generated by the application to authenticate a specified user. When the request is received, it generates a one-time password and sends it through a SMS to a GSM cell phone registered for that specified user. The one-time password has a default timeout 5 minutes which is configurable. In the second phase of the authentication, a request is sent with the user id and a hash of the one-time password. If both the one-time and user specified password is valid then the user will be authenticated. [1] It proposes a secure, convenient and user friendly two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> scheme and discusses its applications to online banking.

40|$|Abstract-Phishing is {{an attempt}} to commit fraud via social engineering. The impact is the breach of {{information}} security through the compromise of confidential data. Customers can access their banking accounts from anywhere in the world using their login ID and password. However, the use of password does not provide adequate protection against Internet fraud such as phishing. Phishing exploits this vulnerability to fraudulently acquire sensitive personal information, such as username, passwords and/or credit card details. Usually this is achieved by masquerading as a trustworthy person or business with an apparently legitimate request for information. In this paper we have proposed a new approach named as IAPC which includes captcha followed by two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication.</b> Two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> is carried out using steganography mechanism to hide the password inside an image.

40|$|Nowadays, web {{authentication}} is {{the main}} and important measure which guarantees the information security and data privacy. Web authentication provides the basis of user accessibility and data security. In the last few years, frequent outbreaks in the password databases lead to a main concern in the data security. The default method for the web authentication is password only mechanism. There are many security {{problems associated with the}} password only approach. Many users have a tendency to reuse the same password in different websites. So when one password is being compromised, it may lead to the password break of the other websites due to the password reuse. In order to improve the security, Two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> (TFA) is strongly recommended. But despite of this, TFA has not been widely accepted in the web authentication mechanism. Due to the high scale and drastic popularity of the mobile phone and an inbuilt function of the barcode scanning through camera lead to a new two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> method. In this paper, the proposed two <b>factor</b> <b>authentication</b> protocol uses mobile phone with one or more camera as the second <b>factor</b> for the <b>authentication.</b> The proposed TFA in web authentication counter various attacks such as man in the middle attack (MITM), phishing attacks and so on. Here password is the first factor and mobile is used as the second factor for the web authentication. The communication between the mobile phone and the PC is with the help of visible light. Visible light communication has many advantages as compared with other communication mechanisms. There is a less cellular cost in this scheme which indicates the user does not need cellular network or Wi-Fi for the authentication...|$|R
