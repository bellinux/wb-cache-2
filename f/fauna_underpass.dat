The Compton Road fauna overpass is the most intensively studied in the country. [...] It links the forest to the northern Kuraby bushland.

40|$|AbstractThe {{ecological}} impact of roads and traffic is now widely acknowledged, {{with a variety}} of mitigation strategies such as purpose designed <b>fauna</b> <b>underpasses</b> and overpasses commonly installed to facilitate animal movement. Despite often being designed for larger mammals, crossing structures appear to enable safe crossings for a range of smaller, ground dwelling species that exhibit high vulnerability to roads. Less {{attention has been paid to}} the extent to which fauna overpasses function as habitat in their own right, an issue particularly relevant to reptiles and amphibians. The Compton Road fauna array (Brisbane, Australia) includes a vegetated fauna overpass which connects two urban forest reserves and traverses a major four lane arterial road. The aim of this study was to quantify the extent to which colonisation of the Compton Road fauna overpass by reptile and amphibian species living in adjacent forests occurred. Pitfall sampling at seven sampling sites occurred between June 2005 and February 2010, starting approximately six months after overpass construction, with additional observational detections throughout this period. The overpass yielded higher species diversity and capture rates compared with the forest areas. Species accumulation curves demonstrated a strong and consistent colonisation rate of the overpass throughout the six year monitoring period, while persistent occupation by species on the overpass throughout the six years suggests permanent colonisation of the vegetated structure as an extension of the natural forest habitat. These outcomes demonstrate that the fauna overpass at Compton Road provides suitable habitat for diverse local herpetofauna communities and suggest enhanced habitat connectivity across the road...|$|R
40|$|Four large underpasses, {{specifically}} designed for movements by fauna, form part of a major road upgrade project on the Atherton Tablelands in northeast Queensland, Australia. We describe the design and rationale of a project to test their effectiveness in restoring habitat continuity for tropical rainforest fauna. The large blocks of upland rain¬forest divided by the road are recognized for their high faunal conservation significance, forming habitat for many rare or threatened species. Ecologists, road engineers and the Atherton Tablelands conservation community have united with a common conservation goal: to design the ‘furniture’ within the underpasses and accomplish rainforest revegeta¬tion to provide protective cover and attract <b>fauna</b> to <b>underpass</b> entrances. Prior to con¬struction, small mammals were trapped weekly for several months in habitats close to the road upgrade. The small mammal community comprised grassland species in abandoned pasture and differed significantly from the rainforest specialists found in three closed canopy habitats: rainforest edge, rainforest interior and Lantana shrubland. Rainforest restoration works designed to restore connectivity for rainforest fauna across this aban¬doned pastureland (via the underpasses to major rainforest blocks {{to the north and}} south of the road) are currently in progress. Monitoring of the effectiveness of the underpasses in allowing faunal movements will involve the use of infra-red-triggered cameras within the underpasses and near underpass entrances, and a survey of road-killed fauna both prior to and postconstruction. Further examination of small mammal community structure and movements, with respect to both the new road and the underpasses, will be undertaken once rainforest plantings have become established. This evaluation should provide insights for further road-associated restoration projects in rainforest regions...|$|R
