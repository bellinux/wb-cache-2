In {{the majority of}} cases, the individual ulcers last about 7–10 days, and ulceration episodes occur 3–6 times per year. Most appear on the non-keratinizing epithelial surfaces in the mouth (i.e. anywhere except the attached gingiva, the hard palate and the dorsum of the tongue), although the more severe forms, which are less common, may also involve keratinizing epithelial surfaces. Symptoms range from a minor nuisance to interfering with <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> <b>drinking.</b> The severe forms may be debilitating, even causing weight loss due to malnutrition.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the motivations underlying binge <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> binge <b>drinking</b> {{in a sample of}} 302 adolescents. Our findings showed that binge eating was significantly correlated with gender, environmental, emotional, <b>and</b> social <b>eating.</b> Hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated that emotional <b>and</b> environmental <b>eating</b> were significant positive predictors of binge eating, whereas binge drinking was significantly correlated with enhancement, social, and coping motives. Only enhancement motives were significant predictors of binge drinking. Our results support the argument that the reasons underlying binge <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> binge <b>drinking</b> in adolescents may be similar and may perform the same function...|$|R

5|$|By the 18th century, Mersea Fort was in ruins. The fishery {{rules were}} {{reinforced}} by fresh legislation in 1758, which created {{a court of}} conservancy to oversea the oyster stocks. Officially, this court was supposed {{to sit at the}} fort, but rather than using the now dilapidated earthworks, it began to meet in Colchester's Moot Hall. Instead, a ceremony began to take place each year at the Mersea Stone, near to the fort, involving local dignitaries and extensive <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> <b>drinking.</b> The fort was recommissioned during the Napoleonic Wars {{at the start of the}} 19th century, and a new gun battery was constructed overlooking the sea, equipped with six 24-pounder (10.9kg) guns. After this the fort was abandoned once again. A sea wall was built along the coast early in the century, cutting through the south-east side of the fort. The legislation on oysters was reformed by Parliament in 1870, which disbanded the previous court structure and severed the historic link with Mersea Fort. A defensive pill-box was constructed at the castle during the Second World War.|$|E

40|$|Evidence of an {{association}} between binge <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> binge <b>drinking</b> <b>and</b> of related health consequences have stimulated investigators to examine and explore risk and protective factors plus the reasons why individuals engage in these risky behaviours (Benjamin & Wulfert, 2003; Ferriter & Ray, 2011). This study {{examined the relationship between}} binge <b>drinking</b> <b>and</b> <b>eating,</b> time perspective <b>and</b> psychological functioning. A cross-sectional survey of 1350 17 - 19 year-old adolescents was conducted. Findings suggested that adolescents engaged in both binge <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> binge <b>drinking</b> behaviours reported negative experiences in the past, and they showed a lower future orientation and a greater inclination to fatalism than did the other students Additionally, {{they were more likely to}} report lower feelings of satisfaction with life and self-esteem than the others. The pattern of results allows to conclude that time perspective may be a salient dimension when exploring the psychosocial correlates of binge behaviours, particularly within adolescents. © 2012 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents...|$|R
