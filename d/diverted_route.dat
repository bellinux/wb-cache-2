40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to provide a better {{understanding}} of the impacts of route guidance on urban arterials and networks controlled by traffic signals. Control and timing strategies to handle diverted traffic from the freeways to surface streets were developed and tested through simulation on real-life networks.

50|$|The village {{history is}} quite recent {{due to the}} fact of the Horton Kirby paper mill {{originally}} built in 1820 by Henry Hall. Before the mills {{there were only a few}} farms and some small cottages for workers including a forge. The mill was first a flour mill less than half of the size of the mill today and employed a handful of local people. Some years later the mill was converted into a paper making mill which took up a much larger area, and also gave way to a small tunnel which gave a <b>diverted</b> <b>route</b> for the river darent which runs through the site. The paper produced was said to be a good quality, used for magazines an copying plans.Towards the end of the 19th century the mill was expanding with a boiler house and the iconic chimney built in 1881. The chimney is Grade 2 listed, as well as 2 other listed buildings (workhouses) in the site, one now the local co-operative Food. In 1918 an extra 70 ft of circular Stock was added to the chimney made of mostly red brick to ensure that emissions escaped from the valley. Houses were needed for the workers, so small terraced houses were built (mill cottages and the bottom half of new road.) The mill later closed fully in February 2003.|$|E

The describedchemical route relies on the utilization of a “macrocycle transporter”, which is able first to bind amacrocycle, second to link temporarily a triazolium-containing molecular axle, and third to deliverthe macrocycle around the new docked axle through molecular machinery in a [1]rotaxane structure.

50|$|On 10 August 1992 {{a special}} service, 51P, was started, from Shek Kong {{swimming}} pool to Tsuen Wan. In 1996 KMB assigned two air-conditioned Dennis Dart buses (AA) fitted with manual decelerators to Route 51. In {{the same year}} the District Councils of Tsuen Wan and Yuen Long planned to <b>divert</b> <b>Route</b> 51 to Tai Lam Tunnel once it had been completed with terminus relocated to Sheung Tsuen via Kam Sheung Road, but to avoid loss of bus service on Route Twisk, KMB ended up creating a new route numbered 251M.

40|$|I present {{design and}} {{implementation}} of a logistic solution for automated warehouses. I modeled warehouses with weighted directed graphs, on which I use Dijkstra's search algorithm. This design enables implementation of an universal solution for moving transport units and goods {{in and out of}} the warehouse. I show balancing of the system activities by allocating work to various material sub-systems. The system supports dynamic rerouting based on host and other requirements and automatically finds <b>diverting</b> <b>routes</b> in case of sub-system failures. Software architecture to achieve reliability and robustness for 24 / 7 working environment and the value of experience and feedback on the software evolution are additionally demonstrated. The application is developed in Java and PL/SQL programming languages and runs on Oracle database. Today, this application runs in more then 50 automatic warehouses in western Europe...|$|R

40|$|The United States Navy Meteorology and Oceanography (METOC) {{community}} routes ships for weather evasion using advanced meteorological {{modeling and}} satellite data, but lacks {{a tool to}} enable fewer ship routers to make better routing decisions faster. Limited resources and rising costs are impacting the frequency and duration of current naval operations. The Commander, Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command has ordered the community to find efficiencies and automation possibilities {{in order to meet}} lower manning levels, reduce waste, and increase savings. Outside of the Navy, Ocean Systems Incorporated in Alameda, CA developed the Ship Tracking and Routing System (STARS) software package to calculate optimum sea routes based on weather model data. However, METOC ship routers are reluctant to adopt this complex software. To help solve this, we modeled Optimum Track Ship Routing (OTSR) for U. S. Navy warships using a network graph of the Western Pacific Ocean. A binary heap version of Dijkstra's algorithm determines the optimum route given model generated wind and seas input. We test the model against recent weather data to verify the model's performance, and to historical <b>divert</b> <b>route</b> recommendations in order to validate against routes developed by OTSR personnel...|$|R
