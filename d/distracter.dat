40|$|Emotional <b>distracters</b> impair {{cognitive}} function. Emotional processing is dysregulated in {{affective disorders}} such as depression, phobias, schizophrenia, and PTSD. Among the processes impaired by emotional <b>distracters,</b> and whose dysregulation is documented in affective disorders, {{is the ability to}} time in the seconds-to-minutes range, i. e. interval timing. Presentation of task-irrelevant <b>distracters</b> during a timing task results in a delay in responding suggesting a failure to maintain subjective time in working memory, possibly due to attentional and working memory resources being diverted away from timing, as proposed by the Relative Time-Sharing model. We investigated the role of the prelimbic cortex in the detrimental effect of anxiety-inducing task-irrelevant <b>distracters</b> on the cognitive ability to keep track of time, using local infusions of norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor nomifensine in a modified peak-interval procedure with neutral and anxiety-inducing <b>distracters.</b> Given that some antidepressants have beneficial effects on attention and working memory, e. g., decreasing emotional response to negative events, we hypothesized that nomifensine would improve maintenance of information in working memory in trials with <b>distracters,</b> resulting in a decrease of the disruptive effect of emotional events on the timekeeping abilities. Our results revealed a dissociation of the effects of nomifensine infusion in prelimbic cortex between interval timing and resource allocation, and between neutral and anxiety-inducing distraction. Nomifensine was effective only during trials with <b>distracters,</b> but not during trials without <b>distracters.</b> Nomifensine reduced the detrimental effect of the <b>distracters</b> only when the <b>distracters</b> were anxiety-inducing, but not when they were neutral.

The mechanism by which DLPFC might ensure successful maintenance of the contents of WM is, however, unclear; it might enhance neural maintenance of memory targets or suppress processing of <b>distracters.</b> To adjudicate between these possibilities, we applied time-locked transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during functional MRI, an approach that permits causal assessment of a stimulated brain region's influence on connected brain regions, and evaluated how this influence may change under different task conditions. Participants performed a visual WM task requiring retention of visual stimuli (faces or houses) across a delay during which visual <b>distracters</b> could be present or absent. When <b>distracters</b> were present, they were always from the opposite stimulus category, so that targets and <b>distracters</b> were represented in distinct posterior cortical areas. We then measured whether DLPFC-TMS, administered in the delay at the time point when <b>distracters</b> could appear, would modulate posterior regions representing memory targets or <b>distracters.</b> We found that DLPFC-TMS influenced posterior areas only when <b>distracters</b> were present and, critically, that this influence consisted of increased activity in regions representing the current memory targets. DLPFC-TMS did not affect regions representing current <b>distracters.</b> These results provide a new line of causal evidence for a top-down DLPFC-based control mechanism that promotes successful maintenance of relevant information in WM in the presence of distraction...|$|R

OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the effects of hearing impairment and distractibility on older people's driving ability, assessed under real-world conditions. DESIGN: Experimental cross-sectional study. SETTING: University laboratory setting and an on-road driving test. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred seven community-living adults aged 62 to 88. Fifty-five percent had normal hearing, 26 % had a mild hearing impairment, and 19 % had a moderate or greater impairment. MEASUREMENTS: Hearing was assessed using objective impairment measures (pure-tone audiometry, speech perception testing) and a self-report measure (Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly). Driving was assessed on a closed road circuit under three conditions: no <b>distracters,</b> auditory <b>distracters,</b> and visual <b>distracters.</b> RESULTS: There was a significant interaction between hearing impairment and <b>distracters,</b> such that people with moderate to severe hearing impairment had significantly poorer driving performance {{in the presence of}} <b>distracters</b> than those with normal or mild hearing impairment.

40|$|AbstractHuman {{judgment}} is frequently impaired by <b>distracters</b> extending across our field of view. How we extract relevant {{information from a}} spatially restricted region in a complex scene {{in spite of this}} impairment is an important issue in vision. Recently, {{it has been shown that}} this impairment can be reduced by increasing the number of surrounding <b>distracters</b> without changing the density, thus increasing the total area covered by the <b>distracters.</b> Little, however, is known regarding the underlying mechanism(s). Here, we tested the hypothesis that visual impairment by <b>distracters</b> is due to integration of irrelevant information across space, and that further addition of <b>distracters</b> produces contraction of the spatial integration field. Human subjects were instructed to judge the direction of motion within a center disk and to ignore motion noise in the surrounding annulus in a random dot kinematogram. We observed a non-monotonic effect of the size of the annulus, in which the subjects’ discrimination thresholds at first increased, and then decreased as the size of the annulus became larger. We further investigated how weak coherent motion in the surrounding annulus interferes with the subjects’ performance. Importantly, we found that the amount of interference decreases with the addition of surrounding motion noise, consistent with the hypothesis that the addition of <b>distracters</b> produces contraction of the range of spatial integration. Our results suggest that integration within a visual receptive field causes impairment by <b>distracters</b> across our visual field, and that contraction of the range of integration can counteract this impairment...|$|R

5000|$|A {{study by}} Wickham & Swift [...] {{looks at the}} role that articulatory {{suppression}} can have on verbal overshadowing and face identification. Verbal overshadowing is the phenomenon that verbally describing a face between presentation and test can impair identification of the face (Schooler & Engstler-Schooler, 1990). This study had the goal of looking to see how important verbal encoding is to face recognition and also how it interacts with verbal overshadowing by using articulatory suppression to force the individual to rely on their visual code instead of the phonological code. Participants were asked to perform a procedure that included studying a face carefully for five seconds. During these five seconds, they were repeating the word ‘the’. Then, participants were either given one minute to write down {{a description of the}} face they just saw or were given a crossword puzzle to complete to distract them. Then, participants were shown ten faces, of which there were nine faces that were very similar and one face that was considered the target, or the one they just studied. This procedure was repeated twelve times for each participant. Researchers found several interesting conclusions from their study. First, they found that that “articulatory suppression significantly reduced the identification scores of no description participants but not the description participants.” This means that articulatory suppression has an effect on facial identification in that it impairs one’s ability to recognize a face. Interestingly, this study also found that when participants were using articulatory suppression, the verbal overshadowing effect did not occur. This would seem to suggest that the encoding of faces and the verbal overshadowing effect comes from a problem with the verbal code, not the visual code. Because having that <b>distracter</b> syllable did not hinder the individual’s ability to recognize the face more than describing it did, {{it would not be a}} problem with disrupting what the participants encoded visually, but the verbal aspects that interferes and creates the verbal overshadowing effect.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the main}} {{objective}} of this implicit test is to assess priming effects, the WFC assessment is typically administered after a presentation period of the to-be-tested words. Subjects are typically presented with the items as read directly from a list by a test administrator or by the participants themselves. To ensure that implicit memory is being measured rather than explicit memory, participants can be given irrelevant tasks in this stage to distract them from attempting to memorize the to-be-tested words (E.g. Sort various squares by size). Participants in research studies often try to determine the experimenters' goals and respond in ways which would support their hypotheses, which makes <b>distracter</b> tasks crucial to the validity of studies. Another step to ensure participants are not relying on explicit memory is to place a time delay between the learning phase and the test phase. This interferes with primacy and recency effects because it interrupts the active rehearsal of the listed items.After being exposed to the items (learning phase), the participants enter the test phase. They are presented with fragments of the words that were shown in the learning phase, in addition to new words that serve as a baseline of performance (i.e. performance on non-primed words). Participants are then instructed to complete the fragments with the first word that comes to mind. Priming effects are evident when performance on the originally presented words exceeds performance on the new words. The types of words that are presented are typically ones that are used infrequently in everyday language. Words that are lower in frequency {{are more likely to}} be identified correctly in the WFC test because they are more distinct, which makes them easier to recall. Presented words also tend to be longer (7 or 8 characters) than words presented in other implicit memory tests and the fragments are presented in such a way that only 1 or 2 possibilities for completion exist.|$|E

Experiment 1 demonstrated that an increase in focal task-engagement—promoted experimentally by reducing the perceptual discriminability of the visual target-words—eliminated the disruption by such <b>distracters</b> of veridical recall and also attenuated the erroneous recall of the <b>distracters.</b> A recall instruction that eliminates the requirement for output-monitoring was used in Experiment 2 to investigate whether increased task-engagement shields against distraction through a change in output-monitoring processes (back-end control) or by affecting the processing of the <b>distracters</b> during their presentation (front-end control). Rates of erroneous distracter-recall were much greater than in Experiment 1 but both erroneous distracter-recall and the disruptive effect of <b>distracters</b> on veridical recall were still attenuated under reduced target-word discriminability.

40|$|Selective {{attention}} {{is critical for}} controlling the input to mental processes. Attentional mechanisms act not only to select relevant stimuli but also to exclude irrelevant stimuli. There is evidence that we can actively ignore irrelevant information. We measured neural activity relating to successfully ignoring <b>distracters</b> (using preview search) and found increases in both the precuneus and primary visual cortex during preparation to ignore <b>distracters.</b> We also found reductions in activity in fronto-parietal regions while previewing <b>distracters</b> {{and a reduction in}} activity in early visual cortex during search when a subset of items was successfully excluded from search, both associated with precuneus activity. These results are consistent with the proposal that actively excluding distractions has two components: an initial stage where <b>distracters</b> are encoded, and a subsequent stage where further processing of these items is inhibited. Our findings suggest that it is the precuneus that controls this process and can modulate activity in visual cortex as early as V 1...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. The driving {{environment}} {{is becoming increasingly}} complex, including both visual and auditory distractions within the in- vehicle and external driving environments. This {{study was designed to}} investigate the effect of visual and auditory distractions on a performance measure that {{has been shown to be}} related to driving safety, the useful field of view. METHODS. A laboratory study recorded the useful field of view in 28 young visually normal adults (mean 22. 6 +/- 2. 2 years). The useful field of view was measured in the presence and absence of visual <b>distracters</b> (of the same angular subtense as the target) and with three levels of auditory distraction (none, listening only, listening and responding). RESULTS. Central errors increased significantly (P < 0. 05) in the presence of auditory but not visual <b>distracters,</b> while peripheral errors increased in the presence of both visual and auditory <b>distracters.</b> Peripheral errors increased with eccentricity and were greatest in the inferior region in the presence of <b>distracters.</b> CONCLUSIONS. Visual and auditory <b>distracters</b> reduce the extent of the useful field of view, and these effects are exacerbated in inferior and peripheral locations. This result has significant ramifications for road safety in an increasingly complex in-vehicle and driving environment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-This work {{presents}} {{evidence for}} a second stage of spatial filtering in early vision. This second stage operates on {{the output of the}} well known linear spatial filters and integrates their thresholded responses with a center-surround weighting function. The evidence for the existence of this second stage comes from experiments where observers have to detect a Gabor signal with known parameters (target) among a varied number of other Gabor signals having orthogonal orientation (<b>distracters).</b> Detection performance on this task depends on the number of <b>distracters</b> and the distance between them: when the number of <b>distracters</b> is small performance deteriorates with an increasing number of distracters; however, when the number of <b>distracters</b> becomes larger performance improves with an increasing number of <b>distracters.</b> This improvement depends on the spatial-frequency of the signals and their spatial separation. Best performance is achieved when the spatial separation between signals is larger than three times their center wavelength but smaller than nine times their wavelength, implying a second stage filtering with a center size of six wavelengths and a total size of 18 wavelengths. This second stage of filtering may underlie our ability to detect certain texture boundaries preatentively. Visual search Parallel processing Spatial filters Attention Textur...|$|R
