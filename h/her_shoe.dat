5|$|In {{the next}} match, Sensational Sherri stood at ringside as Shawn Michaels defended his Intercontinental Championship against Marty Jannetty. She {{did not reveal}} her {{allegiance}} to either man. Jannetty gained the early advantage, knocking Michaels {{out of the ring}} and diving onto him through the ropes. He then attacked Michaels by jumping off the top rope, but Michaels countering this move by hitting him on the way down. Michaels hit Jannetty's shoulder against the ring post and focused on wearing down the shoulder once both men had re-entered the ring. Michaels missed an attack from the top rope, which allowed Jannetty to punch him repeatedly. Michaels recovered and threw Jannetty out of the ring, but Jannetty then suplexed Michaels over the rope and onto the arena floor. Sherri turned on Michaels by slapping him in the face, and Jannetty threw Michaels back into the ring with a belly-to-back suplex. Jannetty performed a powerslam and a DDT on Michaels. Michaels attempted to punch Jannetty but knocked the referee unconscious instead. Sherri came into the ring and tried to hit Michaels with <b>her</b> <b>shoe.</b> Michaels moved out of the way, and Sherri hit Jannetty instead. When the referee recovered, Michaels performed a superkick on Jannetty and pinned him to retain the championship.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{witnesses}} who were interviewed during the investigation, {{one of the}} fans fell at the lower steps of Stairway 1. According to some reports, it was a young woman, who had lost <b>her</b> <b>shoe</b> on the stairs and stopped, trying to retrieve {{it and put it}} back on. A couple of people also stopped, trying to help the fan in need, but the moving dense crowd on the stairs, limited by metal banisters, promptly crushed them down.

25|$|As {{the men and}} Mimì dine at the cafe, Musetta, {{formerly}} Marcello's sweetheart, {{arrives with}} her rich (and elderly) government minister admirer, Alcindoro, whom she is tormenting. It is clear she has tired of him. To the delight of the Parisians and the embarrassment of her patron, she sings a risqué song (Musetta's waltz: Quando me'n vo'—"When I go along"), hoping to reclaim Marcello's attention. The ploy works; at the same time, Mimì recognizes that Musetta truly loves Marcello. To be rid of Alcindoro for a bit, Musetta pretends to be suffering from a tight shoe and sends him to the shoemaker to get <b>her</b> <b>shoe</b> mended. Alcindoro leaves, and Musetta and Marcello fall rapturously into each other's arms.|$|E

25|$|Prince Charles saw her for {{the first}} time in Eutin in 1770 and remarked that she was pretty. The {{marriage}} was suggested in 1772, and the first ceremony took place in Wismar 21 June 1774: she arrived in Sweden 3 June. She entered Stockholm by gondola 7 June, and the wedding ceremony took place the same night, followed by a masquerade ball in Kungsträdgården. She was noted for her beauty — her waist measured a mere 48cm (19") and <b>her</b> <b>shoe</b> size 31 (girls' size 13) — and, as the marriage of the monarch had not been consummated after nine years, there were hopes that she would provide an heir for the throne.|$|E
25|$|The seventh {{match was}} between Ric Flair, {{accompanied}} by Miss Elizabeth and Woman, and Konnan for the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship. The match started {{at a slow}} pace. Konnan had a slight advantage, applying a side headlock and, later, the surfboard. After a gorilla press slam, Konnan sent Flair to the outside with a clothesline. As Konnan was on the top turnbuckle, Woman shook the ropes, causing him to fall. Flair gained the advantage afterwards. After using an illegal eye poke, Flair distracted the referee, allowing Woman to perform a low blow on Konnan. Konnan came back with punches and backhand chops. Konnan countered a figure four leglock attempt into an inside cradle. Konnan then performed a drop toe-hold and applied the figure four leglock himself, but Flair got to the ropes. After a one-handed bulldog and a rolling thunder lariat, Konnan attempted a pin, but Elizabeth distracted the referee, and Woman hit Konnan with <b>her</b> <b>shoe.</b> Flair then pinned Konnan with both feet on the top rope for leverage to win the match and the title.|$|E

2500|$|At {{a room in}} a Crowdean hotel, Poirot tells Inspector Hardcastle and Colin Lamb what he has deduced. From {{a careful}} chronology, he deduces what Edna realised. She {{returned}} early from lunch {{on the day of}} the murder because <b>her</b> <b>shoe</b> was broken, unnoticed by Miss Martindale, the owner. Miss Martindale took no telephone call at the time she claimed she had, and is the one person with motive to murder Edna. From that fictitious call, the boss sent Sheila to Miss Pebmarsh's house for steno/typing service. Miss Pebmarsh denies requesting this service. Mrs Bland, one of the neighbours, mentioned she had a sister in the initial interview with Hardcastle. Poirot deduced the identity of this sister as Miss Martindale.|$|E

2500|$|The formal beatification of Faustina {{involved}} {{the case of}} Maureen Digan of Massachusetts. In March 1981 Digan reported a healing, while praying at the tomb of Faustina. Digan had suffered from Lymphedema (a disease which causes significant swelling due to fluid retention) for decades, and had undergone ten operations, including a leg amputation. Digan reported that while praying at Faustina's tomb, she heard a voice saying [...] "ask for my help and I will help you" [...] and her constant pain stopped. After two days, Digan reported that her foot - which had previously been too large for <b>her</b> <b>shoe</b> due to her body's liquid retention, was healed. Upon her return to the United States, five Boston area physicians stated that she was healed (with no medical explanation) and the case was declared miraculous by the Vatican in 1992 based on the additional testimony of over 20 witnesses about her prior condition.|$|E

2500|$|Before footbinding was {{practiced in}} China, admiration for small feet already existed as {{demonstrated}} by the Tang dynasty tale of Ye Xian written around 850 by Duan Chengshi. This tale of a girl who lost <b>her</b> <b>shoe</b> and then married a king who sought the owner of the shoe as only her foot was small enough to fit the shoe contains elements of the European story of Cinderella, and is thought to be one of its antecedents. For many, the bound feet were an enhancement to a woman's beauty and made her movement more dainty, [...] and a woman with perfect lotus feet was likely to make a more prestigious marriage. The desirability varies with the size of the feet [...] the perfect bound feet and the most desirable (called [...] "golden lotuses") would be around 3 Chinese inches (around 4 inches (10 cm) in Western measurement) or smaller, while those larger may be called [...] "silver lotuses" [...] (4 Chinese inches) or [...] "iron lotuses" [...] (5 Chinese inches or larger and the least desirable for marriage). The belief that footbinding made women more desirable to men is widely used as an explanation for the spread and persistence of footbinding.|$|E
2500|$|Hercule Poirot {{leaves the}} office of his dentist, Morley, after an {{appointment}}, and notices the arrival of Mabelle Sainsbury Seale. He returns to her the shiny buckle that has fallen from <b>her</b> <b>shoe.</b> Later, he hears from Inspector Japp that Morley has died of a gunshot. Between Poirot's appointment and Morley's death {{there were only three}} patients: Alistair Blunt, a banker; Mabelle Sainsbury Seale; and a Greek secret agent and blackmailer, surnamed Amberiotis. The presence of Blunt, a man thought essential to Britain's economic survival, ensures Japp's involvement in the case. Amberiotis dies of an overdose of anaesthetic and it is thought that the dentist has killed himself after realising the accident for which he had been responsible; but Poirot does not believe this. The movements of people at the dental surgery are inconclusive. Morley's partner, Reilly, seems to have no motive. Morley's secretary had been called away by a fake telegram. Her sleazy boyfriend, Frank Carter, had a weak motive, given that Morley had attempted to dissuade her from seeing him. Also present at the surgery was Howard Raikes, a hard-nosed American left-wing activist, violently opposed to Blunt but enamoured of Blunt's niece, Jane Olivera. Poirot has a long discussion with another patient from that day, a retired civil servant from the Home Office, Mr Barnes, who knows that Amberiotis is a spy, and suspects that Blunt was the actual target of the murder: [...] "They're out after Blunt all right. That I know." ...|$|E
