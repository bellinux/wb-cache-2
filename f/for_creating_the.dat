5|$|A raw 3D {{model of}} Jacob's wolf {{was the basis}} <b>for</b> <b>creating</b> <b>the</b> others. A muscle system, which gave the {{appearance}} of muscles firing and flexing, contributed to this model. From there, the initial fur layout went to painters who were responsible for its color and groom. They also added characteristics, such as wet hair clumping together, and applied it to the fur. They refined this look before passing it off to the lighting and technical directors.|$|E
5|$|Antonucci, an {{advocate}} of hand-drawn animation, wanted to ensure Ed, Edd n Eddy was produced in a way similar to cartoons from the 1940s to 1970s. As a result, the series {{was the last to}} use cel animation; the cels were shipped to Korea <b>for</b> <b>creating</b> <b>the</b> initial animation, and then later edited back at Antonucci's a.k.a. Cartoon studio. The first four seasons were produced traditionally, though the series was forced to switch to digital ink and paint in 2004, starting with Ed, Edd n Eddy's Jingle Jingle Jangle.|$|E

5|$|Erosion acting upon {{different}} types of uplift-created joint and fracture systems is responsible <b>for</b> <b>creating</b> <b>the</b> valleys, canyons, domes, and other features we see today. These joints and fracture systems do not move, and are therefore not faults. Spacing between joints {{is controlled by the}} amount of silica in the granite and granodiorite rocks; more silica tends to create a more resistant rock, resulting in larger spaces between joints and fractures.|$|E
5|$|Gerardus Mercator (5 March 1512– 2 December 1594) was a 16th-century German-Flemish cartographer, {{geographer}} and cosmographer.

5|$|The Dayton Project was a {{research}} and development project {{that was part of}} the larger Manhattan Project to build the first atomic bombs. Work took place at several sites in and around Dayton, Ohio.

The Dayton Project ran from 1943 to 1949, when the Mound Laboratories were completed in nearby Miamisburg, Ohio and the work moved there.|$|E
5|$|The Syndicate's process <b>for</b> <b>creating</b> <b>the</b> Hardy Boys books {{consisted}} {{of creating a}} detailed outline, with all elements of plot; drafting a manuscript; and editing the manuscript.

Beginning in 1934, Stratemeyer's other daughter, Harriet Stratemeyer Adams, began contributing plot outlines; she and Andrew Svenson wrote most of the plot outlines {{for the next several}} decades.

5|$|The {{character}} of Ulysses (in Greek, Odysseus) has been explored widely in literature. The adventures of Odysseus were first recorded in Homer's Iliad and Odyssey (c. 800–700 BC), and Tennyson draws on Homer's narrative in the poem. Most critics, however, find that Tennyson's Ulysses recalls Dante's Ulisse in his Inferno (c. 1320). In Dante's re-telling, Ulisse is condemned to hell among the false counsellors, both for {{his pursuit of}} knowledge beyond human bounds and <b>for</b> <b>creating</b> <b>the</b> deception of the Trojan horse.|$|E

5|$|Curie's {{quest to}} create a new {{laboratory}} did not end with the University of Paris, however. In her later years, she headed the Radium Institute (Institut du radium, now Curie Institute, Institut Curie), a radioactivity laboratory created for her by the Pasteur Institute and the University of Paris. The initiative <b>for</b> <b>creating</b> <b>the</b> Radium Institute had come in 1909 from Pierre Paul Émile Roux, director of the Pasteur Institute, who had been disappointed that the University of Paris was not giving Curie a proper laboratory and had suggested that she move to the Pasteur Institute. Only then, with the threat of Curie leaving, did the University of Paris relent, and eventually the Curie Pavilion became a joint initiative of the University of Paris and the Pasteur Institute.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} at the USDA, Thom became a world {{authority}} on the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium. Thom pioneered the technique of using defined, reproducible culture media to grow microorganisms; most of the taxa he described are still valid today. Together with Margaret B. Church, Thom maintained collections of fungus cultures for the American Type Culture Collection, established in 1925. In 1929, a year after discovering penicillin, Alexander Fleming published a well-known paper in which he identified the mold Penicillium rubrum as the one responsible <b>for</b> <b>creating</b> <b>the</b> drug. Harold Raistrick succeeded in growing the organism on a simple culture medium, but could not isolate the penicillin produced by the mold when grown this way. With Thom's assistance, they correctly identified the organism as Penicillium notatum and, in 1941, developed a method to scale up production at the Department of Agriculture's Northern Regional Research Laboratory in Peoria, Illinois, which ultimately resulted in an inexpensive supply of the drug.|$|E

Before they can depart for Wolfe's lab in New Marais, the Beast attacks Empire City. Cole tries to fight him off, but even his most powerful attack proves useless.

5|$|<b>For</b> <b>creating</b> <b>the</b> {{steam to}} turn steam {{turbines}} and generate electricity, and for cooling the steam coming {{away from the}} turbines, water is needed, and is thus beneficial to have near any thermal power station. The cooling water that {{is used in the}} Lynemouth power station is taken from a body of water located close to the plant, the North Sea. The water is transferred from the sea to the plant by a series of shafts and tunnels. There are three condensers (one per each generating set) in the interior of the power station, which are used to cool the heated water before it is reused in the steam cycle. The cooling water is then transferred back to the North Sea.|$|E
5|$|Henry's reign saw {{significant}} legal changes, {{particularly in}} England and Normandy. By {{the middle of}} the 12th century, England had many different ecclesiastical and civil law courts, with overlapping jurisdictions resulting from the interaction of diverse legal traditions. Henry greatly expanded the role of royal justice in England, producing a more coherent legal system, summarised {{at the end of his}} reign in the treatise of Glanvill, an early legal handbook. Despite these reforms it is uncertain if Henry had a grand vision for his new legal system and the reforms seem to have proceeded in a steady, pragmatic fashion. Indeed, in most cases he was probably not personally responsible <b>for</b> <b>creating</b> <b>the</b> new processes, but he was greatly interested in the law, seeing the delivery of justice as one of the key tasks for a king and carefully appointing good administrators to conduct the reforms.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Hosoda, the team included writer Satoko Okudera and character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, who previously worked with Hosoda on The Girl Who Leapt Through Time. Hiroyuki Aoyama {{served as an}} animation director, while action animation direction was handled by Tatsuzo Nishida. During production, Sadamoto based Wabisuke's design on those of actor Yusaku Matsuda. Aoyama was responsible for supervising the animation {{of the real world}} scenes, while Nishida supervised the animation for the digital world, using both traditional animation and computer animation techniques. Digital animation studio Digital Frontier was responsible <b>for</b> <b>creating</b> <b>the</b> visuals of OZ and its avatars. Youji Takeshige oversaw the art direction for Summer Wars. While visiting Ueda, Hosoda thought that Takeshige, who has previously worked with Studio Ghibli, should draw traditional Japanese houses for the film. The film also features the Japanese spacecraft Hayabusa, whose control center is located in the nearby city of Saku. Hosoda included the spacecraft to support Japan's contribution towards space exploration.|$|E
