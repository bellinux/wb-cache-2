In 1941, {{the association}} raised an additional $70,000, leaving it with total funds on hand of $225,000. By now, {{the total cost}} of completing the structure had risen to $6 million. The GWMNMA agreed to spend $60,000 in 1942 in order to finish the south lodge room on the second floor and dedicate it to the Blue Lodge. The sum also would cover the cost of finishing the room in the southwest corner of the second floor to house the Alexandria-Washington Lodge's Washingtoniana. Five empty lots on Shooter's Hill were also purchased in 1942, so that a large building could not be built next to the memorial. [...] Additionally, the United States Department of Commerce provided, free of charge, equipment for lighting the building and tower as an aid to aviation. [...] The association paid to have the equipment installed. [...] In February 1942, Representative Sol Bloom donated an oil painting of Washington in full Masonic regalia to the memorial that year as well. [...] Bloom was a member of Pacific Lodge No. 233 in the state of New York, and had served as <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Washington</b> Bicentennial Commission.
