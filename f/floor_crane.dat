This has been achieved by minimizing reach of the crane from the floor. The crane is assumed to be cantilever type. Also tension and acceleration in steel ropes are analysed to ensure the safety. The optimized crane successfully passed the various analysing tests which include deflection, bending moment, rope tension and acceleration of the loads in the rope. It also includes another method which provides the virtual user interface for the design engineer. By providing the crane dimensions in the virtual panel, the predefined program automatically creates the CAD modelling in the CAD software. The program is made with visual studio and Solid works macro. Finally, this work reduces the burden on the design engineer and increases the productivity...|$|E
50|$|The {{museum was}} founded as {{a joint effort}} by Pioneers, a Volunteer Network, a {{non-profit}} public service organization, and Don Ostrand and Herb Warrick, both employees of Pacific Northwest Bell. Originally envisioned {{to be one of}} three telephone museums in the Pacific Northwest, this {{was the only one that}} materialized. Work started in 1985, and the museum opened to the public in Fall of 1989. Frames of electromechanical switching equipment were brought in from existing central offices, and lifted to the third <b>floor</b> by <b>cranes.</b> From there, volunteers rewired the equipment to make it functional once again.|$|R
50|$|It {{occupies}} a former machine parts factory in Ottensen, in the Altona district. The building {{dates from the}} Gr√ºnderzeit (around 1840), and consists of a large, nave-like central hall with wooden girders, overlooked by running galleries on the two upper <b>floors.</b> An old <b>crane</b> still hangs over the entrance as a memorial to the building's industrial past.|$|R
5000|$|On December 19, 1985, the 22 story {{commercial}} {{office building}} at 1000 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles, currently {{known as the}} Wedbush Building, experienced a partial collapse of the structure. Construction crews were offloading recently arrived steel girders from a flatbed truck on to {{the deck of the}} newly completed 5th <b>floor</b> via <b>crane</b> when a girder broke loose from the crane and fell down on to the current stockpile below, which was already loaded to twice the maximum designed load capacity of the floor. This initiated a progressive collapse of the overloaded floor, causing the floor section and girders to crash through the 4th, 3rd, 2nd, and 1st floors, finally coming to rest in the parking garage. Three people were killed. The building was a steel-frame design.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} collapsed while shoring {{was being}} removed from newly poured concrete between the 22nd and 23rd {{floors of the}} building, and more concrete was being placed on the 24th <b>floor.</b> A climbing <b>crane</b> on the 24th floor {{fell to the ground}} in the collapse. It was initially falsely assumed that the collapse was related to the fall of the crane. The collapse left a gap 60 ft wide in the building from top to bottom, leaving it looking like two separate buildings.|$|R
50|$|In 1947 an {{enormous}} crane with a 630-ton capacity was completed {{at the site}} by the American Bridge Company. It was the largest crane in the world. This {{was used to remove}} the turrets of battleships so the guns could be quickly replaced while the old set was being refurbished on land. In 1959, a 230-foot tall trapezoidal tower was added {{to the top of the}} crane, bringing its total height to nearly 500 feet. This made the crane the tallest man-made structure in San Francisco until the completion of 44 Montgomery in 1967. The addition was created to facilitate Operation Skycatch, where Polaris missiles were fired and caught via a string of arresting cables, before being lowered to the ground for testing. Previous versions of the test had the missiles flung out into the bay and retrieved from the ocean <b>floor.</b> The <b>crane</b> dominates the landscape in the area as is easily visible from miles around.|$|R
5000|$|Floor mill These have {{a row of}} rotary tables, and a {{horizontal}} pendant spindle mounted {{on a set of}} tracks that runs parallel to the table row. These mills have predominantly been converted to CNC, but some can still be found (if one can even find a used machine available) under manual control. The spindle carriage moves to each individual table, performs the machining operations, and moves to the next table while the previous table is being set up for the next operation. Unlike other mills, floor mills have movable <b>floor</b> units. A <b>crane</b> drops massive rotary tables, X-Y tables, etc., into position for machining, allowing large and complex custom milling operations.|$|R
5000|$|The primary {{structure}} is reinforced concrete. Putzmeister created a new, super high-pressure trailer concrete pump, the BSA 14000 SHP-D, for this project. Burj Khalifa's construction used [...] {{of concrete and}} 55000 t of steel rebar, and construction took 22 million man-hours. In May 2008 Putzmeister pumped concrete with more than 21 MPA ultimate compressive strength of gravel that would surpass the 600 meters weight of the effective area of each column from the foundation to the next fourth level, {{and the rest is}} by metal columns jacketed or covered with concreted to a then world record delivery height of 606 m, the 156th <b>floor.</b> Three tower <b>cranes</b> were used during construction of the uppermost levels, each capable of lifting a 25-tonne load. The remaining structure above is constructed of lighter steel.|$|R
5000|$|Walter {{drafted a}} 7 ft {{drawing of the}} {{aforementioned}} design and displayed it in his office, where it drew the excited attention of members of Congress in 1854. A year later, on March 3, 1855, President Franklin Pierce {{signed off on the}} appropriation of $100,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] ) to build the dome. Construction began after some practical changes to the original design (such as the reduction of the columns from 40 to 36) in September of that year with the removal of the dome raised by Charles Bulfinch. A unique scaffold was built inside the rotunda, designed to keep weight away from the weak center area of the <b>floor,</b> and a <b>crane</b> was set within to run on a steam-powered engine (fueled from the salvaged wood from the old dome).|$|R
5000|$|Soon more {{twists and}} {{troubles}} prevail alongside much fun and comedy moments {{that give the}} whole film a layer of lightheartedness. Shokof explained {{that some of the}} actors had to run {{up and down the stairs}} in order to be ready to act in the next scene and in a different apartment more than 5 times in a single hour to keep the continuity of the scenes intact as they had to shoot without a [...] "cut". The Boxers had to box for over half an hour in their room on the fourth <b>floor</b> before the <b>crane</b> and camera could have reached them after covering other stories from the first floor up and [...] "uncut". the boxers had to remain boxing for almost an hour to keep the film in continuity when the camera finally reached their scene on the fourth floor.|$|R
25|$|The Mark I {{containment}} {{was used}} in those reactors at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant which {{were involved in the}} Fukushima I nuclear accidents. The site suffered from a combination of two beyond design-basis events, a powerful earthquake which may have damaged reactor plumbing and structures and 15 meter tsunami which destroyed fuel tanks, generators and wiring causing back up generators to fail, and battery-powered pumps also eventually failed. Insufficient cooling and failure of pumps needed to restore water lost to boiling off led to partial or possible complete meltdowns of fuel rods which were completely uncovered by water. This led to releases of significant amounts of radioactive material to the air and sea, and hydrogen explosions. However PWR reactors also require years of powered pumped cooling water. The thin secondary containments were not designed to withstand hydrogen explosions, and suffered blown out or destroyed roofs and walls, and destruction of all equipment on the refueling <b>floor</b> including <b>cranes</b> and refueling platform. Unit 3 suffered a particularly spectacular explosion which created a plume of debris over 300m high which resulted in a collapse of {{the north end of the}} top floor, and buckled concrete columns on its west side as can be seen by aerial photographs. Although they were fitted with modified hardened vent systems to vent hydrogen into exhaust stacks, they may have not been effective without power. Unit 2 had a large panel removed to vent gases, but suffered an explosion to the lower suppression area. Even before the Fukushima incident, Mark I containment had been criticized as being more likely to fail during a blackout.|$|R
