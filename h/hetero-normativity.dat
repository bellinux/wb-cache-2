The songs include 1960s-style dance music and [...] "downtown" [...] rhythm and blues. In 1962 Baltimore, Maryland, plump {{teenager}} Tracy Turnblad's dream is to dance on The Corny Collins Show, a local TV dance program based on the real-life Buddy Deane Show. [...] When Tracy wins a role on the show, she becomes a celebrity overnight, and meets a colorful array of characters, leading to social change as Tracy campaigns for the show’s integration, mimicking the activism {{that contributed to the}} integration of its real-life counterpart. Furthermore, Tracy’s acceptance of her figure occurs just prior to the non-fictional 1960s ‘Fat Acceptance Movement’, while Edna’s rejection of <b>hetero-normativity</b> occurs during the non-fictional ‘sexual revolution’. Several lines from the show were 1960s anti-integration slogans. This use of history is crucial to Hairspray: critically, without it Hairspray seems a feeble representation of the social unrest leading to the ‘Civil Rights Act’, however, situated in its historical context, the show becomes highly empowering, inciting nostalgia for older audiences, and showing younger viewers a shocking but hope-inspiring reality.|$|E

My research poesies tracks the cacophony of my theoretical and conceptual evidence and inspiration as I ask {{the central question}} of: How I might go from Shaman to Showoman? Addressing women, sexuality, power and violence my work womanifests through two bodies; the private body of Emma Maye and the public body of Betty Grumble. Betty Grumble is my performative avatar, surreal showgirl, obscene beauty queen and sex clown. She is the canvas for my practice-based research as I inhabit and explode the genres of burlesque and cabaret, performance art and drag. I aim to locate her ethos within feminist performance histories, by mapping her experimentation with and exploration of, her own corporeality. Betty Grumble perforates the boundaries of <b>hetero-normativity’s</b> matrix by displaying her other body through a grotesque and abject burlesquing {{of the status quo}} and the expectations and assumptions it demands of and projects onto the body of woman. By using Betty Grumble as a transmitter of facts, stories and experiences I conceptually Frankenstein her by deconstructing and reassembling the parts that make up her extraordinary avatar whole. My research unpacks her as showoman/shawoman and feminist/sex clown. This text frames my practice as a type of Trojan horse; smuggling corrosive content into a myriad of performative landscapes that critically links the exploitation of the Earth to the exploitation of the woman body. I prescribe sacred satire as a healing balm for the societal body. Betty Grumble is the voice rattling the bars of conformity’s cage.

Black African lesbians are victims of corrective rape, particularly those in townships who are seen to challenge patriarchal gender norms.

The impact of discrimination is rendered more serious and their vulnerability increased by the fact that the victims are also seen as a threat to patriarchy and <b>hetero-normativity</b> which demarcate women's bodies as male property. The article focuses on how South Africa balances its constitutional mandate in relation to black African lesbians affected by corrective rape.

40|$|We {{understand}} that the news, the main product of journalism, is constructed from the multiple discourses that circulate within the present culture, influenced by the values related to the hegemonic norm that governs social behavior, the <b>hetero-normativity.</b> Through Discourse Analysis, we analyzed which representations of LGBT people the leading Brazilian newspapers Folha de S. Paulo and O Estado de S. Paulo help to build in our society. The search for recognition of sexual diversity operates via standardization, within a perspective that encourages a culture of tolerance, in which the representations of the group are anchored, strengthened by the moral and ideological discourse of religious institutions that deny LGBT people {{the possibility of the}} enjoyment of full citizenship. We conclude that as long as heterosexuality is not questioned by journalism and debated in the public sphere in an open and democratic way, it is difficult to combat prejudice and violence against LGBT people. </p...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} a critical account of heterosexual men’s online sex webcam performances {{in terms of}} the capacity for challenging or disrupting <b>hetero-normativity</b> and opening the field for the representation of a greater range of heterosexualities. Using a narrative analysis of selected examples of heterosexual performances on visual sex sites, it is argued that a deeply felt attachment to heterosexual identity coexists in complex, critical, and potentially disruptive ways with a contemporary, online approach to diverse, individualized sexual practices. Investigating examples of male performers who articulate an avowed heterosexual identity but perform acts for a gay male spectatorship and engage in practices such as self-penetration that are discursively marked by nonheterosexuality, this article explores the potential for the productive disruption of normative views of masculine heterosexuality without the need to resort to a free-floating argument for sexual fluidity. It is argued that, while heteronormativity is disrupted in such sites, masculinity has the capacity to reincorporate nonheterosexual behaviors and acts...|$|E

This question derives from debates around what (if any) contribution ‘straight’ researchers can make to queer theory/research.

This discussion grapples with a wider issue within identity politics around the participation of researchers who are regarded as representing the ‘norm’.

40|$|The {{process of}} ‘inhabitation’, {{the process of}} appropriating interior, {{domestic}} spaces by individuals is a complex phenomenon that has been studied in different disciplines and relying upon different theoretical frameworks. These frameworks often remain implicit, whereas they nevertheless have a profound impact {{as to how the}} economy of the interior is conceptualised. This article sets out to map three of these frameworks. We discuss phenomenology, critical theory and Actor-Network-Theory (ANT). Phenomenology holds that the home is a place deeply needed by all individuals {{in order to be able}} to really come into their own. Critical theory rather seeks to unravel the hidden meanings of the domestic interiors as tied up with the logics of capitalist economy, patriarchy and <b>hetero-normativity.</b> ANT studies objects and people as complex entanglements that can only be fully understood when taking their interrelations into account.

It focuses on {{the ways in which}} subjects negotiate institutionalized heterosexuality or <b>hetero-normativity</b> within everyday practices of intimacy. Subjects’ on-going negotiations that tell stories of multiple and contradictory subjectivities, are analysed to show how personal narratives of intimacy vary across a range of conflicting and competing colonialist, nationalist and trans-nationalist discourses of heterosexuality. Through analysing stories of homosocial intimacy, heterosexual coupling and expressions of intimacy; the research examines the power and vulnerability of ‘doing gender’, illustrates how ‘practices of intimacy’ overlap with ‘family practices’ and demonstrates that expressions of intimacy are socially ordered and linguistically mediated. The research critiques the ‘individualization thesis’ of reflexive modernization by showing how practices of intimacy are socio-culturally embedded within family relations, both real and imagined. By appreciating multiple meanings of power and agency, it also critiques a colonial-modernist notion of linear progress by illustrating the shifting meaning and the mutual co-constitution of the categories of ‘past’ and ‘present’, ‘tradition’ and ‘modern’, ‘East’ and ‘West’...|$|E
40|$|The LGBT {{community}} in Turkey faces {{a system of}} structural discrimination. It is not afforded {{the same rights as}} those of the hetero-normative majority of Turkish society, and most fundamentally, there exists a reciprocal relationship between the actors of the hetero sociopolitical sphere of state and non-state actors and the sphere of "homo-society". This relationship feeds into and is fed by the culture of patriarchy replicated in the homosexual sphere and the language of sexual binary opposition inherent in - but not unique to - the Turkish public domain to create a society in which structural discrimination and violence against sexual minorities is the norm. The existence of a strict patriarchy in the sphere of "homo-society", manifested through language of sexual binary opposition, provides the framework for structural discrimination against sexual minorities by the Turkish state and its tools of enforcement, as well as the nonstate actors of the public domain at large. This systematic discrimination against the LGBT community reinforces the patriarchy in LGBT spheres and categorizes its members as sexual deviants existing outside of the circle of <b>hetero-normativity,</b> and it has ultimately become entrenched into the Turkish cultural psyche...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1990 s Islam in Indonesia {{has shifted}} in {{orientation}} and gradually shed its depoliticized position. After {{the fall of}} the New Order in 1998 many female authors came to the fore and voiced their opinions about societal expectations, gender roles and norms that regulate female sexuality. Muslim women have addressed in their fiction issues regarding Islam, modernity and how to balance Islamic teachings with globalized forces that have changed Indonesian ways of living. This article analyzes three novels by Muslim author Abidah El Khalieqy in which the protagonists search for ways to shape new female identities and forms of selfhood that are in accordance with Islam and also suit the modernized world. The novels speak openly and in great detail about sexual relations. They critique polygyny and patriarchal attitudes that treat women as sexual objects and inferior beings, and disrupt taboos such as domestic violence and (marital) rape while endorsing women’s activism to advocate gender equity and social justice. They also demonstrate how women find pleasure in sexual intimacy. Abidah's fiction does not shy away from topics such as homosexuality and pre-marital sex but eventually <b>hetero-normativity</b> prevails. In significant ways Abidah's fiction contributes to debates on women's rights and gender expectations within Indonesia's Muslim community...|$|E
40|$|The burgeoning {{literature}} on intersectionality {{is a testament}} to its rapid uptake and wide appeal. Emerging from feminist strands of critical legal theory and sociology, intersectionality is increasingly recognized as a valuable theoretical framework for understanding how health and social inequities are shaped by complex intersecting social locations, categories of difference and systems of oppression. Researchers who engage in intersectionality‐based research are particularly concerned with the ways in which people's lived realities and experiences of oppression result from dynamic interactions between dominant forces such as age‐based discrimination, classism, <b>hetero‐normativity,</b> racialization and colonialism among other forms of social differentiation and exclusion. From the framework of intersectionality, experiences of oppression are temporal, spatial and contingent on cultural and historical contexts. In this paper, we explore the theoretical and philosophical assumptions underlying intersectionality and discuss its methodological implications for researchers. We focus on issues of commensurability between intersectionality and the theoretical underpinnings of particular research methodologies (case study, critical ethnography and critical discourse analysis)   and suggest that using diverse qualitative methodologies and methods through an intersectionality framework will contribute to the ongoing development of tools for qualitative inquiry. In taking up different methodologies and research methods, we provide examples of how approaches to inquiry may be better “fitted” to an intersectionality framework and discuss how remaining tensions can be harnessed to productively contribute to qualitative health research...|$|E
40|$|May 21, 1998 {{marked the}} end of an era in Indonesian history. On that day President Suharto {{announced}} his resignation as the circumstances forced him to step down after thirty-two years. In Jakarta the days preceding Suharto’s resignation were ‘full of high drama, nerve-racking suspense, and unexpected turns ’ and four students from Trisakti University were shot ‘without any provocation ’ (Suryakusuma 2004 : 3). Indonesia entered a period of Reformasi (reform) which gave way to more democratic institutions and more freedom of speech for writers, filmmakers, journalists, and the public at large. As Reformasi relaxed the long-standing constraints on media and public life at large, many women emerged publicly and engaged in cultural production. All of a sudden it was possible to challenge Suharto’s authoritarianism and masculinist paradigm of power that had defined the roles of women almost exclusively within the domestic sphere (state ibuism). 2 A new generation defied the New Order’s monolithic culture and way of thinking. More liberated ideas regarding sexuality, particularly female sexuality as well as homosexuality have come to the fore since 1998, undermining the <b>hetero-normativity</b> and societal expectations of marriage and family that were strongly endorsed during the Suharto years. The much-debated novel Saman by Ayu Utami (born 1968), published one month before Suharto’s fall from power (April 1998), presents in an outspoken (some would say blunt) way female characters who enjoy their bodies and sexuality, and are openly promiscuous. Some critics and readers have found the book’s content immoral, and its language ‘vulgar’. Five and a half years later (December 2003) the American...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{theme in}} studies of enclosure and resource access in Southeast Asian hinges {{on the concept of}} the ‘political forest’, a particular constellation of power constituted by ideas, practices and institutions that seek to regulate peoples’ access to resources, providing recognition and legitimacy to some, whilst excluding and criminalizing others. Whilst issues of class and ‘race’ underpin work in this vein, in Indonesia, much less attention has been directed towards the ways in which gender inheres in the regularisation of land and livelihood, and the ordering of upland spaces. Drawing on recent feminist and queer theorizing of the links between citizenship, recognition and <b>hetero-normativity,</b> and on analyses of the social relationships through which resource access is negotiated and realized, the paper presents a feminist political ecology of the gender dynamics inherent in the power plays of resource access as land-poor rural migrants negotiate a shifting landscape of enclosure in Lampung province. Through an analysis of three periods of resource governance and control in the province, the paper shows how the negotiation of resource access is simultaneously a process of self-regulation and subject-making that draws on particular ideas about family and conjugal partnership, inculcating gendered and hetero-normative ideologies of the “ideal citizen”. Through particular representational strategies – positionings – necessary to qualify for resource access, and through the material practices necessary to realize the benefits of resource access, conjugal partnership is reiterated and remade as an important social relationship through which resource access may be realised, for men as well as for women...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} concerns how activists preserve particular feminisms {{in everyday}} life, particularly in this postmodern moment as {{advances in technology}} create virtual spaces, as feminism experiences generational shifts, and as notions about gender and bodies influence the discursive and political construction of contemporary activism and communities. The particular feminists {{at the center of}} this study are self-described radical feminists. While original theories allowed members to question the essentialism of bodies (i. e., sex class), this study focuses on the movement trajectory in which members critique how people assigned male at birth learn masculinity as inextricably tied to the oppression of women (i. e., sex caste). Using data from a historical newsletter and two current micro-blogs, I provide a textual analysis to understand how public narratives of gender and essentialism circulate in and are challenged by feminist (cyber) spaces. The results of this project suggest four important findings. First, in print and online, people use imagined and essential understandings of bodies where actual bodies are not present in order to exclude. Second, when text reflects the personal, lived experiences of community members, logic and emotion are better connected in the everyday. On the other hand, when lived actuality is abstracted, storytellers rely almost exclusively on logic to make claims. Third, while lesbian newsletter-writers of the past constructed a sexual identity, they did not take on the radical-feminist mandate to talk about sexual desire. Online, only the radical identity of the movement’s predecessor’s has persisted, while any discussions of sexual identity or pleasure are missing. Lastly, while radical and trans-identified feminists often find themselves at odds, this study suggests that perhaps their consciousness-raising practices are more similar than can be seen from the everyday. Both groups use poetry and creative writing as a way to make sense of their coming-out and being-out experiences amid cis- and <b>hetero-normativity...</b>|$|E
40|$|While Italy has a {{tradition}} of inclusive policies and practices, the efforts have been exclusively oriented to protect certain categories considered weaker and disadvantaged, namely: physical or mental disabled, psychiatric patients, drug addicts, young workers from troubled families and former detainees (Murgia & Poggio, 2010). Other forms of diversity, such as sexual orientation, are not included in the aims of the social enterprises that are specifically founded to provide social services through the social and work integration of disadvantaged groups. However, unequal treatment can still be perpetrated within those organizations that have the social objective of promoting the rights of minority groups (Smith, 2005). The discrimination against LGBT persons is difficult to individuate because <b>hetero-normativity</b> is naturalized through performances and dominant discourses that silence minority sexual identities (Butler, 1997). The present work examines how organizations, whose mission is the social integration of minority groups, manage the inclusion of LGBT workers and what are the experiences of LGBT workers within such organizations. Data were collected through in-depth interviews and focus groups with managers and LGBT employees from four social enterprises. Findings show that, in spite of the organizations’ ethos of inclusion, discriminatory practices such as silence, gossip and derogatory comments are common and depicted as normal, thus revealing a deeply rooted heterosexist culture based on moral and religious values. The lack of policies around LGBT issues is supported by the widespread idea that sexual orientation is a private matter and by the taken for granted heterosexuality. Alternative discourses about sexual orientation are limited by the splitting between private and public life that contributes to make sexual minorities invisible (Foucault, 1976). Such dynamics contribute to the absence of power of minority individuals and influence their decision to remain silent (Ward & Winstanley, 2003) ...|$|E
40|$|Written at a {{time when}} the number of {{students}} taking standardized tests in U. S. public schools is at an all-time high, this dissertation presents and analyzes the contribution of standardized testing to intellectual identity formation as portrayed within the oral histories of four adults from the post- 2 ̆ 2 A Nation at Risk 2 ̆ 2 (1983) and pre- 2 ̆ 2 No Child Left Behind 2 ̆ 2 (2001) eras. The study uses methods from discourse analysis and oral history research to find stories that serve as artifacts of the history of standardized testing and related educational and testing policies. Each oral history is unique and has a connection to the University of Iowa and its role in the history of testing. The five participants share stories exploring their experiences with the SAT, ACT, Iowa Test of Basic Skills, intelligence tests, and tests for Attention Deficit Disorder and placement exams. Each story explores what can happen to a person 2 ̆ 7 s intellectual identity when standardized testing forms relationships with that individual 2 ̆ 7 s history with trauma, race, class, gender, <b>hetero-normativity</b> and self-esteem. By design, this study is less focused on providing broad extrapolations than in placing individual oral histories in conversation with one another and contextualizing them within the history of intelligence testing and achievement testing. It does so with the goal of conveying the long-term effects of standardized testing on each of the four storytellers, and suggests researchers have not given enough attention to examining ways standardized tests interact with how individuals shape their intellectual identity. In doing so, it complicates the arguments of standardized testing advocates who claim the tests can achieve cultural neutrality even though they have sprung from norms and methods and measures deemed valuable by a culture. This study invites future research on similar questions, including how a belief in the objectivity of standardized testing imbues it with credibility and shapes the expectations we have of others and ourselves...|$|E
40|$|A queer {{ecosystem}} is {{a community}} of living organisms (witches, gaybies, sissies and fantastic creatures) {{in conjunction with the}} non-living components of their environment (things like house music, MDMA and haute-couture), interacting as a system. I use the paradigm of an ecosystem to articulate the complex inter-relationships between the organic and inorganic components of my community as a way of reconciling my practice with nature. Within this queer ecosystem I work as a mythopoeic artist who focuses on the creation of myths relevant to their personal history and community. There is a broad cultural and historical base spanning millennia: from composite fabulae exemplified by the sphinx to the preternatural vampire vividly alive in contemporary pop culture. Drawing from this investigation I have created my own Fantastic Creatures. These beings conflate human, animal and fantasy forms to establish links between nature, culture and spirit. I communicate these stories through a body-based practice. I modify my body through a series of prosthesis: masks and full-body costumes in a process of craft narrative. I propagate my mythopoeia through live performance and video based expression. I schematize these fantastic creatures in a Phasmahammer based on an individualized understanding of the graphic and narrative potential of the bestiary. Medieval bestiaries developed from classical sources were illustrated collections of ordinary, hybrid and mythological creatures featuring allegorical commentary on the moral significance of each figure. Phasmahammer intertwines fact and fable, the familiar and the fantastical. Where once this allegorical process addressed explicitly Christian morals, I refocus this historical approach to project a queered ideology resistive of patriarchal monotheisms, capitalism, <b>hetero-normativity,</b> colonial authority and binary thinking. This bestiary traces the branches of each figure’s evolutionary tree, connecting them to their queer ancestors and delineating blood, clan and family lines. The bestiary looks at the thresholds where these figures exist – their sites of ritual, points of dissemination and modes of storytelling. The intent of the bestiary is to reposition the centralization of the human figure and to place it is as just one of many beings in an ecology, which reimagines and contests established taxonomic hierarchies...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} heteronormativity and {{gay and lesbian}} representations in advertising. <b>Hetero-normativity</b> stands for a notion, which regards heterosexuality as a norm; the right way of sexuality. Heteronormativity also reinforces the perception of binary gender and traditional gender roles. Individuals who do not identify themselves with such norms feel exclusion and other social and psychological difficulties, when heteronormativity is present in different institutions of societies. One example of such institutions is advertising. The marketers, i. e. the companies producing the marketing messages to consumers, take part in constructing our society. They create meaning in their marketing and branding, and with their power and visibility in the marketplace, companies can influence social phenomena, such as the social standing of sexual minorities. This study aims at recognizing the elements, which maintain the heteronormativity in advertising. Additionally, LGBT representations are examined. McCracken's (1986) Cultural meaning transfer model explains how cultural meaning moves from the culturally constituted world to consumer goods through advertising and further to consumers through different consumption rituals. I used the Cultural meaning transfer model as a theoretical framework in my visual social semiotic analysis of the selected advertisements, focusing especially on the advertising's part in the meaning transfer process. Heteronormativity is widely discussed in gender and media studies, especially in queer theory. These research streams provided crucial theoretical background knowledge. Six commercials were selected for analysis. Commercials had been shown in Finnish companies' online channels, thus they were targeted to Finnish consumers. A visual social semiotic analysis explains representational, interactive and compositional meaning of each commercial, giving {{a detailed description of}} components constructing the symbolic meaning in the selected advertisements. The findings show that heteronormativity is present in many of the advertisements, mainly in the dialogues and the appearance of the characters, which both build the narratives of life, where hetero-sexuality is idealized. However, there are also gay and lesbian representations in the commercials. As demanded as the LGBT representations are, the analysis illustrates that the execution of the portrayal of sexual minorities often falls short, as they tend to be stereotypical and one-sided...|$|E
40|$|The white wedding {{narrative}} of popular discourses concerns the ideal wedding and bridal moment. The bride is protagonist and 'star' of this fairytale, which {{begins with a}} marriage proposal, accompanied by a dashing groom and dazzling diamonds, and ends with 'happily ever after' for the bridal couple. Replete with the celebratory aspects of a rite of passage, the white wedding fairytale is characterised by bridal traditions, and an exhaustive list of etiquette requirements. Representations of 'real life' wedding fairytales (for example, the wedding of Mary Donaldson to Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark) are circulated by Australian women's and gossip magazines. A context is thereby provided for the narratives constructed by the more specialised genre of bridal magazines and planners. The bride is invited by such texts to plan and perform a range of manufactured bridal traditions in {{the execution of the}} ideal wedding of popular discourses. Critical considerations of the white wedding have posited this ritual as a site for the reproduction of cultural norms and ideals, such as prescribed femininity, heterosexuality and 'whiteness'. The literature has typically focused on either cultural production (the wedding industry) or on cultural consumption (more general experiences of the wedding). Despite this polarity, studies tend to understand cultural power as dominative, romance ideology as manipulative, brides (consumers) as living in a state of false consciousness as passive consumers, and most importantly, cultural meaning as 'fixed' through the production process. This thesis draws from Stuart Halls seminal paper on televisual texts, reworking his encoding and decoding method towards a reading of womens and bridal publications. Bridal traditions are often reproduced, with little or no variation, and mass disseminated across a range of women's texts, encoding a preferred meaning/reading of these cultural practices. However, cultural meanings are not understood to be 'fixed' through the production process or passively consumed by the 'unsuspecting' masses. Departing from existing critical literature, cultural meanings are recast as contradictory, fluid, and open to interpretation. This thesis argues that in positing the white wedding fairytale as the preferred reading of cultural texts, one can query the idea that weddings reproduce <b>hetero-normativity...</b>|$|E
40|$|Another major {{endeavor}} of {{this thesis}} concentrates on self-formulations of these queer sf bodies and textualities. My elaboration concerns their delineation of ontological pursuit, multi-hybrid post/non-humanity, {{and a highly}} self-aware appropriation of obscene, ambivalent and amoral performatives to constitute deviant cultural strategies which have by far successfully counter-written dominant politics' desire to assimilate dissident voices and recalcitrant sites. My thesis provides three different approaches to re-read non-realistic, fantasmatic queer gender formations and trans-masculine sexualities. From these positions and perspectives, I will argue for the emergent force of queer transboyhood and gradual recognition given to several non-normative transgender masculine presences, starting from their connections and disagreements with old-guard lesbian feminist agenda and homo-normative les-bi-gay politics. This multitude built by trans-masculine affects not only greatly disturbs <b>hetero-normativity</b> and homo-normative discourses, such charismatic inscriptions which link into marginal territories also have created a persistent intervention to interfere and even convert/pervert canonized texts and representational modes. In these chapters to extrapolate this queer masculine sf heterogenesis, I focus on analyzing three archetypes of trans-masculine personalities and their highly different subjectivities. My aim for these analyses is to theorize how these marginal genders and bodies counterattack, infect, and thus re-write mega-historical narratives by their cultural momentum and anti-human poetics/politics. By performing these "infections", queer masculine subjectivity twists and transforms a seemingly liberal hegemony devoted to excluding the non-normative {{in the name of}} single-minded progress and bi-polar gender dichotomy. This dissertation proposes to closely study writings on queer masculinity in English science fiction and fantasy, forming a trajectory of queer transboy representations from 1930 s to the beginning of 21 st century. By this project, I embark to articulate multi-layered historical contexts between speculative literature, sub-cultural sites, transgender politics, and constructions on marginal queer-gendered bodies. Through intertextual dynamics embedded within and among theoretical frameworks such as sf study, paraliterary interaction, penumbra sub-subjective tactics, post-human/trans-species writings, I will conduct articulations to generate forms and genealogies of queer masculinity in sf realm, building their continuum and ruptures, agency and subversive power. 洪泠泠.

Estabeleci como pergunta de pesquisa: quais os significados do corpo, sentimentos e valores disseminados através das narrativas escritas para crianças nas suas imagens (ilustrações) ? O objeto de estudo dessa investigação é a materialidade a subjetividade corpo presentes de tais narrativas. Essa pesquisa qualiquantitativa, porém de predominância qualitativa, adota a metodologia documental como procedimento científico, a fim de analisar o conteúdo dos dados colhidos acervo Programa Nacional Biblioteca da Escola (PNBE) : leitura e biblioteca nas escolas públicas brasileiras/ 2012. Defini como objetivo geral: analisar as dimensões corporais identitárias apresentadas nas narrativas escritas para crianças com base nas teorias sociológicas, filosóficas e antropológicas e, como objetivos específicos: (1) revelar os achados através de categorias de análise, tais como: raça, etnia, sexo e gênero; e (2) identificar os bens culturais e simbólicos transmitidos através do conteúdo das narrativas. Essa tese assume como pressuposto que o acervo do PNBE faz emergir as pluralidades, sentimentos e valores indentitários das corporificações infantis nas narrativas, e revela conteúdos com significados e sentidos em consonância com o multiculturalismo e a diversidade da sociedade brasileira. Os achados demonstram que há uma significativa abertura para as etnias e raças no sentido global com a inclusão das narrativas estrangeiras. Estas também apresentam fluidez nos corpos que fogem dos padrões adotados como bom comportamento, mas mantêm heteronormatividade. Contudo as narrativas brasileiras não comtemplam a diversidade e o multiculturalismo nacional. Poucos autores/as brasileiros/as trazem à tona personagens principais de diferentes etnias, assim como grupos sociais que estão em condições de vulnerabilidade social. The {{focus of}} this thesis is the analysis of images and narratives which present children s bodies. Special attention {{is given to the}} body markers that are in words in a strict connection between sema (language) and soma (body) These narratives as I discuss in the thesis, bring within them seeds that may (or may not) mark, model, alienate or liberate the children s bodies so that they may exercise in full their physical, mental and intellectual capacities as defined in the National Educational Low 1996. Literary production per se is included in the field of Cultural Studies as it is a production of human art. The state of art constructed as theoretical inputs for this research is of a multidisciplinary character, and covers the fields of knowledge in the areas of Sociology, Anthropology, Philosophy, Literary Theory, Infant-juvenile Literature and Infant Education. One must point out the fact that here I show evidence that the productions in the fields of Sociology and Anthropology do not yet consider studies about narratives written for children {{from the perspective of the}} child s body, hence originality and theoretic-scientific relevance of this research. I place as the research: what are the meanings of body, feelings and values disseminated through narratives for children and their illustration? The objects of study in this investigation are the materiality and subjectivity of the body present in the narratives written for children and the images of such narratives. This qualitative-quantitative research adopts the documental methodology as scientific procedure with the aim of analysing the content of the data collected constituted of the collection of The National Library for Schools Programme : Reading and Library in Brazilian State Schools/ 2012. I defined as my general aim: to analyse the dimensions of Bodies as identities presented in the narratives written for children based on sociological, philosophical and anthropological theories and, as specific objectives: (1) to reveal the findings through categories of analysis such as: race, ethnicity, sex and gender; and (2) identify the cultural and symbolic assets transmitted through the narrative content. This thesis presupposes that the collection of narratives brings out the pluralities, feelings and identifying values of the children s embodiments in the narratives, and reveals contents with meanings and senses in accordance with the multiculturalism and the diversity of standards in Brazilian society. The findings demonstrate that there is a significant opening for the ethnic groups and races in a global sense with the inclusion of foreign narratives. These also present a fluidity and lightness in the bodies, but within <b>hetero-normativity.</b> However, the Brazilian narratives do not take into account the country s diversity and multiculturalism. A very few Brazilian authors present main characters from ethnic groups and different ethnicities that belong to groups in a socially vulnerable state...|$|E
40|$|My paper {{focuses on}} the {{different}} kinds of audiences represented in Electronic Arts’ hugely successful game The Sims, isolating the female player from the male player, the queer player from the straight player, and the racially or ethnically marginalized player from the Caucasian player. It will focus on how The Sims, praised as socially progressive for its liberal views towards same-sex relationships, absence of racial stereotyping, and non-sexualized presentation of women, is interpreted by, targeted toward, and marketed to these various different audiences. The paper will conclude that this recent spike in social liberalism may not be the result of a socio-cultural change in ideology, but a change in economic strategy and the marketing of cultural and sexual difference. The history of the video game medium is glaringly phallocentric and greatly mono-cultural. The traditional target market for all types of digital gaming is male – and predominately young, white, middle-class, and principally heterosexual males. While early games featured abstracted avatars and characters that might have appealed to everyone regardless of gender, sexuality, and race – nothing in the game play of Atari/arcade era games like Asteroids (1979), Missile Command (1980) or Space Invaders (1978) suggested the personal details of the unseen characters involved, and it was hard for players to identify with nonrepresentational figures like Q-Bert and Pac-man on the basis of ethnicity or sexuality – more photo-realistic games emerging in the mid-eighties depicted playable heroes in such a way to appeal to target audiences. The vast majority of playable characters from this era were male, customarily white when depicted as humanoid, and presumably heterosexual, since female love interests were frequently being rescued by the male heroes (examples from contemporary and classic digital games are provided in the paper). Theories concerning this lack of diversity are, of course, rooted in Western culture’s histories of patriarchy, <b>hetero-normativity,</b> and Caucasian-centred thinking, but are also influenced by other sociological factors affecting how gender, sexuality and race are intertwined with technology and new-media. According to Brunner, Bennett, and Honey, women and people of colour avoid taking advanced level courses in mathematics, science and technology more often than Caucasian males, leaving the industries responsible for designing digital games dominated by white men (72). This warrants regarding video games and technological advances on a whole as material commodities "developed, controlled and directed by a ‘patriarchal’ capitalism, and as unequally distributed and hence differently accessible [to women and minorities]" (Bryson & de Castell 256). Thus a circular pattern appears: games designed by white males come to reflect the interests, experiences, and biases of their designers, and are consumed primarily by white male audiences. The "others" not included in this pattern – women, same-sex desiring people, and people of marginalized races and ethnicities – often get misrepresented, stereotyped, or ignored in the medium. However, in recent years, several digital games have emerged that fulfill the representation and identification interests of traditionally "othered" audiences – The Sims being one such game. I argue that the reasoning behind such inclusions does not necessarily reflect a sudden change in cultural liberalism, but instead reflects a change in how traditionally marginalized people are marketed to in late capitalism. Gaming companies have been targeting non-traditional gamers since the mid-to-late nineties, when, according to Henry Jenkins, increased competition began to limit the profits any one company could earn from the core market of young white males: [The] game market had entered into an age of heightened competition at a time when, in fact, ninety percent of American boys were already playing computer games. To survive, these game companies understood that they would need to expand their market and thus, then as now, there were… [new] targets… (Jenkins, "Further Reflections") Given my hypothesis of a correlation between late-capitalist marketing and the representation of difference, I will begin my analysis by discussing how the setting of The Sims, the North American suburbs, is intimately linked to how difference is perceived in the game: the suburbs carry with them a set of constructed expectations and values that cannot be ignored when thinking about difference in the game. Suburbia was created for the middle and upper classes to escape from overcrowded urban centres, and from the increasingly impoverished, increasingly different people inhabiting them (Flanagan; Spigel 3, 16). I want to suggest that The Sims holds a contradictory relationship with its deeply coded setting, a relationship that is both progressive and regressive. While it does not necessarily conform to the cultural, familial, and gender role definitions associated with the postwar suburbs – people of colour are welcome, families don’t have to be nuclear, and women don’t have to be domestic caretakers – The Sims does conform to the suburban philosophy of sameness. The social, sexual, and ethnic differences included in the game do not define the characters involved. Despite the array of different kinds of people featured, everyone is standardized into one category of "normal. " While standardization on the basis of social equality is not what I’m arguing against, I am instead weary about the mould for this standard, which is detectably aligned with the traditional patriarchal, heterosexual, and Caucasian-centred suburban space. This theory forms the base of my subsequent arguments. Since the debut of The Sims in early 2000, the bulk of the criticism surrounding it has stated that its players are "more often than not" female (Brooks 58). That women and girls are thought to make up the majority of players for this mainstream video game is significant given widespread assumptions that the medium is unappealing to females, and that the dominant demographic of players is made up of boys and young men. Indeed, it is regular to theorize video games as a part of "boy culture" (Jenkins, "Complete Freedom" 269 - 270). However, The Sims, more so than any other PC product right now, allows for the complication of gender norms. This is perhaps surprising since it manages to do so while still ascribing to historically gendered settings (the home, the commercial district) and activities (home decoration, caretaking) and {{in such a way that}} keeps any deviations from social normativity the option of the player, not a preprogrammed aspect of the game that must be addressed by all players. Similarly, the homosexual acts performed in The Sims do not define the identities of the preprogrammed characters - sexuality is an action, not an identity, at least not in the game elements offered by Electronic Arts. By not creating gay identities to choose from, EA avoids being accused of generalizing or essentializing perceived and perhaps stereotyped traits of people who identify as gay or lesbian (Consalvo 186). They avoid the sticky problems confronted by toy companies like Mattel, the makers of Barbie, when creating dolls or figurines meant to represent difference. Cultural critic Ann duCille explains how Mattel, facing criticism for not making their black Barbie dolls distinct from their classic blonde, white Barbies began producing dolls that reinforced and emphasized racially stereotyped physical features (558). The producers of The Sims seem to have side-stepped the issue. By putting the tools of identity creation into the hands of players, EA can still appeal to homosexual consumers, while not having to determine themselves what "gay" or "lesbian" looks like. But would this tactic work the same in a game with fixed characters and narrative? Is difference only depicted where it is profitable? Does the fact that The Sims is directly marketed to non-traditional audiences factor into its content? Of course, just the possibility of queer relationships in a high profile mainstream video game is a progressive step forward for our traditionally heterosexist culture – but one arguably taken only to welcome traditionally "othered" consumers into the culture of late capitalism. The same is true for ethnic and racial difference in the game. Beyond the shade of skin tone, there is no difference between any two Sims created; ethnic and cultural differences are not programmed aspects of the game. While this ensures that every Sim is given equal footing socially and there is no discrimination on the basis of skin colour (a positive thing, however unrealistic), there are no differentiations among people of different racial make up – meaning everyone conforms to the same cultural lifestyle – that of the middle class, Caucasian suburbanite. In this regard, The Sims assimilates ethnic difference into white American society. Being more melting pot than multicultural paradise, the preprogrammed world of The Sims denies ethnic players the particularities of their culture in the game: while it is possible to create and import a Musalla prayer rug into the game, players do not have the power to program or animate their conceived Muslim characters to use it. This elimination or impossibility of cultural difference has made the history of the characters playable in The Sims very much the history of the white American suburbanite. I conlcude by asking why there has been this sudden spike in social liberalism, at least on the surface, in such games as The Sims. I suggest that it could be, as Naomi Klein states, a kind of exploitation of diversity initiated by targeting untraditional markets to better tap into the consuming potential of millions of non-white, non-male, non-heterosexual people – what Stuart Hall sees as the commercial appropriation of difference (Hall 273). Klein argues that in the early nineties, corporate producers and marketers of pop culture embraced Generation X’s demand for more liberal diversity and positive representation of marginalized peoples, but did so not out of conversion of political belief, but because of the financial rewards involved (Klein 110 - 111). I believe this applies to the "identity and gaming" issue proposed for the conference...|$|E
