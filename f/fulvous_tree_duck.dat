5|$|The fulvous {{whistling}} duck or <b>fulvous</b> <b>tree</b> <b>duck</b> (Dendrocygna bicolor) is a whistling duck that breeds {{across the}} world's tropical regions in much of Mexico and South America, the West Indies, the southern US, sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It has mainly reddish brown plumage, long legs and a long grey bill, and shows a distinctive white band across its black tail in flight. Like other members of its ancient lineage, it has a whistling call which is given in flight or on the ground. The preferred habitat is shallow lakes, paddy fields or other wetlands with plentiful vegetation.|$|E

Most of the species are tropical in distribution, and {{in all of them}} the pair bond seems to be permanent and potentially lifelong. Both sexes share equally in brood-rearing responsibilities, and in some species the male is known to participate in incubation as well.

500|$|The duck {{was first}} {{described}} by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789 {{and given the}} name Anas fulva but the name was [...] "preoccupied," [...] or already used, by Friedrich Christian Meuschen in 1787 for another species. This led to the next available name proposed by French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816 from a Paraguayan specimen as Anas bicolor The whistling ducks were moved to their current genus, Dendrocygna, by British ornithologist William John Swainson in recognition of their differences from other ducks. The genus name {{is derived from the}} Ancient Greek dendron, [...] "tree", and Latin cygnus, [...] "swan", and [...] bicolor is Latin for [...] "two-coloured". [...] "Fulvous" [...] means reddish-yellow, and is derived from the Latin equivalent fulvus. Old and regional names include large whistling teal, brown <b>tree</b> <b>duck,</b> Mexican duck, squealer and Spanish cavalier.|$|R

40|$|Remarkable {{changes in}} waterbird numbers were {{recorded}} in South Bohemia during the 1980 s. The decline in numbers of most duck species and many other aquatic bird species (such as Podicipedidae, Rallidae,, Larus ridi-bundus) was obviously the most important change recorded on South Bohemian fishponds during the irst half of the 1980 s. On the contrary, increases in numbers were recorded only in several species (Phalacrocorax carbo, Cygnus olor). Increasing mortality (due to botulism) was recorded in many waterfowl species, and an increase of the non-breeding component {{of the population was}} found in ducks, but no changes {{were recorded in}} reproductive parameters (brood size, clutch size, breeding success). A shift to field habitats was recorded in breeding waders. Possible causes affecting the abundance of particular waterbird species are discussed: these include changes in management of surrounding landscape, drainage of wetlands in the vicinity of fishponds (ducks, waders), changes in littoral stands (ducks, waders, passerines), water level fluctuation (Anser anser, waders, passerines), gradual coverage of islets by shrubs and <b>trees</b> (<b>ducks),</b> increase of fish stock (ducks).

40|$|Whistling ducks {{comprise}} {{a group of}} nine species that are primarily of tropical and subtropical distribution. In common with the swans and true geese (which with them comprise the subfamily Anserinae), the included species have a reticulated tarsal surface pattern, lack sexual dimorphism in plumage, produce vocalizations that are similar or identical in both sexes, form relatively permanent pair bonds, and lack complex pair-forming behavior patterns. Unlike the geese and swans, whistling ducks have clear, often melodious whistling voices that are the basis for their group name. The alternative name, <b>tree</b> <b>ducks,</b> is far less appropriate, since few of the species regularly perch or nest in trees. All the species have relatively long legs and large feet that extend beyond the fairly short tail when the birds are in flight. They dive well, and some species obtain much of their food in this manner. Eight species are represented in the genus Dendrocygna, including {{all three of the}} species included in this book. A ninth species, the African and Madagascan white-backed duck (Thalassornis leuconotus), is considered by the author (Johnsgard, 1966) to be an aberrant whistling duck.
