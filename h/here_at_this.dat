25|$|Moa and moa hunters {{went into}} decline {{but a new}} Classic Māori culture evolved, characterised by the {{construction}} of pa, fortified villages, and new peoples arrived on the Otago Peninsula. People <b>here</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time practised {{what has been called}} a foraging economy. Increasing reliance seems to have been placed on harvesting the root of the cabbage tree (cordylline australis) and 'umu ti', cabbage tree ovens, proliferate over some parts of the Peninsula showing intensive use of the land.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} processes attracted many craftsman, {{merchants and}} artists with such talented ones among them as Kracker János Lukács, Anton Maulberts, Franz Sigrist, Josef Gerl, Jakab Fellner and Henrik Fasola. The town population grew suddenly. While in 1688 {{it was only}} 1200, in 1787 more than 17,000 people lived <b>here.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> time, Eger was the 6th largest town of Hungary (based {{on the number of}} its inhabitants). Viticulture also reached its brightest period in these days. The wine-growing area was twelve times larger than it had been earlier.|$|E
25|$|An {{academy of}} art formed in 1870 {{and the present}} Art Gallery of New South Wales {{building}} began construction in 1896. Inspired by the works of French impressionism, artists camps formed around the foreshores of Sydney Harbour in the 1880s and 1890s at idyllique locations such as Balmoral Beach and Curlew Camp in Sirius Cove. Artists such as Arthur Streeton and Tom Roberts of the Heidelberg School worked <b>here</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time and created some of the masterpieces of newly developing and distinctively Australian styles of painting.|$|E

Schram {{believed that it was}} <b>here,</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> school, that [...] "we can date the real beginnings of Mao's intellectual and political development". Mao remained at the school for seven or eight months, before deciding to enroll at a middle school in the provincial capital of Changsha.|$|E
500|$|Formal {{excavations}} {{are first}} recorded at Earl's Knoll on Papa Stronsay in the Statistical Account of Scotland in 1795. As with the Dwarfie Stane, the mound {{was assumed to}} be a giant's grave at the time. Following soon after this, work on the [...] "Picts-house" [...] (i.e. chambered tomb) at Quanterness commenced, but little else of note was achieved until the mid 19th century. F. W. L. Thomas, whose day job was as a Captain in the Royal Navy published The Celtic Antiquities of Orkney in 1852, which listed various sites and aimed to interest [...] "antiquarians" [...] in the subject. His hopes were met and about a dozen chambered tombs were worked on between 1849 and 1867 by James Farrer, R.J. Hebden and George Petrie. However, other than work at Unstan near Stromness there was then a lull for about six decades. Then, from the late 1920s, work recommenced {{with the assistance of the}} Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland and the Ministry of Works. The most eminent archaeologist to work <b>here</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time was Vere Gordon Childe. He was involved in excavations at Skara Brae and Rinyo, but it was only when a shard of pottery was discovered at the latter site that it became understood that these settlements dated to the Neolithic rather than the Iron Age. A further 18 tombs were excavated before 1950, including five on Eday and one on the Calf of Eday and by the 1960s the outlines of a modern understanding of Orcadian prehistory had emerged. The advent of radiocarbon dating enabled even more detailed dates to be established and refuted earlier theories that the chambered tombs of Orkney had developed from similar structures found in the Eastern Mediterranean, such as those built by the Minoans, when it became clear that the former pre-dated the latter by a considerable margin.|$|E

2500|$|E. Urner Goodman {{also wrote}} the Owasippe Hymn {{that would become}} the Reservation's song that is sung {{at the end of}} all opening and closing campfires by the staff. The {{original}} lyrics written in 1927 by Dr. Goodman remain in the museum. According to a now older staff alumni, Joseph Sener, he stood with Sheridan Nunn at the shore of the current location of the Blackhawk Fire-bowl during Camp Blackhawk's relocation and Nunn said, [...] "it was <b>here</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> spot in 1927 that I sat with E. Urner Goodman as he wrote out the lyrics to the Owasippe Hymn". Sener recounts how when he heard that he was smart enough to know how amazing and important that was.|$|E
2500|$|Many leading deities of the Aztec pantheon were worshipped by {{previous}} Mesoamerican civilizations, gods such as Tlaloc, Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca, who were venerated by different names in most cultures {{throughout the history}} of Mesoamerica. For the Aztecs especially important deities were the rain god Tlaloc, the god Huitzilopochtli—patron of the Mexica tribe—as well as Quetzalcoatl the feathered serpent, wind god, culture hero, and god of civilization and order, and elusive Tezcatlipoca, the shrewd god of destiny and fortune, connected with war and sorcery. ↵Each of these gods had their own shrine, side-by-side {{at the top of the}} largest pyramid in the Aztec capital Mexico-Tenochtitlan—Tlaloc and Huitzilopochtli were both worshipped <b>here</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> dual temple, while a third monument in the plaza before the Templo Mayor was devoted to the wind god Ehecatl.|$|E
2500|$|The {{backlash}} included vocal critics, including disgruntled {{patients and}} consumer-advocacy groups, {{who argued that}} managed care plans were controlling costs by denying medically necessary services to patients, even in life-threatening situations, or by providing low-quality care. The volume of criticism led many states to pass laws mandating managed-care standards. Meanwhile, insurers responded to public demands and political pressure by beginning to offer other plan options with more comprehensive care networks—according to one analysis, between the years 1970 and 2005 the share of personal health expenditures paid directly out-of-pocket by U.S. consumers fell from about 40 percent to 15 percent. So although consumers faced rising health insurance premiums over the period, lower out-of-pocket costs likely [...] encouraged consumers to use more health care. Data indicating whether this increase in use was due to voluntary or optional service purchases or the sudden access lower-income citizens had to basic healthcare is not available <b>here</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time.|$|E
