5|$|After {{events in}} Munich, Jennings {{continued}} {{to report on}} Middle East issues. In 1973, he covered the Yom Kippur War, and the following year, he served as chief correspondent and co-producer of Sadat: Action Biography, a profile of <b>Egyptian</b> <b>president</b> Anwar Sadat that would win him his first of two George Foster Peabody Awards. The documentary established Jennings as Sadat's favorite correspondent. That summer, Jennings married {{for the second time}} to Anouchka Malouf, a Lebanese photographer. His first wife was childhood sweetheart Valerie Godsoe.|$|E
5|$|In September 1960, Castro flew to New York City for the General Assembly of the United Nations. Staying at the Hotel Theresa in Harlem, he {{met with}} journalists and anti-establishment figures like Malcolm X. He also met Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, with the two {{publicly}} condemning the poverty and racism faced by Americans in areas like Harlem. Relations between Castro and Khrushchev were warm; they led the applause to one another's speeches at the General Assembly. Subsequently, visited by Polish First Secretary Władysław Gomułka, Bulgarian Chairman Todor Zhivkov, <b>Egyptian</b> <b>President</b> Gamal Abdel Nasser and Indian Premier Jawaharlal Nehru, Castro also received an evening's reception from the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.|$|E

5000|$|Tahseen Bashir, or Tahsin Basheer, (April 1925 - June 11, 2002) was an Egyptian {{diplomat who}} served as both a confidant and {{spokesman}} for several <b>Egyptian</b> <b>presidents,</b> including Gamal Nasser and Anwar Sadat. In 1977, Bashir was appointed Egypt's ambassador to the Arab League, and later he served as ambassador to Canada until 1985.|$|R
5|$|On October 6, 1973, Egypt {{launched}} Operation Badr, {{which started}} the Yom-Kippur War. It succeeded in crossing the Suez Canal and establishing bridgeheads {{on the east}} bank in Israeli-occupied Sinai, and counter-attacks by launched by Israeli reserves were unsuccessful. By October 10, fighting along the front {{had come to a}} lull. <b>Egyptian</b> <b>President</b> Anwar Sadat soon ordered an offensive to seize the strategic Sinai mountain passes, despite protests and objections by his senior commanders against such an offensive. Sadat hoped to divert Israeli pressure from the Syrians. The October 14 offensive was ill-planned and ill-executed, and culminated in heavy Egyptian losses without achieving any objectives.|$|E
5|$|West German government. After {{a lengthy}} investigation, it was {{determined}} that another negative existed in East Germany and it was used it to make prints that were dubbed in Arabic and distributed in Middle Eastern countries such as Egypt and Lebanon. Though that negative has never been located, it has been widely suspected that this version was produced and distributed by the Stasi or the KGB in order to arouse anti-semitism among Egyptian and Palestinians against the US-backed Israel (and henceforth, support for the Soviet-backed <b>Egyptian</b> <b>president</b> Gamal Abdel Nasser).|$|E
5|$|Al-Shifa Hospital ("the Cure") {{was founded}} in the Rimal District by the British Mandate {{government}} in the 1940s. Housed in an army barracks, it originally provided quarantine and treatment for febrile diseases. When Egypt administered Gaza, this original department was relocated and al-Shifa became the city's central hospital. When Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip after occupying it in the 1956 Suez Crisis, <b>Egyptian</b> <b>president</b> Gamal Abdel Nasser had al-Shifa hospital expanded and improved. He also ordered {{the establishment of a}} second hospital in the Nasser District with the same name. In 1957, the quarantine and febrile disease hospital was rebuilt and named Nasser Hospital. Today, al-Shifa remains Gaza's largest medical complex.|$|E

When he met singer and {{composer}} Sheikh Imam in Khosh Adam neighborhood, they became roommates and formed a famous signing duet.

50|$|The law {{creating}} the Israel Broadcasting Authority {{was passed by}} the Knesset on 6 June 1965, with the television channel starting broadcasts on 2 May 1968. Initially in black and white, colour television was used from 13 January 1982, although occasional colour transmissions had been made earlier, most notably the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>president's</b> visit to Israel in 1977 and the Eurovision Song Contest 1979.|$|R
40|$|Following the {{overthrow}} of the Tunisian and <b>Egyptian</b> <b>presidents</b> in the last two months, the Arab uprisings appear to have stalled. Across the Middle East, the region’s leaders appear to have absorbed the lessons of Tunis and Cairo quickly in order to remain in power. The use of state repression, including security forces to remove demonstrators and the arrest of dissidents has occurred at a growing rate over the past month...|$|R
5|$|Quwatli was reelected in 1948, but was toppled in a {{military}} coup in 1949. He subsequently went into exile in Egypt, returning to Syria in 1955 {{to participate in the}} presidential election, which he won. A conservative presiding over an increasingly leftist-dominated government, Quwatli officially adopted neutralism amid the Cold War. After his request for aid from the United States was denied, he drew closer to the Eastern bloc. He also entered Syria into a defense arrangement with Egypt and Saudi Arabia to confront the influence of the Baghdad Pact. In 1957, Quwatli, who the US and the Pact countries attempted but failed to oust, sought to stem the leftist tide in Syria, but to no avail. By then, his political authority had receded as the military bypassed Quwatli's jurisdiction by independently coordinating with Quwatli's erstwhile ally, <b>Egyptian</b> <b>president</b> Gamal Abdel Nasser.|$|E
5|$|While {{leading the}} Allied Forces during World War I, the British won {{control of the}} city during the Third Battle of Gaza in 1917. After the war, Gaza was {{included}} in Mandatory Palestine. In the 1930s and 1940s, Gaza underwent major expansion. New neighborhoods were built along the coast and the southern and eastern plains. International organizations and missionary groups funded most of this construction. In the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan, Gaza was assigned {{to be part of}} an Arab state in Palestine but was occupied by Egypt following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Gaza's growing population was augmented by an influx of refugees fleeing nearby cities, towns and villages that were captured by Israel. In 1957, <b>Egyptian</b> <b>president</b> Gamal Abdel Nasser made a number of reforms in Gaza, which included expanding educational opportunities and the civil services, providing housing, and establishing local security forces.|$|E
5|$|Abu Nuwar's enmity with Glubb Pasha, the Arab Legion's {{powerful}} British {{chief of}} staff, his insistence on establishing Arab command over {{the army and}} his influence with Hussein led the latter to dismiss Glubb Pasha and appoint Abu Nuwar in his place. However, Abu Nuwar's ardent support for the pan-Arabist policies of <b>Egyptian</b> <b>president</b> Gamal Abdel Nasser contributed to Jordan's increasing isolation from the UK and the US, which were major sources of foreign aid to Jordan. At the same time, existing dissatisfaction with Abu Nuwar's leadership by palace officials and veteran Bedouin army units culminated into violent confrontations at the large army barracks in Zarqa between royalist and Arab nationalist units. Two principal accounts emerged regarding the events at Zarqa, with the royalist version holding that the incident was an abortive coup by Abu Nuwar against Hussein, and the dissident version asserting {{that it was a}} staged, American-backed counter-coup by Hussein against the pan-Arabist movement in Jordan. In any case, Abu Nuwar resigned and was allowed to leave Jordan for Syria. He was subsequently sentenced to 15 years in absentia.|$|E

5|$|On October 6, 1973, an Arab {{coalition}} led by Egypt and Syria, supported {{with arms}} and materiel by the Soviet Union, attacked Israel in the Yom Kippur War. Israel suffered heavy losses and Nixon ordered an airlift to resupply Israeli losses, cutting through inter-departmental squabbles and bureaucracy and taking {{personal responsibility for}} any response by Arab nations. More than a week later, {{by the time the}} U.S. and Soviet Union began negotiating a truce, Israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory. The truce negotiations rapidly escalated into a superpower crisis; when Israel gained the upper hand, <b>Egyptian</b> <b>President</b> Sadat requested a joint U.S.-USSR peacekeeping mission, which the U.S. refused. When Soviet Premier Brezhnev threatened to unilaterally enforce any peacekeeping mission militarily, Nixon ordered the U.S. military to DEFCON3, placing all U.S. military personnel and bases on alert for nuclear war. This was the closest that the world had come to nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis. Brezhnev backed down as a result of Nixon's actions.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{withdrawal}} of Israeli forces, <b>Egyptian</b> <b>president</b> Gamal Abdel Nasser issued several reforms in Gaza, including the expansion of educational opportunities and civil services, provision of housing {{and the establishment of}} local security forces. As in Egypt, political activity in Gaza was severely curtailed, but the government-sponsored Arab National Union was established in place of the All-Palestine Government that Nasser abolished in 1959, which gave the city's citizens a greater voice in national politics. In 1959, with the abolishment of the All-Palestine Government, Gaza had officially {{become a part of the}} United Arab Republic, a union of Syria and Egypt, under the pan-Arab policy of Nasser. In reality however, Gaza turned to be under direct Egyptian military governorship, which also continued upon {{the withdrawal}} of Syria from the UAR shortly afterwards. When the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) was founded in 1964, Nasser formally, but not practically, proclaimed that it would hold authority over Gaza, and a year later, conscription was instituted for the Palestinian Liberation Army.|$|E

He was sent to Israel where he negotiated the terms for the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>President's</b> visit. His colleague in those preparations was Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who later {{went on to become}} Secretary-General of the United Nations. El-Baz represented the Arab nationalist, while Boutros-Ghali was a cautious pro-Westerner.|$|R
50|$|Hussein Mahmoud Hassan el-Shafei, (حسين محمود حسن الشافعي), {{also known}} as Hussein el-Shafei (8 February 1918 - 18 November 2005), {{was a member of}} Egypt's 1952 revolutionary {{leadership}} council and served as Vice-president under two <b>Egyptian</b> <b>presidents,</b> Gamal Abdel Nasser and Anwar Sadat.

50|$|The Egyptian Armed Forces {{initially}} {{enjoyed a}} better public reputation than the police did; the former {{was seen as}} a professional body protecting the country, and the latter was accused of systemic corruption and lawless violence. However, when the SCAF cracked down on protesters after becoming the de facto ruler of Egypt the military's popularity decreased. All four <b>Egyptian</b> <b>presidents</b> since the 1950s have a military background. Key Egyptian military personnel include defense minister Mohamed Hussein Tantawi and armed forces chief of staff Sami Hafez Enan. The Egyptian military numbers about 468,500 active personnel, plus a reserve of 479,000.|$|R

5000|$|Relations have {{improved}} significantly between Israel and Egypt after the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état, with close military cooperation over the Sinai insurgency.

These developments, along with deteriorating Israel-Jordan relations, have led some to brand Egypt as Israel's [...] "closest ally" [...] in the Arab world, while others assert that relations remain relatively cold.
