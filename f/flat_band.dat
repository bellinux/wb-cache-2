25|$|Like the Doric Order, the Ionic Order retains {{signs of}} having {{its origins in}} wooden architecture. The {{horizontal}} spread of a flat timber plate {{across the top of}} a column is a common device in wooden construction, giving a thin upright a wider area on which to bear the lintel, {{while at the same time}} reinforcing the load-bearing strength of the lintel itself. Likewise, the columns always have bases, a necessity in wooden architecture to spread the load and protect the base of a comparatively thin upright. The columns are fluted with narrow, shallow flutes that do not meet at a sharp edge but have a <b>flat</b> <b>band</b> or fillet between them. The usual number of flutes is twenty-four but there may be as many as forty-four. The base has two convex mouldings called torus, and from the late Hellenic period stood on a square plinth similar to the abacus.|$|E

40|$|The Dirac <b>bands</b> and <b>flat</b> <b>bands</b> are {{difficult}} to coexist because they represent two extreme ends of electronic properties.

40|$|We report two new {{classes of}} face-centered {{photonic}} square lattices with <b>flat</b> <b>bands</b> {{which we call}} the Lieb-I and the Lieb-II lattices. There are 5 and 7 sites in the corresponding unit cells of the simplest Lieb-I and Lieb-II lattices, respectively. The number of <b>flat</b> <b>bands</b> $m$ in the new Lieb lattices {{is related to the}} number of sites $N$ in the unit cell by $m=(N- 1) / 2 $. Physical properties of the lattices with even and odd number of <b>flat</b> <b>bands</b> are different. We also consider localization of light in such Lieb lattices. If the input beam excites the flat-band mode, it will not diffract during propagation, owing to the strong localization in the flat-band mode. For the Lieb-II lattice, we also find that the beam will oscillate and still not diffract during propagation, because of the intrinsic oscillating properties of certain flat-band modes. The period of oscillation is determined by the energy difference between the two <b>flat</b> <b>bands.</b> This study provides a new platform for the investigation of flat-band modes.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{analytically}} capture and identify peculiarities {{in the electronic}} structure of silicene, Weaire-Thorpe(WT) model, a standard model for treating three-dimensional (3 D) silicon, is applied to silicene with the buckled 2 D structure. In the original WT model for four hybridized sp^ 3 orbitals on each atom along with inter-atom hopping, the band structure can be systematically examined in 3 D, where <b>flat</b> (dispersionless) <b>bands</b> exist as well. For examining silicene, here we re-formulate the WT model {{in terms of the}} overlapping molecular-orbital (MO) method which enables us to describe <b>flat</b> <b>bands</b> away from the electron-holesymmetric point. The overlapping MO formalism indeed enables us to reveal an important difference: while in 3 D the dipersive bands with cones are sandwiched by doubly-degenerate <b>flat</b> <b>bands,</b> in 2 D the dipersive bands with cones are sandwiched by triply-degenerate and non-degenerate (nearly) <b>flat</b> <b>bands,</b> which is consistent with the original band calculation by Takeda and Shiraishi. Thus emerges a picture for why the whole band structure of silicene comprises a pair of dispersive bands with Dirac cones with each of the band touching a nearly <b>flat</b> (narrow) <b>band</b> at Γ. We can also recognize that, for band engineering, the bonds perpendicular to the atomic plane are crucial, and that a ferromagnetism or structural instabilities are expected if we can shift the chemical potential close to the <b>flat</b> <b>bands.</b> Comment: 13 pages, 3 figures (final version) to appear in NJ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{thorough}} tight-binding {{analysis of the}} band structure {{of a wide variety}} of lattices belonging to the class of honeycomb and Kagome systems including several mixed forms combining both lattices. The band structure of these systems are made of a combination of dispersive and <b>flat</b> <b>bands.</b> The dispersive bands possess Dirac cones (linear dispersion) at the six corners (K points) of the Brillouin zone although in peculiar cases Dirac cones at the center of the zone (Γ point) appear. The <b>flat</b> <b>bands</b> can be of different nature. Most of them are tangent to the dispersive bands at the center of the zone but some, for symmetry reasons, do not hybridize with other states. The objective of our work is to provide an analysis of a wide class of so-called ligand-decorated honeycomb Kagome lattices that are observed in 2 D metal-organic framework (MOF) where the ligand occupy honeycomb sites and the metallic atoms the Kagome sites.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{properties}} of the surface states in three-dimensional topological insulators {{in the presence of a}} ferromagnetic exchange field. We demonstrate that for layered materials like Bi$_ 2 $Se$_ 3 $ the surface states on the top surface behave qualitatively different than the surface states at the side surfaces. We show that the group velocity of the surface states can be tuned by the direction and strength of the exchange field. If the exchange field becomes larger than the bulk gap of the material, a phase transition into a topologically nontrivial semimetallic state occurs. In particular, the material becomes a Weyl semimetal, if the exchange field possesses a non-zero component perpendicular to the layers. Associated with the Weyl semimetallic state we show that Fermi arcs appear at the surface. Under certain circumstances either one-dimensional or even two-dimensional surface <b>flat</b> <b>bands</b> can appear. We show that the appearence of these <b>flat</b> <b>bands</b> is related to chiral symmetries of the system and can be understood in terms of topological winding numbers. In contrast to previous systems that have been suggested to possess surface <b>flat</b> <b>bands,</b> the present system has a much larger energy scale, allowing the observation of surface <b>flat</b> <b>bands</b> at room temperature. The <b>flat</b> <b>bands</b> are tunable in the sense that they can be turned on or off by rotation of the ferromagnetic exchange field. Our findings are supported by both numerical results on a finite system as well as approximate analytical results. Comment: 45 pages, 17 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that <b>flat</b> <b>bands</b> with local Berry curvature arise naturally in chiral (ABC) multilayer graphene {{placed on a}} boron nitride (BN) substrate. The degree of flatness can be tuned by varying the number of graphene layers N. For N = 7 the <b>bands</b> become nearly <b>flat,</b> with a small bandwidth of 3. 6 meV. The two nearly <b>flat</b> <b>bands</b> coming from the K and K' valleys cross along lines in the reduced zone. Weak intervalley tunneling turns the bandcrossing into an avoided crossing, producing two nearly <b>flat</b> <b>bands</b> with global Chern number zero, but with local Berry curvature. The flatness of the bands suggests that many body effects will dominate the physics, while the local Berry curvature of the bands endows the system with a nontrivial quantum geometry. The quantum geometry effects manifest themselves through the quantum distance (Fubini-Study) metric, rather than the more conventional Chern number. Multilayer graphene on BN thus provides a platform for investigating the effect of interactions in a system with a non-trivial quantum distance metric, without the complication of non-zero Chern numbers. We note in passing that <b>flat</b> <b>bands</b> with non-zero Chern number can also be realized by making use of magnetic adatoms, and explicitly breaking time reversal symmetry...|$|R

The signal is then immediately amplified to remove the danger of contamination by signal noise, and then a compensation of the 6 dB/oct slope is done by derivator element on the programming pins of an NE592 video amplifier.
