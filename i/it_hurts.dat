So that no further harm will be done, I would like to ask everyone to get behind the team and to help the boys win from the New York Rangers and Detroit. I will take my punishment and come back next year to help the club and the younger players to win the Cup.|$|E

5|$|Many mental states {{seem to be}} {{experienced}} subjectively in different ways by different individuals. And it is characteristic of a mental state that it has some experiential quality, e.g. of pain, that <b>it</b> <b>hurts.</b> However, the sensation of pain between two individuals may not be identical, since {{no one has a}} perfect way to measure how much something hurts or of describing exactly how it feels to hurt. Philosophers and scientists therefore ask where these experiences come from. The existence of cerebral events, in and of themselves, cannot explain why they are accompanied by these corresponding qualitative experiences. The puzzle of why many cerebral processes occur with an accompanying experiential aspect in consciousness seems impossible to explain.|$|E

25|$|The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) {{went into}} effect on January 1, 1994, {{which led to the}} {{elimination}} of tariffs and other trade barriers between Mexico and the U.S. and serves as a multilateral platform for cooperation between both countries. The agreement increased trade volume and cooperation in both countries. The free trade agreement has been increasingly opposed by Mexican and U.S. farmers, with many groups and the political left presenting that <b>it</b> <b>hurts</b> the interest of traditional, small and local farmers in both countries. Allegations of violations of labor and environmental laws have been considered by the trilateral institutions. The Bush Administration argued that NAFTA had had modest positive impacts on all three member countries, but Mexican farmers have strongly criticized the effects of the agreement as they have become overshadowed by the large corporations benefiting from NAFTA. Notable bilateral trade disputes relate to trucking, tuna, sweeteners and anti-dumping measures.|$|E

On May 4, he had his worst start of his career against the Milwaukee Brewers at Dodger Stadium, {{throwing}} just 57 pitches in 1 innings, while retiring only four of the 13 batters he faced—including the pitcher. He was booed loudly upon being pulled from the game. Kershaw said after the game, [...] "I didn't give our team any kind of chance.

500|$|Nevertheless, {{numerous}} episodes featuring Van Dyke {{had already}} completed taping and {{would continue to}} air, meaning that {{the changes in the}} show's format would not be apparent to viewers for several weeks. [...] Accordingly, reviews about the show's format (as opposed to Garland's singing) continued to be negative, as the Garland-deprecating humor continued to attract criticism rather than viewers. Saturday Evening Post reviewer Richard Warren Lewis wrote, [...] "The absurd notion of debasing Judy's reputation as a legendary figure and molding her show into an imitation of other prosaic variety shows has been a disaster where <b>it</b> <b>hurts</b> most, in the audience-rating polls." [...] Indeed, Garland's show was averaging an 18 rating, about half of the audience represented by Bonanza and its 35 rating.|$|E

[...] Kenneth Silber from Space.com, although complimentary towards the focus on Samantha Mulder, was critical of the slowness of the episode, writing, [...] "While the series' reversion to its central theme is much appreciated, this episode unfolds with an unfortunate slowness that does little to satisfy the seven-year itch many X-Files viewers have come to feel in response to monster-of-the-week episodes and phony-baloney mythology cliffhangers." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{growth of}} lesbian {{feminism}} in the 1970s at times so conflicted with the gay liberation movement that some lesbians refused {{to work with}} gay men. Many lesbians found men's attitudes patriarchal and chauvinistic, and saw in gay men the same misguided notions about women as they saw in heterosexual men. The issues most important to gay men—entrapment and public solicitation—were not shared by lesbians. In 1977 a Lesbian Pride Rally was organized {{as an alternative to}} sharing gay men's issues, especially what Adrienne Rich termed [...] "the violent, self-destructive world of the gay bars". Veteran gay activist Barbara Gittings chose to work in the gay rights movement, rationalizing [...] "It's a matter of where does it hurt the most?
