5|$|Doggett, searching in the salvage yard, finds a Chamber Technologies drum, {{inside of}} which is a metal corpse. When Scully and Doggett confront Pugovel about it, he admits it was Dr. Clifton, a doctor who mysteriously disappeared. He had {{requested}} that he be put in the barrel in order to not ruin the company or slow the research. Doggett and Scully realize that Ray was exposed to the barrel, and thus was transformed into a metal human. At the same time, Doggett notices Nora Pearce at the lab, looking through files for the person responsible. Later, the halfway house is raided by the FBI to find Pearce. Larina finds Ray and he puts one hand over <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> muffle, but he kills her by accident.|$|E
25|$|The mimicry of egg-spots is {{utilized}} by males for the fertilization process. Mouthbrooding females lay eggs and immediately snatch {{them up with}} their mouths. Over millions of years, male cichlids have evolved egg-spots to initiate the fertilization process more efficiently. When the females are snatching up the eggs into their mouth, the males gyrate their anal fins, which illuminates the egg-spots on his tail. Afterwards, the female, believing these are her eggs, places <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> the anal fin (specifically the genital papilla) of the male, which is when he discharges sperm into her mouth and fertilizes the eggs.|$|E
2500|$|In {{laboratory}} observations, it {{was found}} that bronze corydoras have a unique method of insemination. When these fish reproduce, the male will present his abdomen to the female. The female will attach <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> the male's genital opening, creating the well-known [...] "T-position" [...] many Corydoras exhibit during courtship. The female will then drink the sperm. The sperm rapidly moves through her intestines and is discharged together with her eggs into a pouch formed by her pelvic fins. The female can then swim away and deposit the pouch somewhere else alone. Because the T-position is exhibited in other species than just C. aeneus, it is likely that they also exhibit this behavior. In the wild, eggs are laid on waterweeds.|$|E

2500|$|On 3 September 1981 Chikatilo {{encountered}} a 17-year-old boarding school student, named Larisa Tkachenko, {{standing at a}} bus stop as he exited a public library in Rostov city centre. According to his subsequent confession, Chikatilo lured Tkachenko to a forest near the Don River with the pretext of drinking vodka and [...] "relaxing". When they reached a secluded area, he threw the girl to the ground before tearing off her clothes and attempting intercourse, as Tkachenko remonstrated against his actions. When Chikatilo failed to achieve an erection, he forced mud inside <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> stifle her screams before battering and strangling her to death. As he had no knife, Chikatilo mutilated the body with his teeth and a stick; he also tore one nipple from Tkachenko's body with his teeth, before loosely covering her body with leaves, branches, and torn pages of newspaper. Tkachenko's body was found the following day.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the show}} itself was greatly lauded by some critics: Vernon Rice of the New York Post proclaimed, [...] "Irving Berlin has outdone himself this time. No use {{trying to pick}} a hit tune, for all the tunes are hits...Ethel Merman is at her lusty, free and easy best...She is now able to develop a {{consistent}} characterization and stay with it to the show's end. And when she opens <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> sing, she sings!" [...] William Hawkins of the New York World-Telegram said that Merman was [...] "bright as a whip, sure as her shooting, and generously the foremost lady clown of her time" [...] and asserted that the show itself was {{comparable to those of}} Rodgers and Hammerstein, proclaiming, [...] "For verve and buoyancy, unslackening, there has seldom if ever been a show like it...the girls in Annie have the beauty and character of looks one associates with a Rodgers and Hammerstein show. And the production has in every way the distinction that has become their hallmark".|$|E
2500|$|As in all crocodilian species, {{the female}} {{saltwater}} crocodile exhibits a remarkable level of maternal {{care for a}} reptile. She excavates the nest in response to [...] "yelping" [...] calls from the hatchlings, and even gently rolls eggs in <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> assist hatching. The female will then carry the hatchlings to water in her mouth (as Nile crocodile and American alligator females have been observed doing when their eggs hatch) and remains with the young for several months. Despite her diligence, losses of baby crocodiles are heavy due to various predators and unrelated crocodiles of their own species. Only approximately 1% of the hatchlings will survive to adulthood. By crocodilian standards, saltwater crocodile hatchlings are exceptionally aggressive {{to one another and}} will often fight almost immediately after being transported to water by their mother. The young naturally start to disperse after around 8 months, and start to exhibit territorial behaviour at around 2.5-years-old. They are the most territorial of extant crocodilians and, due to their aggressiveness to conspecifics, from the dispersed immature stage on, they are never seen in concentrations or loose groups as are most other crocodilians. However, even females will not reach proper sexual maturity for another 10 years. Saltwater crocodiles that survive to adulthood can attain a very long lifespan, with an estimated life expectancy upwards of 70 years, and some individuals possibly exceed 100 years, although no such extreme ages have been verified for any crocodilian.|$|E

5000|$|Like the komainu ("lion dogs"), the shisa are a {{variation}} of the guardian lions ("fu dogs") from China. From the Edo period, they started to be called [...] "guardian dogs" [...] in general in mainland Japan. Gender is variously assigned to the shisa. Some Okinawans believe the male has his <b>mouth</b> closed <b>to</b> keep bad out of the home, while the female has <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> open <b>to</b> share goodness. Others believe the female has <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> closed <b>to</b> [...] "keep in the good", while the male has his <b>mouth</b> open <b>to</b> [...] "scare away the bad". (Compare this to the distinction between male and female guardian lions in Chinese culture.) ...|$|R

2500|$|Before Radish {{became a}} Buddhist, he went abroad on {{business}} {{and gave his}} mother money for feeding monks and beggars. She stingily hides it away, and soon after Radish returns, dies and the Jade Emperor judges {{that she should be}} turned over to Yama, ruler of the underworld, and dropped to the lowest order of hell for her selfish deception. [...] Mulian becomes a Buddhist and uses his new powers to travel to heaven. There his father informs him that his mother is suffering extremely in the Avīci Hell, the cruelest of the purgatories. Mulian descends and meets ox-headed devils who force sinners to cross the river to hell and to embrace hot copper pillars that burn away their chests. But by the time Mulian locates his mother she has been nailed down with forty-nine iron spikes. [...] He seeks Buddha's help and is given a rod to smash prison walls and release the prisoners of hell to a higher reincarnation, but his mother is not released. Mulian's mother is reborn as a hungry ghost who can never eat her fill because her neck is too thin. Mulian tries to send her food by placing it on the ancestral altar, but the food bursts into flame just as it reaches <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> <b>To</b> rescue her from this torture, the Buddha instructs Mulian and all filial sons to provide a grand feast of [...] "yülan bowls" [...] on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, the time when monks emerge from their summer retreat. When his mother is reincarnated once gain, this time as a black dog, Mulian recites sutras for seven days and seven nights, and his mother is reborn as a human again. In the end she is reborn again and can attain the joys of heaven.|$|E
