5|$|Unlike {{some other}} states, {{there are no}} <b>formal</b> <b>rules</b> prohibiting the usage of the same route number under {{different}} systems. Motorists using Michigan's highways may encounter I-75 and M-75, as well as both US8 and M-8. Many of the state's US Highways were assigned numbers duplicating those of state trunklines when the US Highway System was created in 1926. The introduction of the Interstate Highway System in the late 1950s further complicated the situation, as each mainline Interstate designation has an unrelated M-n trunkline counterpart elsewhere in the state.|$|E
5|$|In {{opposition}} to the formal theories of the generative school, functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. Formal theories of grammar seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they {{relate to each other}} as systems of <b>formal</b> <b>rules</b> or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out. The framework of cognitive linguistics interprets language in terms of the concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.|$|E
5|$|Kilmer is {{considered}} among {{the last of the}} Romantic era poets because his verse is conservative and traditional in style and does not break any of the <b>formal</b> <b>rules</b> of poetics—a style often criticized today for being too sentimental to be taken seriously. The entire corpus of Kilmer's work was produced between 1909 and 1918 when Romanticism and sentimental lyric poetry fell out of favor and Modernism took root—especially with the influence of the Lost Generation. In the years after Kilmer's death, poetry went in drastically different directions, as is seen in the work of T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound, and academic criticism grew with it to eschew the more sentimental and straightforward verse.|$|E
40|$|The current {{scholarly}} {{focus on}} informal amendment has obscured the continuing relevance of <b>formal</b> amendment <b>rules.</b> In this Article, I return {{our attention to}} formal amendment {{in order to show}} that <b>formal</b> amendment <b>rules</b> – not <b>formal</b> amendments but <b>formal</b> amendment <b>rules</b> themselves – perform an underappreciated function: to express constitutional values. Drawing from national constitutions, in particular the Canadian, South African, German and United States Constitutions, I illustrate how constitutional designers may deploy <b>formal</b> amendment <b>rules</b> to create a formal constitutional hierarchy that reflects special political commitments. That <b>formal</b> amendment <b>rules</b> may express constitutional values is both a clarifying and complicating contribution to the study of <b>formal</b> amendment <b>rules.</b> It clarifies the study of <b>formal</b> amendment <b>rules</b> by showing that <b>formal</b> amendment <b>rules</b> may serve a function that scholars have yet to attribute to them. Yet it complicates the study of <b>formal</b> amendment <b>rules</b> by showing that the constitutional text alone cannot prove whether the constitutional values expressed in <b>formal</b> amendment <b>rules</b> represent authentic or inauthentic political commitments...|$|R

40|$|No {{part of a}} {{constitution}} {{is more important than}} the rules that govern its amendment and its entrenchment against it. Given the important functions served by <b>formal</b> constitutional amendment <b>rules,</b> we might expect constitutional designers to entrench them against ordinary amendment, for instance by requiring a higher-than-usual quantum of agreement for their amendment or by making them altogether unamendable. Yet relatively few constitutional democracies set a higher threshold for formally amending <b>formal</b> amendment <b>rules.</b> In this Article, I demonstrate that existing written and unwritten limits to formally amending <b>formal</b> amendment <b>rules</b> are unsatisfactory, and I offer modest textual entrenchment strategies to insulate <b>formal</b> amendment <b>rules</b> against ordinary <b>formal</b> amendment in constitutional democracies where the constitutional text exerts an appreciable constraint on political actors.

My central intent is to pose questions for further study (by myself and others) regarding the historical behavior of the jury, the jury’s role in reinforcing notions of political liberty and free will, and, primarily, how scholarly conceptions of the jury’s role and behavior have informed elite theory regarding the justifications for imposing criminal responsibility...|$|R
25|$|Functional {{theories}} of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, {{it is reasonable}} to assume that its structures are best analysed and understood with reference to the functions they carry out.

This means that functional theories of grammar tend to pay attention to the way language is actually used, and not just to the formal relations between linguistic elements.|$|E
25|$|Many {{transitions}} involving {{electromagnetic radiation}} are strictly forbidden under quantum mechanics. The allowed transitions are described by so-called selection rules, which describe {{the conditions under}} which a radiative transition is allowed. For instance, transitions are only allowed if ΔS=0, S being the total spin angular momentum of the system. In real materials other effects, such as interactions with the crystal lattice, intervene to circumvent the <b>formal</b> <b>rules</b> by providing alternate mechanisms. In these systems the forbidden transitions can occur, but usually at slower rates than allowed transitions. A classic example is phosphorescence where a material has a ground state with S=0, an excited state with S=0, and an intermediate state with S=1. The transition from the intermediate state to the ground state by emission of light is slow because of the selection rules. Thus emission may continue after the external illumination is removed. In contrast fluorescence in materials is characterized by emission which ceases when the external illumination is removed.|$|E
25|$|In {{various forms}} {{the game has}} been played since the early 20th Century in Canada as a {{recreational}} sport, especially in high school gymnasiums, as a playful variant of hockey, where the sticks got their form from the hockey game bandy. Most Canadian males born in the 1950s and before could attest to this. Similarly, during the 1950s and 1960s many public school systems within Michigan incorporated floorball into their primary and secondary school gym classes. Later, Americans claimed to have invented it, and held interstate tournaments in the 1960s. The game was formally organized as an international and more organised sport in the late 1970s in Gothenburg, Sweden. The sport began as something that was played for fun as a pastime in schools. After a decade or so, floorball began showing up in Nordic countries where the former schoolyard pastime was becoming a developed sport. <b>Formal</b> <b>rules</b> soon were developed, and clubs began to form. After some time, several countries developed national associations, and the IFF was founded in 1986.|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} of <b>formal</b> constitutional amendment <b>rules</b> has received little scholarly attention. Constitutional designers therefore have few academic resources {{to guide them}} in designing the <b>rules</b> of <b>formal</b> amendment — {{perhaps the most important}} part of any constitution. In this Article, I fill that void by creating a new classification of <b>formal</b> amendment <b>rules</b> based on my analysis of <b>formal</b> amendment <b>rules</b> in constitutional democracies. I explain and illustrate that <b>formal</b> amendment <b>rules</b> are conceptually structured in three tiers: (1) foundations, which either entrench or are silent on the distinction between constitutional amendment and revision; (2) frameworks, consisting of one of six combinations of comprehensive, restricted or exceptional single-track or multi-track procedures; and (3) specifications, which supplement amendment foundations and frameworks with voting thresholds, quorum requirements, subject-matter restrictions, temporal requirements, electoral preconditions and defense mechanisms. I also show how constitutional designers may use this classification to manage federalism, express constitutional values, enhance or diminish the judicial role, and pursue democratic outcomes related to governance, constitutional endurance, and amendment difficulty. My larger purpose is to enliven the study of <b>formal</b> amendment <b>rules</b> by generating a research agenda into their structure and uses, and the options they present to constitutional designers...|$|R
