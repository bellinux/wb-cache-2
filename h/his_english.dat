5|$|After {{the murder}} of Archbishop Thomas Becket at the cathedral in 1170, Canterbury {{became one of the}} most notable towns in Europe, as pilgrims from all parts of Christendom came to visit his shrine.

5|$|Two {{approaches}} have dominated {{explanations of the}} story of the green children: that it is a folktale describing an imaginary encounter with the inhabitants of another world, perhaps subterranean or even extraterrestrial, or it is a garbled account of a historical event.

5|$|After Roger's birth, James and Henriette {{had three}} more children: two daughters {{who died in}} infancy and a second son, Alfred, born in 1839. The {{marriage}} was unhappy, and the couple spent much time apart, he in England, she in Paris with Roger. As a consequence of his upbringing, Roger spoke mainly French, and <b>his</b> <b>English</b> was heavily accented. In 1845 James decided that Roger should complete his education in England and placed him in the Jesuit boarding school Stonyhurst College, where he remained until 1848. In 1849 he sat the British army entrance examinations and then took a commission in the 6th Dragoon Guards, in which he served for three years, mainly in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Benchley {{enrolled}} at Harvard University in 1908, again with Duryea's financial help. He joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity {{in his first}} year, and continued to partake in the camaraderie that he had enjoyed at Phillips Exeter while still doing well in school. He did especially well in <b>his</b> <b>English</b> and government classes. His humor and style began to reveal themselves during this time: Benchley was {{often called upon to}} entertain his fraternity brothers, and his impressions of classmates and professors became very popular. His performances gave him some local fame, and most entertainment programs on campus and many off-campus meetings recruited Benchley's talents.|$|E
5|$|Between 1893 and 1897, {{the years}} when Bauer and Nold were also in the Western Penitentiary for their part in the {{assassination}} attempt, the three men surreptitiously produced 60 issues of a hand-written anarchist newsletter by transferring their work from cell to cell. They managed to send the completed newsletters, which they called Prison Blossoms, to friends outside the prison. Participating in Prison Blossoms, initially written in German and later in English, helped Berkman improve <b>his</b> <b>English.</b> He developed a friendship with the prison chaplain, John Lynn Milligan, who was a strong advocate {{on behalf of the}} prison library. Milligan encouraged Berkman to read books from the library, a process that furthered his knowledge of English.|$|E

5|$|By October 1760, George II {{was blind}} in one eye, and hard of hearing. On {{the morning of}} 25 October, he rose as usual at 6:00am, drank {{a cup of hot}} chocolate, and went to his close stool, alone. After a few minutes, his valet heard a loud crash. He entered the room to find the king on the floor. The king was lifted into his bed, and Princess Amelia was sent for, but before she reached him, he was dead. At the age of nearly 77, he had lived longer than any of <b>his</b> <b>English</b> or British predecessors. A {{post-mortem}} revealed that the right ventricle of the king's heart had ruptured as the result of an incipient aortic aneurysm.|$|E
5|$|During most of de Coventre's {{recorded}} lifetime Scotland {{was ruled}} by King David II. Coming {{to the throne}} at age five, King David was driven into exile in France {{at the age of}} ten. In the 1330s, civil war raged in Scotland as those loyal to David fought Edward Balliol and <b>his</b> <b>English</b> backers. In some sense, the conflict became a side-show of the Hundred Years' War, and David resided at Château Gaillard in northern France for much of his exile, until he could return to Scotland in 1341. In 1346, in response to a plea from France to come to its aid, David led an army into England only to be taken prisoner at Neville's Cross; he remained in captivity until he was ransomed in 1357. David's exile in France corresponded with Walter's own period in that country, prompting one historian to suggest that Walter was part of David's court while both were in northern France, and that Walter subsequently benefited from the relationship.|$|E
