5|$|Structural {{alignment}} {{techniques have}} traditionally been applied exclusively to proteins, as the primary biological macromolecules that assume characteristic three-dimensional structures. However, large RNA molecules also form characteristic tertiary structures, which are mediated primarily by hydrogen bonds formed between base pairs as well as base stacking. Functionally similar noncoding RNA molecules can be especially difficult to extract from genomics data because structure is more strongly conserved than sequence in RNA {{as well as in}} proteins, and the more limited alphabet of RNA decreases the <b>information</b> <b>content</b> of any given nucleotide at any given position.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} {{astronomer}} Steven J. Dick at the United States Naval Observatory considered the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact by analyzing events of similar {{significance in the}} history of science. The study argues that the impact would be most strongly influenced by the <b>information</b> <b>content</b> of the message received, if any. It distinguishes short-term and long-term impact. Seeing radio-based contact as a more plausible scenario than a visit from extraterrestrial spacecraft, the study rejects the commonly stated analogy of European colonization of the Americas as an accurate model for information-only contact, preferring events of profound scientific significance, such as the Copernican and Darwinian revolutions, as more predictive of how humanity might be impacted by extraterrestrial contact.|$|E
5|$|In Escherichia coli, SOS {{boxes are}} 20-nucleotide long {{sequences}} near promoters with palindromic structure {{and a high}} degree of sequence conservation. In other classes and phyla, the sequence of SOS boxes varies considerably, with different length and composition, but it is always highly conserved and one of the strongest short signals in the genome. The high <b>information</b> <b>content</b> of SOS boxes permits differential binding of LexA to different promoters and allows for timing of the SOS response. The lesion repair genes are induced at the beginning of SOS response. The error-prone translesion polymerases, for example, UmuCD'2 (also called DNA polymerase V), are induced later on as a last resort. Once the DNA damage is repaired or bypassed using polymerases or through recombination, the amount of single-stranded DNA in cells is decreased, lowering the amounts of RecA filaments decreases cleavage activity of LexA homodimer, which then binds to the SOS boxes near promoters and restores normal gene expression.|$|E

40|$|Quantum information, {{though not}} {{precisely}} defined, {{is a fundamental}} concept of quantum information theory which predicts many fascinating phenomena and provides new physical resources. A basic problem is to recognize the features of quantum systems responsible for those phenomena. One of such important features is that non-commuting quantum states cannot be broadcast: two copies cannot be obtained out of a single copy, not even reproduced marginally on separate systems. We focus on the difference of <b>information</b> <b>contents</b> between one copy and two copies which is a basic manifestation of the gap between quantum and classical information. We show that if the chosen information measure is the Holevo quantity, {{the difference between the}} <b>information</b> <b>contents</b> of one copy and two copies is zero if and only if the states can be broadcast. We propose a new approach in defining measures of quantumness of ensembles based on the difference of <b>information</b> <b>contents</b> between the original ensemble and the ensemble of duplicated states. We also provide an Appendix where we discuss the status of quantum information in quantum physics, basing on the so-called isomorphism principle...|$|R

They argue that bees instead are primarily recruited by odor.

25|$|Disregarding intermediates, {{the basic}} {{distinction}} between asexual and sexual reproduction {{is the way}} in which the genetic material is processed. Typically, prior to an asexual division, a cell duplicates its genetic <b>information</b> <b>content,</b> and then divides. This process of cell division is called mitosis. In sexual reproduction, there are special kinds of cells that divide without prior duplication of its genetic material, in a process named meiosis. The resulting cells are called gametes, and contain only half the genetic material of the parent cells. These gametes are the cells that are prepared for the sexual reproduction of the organism. Sex comprises the arrangements that enable sexual reproduction, and has evolved alongside the reproduction system, starting with similar gametes (isogamy) and progressing to systems that have different gamete types, such as those involving a large female gamete (ovum) and a small male gamete (sperm).|$|E
25|$|Entropy is {{a measure}} of unpredictability of the state, or equivalently, of its average <b>information</b> <b>content.</b> To get an {{intuitive}} understanding of these terms, consider the example of a political poll. Usually, such polls happen because the outcome of the poll is not already known. In other words, the outcome of the poll is relatively unpredictable, and actually performing the poll and learning the results gives some new information; these are just different ways of saying that the a priori entropy of the poll results is large. Now, consider the case that the same poll is performed a second time shortly after the first poll. Since the result of the first poll is already known, the outcome of the second poll can be predicted well and the results should not contain much new information; in this case the a priori entropy of the second poll result is small relative to that of the first.|$|E

25|$|The hypercycle is a {{cycle of}} connected, {{self-replicating}} macromolecules. In the hypercycle, all molecules are linked such that each of them catalyses the creation of its successor, with the last molecule catalysing the first one. In such a manner, the cycle reinforces itself. Furthermore, each molecule is additionally a subject for self-replication. The resultant system is {{a new level of}} self-organization that incorporates both cooperation and selfishness. The coexistence of many genetically non-identical molecules makes it possible to maintain a high genetic diversity of the population. This can be a solution to the error threshold problem, which states that, in a system without ideal replication, an excess of mutation events would destroy the ability to carry information and prevent the creation of larger and fitter macromolecules. Moreover, {{it has been shown that}} hypercycles could originate naturally and that incorporating new molecules can extend them. Hypercycles are also subject to evolution and, as such, can undergo a selection process. As a result, not only does the system gain information, but its <b>information</b> <b>content</b> can be improved. From an evolutionary point of view, the hypercycle is an intermediate state of self-organization, but not the final solution.|$|E
25|$|The {{optical effect}} of a TN device in the voltage-on state is far less {{dependent}} on variations in the device thickness than that in the voltage-off state. Because of this, TN displays with low <b>information</b> <b>content</b> and no backlighting are usually operated between crossed polarizers such that they appear bright with no voltage (the eye is much more sensitive to variations in the dark state than the bright state). As most of 2010-era LCDs are used in television sets, monitors and smartphones, they have high-resolution matrix arrays of pixels to display arbitrary images using backlighting with a dark background. When no image is displayed, different arrangements are used. For this purpose, TN LCDs are operated between parallel polarizers, whereas IPS LCDs feature crossed polarizers. In many applications IPS LCDs have replaced TN LCDs, in particular in smartphones such as iPhones. Both the liquid crystal material and the alignment layer material contain ionic compounds. If an electric field of one particular polarity is applied {{for a long period}} of time, this ionic material is attracted to the surfaces and degrades the device performance. This is avoided either by applying an alternating current or by reversing the polarity of the electric field as the device is addressed (the response of the liquid crystal layer is identical, regardless of the polarity of the applied field).|$|E
25|$|Protein NMR {{utilizes}} multidimensional nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} experiments to obtain information about the protein. Ideally, each distinct nucleus in the molecule experiences a distinct electronic environment and thus has a distinct chemical shift by which it can be recognized. However, in large molecules such as proteins the number of resonances can typically be several thousand and a one-dimensional spectrum inevitably has incidental overlaps. Therefore, multidimensional experiments that correlate the frequencies of distinct nuclei are performed. The additional dimensions decrease the chance of overlap and have a larger <b>information</b> <b>content,</b> since they correlate signals from nuclei within a specific part of the molecule. Magnetization is transferred into the sample using pulses of electromagnetic (radiofrequency) energy and between nuclei using delays; the process is described with so-called pulse sequences. Pulse sequences allow the experimenter to investigate and select specific types of connections between nuclei. The array of {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} experiments used on proteins fall in two main categories — one where magnetization is transferred through the chemical bonds, and one where the transfer is through space, irrespective of the bonding structure. The first category is used to assign the different chemical shifts to a specific nucleus, {{and the second is}} primarily used to generate the distance restraints used in the structure calculation, and in the assignment with unlabelled protein.|$|E
