40|$|Vegetable oils are {{important}} elements of the human diet because they contain <b>essential</b> <b>nutritional</b> <b>factors.</b> Due to the manufacturing processes or inadequate conditions of storage, they may also contain lipid oxidation products that are toxic to the body. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to test the protective effect of carotenoid-rich extracts obtained from the fruits of Hippophae rhamnoides on crude sunflower, pumpkin and olive oils oxidative processes. In order to evaluate the effect of antioxidant carotenoids, three stages were followed: thermal induction of lipid peroxidation in the presence of AAPH (2, 2 '-Azobis(2 -amidinopropane) dihydrochloride); determination of the level of lipid peroxidation in oxidized oils in the presence and absence of antioxidants, by quantifying the concentration of conjugated dienes and malonyl dialdehyde (MDA); determination of the level of lipid peroxidation by evaluating the profile of the fatty acids and the ratio between the saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (UFA / SFA), using an GC-MS method. In the case of sunflower oil, it was observed that sea buckthorn fruit extract significantly decreased MDA concentration but does not significantly reduce the concentration of conjugated dienes. The protective effect of carotenoids is more evident in the case of oil from pumpkin seeds. In the olive oil, unlike the first two types of oils, the carotenoids extract inhibits both the MDA and the conjugated dienes formation to a lesser extent, statistically insignificant. Overall, the ratio UFA / SFA decreases in crude oxidized oils. In the oils in which carotenoids were added was observed an increase in the UFA / SFA ratio. Carotenoids fraction from sea buckthorn fruits, rich in xanthophylls’ esters, possess a good antioxidant effect, protecting vegetable oils against peroxidation processes induced in the presence of AAP...|$|E

50|$|The next {{course of}} the {{infection}} differs in final and accidental hosts. In ducks, schistosomula are observed in synsacral segments of a spinal cord 3 DPI and 7-8 days latter (10-11 DPI) they reach the brain. In their final localisation (the nasal tissue), they occur 13-14 DPI and laying eggs starts 15 DPI. In mice, the first schistosomula are found in a lumbar spinal cord as early as 2 DPI and medulla oblongata is invaded the day after, but only in some individuals. Most of schistosomula stay localised in the thoracic and cervical spinal cord and only exceptionally migrate to the brain. Neither the presence of worms has been detected in a nasal cavity nor has their maturation been noticed in the nervous tissue. Schistosomula development in mice is suppressed likely due to the host immune response and/or the presence/absence of some <b>essential</b> (<b>nutritional,</b> stimulatory) host <b>factors.</b>|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the seroprevalence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) {{and its relationship}} to <b>nutritional</b> <b>factors</b> in female Vietnamese immigrants to Korea. METHODS: A total of 390 female immigrants from Vietnam and 206 Korean male spouses participated in the study. Blood samples from 321 female immigrants and 201 Korean male spouses were analyzed for H. pylori antibodies. Data on age, sex, alcohol consumption, smoking status, dietary <b>nutritional</b> <b>factors</b> and gastrointestinal symptoms were collected using questionnaires. The daily intakes of the following nutrients were estimated: energy, protein, niacin, lipid, fiber, calcium, iron, sodium, potassium, zinc, folate, cholesterol, and vitamins A, B 1, B 2, B 6, C and E. RESULTS: The prevalence of H. pylori positivity was lower in the immigrants than in age-matched Korean females (55. 7 % vs 71. 4 %, respectively; P < 0. 0001) and the domestic population of Vietnam. The prevalence of H. pylori positivity among married couples was 31. 7 % for both spouses. There were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of smoking, amount of alcohol consumed, or <b>nutritional</b> <b>factors</b> between the H. pylori-positive and negative groups.

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} <b>nutritional</b> <b>factors,</b> serum lipids, and lipoproteins in late age-related macular degeneration (late AMD). Methods. Intake of red meat, fruit, fish, vegetables, and alcohol, smoking status, and body mass index (BMI) were ascertained questionnaire-based in 1147 late AMD cases and 1773 controls from the European Genetic Database. Serum levels of lipids and lipoproteins were determined. The relationship between <b>nutritional</b> <b>factors</b> and late AMD was assessed using logistic regression. Based on multivariate analysis, area-under-the-curve (AUC) was calculated by receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC). Results. In a multivariate analysis, besides age and smoking, obesity (odds ratio (OR) : 1. 44, P = 0. 014) and red meat intake (daily: OR: 2. 34, P = 8. 22 x 10 (- 6); 2 - 6 x/week: OR: 1. 67, P = 7. 98 x 10 (- 5)) were identified as risk factors for developing late AMD. Fruit intake showed a protective effect (daily: OR: 0. 52, P = 0. 005; 2 - 6 x/week: OR: 0. 58, P = 0. 035). Serum lipid and lipoprotein levels showed no significant association with late AMD. ROC for <b>nutritional</b> <b>factors,</b> smoking, age, and BMI revealed an AUC of 0. 781. Conclusion. Red meat intake and obesity were independently associated with increased risk for late AMD, whereas fruit intake was protective.

50|$|This anaemia {{was then}} known as ‘pernicious anaemia of pregnancy’.

40|$|Feather pecking {{in layers}} is a multi {{factorial}} problem, {{which can be}} caused by environmental, genetic or <b>nutritional</b> <b>factors.</b> From the literature {{it has been shown that}} <b>nutritional</b> <b>factors</b> may positively or negatively affect feather pecking behaviour in laying hens. <b>Nutritional</b> <b>factors</b> seem to reduce feather pecking behaviour in laying hens if these factors increase the time spent on feeding behaviour, by affecting foraging and feed intake. Laying hens may spend more time on these feeding behaviours when they are fed 1) mash diets in stead of crumbles or pellets, 2) low energy diets, 3) high (in-) soluble fibre diets or 4) roughages. However, such feeding strategies may not reduce egg performance of the hens, which can be the case when hens are not able to fully compensate for the dilution. Especially hens at early lay can have problems with consuming sufficient feed for maintenance and egg production.
