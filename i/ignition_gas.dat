40|$|Improvements in {{fuel economy}} {{for a broad}} {{spectrum}} of truck engines and waste heat utilization concepts are evaluated and compared. The engines considered are the diesel, spark <b>ignition,</b> <b>gas</b> turbine, and Stirling. The waste heat utilization concepts include preheating, regeneration, turbocharging, turbocompounding, and Rankine engine compounding.

The results reveal that diesel driving cycle performance can be increased by 20 % through increased turbocharging, turbocompounding, and Rankine engine compounding. The Rankine engine compounding provides about three times as much improvement as turbocompounding but also costs about three times as much.

40|$|Summary This work {{concerns}} {{the identification and}} development of a two-zone spark <b>ignition</b> <b>gas</b> engine model for small scale {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) systems of sufficient detail to enable partload performance characteristics and control system performance to be investigated.

Results from the model are shown to compare favourably with results of similar though less detailed models when a steady-state comparison is made. The work goes on to describe future work concerned with the integration of the engine model within a full CHP system simulation...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 6 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 30 June - 2 July, 2008. The distributed mathematical model (nonstationary 1 D and 2 D) of magnesium particle ignition is developed {{taking into account the}} heterogeneous chemical reaction, the domain of particle thermal influence to gas, and the realistic particle temperature after ignition. Solvability of the corresponding mathematical problem in the stationary one-dimensional case in some kinds of symmetry has allowed one to expand classification of regular modes of heating, and also modes of extinction and ignition of a particle. The numerical method for solving the considered class of boundary value problems of magnesium particles ignition is developed, and the mathematical model is verified by the experimental dependences of: ignition delay time on surrounding gas pressure and particle radius; limiting <b>ignition</b> <b>gas</b> temperature on surrounding gas pressure and particle radius. The limiting size of a gas layer near a particle is found that determines an ignition mode in the frame of this realistic mathematical model.

The poorly ignited charge moved the projectile partially down the tube, increasing the surface area of the propellant. The increased surface area of the propellant then ignited in the tube, raising pressures in parts of the gun not designed for them.

40|$|Abstract. The {{pollutant}} emissions of a four-stroke spark <b>ignition</b> <b>gas</b> engine generator operating on biogas–LPG blends of varying excess air ratios and LPG concentrations were investigated in this paper. Experiments {{were carried out}} at a constant engine speed of 1400 rpm and a constant electric power output of 3. 5 kW. The experimental results showed that NOx emissions were elevated at an excess air ratio of around 1. 2 as the LPG concentration was increased. CO 2 emissions decreased as the excess air ratio and LPG concentration increased, due to lean-burn conditions and LPG combustion. These results demonstrated that the addition of LPG to biogas enabled the effective generation of electricity using a gas engine generator through lean-burn combustion. The adding of LPG of 0 %, 5 %, and 10 % in volume is interchangeable. Mixing inert gas such as N 2 and CO 2 in the end user side to increase the gas MN, thereby increasing its antiknock tendency, furthermore, the measures such as the installation of closed-loop control engine with oxygen sensor in the exhaust and adjust air-fuel ratio accurately and adjusting engine ignition timing, to adapt the changes in gas composition {{to ensure that the}} engine working conditions are not significantly affected, to meet the requirements of natural gas interchangeability...|$|E
40|$|Enabling a {{humanoid}} robot {{to drive a}} car, requires {{the development of a}} set of basic primitive actions. These include: walking to the vehicle, manually controlling its commands (e. g., <b>ignition,</b> <b>gas</b> pedal and steering), and moving with the whole-body, to ingress/egress the car. In this paper, we present a sensor-based reactive framework for realizing {{the central part of the}} complete task, consisting in driving the car along unknown roads. The proposed framework provides three driving strategies by which a human supervisor can teleoperate the car, ask for assistive driving, or give the robot full control of the car. A visual servoing scheme uses features of the road image to provide the reference angle for the steering wheel to drive the car at the center of the road. Simultaneously, a Kalman filter merges optical flow and accelerometer measurements, to estimate the car linear velocity and correspondingly compute the gas pedal command for driving at a desired speed. The steering wheel and gas pedal reference are sent to the robot control to achieve the driving task with the hu-manoid. We present results from a driving experience with a real car and the {{humanoid robot}} HRP- 2 Kai.

40|$|The thermal {{analysis}} {{results of the}} selected group of binders and the thermal reclamation of one spent moulding sand with organic binder, are presented in the paper. The reclaiming process of the quartz matrix {{was performed on the}} basis of the own method of selecting the reclamation temperature. Taking into account thermogravimetric (TG) analysis results of the binder, the temperature range - required for performing the efficient reclamation of spent moulding sand containing this binder - was indicated. In order to confirm the assumptions, the thermal reclamation operations were carried out at a temperature similar to the determined on the TG basis and - for comparisons - at lower and higher temperatures. During the reclamation operation the reclaim samples were taken for the loss on ignition testing, aimed at the determination of the process efficiency. Temperature in the reclaimer chamber and gas consumptions were also recorded. On the bases of the thermal analyses, loss on <b>ignition,</b> <b>gas</b> consumption and temperatures of the reclaimed moulding sand bed the recommendations for the realisation of the thermal reclamation were given. These recommendations will allow a better, than currently available, process control in an aspect of decreasing the pyrolysis effect and limiting the emission of substances harmful for the environment...|$|E

40|$|Unscavenged {{prechamber}} ignition {{has recently}} been developed at LENI-EPFL to reduce the emissions from cogeneration spark <b>ignition</b> <b>gas</b> engines (natural gas and biogas) within the Swiss Motor project supported by the Federal Office of Energy. Prechambers fitted with conventional spark plug allow a 40 % reduction of the CO emissions and a reduction of the NOx emissions below the Swiss limits of the OPair law (Swiss emissions legislation), and a reduction of 55 % of the HC emissions. Unfortunately, spark plugs are weak components in therms of lifetime, reliability and maintenance. There consequently exists a strong motivation to develop new ignition systems which include: pilot injection of fuel, direct injection of fuel with a glow plug or hot gas jets from a prechamber where the comustion is initiated by auto-ignition, controlled mainly by pressure and temperature conditions. In this mode, the prechamber auto-ignition replaces the spark plug and the combustion mode {{is similar to a}} HCCI (Homogeneous charge compression ignition) one. The first step {{in the development of the}} system is the simulation of the auto-ignition in the prechamber in order to understand the phenomena and later to control them. As HCCI combustion is strongly dependent on chemical kinetics and fluid dynamics, a CFD code and a chemical reactions solver have to be numerically linked. First the 3 D fluid flows in the prechamber and in the engine cylinder has been modelled with the well known KIVA 3 -V code. Those results will be taken as reference for further calculations and initial conditions for the chemical reaction calculations. To elaborate and validate an auto-ignition reaction mechanism for natural gas, auto-ignition delays for various gas mixtures have been measured in the rapid compression machine of Lille [1 [. The data identification will be performed using the GRI mechanism as a base for the auto-ignition delays simulation with Chemkin-II. The next step will be the development of an interface between the Chemkin-II solver and a CFD code NSMB (Navier Stokes Multi Block solver [2, 3]). NSMB is an in-house code developed to deal with large meshes on parallel computers and to be coupled with other applications. It has been modified to support dynamic meshes. The coupling is under development...|$|E

By combining radical measurements using a molecular beam mass spectrometer and threshold ionization with GC, GC-MS and temperature profile measurements it was demonstrated that a homogeneous reaction pathway is opened at temperatures above 1100 °C, in parallel to hetero-geneous reactions which start already at 600 °C.
