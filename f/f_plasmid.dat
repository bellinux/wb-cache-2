25|$|In 2014, a {{research}} {{team led by}} Eric Quandt in the lab of Jeffrey Barrick at the University of Texas at Austin described {{the application of a}} new technique called Recursive Genomewide Recombination and Sequencing (REGRES) to identify potentiating mutations among the 70 present in the Ara-3 lineage that evolved Cit+. This method used multiple rounds of a process in which <b>F</b> <b>plasmid</b> based conjugation between a 33,000 generation Cit+ clone, CZB154, and the Cit− founding clone of the LTEE to purge mutations not required for either manifestation of a weak or strong form of the Cit+ trait, which they refer to as Cit++. They found that the rnk-citT module responsible for the phenotypic switch to Cit+ was sufficient to produce a weak Cit+ phenotype in the ancestor. They also identified a mutation that had occurred in the lineage leading to CZB154 after the initial evolution of Cit+ that conferred a strong, Cit++ phenotype in the ancestor absent any mutation but the rnk-citT module. This mutation, found in the regulatory region of a gene called dctA, caused a massive increase in the expression of the DctA transporter, which functions to import C4-dicarboxylates into the cell. This increased DctA expression, they found, permitted Cit+ cells to re-uptake succinate, malate, and fumarate released into the medium by the CitT transporter during import of citrate. They identified a similar mutation in Cit++ clones in the Ara-3 population that increased DctA expression by restoring function to a gene that regulates it, dcuS, that had been deactivated in the ancestral clone. Quandt et al. concluded that the dctA mutation was not involved in potentiation, but refinement. This led them to suggest that evolution of Cit+ in the Ara-3 population might have been contingent upon a genetic background and population-specific ecology that permitted the early, weak Cit+ variants to persist in the population long enough for refining mutations to arise and render growth on citrate strong enough to provide a significant fitness benefit.|$|E

This mechanism is relaxed during stationary phase and nonlethal selections, allowing homosexual redundant plasmid transfer. Homosexual redundant transfer occurs in stationary-phase liquid cultures, within nongrowing populations on solid media, and on media lacking a carbon source. We {{examined the relationship between}} homosexual redundant transfer, which occurs between F+ hosts, and reversion of a plasmid-encoded lac mutant allele, lacI 33 omegalacZ. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and mutations that prevent normal transfer to F- cells reduced redundant transfer and selection-induced reversion of the lacI 33 omegalacZ allele. A recA null mutation reduced redundant transfer and selection-induced reversion of the lacI 33 omegalacZ mutation. Conversely, a recD null mutation increased redundant transfer and selection-induced reversion of the lacI 33 omegalacZ allele. These results suggest an explanation for why SDS and these mutations affect reversion of the plasmid lacI 33 omegalacZ allele. However, a direct causal relationship between transfer and reversion remains to be established. These results suggest that Rec proteins play an active role in redundant transfer and/or that redundant transfer is regulated with the activation of recombination. Redundant homosexual plasmid transfer during a period of stress may represent a genetic response that facilitates evolution of plasmid-encoded functions through mutation, recombination, reassortment, and dissemination of genetic elements present in the populations...|$|R

Data from acridine orange curing experiments places the frequency of double male cells in the population of growing cells in the two-chromosome configuration as less than one percent.

40|$|The {{management}} of infections due to Klebsiella pneumoniae has been {{complicated by the}} emergence of antimicrobial resistance, especially to the carbapenems. Resistance to the carbapenems in K. pneumoniae involves multiple mechanisms, including the production of carbapenemases (e. g. KPC, NDM, VIM, OXA- 48 -like), as well as alterations in outer membrane permeability mediated by the loss of porins, and the up regulation of efflux systems. The latter two mechanisms are often combined with high levels of other types of β-lactamases (e. g. AmpC). K. pneumonaie ST 258 emerged during the early to mid- 2000 s as important human pathogens and has spread extensively throughout the world. ST 258 comprises of 2 distinct lineages namely clade I and clade II and it seems that ST 258 is a hybrid clone that was created by a large recombination event between ST 11 and ST 442.

It encodes a 330 -amino-acid, Mr 36, 786 polypeptide that is processed. Ethanol caused accumulation of a precursor polypeptide; removal of ethanol permitted processing of the protein to occur. Because F lac traU 526 strains appear to be resistant to F-pilus-specific phages, traU has been considered an F-pilus assembly gene. However, electron microscopic analysis indicated that the traU 526 amber mutation caused only a 50 % reduction in F-piliation. Since F lac traU 526 strains also retain considerable transfer proficiency, new traU mutations were constructed by replacing a segment of traU with a kanamycin resistance gene. Introduction of these mutations into a transfer-proficient plasmid caused a drastic reduction in transfer proficiency, but pilus filaments remained visible at approximately 20 % of the wild-type frequency. Like traU 526 strains, such mutants were unable to plaque F-pilus-specific phages but exhibited a slight sensitivity on spot tests.
