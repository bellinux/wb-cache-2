5000|$|Chinampa (chināmitl [...] ) {{is a type}} of Mesoamerican {{agriculture}} {{which used}} small, rectangular areas of fertile arable land to <b>grow</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> the [...] lake beds in the Valley of Mexico.|$|R
50|$|Many hillsides {{that have}} been used to farm will be {{converted}} by the local government to forest areas, as the district finds tourism more profitable than trying to <b>grow</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> mountainsides.|$|R
50|$|The Atayal {{people have}} a {{well-developed}} culture. They originally lived by fishing, hunting, gathering, and <b>growing</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> burned-off mountain fields. Atayal also practice crafts such as weaving, net knotting, and woodworking. They also have traditional musical instruments and dances.|$|R

50|$|The {{name comes}} from the half-acre parcels of land (or tofts) given to owners of {{building}} plots (or burgages) by the River Aire, thus Burgage Men's Tofts. The burgage men pursued craft businesses in the town, and <b>grew</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> their tofts, such as grain which would be processed at the nearby mill on what is now Miles Hill.|$|R
50|$|Although {{production}} of coffee dropped somewhat {{in the late}} 1980s, the 1989 crop was still 42,000 tons. Nicaragua's poor transportation system and ecological concerns over the amount of land devoted to <b>growing</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> volcanic slopes in the Pacific region limit further expansion of coffee cultivation. These limitations have led growers to explore planting other crops in undeveloped areas of the country.|$|R
50|$|Houston's {{farm was}} known as Lakeland Stock Farm. There he bred 250 head of Durham, Jersey and Guernsey cattle. Houston also is {{reported}} to have had 20 horses, 10 mules, and 500 head of sheep. He also <b>grew</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> 150 acre of land including 300 pecan trees, corn, wheat, rye, potatoes, and cotton (according to the Tenth U.S. Census, 1879-1880).|$|R
50|$|Approximately {{two-thirds of}} the Bangladesh people work in agriculture, and <b>grow</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> the fertile {{floodplains}} of the delta. The major crops that are grown in the Ganges Delta are jute, tea, and rice. Fishing {{is also an important}} activity in the delta region, with fish being a major source of food for many {{of the people in the}} area.|$|R
50|$|The farming year starts around February, {{whenever}} the ground dries out enough after the winter rains to allow ploughing to begin. Much of the ploughing is still done with Ox, which {{is by far}} the best option {{for the good of the}} soil. But nowadays to <b>grow</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> large basis and to save time people now use tractor to plough the field.|$|R
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of Exmoor's human occupation from Mesolithic times onwards. In the Neolithic period people started to manage animals and <b>grow</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> farms cleared from the woodland, rather than act purely as hunter gatherers. It is also likely that extraction and smelting of mineral ores to make tools, weapons, containers and ornaments in bronze and then iron started in the late Neolithic and into the Bronze and Iron Ages.|$|R
50|$|In 1861, two {{brothers}} Francis and Henry Mellon (played by Tim Morton and David Maloney) try to <b>grow</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> their inhospitable patch {{of land in}} Kentucky. The brothers play pranks on one another. Francis makes questionable decisions about money and managing the farm. As tensions run high, the two get into a fight that leads Henry to join the Northern side during the American Civil War leaving Francis behind to manage the farm.|$|R
40|$|Upon {{completion}} of the technical and biological reclamation of land from covered mining activities, {{it is necessary to}} perform quality assessment for the soil’s productivity. Thus, it is possible to choose the most appropriate and effective use for them. In the presented paper a quality assessment for the suitability to <b>grow</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> the reclaimed terrain in the village of Lyulin, Pernik municipality is performed, based on updated soil and climatic data. ...|$|R
50|$|Segerstrom High School is {{a public}} high school in Santa Ana, California, and is part of the Santa Ana Unified School District (SAUSD). The school opened in fall of 2005 with a {{freshman}} and sophomore class. Wealthy landowner Henry Segerstrom - for whom Segerstrom High School is named - is a familiar name in Orange County. The land upon which Segerstrom High School is built was purchased from the Segerstrom family, who once <b>grew</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> these acres.|$|R
50|$|Responsibility for the evictees {{was passed}} between the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Health. Most {{of them were}} moved to Air Ministry {{property}} near RAF Heston. The Wilds of Shrub End and Croft House found new farmland near Colchester (near where David Wild's wife had come from), and evacuated their greenhouses and packing shed and front gate and front hedge there. Some of the Heathrow farmers and market gardeners found land in Kent to <b>grow</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on.</b>|$|R
5000|$|By 1900, the {{population}} of Emery County had reached over 4,600 people. Over 450 farms were operating in the county, <b>growing</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> over 25000 acre. Irrigation systems were being expanded to bring new lands into production, bringing with them problems which would plague the region for several decades. Water rights conflicts frequently arose, and water theft, known as [...] "midnight irrigation," [...] became common. Most disputes were settled by decree, but a few were contested by violence.|$|R
5000|$|The people <b>grew</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> the {{floodplains}} {{below their}} towns, planting in areas moistened by overflow from the rivers or near ephemeral streams. Agriculture {{under such conditions}} is risky; the people also depended on gathering wild foods such as mesquite, prickly pears, and agaves. They caught catfish in the rivers. Some of the La Junta Indians journeyed to the Great Plains 150 or more miles northeast to hunt buffalo or trade for buffalo meat with the nomadic Jumano.|$|R
5000|$|The unit, with 336 acre of land, {{was located}} [...]75 mi from the {{intersection}} of Texas State Highway 6 and U.S. Highway 90A. The Central Unit property includes the main prison unit and the Smithville Prison Property (CPU). The prison property is adjacent to the Sugar Land Regional Airport. Prisoners <b>grow</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> land next to the airport's runway. Many of the remaining buildings used an Art Deco architecture style. The unit was in proximity to several neighborhoods.|$|R
50|$|Today, {{a number}} {{of state and federal}} {{initiatives}} serve to reverse habitat loss. Many programs encourage and even reimburse farmers for interrupting the drainage of localized wetholes on their property, often by breaking tile intakes or removing the tile completely. Landowners are often partially or fully compensated for forfeiting the ability to <b>grow</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> this land. Such programs and the cooperation of landowners across the country have had significant positive effects on the populations {{of a wide variety of}} waterfowl.|$|R
5000|$|Up until French rule, the Central Highlands {{was almost}} never entered by the Vietnamese since they {{viewed it as}} a savage (Moi-Montaganrd) {{populated}} area with fierce animals like tigers, [...] "poisoned water" [...] and [...] "evil malevolent spirits", but the Vietnamese became greedy and voracious for the land after the French transformed it into a profitable plantation area to <b>grow</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on,</b> {{in addition to the}} natural resources from the forests, minerals and rich earth and realization of its crucial geographical importance.|$|R
50|$|Agricultural and Land-based Training Association (ALBA) {{and through}} a 4-year USEPA grant, the Coastal Watershed Council (CWC) is {{monitoring}} the impacts of organic farming practices and wetland restoration on water quality in Carneros Creek at ALBA’s Triple M Ranch in North Monterey County. Significant wetlands border Carneros Creek, although these have been greatly reduced by artificial levees in order to <b>grow</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> the many small tenant farms along the creek. Wetland restoration {{has the potential for}} creating habitat for the Santa Cruz Long-toed salamander (Ambystoma macrodactylum croceum) and California red-legged frog (Rana draytonii).|$|R
50|$|Officials of the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad {{pushed for}} the Pittman Underground Water Act, as that company wanted to attract farmers to the Amargosa Valley in Nevada, so that more people would use the railroad. In 1915, the company {{established}} a demonstration farm near Leeland, called the T&T Ranch, to show people the farming possibilities of the area. However, no homesteaders settled, since the Homestead Act included terms that were hard to meet. For example, a surface water supply sufficient to <b>grow</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> 160 acres of land had to be established.|$|R
50|$|Monocropping is the {{agricultural}} practice of <b>growing</b> a single <b>crop</b> {{year after year}} on the same land, {{in the absence of}} rotation through other <b>crops</b> or <b>growing</b> multiple <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> the same land (polyculture). Corn, soybeans, and wheat are three common crops often grown using monocropping techniques.|$|R
25|$|At {{a time in}} the past, {{monocline}} {{formed to}} the west of Sydney. The monocline is a sloping bend that raises the sandstone well above where it is expected to be seen, and this is why the whole of the visible top of the Blue Mountains is made of sandstone. From the beginnings of the colony in 1788, settlers and convicts had to work with the stone, using it for building and trying to <b>grow</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> the soil over it. The sandstone had a negative effect on farming because it underlay most of the available flat land at a very shallow depth.|$|R
50|$|The Finns {{brought with}} them their unique culture and their way of life. Amongst other things, they {{imported}} the agricultural technique, common in Finland and Eastern Sweden, known as svedjebruk or slash-burn agriculture. This involved setting fire to the forest and <b>growing</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> the fertile ash-covered soil. The clearing was initially planted to rye, {{and then in the}} second and third year with turnips or cabbages. It then might be grazed for several years before being allowed to return to woodland. In this manner, they periodically moved around and burned down new areas and left their former areas to regrow with forest.|$|R
50|$|Negative {{externalities}} (external costs) {{lead to an}} over-production {{of those}} goods that have a high social cost. For example, the logging of trees for timber may result in society losing a recreation area, shade, beauty, good quality soil to <b>grow</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on,</b> and air quality but this loss is usually not quantified and included {{in the price of}} the timber that is made from the trees. As a result, individual entities in the marketplace have no incentive to factor in these externalities. More of this activity is performed than would be if its cost had a true accounting.|$|R
50|$|The Angas who {{predominantly}} live on {{the lowlands}} and the Southeastern edge of the Jos Plateau are the largest group in the Jos highlands. The major city is Pankshin. The Gyangyan or Ampang district is dominated by hills and ridges, {{to the west of}} the ridges form the plains that constitute the lands of the Amper district. The soil of the plains of Amper are littered with granite and farmers in the district <b>grow</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> terraced fields to plant cereal crops such as millet, guinea corn and maize. The people used the granite boulders as foundations and walls for their houses.|$|R
50|$|Svedjebruk {{involved}} stripping {{a ring of}} bark completely {{around the}} trunk of coniferous trees like pine or spruce or felling them, allowing them to dry, setting fire to the dried forest and <b>growing</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> the fertile ash-covered soil. The resulting ash was highly fertile, {{but only for a}} short period. The clearing was initially planted to rye as soon as the ash had fully settled and sufficiently cooled. When the rain came, it packed the ash around the rye. The rye germinated & grew prolifically, with anywhere from 25 to 100 stalks (or straws), each with multiple grains.|$|R

5|$|There is {{evidence}} of occupation of the area by people from Mesolithic times onward. In the Neolithic period, people started to manage animals and <b>grow</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> farms cleared from the woodland, rather than act purely as hunters and as gatherers. It is also likely that extraction and smelting of mineral ores to make metal tools, weapons, containers and ornaments started in the late Neolithic, and continued into the bronze and Iron Ages. An earthen ring at Parracombe {{is believed to be}} a Neolithic henge dating from 5000–4000BC, and Cow Castle, which is where White Water meets the River Barle, is an Iron Age fort {{at the top of a}} conical hill.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{abandoned}} terraces on Gavdos where farmers used to <b>grow</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> the hillsides. There still is some agriculture on Gavdos. During the summer, {{the population of}} the island swells to a few thousand because of tourists, although there are few facilities for tourists. There is one year-round cafe in Carave (Karabe) on Gavdos run by Evangelina Tsigonakis. There is a modern non-functioning reproduction lighthouse tower on Gavdos which now serves as a cafe during the summer season; the complex also contains a museum {{on the history of the}} original lighthouse with several rooms of photos and antique equipment. Gavdos has a FM radio station, Gavdosfm 88.8, which is also available online.|$|R
50|$|Switchgrass is an {{approved}} cover crop for land protected {{under the federal}} Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). CRP is a government program that pays producers a fee for not <b>growing</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> land <b>on</b> which <b>crops</b> recently <b>grew.</b> This program reduces soil erosion, enhances water quality, and increases wildlife habitat. CRP land serves as a habitat for upland game, such as pheasants and ducks, {{and a number of}} insects. Switchgrass for biofuel production has been considered for use on Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land, which could increase ecological sustainability and lower the cost of the CRP program. However, CRP rules would have to be modified to allow this economic use of the CRP land.|$|R

50|$|The {{connection}} between the Linares family and cartonería extends back to the 19th century with Juan Bautista Linares from Xochimilco began to make papier-mâché items for festivities related to Holy Week. In the 19th century, Francisco Linares specialized {{in the making of}} Judas figures for burning on Holy Saturday. Celso Linares, the grandfather of Pedro Linares began to make piñatas with papier-mâché instead of using clay pots, as well as masks and human figures. José Dolores Linares, son of Celso and father of Pedro, learned the craft and taught it to his son, along with <b>growing</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> chinampas and making shoes. The family moved from Xochimilco to the Venustiano Carranza area, where Pedro was born.|$|R
5000|$|In 1863, Hutzler staked a {{claim to}} 160 acres of land on the island; {{he was the first}} farmer to stake a claim on the island. [...] He <b>grew</b> <b>crops</b> <b>on</b> his land and {{eventually}} added animals. He constructed this barn some time between 1870 and 1880 to house swine. [...] George Johann Hutzler died in 1890 and was buried on the farm. His son John (born on the island in 1865) took over ownership of the farm; Margaretha stayed there until 1901 when she moved to Chicago. John married Bertha Peth in 1893; the couple had one child in 1899 who died in 1901. John and Bertha soon divorced, but apparently got along amicably when living apart.|$|R
