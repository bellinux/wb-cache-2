The first technology features a 0. 07 µm gate-length in combination with an In content of 80 % in the channel. An extrinsic transit frequency (ft) of 290 GHz, an extrinsic transconductance (gm) of 1500 mS/mm and a gate-drain breakdown voltage of 2. 8 V were measured.

40|$|Threshold {{generation}} in fate-selection circuits is often achieved through deterministic bistability, which requires cooperativity (i. e., nonlinear activation) and associated hysteresis. However, the Tat positive-feedback loop that controls HIV’s fate decision between replication and proviral latency lacks self-cooperativity and deterministic bistability. Absent cooperativity, {{it is unclear}} how HIV can temporarily remain <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>off-state</b> long enough for the kinetically slower epigenetic silencing mechanisms to act—expression fluctuations should rapidly trigger active positive feedback and replication, precluding establishment of latency. Here, using flow cytometry and single-cell imaging, we find that the Tat circuit exhibits a transient activation threshold. This threshold largely disappears after ∼ 40 h—accounting for the lack of deterministic bistability—and promoter activation shortens the lifetime of this transient threshold. Continuous differential equation models do not recapitulate this phenomenon. However, chemical reaction (master equation) models where the transcriptional transactivator and promoter toggle between inactive and active states can recapitulate the phenomenon because they intrinsically create a single-molecule threshold transiently requiring excess molecules in the inactive state to achieve at least one molecule (rather than a continuous fractional value) in the active state. Given the widespread nature of promoter toggling and transcription factor modifications, transient thresholds may be a general feature of inducible promoters...|$|E

40|$|Power {{consumption}} {{is one of}} the most important design factors in modern electronic design. With a large market increase in portable battery-operated devices and push for environmental focus, it is of interest for the industry to decrease the power consumption of modern chips as much as possible. However, as circuits scale down in size the leakage current increases. This increases the static power consumption, and in future technologies the static power is expected to make up most of the overall power consumption. Power gating can decrease static power by isolating a circuit block from the power supply. In large chips, this requires state-retention flip flops and non-volatile memories in order to keep the circuit functioning continuously between power gating sequences. A design concept utilizing this is a Normally Off computer, which is <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>off-state</b> with no static power for the majority of the time. This is achieved by using non-volatile logic and memories. This concept has been realized by using a new semiconductor technology developed at Semiconductor Energy Laboratories Corporation Ltd., which is known as crystalline In-Ga-Zn oxide semiconductor material. This technology realizes transistors with an ultra-low off-state current, and enables several novel designs of state-retention circuits suitable for Normally-Off computers. This thesis presents two different architectures of state retention flip flops utilizing In-Ga-Zn oxide semiconductor transistors, which are produced and compared to determine their tradeoffs and effectiveness. These flip flops are then implemented in a 32 -bit Normally-Off microprocessor to determine the performance of each implementation. This is evaluated by calculating the energy break-even time, which is the power gating time required to overcome the power overhead introduced by the state-retention flip flops. The resulting circuits and the work in this thesis has been presented at two conferences and submitted for publication in one scientific journal...|$|E

As the phenomenon has been demonstrated by thorough observation, the detailed study of the physical properties of the host NLC (the magnitude of dielectric anisotropy, elastic constants, and rotational viscosity), the size of the GP flakes, and cell thickness, are urgently required to be explored and investigated. Here, we demonstrate that the response time of GP flakes reorientation associated with an NLC host can be effectively enhanced by controlling the physical properties. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> vertical field-on state, higher dielectric anisotropy and higher elasticity of NLC give rise to quicker reorientation of the GP flakes (switching from planar to vertical alignment) due to the field-induced coupling effect of interfacial Maxwell-Wagner polarization and NLC reorientation. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> field <b>off-state,</b> lower rotational viscosity of NLC and lower cell thickness can help to reduce the decay time of GP flakes reoriented from vertical to planar alignment.

40|$|Graphene, a zero-gap {{semiconductor}} with massless charge carriers, {{is emerging}} as an amazing material for future electronics, due to its outstanding electrical and mechanical performances. However, the lack of <b>a</b> bandgap results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> high <b>off-state</b> current leakage and a nonsaturating drive current, both of which severely limit graphene's practical applications in electronic devices. Chemical functionalization on its surface promises a powerful tool to manipulate its electronic properties and modify its atomic structures. Graphene is a true two-dimensional material; every carbon atom in single layer graphene is exposed to its environment. Therefore, the surface functionalization in graphene can significantly change its physical and chemical properties, such as bandgap opening and piezoelectricity engineering, etc. Hydrogenation and fluorination have been experimentally demonstrated {{to be effective in}} changing the hybridization state of carbon atoms and opening a bandgap from 2. 9 eV to 5. 4 eV. However, both of these methods are destructive to graphene, and will degrade its carrier mobility. In this study, we fabricated graphene-based field effect transistors (FETs) and conducted surface functionalization via plasma reactions. We systematically investigated graphene chlorination and characterized the results with Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transport measurement. A schematic picture of how the chlorine plasma interacts with graphene was also proposed. Hydrogenation and fluorination were also conducted and analyzed as comparison. We demonstrated that chlorination in graphene via plasma reactions is a very effective and controllable way to engineer its structural and electronic properties. The high mobility of the resulting structures is a very important advantage with respect to other functionalization approaches.
