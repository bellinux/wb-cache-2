40|$|To {{face the}} {{increasing}} demand for animal products throughout the world, livestock-farming systems have been intensified. This intensification {{has proven to be}} economically effective but is noted for its negative impact on the environment through the production of ammonia (NH 3) and the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane. In this context, dynamic models are useful tools to evaluate the effects of farming practice on nutrient flows and losses to the environment. This paper presents the development of a model simulating the flows of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in a rabbit production farm. The model is comprised of two submodels. The first submodel simulates the number of animals in the farm (births, deaths, culling of does/fatteners) and their respective performances (growth, feed intake, milk production). The second one simulates the excretion of N and P for each animal category using a mass-balance approach between intake (feed and/or milk intake) and exports (body deposition, milk production, gestation). Specific emission factors are then applied to the excreted N amounts to estimate total N, NH 3 and N 2 O losses in the housing unit and during manure storage. Methane emissions from <b>enteric</b> <b>fermentations</b> and manure are also estimated. A simulation example based on French technicoeconomic data illustrates how the model could be used to study the dynamics of animal populations within the system and of nutrient flows. Finally, {{there is a need for}} new knowledge (experimental data) to improve the model and help design more sustainable rabbit production systems by identifying best practices that minimise environmental impacts...|$|R
40|$|The carbon {{footprint}} (CF) of milk produced in six Italian Mediterranean Buffalo farms was estimated through a simplified Life Cycle Assessment. Functional unit was 1 kg {{of fat and}} protein corrected milk (FPCM). The farms were characterized by high levels of inputs, as purchased feeds, chemical fertilizers and fossil fuels. Average cultivated area was 53. 2 ha; the forage system was based mainly on maize silage, immediately followed by Italian ryegrass and/or whole cereal silage. Average herd size was 360 and the average FPCM per lactating buffalo was 3563 kg/year with an average milk fat and protein percentage of 8. 24 and 4. 57 respectively. The CF assessment was from cradle to farm gate. The greenhouse gases (GHG) that were taken into account were CH 4 from <b>enteric</b> <b>fermentations,</b> CH 4 from manure in the stable and in the tank; N 2 O from nitrification and denitrification processes in the manure before application into the soil and N 2 O produced after organic and synthetic fertilizer application; direct emissions of CO 2 from the fossil fuels combustion within the farms and indirect emissions of CO 2 deriving from production of electricity, off-farm feeds, synthetic fertilizers and other minor inputs. Carbon footprint of 1 kg of FPCM was 3. 75 kg CO 2 eq. Main sources of GHG are enteric CH 4 (45 %) and indirect CO 2 eq (25 %). Besides enteric CH 4, the farm activity that gives the highest contribution to milk CF is on-farm feed production, with 34 % on total greenhouse gas emissions (TGE). Carbon footprint with economic allocation (CFea) was estimated by considering the live-weight of males calves and culled cows: its value was 3. 60 kg CO 2 eq. If the economic value of the increase of the herd size is considered in the assessment, CFea decreases to 3. 45 or 3. 27 kg CO 2 eq with an increase of 10 % or 20 % {{of the number of}} mature buffalos. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{potential and}} health implications of {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) present in human feces has begun to receive considerable attention. Headspace solid-phase microextraction (SPME) has greatly facilitated the isolation and analysis of VOCs from human feces. Pioneering human fecal VOC metabolomic investigations have utilized a single SPME fiber type for analyte extraction and analysis. However, we hypothesized that the multifarious nature of metabolites present in human feces dictates the use of several diverse SPME fiber coatings for more comprehensive metabolomic coverage. We report here an evaluation of eight different commercially available SPME fibers, in combination with both GC-MS and GC-FID, and identify the 50 / 30 µm CAR-DVB-PDMS, 85 µm CAR-PDMS, 65 µm DVB-PDMS, 7 µm PDMS, and 60 µm PEG SPME fibers as a minimal set of fibers appropriate for human fecal VOC metabolomics, collectively isolating approximately 90 % of the total metabolites obtained when using all eight fibers. We also evaluate the effect of extraction duration on metabolite isolation and illustrate that ex vivo <b>enteric</b> microbial <b>fermentation</b> {{has no effect on}} metabolite composition during prolonged extractions if the SPME is performed as described herein...|$|R
40|$|The study {{aimed to}} find out whether gut {{colonisation}} of premature babies with a probiotic, Lactobacillus GG, modified <b>enteric</b> carbohydrate <b>fermentation.</b> Twenty preterm infants were randomised to receive Lactobacillus GG 10 (8) colony forming units twice a day for two weeks or to a control group. Faecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), ethanol, and urinary 2, 3 -butanediol, were measured in parallel with microbiological studies. Lactobacillus GG colonised nine babies. From 1 - 28 days of age faecal SCFAs did not differ significantly from controls. Median and ranges were (treated and controls, respectively) : acetic acid: 173 (trace- 799), 166 (trace- 700); propionic acid: 44 (trace- 169), 37 (11 - 229); butyric acid: 31 (5 - 107), 37 (2 - 118) mumol/g dry weight. Ethanol was detected in more faecal samples from treated babies (65 % v 37 %), and at higher concentration (6. 3 (trace- 40) v 3. 3 (0. 6 - 8. 8; one 229) mumol/g). 2, 3 -Butanediol was found in 66 % of urine samples from treated babies and 58 % from controls.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the use of fodder shrubs and {{polyunsaturated}} fatty acids as a nutritional strategy to mitigate enteric methane production in cattle. Special emphasis was made on the use of Tithonia diversifolia (Hemsl.) A. Gray (Mexican sun ower), as a species with antimethanogenic potential. Bibliographic information for this review was obtained between July and September 2015 by using key words. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas (GHG), the increase of its atmospheric concentration is caused mainly by emissions from agriculture and industry, but it is also estimated that a proportion of methane is emitted by ruminants as a product of <b>enteric</b> and anaerobic <b>fermentation</b> of diet. This causes an environmental and productive problem in livestock production systems worldwide. Although there is controversy about the real contribution of methane by ruminants and its impact on environmental issues, the amount of emissions should try to be reduced. This document emphasizes the search for nutritional strategies such as supplementation with forage shrubs and sources of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which have shown potential to maintain animal production ef ciency and decrease enteric methane synthesis...|$|R
25|$|Livestock {{production}} {{is by far}} the biggest cause of land use, as it accounts for 30% of the global land surface. It is probably the leading player in biodiversity loss, as it causes deforestation, land degradation, pollution, climate change, overfishing, and invasions by alien species. Livestock is also responsible for at least 20% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, which are the main cause of the current climate change. This is due to feed production, <b>enteric</b> <b>fermentation</b> from ruminants, manure storage and processing, and transportation of animal products. The greenhouse gas emissions from livestock production greatly exceeds the greenhouse gas emissions of any other human activity. Some authors argue that by far the best thing we can do to slow climate change is a global shift towards a vegetarian or vegan diet.|$|E
25|$|Methanogenic archaea are {{responsible}} for all biological sources of methane. Some live in symbiotic relationships with other life forms, including termites, ruminants, and cultivated crops. Other sources of methane, the principal component of natural gas, include landfill gas, biogas, and methane hydrate. When methane-rich gases are produced by the anaerobic decay of non-fossil organic matter (biomass), these {{are referred to as}} biogas (or natural biogas). Sources of biogas include swamps, marshes, and landfills, as well as agricultural waste materials such as sewage sludge and manure by way of anaerobic digesters, in addition to <b>enteric</b> <b>fermentation,</b> particularly in cattle. Landfill gas is created by decomposition of waste in landfill sites. Excluding water vapor, about half of landfill gas is methane and most of the rest is carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen, and variable trace amounts of hydrogen sulfide and siloxanes. If the gas is not removed, the pressure may get so high that it works its way to the surface, causing damage to the landfill structure, unpleasant odor, vegetation die-off, and an explosion hazard. The gas can be vented to the atmosphere, flared or burned to produce electricity or heat. Biogas can also be produced by separating organic materials from waste that otherwise goes to landfills. This method is more efficient than just capturing the landfill gas it produces. Anaerobic lagoons produce biogas from manure, while biogas reactors can be used for manure or plant parts. Like landfill gas, biogas is mostly methane and carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen. However, with the exception of pesticides, there are usually lower levels of contaminants.|$|E

40|$|Waste {{activated}} sludge (WAS) is a by-product {{that has been}} abundantly produced from wastewater treatment plant after secondary biological treatment. The disposal of WAS through landfill or incineration has created more vulnerable problems in term of cost and environmental issues. Many strategies have adapted bioremediation and bioenergy production in order to completely utilize this WAS for sustainable environment and biodiversity conservation. These processes are driven by a complex microorganisms in WAS. Therefore, the successful achievement of both strategies; bioremediation and bioenergy production can be clarified based on the microbial community profile through next-generation sequencing analysis, MiSeq. Bioremediation strategies utilize specific and powerful exogenous microorganisms {{to assist in the}} degradation of various harmful pollutants in WAS. However, this inoculant is unable to retain in WAS {{for a long period of}} time to carry out their specific functions in degradation. The interaction between this inoculant and indigenous microbes presence in WAS is suspected to be one of the main reasons. Therefore, through the microbial community analysis in this study, some indigenous bacteria have been identified as bacterial soldiers that are responsible in killing the inoculant bacteria. The enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) expressing E. coli was used as the inoculant with the fluorescence marker and some antibiotic-resistant genes. The indigenous bacteria identified as bacterial soldiers were mainly from Comamonadaceae, Myxococcales and Sphingobacteriales communities as later proved by co-culture interaction with inoculant. Bioenergy production through methane fermentation is another approach that has been taken to utilize WAS. Many studies have been done in laboratory scale to find an efficient methane production approach including application of antibiotic, azithromycin. The effect of antibiotics on microbial diversity during anaerobic digestion stages is important to understand their mechanisms and functions in methane production. Therefore, in this study, different antibiotics that produced different methane profile were used to clarify the microbial interactions and regulatory systems in each stages of anaerobic digestion process. During anaerobic digestion, hydrolysis and fermentation stages were efficiently occurred due to the activation of hydrolytic and fermentative bacterial communities by all antibiotics used in this study. However, some antibiotics have shaped the unfavorable conditions for methanogens in methanogenesis stages. This unbalanced of microbial communities has affected on methane production. Thus, a balanced of microbial communities in all stages of anaerobic digestion is important for efficient methane production as shown by some antibiotics, including azithromycin. The importance of microbial communities was shown in bioremediation and methane fermentation processes. Another application using by-product taken from refining process of palm oil industry, phospholine gum was done for methane fermentation in WAS. It was found that phospholine gum has inhibited methane production but not affected other anaerobic digestion stages. Therefore, based on these phenomena, phospholine gum has potential to be applied as feed additive for ruminants in mitigating the enteric methane emission which contribute to greenhouse gases. In conclusion, various reflections and dynamics have been shown by microbial diversity due to the different effects and conditions in the biological processes. This has provided a better and clear understanding on their functions and mechanisms in ensuring a successful bioremediation process and bioenergy production as the excellent approaches for sustainable environment and biodiversity conservation. 九州工業大学博士学位論文 学位記番号：生工博甲第 275 号 学位授与年月日：平成 28 年 12 月 27 日 1 Introduction and literature review| 2 General materials and methods| 3 Bacterial soldiers in waste {{activated sludge}} – understanding of the bacterial natural selection for the future successful bioremediation –| 4 Impact of different antibiotics on methane production using waste-activated sludge: mechanisms and microbial community dynamics| 5 Effect of macrolides and lincosamides on methane production using waste activated sludge: mechanisms and microbial community dynamics| 6 Inhibition of a mimic <b>enteric</b> methane <b>fermentation</b> by a palm oil industrial waste, phospholine gum – understanding of microbial community dynamics –| 7 Concluding remarks and suggestions for further research九州工業大学平成 28 年...|$|R
