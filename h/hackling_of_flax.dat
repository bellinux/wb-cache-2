40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} quantifies the {{environmental}} impacts of the production <b>of</b> <b>hackled</b> <b>flax</b> fibres destined for reinforcement of composite materials and compared with those for the production of glass fibres. The ecological advantages <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> fibres production over glass fibres are shown. Most of the environmental indicators used (climate change, acidification, non-renewable energy consumption [...] .) are favourable to flax fibres. However the eutrophication indicator remains high, mainly due to the use and production of fertilizers. Possible optimisation is studied by means of reduction of mechanical extraction steps and chemical products use. A sensitivity analysis highlights that the calculation method used (CML 2000 modified) is robust. The hypothesis of carbon dioxide sequestration influences the climate change indicator. The choice of allocation method, by weight or by economic value, has also a strong influence on {{the environmental impacts}}. Globally, the production <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> fibres appears to be an environmentally attractive alternative to glass fibres...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the Impregnated Fibre Bundle Test (IFBT), {{a common}} method used by carbon and glass fibre {{manufacturers}} {{to determine the}} properties of fibres used in composites, was adapted for natural fibres and validated by a round robin test on one type of natural fibres, namely flax fibres. Five European laboratories have carried out in parallel the IFBT, on the same batch <b>of</b> <b>hackled</b> <b>flax</b> (long fibres), to check the applicability and reliability of this modified method on natural fibres. The results were compared to the more traditional single fibre test (SFT) on elementary fibres. The back-calculated fibre stiffness shows a very low scatter between the five laboratories of less than +/- 5 % (59. 8 ± 2. 4 GPa, as measured between 0 and 0. 1 % strain). The fibre ultimate tensile strength of 527 ± 138 MPa has a higher scatter, compared to stiffness values, as this property is highly sensitive to imperfections and flaws. status: accepte...|$|R

5000|$|Whilst {{the white}} <b>hackle</b> <b>of</b> 2 SCOTS, red <b>hackle</b> <b>of</b> 3 SCOTS and blue <b>hackle</b> <b>of</b> 4 SCOTS have a known ancestry, {{the origin of}} 1 SCOTS black hackle and 5 SCOTS green hackle are not clear and have no {{apparent}} precedent. It {{may be that the}} black <b>hackle</b> <b>of</b> 1 SCOTS simulates the black-cock tail feathers originally worn in the 1904 pattern Kilmarnock Bonnet and latterly in the regimental Glengarry Cap by the Royal Scots and King's Own Scottish Borderers, who merged in August 2006 to form 1 SCOTS. Alternatively, it may be a sympathetic gesture to a former Lowland regiment, the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles), who went into 'suspended animation' in 1968 (and later disbanded), who wore a black hackle in their rifle green dress Balmoral. The adoption <b>of</b> the green <b>hackle</b> now being worn by the Argylls battalion (5 SCOTS) is no doubt a continuation of that regiment's association with the colour green, most prominent in the hue of their regimental kilts and stripes on their regimental association ties. (It is, however, worthy of note that in the 19th Century, all line regiments of the British Army used to designate their [...] "light company" [...] with a green hackle.) The Regimental Band of the Royal Regiment of Scotland does not wear the hackle. However, the Highland Band of the Royal Regiment of Scotland (Territorial Army) continues to wear the red hackle with the Tam o' Shanter. Tradition holds that the black hackle originated as a Scottish tradition of wearing a black feather in your hat to signify you have an ongoing quarrel with someone.|$|R

40|$|The use {{of waste}} biomass for energy {{purposes}} is currently {{of great interest to}} scientific and industrial groups around the world. Flax shive is a waste <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> processing industry, which can be used for energy purposes. The most interesting are the processes of thermal processing, making maximum use of the energy potential of the processed biomass wastes. Such methods of thermal processing include various types of pyrolysis. The paper presents the results of a kinetic study of the pyrolysis process <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> bonfire in the temperature range up to 600 °C using the experimentally obtained data of dynamic thermogravimetry. To find the kinetic parameters and the kinetic model of the process, we used model–independent methods and methods of nonlinear regression. Mathematical processing of the experimentally obtained data made it possible to determine the formal kinetic mechanism of the pyrolysis process <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> shive, the kinetic parameters and the temperature interval of each stage of the process. The obtained kinetic parameters of the pyrolysis process <b>of</b> the <b>flax</b> shive in the future will allow optimizing the industrial pyrolysis technology, to reduce the time spent on carrying out research and construction works. This kinetic model of pyrolysis process contains 4 stages <b>of</b> decomposition <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> shive, corresponding to the processes of moisture loss and thermal destruction <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> shive components — hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin. The significant mass of the carbonaceous residue obtained {{as a result of the}} pyrolysis <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> shive (about 29 % by weight) allows us to conclude that it is potentially possible to use it further for the production of carbon-containing materials. Finally, conclusions about the applicability <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> shive as a raw material for obtaining carbon sorbents will help to make the results of further studies of strength, surface and sorption properties...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This work {{reports on}} a study of thermal {{degradation}} <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> fibres to gain an improved understanding of the use and limitations <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> fibres as reinforcement for thermoplastic composites manufactured by the vacuum forming process. The effect of heating on chemical decomposition and thermal stability was performed, using fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) and thermogravimetry (TG) techniques. In addition, the characterisation of micro structures of failure surface following tensile testing of the composites was conducted. The {{results show that the}} hemicelluloses decomposition <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> fibres during thermal degradation is a factor to have the detrimental effect on the thermal stability of fibres, particularly with low heating rate.

40|$|In this study, flax fabrics {{were applied}} with oxygen and {{nitrogen}} plasma treatment for different execution time. After the plasma treatment, {{the effects of}} gas type and execution time on flax fabrics were investigated in terms of shear strength, hydrophility, color differences, dimensional change and surface properties. According to the results, nitrogen plasma treatment caused to increase the shear strength <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> fabrics more than oxygen plasma treatment. Furthermore, the oxygen and nitrogen plasma treatment caused to increase <b>of</b> hydrophility <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> fabrics and the hydrophility of samples increased with the increment in execution time of plasma treatment. The color differences results indicated that there were not significant differences in color change <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> samples. Besides, scanning electron microscope images demonstrated that the nitrogen plasma treatment provided the optimal surface modification.

40|$|The {{topic of}} {{research}} was {{the evaluation of}} growing technology effect on flax cultivar development (ontogenesis), fibre yield and its quality. The baseline {{of the study were}} pot and field trials carried out during period 2002 - 2007 in two INF Experimental Farms (EF) – EF Pętkowo and EF Sielec Stary. The experiments were performed by the method of randomized blocks arranged simply with 4 replications. The experimental factors were: 4 fibre flax cultivars [Agata (NL), Artemida (PL), Hermes (F), Modran (PL) ], sowing density (2 200 - 2 800 flax seeds m- 2; 110 - 140 kg/ha), techniques <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> seeds sowing (drilling and strie sowing), time <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> harvesting (full flowering- BBCH 65, green maturity <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> straw – BBCH 75, BBCH 79 and green-yellow <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> – BBCH 83). The results of pot and field trials showed that the highest dynamics in plant shoot development and flax fibres formation took place between the 30 th and 57 th day <b>of</b> <b>flax</b> growth, i. e. from BBCH 32 to BBCH 65 stages.
