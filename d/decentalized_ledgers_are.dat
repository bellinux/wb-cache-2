50|$|Simply put, a {{blockchain}} is a {{peer-to-peer network}} that timestamps records by hashing {{them into an}} ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. On the other hand, a distributed <b>ledger</b> <b>is</b> a peer-to-peer network that uses a defined consensus mechanism to prevent modification of an ordered series of time-stamped records. All blockchains <b>are</b> distributed <b>ledgers,</b> but not all distributed <b>ledgers</b> <b>are</b> blockchains.|$|R
30|$|A {{distributed}} <b>ledger</b> <b>is</b> hosted {{and updated}} on a decentralized network of computers that nobody owns. As the authors note, the key innovation {{is a novel}} way to store and update a chain of information (e.g., a series of exchanges, or immutable copies of documents) that anyone can examine and verify without altering. Like cash, tokens in distributed <b>ledgers</b> <b>are</b> anonymous, although governments could easily compel taxpayers to reveal the addresses they own. Yet most cash exists today not as bills or coins but as computer data showing how much people have on deposit. These data are held in private, centralized ledgers controlled by institutions such as banks. Distributed <b>ledgers</b> <b>are</b> public and require no trusted intermediary to verify who has title to what.|$|R

50|$|Historically, the {{purchase}} <b>ledger</b> <b>was</b> maintained in book form, hence the term ledger, but in modern practice {{it is much}} more likely to be held on computer using accountancy software or a spreadsheet. The concept of Double-entry Bookkeeping is that debits balance the credits at all times. For convenience the main Trial Balance lists some accounts containing many entries as simply a single control figure. There is then a separate physical Ledger for the summarised area, which could conveniently be managed on its own, often at physically separate locations from the main ledger book. The Purchase <b>Ledger</b> <b>is</b> a common example of this.|$|R

5000|$|The night audit {{itself is}} an {{audit of the}} guest ledger. The guest ledger (or front office <b>ledger)</b> <b>is</b> the {{collection}} of all accounts receivable for currently registered guests.

The guest <b>ledger</b> <b>is</b> distinct from the city <b>ledger,</b> which <b>is</b> the collection of accounts receivable for non-registered guests (such as credit card companies). The purpose of the night auditor is, but is not limited to, ensuring the accuracy of all financial information, and gathering all needed paperwork to complete the audit. This will include pulling any or all checked-out guests' registration cards, and making sure all guests are checked-out in the system that should be checked-out.|$|R
