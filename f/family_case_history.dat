40|$|Background: Efforts {{to promote}} health or prevent disease may {{conflict}} with patients’ habits at home. Irrespective {{of the national}} setting, families are important social contexts in which illness occurs and resolves. Family members resemble {{each other in their}} illness behaviour, even across generations. To optimize the effect of health promotion strategies the challenge is to unravel family resemblances related to health. The underlying mechanism of family resemblance has not been studied before. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate whether family resemblance is caused by having determinants in common as a result of (i) shared circumstances, (ii) socialization, or (iii) similarity in background characteristics. Methods Data: were used from the second Dutch national survey of general practice. In 2001 all consultations were recorded (electronic medical data) in 104 general practices in The Netherlands. We selected for analysis 41 431 families with children up to 18 years of age and formulated eight hypotheses related to the three abovementioned mechanisms. Data were analysed using multilevel analysis with three levels: individual, family, and practice. Family resemblance in contact frequencies with general practice was set as the dependent variable. Results: In relation to health, mothers still are key figures, but the fathers’ role is also important. All in all, we were able to show that having determinants of frequencies of contact in common through socialization and shared circumstances can explain similarities in contact frequencies within families, although not all hypotheses could be confirmed. Regarding shared circumstances family resemblance was best explained by conjoint contacts of mothers with children. Related to socialization resemblance was best explained by spending more time together. Conclusions: The concepts of shared circumstances, socialization and homogeneous background characteristics can serve as a framework for a <b>family</b> <b>case</b> <b>history.</b> A <b>family</b> <b>case</b> <b>history</b> may shed a different light on strategies for health promotion. In countries with free access to specialists, general practitioners may have fewer opportunities to gain insight into family patterns which may lead to less effective treatment strategies.

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis named "Free time of youngsters, {{located in}} an educational institution" deals with high-risk behaviour of young children and teenagers. The theoretical part includes basic terminology of free time, primary and secondary socialization, and the general view {{of the way of}} upbringing. In the same time, it provides the legislative introduction to the way how the system of the institutional and protective education in educational institutions is divided and preventive educational care in educational institutions. The practical part of the bachelor thesis presents a qualitative research, in which we attempt to reveal the connection between the free time and high-risk behaviour of educational institution's clients. It focuses mainly on the way of spending free time of female respondents before the time of their placing to the educational institution, done by the analysis of their family background through the personal and <b>family</b> <b>case</b> <b>history...</b>|$|E
40|$|Why do contact {{frequencies}} {{with general}} practice {{of family members}} resemble each other? Many aspects related to the clustering of health-care utilisation within families have been studied, but the underlying mechanisms have not been addressed. This article considers whether family similarity in contact frequency with general practice can be explained as (a) a result of shared circumstances, (b) through socialisation, and (c) through homogeneity of background characteristics. Data from the second Dutch national survey of general practice were used to test these mechanisms empirically. This survey recorded all consultations in 2001 for 104 general practices in the Netherlands, serving 385 461 patients. Information about socio-demographic characteristics was collected {{by means of a}} patient survey. In a random sample, an extended health interview took place (n ¼ 12 699). Overall, we were able to show that having determinants in common through socialisation and shared circumstances can explain similarity in contact frequencies within families, but not all hypotheses could be confirmed. In specific terms, this study shows that resemblances in contact frequencies within families can be best explained by spending more time together (socialisation) and parents and children consulting a general practitioner simultaneously (circumstances of the moment). For general practitioners, the mechanisms identified can serve as a framework for a <b>family</b> <b>case</b> <b>history.</b> The importance of the mechanism of socialisation in explaining similarities in help-seeking behaviour between family members points to the significance of knowledge and health beliefs underlying consultation behaviour. An integrated framework including these aspects can help to better explain health behaviour. ...|$|E

40|$|Many Cambodian American {{families}} have struggled {{on the economic}} margins since their arrival to the U. S. in the 1980 s. To raise families in poverty Cambodians created family survival strategies to buffer themselves against economic uncertainty and {{the vagaries of the}} social welfare system. They combine public assistance with formal and informal work activities of household members, including teenagers and young adults, to survive. With the passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 or Welfare Reform, Cambodians lost vital economic resources. Based upon a longitudinal qualitative study from 1998 - 2007, this article looks back on how first generation Cambodian American household members adjusted to changes in welfare policy practices and how the loss of vital resources impacted the youth (15 - 19 years old) coming of age in these families.

40|$|Asthma {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} chronic diseases in childhood worldwide. In Germany about 10 percent of all children suffer from asthma. In international studies the reasons for this respiratory disease are assumed and investigated in many different fields, such as genetic predisposition, exposition to allergens and endotoxins or social status and further factors. It is the aim of this paper to discuss if weight at an early age – measured against the BMI – may have an influence on the development of a respiratory disease and asthma bronchiale. In order to clarity this issue an essay on the possible effects of indoor factors on children´s trouble in breathing was consulted. The investigation was carried out on 801 children in the District of Heinsberg (Germany), Middel Limburg (the Netherlands) and Westlijke Mijnstreek (the Netherlands) in 1997; 333 children of them had troubles in breathing, 468 children did not have any symptoms. Beside the factor overweight, the influence of other factors such as gender, premature birth, birth weight, smoking during pregnancy, breastfeeding, social origin and status, passive exposition to smoke and the <b>family</b> <b>case</b> <b>history</b> were considered in the calculations. Risk factors for the development of a respiratory disease and particularly asthma are: male sex, smoking throughout pregnancy as well as passive exposition to smoke, having a low or middle social status as well as a positive asthma case history of the mother or siblings. Weight is also a proven risk factor: with growing BMI the risk of respiratory trouble also grows. Within this context Cole´s cutpoints did not turn out to be significant, especially not for the prevalence of respiratory diseases such as asthma. On the other hand, factors such as origin, birth weight, premature birth, breastfeeding as well as the father´s positive asthma case history do not have any influence on the development of asthma. The relevant literature on this subject on the one hand comes to clearly different results, but on the other also partly conform to our results. Yet, there are still not identical in all aspects. It turned out that further efforts will have to be made in order to find out whether only one single factor or the interaction of most different factors can be made responsible for the development of asthma...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the previously under-explored {{area of the}} intersection of individuals’ cultural and gender identity in relation to food {{within the framework of}} New Zealand food culture. The analysis focuses upon how the cross-generational transmission of food culture has occurred within Pakeha families in New Zealand, and how the process has affected gendered identities. The study was based on analyses of in-depth interviews and reminiscences provided by 15 individual respondents from six families about their food preferences and practices. This interview data was summarised and organised into six <b>family</b> <b>case</b> <b>histories.</b> Also in analysing New Zealand cookbooks, the thesis considers social changes related to the changing meaning of food and cooking in association with individuals’ gender roles. Particular attention was paid to the ‘de-gendering’ of cooking. If men are cooking more nowadays than in the past, do they invest this activity with different social meanings from women? If women spend less time on food preparation than in the past, do they depend more on convenience foods?

40|$|Despite a {{proliferation}} of research exploring children´s lives and relationships {{over the past two}} decades, there is a notable absence of research which explores family relationships from the perspective of very young children (age 0 - 3). This paper will report on data emerging from a study of new mothering with a particular focus on very young children´s active engagement with wider family narratives, and the means with which to explore these processes. The UK based Making of Modern Motherhoods project has composed 12 longitudinal <b>family</b> <b>case</b> <b>histories</b> from the period 2005 - 2007 starting from the first time mother and including grandmothers and significant others, subsequently following seven families over a further two years (2008 - 2009).

This approach has enabled us to capture {{for the first time the}} emergence of the child (around 2 years old). This paper will draw on data across the case studies, focusing on examples of interaction between researcher, mother and child relating to food. We explore how researcher subjectivity can be interrogated as rich source of evidence regarding the place of the child within the research and family dynamic. We observe the way in which researcher attention moves between direct and indirect engagement with the child, and between adult and child centred activities, giving rise to reactions ("acting up") from both mothers and children. Our data reveals significant differences between family practices, with children performing identities and roles for and with the researcher that are intimately bound up with wider family narratives...|$|R
