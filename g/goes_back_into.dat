5|$|Later, Jan starts {{playing one}} of Frankie's CDs, but Graham {{turns it off}} to talk about money with Si and Sally. Jan takes Tamsin outside. Tamsin worries that Frankie's death is her fault because {{she asked him to}} blow up the balloon. She asks if Frankie's soul will go to Heaven, and Jan says that it will. Inside, Si, Sally and Graham argue about how to split the money they will make from the balloon. The {{argument}} gets heated after Sally argues that the fact Tamsin will soon die should preclude her from getting a share. As Graham threatens to pop the balloon, Jan reappears and chastises him. Tamsin, who is now considered neutral, takes the balloon. Graham says they should all settle down and have lunch. In the kitchen, Sally and Jan talk about Sally's work, and, in Tamsin's bedroom, Graham and Si talk about Parsons, with Si revealing that Parsons was actually unpleasant to work for. There is a loud bang from outside, and everyone <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the lounge, erroneously thinking that the balloon has burst. Graham and Si take the balloon to an upstairs bedroom and tuck it into a bed, while Jan turns the music back on.|$|E

Michael donates blood at a mobile blood drive being held in the business park's parking lot and has a nice conversation with a female donor (Kathryn Aselton) sitting next to him. When they both finish at the same time, Michael passes out because he did not eat much before giving blood, and when he wakes up she is gone. A disappointed Michael finds a glove he assumes she left behind and takes it, hoping she will come back for it.

25|$|The APG-70 {{radar system}} allows air crews to detect ground targets from longer ranges.

500|$|The {{roller coaster}} {{begins in the}} station, which is built {{to look like a}} {{partially}} destroyed church, and climbs up a [...] chain lift hill. Upon reaching the top of the lift hill, the track twists 180 degrees anticlockwise, so that riders are upside down, before plunging down the world's first dive drop element. The train then proceeds to dive under the wing of a wrecked plane and into a zero-g roll [...] above the ground before passing through a billboard, immediately following which the on-ride photo is taken. It then enters an inclined loop [...] in height. It then enters a turnaround with a wrecked helicopter with slow-spinning rotor blades in the centre. This is followed by a corkscrew, which passes through the inclined loop. Upon leaving the corkscrew, the train curves past a crashed fire engine with water and fire effects and proceeds through a keyhole: a partly destroyed church tower. The ride then flies over the station and enters into a last inline twist before a mid-course brake run. Following this, the train makes a banked left-hand turn into the final brakes. The train then <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the station. The ride previously featured an on-ride video camera, filming riders and allowing the purchase of a DVD afterwards; this was removed sometime in 2016.|$|E

After Veronica <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> her house, Keith announces {{that he has}} begun dating Wallace's (Percy Daggs III) mother, Alicia, making things awkward between Veronica and Wallace. Veronica notices a sign outside which says [...] "KillemAll.net". In class, there is a fire drill, and Duncan (Teddy Dunn) {{says that it is}} the third one this week. Veronica talks to Principal Clemmons about the fire drill issue, but he doesn't give {{anything}} up to her. Later, she notices police officers with service dogs going through the building. Veronica, posing as the superintendent, calls Principal Clemmons, who reveals that the school has experienced several bomb threats. She prints the story in the school newspaper, causing chaos at school the next day. Principal Clemmons calls her in again and tells her to stop printing stories. Veronica and Wallace talk to each other while Keith and Alicia watch a movie. Alicia tries to convince Wallace to accept their relationship to no avail. After talking to Mac (Tina Majorino), another student, Pete (Michael McMillian) approaches Veronica to say that he saw two students, Ben (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) and Norris (Theo Rossi) with exploding tennis balls. Wallace places the two students under more suspicion when he tells Veronica about them, and Veronica sees a mysterious timer.|$|E
500|$|The film {{also makes}} {{substantial}} use of chaos theory, string theory, and the butterfly effect {{to accentuate the}} lack of control that humanity as individuals possesses. Often at each stage of his life there is a scene where Nemo {{is subject to the}} whims of chance, often plunging into water, a place where humans lack all control. This is a visual symbol of the powerlessness attributed to the human condition. The theories are used to compound reality in the film, it is why the smoke never <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the cigarette, time is always moving in one direction. [...] At the end when it assumes that the universe is on the precipice of ultimate chaos, making use of the Big Crunch theory, time halts, and it begins to reverse. Thus signalling the absolute freedom Nemo had been seeking â€“ being able to live a life without choice, for while you never choose all things remain possible. The tale of Nemo Nobody reflects a life of choices, whether or not we made the correct choice and what would happen if we could go back and change them. In the reveal Mr. Nobody age 118 states that it doesn't matter what we choose, because each choice, once made has just as much significance as any alternate choice. The film portrays a life where we are all subject to chance, to the dimensions by which we construct our reality (height, length, width and time), and to the imagination of our former selves. And once the boy Nemo knows the outcomes of either choice, he instinctively opts for another.|$|E

2500|$|According to Rajneesh, one has {{no right}} to knowingly inflict a {{lifetime}} of suffering: life should begin only at birth, and even then, [...] "If a child is born deaf, dumb, and we cannot do anything, and the parents are willing, the child should be put to eternal sleep" [...] rather than [...] "take the risk of burdening the earth with a crippled, blind child." [...] He argued that this simply freed the soul to inhabit a healthy body instead: [...] "Only the body <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> its basic elements; the soul will fly into another womb. Nothing is destroyed. If you really love the child, you will not want him to live a seventy-year-long life in misery, suffering, sickness, old age. So even if a child is born, if he is not medically capable of enjoying life fully with all the senses, healthy, then it is better that he goes to eternal sleep and is born somewhere else with a better body." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{study of}} botany <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> pre-history as plants were {{the food of}} people from the {{beginning}} of the human race. The first attempts at plant cultivation are believed to have been made shortly before 10,000 BC in Western Asia (Morton, 1981) and the first references to algae are to be found in early Chinese literature. Records as far back as 3000 BC indicate that algae were used by the emperor of China as food (Huisman, 2000 p.13). The use of Porphyra in China dates back to at least A.D. 533â€“44 (Mumfard and Miura, 1988), there are also references in Roman and Greek literature. The Greek word for algae was [...] "Phycos" [...] whilst in Roman times the name became Fucus. There are early references to the use of algae for manure. The first coralline algae to be recognized as living organisms were probably Corallina, by Pliny the Elder in the 1st century AD (Irvine and Chamberlain, 1994 p.11).|$|E
2500|$|Most of {{the forms}} that were {{decorated}} with figures in low relief were thrown in pottery moulds, the inner surfaces {{of which had been}} decorated using fired-clay stamps or punches (usually referred to as poinÃ§ons) and some free-hand work using a stylus. [...] The mould was therefore decorated on its interior surface with a full decorative design of impressed, intaglio (hollowed) motifs that would appear in low relief on any bowl formed in it. [...] As the bowl dried, the shrinkage was sufficient for it to be withdrawn from the mould, in order to carry out any finishing work, which might include the addition of foot-rings, the shaping and finishing of rims, and in all cases the application of the slip. [...] Barbotine and appliquÃ© ('sprigged') techniques were sometimes used to decorate vessels of closed forms. [...] Study of the characteristic decorative motifs, combined in some cases with name-stamps of workshops incorporated into the decoration, and also sometimes with the cursive signatures of mouldmakers, makes it possible to build up a very detailed knowledge of the industry. [...] Careful observation of form and fabric is therefore usually enough for an archaeologist experienced in the study of sigillata to date and identify a broken sherd: [...] a potter's stamp or moulded decoration provides even more precise evidence. The classic guide by Oswald and Pryce, published in 1920 [...] set out many of the principles, but the literature on the subject <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the 19th century, and is now extremely voluminous, including many monographs on specific regions, as well as excavation reports on important sites that have produced significant assemblages of sigillata wares, and articles in learned journals, some of which are dedicated to Roman pottery studies.|$|E
