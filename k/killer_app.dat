[...] The action-adventure title involved the quest of protagonist Ryo Hazuki to avenge his father's murder, but its main selling point was its rendition of the Japanese city of Yokosuka, which included a level of detail considered unprecedented for a video game. Incorporating a simulated day/night cycle with variable weather, non-player characters with regular schedules, and the ability to pick up and examine detailed objects (also introducing the Quick-time event in its modern form), Shenmue went over budget and was rumored to have cost Sega over $50 million.

40|$|Map {{matching}} is {{a fundamental}} operation in many applications such as traffic analysis and location-aware services, the <b>killer</b> <b>apps</b> for ubiquitous computing. In past, several map matching approaches have been proposed. Roughly, they can be categorized into four groups: geometric, topological, probabilistic, and other advanced techniques. Surprisingly, kernel methods have not received attention yet although they are very popular in the machine learning community due to their solid mathematical foundation, tendency toward easy geometric interpretation, and strong empirical performance {{in a wide variety}} of domains. In this paper, we show how to employ kernels for map matching. Specifically, ignoring map constraints, we first maximize the consistency between the similarity measures captured by the kernel matrices of the trajectory and relevant part of the street map. The resulting relaxed assignment is then "rounded" into a hard assignment fulfilling the map constraints. On synthetic and real-world trajectories, we show that kernels methods can be used for map matching and perform well compared to probabilistic methods such as HMMs...|$|R

40|$|Secure {{computation}} has {{the potential}} to completely reshape the cybersecruity landscape, but this will happen only if we can make it practical. Despite significant improvements recently, secure computation is still orders of magnitude slower than computation in the clear. Even with the latest technology, running the <b>killer</b> <b>apps,</b> which are often data intensive, in secure computation is still a mission impossible. In this paper, I present two approaches that could lead to practical data intensive secure computation. The first approach is by designing data structures. Traditionally, data structures have been widely used in computer science to improve performance of computation. However, in secure computation they have been largely overlooked in the past. I will show that data structures could be effective performance boosters in secure computation. Another approach is by using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). A common belief is that FHE is too inefficient to have any practical applications for the time being. Contrary to this common belief, I will show that in some cases FHE can actually lead to very efficient secure computation protocols. This is due to the high degree of internal parallelism in recent FHE schemes. The two approaches are explained with Private Set Intersection (PSI) as an example. I will also show the performance figures measured from prototype implementations...|$|R

40|$|Beginning 1995, a {{regional}} ATM network extending over a 65 km diameterand more than 150 km {{fiber optic cable}} was built and operated by a groupfrom the scientific community {{of the state of}} Bremen. Also, one completeLAN serving 500 users and some parts of LANs were rebuilt using ATMLAN-E as the base technology. This platform also served specificprojects with ATM connectivity to locations in Europe and even Canada. The 155 MBit/s network connects about 30 "participants" ranging from a single workstation with an ATM-NIC in a small firm to complete IP networks including a university campus. As opposed to other networks, ATM signalling was used extensively from the beginning. External connectivity is by access to the (IP-) science network "B-WiN" and ATM network of Deutsche Telekom at 34 MBit/s each. Thus, the network serves as a backbone for utility Internet access formost of the regional science and educational institutions as well as aplatform for specific R&D projects such as the G 7 project SPOCK whichdeals with distributed engineering in the aerospace industry, and theACTS project EIES which is to set up a trial communications servicebetween European harbours. Some observations - as of autumn 1997 - are:- Building an ATM LAN-E based local area network with routers, ATM- andEthernet-switches from a single vendor is -almost- a plug-and-playoperation today, given some experience in IP-network operation. - Under these constraints and given a little experience in ATM, LAN-Eeven proves useful in extending an emulated LAN to another city, on thefly. - It is somewhat harder to integrate workstations and ATM-NICs ofdifferent flavours into these emulated LANs as clients. - Integration of ATM equipment of a different vendor into the networkremains to be a major undertaking. - No native ATM "killer"-application has emerged on the desktop. Contrary to the beliefs of some in 1995, LAN-E seems to be simple enoughto be stable, useful and performing in real world user- and operationalenvironments. Maybe LAN-E and its successors are the <b>killer</b> <b>apps</b> of ATM- if interoperability problems are solved...|$|R
