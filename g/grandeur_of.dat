5|$|Another {{canceled}} {{proposal to}} orbit Ganymede was the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter. It {{was designed to}} use nuclear fission for power, ion engine propulsion, and would have studied Ganymede in greater detail than previously. However, the mission was canceled in 2005 because of budget cuts. Another old proposal was called The <b>Grandeur</b> <b>of</b> Ganymede.|$|E
5|$|Narihira {{was not a}} {{profound}} poet. His surviving poems are mainly occasional, and even when the expression suggests deeply felt emotion, its worldly manner keeps his poetry from attaining the <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> the best Man'yōshū poems in the same vein. He is nevertheless of historical importance as one who maintained {{the traditions of the}} waka during the long night of the dominance of poetry in Chinese.|$|E

5|$|For the exterior, Burges re-used some of {{his earlier}} unexecuted plans, the overall design from the Crimea Memorial Church and St John's Cathedral, Brisbane, the {{elevations}} from Lille Cathedral. The main problem of the building was its size. Despite the prodigious efforts of its fundraisers, and despite Burges exceeding the original budget, Cork was still unable to afford a really large cathedral. Burges overcame this obstacle by using the <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> his three-spired exterior to offset the lesser scale of {{the remainder of the}} building.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Jarre {{was invited}} by the musical {{director}} of the Houston Grand Opera to perform a concert celebrating Texas's 150th anniversary on 5 April 1986. Although he was busy with other projects and was at first unimpressed by the proposal, on a later visit to the city, he was immediately impressed by the visual <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> the city's skyline and agreed to perform. Also, 1985 marked the 25th anniversary of {{the foundation of the}} Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center; and NASA asked Jarre to integrate the anniversary into the concert.|$|E
5|$|The Abercromby baronets owned a {{significant}} amount of property in Ireland, as most of the town of Fermoy had been purchased by them from John Anderson in the early 19th century. By 1814 Forglen was used as the main family seat of the Abercromby family; in 1877 they also acquired Dunlugas House, which was sited {{on the other side of}} the River Deveron. Lady Jane Abercromby's son, Sir Robert Abercromby, 5th Baronet, continued to enhance the <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> the estate policies by commissioning the building of a new mansion and several other buildings.|$|E

5|$|The {{existing}} {{design of}} the Piazza del Campidoglio and the surrounding palazzi was created by Renaissance artist and architect Michelangelo Buonarroti in 1536–1546. At {{the height of his}} fame, he was commissioned by the Farnese Pope Paul III, who wanted a symbol of the new Rome to impress Charles V, who was expected in 1538. This offered him the opportunity to build a monumental civic plaza for a major city as well as to reestablish the <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> Rome.|$|E
5|$|Although {{most of the}} {{writings}} that have survived from this period are religious in nature, there is sufficient literary evidence that secular writing was also popular in the imperial court. Some of these writings carry useful information on urban life, <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> the imperial and provincial courts, royal weddings and ceremonies. Other works refer the general town planning, fortifications and ordnance details at Vijayanagara and other important cities, irrigation reservoirs, merchants and shops dealing {{in a variety of}} commodities. On occasion, authors dwell on mythical cities that reflect their idealised views on contemporary life. Commonly found in these works are description of artists and professionals and their relationship with the court. These included poets, bards, composers, painters, sculptors, dancers, theatrical performers and even wrestlers. Others who find mention are political leaders, ambassadors, concubines, accountants, goldsmiths, moneylenders and even servants and door keepers.|$|E
5|$|Building {{began in}} 1909, using oak from the estate, {{metalwork}} from local blacksmiths, and stone quarried locally, {{brought to the}} site by a private railway line. Barnsley insisted that no machines would be used, so instead of using a saw powered by steam engine, the wood was hand-sawn in a saw pit. The east wing was completed by 1915, and the Biddulphs moved into them, with the reception rooms finished around the same time. Despite the <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> the building, the Biddulph's lived in some small rooms and fitted the large reception rooms for community use. Biddulph also built some cottages {{at the site of}} the old manor house at Rodmarton around the same time.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to his official cult, Unas was deified and became a local god of the Saqqara necropolis. Grimal attributes this directly to the <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> his funerary complex. Malek doubts {{the existence of a}} popular cult of Unas during the Old Kingdom but acknowledges it from the Middle Kingdom onwards. He attributes this Middle Kingdom revival to the geographic position of Unas' complex making it a natural gateway to the Saqqara necropolis. The popular cult of the deified Unas continued for nearly 2,000 years as shown by the numerous scarabs bearing Unas' name found in Saqqara and dated from the New Kingdom (c.1550c.1077 BC) until the Late Period (664332 BC). The epicenter of this cult was not the pyramid of Unas nor the associated mortuary temple but rather the statues of the king in the valley temple.|$|E
5|$|Three cruise ships, Carnival Pride, Carnival Destiny, and <b>Grandeur</b> <b>of</b> the Seas had {{to alter}} their courses due to the {{presence}} of Bonnie. Due to the threat of a tropical storm, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal {{declared a state of emergency}} on July22. Along the Gulf Coast, concerns arose regarding the potential effects of the storm on the BP oil spill earlier in the year. Due to risk of intoxicated storm surge, authorities prepared for possible evacuations of low-lying areas along coastlines. On July23, Admiral Thad Allen ordered the oil spill site to be evacuated, as Bonnie posed a safety threat to nearly 2,000 people in that area. The ships and vessels in the area began preparation for evacuation on July24. Closer to shore, approximately 1,300 fishing boats laying boom had to evacuate.|$|E
5|$|For many scholars, {{the scene}} at 6.34 seems to {{anticipate}} and parallel the confrontation between Theodosius and Ambrose in 390; Erasmus used the two situations as parallel exempla in a letter written to Francis I in 1523. That later event has been taken as evidence against Philip's Christianity. Even in the later 4th century, {{in a society that}} had already been significantly Christianized, the argument goes, Theodosius' humiliation had shocked the sensibilities of the aristocratic elite. It is therefore inconceivable that 3rd century aristocrats, members of a society that had experienced only partial Christianization, would accept such self-abasement from their emperors. Shahîd contests this parallel, and argues that Philip's scene was far less humiliating than Theodosius': it did not take place against the same background (Theodosius had massacred seven thousand Thessalonicans some months before), no one was excommunicated (Theodosius was excommunicated for eight months), and it did not involve the same dramatic and humiliating dialogue between emperor and bishop. Philip made a quick repentance at a small church {{on his way back to}} Rome from the Persian front, a stark contrast to the <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> Theodosius' confrontation with Ambrose.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, others bemoaned the austere Roman culture during his papacy; Giorgio Vasari in 1567 {{spoke of a}} time when [...] "the <b>grandeurs</b> <b>of</b> this place reduced by stinginess of living, {{dullness}} of dress, and simplicity in so many things; Rome is fallen into much misery, and {{if it is true that}} Christ loved poverty and the City wishes to follow in his steps she will quickly become beggarly...".|$|R

Loudon Wainwright, Jr. {{is the father of}} Loudon Wainwright III and grandfather of Rufus Wainwright. Wainwright wrote the column for 24 years until his death in 1988 at the age of 63. The column has been described as [...] "always a pleasing paradox, a self-revealing and even confessional voice, thoughtful, concerned and unpretentious, amid the collective <b>grandeurs</b> <b>of</b> photo-journalism." ...|$|R
5|$|No {{significant}} portion of Leitch's original stadium remains today following a series of bold redevelopments during the 1930s. The idea {{was to create a}} ground for London that could capture the <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> Villa Park, home of Birmingham club Aston Villa. The Highbury project was ambitious in its scale and reach, the first stand completed being the West Stand, designed by Claude Waterlow Ferrier and William Binnie in the Art Deco style which opened in 1932. On 5 November the same year the local Tube station was renamed from Gillespie Road to Arsenal. Leitch's main stand was demolished {{to make way for a}} new East Stand, matching the West, in 1936. The West Stand cost £45,000 while the East Stand went far over budget and ended up costing £130,000, mainly thanks to the expense of the facade. The North Bank terrace was given a roof and the southern terrace had a clock fitted to its front, giving it the name the Clock End.|$|E
5|$|Schubert's last sonatas mark a {{distinct}} change of compositional style from his earlier piano sonatas, with several important differences. The typical movement length has increased, {{due to the}} use of long, lyrical, fully rounded-off, ternary-form themes, the insertion of development-like passages within expositions, and the lengthening of the development section proper. Texturally, the orchestral <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> the middle-period sonatas gives way to a more intimate writing that resembles a string ensemble. New textures appear in the last sonatas – scale-like melodic elements, free counterpoint, free fantasia, and simple accompanimental patterns such as Alberti bass, repeated chords, and ostinati; the orchestral unison texture, abundant in the preceding sonatas, has disappeared. The harmonic language has also changed: more distant key relationships are explored, longer modulatory excursions, more major/minor shifts of mode, and more chromatic and diverse harmonic progressions and modulations, using elements such as the diminished seventh chord. In general, the last sonatas seem to enact a return to an earlier, more individual and intimate Schubertian style, here combined with the compositional craftsmanship of Schubert's later works.|$|E
5|$|Walker {{sought to}} erect a new {{building}} to address the increasingly cramped conditions of the original Boylston Street campus located near Copley Square, in the increasingly fashionable and crowded Back Bay neighborhood of Boston. Because the stipulations of the original land grant prevented MIT from covering more than two-ninths of its current lot, Walker announced his intention to build the industrial expansion on a lot directly across from the Trinity Church fully intending that expected opposition would lead to favorable terms for selling the proposed land and funding construction elsewhere. With the financial health of the Institute only beginning to recover, Walker began construction on the partially-funded expansion, fully expecting the immediacy of the project to be a persuasive tool for raising its funds. The strategy was only partially successful, as the 1883 building had laboratory facilities that were second-to-none but also lacked the outward architectural <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> its sister building and was generally considered an eyesore on its surroundings. Mechanical shops were {{moved out of the}} original Rogers Building in the mid-1880s to accommodate other programs, and in 1892 the Institute began construction on another Copley Square building.|$|E

5|$|A {{sequel to}} Kameo was in {{production}} but was ultimately canceled. George Andreas {{began work on}} the sequel after finishing the first game. Kameo 2 {{was designed to be}} a darker take on the original. Rare redesigned Kameo to have smaller eyes and matured the other creatures. For instance, the trolls were given steampunk designs. The sequel put a heavier emphasis on the open world, as the team was influenced by Assassin's Creed (2007). Rare began to use Havok physics software for smoother inverse kinematics animations, and planned to incorporate assets from an unreleased game, Black Widow, which featured a giant, mechanical spider. For creature upgrades, the team planned to let Kameo fly as an eagle so the player could experience the <b>grandeur</b> <b>of</b> a bird's-eye view. Kameo composer Steve Burke said that he worked on the sequel for a year. He wrote several new audio tracks in a Celtic style and recorded voiceovers, which together were used in a concept demo pitched to Microsoft. The project was canceled after about three months of production as Rare re-focused on Microsoft's Kinect effort. At the time, Microsoft redirected its internal studios to support the project. The original's lackluster sales also contributed to the cancelation. The public had heard reports of its cancelation during the 2009 restructure and had seen an artwork leak in 2011, but the cancelation was not confirmed until Microsoft Studios vice president Phil Spencer did so in 2013. 1UP.com questioned whether Kameo needed a sequel at all. Rare released a retrospective documentary of the unreleased game as part of its August 2015 Rare Replay collection. A Kameo 2 concept artist narrated the documentary, which focuses on art that would have been included in the game apart from a brief video clip. Rare later released a follow-up making-of Kameo video in March 2016. The sequel's video did not elaborate on why Microsoft canceled the project.|$|E
