5|$|Although {{there is}} no clear {{evidence}} that the flower's name derives directly from the Greek myth, this link between the <b>flower</b> and the myth became firmly part of western culture. The narcissus or daffodil is the most loved of all English plants, and appears frequently in English literature. Many English writers have referred to the cultural and symbolic importance of Narcissus). No <b>flower</b> has received more poetic description except the rose and the lily, with poems by authors from John Gower, Shakespeare, Milton (see Roman culture, above), Wordsworth, Shelley and Keats. Frequently the poems deal with self-love derived from Ovid's account. Gower's reference to the yellow <b>flower</b> of the legend has been assumed to be the daffodil or Narcissus, though as with all references in the older literature to the <b>flower</b> that sprang from the youth's death, there is room for some debate as to the exact species of <b>flower</b> indicated, some preferring Crocus. Spenser announces the coming of the Daffodil in Aprill of his Shepheardes Calender (1579).|$|E
5|$|As a {{particularly}} conspicuous forest <b>flower,</b> T. grandiflorum was designated the provincial emblem of Ontario in 1937 (Flora Emblem Act), {{and as the}} state wild <b>flower</b> of Ohio in 1987. As a symbol of Ontario, a stylized trillium <b>flower</b> features prominently on the official flag of the province's French-speaking community. It is also frequently used by the Canadian Heraldic Authority to represent Ontario in grants of arms. Although a network of laws make picking wildflowers illegal in the province on any Crown or provincially owned land, it is not, unlike widely believed, specifically illegal (or necessarily harmful) to pick the species in Ontario.|$|E
5|$|Banksia <b>flower</b> spikes are {{important}} sources of nectar for mammals, insects and birds, particularly honeyeaters. Animals recorded foraging among the <b>flower</b> spikes of B.canei include the yellow-tufted honeyeater (Lichenostomus melanops), and bees, wasps and ants.|$|E
5000|$|Pseudanthia are {{characteristic}} of the daisy and sunflower family (Asteraceae), whose <b>flowers</b> are differentiated into ray <b>flowers</b> and disk <b>flowers,</b> unique to this family. The disk <b>flowers</b> {{in the center of}} the pseudanthium are actinomorphic and the corolla is fused into a tube. <b>Flowers</b> on the periphery are zygomorphic and the corolla has one large lobe (the so-called [...] "petals" [...] of a daisy are individual ray <b>flowers,</b> for example). Either ray or disk <b>flowers</b> may be absent in some plants: Senecio vulgaris lacks ray <b>flowers</b> and Taraxacum officinale lacks disk <b>flowers.</b> The pseudanthium has a whorl of bracts below the <b>flowers,</b> forming an involucre.|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims The {{timing of}} <b>flowering</b> within and among {{individuals}} is of fundamental biological importance {{because of its}} influence on total seed production and, ultimately, fitness. Traditional descriptive parameters of <b>flowering</b> phenology focus on onset and duration of <b>flowering</b> and on synchrony among individuals. These para-meters do not adequately account for variability in <b>flowering</b> across the <b>flowering</b> duration at individual and population level. This study aims to analyse the <b>flowering</b> phenology of wind-pollinated Juncus species that {{has been described as}} temporally highly variable (‘pulsed flowering’). Additionally, an attempt is made to identify proximate environmental factors that may cue the <b>flowering,</b> and ultimate causes for the <b>flowering</b> patterns are discussed. †Methods <b>Flowering</b> phenology was examined in populations of nine Juncus species by estimating <b>flowering</b> syn-chrony and by using the coefficient of variation (CV) to describe the temporal variation in <b>flowering</b> on individual and population levels. Phenologies were compared with null models to test which patterns deviate from random <b>flowering.</b> All parameters assessed were compared with each other and the performance of the parameters in response to randomization and varying synchrony was evaluated using a model population. <b>Flowering</b> patterns were correlated with temperature and humidity. †Key Results Most <b>flowering</b> patterns of Juncus were best described as synchronous pulsed <b>flowering,</b> characterized as population-wide concerted <b>flowering</b> events separated by days with no or few open <b>flowers.</b> <b>Flowering</b> synchron...|$|R
50|$|<b>Flowers</b> are white. <b>Flowers</b> appear {{soon after}} the vine emerges. The <b>flowers</b> are monoecious, that is, {{individual}} <b>flowers</b> are either male or female, but both sexes {{can be found on}} the same plant. Male <b>flowers</b> appear in open spikes while females <b>flowers,</b> distinguished by a swollen base, usually appear individually and hang down from the axis of the male flower-spike. The plant is self-fertile, i.e. pollen from the male <b>flowers</b> can fertilize the female <b>flowers</b> on the same plant; pollination is by insects.|$|R

5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium {{differs from}} other species within the genus Eriophorum in its habitat and morphology. Its {{multiple}} <b>flower</b> heads and growth from rhizomes {{distinguish it from}} E.vaginatum, which has a single <b>flower</b> head and grows from dense tussocks. Although E.latifolium has 2–12 <b>flower</b> heads, it has laxly caespitose (tufted) growth, and its pappi are forked. The smooth peduncles and preference for acidic soil pH distinguishes E.angustifolium from E.gracile, which grows in swamp with a neutral pH and has scabrid (rough) peduncles.|$|E
5|$|<b>Flower</b> was {{intended}} as a spiritual successor to Flow. Using the PlayStation 3's motion sensitive controller, the player controls wind that blows a <b>flower</b> petal through the air. Flying close to flowers results in the player's petal being followed by other <b>flower</b> petals. Approaching flowers may also have side-effects on the game world, such as bringing vibrant color to previously dead fields or activating stationary windmills. The game features no text or dialogue, forming a narrative arc primarily through visual representation and emotional cues. It was released for the PlayStation 3 on February 12, 2009.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} prevent her boyfriend Minto from going to another little girl named Cocco, Papri must collect ten {{different}} <b>flowers</b> and return them to her boyfriend's house. <b>Flowers</b> must be caught in full bloom so {{that the number of}} <b>flowers</b> in her possession will increase; catching <b>flowers</b> too early will consider the <b>flowers</b> to be wasted and <b>flowers</b> caught too late will be wilted. Wilted <b>flowers</b> will ruin the bouquet, causing the player to lose half of the <b>flowers.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to chasmogamous <b>flowers,</b> are minute, bud-like cleistogamous ("closed marriage") <b>flowers,</b> and pollination of cleistogamous <b>flowers</b> is cleistogamy. Unlike chasmogamous <b>flowers,</b> cleistogamous <b>flowers</b> remain mechanically sealed throughout {{the entirety of}} their development and reproduction. The closed morphology of cleistogamous <b>flowers</b> hinders them from exposing their reproductive organs and forces self-pollination. Without the need for pollinating agents, cleistogamous <b>flowers</b> lack nectar and elaborate petals, making them much less costly to produce than chasmogamous <b>flowers</b> and developmentally favored in suboptimal conditions.|$|R
50|$|Green or fawn {{coloured}} <b>flowers</b> {{form from}} October to January, though occasionally {{as early as}} July. Male and female <b>flowers</b> are on different trees.

5|$|In {{at least}} some species, once a {{bumblebee}} has visited a <b>flower,</b> it leaves a scent mark on it. This scent mark deters bumblebees from visiting that <b>flower</b> until the scent degrades. This scent mark is a general chemical bouquet that bumblebees leave behind in different locations (e.g. nest, neutral, and food sites), and they learn to use this bouquet to identify both rewarding and unrewarding flowers, and {{may be able to}} identify who else has visited a <b>flower.</b> Bumblebees rely on this chemical bouquet more when the <b>flower</b> has a high handling time, that is, where it takes a longer time for the bee to find the nectar once inside the <b>flower.</b>|$|E
