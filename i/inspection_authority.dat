5|$|Initial plans {{called for}} {{operations}} to commence on 1January 2000, but this soon proved difficult. In November, NSB paid {{out the other}} major shareholders, and were left with an 89% ownership of the company. The company needed dispensation from the Norwegian Labour <b>Inspection</b> <b>Authority</b> to allow temporary employments of engineers. When the company had announced the positions, only one engineer had applied for the twelve jobs. Instead an agreement was made with NSB to rent personnel, thus delaying the start until 3September. But because the engineers needed to be recertified, the start was delayed again, to 5November. In the end, Timetoget was forced to recruit and train new drivers. It received criticism for not having as extensive training as NSB, but the company stated that this would not affect safety. The labor union recommended its members not to apply for jobs with Timetoget, since they did not provide a pension agreement, collective bargaining or guarantees to return to NSB, should the concept fail.|$|E

The debate had ensured for half a year {{by the time the}} Tønseth report was published, and the mining company's on-site director, lacking regular postal service and thus ready access to newspapers, was not able to accurately correct any errors in the press. The publication of the report and the delay until the company could respond caused Parliament to delay its summer leave past 20 June 1963. That day Kjell Holler resigned as Minister of Industry and was replaced by Trygve Lie. The issue was debated in Parliament from 20 to 23 August, where the opposition criticized the government for a series of management errors, such as not ensuring that the Labor <b>Inspection</b> <b>Authority</b> had sufficient mining competence.|$|E

40|$|In Belgium, the {{inspection}} of sprayers is performed by official and mobile teams ruled by two regional <b>inspection</b> <b>authorities,</b> ILVO and CRA-W. The management of {{the inspection}} {{is done by the}} Federal Ministry for Consumer Protection, Public Health and the Environment (FAVV). <b>Inspection</b> <b>authorities</b> need to have an ISO 17020 certification, consequently the Belgian inspection is completely independent and objective. FAVV delegates the inspection to one inspection service per region (one for the Walloon part and one for the Flemish part). In this way inspection results are centralized and easily consultable. The inspection results are a very useful tool to have an overview of the general condition of the Belgian sprayers. Those results can be helpful when advising on changes in legislation.

50|$|Much {{more common}} {{in recent years is}} soft censorship, defined as indirect, “often {{financial}} pressure, intended to weaken the capacities and even threaten the viability” of media outlets, especially those that criticize the government and the ruling party. Specifically, soft censorship refers to the attempt by government to influence media outlets through various forms of pressures, without using legal bans, open censorship of content or physical attacks against journalists. There are at least three forms of soft censorship: abuse of public funds; abuse of regulatory and <b>inspection</b> <b>authorities,</b> and paralegal pressures. In Montenegro, soft censorship is exerted mainly through financial pressure, that is to say through allocation of advertising services by public institutions to favored media outlets, selective distribution of subsidies and other state funds, paid content, and the like.|$|R
