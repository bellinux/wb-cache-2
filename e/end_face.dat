25|$|Semiconductor optical {{amplifiers}} (SOAs) are amplifiers {{which use}} a semiconductor {{to provide the}} gain medium. These amplifiers have a similar structure to Fabry–Pérot laser diodes but with anti-reflection design elements at the end faces. Recent designs include anti-reflective coatings and tilted wave guide and window regions which can reduce <b>end</b> <b>face</b> reflection to less than 0.001%. Since this creates a loss of power from the cavity which {{is greater than the}} gain, it prevents the amplifier from acting as a laser. Another type of SOA consists of two regions. One part has a structure of a Fabry-Pérot laser diode and the other has a tapered geometry {{in order to reduce the}} power density on the output facet.|$|E

2500|$|As {{in other}} lasers, the gain region is {{surrounded}} with an optical cavity {{to form a}} laser. In the simplest form of laser diode, an optical waveguide is made on that crystal's surface, such that the light is confined to a relatively narrow line. The two ends of the crystal are cleaved to form perfectly smooth, parallel edges, forming a Fabry–Pérot resonator. Photons emitted into a mode of the waveguide will travel along the waveguide and be reflected several times from each <b>end</b> <b>face</b> before they exit. As a light wave passes through the cavity, it is amplified by stimulated emission, but light is also lost due to absorption and by incomplete reflection from the end facets. Finally, if there is more amplification than loss, the diode begins to [...] "lase".|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluated}} transmembrane potential {{changes at}} the ends of isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes during defibrillation-strength shocks given in the cellular refractory period. The myocytes were stimulated (Si pulse) to produce an action potential. Then a constant-field shock (S 2 pulse) with an electric field of 20 or 40 V/cm was given at an S 1 -S 2 interval of 50 msec. The cells were stained with potentiometric dye (di- 4 -ANEPPS), and the cell <b>end</b> <b>facing</b> the S 2 anode or cathode was illuminated with a laser while the fluorescence was recorded. During S 2, the cell <b>end</b> <b>facing</b> the S 2 cathode became more positive intracellu-larly, whereas the cell <b>end</b> <b>facing</b> the S 2 anode became more negative intracellularly. The S 2 -induced transmembrane potential change at the cell end (AVm) was determined relative to the amplitude of the Si-induced action potential (APA) in each recording (i. e., AVm/APA). In Tyrode's solution containing 4. 5 mM potassium, AVm/APA for 40 -V/cm S 2 was 1. 36 + 0. 34 at the cell <b>end</b> <b>facing</b> the S 2 cathode and- 1. 65 + 0. 61 at the cell <b>end</b> <b>facing</b> the S 2 anode (n= 9). For the 20 -V/cm S 2, AVMAPA was 0. 61 i 0. 33 at the cell <b>end</b> <b>facing</b> the S 2 cathode and- 0. 71 i 0. 33 at the cell <b>end</b> <b>facing</b> the S 2 anode (n= 6).

40|$|AbstractThis paper applied RANS solver and angular {{momentum}} current analyzing method {{to study the}} effect of gap flow in a rim driven thruster on the torque of the blades when the propeller {{was replaced by a}} rotating disk. The rim's torque was divided into two parts, outer surface and <b>end</b> <b>faces.</b> The torque of outer surface was resulted by turbulent Taylor vortex flow in the radial gap between inner and outer cylinder. The torque of <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> was resulted by radial outflow and inflow in the axial gap. Based on N-S equations {{angular momentum}} current was conserved in radial gap by neglecting of influence of <b>end</b> <b>faces.</b> We employed RANS solver to investigate the effect of the ratio between inner and outer cylinder radius on the torque of the outer surface by keeping the axial gap ratio. As such the effect of axial gap ratio on the torque of <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> was explored by holding radial gap ratio. Whereafter angular momentum current conservation was applied to obtain a predicted formula to calculate the torque of the outer surface. A new predicted method of calculating the torque of <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> was obtained by fitting the CFD calculated results. Finally the developed method was validated by experiments in the large cavitation tunnel of CSSRC.

The {{non-contact}} {{mechanical seal}} <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> opening friction condition detection and {{the measurement of}} film thickness when the <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> is just-lift-off, which are always key problems for scholars engaged in sealing industry for many years, {{but there is no}} effective solution. Acoustic emission(AE) signal generated in the running process of mechanical seal <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> has a plenty of information about the faces contact state. According to this, the thickness measurement of mechanical seal and opening condition monitoring technology by using particle filter are put forward based on the acoustic emission signal. Acoustic emission sensor is installed in the stationary ring seat, used for the indirect outer detection of the dynamic and stationary rings opening condition. The acoustic emission signals are processed by particle filter technology, and then the signal features are extracted in time domain, frequency domain and wavelet packet energy. A BP neural network model is established, the features of signal characteristic used as input of the model. It is finally realized that the mechanical seal <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> opening condition was recognized and the film thickness was measured. Eddy current sensor is installed inside the stationary ring and used for direct measurement of film thickness and verify the results got from the BP neural network. Through the experiment, this method is practical and effective, and which can be used in the monitoring of mechanical seal <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> working condition in industrial field...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThere is a {{transition}} of metal from the lateral and <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> of a continuously cast slab {{to the broad}} surface of the plate during the rolling process. The process of metal transition to the wide sides of the plate {{is the process of}} defect formation, because surface cracks and defects from the side and <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> transfer to the front surfaces of the plate. When rolling is over the cracks are located on the edges of the plate while the width corresponds to the width of the transition strips. Longitudinal edge cracking during plate hot rolling can occur as a consequence the following three factors combination: 1) transition of metal from the lateral and <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> to the broad surfaces of the strip; 2) the occurrence of tensile stresses during the metal transition; 3) reduced plasticity of the slab edges due to the lower temperature (≈ 900 - 950 °C). Significant shift of cracks from the edges takes place due to the transition of metal from the lateral and <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> to the broad surfaces because of the uneven range across the thickness. There is a significant temperature gradient even at 15 - 20 °C...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{measurement}} of mechanical sealing film thickness and just-lift-off time is very difficult, the sealing film condition monitoring method based on acoustic emission signal is proposed. The mechanical seal acoustic emission signal present obvious characteristics of time-varying nonlinear and pulsating. In this paper, the acoustic emission signal is used to monitor the seal <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> just-lift-off time and friction condition. The acoustic emission signal is decomposed by empirical mode decomposition {{into a series of}} intrinsic mode function with independent characteristics of different time scales and different frequency band. The acoustic emission signal only generated by <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> friction is obtained by eliminating the false intrinsic mode function components. The correlation coefficient of acoustic emission signal and Multi-scale Laplace Wavelet is calculated. It is proved that the maximum frequency (8000 Hz) of the correlation coefficient is appeared at the spindle speed of 300 rpm. And at this time (300 rpm) the <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> have just lifted off. By a set of mechanical oil seal running test, it is demonstrated that this method could accurately identify mechanical seal <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> just-lift-off time and friction condition. ...|$|R
