40|$|Objective: To {{characterize}} {{physically and}} chemically, non-sweetened orange juices and orange nectars sweetened with sucrose or sweet <b>flavoring</b> <b>agents,</b> {{with respect to}} their pH, titratable acidity (TA) and total soluble solids content (TSSC), as well as to evaluate the correlation of the latter property with the others. Method: Aliquots of three lots of two orange juices and two orange nectars containing sucrose and two containing sweet <b>flavoring</b> <b>agents</b> were evaluated. Mineral water was used as a control. The TSSC was determined using an Abbe refractometer. The pH was recorded using a digital pH meter, while TA was quantified by titrating samples of the beverages with 0. 1 M NaOH until reaching pHs 5. 5 and 7. 0. Data were subjected to Pearson's correlation test, regression analysis, analysis of variance and Tukey's test (α= 0. 05). Results: TSSC values presented a strong correlation with TA, and these properties exhibited a quadratic relationship. Although the pH values were not dependent on the presence of sucrose or sweet <b>flavoring</b> <b>agents,</b> a significantly greater amount of base was necessary to reach pHs 5. 5 and 7. 0 in the beverages without sucrose or <b>flavoring</b> <b>agents.</b> Conclusion: Orange juices and nectars presented similar pH values, which was not associated with the presence of sucrose or sweet <b>flavoring</b> <b>agents</b> in the beverages. Higher TA values were obtained for the juice and lower for the nectars, regardless of containing sucrose or sweet <b>flavoring</b> <b>agents.</b> The increase of TSSC did not implicate in decrease of TA in the beverages...|$|R
