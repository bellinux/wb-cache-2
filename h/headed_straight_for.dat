Until the 1820s the road still {{used the same}} {{crossing}} point despite the river's having moved from it at some time, probably well over a thousand years before. At Park Wood, the road appears to have {{come close to the}} Car Dyke but this is not well supported by evidence.

25|$|At {{the moment}} the {{stabilizer}} separated from the aircraft, the plane pitched downwards, <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> Belle Harbor. As the pilots struggled to control the aircraft, it went into a flat spin. The resulting aerodynamic loads sheared both engines from the aircraft seconds before impact. The engines landed several blocks north and east of the main wreckage site. Losing the engines cut off power to the FDR at 9:16:00, while the CVR (cockpit voice recorder), utilizing a battery backup, cut off at 9:16:15 moments before impact with the ground. The main impact location was the intersection of Newport Avenue and Beach 131st Street.|$|E

After that defeat, Borg {{walked off}} the court {{and out of the}} stadium before the ceremonies and press conference had begun, and <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> the airport. There are reports that Borg {{received}} threats after his semifinal win over Connors. In later years, Borg apologized to McEnroe. The 1981 US Open would be the Swede's last Grand Slam final. Major tournaments and tour organizers were enforcing a new rule; by 1982, that players had to play at least 10 official tournaments per year. However, Borg wanted to curtail his schedule after many years of winning so often. Although he felt in good condition physically, he recognized that the relentless drive to win and defy tour organizers had begun to fade.|$|E

25|$|On March 14, the {{monitors}} told Palestinian authorities {{at the prison}} they were getting their car fixed. Then they <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> the Israeli checkpoint on the road out of Jericho. At around 09:00, Israeli soldiers stationed at the checkpoint spotted {{the monitors}} leaving the city. Immediately after, special forces, backed up by tanks, converged on the prison in order to force the wanted men out. At around 09:30, some 100 Israeli soldiers were surrounding the prison. By {{the end of the}} siege, the IDF had committed a force of approximately 1,000 soldiers from an armored division. Reports from the scene said 50 jeeps, three tanks, and an armored bulldozer pushed into Jericho, and two helicopters were flying overhead. At the time of the raid, there were a total of 200 prisoners and guards in the prison.|$|E
25|$|Merchant sailors {{were trained}} {{and used to}} man the {{anti-aircraft}} gun, it fired continually throughout the battle though it misfired a few times because of old ammunition. In fifteen minutes of fighting the Stanvac Calcutta was struck {{several times in the}} bridge and elsewhere, killing Captain Karlsson and a few other men. After hitting the Stier the guards manning the 4-inch gun were reported to have been encouraged and continued firing accurately until shrapnel damaged their weapon. The sights were destroyed but the Americans continued shooting until the ammunition on deck was exhausted. At this time Ensign Anderson ordered two men to retrieve more ammunition from below deck though as soon as they left, Captain Gerlach maneuvered his ship for a torpedo attack. When lined up, Stier fired one torpedo and it dove into the water and <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> Stanvac Calcutta where it detonated on the port side. Water began flowing in and the vessel started listing. A number of additional men were killed in the torpedo explosion and when {{it was clear that the}} American ship could not be saved, Ensign Anderson ordered the survivors to abandon ship and he began to lower life rafts.|$|E

500|$|At 02:56 on 29 November, Shinano {{turned to}} the {{southwest}} and <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> Archerfish. Eight minutes later, Archerfish turned east and submerged in preparation to attack. Enright ordered his torpedoes set for a depth of [...] in case they ran deeper than set; he also intended to increase the chances of capsizing the ship by punching holes higher up in the hull. A few minutes later, Shinano turned south, exposing her entire side to Archerfish—a nearly ideal firing situation for a submarine. [...] The escorting destroyer on that side passed right over Archerfish without detecting her. At 03:15 Archerfish fired six torpedoes before diving to [...] to escape a depth charge attack from the escorts.|$|E
500|$|Later that month, {{during his}} fifth combat with American pilots, he shot down two more P-51s before {{being forced to}} bail out, when eight other P-51s ran his Messerschmitt out of fuel. During the intense manoeuvring, Hartmann managed to line {{up one of the}} P-51s at close range, but heard only a [...] "clank" [...] when he fired, as he had run out of ammunition. While he was hanging in his parachute, the P-51s circled above him, and Hartmann {{wondered}} if they would take this opportunity to kill him. One of the P-51Bs flown by Lt. Robert J. Goebel of the 308th Squadron, 31st Fighter Group, broke away and <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> him. Goebel was making a camera pass to record the bailout and banked away from him only at the last moment, waving at Hartmann as he went by.|$|E
500|$|Under {{the command}} of Captain Thomas S. Rodgers, New York <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> Veracruz {{following}} its commissioning. She was designated flagship for Rear Admiral Frank Friday Fletcher in July 1914, commanding the fleet occupying and blockading Veracruz to prevent arms shipments from arriving there to support the government of Victoriano Huerta. The United States occupation of Veracruz ultimately ended and New York resumed her shakedown cruise along the East Coast of the United States. She also undertook several goodwill duties, and in December 1915 she held a high-profile Christmas party and dinner for several hundred orphans from New York City, {{at the suggestion of}} her crew. It later became a tradition on the ship to help the underprivileged when possible, earning it the nickname [...] "Christmas Ship." [...] Following this duty, she undertook a number of training exercises off the Atlantic coast.|$|E

2500|$|The {{submarine}} was cruising on {{the surface}} about [...] south of Penang, Malaysia just off the western mouth of the Strait of Malacca when it was discovered by the British submarine , {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Commander Leslie Bennington of the 4th Submarine Flotilla. Tally-Ho was campaigning in the strait, where she sank several axis vessels. Bennington was also cruising {{on the surface}}, patrolling for Japanese shipping, when she sighted UIT-23 in the daytime.

2500|$|Tambor {{returned}} to Pearl Harbor on 15 December 1943 and held refresher training during {{the remainder of}} the month. She began her ninth war patrol on 5 January 1944. Her assigned area was in the East China Sea. She sighted a Natori-class cruiser on 22 January, but lost contact in a rain squall. Six days later, she contacted a convoy of nine ships heading north and tracked it until 01:56 the next day. She then fired two torpedoes at a cargo ship in a surface attack. Both hit and sent Shuntai Maru down by the bow. An escort <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> the submarine and ramming seemed inevitable. Tambor opened fire with her aft 20-millimeter gun and turned hard to port causing the escort to pass [...] astern.

2500|$|In {{light of}} his {{obstacle}} being removed, Huang <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> Luoyang; on the way, he stopped pillaging other than to force young men into his army and adding to its numbers. Luoyang quickly fell and was captured on 22 December 880. Emperor Xizong and Tian Lingzi conscripted a new army and put Zhang Chengfan (張承範) in charge of it, having him rendezvous with Qi at Tong Pass to defend against Huang's advance toward Chang'an. However, Emperor Xizong and Tian were instead making plans to flee to Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), where Tian's brother Chen Jingxuan was military governor. As soon as news arrived that Huang had defeated Zhang and Qi and was advancing quickly toward Chang'an, Emperor Xizong and Tian abandoned Chang'an and fled toward Chengdu, arriving there in early 881. [...] Huang entered Chang'an and declared himself the emperor of a new state of Qi. He slaughtered members of the Tang imperial family {{and a large number}} of high level officials, but tried to keep the Tang governmental apparatus in place for some time, hoping to get Tang generals and officials to switch loyalty.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, {{after two}} or three broadsides {{exchanged}} with Alliance, less than 20 minutes after the first shot, Captain Piercy was astonished to see his opponent (with just one of the little [...] shots from the Countess of Scarborough stuck in its tough timberwork) move away to rejoin Pallas, which was still waiting for an opportunity to be useful. Landais later claimed that his opponent had sailed away under cover of smoke. Piercy, his ship relatively unharmed, and out of range of any of the four Americans, <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> the main battle, {{to see if he could}} help Serapis, but Jones’s close-quarters policy meant that to intervene now would be madness. Quite possibly shots fired by the Countess of Scarborough at the Bonhomme Richard would hit Serapis, or worse still, massive [...] shots from Serapis could accidentally hit the Countess of Scarborough. Instead, Piercy simply gave the impression that he was going to intervene, trying to attract the attention of Alliance and Pallas. Cottineau saw the potential danger (or responded to a request by Landais) and quickly steered towards the Countess of Scarborough, so Piercy slowly retreated, sailing with the wind.|$|E

2500|$|After {{returning}} to the patrol area with the wolf pack, she made an unsuccessful attack on a transport on 3 November. The following day, Sailfish damaged two destroyers but was slightly damaged herself by a bomb from a patrol aircraft. With battle damage under control, Sailfish eluded her pursuers and cleared the area. After riding out a typhoon on 9–10 November, she intercepted a convoy {{on the evening of}} 24 November heading for Itbayat in the Philippines. After alerting Pomfret of the convoy's location and course, Sailfish was moving into an attack position when one of the escorting destroyers <b>headed</b> <b>straight</b> <b>for</b> her. Sailfish fired a three-torpedo spread [...] "down the throat" [...] and headed toward the main convoy. At least one hit was scored on the destroyer and her pip faded from the radar screen. Suddenly, Sailfish received an unwelcome surprise when she came under fire from the destroyer that she had believed to be sunk. Sailfish ran deep after ascertaining there was no hull damage resulting from a near miss from the escort's guns. For the next 4 hours, Sailfish was forced to run silent and deep as the Japanese kept up an uncomfortably accurate depth charge attack. Finally, the submarine was able to elude the destroyers and slip away. Shortly, Sailfish headed for Hawaii, via Midway, and completed her 12th and final war patrol upon arriving at Pearl Harbor on 11 December. Sailfish had damaged the IJN destroyer , which had previously sunk , and also a landing ship.|$|E
