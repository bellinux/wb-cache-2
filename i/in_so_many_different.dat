The United States was especially known {{for one of}} these subgenres, thrash metal, which was innovated by bands like Anthrax, Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Testament, Exodus, Nuclear Assault, Death Angel, Mono Men, The DT's, OFF!, and Overkill, with Metallica being the most commercially successful. The United States was {{known as one of the}} birthplaces of Death Metal during the mid to late 1980s. The Florida scene was the most well-known, featuring bands like Death, Morbid Angel, Deicide, Cannibal Corpse, Malevolent Creation, Obituary, and many others.

25|$|The single genetic {{regulatory}} network hypothesis {{proposes that}} domestication syndrome results from mutations in genes that regulate the expression pattern of more downstream genes. For example piebald, or spotted coat coloration, {{may be caused}} by a linkage in the biochemical pathways of melanins involved in coat coloration and neurotransmitters such as dopamine that help shape behavior and cognition. These linked traits may arise from mutations in a few key regulatory genes. A problem with this hypothesis is that it proposes that there are mutations in gene networks that cause dramatic effects that are not lethal, however no currently known genetic regulatory networks cause such dramatic change <b>in</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> traits.|$|E

25|$|Opitz {{argues that}} the binding of {{different}} brain areas is mediated by the hippocampus. Relational bindings, or relationships between separate objects, concepts, and memories, are very flexible because the targets can be combined <b>in</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> {{ways to deal with}} the present situation, and the hippocampus ensures that these parts are arranged into a coherent whole. Particularly, the hippocampus has been implicated in binding that is involved with episodic memory, working memory, and language acquisition. According to Opitz, this is viable because the hippocampus meets all criteria to be suitable for the regulation relational binding and, based on its patterns of activity, it is likely that it is involved.|$|E
25|$|Assembling a {{comprehensive}} Jacques Brel discography is difficult, because his recordings {{have been released}} <b>in</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> permutations, in different countries and in different formats. Furthermore, releases of Brel's recordings are sometimes known by different titles. This discography is restricted to Brel's original albums, as collected and reissued on 23 September 2003 in the sixteen CD box set of his work Boîte à Bonbons, plus the additional album Chansons ou Versions Inédites de Jeunesse, which was released {{for the first time}} as part of this box set. The titles listed here are the titles used in the box set. To mark the 25th anniversary of Brel's death, Barclay Records issued Comme quand on était beau (2003), a 3 volume DVD collection of Brel interviews and live performances as well as the compilation album Infiniment (2004). Both releases include five previously unpublished songs that Brel wrote in 1977: La Cathédrale, L'Amour est mort, Mai 40, Avec Élégance, and Sans Exigences.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{the first major}} American bands began appearing, like Blue Öyster Cult and Aerosmith, and musicians like Eddie Van Halen began their career. Heavy metal remained, however, a largely {{underground}} phenomenon. During the 1980s, a pop-based form of hard rock, with a party-hearty spirit and a glam-influenced visual aesthetic (sometimes referred to as [...] "hair metal") dominated the music charts, led by superstars like Poison, Bon Jovi, Mötley Crüe, and Ratt. The 1987 debut of Guns N' Roses, a hard rock band whose image reflected the grittier underbelly of the Sunset Strip, was {{at least in part}} a reaction against the overly polished image of hair metal, but that band's wild success was in many ways the last gasp of the hard-rock and metal scene. By the mid-1980s, as the term [...] "heavy metal" [...] became the subject of much contestation, the style had branched out <b>in</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> directions that new classifications were created by fans, record companies, and fanzines, although sometimes the differences between various subgenres were unclear, even to the artists purportedly belonging to a given style. The most notable of the 1980s metal subgenres in the United States was the swift and aggressive thrash metal style, pioneered by bands like Anthrax, Megadeth, Metallica, and Slayer.|$|E

40|$|The Rho {{proteins}} play critical {{roles in}} numerous aspects of neuronal development, and mutations in their regulators (GEFs and GAPs) and effectors underlie multiple neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders. How Rho GTPase-mediated signaling {{can have a}} hand <b>in</b> regulating <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> neurobiological processes remains a challenging question. An emerging theme is that GAPs and GEFs, through their spatial/temporal regulation and/or through additional protein-protein interactions, cooperate in making connections between upstream signals and the downstream signaling output, engaging distinct effector proteins. This chapter focuses on recent evidence illustrating distinct modes of regulation and specialized roles of Rho regulators particularly {{in the context of}} synaptic structure, function, and plasticity, and how their dysregulation affects behavioral processes and contributes to disease. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Wien.

Biographer Thomas Forget added, [...] "Because he has succeeded <b>in</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> styles of music, {{it is almost}} impossible to find a popular artist today that has not been influenced by David Bowie." [...] In 2000, Bowie was voted by other music stars as the [...] "most influential artist of all time" [...] in a poll by NME. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote that Bowie was confirmed by 1980 to be [...] "the most important and influential artist since the Beatles". Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph stated that Bowie had [...] "one of the supreme careers in popular music, art and culture of the 20th century" [...] and [...] "he was too inventive, too mercurial, too strange for all but his most devoted fans to keep up with". The BBC's Mark Easton argued that Bowie provided fuel for [...] "the creative powerhouse that Britain has become" [...] by challenging future generations [...] "to aim high, to be ambitious and provocative, to take risks".

But there are things that we feel are entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we can’t otherwise access. And we think that if it’s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for doing those episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s self-actualization, that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you have to be on your own. You have to walk the path that you believe in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to do that for us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William <b>in</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> ways. So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and the man from the blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "It’s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, there are things you think you have time to explore in any given season, but don’t. But yes, we are very interested in that moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E

She {{threatened}} to wear black tape {{over her mouth}} on the song's music video due to her disagreement with its message and the choice {{for it to be}} CrazySexyCool lead single, partially because of the group's history of advocating for safe sex since their debut. [...] "I was totally, 100% against 'Creep'. I wasn't down with cheating on your man, you know, for me, it's be faithful. Trust me, I fought against that single coming out. You know, I was like 'If a girl is gonna [...] catch her man cheating,' this was my thing, 'instead of telling her to cheat back, why don't we tell her [...] just leave,'" [...] she shared. In the end, Lopes eventually capitulated, stating: [...] "If some people can creep, and in their minds, they can feel better by going out doing the same thing... Fine. I'm just not one of those people." [...] She instead added her new rap verse on remixed versions of the song, which talks about the consequences of cheating. Thomas later thought the song and the video's choreography routine were [...] "cool" [...] enough to distract people from its lyrical content and [...] "just sing along." [...] "Even the song 'Creep'—not that we creep, but if we did, [...] for a woman that would do such a thing.
