5|$|Peruvian {{officials}} named Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> as {{the lone}} {{suspect in the}} homicide investigation. Interpol issued an international arrest warrant for Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot,</b> believing that he had fled the country to Chile, possibly intending to return to Aruba through Argentina. Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> was sighted entering Chile via the Chacalluta border crossing, north of Arica, on 31 May 2010. His ex-girlfriend, Melody Granadillo, said that Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> sent her a text message asking for {{money to buy a}} ticket back to Aruba.|$|E
5|$|In August 2014, Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> was {{transferred}} to Challapalca prison in the mountainous South of Peru, where circumstances are harsh due to the location's altitude. Two months later, a Dutch online news service claimed that Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> was stabbed and critically injured by fellow prisoners in Peru. Although Van der Sloot's wife's claim of a stabbing is contested by Peruvian authorities, photos have been published showing Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> as suffering from multiple stab wounds from two separate attacks.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} his release, Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> gave several interviews that explained {{his version of}} events. The most notable discussion included a lengthy interview with Fox News that aired over three nights in March 2006. During the interview, Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> indicated that Holloway wanted {{to have sex with}} him, but he did not because he didn't have a condom. Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> stated that Holloway wanted them to stay on the beach, but that {{he had to go to}} school in the morning. According to Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot,</b> he was picked up by Satish Kalpoe at about 3:00am and left Holloway sitting on the beach. In August 2005, David Kock, Satish Kalpoe's attorney, stated that his client had gone to sleep, and had not returned to drive Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> home. Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> stated that he was somewhat ashamed to have left a young woman alone on the beach, albeit by her own request, and related that he was not truthful at first because he was convinced that Holloway would soon turn up.|$|E
50|$|Weeks {{after the}} book was {{released}} on April 1, 2007, a new search involving around twenty investigators was launched at Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> parents' home on Aruba. Dutch authorities did not comment on what prompted the new search, {{except that it was}} not related to Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> book. Natalee's father Dave Holloway said that he did not think the book provided any new information beyond Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> original statements that could help the ongoing investigation.|$|R
5|$|After Flores's family {{reported}} her missing, police {{retrieved the}} hotel surveillance tape and obtained Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> name and national identification number. Her brother's wife discovered Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> background in a Google search {{about an hour}} before her body was found.|$|R

5|$|On 3 June 2010, the U.S. District Court of Northern Alabama charged Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> with {{extortion}} {{and wire}} fraud. U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance issued {{an arrest warrant}} through Interpol to have Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> prosecuted in the United States. On 4 June, {{at the request of}} the U.S. Justice Department, Dutch authorities raided and confiscated items from two homes in the Netherlands, one of them belonging to reporter Jaap Amesz, who had previously interviewed Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> and claimed knowledge of his criminal activities. Aruban investigators used information gathered from the extortion case to launch a new search at a beach, but no new evidence was found. Aruba's Solicitor-General said they would not seek Van der Sloot's extradition to Aruba. On 30 June, a federal grand jury formally indicted Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> of the two charges. The indictment filed with the U.S. District Court seeks the forfeiture of the $25,100 that had been paid to Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot.</b>|$|E
5|$|A book by Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> and {{reporter}} Zvezdana Vukojevic, De zaak Natalee Holloway (The Case of Natalee Holloway) {{was published}} in Dutch in April 2007. In the book, Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> gives his perspective of the night Holloway disappeared and the media frenzy that followed. He admits and apologizes for his initial untruths, but maintains his innocence.|$|E
5|$|On 10 May, Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> {{allegedly}} {{accepted the}} amount of $15,000 by wire transfer to his account in the Netherlands, following a cash payment of $10,000 that was videotaped by undercover investigators in Aruba. In exchange, Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> told Kelly that his father buried Holloway's remains in {{the foundation of a}} house. Authorities determined that this information was false, because the house had not yet been built at the time of Holloway's disappearance. Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> later e-mailed Kelly that he lied about the house. Holloway was shocked that the FBI did not promptly file extortion charges against Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot,</b> allowing him to leave freely with the money to Bogotá, Colombia, on his way to Lima, Peru. The FBI and the office of the U.S. Attorney contended that the case had not yet been sufficiently developed.|$|E

500|$|On 27 April 2007, a new search {{involving}} {{some twenty}} investigators was launched at Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> parents' home on Aruba. Dutch authorities searched {{the yard and}} surrounding area, using shovels and thin metal rods to penetrate the dirt. A spokesman for the prosecutor's office, Vivian van der Biezen, stated [...] "The investigation has never stopped and the Dutch authorities are completely reviewing the case for new indications". A statement released directly from the prosecutor's office stated: [...] "The team has indications that justify a more thorough search." [...] Investigators did not comment on what prompted the new search, {{except that it was}} not related to Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> book.|$|R
5|$|On 9 March 2014, the Peruvian {{government}} announced that Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> would face extradition to the United States {{in the year}} 2038 to face charges of extortion and wire fraud, after completion of his 28-year sentence in Peru {{for the murder of}} Stephany Tatiana Flores Ramírez (see below). In February 2016, an undercover reporter filmed Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> confessing to Natalee Holloway's murder. The film shows Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot,</b> in Dutch, laughing over how he never told the truth about the whole event and that he did in fact kill Natalee. His Peruvian wife is also present during this conversation.|$|E
5|$|On February 8, 2008, Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> {{met with}} Aruban {{investigators}} in the Netherlands and denied {{that what he}} said on the tape was true, stating that he was {{under the influence of}} marijuana at the time. Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> indicated that he still maintains that he left Holloway behind on the beach.|$|E
5|$|On March 29, 2010, Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> {{contacted}} John Q. Kelly—Beth Twitty's legal representative—with {{an offer}} to reveal the location of Holloway's body and the circumstances surrounding her death, if he were given advance of US$25,000 against a total of $250,000. After Kelly notified the FBI, they arranged {{to proceed with the}} transaction. On May 10, Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> had a $15,000 wire transferred to his account in the Netherlands, following the receipt of $10,000 in cash that was videotaped by undercover investigators in Aruba. Authorities stated that the information that he provided in return was false because the house in which he said Holloway's body was located had not yet been built {{at the time of her}} disappearance. On June 3, Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> was charged in the U.S. District Court of Northern Alabama with extortion and wire fraud. U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance obtained an arrest warrant and transmitted it to Interpol. On June 30, Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> was indicted on the charges.|$|E
50|$|According to Jossy Mansur, {{managing}} editor of Diaro, reaction to the book was mostly negative. A spokesman from Sijthoff stated that the publisher would not release sales figures of books in its catalog, including Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's.</b>|$|R
50|$|Northeastern University {{professor}} Jack Levin {{stated that}} {{a book is}} an opportunity for suspects of investigations to present their version of events. The Holloway family disputes Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> account of Natalee's disappearance and has accused him of being involved.|$|R
5|$|Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> mother, Anita, {{stated in}} a Dutch {{interview}} {{that her son}} could have killed Flores and that she will not visit him at the prison. She said in another interview that she hopes {{to talk to the}} family of the victim and apologize to them.|$|R
5|$|Surveillance {{video from}} the Atlantic City Casino {{recorded}} Flores winning $10,000 at a baccarat table area on 25 May 2010, while {{accompanied by a}} male friend who was not Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot.</b> According to casino spokesperson Luis Laos, she also won $237 playing poker on 29 May and it was common for people to know the identities of big winners. Laos stated that Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> did not win any money that night. At 3:00a.m. on 30 May, Flores was recorded entering the casino alone and walking to a poker table where Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> was sitting. Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> had not registered for the Latin American Poker Tour. The deadline to pay the $2,700 entry fee for the 2 June event at the casino was 30 May.|$|E
5|$|The Aruban prosecutor's office {{attempted}} {{to obtain an}} arrest warrant for Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> based on the tapes; however, a judge denied the request. The prosecutor appealed the denial, but the appeal failed on February 14, 2008. The appeals {{court held that the}} statements on the tape were inconsistent with evidence in the case and were insufficient to hold Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot.</b>|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} Holloway's missed flight, Jug and Beth Twitty {{and friends}} flew to Aruba by private jet. Within {{four hours of}} landing on the island, the Twittys presented the Aruban police with {{the name and address}} of Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> as the person with whom Holloway left the nightclub. Beth stated that Van der Sloot's full name was given to her by the night manager at the Holiday Inn, who supposedly recognized him on a videotape. The Twittys and their friends went to the Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> home with two Aruban policemen to look for Holloway. Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> initially denied knowing Holloway's name, but he then told the following story, which was corrorborated by Deepak Kalpoe, who was present in the house: Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> related that they drove Holloway to the California Lighthouse area of Arashi Beach because she wanted to see sharks; they later dropped Holloway off at her hotel at around 2:00a.m. According to Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot,</b> Holloway fell down as she exited the car but refused his help. He stated that as he and Kalpoe were driving away, Holloway was approached by a dark man in a black shirt similar to those worn by security guards.|$|E
500|$|On 14 March 2011, the National Police of Peru {{provided}} {{a copy of}} the hard disk drive from Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> laptop computer to the FBI. Colonel Oscar González, of the high tech division of the Peruvian police, stated that the U.S. federal investigation was interested in information related to Holloway's disappearance and the alleged extortion of her family. Peruvian detectives determined that the laptop accessed information about the Holloway case before Flores arrived in Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> hotel room; it was then used to visit two poker websites at around the time Flores was present in the room. According to a police dossier, the laptop was later used to search Google for the subjects: [...] "relationship between the Peruvian and Chilean police", [...] "Chilean border pass", [...] "buses in Chile", and [...] "countries that do not extradite in Latin America." ...|$|R
5|$|Navarro stated, on 21 August 2010, {{that the}} case was stagnating because an {{official}} interpreter was unable to be found for the case in Peru. The Peruvian association of translators and interpreters and the Dutch embassy both separately stated {{at the time that}} they have been unable to locate one to officially translate Spanish into Dutch. Unlike Aruba and the United States, Peru does not guarantee the right to a speedy trial. On 6 September, a Peruvian appeals court voted 2 to 1 to reject Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> motion that he is being unlawfully held. Because 3 votes are required for a decision, if a fourth judge voted in Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> favor, a fifth judge would be required to break the tie. Peruvian statutes permit a suspect to be detained for up to 18 months for interrogation, though Navarro expressed skepticism that law enforcement officers would do so with his client.|$|R
5|$|The {{stains on}} Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> clothes matched Flores' blood type. Blood {{was also found}} on the floor, hallway, and {{mattress}} in the hotel room. Police stated that DNA tests would be conducted on the clothes, skin found under the victim's fingernails, and the previously recovered tennis racquet. Ricardo Flores stated in interviews that his daughter's body needed to be exhumed to gather the fingernail DNA evidence, and that her body had not been cremated for this reason.|$|R
5|$|Joran van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> {{was born}} in Arnhem, Netherlands. He {{is one of three}} sons born to Paulus van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> (1952–2010), a lawyer, and Anita van der Sloot-Hugen, an art teacher. In 1990, his family moved from Arnhem to Aruba, where he was an honor student at the International School of Aruba. He was {{considered}} a star soccer and tennis athlete at the school. Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> competed in doubles tennis with his father at the Moët et Chandon Anniversary Cup in 2005 and hoped to play for Saint Leo University near Tampa, Florida. Van der Sloot's mother said he had a problem with lying and had a tendency to sneak out of the house at night to go to casinos.|$|E
5|$|Navarro {{stated that}} he filed suit against Chinchay, who first {{represented}} Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> during his interrogation, charging her with abuse of authority, conspiracy to commit a crime, and misrepresentation {{because he did not}} find her name on the list of public defenders from Peru's Ministry of Justice. Navarro also filed a complaint against Van der Sloot's translator, insisting that he misrepresented himself as an official translator of the Dutch embassy. Chinchay rejected the claims against her, stating that Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> had selected her as a private attorney after declining another defense attorney appointed by the state. She contradicted his claims that he did not understand what he was signing by stating {{that she was able to}} speak with him in perfect Spanish. She said that Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> was interested in talking about the Holloway case, thinking that it might get him extradited to Aruba. Chinchay also said that when she told Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> that she noticed he was signing various documents with very different signatures, he signaled for her to be quiet.|$|E
5|$|On November 10, 2005, Paulus van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> won {{an unjust}} {{detention}} {{action against the}} Aruban government, clearing him as a suspect and allowing him to retain his government contract. The elder Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> then brought a second action, seeking monetary damages {{for himself and his}} family because of his false arrest. The action was initially successful, but the award of damages was reversed on appeal.|$|E
5|$|Holloway's family, however, {{took the}} {{opposite}} approach and criticized the lessening of coverage of her disappearance {{due to a}} shift in news priority when Hurricane Katrina struck on August 23, 2005. The saturation coverage of Holloway's disappearance was finally eclipsed by the hurricane. Beth Twitty and Dave Holloway alleged that Aruba {{took advantage of the}} extensive coverage of Hurricane Katrina to release the suspects, however the deadline for judicial review of Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> detention was set long before Katrina.|$|R
5000|$|The book {{presents}} Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> {{account of}} the night Holloway disappeared and the media frenzy which followed. Details of his encounter with Holloway at the Carlos'n Charlie's nightclub in Oranjestad, Aruba is covered in explicit detail. He admits to lying {{in the past and}} apologizes for his actions, stating that he [...] "found himself at {{the wrong place at the}} wrong time, and took a wrong decision." [...] However, he insists that he did not break the law and is not a murderer.|$|R
5|$|In 2016 Natalee’s father, Dave Holloway, hired {{a private}} investigator, T.J. Ward, {{to go through}} all {{evidence}} and information related to the disappearance once more. This led to an informant named Gabriel, who claims to have been a roommate of one of Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> closest friends named John back in 2005. Gabriel claims that John was told what happened to Natalee. Gabriel gave a detailed description of what happened on the night of Natalee’s disappearance {{in an interview with the}} Oxygen television channel, which created a new documentary series on Natalee's disappearance. The interview aired on Saturday, August 19, 2017. Using Gabriel's information, the investigator had found what appeared to be human bones. On October 3, 2017, DNA testing concluded that one piece of bone was human but it did not belong to Natalee.|$|R
5|$|The broadcast, {{aired on}} February 3, 2008, {{included}} excerpts from footage recorded from hidden cameras and microphones {{in the vehicle}} of Patrick van der Eem, a Dutch businessman and ex-convict who gained Van der Sloot's confidence. Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> was seen smoking marijuana and stating that he was with Holloway when she began convulsively shaking, then became unresponsive. Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> stated that he attempted to revive her, without success. He said that he called a friend, who told Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> {{to go home and}} who disposed of the body. An individual reputed to be this friend, identified in the broadcast as Daury, has denied Van der Sloot's account, indicating that he was then in Rotterdam at school.|$|E
5|$|Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> (then age 17), {{along with}} the Kalpoe brothers, Deepak (then age 21) and Satish (then age 18), was arrested on 9 June 2005, as {{a suspect in the}} 30 May 2005 {{disappearance}} of an 18-year-old American woman, Natalee Holloway, who was declared legally dead six years after she disappeared. The Kalpoes were released from custody on 4 July, but were re-arrested on 26 August on suspicion of rape and murder, while Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> remained in custody. Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> and the Kalpoes were released on 3 September {{because of a lack of}} evidence. After his release, Van <b>Der</b> <b>Sloot</b> was required to stay within Dutch territory pending the results of the investigation. On 5 September 2005, he returned to the Netherlands to study international business management at the HAN University of Applied Sciences. On 14 September, a higher court removed the travel restrictions. Gerold G. Dompig, former deputy commissioner of the Aruba Police Force, stated that the initial arrests were made prematurely under pressure from Holloway's family. Dompig charged that the family sidetracked the investigation by making it difficult for the police to collect evidence to solve the case.|$|E
5|$|At {{the request}} of the U.S. Justice Department, {{authorities}} conducted a June 4 raid and confiscated items from two homes in the Netherlands. One of the homes belonged to reporter Jaap Amesz, who had previously interviewed Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> and claimed knowledge of criminal activities by Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot.</b> Aruban investigators used information gathered from the extortion case to launch a new search at a beach, but no new evidence was found. Dave Holloway returned to Aruba on June 14 to pursue possible new clues.|$|E
50|$|An autopsy {{ruled that}} Flores {{did not have}} sexual {{intercourse}} before her death {{and that she was}} not under the influence of enough alcohol to prevent her from resisting an attack. She suffered blunt force trauma to her head, which caused a brain hemorrhage, cranial fracture, and broken neck. She also suffered significant injuries to her face and showed signs of asphyxiation, according to court documents. Flores tested positive for the presence of amphetamines. The lab report does not indicate whether the victim took the drugs willingly or unknowingly. The stains on Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> clothes matched Flores blood type. Blood was also found on the floor, hallway, and mattress in the hotel room. Police stated that DNA tests would be conducted on the clothes, skin found under the victim's fingernails, and the previously recovered tennis racquet. Ricardo Flores stated in interviews that his daughter's body needed to be exhumed to gather the fingernail DNA evidence, and that her body had not been cremated for this reason.|$|R
5|$|Following {{hearings}} {{before a}} judge, Deepak and Satish Kalpoe were released on Monday, July 4, but Van <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> was detained {{for an additional}} sixty days.|$|E
