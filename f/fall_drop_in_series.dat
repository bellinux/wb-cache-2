50|$|The <b>falls</b> <b>drops</b> <b>in</b> {{two major}} steps, split into an upper falls of 542 ft {{and a lower}} falls of 69 ft, with a gradual 9 foot (3 m) <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> {{elevation}} between the two, so the total height of the waterfall is conventionally given as 620 ft.

50|$|The <b>falls</b> <b>drops</b> <b>in</b> a {{straight}} plunge down approximately 100 ft to a steeply slanted protrusion of basalt which causes veiling of the cascade the remaining {{distance to the}} pool. Winter Creek, from which the waterfall is produced, only flows during the winter months, hence the name of both the stream and its cascade. Despite {{being one of the}} tallest waterfalls in the park, it is the one with the lowest flow volume. During the summer months, Winter Falls tends to be but a dribble of water spattering over the cliff of basalt.|$|R
5000|$|The Shasui <b>Falls</b> <b>drops</b> <b>in</b> three {{separate}} plunges {{with a total}} height of 90 meters. The upper falls has a height of 69 meters, the middle falls has a height of 16 meters and the lower has a height of 29 meters. The falls are mentioned as the Shasui Falls (...) in the Shin-Sagamikuni Fudoki of 1841, but have been known {{since at least the}} late Heian period. During the early Kamakura period, the famed monk Mongaku is said to have spent one hundred days in meditation and austerities at this waterfall, and the temple of Saishō-ji has an image of Fudo Myoo called the [...] "Waterfall Fudō", which it attributes to Mongaku.|$|R

40|$|There are two {{important}} differences between natural and artificial rainfall. While <b>drops</b> <b>in</b> natural rain have reached their terminal velocity, {{they are still}} in the phase of acceleration in the rain noise laboratory. The maximum number of drops per unit area and unit time in natural rain is at drop diameters around 2 mm, whereas artificial rain according to IS 0 140 consists mainly of 5 mm thick drops. It is shown that an accurate consideration of aerodynamic resistance is essential for properly modeling the motion of free <b>falling</b> <b>drops.</b> <b>In</b> particular, the dependence of the drag coefficient on the Reynolds number, e. g. on diameter and actual velocity, has to be included. The impact energy of a drop on a plate or membrane is calculated according to B. A. T. Petersson from the velocity and the shape of the drop. First estimates show a difference of 15 dB to the results obtained with the assumption of a constant drag coefficient. This might explain the difference between measured and calculated rain noise levels encountered in previous investigations...|$|R

The waterfall is located inside the Lake Chelan National Recreation Area in the North Cascades National Park, and is near Stehekin. The <b>falls</b> <b>drops</b> 392 ft <b>in</b> two tiers.

The river is thought to attain speeds of 60 km an hour and the chute is nearly 300 ft long. In high water, because of several potholes in the falls, water can sometimes shoot out as much as 30 feet.|$|R
25|$|The {{creeping}} flow {{results can}} be applied in order to study the settling of sediments near the ocean bottom and the <b>fall</b> of moisture <b>drops</b> <b>in</b> the atmosphere.

40|$|The {{formation}} of a vortex ring in a pool by contact with a fluid drop is a familiar phenomenon easily generated by milk <b>drops</b> <b>in</b> a glass of water. First observed over a century ago by Thomson and Newall (1885), however, much about the process is not well understood. For simplicity, {{much of the work}} done has been restricted to the case of the the drop and pool having identical composition. Chapman and Critchlow (1967) characterize the rings formed by <b>falling</b> <b>drops</b> <b>in</b> terms of the drop shape at the time of impact and propose a quantitative model of the vortex ring's generation process. Peck and Sigurdson (1994) analyze the structure of rings as they penetrate into the pool after a fall. Hsiao, et al. (1988) experimentally determine a critical Weber number for the <b>falling</b> <b>drop</b> (We ≈ 8) above which a jet, rather than a vortex ring, is formed in the pool. It {{should be noted that the}} Peck and Sigurdson drops had a We range of 22 - 25, which seems to contradict the earlier work of Hsiao, et al. To further simplify matters, the degenerate case (We = 0) in which contact between the drop and pool occurs with zero velocity may be examined. Shankar and Kumar (1995) observe the evolutionary behavior of rings so generated, and characterize the zero velocity case as a function of two dimensionless parameters only. In this work we visualize the {{formation of}} the ring rather than its evolution, and quantitatively examine a simplified scaling law based on the analyses of Hsiao, et. al and Shankar and Kumar. This scaling law, when valid, allows the flow conditions to be expressed in a single dimensionless parameter. Validity, however, requires that surface tension forces dominate gravitational and viscous ones in the vortex ring formation process...|$|R

40|$|A {{significant}} {{deviation from}} the Debye model of rotational diffusion in the dynamics of orientational degrees of freedom in an equimolar mixture of ellipsoids of revolution and spheres is found to begin at a temperature at which the average inherent structure energy of the system starts <b>falling</b> with <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> temperature. We argue that this onset temperature corresponds {{to the emergence of}} the α process as a distinct mode of orientational relaxation. Further, we find that the coupling between rotational and translational diffusion breaks down at a still lower temperature where a change occurs in the temperature dependence of the average inherent structure energy...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been made into the evaporation of large freely <b>falling,</b> oscillating water <b>drops</b> <b>in</b> an atmosphere composed entirely of its own vapour at varying pressures. Experiments were carried out at pressures of 2, 4, 5 and 6 x 10 (_ 5) N/m(^ 2). A photographic record was obtained of the drop at six observation points down the pressure vessel. From the drop diameter and the velocity of fall measured at the observation point the mass, Nusselt number, Reynolds number and coefficient of drag were calculated. With an increase in pressure the Nusselt numbers were found to increase and were much higher in value than those obtained by other investigators who had, however, used anchored <b>drops</b> <b>in</b> a moving atmosphere. Values obtained for small, freely <b>falling</b> <b>drops</b> were not comparable with the large <b>drops</b> investigated <b>in</b> this study due to the difference in dynamics of the larger <b>drop</b> <b>falling</b> within a pressurised atmosphere composed entirely of its own superheated vapour.
