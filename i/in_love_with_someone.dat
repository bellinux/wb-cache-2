50|$|During {{her work}} as a fortune teller, she noticed the {{similarities}} between her customers wishes about their future: almost all wanted to have <b>someone</b> fall <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> them, that <b>someone</b> would die so that they might inherit, or that their spouses would die, so that they might marry someone else. Initially, she told her clients that their will would be true if it was also the will of God. Then, she started to recommend to her clients some action that would make their dreams come true. These actions were initially to visit the church of some particular saint; eventually, she started to sell amulets and recommend magical practices of various kinds. The bones of toads, teeth of moles, Spanish flies, iron filings, human blood and mummy, or the dust of human remains, were among the alleged ingredients of the love powders concocted by La Voisin.|$|R

Everybody in the family is looking for the amulet and enchanted necklace, given to them by a concerned fortune teller, that Yashodhara stole and is later gifted to Abha. Abha is still in labor and there is a few minutes before 5:00, when Abha is supposed to give birth. Priyanka possesses the necklace and reveals that Yashodhara stole it and sold it to the same jeweller who then sold it to Pratibha. Karan then goes to the river to dump the necklace, which is considered a good omen, but on his way there he gets into an accident, still managing to throw the necklace into the river with a few seconds to spare. Abha gives birth to a little girl after a difficult labour, and cries in sadness when Vasundara takes her baby cruelly.

She threatens to kill the baby unless they give her Swarn Bhawan. Vasundara comes back and hands the baby to Karan. She then causes Yashodhra to get hit by a truck, finally killing her.

500|$|Although *Emilia is {{explicitly}} female, Love purposely {{ensured that the}} protagonist's gender is never stated, as she {{wanted them to be}} a blank slate that the player would project themselves into, rather than a character that the player would control.

Unofficially, however, Love thought of the relationship as [...] "queer", both in respect to the player's gender and in respect to *Emilia as [...] "a confused adolescent falling <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> <b>someone</b> she's not supposed to"; Love has stated that this did not come across as strongly as she intended.

She also stated {{that she wanted to}} write a happy and euphoric song that represented the positive beginning of her relationships, since most of her tracks are about the decay of them. In an interview with MTV UK, the artist said, [...] "'Not On Drugs' is, like many of my songs so far, about love.

At {{the end of the day}} nothing is indestructible, no matter how high you might rise in the world you are still a human being." [...] Marc Schneider from Billboard described [...] "Masterpiece" [...] as a slowed-down, moody ballad that showcases strong execution of vocals from Madonna. He described the production as [...] "simple, direct and reminiscent of her sound in the 1990s". The lyrics were described as emotional, and was comparable to the film's love story, with the chorus as follows: [...] "And I'm right by your side, Like a thief in the night, I stand in front of a masterpiece.
