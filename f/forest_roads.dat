5|$|Psilocybe pelliculosa {{is found}} in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada, where it grows on the ground in groups or {{clusters}} along trails or <b>forest</b> <b>roads</b> in coniferous woods. A single collection has also been reported from Finland. The mushrooms contain the psychedelic compounds psilocybin and baeocystin, although at relatively low concentrations. Several mushroom species that are similar in appearance to P.pelliculosa can be distinguished by subtle differences {{in the form of the}} fruit body, or by microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|MT 87 {{begins at}} the MontanaIdaho state line, {{traveling}} through Raynolds Pass. The highway proceeds northward, intersecting a small road before entering rural areas within Gallatin National Forest. The route continues northeast, intersecting several <b>forest</b> <b>roads</b> before bending northwestward. The route intersects several small roads while it runs parallel to a small creek. It crosses over the Madison River after passing several small buildings. The highway continues northwestward to its northern terminus, an at-grade intersection with US 287. The highway is maintained by the Montana Department of Transportation (MDT). Part of {{the job of the}} MDT is to measure traffic along the highway. These counts are taken using a metric called annual average daily traffic (AADT). This is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles that travel along a portion of the highway. In 2011, the highway had an AADT count of 583 vehicles. No portion of the highway is listed as part of the National Highway System (NHS), a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|Suggested {{conservation}} {{work for}} the future includes habitat restoration and predator population control. A healthy balance of mature and young forests still exists on {{the southern end of}} Amami, so that area should be protected. Restricting logging would also help to keep more forest available for the rabbits to live in by leaving more forest standing, as well as disturbing the surrounding environment more. An end to the building of <b>forest</b> <b>roads</b> used for logging and travel would further protect the amami rabbit, as they cause population and habitat fragmentation, destroys their prime habitat and allows predators easier access to the middle of forests where a majority of the rabbit population exists. Controlling the populations of mongooses, feral dogs, and feral cats is another approach that could help bolster the rabbit population. Eradication of the mongooses and feral cats and dogs is needed, as well as better control of pets by local island residents.|$|E

40|$|The {{specific}} way {{in which}} a <b>forest</b> <b>road</b> is designed affects the management in the forest environment and timber transport. The aim {{of this study was to}} find out whether an inclusion of the ecological criterion in the <b>forest</b> <b>road</b> design will change the parameter of the longitudinal gradient of <b>forest</b> hauling <b>roads</b> and whether these changes will have an effect on the accessibility of forest stands by timber hauling machinery. The possible changes in the longitudinal gradient can also affect the technology of <b>forest</b> <b>road</b> surfacing and the selection of the appropriate surface type. We can state that an inclusion of the ecological criterion in the <b>forest</b> <b>road</b> network design will bring statistically significant changes in longitudinal gradients of <b>forest</b> hauling <b>roads.</b> The mean longitudinal gradient of the current <b>forest</b> <b>road</b> network is 2. 82 [*]% and the mean longitudinal gradient of the <b>forest</b> <b>road</b> network designed with inclusion of the ecological criterion is 4. 82 [*]%. The results show statistically significant changes in the longitudinal parameters of <b>forest</b> hauling <b>roads.</b> However, it will not bring a need for a change in construction technology, and will not affect the accessibility of forest stands by timber hauling machinery...|$|R

25|$|In 2010, Cluj County {{recorded}} a road network density of 0.4km of road/km2. This level places Cluj {{above the national}} average (0.33km of road/km2).

500|$|The {{extensive}} use of <b>forest</b> <b>roads</b> through conifer plantations has been another criticism: {{the authors of the}} Lonely Planet guidebook, Walking in Ireland, found, [...] "The Way's one shortcoming is the character of the walking [...] you'll become all too familiar with forest tracks and roads through conifer plantations [...] where they're surrounded by tall, dense forest they're not particularly interesting". Similarly, Paul Gosling, who walked the Way for The Independent, found that, [...] "While the long distance path is, on occasion, very attractive, {{it is not so much}} hazardous as unadventurous. [...] Over the next four and a half days, we lost our enthusiasm for conifers [...] The views were restricted and there was little sign of wildlife". In The Irish Times John G.
