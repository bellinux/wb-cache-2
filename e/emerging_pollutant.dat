40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} exists that <b>emerging</b> <b>pollutants</b> such as pharmaceuticals (PhACs) and endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) can be bioaccumulated by aquatic organisms. However, the relative role of trophic transfers in {{the acquisition of}} <b>emerging</b> <b>pollutants</b> by aquatic organisms remains largely unexplored. In freshwater ecosystems, wastewater treatment plants are {{a major source of}} PhACs and EDCs. Here we studied the entrance of <b>emerging</b> <b>pollutants</b> and their flow through riverine food webs in an effluent-influenced river. To this end we assembled a data set on the composition and concentrations of a broad spectrum of PhACs (25 compounds) and EDCs (12 compounds) in water, biofilm, and three aquatic macroinvertebrate taxa with different trophic positions and feeding strategies (Ancylus fluviatilis, Hydropsyche sp., Phagocata vitta). We tested for similarities in pollutant levels among these compartments, and we compared observed bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) to those predicted by a previously-developed empirical model based on octanol-water distribution coefficients (Dow). Despite a high variation in composition and levels of <b>emerging</b> <b>pollutants</b> across food web compartments, observed BAFs in Hydropsyche and Phagocata matched, on average, those already predicted. Three compounds (the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac, the lipid regulator gemfibrozil, and the flame retardant TBEP) were detected in water, biofilm and (at least) one macroinvertebrate taxa. TBEP was the only compound present in all taxa and showed magnification across trophic levels. This suggests that prey consumption may be, in some cases, a significant exposure route.

From X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses, the crystallinity of TiO 2 nanoparticles (NPs) seems to be affected by Fe 3 O 4, acting as nano-seeds to improve the tetragonal TiO 2 anatase structure with respect to the amorphous one. Photocatalytic activity data, i. e., the degradation of methylene blue and the Ofloxacin fluoroquinolone <b>emerging</b> <b>pollutant,</b> give evidence that the increased crystalline structure of the NPs, even if correlated to a reduced surface to mass ratio (with respect to commercial TiO 2 NPs), enhances the performance of this type of catalyst.

The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to isolate molybdenum-reducing bacterium with the ability to grow on phenolic compounds (phenol and catechol). The screening process was carried out on a microplate. The bacterium reduced molybdenum in the form of sodium molybdate to molybdenum blue (Mo-blue). The bacterium required a narrow pH range for optimal reduction of molybdenum, i. e. between pH 6. 3 and 6. 8, with temperature between 34 and 37 oC. Molybdate reduction to Mo-blue was best supported by glucose as the carbon source. However, both phenol and catechol could not support molybdate reduction. Other requirements for molybdate reduction included sodium molybdate concentrations between 15 and 30 mM, and phosphate concentration of 5. 0 mM. The bacterium exhibited a Mo-blue absorption spectrum with a shoulder at 700 nm and a maximum peak near the infrared region at 865 nm. The Mo-reducing bacterium was partially identified as Enterobacter sp. strain Saw- 2.

Among the emerging contaminants and pollutants this paper focuses on organic wastewater contaminants (OWCs) mainly released into the environment by domestic households, industry, hospitals and agriculture. This paper starts from the current regulatory framework and from the literature overview to explain how the missing conceptual model for OWCs could be developed. A full understanding of the mechanisms leading to the contamination and the evidence of the contamination must be the foundation of the conceptual model.

40|$|Selenium (Se) is {{suggested}} as an <b>emerging</b> <b>pollutant</b> in agricultural environment {{because of the}} increasing anthropogenic release of Se, which in turn results in phytotoxicity. The most common consequence of Se-induced toxicity in plants is oxidative injury, but how Se induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst remains unclear. In this work, histofluorescent staining was applied to monitor the dynamics of ROS and nitric oxide (NO) in the root of Brassica rapa under Se(IV) stress. Se(IV) -induced faster accumulation of NO than ROS. Both NO and ROS accumulation were positively correlated with Se(IV) -induced inhibition of root growth. The NO accumulation was nitrate reductase (NR) - and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) -dependent while ROS accumulation was NADPH oxidase-dependent. The removal of NO by NR inhibitor, NOS inhibitor, and NO scavenger could alleviate Se(IV) -induced expression of Br_Rbohs coding for NADPH oxidase and the following ROS accumulation in roots, which further resulted in the amelioration of Se(IV) -induced oxidative injury and growth inhibition. Thus, we proposed that the endogenous NO played a toxic role in B. rapa under Se(IV) stress by triggering ROS burst.

40|$|Water quality {{characteristics}} and <b>emerging</b> organic <b>pollutants</b> were sampled along the San Pedro–Guayllabamba–Esmeraldas River {{and its main}} water pollution streams {{in the summer of}} 2013. The annual flow rate of the stream is 22 000 Mm 3 y 1 and it collects the wastewater of Quito-Ecuador in the Andes and supplies drinking water to the city of Esmeraldas near the Pacific Ocean. The most persistent <b>emerging</b> <b>pollutants</b> were carbamazepine and acesulfame, which were found to be stable along the San Pedro–Guayllabamba–Esmeraldas River, whereas the concentration of most other organic <b>emerging</b> <b>pollutants,</b> such as caffeine, sulfamethoxazole, venlafaxine, O-desmethylvenlafaxine, and steroidal estrogens, was degraded to a large extent along the 300 km flow. The mass rate of the sum of cocaine and benzoylecgonine, its metabolite, was increased along the stream, which may be attributed to coca plantations and wild coca trees. This raises the possibility of using river monitoring as an indirect way to learn about changes in coca plantations in their watersheds. Several organic <b>emerging</b> <b>pollutants,</b> such as venlafaxine, carbamazepine, sulphamethoxazole, and benzoylecgonine, survived even the filtration treatment at the Esmeraldas drinking water system, though all except for benzoylecgonine are found below 20 ng L 1, and are therefore not likely to cause adverse health effects. The research provides a way to compare drug consumption in a major Latin American city (Quito) and shows that the consumption of most sampled drugs (carbamazepine, venlafaxine, O-desmethylvenlafaxine, sulphamethoxazole, ethinylestradiol) was below their average consumption level in Europe, Israel, and North America...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} {{human health}} issues {{resulting from the}} continuous consumption of drinking water containing low concentration levels of persistent <b>emerging</b> <b>pollutants</b> has raised some concerns. The presence of <b>emerging</b> <b>pollutants</b> in surface water bodies and ground-water in Canada together with absence of proper drinking water treatment processes in remote places has created {{the need for an}} effective and simple process for removal of <b>emerging</b> <b>pollutants</b> from drinking water. Low seasonal temperatures in regions such as Saskatchewan demand a removal process that is effective at temperatures lower than room temperature. Adsorption with granular activated carbon is a well-established and effective method for removal of organic compounds from drinking water. There are a large number of reports on removal of organic compounds by activated carbon in literature however, the effectiveness of adsorption of <b>emerging</b> <b>pollutants</b> with granular activated carbon is not clear. Effectiveness of ozone treatment for oxidation of <b>emerging</b> <b>pollutants</b> is reported in literature however, effectiveness of regeneration of adsorbents saturated with <b>emerging</b> <b>pollutants</b> with ozone has not been investigated extensively. In the present work, effectiveness of adsorption with granular activated carbon for removal of <b>emerging</b> <b>pollutants</b> is investigated. Three model compounds of Ibuprofen, 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and Bisphenol A reported at considerable concentration levels in Saskatchewan water bodies were selected as model compounds. Bituminous coal based and coconut shell based granular activated carbons with basic point of zero charge were selected as adsorbents. Isotherm adsorption of model compounds on adsorbents was conducted at 280, 288, and 296 K. The Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy of adsorption were calculated using isotherm model parameters. Nitric acid pre-treatment was applied to reduce the point of zero charge of adsorbents. Adsorption isotherms were conducted with the acid treated adsorbents. Adsorption removal of model compounds in tap water was studied. Effectiveness of regeneration of saturated adsorbents with ozone was investigated. In terms of quality of fit to the isotherm adsorption data, Langmuir model was better than Freundlich model indicating monolayer adsorption of model compounds in all experiments. Higher Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity (Qmax) of bituminous coal based adsorbent than coconut shell adsorbent for adsorption of model compounds was attributed to the higher porosity of bituminous coal based adsorbent. Adsorption of model compounds (i. e. IBP and BPA) present in molecular form in the pH condition of the experiments were more dependent on adsorbent surface functional groups e. g. carboxyl and carbonyl groups. The Qmax of adsorption of 2, 4 -D present in anionic form was proportional with the specific surface area of adsorbent. Adsorption at temperatures lower than room temperature was effective. Adsorbent with acidic point of zero charge was more effective in removal of model compounds than adsorbent with basic point of zero charge. Adsorption of BPA was higher in tap water in comparison to Millipore water due to the more neutral surface of adsorbent in tap water. Higher pH of tap water than Millipore water and the ionic interaction between the adsorbent and dissolved solids present in tap water caused the more neutral surface of adsorbent. Regeneration of adsorbents with ozone failed in restoration of adsorption capacity of adsorbents and excessive ozonation destroyed the pore structure of adsorbents...|$|R

In previous studies, <b>emerging</b> <b>pollutants</b> including diverse pharmaceuticals were found to exhibit significantly different ozonation reactivity. However, how the structural differences of <b>emerging</b> <b>pollutants</b> determine ozonation reactivity and mechanisms are still ambiguous. In this work, ozonation of dimethylaminophenazone (DMP) and acetylaminophenazone (AAA) with the same parent structure of phenazone but different substitution groups was investigated, in order to probe influencing mechanisms of structural differences on ozonation reactivity. Results show that DMP reacts with ozone and HO·≡ almost 2 and 1 order of magnitude faster than AAA, respectively. At pH 8, HO·≡ accelerates ozonation of DMP, but decreases ozonation of AAA. Competition simultaneously decreases degradation rate of the two phenazones, but effects on AAA are more significant than that on DMP. According to theoretical calculation results, differences in ozonation reactivity and mechanisms of the two phenazones can be mainly attributed to different substitution groups. The dimethylamino group in the structure of DMP increases the ozonation reactivity of phenazone by increasing reaction orbital energies and altering reaction sites, while the acetylamino group in the structure of AAA decreases the reaction orbital energy and therefore lowers the reactivity...|$|R

Oocytes degeneration and altered spermatogenesis were found in carp exposed to 2 mg/l, which gonads showed PFOA concentrations > LOD. The expression levels of aromatase gene (ARO), coding for the steroidogenic-key enzyme converting testosterone to estrogens, were altered in carp exposed at both concentrations: expression increased in testes and decreased in ovaries.

In an attempt to recommend a ‘risk-based’ remediation strategy, this study investigates the removal of PFOS from impacted waters and fixation of PFOS in impacted soils using a novel modified clay adsorbent (MatCARE™, patent number 2009905953). Batch adsorption tests demonstrated a much faster adsorption kinetics (only 60 min to reach equilibrium) and remarkably higher PFOS adsorption capacity (0. 09 mmol g− 1) of the MatCARE™ compared to a commercial activated carbon (0. 07 mmol g− 1). Treatability studies, performed by treating the PFOS-contaminated soils with the MatCARE™ (10 % w/w) and then incubating at 25 and 37 °C temperatures maintaining 60 % of the maximum water holding capacity of the soils for a period of a year, demonstrated a negligible release (water extractable) of the contaminant (only 0. 5 to 0. 6 %). The fixation of PFOS in soils by the new adsorbent was exothermic in nature. Soils with higher clay and organic matter content, but lower pH values, retained PFOS to a much greater extent. A cost analyses confirmed that the MatCARETM could be an economically viable option for the ‘risk-based’ remediation of PFOS in contaminated waters and soils. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of diclofenac (DCF) as an <b>emerging</b> <b>pollutant</b> in surface waters and drinking {{water has been}} attributed to elevated global consumption and the inability of sewage treatment plants to remove DCF. In this study, DCF spiked drinking water and river water was subjected to photolysis and TiO₂ photocatalytic treatments in a circulating laboratory-scale (immersion-well) and a demonstration-scale loop reactor (Laboclean). The operational parameters for the immersion-well reactor were optimised as follows: TiO₂ P 25 loading, 0. 1 g L⁻¹; natural pH, 6. 2; initial concentration, 30 mg L⁻¹; water type, distilled water. Complete DCF removal was realised within 15 min under the optimised conditions using the immersion-well reactor. Sunlight-mediated photochemical degradation required a prolonged exposure period of up to 360 min for complete DCF removal. DCF in distilled and drinking water was efficiently degraded in the larger Laboclean reactor. Differences were, however, observed based on their pseudo-first-order rate constants, which implies that the water matrix has an effect on the degradation rate. Six major photoproducts, 2 -(8 -chloro- 9 H-carbazol- 1 -yl) acetic acid, 2 -(8 -hydroxy- 9 H-carbazol- 1 -yl) acetic acid, 2, 6 -dichloro-N-o-tolylbenzenamine, 2 -(phenylamino) benzaldehyde, 1 -chloromethyl- 9 H-carbazole and 1 -methyl- 9 H-carbazole, generated from TiO₂ photocatalysis of DCF were identified by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LCMS) and Fourier transform–ion cyclotron resonance–mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS).

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. Emerging pollutants have been increasingly studied {{over the past decade}} to improve our understanding of their fate, occurrence and toxicological effects on the environment and human health. The aim of this research is to develop a model that calculates the removal of emerging pollutants in India using different treatment unit processes. Different wastewater treatment scenarios based in India were defined considering several variables and factors including: influent water quality, intended use of effluents, available resources, operational envelop and treatment efficiency of technologies. WiSDOM Tool was used to find optimal wastewater trains/packages for treatment keeping in view technical, environmental, social and economic aspects. The tool also evaluates the performance of each optimal solution in terms of removal of current pollutants (such as BOD, COD, TN, TP, FC etc.) using multi-objective genetic algorithms and multi-criteria decision analysis. An Excel spreadsheet model was developed, where the treatment trains (generated/selected by the WiSDOM tool) were passed through to determine the removal efficiency of emerging pollutants. Each <b>emerging</b> <b>pollutant</b> has different physical and chemical properties and therefore, each compound should be monitored separately to generate the optimum removal.

40|$|Selenium (Se) {{has been}} {{becoming}} an <b>emerging</b> <b>pollutant</b> causing severe phytotoxicity, which the biochemical mechanism is rarely known. Although hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) {{has been suggested}} as an important exogenous regulator modulating plant physiological adaptions in response to heavy metal stress, whether and how the endogenous H 2 S regulates Se-induce phytotoxicity remains unclear. In this work, a self-developed specific fluorescent probe (WSP- 1) was applied to track endogenous H 2 S in situ in the roots of Brassica rapa under Se(IV) stress. Se(IV) -induced root growth stunt was closely correlated with the inhibition of endogenous H 2 S generation in root tips. Se(IV) stress dampened the expression of most LCD and DCD homologues in the roots of B. rapa. By using various specific fluorescent probes for bio-imaging root tips in situ, {{we found that the}} increase in endogenous H 2 S by the application of H 2 S donor NaHS could significantly alleviate Se(IV) -induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) over-accumulation, oxidative impairment, and cell death in root tips, which further resulted in the recovery of root growth under Se(IV) stress. However, dampening the endogenous H 2 S could block the alleviated effect of NaHS on Se(IV) -induced phytotoxicity. Finally, the increase in endogenous H 2 S resulted in the enhancement of glutathione (GSH) in Se(IV) -treated roots, which may share the similar molecular mechanism for the dominant role of H 2 S in removing ROS by activating GSH biosynthesis in mammals. Altogether, these data provide the firs...|$|E
40|$|In the {{framework}} of the Micro-Ecological Life Support System Alternative (MELiSSA) project, a pilot study was performed to identify the effects of triclosan on the MELiSSA carbon-mineralizing microorganism Rhodospirillum rubrum S 1 H. Triclosan is a biocide that is commonly found in human excrement and is considered an <b>emerging</b> <b>pollutant</b> in wastewater and the environment. Chronic exposure to MELiSSA-relevant concentrations (≥ 25 μg liter− 1) of triclosan resulted in a significant extension of the lag phase of this organism but hardly affected the growth rate. Analytical determinations gave no indication of triclosan biodegradation during the growth experiment, and flow cytometric viability analyses revealed that triclosan is bacteriostatic and only slightly toxic to R. rubrum S 1 H. Using microarray analyses, the genetic mechanisms supporting the reversibility of triclosan-induced inhibition were scrutinized. An extremely triclosan-responsive cluster of four small adjacent genes was identified, for which there was up to 34 -fold induction with 25 μg liter− 1 triclosan. These four genes, for which the designation muf (micropollutant-upregulated factor) is proposed, appear to be unique to R. rubrum and are shown {{here for the first time}} to be involved in the response to stress. Moreover, numerous other systems that are associated with the proton motive force were shown to be responsive to triclosan, but they were never as highly upregulated as the muf genes. In response to triclosan, R. rubrum S 1 H induced transcription of the phage shock protein operon (pspABC), numerous efflux systems, cell envelope consolidation mechanisms, the oxidative stress response, beta-oxidation, and carbonic anhydrase, while there was downregulation of bacterial conjugation and carboxysome synthesis genes. The muf genes and three efflux-related genes showed the most potential to be low-dose biomarkers...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1970 s {{the impact}} of {{chemical}} pollution has focused almost exclusively on lists of conventional priority pollutants, especially those referred to as PBT (fulfilling criteria of Persistance, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity) or POPs (Persistent Organic Pollutants). The number of regulated, conventional pollutants, however, represents {{only a small part}} of the total number of potential pollutants. Emerging pollutants pose increasing threats to public health and ecosystems. Emerging pollutants are not necessarily new chemicals, and some of them have often long been present in the environment, but their presence and significance are only now being elucidated. How are emerging pollutants identified? How do emerging pollutants become regulated pollutants? What investigations should be undertaken when an <b>emerging</b> <b>pollutant</b> is identified? What are the substances that are being identified as emerging pollutants today, and what information is currently missing or required in terms of monitoring and assessment of their associated risks? Information on these substances is often difficult to obtain and the methods used are often at a research and development stage, or not appropriate for harmonisation at the European level. This makes comparison and interpretation of data very difficult, and represents a major difficulty for decision-making by the authorities. To discuss these issues from a wide perspective a workshop on ‘Emerging environmental pollutants: key issues and challenges’ was held in Stresa, Italy on 19 - 20 June 2006 as part of the activities of the EU-funded NORMAN project (Network of reference laboratories, research centres and related organisations for monitoring of emerging environmental pollutants). The workshop was organised with the collaboration of: 	INERIS - Institut National de l’Environnement Industriel et des Risques (France) 	JRC-IES – Joint Research Centre – Institute for Environment and Sustainability (EC) 	EA – Environment Agency for England and Wales (UK).

30|$|NORMAN {{provides}} a valuable and permanent network of research institutions, reference laboratories and stakeholders to support decision-makers in all {{decisions for the}} identification, monitoring, assessment and prioritisation of relevant <b>emerging</b> <b>pollutants.</b> While this concerns {{a large number of}} known but unregulated pollutants and significant data gaps, NORMAN also makes efforts to identify so far unknown chemicals with potentially adverse effects. In a typical environmental sample, represented by a gas or liquid chromatogramme, unknowns are still the majority and only joint efforts of the scientific community will help to change this situation. NORMAN and its WGs offer their expertise and facilities to organise and structure this process. Thus, joining this network and becoming actively involved in the multiple activities of its WGs is not only beneficial for the individual scientist, but also helps to solve the great challenges related to <b>emerging</b> <b>pollutants</b> at a local, national, European and global scale, and supports the integration of state-of-the-art science into regulation, monitoring and management of the environment.|$|R
40|$|<b>Emerging</b> <b>pollutants</b> {{are thought}} to be {{responsible}} for the most significant share of environmental, human health and economic risk. Although the universe of chemical pollutants is enormous, we only monitor and have studied a minor fraction. The study of the fate of the <b>emerging</b> <b>pollutants</b> and their transformation products in wastewater-treatment plants (WWTP) is of paramount importance, since it can provide valuable information on the human consumption of various drugs. Sewage epidiomiology is the new field that was develloped for the estimation of illicit drug use based on measurements of urinary excreted illicit drugs and their metabolites in untreated wastewater. Within this approach, human metabolic excretion products resulting from drug consumption are rapidly collected and pooled by the sewage systems, providing valuable evidence of the amount and type of drug consumed by a population. The main objective of this research is the contribution to the current knowledge on the actual burden of micropollutants on the environment and on the effect they have on the human health...|$|R
