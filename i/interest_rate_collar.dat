40|$|Banks play {{a pivotal}} role in the {{economic}} growth and development of countries, primarily through the diversification of risk for both themselves and other economic agents. <b>Interest</b> <b>rate</b> risk is {{regarded as one of the}} most prominent financial risks faced by a bank. A large portion of private banks’ revenue stems from net interest income that is generated from the difference between various assets and liabilities that are held on the balance sheet. Fluctuations in the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> can alter a bank’s interest income and value, making <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> risk management vital to its success. The asset and liability committee of a bank is the internal committee charged with the duty of managing the bank’s <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> risk exposure through the use of various hedging strategies and instruments. This thesis uses a case study methodology to analyse GBS Mutual Bank <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> risk management. Its specific business circumstances, balance sheet structure and the market conditions over a specified period are used to comment on the practicality of a variety of balance sheet positioning strategies and derivative hedging instruments. The thesis also provides recommendations for the bank’s asset and liability committee in terms of its functions and organisation. It is elucidated that the most practical balance sheet hedging strategies are a volume strategy and immunisation, while the most practical derivative hedging instruments are <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> futures and <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>collars.</b> It is found that the bank has a well functioning asset and liability committee whose only encumbrance to its functionality is the inadequacy of the informational technology used to measure, control and manage its <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> risk position. This thesis concludes by summarising the practicality of the various <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> risk hedging alternatives available to the GBS Mutual Bank. Implementing a particular strategy or instrument depends, of course, on its asset and liability committee’s decision...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} four essays on pricing fixed income derivatives and risk management. The first essay presents pricing and duration formulas for floating <b>rate</b> bonds and <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> swaps with embedded options. It combines Briys et al. 2 ̆ 7 s approximation with the extended Vasicek term structure model to value caps and floors. Using this approach, it computes the durations of caps, floors, <b>collars,</b> floating <b>rate</b> bonds with <b>collars</b> and <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> swaps with <b>collars,</b> and provides comparative statics analyses of these durations {{with respect to the}} underlying variables such as the cap rate, the floor <b>rate,</b> the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> volatility, and the level of <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> ^ The second essay explores a class of polynomial Taylor series expansions for approximating the bond return function, and examines its implication for managing <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> risk. The generalized duration vector models derived from alternative Taylor series expansion extend Fong and Fabozzi 2 ̆ 7 s M-square model and Nawalkha and Chambers 2 ̆ 7 M-vector model, and the empirical tests show that immunization results can be improved for models g(t) = tα with α less than 1 when higher order generalized duration vectors are used. ^ The third essay develops a methodology to build recombining trees for pricing American options on bonds under deterministic volatility HJM models. Without imposing the HJM drift restriction, our approach uses the Nelson-Ramaswamy transformation to generate recombining forward rate trees. We show that the option prices obtained from our recombining trees satisfy Merton 2 ̆ 7 s bond option PDE when step size approaches zero. Numerical simulations provide evidence that this approach is efficient in pricing both European and American contingent claims. ^ The fourth essay obtains computationally efficient trees for pricing European options under two types of proportional volatility HJM models. We construct a numeraire economy in which European options are priced using a maturity-specific equivalent martingale measure. We then show that for the two types of proportional volatility models, European option prices are independent of the forward rate drift under this maturity-specific equivalent martingale measure. Our method is particularly beneficial when used to price long-dated caps, floors and collars because these instruments involve a large number of long-dated puts and calls. ...|$|R

(3) The last question applied to both currency areas (old and potential new) is whether the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> gaps change over time.

Amongst the variables used in pricing these derivative products is the short-term <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> A numbers of short-term <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> models that are used to fit the short-term <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> exist.

50|$|To hedge {{costs on}} the sale of {{variable}} <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> bonds, which can rise and fall with the market, local governments, such as Baltimore, purchased <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> swaps which exchange a variable <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> for a fixed <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> In a swap deal, when the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> rises, the swap seller pays the local government the increased cost on the bond, while when the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> falls, the swap seller saves and pays the local government the decreased cost on the bond. The <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> swap mechanism generally works well, however, between 2007 and 2010 the payments to local governments on their swaps artificially decreased but the cost on their bonds remained at actual market rates.
