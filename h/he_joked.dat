5|$|Gimmick! {{initially}} garnered lackluster {{interest and}} mixed reviews from publications like Famitsu, Electronic Gaming Monthly, and Nintendomagasinet. This lack of popularity was blamed on casual players {{being unable to}} handle the difficulty, and the industry's transition to newer 16-bit consoles like the Super NES and Mega Drive. When Gimmick! was exhibited at places like the Tokyo Toy Show, Sakai recalled that he was hoping a dealer would see Gimmick! as a next-generation title developed for the original Nintendo and distribute it, only for them to lose interest once they learned it was an NES game. In retrospect, <b>he</b> <b>joked</b> that the game took 10 years for people to appreciate.|$|E
5|$|Voss, an avid motorcyclist, had {{a love of}} {{machinery}} {{that led him to}} consort with his enlisted mechanics, Karl Timms and Christian Rueser; he was even on a first name basis with them. In time, they would transfer squadrons to accompany him. Voss contravened uniform regulations at times and could often be found in the hangar working on his machine beside the mechanics, dressed in a grubby jacket without insignia. His care extended to his craft's exterior; he adorned his Albatros D.III with both a swastika and a heart for good luck. And although he was a casual dresser around his home airfield, when flying he would be well-dressed with a silk shirt beneath his aviation gear. <b>He</b> <b>joked</b> {{that he wanted to be}} presentable to the girls of Paris if he were captured; however, the shirt's silk collar protected his neck from chafing while he swivelled his head about watching for other aircraft during flight.|$|E
25|$|Teague was Vice President at {{the automaker}} from 1964 until {{he retired from}} AMC in 1983. At his retirement, <b>he</b> <b>joked</b> that the only Detroit auto company he had not worked for was Ford.|$|E

25|$|Johnson {{attended}} {{the launch of}} the World Islamic Economic Forum in London in July 2013, where he answered questions alongside Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. <b>He</b> <b>joked</b> that Malaysian women attended university in order to find husbands, causing some offence among female attendees.|$|E
25|$|Gibson casually disregards his {{reputation}} for intimidation, though, saying that he made no concerted effort to seem intimidating. <b>He</b> <b>joked</b> {{in an interview with}} a St. Louis public radio station that the only reason he made faces while pitching was because he needed glasses and could not see the catcher's signals.|$|E
25|$|On 26 July the {{official}} teaser for the brand was released, featuring Rouvas in a design room, approving designs and trying on the clothing. Rouvas discussed the {{label on the}} premiere of Vrady Me Ton Petro Kostopoulo on 6 October, where <b>he</b> <b>joked</b> that the reason why he decided to create {{it was because he}} had no more clothing as he is constantly ripping his at concerts. In October 2010, a television commercial for the line was released.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the debate}} was planned to focus on foreign policy and {{national}} security, Lehrer did devote {{the first half of}} the debate to the ongoing financial crisis. McCain repeatedly referred to his experience, drawing on stories from the past. Often, <b>he</b> <b>joked</b> of his age and at one point seemed to mock his opponent. Obama tied McCain to what he characterized as Bush Administration mistakes and repeatedly laid out detailed plans. Neither McCain nor Obama broke from talking points, and neither candidate made any major gaffe.|$|E
25|$|On 24 March 1917 Berthold {{resumed his}} victory string and was {{credited}} with four more victories by mid April. On 24 April he fiercely engaged a French Caudron R.9 until driven back to base by a bullet through his lower right shin. <b>He</b> <b>joked</b> in his diary that this minor wound left his right arm as his only unwounded limb. The shin wound caused him to be shipped from the hospital to convalesce at home from 23 May to 15 June. As an aftereffect, this wound added more chronic pain to his miseries. By now, his narcotics addiction was an open secret to his pilots.|$|E
25|$|Healy {{proved an}} able Governor-General, {{possessing}} {{a degree of}} political skill, deep political insight and contacts in Britain that the new Irish Government initially lacked, and had long recommended himself to the Catholic Hierarchy: all-round good credentials for this key symbolic and reconciling position at the centre of public life. <b>He</b> <b>joked</b> once that the government didn't advise him, he advised the government: a comment at a dinner for The Duke of York (the future King George VI) that led to public criticism. However, the waspish Healy still could not help courting further controversy, most notably in a public attack on the new Fianna Fáil and its leader, Éamon de Valera, which led to republican calls for his resignation.|$|E

25|$|The {{strain of}} {{carrying}} the Premiership and Foreign Office {{contributed to his}} second stroke at 10 Downing Street after dinner {{on the evening of}} 23 June 1953. Despite being partially paralysed down one side, he presided over a Cabinet meeting the next morning without anybody noticing his incapacity. Thereafter his condition deteriorated, and it was thought that he might not survive the weekend. Had Eden been fit, Churchill's premiership would most likely have been over. News of this was kept from the public and from Parliament, who were told that Churchill was suffering from exhaustion. He went to his country home, Chartwell, to recuperate, {{and by the end of}} June he astonished his doctors by being able, dripping with perspiration, to lift himself upright from his chair. <b>He</b> <b>joked</b> that news of his illness had chased the trial of the serial killer John Christie off the front pages.|$|E

500|$|Livingstone {{stood for}} the Labour {{candidacy}} as 2012 Mayoral candidate. His campaign attracted criticism when <b>he</b> <b>joked</b> {{that the election}} was [...] "a simple choice between good and evil", {{and when he was}} accused of anti-semitism by Jewish Labour supporters for suggesting that being largely wealthy, the Jewish community would not vote for him. He denied making the comments, but nevertheless apologised.|$|E
500|$|Stuart Morris, a {{historian}} who helped to provide research for Steel for the Portland show, commented: [...] "I {{was amazed that}} he should have absorbed so much of the island's history in the short period of time that he had. <b>He</b> <b>joked</b> about the Portland winds, saying that in comparison, islanders wouldn't even have bothered to take out their kites in the face of Hurricane Katrina. He made a few remarks about Portland/Weymouth rivalry and our Weymouth friends present laughed as much as the rest of us." ...|$|E

[...] "I hope the fans don't expect that much every night", <b>he</b> <b>joked.</b>|$|E

500|$|Kelly and {{his crew}} {{delivered}} the pressurized module for Kibo to the ISS. The module is the largest component of the Kibo laboratory and the station's largest habitable module. Discovery also delivered Kibo's Remote Manipulator System. Perhaps {{the most important part}} they delivered was a replacement part for the station's toilet. The single toilet on the ISS had been malfunctioning for a week, creating a potentially serious problem for the crew.

However, <b>he</b> <b>joked</b> that he was as surprised as the viewers to see Moriarty return, noting {{that it is impossible to}} fake shooting oneself in the head.

Moffat has commented that viewers will have to wait [...] "years" [...] to see the resolution of the cliffhanger.|$|E
500|$|Producer Frank Marshall {{played a}} {{pilot in the}} {{airplane}} fight sequence. The stunt team was ill, so he took the role instead.

Pat Roach plays the Nazi mechanic with whom Jones brawls in this sequence, {{as well as a}} massive sherpa who battles Jones in Marion's bar. He had the rare opportunity to be killed twice in one film. Special-effects supervisor Dennis Muren made a cameo as a Nazi spy on the seaplane Jones takes from San Francisco to Manila.|$|E
