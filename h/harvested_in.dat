5|$|For cut flowers, bulbs {{larger than}} 12cm in size are preferred. To bloom in December, bulbs are <b>harvested</b> <b>in</b> June to July, dried, stored {{for four days}} at 34°C, two weeks at 30 and two weeks at 17–20°C and then placed in cold storage for {{precooling}} at 9 degrees for about 15–16 weeks.

5|$|The short-finned {{pilot whale}} has also been hunted for many centuries, {{particularly}} by Japanese whalers. Between 1948 and 1980, hundreds of whales were exploited at Hokkaido and Sanriku {{in the north and}} Taiji, Izu, and Okinawa in the south. These fisheries were at their highest in the late 1940s and early 1950s; 2,326 {{short-finned pilot whale}}s were <b>harvested</b> <b>in</b> the mid- to late 1980s.

5|$|A lake {{restoration}} plan {{based on a}} decentralised bioreactor system to eliminate the organic load that enters the lake {{in the form of}} non-point and point source pollutants has also been mooted. Phumdis could be <b>harvested</b> <b>in</b> a sustainable manner by conversion into fuel and compost by installing ‘Plug Flow Bioreactors’ in a modular manner around the lake perimeter. Laboratory tests of key species of phumdis have proved its potential to produce biogas. The bioreactors could also be used to treat sewage and thus arrest flow of organic matter into the lake.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{large-scale}} Mesolithic nut processing, radiocarbon dated to circa 7000BC, {{has been found}} in a midden pit at Staosnaig on Colonsay. The dig discovered the remains {{of hundreds of thousands of}} burned hazelnut shells and gives an insight into communal activity and forward planning in the period. The nuts were <b>harvested</b> <b>in</b> a single year and pollen analysis suggests that the hazel trees were all cut down at the same time. The scale of the activity, unparalleled elsewhere in Scotland, and the lack of large game on the island, suggests the possibility that Colonsay contained a community with a largely vegetarian diet for the time they spent on the island.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{oilseed rape}} {{problems}} is pre-harvest and harvesting grain losses due to uneven maturation of the pods. This experiment {{was conducted in}} order to evaluate the losses of different harvesting methods. A split plot experiment based on randomized complete block design with three replications was used. The main plots concerning harvesting methods were as: windrowing in 35 % grain moisture content (M. C.) and <b>harvesting</b> <b>in</b> 10 % grain M. C., two stage <b>harvesting</b> <b>in</b> 15 % and 10 % grain M. C., <b>harvesting</b> <b>in</b> 15 % grain M. C. and <b>harvesting</b> <b>in</b> 10 % grain M. C. subplots concerning rapeseed varieties were: hyola 308, hyola 401 and R. G. S. 003. Grain losses rate was significant in both main plot and sub- plot and their interactive effects. The least and highest losses rate was in windrawing treatment (3. 8 %) and <b>harvesting</b> <b>in</b> 20 % grain M. C. (23. 2 %), respectively. <b>In</b> <b>harvesting</b> <b>in</b> 20 % grain M.

5|$|Former {{changes in}} sea levels have left {{continental}} shelves, shallow {{areas in the}} sea close to land. These nutrient-rich waters teem with life, which provide humans with substantial supplies of food—mainly fish, but also shellfish, mammals, and seaweed—which are both <b>harvested</b> <b>in</b> the wild and farmed. The most diverse areas surround great tropical coral reefs. Whaling in the deep sea was once common but whales' dwindling numbers prompted international conservation efforts and finally a moratorium on most commercial hunting. Oceanography has established that not all life is restricted to the sunlit surface waters: even under enormous depths and pressures, nutrients streaming from hydrothermal vents support their own unique ecosystem. Life may have started there and aquatic microbial mats are generally credited with the oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere; both plants and animals first evolved in the sea.|$|E
5|$|It can {{be served}} either as a {{composed}} salad or as a tossed salad. Freshly cooked or canned tuna may be used. For decades, there has been significant disagreement between traditionalists and innovators regarding which ingredients should {{and should not be}} included in a salade niçoise. According to traditionalists, it excludes cooked vegetables. The salad may include raw red peppers, shallots, artichoke hearts and other seasonal raw vegetables. Raw green beans <b>harvested</b> <b>in</b> the spring, when they are still young and crisp, may be included. However, cooked green beans and potatoes are commonly served in variations of salade niçoise that are popular around the world.|$|E
5|$|Many species forage {{for food}} in the canopy of trees, taking {{advantage}} of serotiny (the storage of a large supply of seed in cones or gumnuts by plant genera such as Eucalyptus, Banksia and Hakea), a natural feature of the Australian landscape in dryer regions. These woody fruiting bodies are inaccessible to many species and <b>harvested</b> <b>in</b> the main by parrots, cockatoos and rodents in more tropical regions. The larger cones can be opened by the large bills of cockatoos but are too strong for smaller animals. Many nuts and fruits lie {{on the end of}} small branches which are unable to support the weight of the foraging cockatoo, which instead bends the branch towards itself and holds it with its foot.|$|E

5|$|Onions may {{be grown}} from seed or from sets. Onion seeds are {{short-lived}} and fresh seeds germinate better. The seeds are sown thinly in shallow drills, thinning {{the plants in}} stages. In suitable climates, certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter {{in the ground and}} produce early crops the following year. Onion sets are produced by sowing seed thickly in early summer in poor soil and the small bulbs produced are <b>harvested</b> <b>in</b> the autumn. These bulbs are planted the following spring and grow into mature bulbs later in the year. Certain cultivars are used for this purpose and these may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} Korean rural folk traditions, {{the sport is}} {{regarded}} as a predictor of future events, specifically harvests. The outcome of a ritualised contest between the two sides of a village (East and West) was seen as an indicator of the abundance (or otherwise) of that year's rice crop, which would be <b>harvested</b> <b>in</b> the autumn; as a result, juldarigi and similar folk sports are predominant in the rice-growing areas of the South. This is due to the common association in Southeast Asia between dragons (which the ropes of the juldarigi are thought to resemble) and rain; as a result juldarigi or similar tug-of-war ceremonies have also historically been staged during periods of drought. The connection of the two ropes used (with one rope's smaller loop being placed through the other's larger loop) is reminiscent of sexual intercourse, which also gives rise to the sport's association with fecundity.|$|E
5|$|Terns {{and their}} eggs {{have long been}} eaten by humans and island colonies were raided by sailors on long voyages since the eggs or large chicks were an easily {{obtained}} source of protein. Eggs are still illegally <b>harvested</b> <b>in</b> southern Europe, and adults of wintering birds are taken as food in West Africa and South America. The roseate tern is significantly affected by this hunting, with adult survival 10% lower than would otherwise be expected. In the West Indies, the eggs of roseate and sooty terns {{are believed to be}} aphrodisiacs, and are disproportionately targeted by egg collectors. Tern skins and feathers have long been used for making items of clothing such as capes and hats, and this became a large-scale activity {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century when it became fashionable to use feathers in hatmaking. This trend started in Europe but soon spread to the Americas and Australia. White was the preferred colour, and sometimes wings or entire birds were used.|$|E

40|$|Predator-prey {{model is}} the first model to {{illustrate}} the interaction between predators and prey. It is a topic of great interest for many ecologists and mathematicians. This model assumes that the predator populations have negative effects on the prey populations. The generalized equation of this {{model is the}} response of the populations would be proportional to the product of their population densities. Prey population grows with limited by carrying capacity, K and it is called the logistic equation. Thus, in this research, there are four different cases are analyzed which are predator-prey model, predator-prey model with <b>harvesting</b> <b>in</b> prey, predator-prey model with <b>harvesting</b> <b>in</b> predator and predator-prey model with <b>harvesting</b> <b>in</b> both populations.
