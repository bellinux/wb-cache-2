In 2006, after traveling around the state and talking with citizens, and compiling their ideas, Rubio published the book. The National Journal called this book [...] "the centerpiece of Rubio’s early speakership". [...] About 24 of the [...] "ideas" [...] became law, while another 10 were partially enacted. Among the items from his 2006 book that became law were multiple-year car registrations, a requirement that high schools provide more vocational courses, and an expanded voucher-like school-choice program. [...] Rubio's defenders, and even some critics, point out that nationwide economic difficulties overlapped with much of Rubio's speakership, and so funding new legislative proposals became difficult.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Intentionally</b> <b>blank</b> pages can {{be useful}} in {{standardized}} tests such as the GCSE, Higher School Certificate, SAT, CAT, ACT, MCAT, and GRE. In these exams, there are often individual, timed sections in which test-takers are prohibited from proceeding to the next section until that section's time interval has passed and the examiner allows them to continue. Because all of these separate sections are printed consecutively in the examination booklet, it may be possible for a test-taker who has finished the section early to see through the page and read the problems in the next section. By placing <b>intentionally</b> <b>blank</b> pages between these sections, the test-taker is prevented from cheating in this way. By printing a notice on the page, such as [...] "this page has been intentionally left blank", test-takers will not be concerned that their test has been misprinted, especially as test instructions often instruct students to check for missing or blank pages and to report any defective test booklets to a proctor. These pages may also be useful as scratch paper.|$|E

5000|$|An <b>intentionally</b> <b>blank</b> page or vacat page (from Latin: vacare for [...] "being empty") is a {{page that}} is devoid of content {{and may be}} unexpected. Such pages may serve {{purposes}} ranging from place-holding to space-filling and content separation. Sometimes, these pages carry a notice such as [...] "This page is intentionally left blank." [...] Such notices typically appear in printed works, such as legal documents, manuals, and exam papers, in which the reader might otherwise suspect that the blank pages are due to a printing error and where missing pages might have serious consequences.|$|E
50|$|In {{books of}} sheet music, {{relatively}} short pieces {{of music that}} span two to four pages often need to be arranged so the number of page turns for the performer is minimized. For example, a three-page work (starting on the left-hand sheet) followed immediately by a two-page work involves one page turn during each work. If a blank page immediately followed the three-page work (on the right-hand sheet), the two-page work will span {{the left and right}} pages, alleviating the need for a page turn during the second work. <b>Intentionally</b> <b>blank</b> pages may also prevent a page turn during a difficult passage.|$|E
50|$|In digital documents, {{pages are}} {{intentionally}} left blank so that the document can be printed correctly in double-sided format, rather than have new chapters start {{on the backs of}} pages. <b>Intentionally</b> <b>blank</b> pages have also been used in documents distributed in ring binders. The intention is to leave room for expansion without breaking the document's page numbering. This allows updates to be made to a document while requiring minimal new pages, reducing printing costs. The only drawback is the increased time required by the reader to manually insert various newly updated pages into their correct locations in the document.|$|E

50|$|<b>Intentionally</b> <b>blank</b> {{pages are}} usually the result of {{printing}} conventions and techniques. Chapters conventionally start on an odd-numbered page (recto page); therefore, if the preceding chapter happens to have an odd number of pages, a blank page is inserted at the end. Book pages are often printed on large sheets because of technical and financial considerations. Thus, a group of 8, 16, or 32 consecutive pages will be printed on a single sheet {{in such a way}} that when the sheet is mechanically folded and cut, the pages will be in the correct order for binding. This is called an even working, and the group of pages is called a section or signature. Books printed in this manner will always have a number of pages that is a multiple of the number in such a signature, such as a multiple of 8, 16, or 32. As a result, these books will usually have pages left blank, unless by chance or editorial ingenuity the exact number of pages are printed.|$|E

This report summarizes the work that has been performed and the results of these efforts, and identifies common themes that have emerged. The most detailed information provided is of the research conducted at Sandia National Laboratories, sponsored by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
