5|$|In January, 2012, the Church of Scientology {{brought a}} lawsuit against Debbie Cook for {{defamation}} after she sent an <b>e-mail</b> <b>to</b> 3,000 Church members criticizing its fund-raising methods. The lawsuit against her was quickly settled without payment by any side on April 23, 2012 after Cook was permitted to testify for three hours regarding her description of conditions at the Hole.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they fail}} to win the competition, a YouTube video of their {{performance}} gains the band popularity at school. David Bowie (portraying himself) sees the video and sends an <b>e-mail</b> <b>to</b> Will, explaining that he is starting an indie music label and is interested in having the band {{as one of their}} first artists. Will is so excited and overwhelmed that he falls {{down in the middle of}} the school hallway (close to the same position as the front cover of Bowie's Lodger album). The last scene takes place during Charlotte's graduation ceremony where Will and Sa5m are confirmed as dating.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{high demand}} and limited {{availability}} of the reserved tickets, some people planned to offer their tickets for sale through ticket brokers, Internet auctions and classified listing services. Sales offers for tickets reached as high as $1,750 each for the reserved standing room section behind the Capitol Reflecting Pool, $5,500 each for the reserved standing room section {{in front of the}} Reflecting Pool and $20,000 each for the VIP section on the Capitol grounds. In one case, a former legislative aide to Representative Ted Poe was exposed by a prospective buyer after the former aide used Craigslist and <b>e‑mail</b> <b>to</b> offer five tickets to the buyer for $4,500.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2005, when Corzine was running in the New Jersey gubernatorial election, news first emerged of his {{relationship}} with Katz and the money she had received. Corzine was elected governor despite the scandal. In the fall of 2006, during an impasse in contract negotiations between the Corzine administration and the state's seven major state employee unions (including the CWA), Katz contacted the governor by phone and <b>e-mail</b> <b>to</b> lobby for a renewal of the negotiations. Their relationship and the financial settlement Katz received after their breakup led to allegations of many potential conflicts of interest in labor negotiations while Corzine was governor. A state ethics panel, acting on a complaint from Bogota mayor Steve Lonegan, ruled in May 2007 that Katz's contact with Corzine during negotiations did not violate the governor's code of conduct.|$|E
5|$|Marge is irritated when Homer's snoring (so loud, it can {{be heard}} {{throughout}} most of the city) keeps her up at night. She sees Dr. Hibbert about the problem, and asks about a surgery, but he says it is expensive and tells them to get out when Homer asks him to do it for free. Developing a sleep problem, she sleeps for a night with Patty and Selma, and hears on the news that her old boyfriend, Artie Ziff, is one of America's five richest people. She drunkenly dictates an <b>e-mail</b> <b>to</b> Artie to congratulate him on his appearance, but Patty and Selma doctor it to use sexual terms in an attempt to split up Marge and Homer, much to Marge's horror (for using the word sex on the Internet). Artie, who over the years seems to have developed a rather frightening obsession with Marge (his house is decorated with a large number of 'Marge' sculptures/paintings), flies in his helicopter to the Simpson house to see Marge.|$|E

25|$|The {{code that}} would become WebKit began in 1998 as the KDE HTML (KHTML) layout engine and KDE JavaScript (KJS) engine. The WebKit project was begun within Apple by Don Melton on June 25, 2001 as a fork of KHTML and KJS. Melton {{explained}} in an <b>e-mail</b> <b>to</b> KDE developers that KHTML and KJS allowed easier development than other available technologies {{by virtue of being}} small (fewer than 140,000 lines of code), cleanly designed and standards-compliant. KHTML and KJS were ported to OS X {{with the help of an}} adapter library and renamed WebCore and JavaScriptCore. JavaScriptCore was announced in an <b>e-mail</b> <b>to</b> a KDE mailing list in June 2002, alongside the first release of Apple's changes. WebCore was announced at the Macworld Expo in January 2003 by Apple CEO Steve Jobs with the release of the Safari web browser. JavaScriptCore was first included with Mac OS X v10.2 as a private framework which Apple used in their Sherlock application, while WebCore debuted with the first beta of Safari. Mac OS X v10.3 was the first major release of Apple's operating system to bundle WebKit, although it had already been bundled with a minor release of 10.2.|$|E

The company agreed to re-invest any money it received from Ethiopia back into the country. In 2003, Nestlé agreed to accept an offer of US $1.5 million, and donated the money to three active charities in Ethiopia: the Red Cross, Caritas, and UNHCR.|$|E

Hair subsequently revoked the offer said that he never considered retirement. The ICC announced that Hair would not be umpiring at the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy due to security concerns and on 4 November 2006, Hair was banned from officiating in international matches by the ICC following a two-day meeting. A leaked ICC report showed that before the Oval incident, Hair was ranked the second-best umpire overall and number one in decision-making.|$|E
