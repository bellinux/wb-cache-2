Based on a comprehensive dataset of potential CLE proxies retrieved from original financial reports of 32 Australasian banks (1980 – 2005), this article analyses properties and interactions of potential proxies through time. It is found that some commonly used proxies correlate rather poorly and bad debt provisioning is only partially matched by subsequent write-offs. Moreover, even <b>derecognitions</b> in the form of write-offs do not seem to be definite as up to 25 % of loans written-off are ultimately recovered.

5000|$|There {{are many}} reasons why the schism in Freemasonry occurred, and why it still persists. The first {{instance}} of <b>derecognition</b> occurred in the United States shortly after the American Civil War. In 1869, the Grand Orient de France (GODF) recognized a Masonic group in Louisiana which was not recognized by the Grand Lodge of Louisiana (GLL). This was seen by GLL as an invasion of its jurisdiction, and it withdrew its recognition of GODF. At the request of GLL, several other American Grand Lodges also withdrew recognition. There {{is some evidence that}} racial motivations may also have played a part in this <b>derecognition.</b> The GODF had recently passed a resolution stating that [...] "neither color, race, nor religion should disqualify a man for initiation" [...] and the Grand Lodge of Louisiana, at that time, strictly excluded blacks and those of mixed race. However, this initial split was not unanimous in the US. Many American Grand Lodges continued to recognize the GODF well into the 20th century.|$|E

It draws on 15 cases of union <b>derecognition</b> across a broad spread of employment, matched with comparable cases where recognition was retained. It is shown that in practice, the line between recognition and non-recognition was extremely blurred. A move towards more cooperative workplace arrangements, associated with a ‘partnership ’ model of industrial relations, was common to employers in both categories. As part of this process, the traditional distinction between negotiation and consultation was breaking down. Against this background, we argue that it is far from clear that the current legislative strategy, in focusing on statutory recognition, is the best way of promoting partnership at work...|$|E

40|$|Contemporary {{recognition}} {{theory has}} developed powerful tools for understanding {{a variety of}} social problems through the lens of misrecognition.

In particular, I would like to make the case for <b>derecognition</b> in some cases: <b>derecognition,</b> in particular, through the systematic deinstitutionalization or uncoupling of various reinforcing components of social institutions, components whose tight combination in one social institution has led to the misrecognition in the first place. I make the case through the example of recent United States debates over marriage, especially but not only with respect to gay marriage. I argue that the proper response to the misrecognition of sexual minorities embodied in exclusively heterosexual marriage codes is not affirmative recognition of lesbian and gay marriages, but rather the systematic <b>derecognition</b> of legal marriage as currently understood. I also argue that the systematic misrecognition of women that occurs under the contemporary institution of marriage would likewise best be addressed through legal uncoupling of heterogeneous social components embodied in the contemporary social institution of marriage...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{recent report}} {{issued by the}} US-based audit company Ernst & Young (2006) stated that, in 2005, 23 out of the 39 French CAC 40 index {{companies}} initiated assets transfers. More specifically, 6 companies operated as transferee while 32 as assignor. Those transactions were mainly concerned with securitization and credit factoring issues. Besides, in 69 % of the assets transfer cases, the companies did not derecognize the credit assets and {{only half of the}} listed firms under scrutiny provided additional disclosure regarding these operations. Similar observations can be made in other European continental countries (see Escaffre and Ramond, 2007; IFRIC, 2006 a). This result highlights the current heterogeneity around the accounting treatment related to financial asset <b>derecognition</b> under international accounting standards and more specifically under IAS 39. Although IAS 39 contends that a financial asset <b>derecognition</b> should imply the transfer of both its contractual rights and most of its inherent risks to a counterparty, it fails to provide any readily-applicable models or methodologies necessary to meet these two criteria. Adopting the perspective from a credit factoring transaction ruled by civil code-based provisions, this paper aims to shed into light the potential current ambiguity and technicality surrounding the IAS 39 day-to-day application. For doing so, it first presents the IAS 39 <b>derecognition</b> features and then through a simple setting-based example discuss the (de) recognition of a credit assets transfer under IFRS while underlining some institutional perspectives for future standard interpretations...|$|E

The project {{to revise the}} Conceptual Framework is ongoing. The Conceptual Framework sets out the basic concepts for financial reporting. This study will concern proposals regarding the definition, recognition and <b>derecognition</b> of liabilities. Various stakeholders {{have been given the}} opportunity to comment on these proposals through Comment Letters (CL) on a previously released Exposure Draft (ED) 2015. The {{purpose of this study is}} to account for the different interest groups' attitude towards the proposal for the definition, recognition and <b>derecognition</b> of liabilities in the IASBs’ Conceptual Framework. Furthermore, the purpose is to examine the underlying reasons why they have positive or negative attitude to the proposal. Finally, the purpose is to examine whether the need for information differs between the interest groups in terms of definition, recognition and <b>derecognition</b> in the IASBs’ Conceptual Framework. The contribution of the study is to contribute to a greater understanding of the subject, as well as to benefit the standard-setters and the future process for standard-setting. This is done by identifying the different stakeholders attitude towards the proposals and why. Since it is important that the interests of stakeholders will be taken into account in order for the Conceptual Framework to be widely accepted, the study's results will be a contribution to the continued development of the Conceptual Framework. The study is based on the CL submitted to the International Accounting Standards Board before October 26, 2015, which was the last date to leave a CL on ED 2015. The study has been limited to, include only CL from standard-setters, accounting professionals, banks, companies and academics. The study consists 125 CL. Then a document examination with an inductive approach has been made. The result of the study shows that a majority of stakeholders are in favor of the proposals regarding the definition, recognition and <b>derecognition</b> of liabilities. Banks are the only interest group who disagrees with the proposal, which may be because they are worried that the proposal opens up for the opportunity for companies to make an assessment of the accounting method they themselves should choose. However, all stakeholders want more guidance in the Conceptual Framework. Furthermore, it can be concluded that stakeholders wish for a more rule-based Conceptual Framework. Based on the results of the study, it can be noted that the project to revise the Conceptual Framework should continue as there are unclear principles that need clarification.

40|$|This paper reports {{results from}} a recent survey we {{conducted}} on the union status of over 650 firms {{in the private sector}} of the UK. Compared to earlier periods, the survey shows that since 1997 there has been a slight fall in <b>derecognition,</b> but a relatively large increase in union recognition. Almost 11 % of firms report experiencing some new recognition, whilst 7 % reported some <b>derecognition.</b> In the late 1980 s new recognitions among similar firms were much lower (3 % between 1985 to 1990 according to Gregg and Yates, 1991). In our survey, new recognitions were more prevalent in larger firms and in regions and industries where union membership was already high. New recognitions were less likely to have occurred in companies with higher wages, higher productivity and higher capital intensity. The ‘blip up ’ in new recognitions is consistent with the idea that the incoming Labour government had a positive effect on the ability of unions to gain recognition, either through the 1999 legislation or more indirectly through changing the political climate.

40|$|The paper {{analyzed}} some of {{the approaches}} whose application is eligible for the recording of lease contracts {{on the side of}} lessor so that this recording display as closely as possible the essence of the lease relationship {{and at the same time}} it would be symmetrical to the way of recording on the side of lessee resulting not from value of transferred physical assets but from the evaluated right to use this asset. Impacts of individual variants of approaches into the income statement and statement of financial position are analyzed. It turns out that apparently it is not possible to apply only one approach (as it is in the case of lessee), without gross distortion of the financial position of the lessor. Some of the options of <b>derecognition</b> approach truly shows the situation, especially in long-term leases and leases where the risks and rewards associated with the lease are transferred to the lessee, for the other leases it is recommended sometimes to use underecognition property from the assets of the lessor during the lease period, but rather report a liability to leave to lessee to use (performance obligations approach). Compared with the current method of recording an operating lease, this approach without taking into account the cost of maintenance leads to another course of reporting profits (rise in the early stages against the growth in the final stages), but also brings a more fundamental problem, and it is overvaluation of lessor’s assets. In addition, it is possible to doubt about the correctness to report such liability as an unconditional liability. The approach is also not consistent with the IASB and the FASB project that is devoted to the recognition of revenues. The possible way, according to author’s opinion, might be regulation of existing model of reporting operating lease or <b>derecognition</b> approach...|$|E
