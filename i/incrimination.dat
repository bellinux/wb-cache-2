25|$|An {{ideology}} of preserving family honor is deeply rooted is society {{and is not}} affected by high levels of education. Many women in Turkey are well educated but still {{are expected to be}} modest and sexually pure in order to preserve the honor of their families. If a family's honor is breached, it brings shame to the entire family. In such cases, traditionally the family would decide the fate of the female that brought shame. This might involve forcing the young woman into a shotgun wedding, while in extreme cases a young male in the family was given the duty to cleanse the family name through an honor killing. With recent changes to criminal law that removed reduced sentences for honor killings, females that brought shame to the family are sometimes forced to commit honor suicides by their families, especially in the predominantly Kurdish South-East regions, a region that greatly values traditions. Families who do not want their sons to face possible <b>incrimination</b> have encouraged their daughters to commit suicide. The number of female suicides over the years has increased greatly. Stories have surfaced revealing girls who are given tools with which to kill themselves such as rope to hang themselves, poisons to drink, or a gun to shoot themselves. Some murders have also been disguised as suicides in order to protect family members. Female family members {{are not the only ones}} that may be punished to preserve family honor.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the link between}} lipophobia and representations and experiences of obesity in Catalonia (Spain) from two points of view: that of the physicians and other health professionals who diagnose and treat obesity as an ill ness, and that of their patients, especially those between adolescence and early adulthood. The qualitative data demonstrate that the increasing social rejection of fat people can be traced not only to moralizing discourses on “excessive” food consumption or the commodification of slenderness and health, {{but also to the}} recent definition of obesity as a disease. The medicalization of fatness, far from helping to destigmatize obesity, is becoming a way of resignifying it in moral terms. While doctors’ and patients’ pers pectives diverge in some ways, they converge in others. In this text, I focus on the points of convergence arguing that biomedical understandings of obesity and overweight are characterized by a profound ambivalence. Young patients are regarded both as innocent victims of a permissive consumer society, and guilty of not following doctors’ orders. Although the family is held accountable for overweight or obesity in children, as young people become more independent, guilt is individualized and environmental causes are limited to inappropriate diet and insufficient exercise. Most narratives of young people with weight problems reflect similar ideas about the causes and the responsibility for obesity. Their acceptance of the basic premise that deviating from weight standards and rules for healthy eating are voluntary actions leads them to lose faith in themselves. The stigmatization of obesity thus becomes a vicious circle: the obese acceptance—even consider normal—the <b>incriminations</b> leveled at them, and blame themse lves for their situation and their inability to pre vent it. </p...|$|R
40|$|After a long {{historical}} development, {{the second}} half of the 20 th century has inaugurated the new, latest branch of the punitive law - international criminal law. By its legal nature and characteristics it is somewhere between the national criminal law and international public law, maintaining its peculiarity and independence. The basic and most important notion and institute of this branch of law is certainly the international criminal act. In the theory of law (domestic and foreign), there are several views on the notion and contents of the international criminal act. However, it can be concluded that this notion implies a socially dangerous, illegal act committed by the perpetrator and defined as a criminal act whose perpetrator is to be punished as prescribed by the law. Such a defined notion of the international criminal act includes its basic elements, and these are as follows: 1) the act of a man (including the act of an adult person that can be committed in three forms: acting, non-acting, failure to provide proper supervision, effect and casualty; 2) social danger; 3) unlawfulness; 4) definition of an act by rules, and 5) guilt of the perpetrator. There are two kinds of international criminal acts: international criminal acts in a narrow sense and international criminal acts in a broad sense. The most significant are certainly the international criminal acts in a narrow sense that are directed towards violation or endangering of the universal, general civilisation values - international law and humanity - what is actually the subject of protection from these criminal acts. Apart from the international criminal act, the theory of law also includes a foreign criminal act (any criminal act with a foreign element). By all this, these two notions coincide largely, but are also considerably different from each other. Apart from the general notion of the international criminal act, the theory of law also includes a special being or a special notion of the international criminal act by whose characteristics and specific forms and shapes of manifestation some international criminal acts or responsibility of their perpetrators actually differ from each other. As a matter of fact, all international legal documents in this field (and then national criminal legislation as well) deal with the whole system of various <b>incriminations</b> punished by various kinds and sorts of penalties (as basic sorts of criminal sanctions). The following documents deal with some international criminal acts in their specific forms and shapes of manifestation: The Statute of the International Military Tribunal (that served to reach the Nuremberg and then the Tokyo verdicts), the Law No. 10 of the Control Council for Germany, the Statute of the Hague Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia as well as the statutes of some other ad hoc tribunals such as: Tribunals for Rwanda, Eastern Timor and Sierra Leone, then the Statute of the Iraqi Special Tribunal and finally the Permanent International Criminal Court Statute (the so-called Rome Statute) ...|$|R

Not all {{actions taken}} towards the {{commitment}} of a crime contain a sufficient degree of social danger to justify a reaction with the strong means of criminal law. But at what stage of crime does criminal liability begin? Preparation? Attempt? This article intends to determine {{the point at which}} a behaviour turns from being inoffensive into being socially dangerous in the history of Russian criminal law, assuming that the social and political changes Russia experienced within the past 150 years could not have been without impact on it. As a matter of fact, the determination of the aforementioned „sufficient degree” of social danger widely depends on the aims a legislator strives for with its criminal laws. The more repressive the intent, the earlier liability begins. In criminal science objective and subjective approaches, as well as a set of unifying theories, intend to substantiate the minimal conditions of punishment for uncompleted crimes. Unlike the objective approach, requiring a real danger for the concrete object of crime, the more repressive subjective theory basically founds pre-completing liability on the pure intention of the subject of crime. Russian criminal law began considering the beginning of criminal responsibility in the mid 19 th century. The first criminal code of 1845, mainly influenced by the objective approach, did not fit the stoutly repressive interests of the empire’s regime. The 1864 modifications of the criminal code introduced a unifying approach, clearly dominated by subjective elements. Repression from then on would mainly depend on the criminal’s view on his behaviour (art. 115 criminal code of 1864), even if punishment for preparation of crime remained exceptional. Acts on criminal law by the Soviet government were to begin with unstructured, but repressive. Surprisingly, the first criminal codes did not strongly disagree with the empire’s traditions. The turning point towards complete arbitrariness is marked by the 1926 Criminal Code, which introduced a material concept of crime giving up „formal confinements” of tribunals. Soviet authors may have always pretended an objective background of the material approach founded on the subject’s social danger, but the repressive purposes and results clearly demonstrate its subjective nature. This is particularly clarified by the impact of the new code on the beginning of criminal liability. In order to amplify the society’s power of impact against crime (and subversion), the criminal code provided for regular liability of attempt and preparation of crime. It abandoned limitations stipulating that preparation shall be considered as any „creation of requirements for a crime”. It hence opened responsibility for any kind of real or alleged action, or even omission, and made preparation of crime (especially of counterrevolutionary acts) one of the main <b>incriminations</b> during Stalin’s repression period. Not abandoning the material concept, the 1960 and 1996 Criminal Codes sustained the written elements of offence, and criminal law became more reliable again. Nevertheless neither the criminal code of 1960, nor the criminal code of 1996 abolished liability for preparation of crime, even if the later one restricts liability to preparation of grave and eminently grave crimes. Regardless of the fact that current Russian legal literature does not actively discuss the foundation of criminal liability, it appears very clear that since 1864 all Russian legislators (as well as most in the world) mainly started from subjective concepts when fixing the beginning of criminal liability. Soviet criminal law was thus unable to emancipate from the traditional approaches and even amplified arbitrariness under the criminal code of 1926. Today, the most excessive consequences of arbitrariness are eased by objective frictions, shown for instance in an obligatory mitigation of punishment for attempt and preparation of crime...|$|R
