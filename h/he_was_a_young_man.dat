At the age of 12, {{he had his own}} library collection of 25 books, even though books were really expensive during that time. He would imitate the scholars by reading the books, and then give lectures {{to the rest of the}} village. If any women needed any information, they would wait till Syed Qutb came back from school, and ask him to share the knowledge he had to them.

2500|$|Clemens {{for all of}} {{his career}} was a prototypical power pitcher with an {{aggressive}} edge. This was especially the case when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man,</b> when Clemens [...] "threw two pitches: a 98-mph fastball and a hard breaking ball. At 23, Clemens simply reared back and threw the ball past batters." [...] Later in his career, Clemens developed a devastating split-finger fastball to use as an off-speed pitch in concert with his fastball. Clemens has jocularly referred to this pitch as [...] "Mr. Splitty." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rustin was {{a gay man}} who {{had been}} arrested {{throughout}} his early career for engaging in public sex with white male prostitutes. Rustin's sexuality, or at least his public criminal charge, was criticized by some fellow pacifists and civil-rights leaders because it detracted from his effectiveness. Rustin was attacked as a [...] "pervert" [...] or [...] "immoral influence" [...] by political opponents from segregationists to conservative black leaders from the 1950s through the 1970s. In addition, his pre-1941 Communist Party affiliation when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> was controversial, having caused scrutiny by the FBI. To avoid such attacks, Rustin served rarely as a public spokesperson. He usually acted as an influential adviser behind the scenes to civil-rights leaders. In the 1980s, he became a public advocate on behalf of gay and lesbian causes.|$|E
2500|$|Bosworth {{initially}} developed lung {{problems when}} he was 10 or 11 years old, shortly after his parents moved to University Place, Nebraska. [...] This occurred when he got overheated in a hot room helping with a friend's operation, {{then went to the}} cold outside and got a chill. [...] The lung problems continued for the next eight years, getting significantly worse when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> (age 18 or 19), when the doctors diagnosed tuberculosis and [...] said that he would soon die. [...] Bosworth then went from Nebraska to his parents' new home in Fitzgerald Georgia for a last visit and arrived in a near-death state. [...] While there he attended a religious meeting and was approached by an older Methodist [...] "Bible woman" [...] who [...] "used to walk the hills of Georgia and the Carolinas selling Bibles and preaching the gospel." [...] The account written by Bosworth's son in a later printing of [...] "Christ the Healer" [...] says: [...] "She prayed for him, he got up, and he was instantly healed." ...|$|E
