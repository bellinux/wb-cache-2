5000|$|The GSM {{specification}} {{requires the}} handset to authenticate to the network, {{but does not}} require the network to authenticate to the handset. This well-known security hole is exploited by an <b>IMSI</b> <b>catcher.</b> The <b>IMSI</b> <b>catcher</b> masquerades as a base station and logs the IMSI numbers of all the mobile stations in the area, as they attempt to attach to the IMSI-catcher. It allows forcing the mobile phone connected to it to use no call encryption (A5/0 mode) or to use easily breakable encryption (A5/1 or A5/2 mode), making the call data easy to intercept and convert to audio.|$|E
50|$|In the UK, {{the first}} public body to admit using <b>IMSI</b> <b>catchers</b> was the Scottish Prison Service, though {{it is likely that}} the Metropolitan Police Service has been using <b>IMSI</b> <b>catchers</b> since 2011 or before.|$|R
40|$|<b>IMSI</b> <b>catchers,</b> {{also known}} as fake base station threats, have {{recently}} become a real concern. There are currently a few freely available tools to detect such threats, {{most of which are}} Android apps that warn users when they are connected to the fake cellular base station. In this paper, we evaluate these Android apps and test how resistant they are against various attacking techniques. Such an evaluation is important for not only measuring the available defense against <b>IMSI</b> <b>catchers</b> attacks but also identifying gaps to build effective solutions. We developed White-Stingray, a systematic framework with various attacking capabilities in 2 G and 3 G networks, and used it for our study. Our results of five popular Android apps are worrisome: none of these apps are resistant to basic privacy identifier catching techniques. Based on our results, we identify limitation of these apps and propose remedies for improving the current state of <b>IMSI</b> <b>catchers</b> detection on mobile devices...|$|R
50|$|Due to the disproportionately large GSM {{mobile phone}} {{subscriber}} base in Nigeria {{and the use}} of cellphones as the principal means of communication by kidnappers and terrorists, the agency has had to develop telephone call intercept capability. <b>IMSI</b> number <b>catchers</b> and signal direction finders have been deployed for intercepting and tracking GSM and satellite phone communications.|$|R
50|$|Authentication and {{encryption}} both rely on {{a secret}} key, Ki, that is unique to the subscriber. Copies of Ki are held in the SIM and in the Authentication Center (AuC), {{a component of the}} HLR. Ki is never transmitted across Um.An important and well-known shortcoming of GSM security {{is that it does not}} provide a means for subscribers to authenticate the network. This oversight allows for false basestation attacks, such as those implemented in an <b>IMSI</b> <b>catcher.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{application}} Android IMSI-Catcher Detector (AIMSICD) {{is being}} developed to detect and circumvent IMSI-catchers, StingRay and silent SMS. Technology for a stationary network of IMSI-catcher detectors has also been developed. Several apps listed on the Google Play Store as <b>IMSI</b> <b>catcher</b> detector apps include SnoopSnitch, Cell Spy Catcher, and GSM Spy Finder and have between 100,000 and 500,000 app downloads each. However, these apps have limitations in {{that they do not}} have access to phone's underlying hardware and may offer only minimal protection.|$|E
5000|$|The {{attacker}} may try {{to break}} the encryption of the mobile network. The GSM network encryption algorithms belong {{to the family of}} algorithms called A5. Due to the policy of security through obscurity it has not been possible to openly test the robustness of these algorithms. There were originally two variants of the algorithm: A5/1 and A5/2 (stream ciphers), where the former was designed to be relatively strong, and the latter was designed to be weak on purpose to allow easy cryptanalysis and eavesdropping. ETSI forced some countries (typically outside Europe) to use A5/2. Since the encryption algorithm was made public, it was proved it was possible to break the encryption: A5/2 could be broken on the fly, and A5/1 in about 6 hours [...] In July 2007, the 3GPP approved a change request to prohibit the implementation of A5/2 in any new mobile phones, which means that it has been decommissioned and is no longer implemented in mobile phones. Stronger public algorithms {{have been added to the}} GSM standard, the A5/3 and A5/4 (Block ciphers), otherwise known as KASUMI or UEA1 published by the ETSI. If the network does not support A5/1, or any other A5 algorithm implemented by the phone, then the base station can specify A5/0 which is the null-algorithm, whereby the radio traffic is sent unencrypted. Even in case mobile phones are able to use 3G or 4G which have much stronger encryption than 2G GSM, the base station can downgrade the radio communication to 2G GSM and specify A5/0 (no encryption) [...] This is the basis for eavesdropping attacks on mobile radio networks using a fake base station commonly called an <b>IMSI</b> <b>catcher.</b>|$|E
40|$|Subscription {{privacy of}} a user {{has been a}} {{historical}} concern with all the previous generation mobile networks, namely, GSM, UMTS,and LTE. While a little improvement have been achieved in securing {{the privacy of the}} long-term identity of a subscriber, the so called <b>IMSI</b> <b>catchers</b> are still in existence even in the LTE and advanced LTE networks. Proposals have been published to tackle this problem in 5 G based on pseudonyms, and different public-key technologies. This paper looks into the problem of concealing long-term identity of a subscriber and presents a technique based on identity based encryption (IBE) to tackle it. The proposed solution can be extended to a mutual authentication and key agreement protocol between a serving network (SN) and a user equipment (UE). This mutual authentication and key agreement protocol does not need to connect with the home network (HN) on every run. A qualitative comparison of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} different techniques show that our solution is competitive for securing the long-term identity privacy of a user in the 5 G network...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in technology are posing new challenges for a legal system based on decades-old precedent. Nowhere is this more apparent than in law enforcement’s warrantless use of <b>IMSI</b> <b>Catchers.</b> These devices mimic a cell phone tower, and when the device is activated, cell phones will naturally connect to them. Law enforcement officers can use those intercepted cell phone signals to track a suspect’s movements in real time with startling accuracy. Scholarly commentary on these devices has largely concluded that their use requires a warrant. This Comment engages in a close examination of Fourth Amendment precedent and argues that, {{as much as we}} might wish otherwise, the use of these devices is justified under existing case law. The Fourth Amendment generally protects what a person seeks to keep private, but in a technologically connected world, the public has willingly traded privacy for convenience. Thus, if we are to maintain our privacy in an increasingly technological world, we might require either a rethinking of the precedent underpinning the Fourth Amendment or a proactive Legislature to step in and fill the gap that exists between an eighteenth century Amendment and a twenty-first century world...|$|R
40|$|The Long Term Evolution (LTE) is {{the latest}} mobile {{standard}} being implemented globally to provide connectivity and access to advanced services for personal mobile devices. Moreover, LTE networks {{are considered to be}} one of the main pillars for the deployment of Machine to Machine (M 2 M) communication systems and the spread of the Internet of Things (IoT). As an enabler for advanced communications services with a subscription count in the billions, security is of capital importance in LTE. Although legacy GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) networks are known for being insecure and vulnerable to rogue base stations, LTE is assumed to guarantee confidentiality and strong authentication. However, LTE networks are vulnerable to security threats that tamper availability, privacy and authentication. This manuscript, which summarizes and expands the results presented by the author at ShmooCon 2016 jover 2016 lte, investigates the insecurity rationale behind LTE protocol exploits and LTE rogue base stations based on the analysis of real LTE radio link captures from the production network. Implementation results are discussed from the actual deployment of LTE rogue base stations, <b>IMSI</b> <b>catchers</b> and exploits that can potentially block a mobile device. A previously unknown technique to potentially track the location of mobile devices as they move from cell to cell is also discussed, with mitigations being proposed.

40|$|Lately, from {{a secure}} system {{providing}} adequate user’s protection of confidentiality and privacy, the mobile communication has been degraded to be a less trustful one {{due to the}} revelation of IMSI catchers that enable mobile phone tapping. To fight against these illegal infringements {{there are a lot}} of activities aiming at detecting these IMSI catchers. However, so far the existing solutions are only device-based and intended for the users in their self-protection. This paper presents an innovative network-based <b>IMSI</b> <b>catcher</b> solution that makes use of machine learning techniques. After giving a brief description of the <b>IMSI</b> <b>catcher</b> the paper identifies the attributes of the <b>IMSI</b> <b>catcher</b> anomaly. The challenges that the proposed system has to surmount are also explained.

40|$|Today, we find {{wireless}} technology almost everywhere. Easily, we {{can communicate with}} {{people on the other}} side of the world using our mobile phones. By June 2017, the global number of unique mobile subscribers is over 5 billion [29]. The fact that almost everyone carries a mobile device around combined with technological vulnerabilities, results in a delicate situation. Consequently, different parties with more or less legal intentions have performed attacks on the mobile technology. An <b>IMSI</b> <b>Catcher</b> is a popular device which utilises vulnerabilities in the networks. The MSISDN also known as the phone number, is used by many personal services and situations. Hence a mobile phone number can be considered to be personal information, and can be used to violate personal privacy. Interestingly, there is not yet made MSISDN Catchers. Consequently, this master thesis investigates the possibility of building an MSISDN Catcher. With the main focus on the 4 G LTE mobile network, the presence and security of the phone number in the architecture and relevant services were studied. Also, an open source <b>IMSI</b> <b>Catcher</b> was built based on the OpenAirInterface software and the USRP B 200 mini radio device. The <b>IMSI</b> <b>Catcher</b> was used in an experiment where the goal was to catch the IMEI identity of mobile phones camping near the base station. It was found that there is no easy way to build an MSISDN Catcher based on the principle of an <b>IMSI</b> <b>Catcher.</b> Also, the open source <b>IMSI</b> <b>Catcher</b> was not able to catch the IMEI identity. Hence, these results show that both the identities are well protected against well-established exploit strategies...|$|E
40|$|IMSI Catchers are {{tracking}} {{devices that}} break {{the privacy of}} the subscribers of mobile access networks, with disruptive effects to both the communication services and the trust and credibility of mobile network operators. Recently, we verified that <b>IMSI</b> <b>Catcher</b> attacks are really practical for the state-of-the-art 4 G/LTE mobile systems too. Our <b>IMSI</b> <b>Catcher</b> device acquires subscription identities (IMSIs) within an area or location within a few seconds of operation and then denies access of subscribers to the commercial network. Moreover, we demonstrate that these attack devices can be easily built and operated using readily available tools and equipment, and without any programming. We describe our experiments and procedures that are based on commercially available hardware and unmodified open source software...|$|E
40|$|Proposed by the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) as a {{standard}} for 3 G and 4 G mobile-network communications, the AKA protocol is meant to provide a mutually-authenticated key-exchange between clients and associated network servers. As a result AKA must guarantee the indistinguishability from random of the session keys (key-indistinguishability), as well as client- and server-impersonation resistance. A paramount requirement is also that of client privacy, which 3 GPP defines in terms of: user identity confidentiality, service untraceability, and location untraceability. Moreover, since servers are sometimes untrusted (in the case of roaming), the AKA protocol must also protect clients with respect to these third parties. Following the description of client-tracking attacks e. g. by using error messages or <b>IMSI</b> <b>catchers,</b> van den Broek et al. and respectively Arapinis et al. each proposed a new variant of AKA, addressing such problems. In this paper we use the approach of provable security to show that these variants still fail to guarantee the privacy of mobile clients. We propose an improvement of AKA, which retains most of its structure and respects practical necessities such as key-management, but which provably attains security with respect to servers and Man-in-the- Middle (MiM) adversaries. Moreover, {{it is impossible to}} link client sessions in the absence of client-corruptions. Finally, we prove that any variant of AKA retaining its mutual authentication specificities cannot achieve client-unlinkability in the presence of corruptions. In this sense, our proposed variant is optimal...|$|R
40|$|Due to fast {{technological}} development and our constant communication protection of communication privacy {{in every aspect}} of our (legal) life has become more important than ever before. Regarding protection of privacy in criminal procedure special emphasis should be given to the regulation of privacy in Slovenian Constitution and its interpretation in the case law of the Constitutional Court. This paper presents the definition of privacy and communication privacy in Slovenian constitutional law and exposes the main issues of communication privacy that have been discussed in the case law of the Constitutional Court in the last twenty years. Thereby the paper tries to show the general trend in the case law of Constitutional Court regarding the protection of communication privacy and to expose certain unsolved issues and unanswered challenges. Slovenian constitutional regulation of communication privacy is very protective, considering the broad definition of privacy and the strict conditions for encroachment of communication privacy. The case law of Slovenian Constitutional Court has also shown such trend, {{with the possible exception of}} the recent decision on a dynamic IP address. The importance of this decision is however significant, since it could be applicable to all forms of communication via internet, the prevailing form of communication nowadays. Certain challenges still lay ahead, such as the current proposal for the amendment of Criminal Procedure Act-M, which includes the use of <b>IMSI</b> <b>catchers</b> and numerous unanswered issues regarding data retention after the decisive annulment of its partial legal basis by the Constitutional Court...|$|R
40|$|Long-Term Evolution (LTE) is {{currently}} being deployed in vast {{areas of the world}} and is the latest implemented standard in mobile communication. The standard is considered to have significant improvements compared to its predecessors; however, several weaknesses exists. One of the deficiencies in LTE is that a big portion of the signaling messages is transmitted without protection. International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) Catchers and Paging Catchers exploit this weakness to perform several attacks against privacy in LTE, which disrupts the communication service and weakens the credibility of mobile operators. An <b>IMSI</b> <b>Catcher</b> is essentially a device masquerading itself as com- mercial Base Station (BS) used to track devices and break subscriber privacy. In this thesis, IMSI Catchers in LTE networks are studied. An LTE <b>IMSI</b> <b>Catcher</b> has been implemented using a Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) and the open source platform OpenAirInterface. By the help of IMSI Catchers, an attack against subscriber privacy was conducted. The attack efficiently acquires subscription identities (IMSIs) within a limited area and then redirects subscribers back to the commer- cial network. The attack has been carefully tested and successfully proven feasible. It was found that the IMSI acquisition process is very efficient, and several IMSIs were collected within a few seconds of operation. Additionally, Paging Catchers are studied in this thesis. A Paging Catcher is a tracking device used to perform attacks against subscriber privacy passively; however, unlike the <b>IMSI</b> <b>Catcher,</b> the Paging Catcher masquerades itself as a commercial User Equipment (UE). A Paging Catcher has been implemented using a USRP and the open source plat- form srsLTE. This thesis verifies that a Paging Catcher attack locates LTE devices within a limited area and breaks subscriber privacy. The attack illustrates that the Paging Catcher conveniently receives paging messages broadcasted by nearby BSs. The paging messages contain Tem- porary Mobile Subscriber Identities (TMSIs) which is mapped to social identities. The attack has successfully been proven feasible; however, the Paging Catcher is dependant of the smart paging feature to locate the subscriber precisely...|$|E
40|$|IMSI Catchers {{are used}} in mobile {{networks}} to identify and eavesdrop on phones. When, the number of vendors in-creased and prices dropped, the device became available to much larger audiences. Self-made devices based on open source software are available for about US $ 1, 500. In this paper, we identify and describe multiple methods of detecting artifacts in the mobile network produced by such devices. We present two independent novel implementations of an <b>IMSI</b> <b>Catcher</b> Catcher (ICC) to detect this threat against everyone’s privacy. The first one employs a network of stationary (sICC) measurement units installed in a geo-graphical area and constantly scanning all frequency bands for cell announcements and fingerprinting the cell network parameters. These rooftop-mounted devices can cover large areas. The second implementation is an app for standard consumer grade mobile phones (mICC), without the need to root or jailbreak them. Its core principle is based upon geographical network topology correlation, facilitating the ubiquitous built-in GPS receiver in today’s phones and a network cell capabilities fingerprinting technique. The latter works for {{the vicinity of the}} phone by first learning the cell landscape and than matching it against the learned data. We implemented and evaluated both solutions for digital self-defense and deployed several of the stationary units for a long term field-test. Finally, we describe how to detect recently published denial of service attacks. 1...|$|E
40|$|Though {{the mobile}} phone market has embraced 3 G and 4 G services, {{especially}} {{for the convenience of}} high speed Internet connectivity, the original cellular network system, GSM, is still available and covers most of the human population. One of its weaknesses is the relative simplicity of setting up a fake Base Transceiver Station (BTS), which can mount several attacks against Mobile Station (MS). One of them is to trick the MS into revealing International Mobile Subscriber Identity(IMSI), which uniquely identifies a mobile network user subscription. A breach of privacy. These devices have therefore become known as IMSI catchers. This thesis presents IMSI catchers, how they can operate in the GSM network, and what makes them most effective at their task. This information is then used to identify ways detecting IMSI catchers. Some of these identification methods are implemented in a piece of software that utilizes a Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) to pick up GSM signals. This <b>IMSI</b> <b>Catcher</b> Detector is then tested in a live GSM environment, and the results of this experiment are analyzed. One proposed way of detection is to gather information from many BTSs to form a "fingerprint" of what is normal operation. Deviation from this would be deemed suspicious. This method seems to have some viability. After analyzing the data from the experiment it was found that there was very little deviation in broadcast traffic of the BTSs detected in the area covered by the experiment...|$|E
