5|$|Acupuncture is {{no better}} than placebo, usual care, or sham {{acupuncture}} for nonspecific acute pain or sub-chronic pain. For those with chronic pain, it improves pain {{a little more than}} no treatment and about the same as medications, but it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> with disability. This pain benefit is only present right after treatment and not at follow-up. Acupuncture may be a reasonable method to try for those with chronic pain that does not respond to other treatments like conservative care and medications.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eight}} {{weeks leading up}} to her wedding, Susan avoids any contact with Katherine. Katherine begins to resent Susan, even {{threatening}} to pour tomato sauce on Susan's wedding dress. Mike is concerned for Katherine, but Susan is frustrated with her behavior. On the day of the wedding, Katherine demands that Susan apologize to her in public. Susan obliges, expressing her sorrow to Katherine during the wedding ceremony. Katherine tells Susan that the apology <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> mend their friendship.|$|E
5|$|Amira goes to Yusef for help, {{saying she}} needs him on her side, {{threatening}} to tell Zainab that Yusef {{bought her a}} plane ticket if he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> her get Syed back. She convinces Zainab to talk to Yusef, and when Yusef sees 15-year-old Ben Mitchell (Joshua Pascoe), who has recently come out as homosexual, running out of Christian's flat, he asks if Christian acted inappropriately. At first Ben says nothing happened but later Ben tells Yusef that Christian touched him, and they tell Ben's father, Phil. This {{turns out to be}} untrue, but leads to Christian leaving Syed and Walford.|$|E

5|$|The two thieves {{thwart the}} dacoits sent by Gabbar to extort the villagers. Soon afterwards, Gabbar and his goons attack Ramgarh during the festival of Holi. In a tough battle, Veeru and Jai are cornered. Thakur, {{although}} he has a gun within his reach, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> them. Veeru and Jai fight back and the bandits flee. The two are, however, upset at Thakur's inaction, and consider leaving the village. Thakur explains that Gabbar had killed nearly all of his family members, and cut off both his arms a few years earlier, {{which is why he}} could not use the gun. He had concealed the dismemberment by always wearing a shawl.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are also}} {{affected}} by societal expectations, such as notions about masculinity and sexual prowess. Men from some traditional backgrounds may feel performance pressure {{that emphasizes the}} ability to have erections and sexual intercourse. Men who have strong sexual desire but who {{are not able to}} perform sexually may be at increased risk for depression, particularly when they believe strongly in traditional masculine gender norms with sexual function as core to the male identity. Men who strongly believe in these traditional roles may feel sexually inadequate, unmanly, insecure, and less satisfied with life. Since sexual dysfunction has this negative impact on self-esteem, treatment of erectile dysfunction can have a psychological benefit even though it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> with physical sensation. SCI may necessitate reappraisal and rejection of assumptions about gender norms and sexual function in order to adjust healthily to the disability: those who are able to change the way they think about gender roles may have better life satisfaction and outcomes with rehabilitation. Counseling is helpful in this reassessment process.|$|E
25|$|Radio isotope scan using {{technetium}} (99mTc) exametazime-labeled leukocyte SPECT may {{be useful}} in assessing the extent of disease and response to treatment but has little value in diagnosis, as the scan <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> differentiating EG from other causes of inflammation.|$|E

25|$|Very few {{complete}} thelodont specimens are known; fewer {{still are}} preserved in three dimensions. This {{is due in}} part to the lack of an internal ossified (i.e. bony) skeleton; it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> that the scales are poorly, if at all, attached to one another, and that they readily detach from their owners upon death.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no known}} cure for {{achondroplasia}} {{even though the}} cause of the mutation in the growth factor receptor has been found. Although used by those without achondroplasia to aid in growth, human growth hormone <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> people with achondroplasia. However, if desired, the controversial surgery of limb-lengthening will lengthen the legs and arms of someone with achondroplasia.|$|E
25|$|In {{countries}} where doctors {{are unable to}} compel patients to take their treatment (e.g., the UK), some say that urine testing only results in unhelpful confrontations with patients and <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> increase compliance.

25|$|Critical habitat was {{designated}} for the subspecies in 1984, {{when it was}} first federally listed. Although its habitat is naturally fragmented, human disturbance <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> the situation. If the suitable habitat patches become too isolated, gene flow stops occurring, and the subspecies could be even more threatened. One conservation priority is to maintain habitat between marsh patches in order to promote gene flow and preserve genetic diversity.|$|E
25|$|Global wild {{fisheries}} {{are believed}} to have peaked and begun a decline, with valuable habitat such as estuaries in critical condition. The aquaculture or farming of piscivorous fish, like salmon, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> solve the problem because they need to be fed products from other fish. Studies have shown that salmon farming has major negative impacts on wild salmon, as well as the forage fish that need to be caught to feed them.|$|E
25|$|Prevention {{includes}} wearing {{sunglasses and}} not smoking. Early on the symptoms may be improved with glasses. If this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>help,</b> {{surgery to remove}} the cloudy lens {{and replace it with}} an artificial lens is the only effective treatment. Surgery is needed only if the cataracts are causing problems and generally results in an improved quality of life. Cataract surgery is not readily available in many countries, which is especially true for women, those living in rural areas, {{and those who do not}} know how to read.|$|E

25|$|Even {{the name}} Gentius or Genthius <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> {{to solve the}} problem since we have two Illyrian forms Genthius and Zanatis. If Gentius or Genthius derives from *ǵen- (be born) this is proof of a Centum language, but if the name Zanatis is {{similarly}} generated (or from *ǵen- know) than we have a Satem language. Another problem related to the name Gentius is that nowadays it cannot be stated surely if the initial /g/ of the sources was a palatovelar or a labiovelar.|$|E
25|$|No {{official}} {{attempts to}} create an orthography have been made, nevertheless there are countless short stories, poems and songs written in Erzgebirgisch. The Sächsischer Heimatverein guidelines to writing in Erzgebirgisch were established in 1937, but are by and large not respected {{by the majority of}} authors. This means that linguistic analysis of this dialect has to be done in a field work setting with native speakers. An additional threat to Erzgebirgisch is the popular misconception that Erzgebirgisch was a hillbilly variety of Saxonian, which <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> the conservation efforts.|$|E
25|$|Constant {{false alarm}} rate, {{a form of}} {{automatic}} gain control (AGC), is a method that relies on clutter returns far outnumbering echoes from targets of interest. The receiver's gain is automatically adjusted to maintain a constant level of overall visible clutter. While this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> detect targets masked by stronger surrounding clutter, it does help to distinguish strong target sources. In the past, radar AGC was electronically controlled and affected the gain of the entire radar receiver. As radars evolved, AGC became computer-software controlled and affected the gain with greater granularity in specific detection cells.|$|E
