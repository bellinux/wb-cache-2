In 1934 it was filled in and {{is now known as}} el-Ghazali Square. It is currently in mixed use for shops, as a car park, and as a transshipment point for refuse.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s {{and early}} 1980s, {{replacing}} parts became an increasing problem. Components were failing due to wear and age, but the companies responsible for manufacturing the parts <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> business {{during the previous}} twenty years, sometimes immediately after World War II ended. The carrier's engineers often resorted to making replacements from scratch.|$|E
5|$|A well-educated landowning aristocrat, Edwards {{deliberately}} cultivated {{the image}} of the natural leader. Thomas Ford writes that he continued to dress like an 18th-century gentleman long after such fashions <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> style, and that his public speaking was marked by showy eloquence. Edwards consciously positioned himself in the select class of men who dominated Kentucky and, later, Illinois politics. In 1803 in Russellville, Edwards married Elvira Lane, a relative from Maryland.|$|E

5|$|He re-invented the {{practice}} of stiff-arming his tacklers, which <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favor among running backs in the 1970s. At times, he used his high school experience as a long jumper to leap over his opponents, landing on {{his head in the}} end zone to gain a touchdown in a game against the Buffalo Bills. His running gait was somewhat unusual, as his knees were minimally bent, and the motion was largely powered from the hip. This may have given his knees, a football player's most vulnerable joints, some protection, although he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in 1983. He referred to this procedure as an 11,000-yard checkup.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{the team}} {{believed}} {{that they would be}} unable to use the Wolfenstein name due to trademark issues, and came up with multiple possible titles, only to discover that the original developer, Muse Software, <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> business several years earlier and let the trademark lapse, leaving them the option to use the name Wolfenstein 3D. The game concept met with immediate approval from Scott Miller of Apogee, who considered id Software his star developer, and he paid id a US$100,000 advance on the project. Mark Rein, who had been brought on a few months prior as id's probationary president, also sold the idea of doing a retail Wolfenstein project to FormGen, which had published id's December 1991 Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter, overcoming the publisher's concerns over Wolfensteins proposed content. This put id in the unique position of selling simultaneously to the shareware and retail markets.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool had the {{majority}} of the possession up to this point, with Dortmund content to counter-attack. The tactic worked as Dortmund took lead in the 61st minute. Sigfried Held passed to Lothar Emmerich on the left hand side of the pitch, Emmerich played a lofted pass to Held, who volleyed the ball into the goal to give Dortmund a 1–0 lead. Seven minutes later Liverpool were level. Peter Thompson ran down the left hand side of the pitch and passed to Roger Hunt who scored to level the match at 1–1. The linesman on the left hand side of the pitch signalled to the referee that the ball <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> play, yet the referee ignored him and allowed the goal to stand. There were few chances for either side {{until the end of the}} half when Liverpool had a chance to win the match, but Hunt's shot missed. With the scores still level at 1–1, the match went into extra-time.|$|E

Umpire Aleem Dar changed the ball midway through Sri Lanka's innings, but England coach Ashley Giles denied the accusations, saying that Dar changed the ball because it <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> shape.|$|E
25|$|Though the C90 was {{superseded}} by the O-200, {{and many of}} the designs utilizing the O-200 <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> production by 1980, with the 2004 publication of the United States Federal Aviation Administration light-sport aircraft regulations came a resurgence in demand for the O-200. The light-sport aircraft standard is for small, simple single- and two-seat aircraft for which the O-200 is well-suited.|$|E
25|$|For {{a number}} of years (both before and during the Inprise name) Borland {{suffered}} from serious financial losses and poor public image. When the name was changed to Inprise, many thought Borland <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> business. In March 1999, dBase was sold to KSoft, Inc. which was soon renamed to dBASE Inc. (In 2004 dBASE Inc. was renamed to DataBased Intelligence, Inc.).|$|E

25|$|The air <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Danish balloon, as {{they rolled}} over to Sarel Burger – one of Namibia's four players named Burger. Having elected to bat, Namibia made 230 for 9, while Danish spinner Bobby Chawla took three for 42. After an opening {{partnership}} of 49 between Baljit Singh and Frederik Klokker, Sarel Burger took five wickets for 23 runs, as the Danes crumbled to 127 all out.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, the {{original}} Baldwin diesels {{were beginning to}} suffer reliability problems, which was exacerbated {{by the fact that}} Baldwin <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> business some 10 years before and could no longer provide spare parts or maintenance. With the new powerplant being constructed at Beesley's Point ready to consume several 90 car coal trains per week the PRSL was in need of more powerful and more reliable locomotives and turned to industry-leader EMD to supply 10 new second generation diesel electric locomotives.|$|E
25|$|In 1992 Spectrum Aircraft of Surrey, British Columbia, the {{manufacturer}} of the Spectrum Beaver aircraft line, {{went out of business}} and the following year ASAP began making parts for the existing RX-28, RX-35 and RX-550 Beaver fleet. In 1996, after a similar development program to the Chinook Plus 2, ASAP introduced an improved two-seat Beaver, designated the RX-550 Plus. In 2000 ASAP introduced the Beaver SS (single seat) to replace the RX-28 and RX-35 single seat Beavers that <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> production with Spectrum's 1992 demise.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} of Mexico's colonial {{artists were}} Spanish-born {{who came to}} Mexico {{in the middle of}} their careers. This included mendicant friars, such as Fray Alonso López de Herrera. Later, most artists were born in Mexico, but trained in European techniques, often from imported engravings. This dependence on imported copies meant that Mexican works preserved styles after they <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> fashion in Europe. In the colonial period, artists worked in guilds, not independently. Each guild had its own rules, precepts, and mandates in technique—which did not encourage innovation.|$|E
25|$|The {{events that}} {{followed}} are less clear. Later that day, {{the decision to}} bring troops of the Transcaucasian Military District, then commanded by Col. Gen. Ivan Fedyuninsky, into the matter was made in Moscow. The predominantly Georgian units stationed in the area were not deployed because of suspected unreliability, however. The Soviet Interior Ministry officials reported that Tbilisi <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> control. They claimed that the demonstrators, {{many of whom were}} allegedly drunk and armed, were pillaging the city, contemplated the pogroms of ethnic Russians and Armenians, and planned to seize the government buildings.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{no changes}} {{were made to the}} text, it was {{basically}} a remake of the 5th with very minor updates. All in all, the fourth, fifth, and sixth editions are virtually the same as each other. Rather than revising the main text of the encyclopedia with each edition, Constable chose to add all updates to the supplement. It's probable that the 6th edition only exists because of the need to remove the long s, which <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> style, from the font, which required the whole encyclopedia to be re-typeset.|$|E

25|$|Mein Kampf {{has been}} reprinted several times since 1945; in 1970, 1992, 2002 and 2010. In 1992 the Government of Bavaria {{tried to stop}} the {{publication}} of the book, and the case went to the Supreme Court of Sweden which ruled in favour of the publisher, stating that the book is protected by copyright, but that the copyright holder is unidentified (and not the State of Bavaria) and that the original Swedish publisher from 1934 <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> business. It therefore refused the Government of Bavaria's claim.|$|E
25|$|But {{that was}} as good as it got. Rangana Herath made 24 in a little over ten overs, before being {{dismissed}} by Lawson, Vaas paired up with Muralitharan for a partnership of 66, as both players played one of their most mature innings of their careers – Vaas made 49 and Muralitharan 36, and Sri Lanka salvaged 227 all out, trailing by 58. But the fizz <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the West Indies. In 10.2 overs before bad light stopped play, Vaas took two wickets – both lbw – and Muralitharan one, and West Indies ended the day on 17 for 3.|$|E
25|$|By late 1962, {{the company}} was again in dire {{financial}} trouble. The Mk3 Grantura had been introduced later than expected, two of the home market distributors <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> business (Research Garage and David Buxton Ltd.), the Canadian government had imposed a 10% duty on cars imported from the United Kingdom, and the company discontinued its relationship with Dick Monnich, the US importer, because of his failure {{to pay for his}} orders. Factory workers were all laid off in October 1962, and Henry Moulds and Bernards Williams met with the company's creditors in December. TVR Cars Ltd. moved into receivership and much of its equipment, including body moulds, was moved to secure storage.|$|E
