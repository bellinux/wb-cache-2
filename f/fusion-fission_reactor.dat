The High Power laser Energy Research facility (HiPER) is a proposed experimental fusion device undergoing preliminary design for possible construction in the European Union to continue the development of laser-driven inertial confinement approach.

Using much smaller lasers than conventional designs, yet produces fusion power outputs of about the same magnitude would offer a much higher Q with a reduction in construction costs of about ten times.

Scenarios studied include systems with no additional passive safety features to systems with melting reflectors {{designed to increase}} emissivity after reaching a critical temperature. Results show that for fission power densities of 5 to 10 MW/m 3, none of the realistic variants investigated are completely passively safe; the critical time, defined as the time when either any structural part of the fusion-fission tokamak reaches melting point, or when the pebble fuel reaches 1873 K, ranges from 5. 5 to 80 hours. Additionally, it is illustrated that, fundamentally, the LOCA characteristics of pure fission pebble beds and fusion-fission pebble beds are different. Namely, the former depends on the pebble fuel’s large thermal capacity, along with external radiation and natural convective cooling for its passive safety, while the latter depends significantly more on the tokamak’s sizeable total internal heat capacity.

The work considers the plasma–beam mode of fusion neutrons generation for the tokamak conditions. It is implemented with a powerful heating by neutral beam of fast atoms. In these modes, the ratio Q of thermonuclear power to the power injection heating is the order of unity.

To justify the evaluations a special analysis was conducted to define influence of density and temperature profiles on the value of Q under the conditions close to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) operation mode. Using spatial zero-dimensional approach does not lead to an overestimation of the power gain factor Q. The relaxation time of the beam in a neutron source is much greater than the plasma energy confinement time.

40|$|A <b>fusion-fission</b> (hybrid) <b>reactor</b> is a {{combination}} of a fusion device and a subcritical fission reactor, where the fusion device acts as a neutron source and the power is mainly produced in the fission core. Hybrid reactors may be suitable for transmutation of transuranic isotopes in the spent nuclear fuel, due to the safety margin on criticality imposed by the subcritical fission core. The SFLM Hybrid project is a theoretical project that aims to point out the possibilities with steady-state mirror-based hybrid reactors. The quadrupolar magnetic mirror vacuum field is based on the Straight Field Line Mirror field and the central cell is 25 m long. A fission mantle surrounds the mirror cell. The fission to fusion power ratio is about 150 with keff = 0. 97, implying that almost all the produced energy comes from fission. Beyond each mirror end magnetic expanders are located, which increase the plasma receiving “divertor” area and provide tolerable heat load on wall materials. The plasma is heated with ion cyclotron radio frequency heating and the fission mantle is cooled using a liquid lead-bismuth eutectic. The device is self-sufficient in tritium, and does not seem to suffer from severe material problems. A remaining issue may be the plasma electron temperature, which need to reach about 500 eV for efficient power production.   In this doctoral thesis, theoretical work has been done with the magnetic coil system of such a device and also with the overall concept. A new coil type, the fishbone coil, suitable for single cell quadrupolar mirrors, has been invented. Two vacuum field coil sets with satisfying properties have been found, where the most recent coil set consists of fishbone coils. Finite ß effects on the magnetic field have been investigated, showing that the flux tube ellipticity increases with ß. The ellipticity of the vacuum field increases slightly with radius, but with finite ß it decreases with radius. The maximum flux surface radial extensions decrease with ß, which is an unexpected and beneficial result. A radial invariant has also been identified, and particle simulations have been made to emphasize that quadrupolar mirrors must be symmetric or confinement may be lost...|$|R
40|$|The <b>fusion-fission</b> hybrid <b>reactor</b> is a {{promising}} {{technology that is}} likely to assume more and more importance in the global energy scenario in the coming years. Although this kind of nuclear system dates back to the earliest times of the fusion projects (when it was recognized that using fusion neutrons to “support” nuclear fission fuel cycle could widely increase the exploitation of the fusion plants), it appears to receive relatively limited attention since the mid- 1980 s. Notwithstanding, hybrid fusion fission systems have been already studied for some decades, in the most prominent laboratories and a relatively large bibliography was produced. Obviously much more papers on this topic have been published in more recent years. The fusion-fission hybrid concept can use both the nuclear fusion and fission processes: in a typical application, neutrons from fusion reactions can be used to sustain the fission chain of a sub-critical system. This is the basis of the hybrid reactor concept: neutron generation is not produced just in neutron-induced fissions, but also as a “by-product” of the fusion reactions inside the nuclear fusion reactor “core” (i. e., respectively, the void chamber for MCF or the fuel particles for ICF). This method allows to have an intrinsically safe facility (with a higher efficiency than a fusion reactor itself and a harder neutron energy spectrum than a fission reactor) which could be suitable for nuclear waste transmutation, too. In the last years, many initiatives on nuclear waste transmutation were proposed {{in order to reduce the}} long-term radiotoxicity of the wastes by eliminating a high fraction of the TRU from the SNF before their final disposal. In this frame, as already anticipated, hybrid fusion-fission systems could have an additional degree of freedom because of the independent source: this means that the neutron spectrum can be (reasonably) tailored for the transmutation purposes. In the present study a special focus has been devoted to the transmutation of SNF from fission reactors loaded in a fusion system, operated under the hypothesis to take into account the behaviour of a planned “real” (i. e. pulsed) MCF (ITER-like) plant...|$|R
40|$|Two {{scenarios}} are typically envisioned for thorium fuel cycles: 'open' cycles based on irradiation of {sup 232 }Th and fission of {sup 233 }U in situ without reprocessing or 'closed' cycles based on irradiation of {sup 232 }Th followed by reprocessing, and recycling of {sup 233 }U either in situ or in critical fission reactors. This study evaluates a third option {{based on the}} possibility of breeding fissile material in a <b>fusion-fission</b> hybrid <b>reactor</b> and burning the same fuel in a critical reactor without any reprocessing or reconditioning. This fuel cycle requires the hybrid and the critical reactor to use the same fuel form. TRISO particles embedded in carbon pebbles were selected as the preferred form of fuel and an inertial laser fusion system featuring a subcritical blanket was combined with critical pebble bed reactors, either gas-cooled or liquid-salt-cooled. The hybrid reactor was modeled based on the earlier, hybrid version of the LLNL Laser Inertial Fusion Energy (LIFE 1) system, whereas the critical reactors were modeled according to the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) and the Pebble Bed Advanced High Temperature Reactor (PB-AHTR) design. An extensive neutronic analysis was carried out for both the hybrid and the fission reactors in order to track the fuel composition at each stage of the fuel cycle and ultimately determine the plant support ratio, which has been defined as the ratio between the thermal power generated in fission reactors and the fusion power required to breed the fissile fuel burnt in these fission reactors. It was found that the maximum attainable plant support ratio for a thorium fuel cycle that employs neither enrichment nor reprocessing is about 2. This requires tuning the neutron energy towards high energy for breeding and towards thermal energy for burning. A high fuel loading in the pebbles allows a faster spectrum in the hybrid blanket; mixing dummy carbon pebbles with fuel pebbles enables a softer spectrum in the critical reactors. This combination consumes about 20 % of the thorium initially loaded in the hybrid reactor ({approx} 200 GWd/tHM), partially during hybrid operation, but mostly during operation in the critical reactor. The plant support ratio is low compared to the one attainable using continuous fuel chemical reprocessing, which can yield a plant support ratio of about 20, but the resulting fuel cycle offers better proliferation resistance as fissile material is never separated from the other fuel components...|$|R
