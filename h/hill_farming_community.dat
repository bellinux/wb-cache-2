50|$|Ogmore Vale (Cwm Ogwr) is {{a village}} in the county borough of Bridgend, Wales on the River Ogmore. The village's main source of income came from coal mining. Up until the year 1865, the Ogmore valley was a quiet, isolated, rural <b>hill</b> <b>farming</b> <b>{{community}}</b> of less than ten farms and a few cottages. Today, along with Nantymoel and Price Town it makes up the community of Ogmore Valley.|$|E
50|$|In North Africa {{we look at}} {{the farming}} {{practices}} of the Egg on, a Nigerian <b>hill</b> <b>farming</b> <b>community.</b> The Egg on live in the Mada hills between Lafia and Akwanga. The hills lay between two rivers that Mada and Arikya. The altitude helps retain moisture on the hills due to early morning mists and fogs. The altitude also makes for earlier and longer crop cultivation. They practice bush fallow agriculture as well as mixed farming land management styles. They focus on growing yams, cassava, maize, beans, and African rice; much of what is produced is exported as a cash crop and is their primary source of cash income. The Egg on use a terraced agricultural system to maximize space on the hills. The goats that they raise are kept mostly for fertilizer used in farming. They are only killed on special occasions such as weddings. The Eggon use the diversity in their environment to maximize their production.|$|E

40|$|This project {{sought to}} {{document}} and describe {{a public health}} programme targeting young farmers from <b>hill</b> <b>farming</b> <b>communities</b> in England. Farmers are known to experience {{physical and mental health}} inequalities and have a higher mortality rate from suicide than the general population. Using a case study methodology and guided by Friere's empowerment model of health promotion, the project aimed to improve the self-esteem and self-efficacy of participants. Photography and interviews were used by participants to record their feelings and experiences of farming and convey them to a wider audience. Photographic artists supported the participants through the delivery of skills-based workshops. Participants (n = 100) acquired new skills and demonstrated increased self-confidence. A photographic collection was produced and exhibited across the UK including the House of Commons. Photography was successfully used to engage young people and enabled them to take their views {{to the heart of the}} government. Empowering young farmers may mitigate against future mental health problems in this vulnerable occupational group...|$|R

50|$|To {{the east}} of this ancient way from Mennock to Penpont the hills drop to a small glen which carries a minor road north from Penpont to Burnmouth on the River Nith. There are several places along this glen {{offering}} access into the Scaur hills.Drumlanrig castle, its grounds, and the many estate properties surrounding it lie on and around a low north/south carefully forested ridge between this glen {{and the west bank}} of the River Nith. There are several walking and cycling trails in these wood and river bank environs. This is good agricultural land and there are many minor roads through the low green <b>hills</b> serving the <b>farming</b> <b>community</b> in this most easterly part of the Scaur hills.|$|R
