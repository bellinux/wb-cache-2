2500|$|A knight {{offers to}} take a young woman {{to his home in}} the north and marry her, and {{suggests}} she takes [...] "some of your father's gold and some of your mother's fee"(Child F), as well as two horses (often white for her, <b>dapple-grey</b> for him) from her father's stables (where there are almost always [...] "thirty and three"). They ride, sometimes to the side of a river, or more often to the banks of the sea, where he tells her to dismount: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'One fourteen-hand <b>dapple-grey</b> rocking-horse, {{with pure}} green rockers and {{detachable}} tail, pair gashly glass eyes, complete set 'orrible grinnin' teeth, and two bloody-red nostrils which, {{protruding from the}} brown papers, produced the tout ensemble of a Ju-ju sacrifice in the Benin campaign. Do I make myself comprehensible?' ...|$|E
60|$|So the youth, well {{pleased with}} this, thanked them, {{and at once}} set off to the hill where the twelve mares were at pasture. When he got up there and found them, each mare had her foal, and {{by the side of}} {{one of them was a}} big <b>dapple-grey</b> foal as well, which was so sleek that it shone again.|$|E
6000|$|The {{instinct}} {{of catching}} the horse roused Stephen, {{and it was}} soon accomplished, for the steed was a plump, docile, city-bred palfrey, with <b>dapple-grey</b> flanks like well-stuffed satin pincushions, by no means resembling the shaggy Forest ponies of the boys' experience, but quite astray in the heath, and ready to come at the master's whistle, and call of [...] "Soh! Soh!--now Poppet!" [...] Stephen caught the bridle, and Ambrose helped the burgess into the saddle. [...] "Now, good boys," [...] he said, [...] "each of you lay {{a hand on my}} pommel. We can make good speed ere the rascals find out our scant numbers." ...|$|E
60|$|We were early risers at that time, and {{the whole}} brigade was usually under arms at the flush of dawn. One morning--it was the sixteenth of June--we had just formed up, and General Adams had ridden up to give some order to Colonel Reynell within a musket-length of where I stood, when {{suddenly}} they both stood staring along the Brussels road. None of us dared move our heads, but every eye in the regiment whisked round, and there we saw an officer with the cockade of a general's aide-de-camp thundering down the road as hard as a great <b>dapple-grey</b> horse could carry him. He bent his face over its mane and flogged at its neck with the slack of the bridle, as though he rode for very life.|$|E
60|$|The path to {{the right}} led through groves and past carp ponds for a mile or more, until I reached the line of trees which skirted the {{boundary}} wall. Not a living thing did I see upon my way, save a herd of fallow-deer, which scudded away like swift shadows through the shimmering moonshine. Looking back, the high turrets and gables of the Boteler wing stood out dark and threatening against the starlit sky. Having reached the seventh tree, I clambered along the projecting bough which shot over the park wall, and dropped down upon the other side, where I found my good old <b>dapple-grey</b> awaiting me in the charge of a groom. Springing to my saddle, I strapped my sword once more to my side, and galloped off {{as fast as the}} four willing feet could carry me on my return journey.|$|E
6000|$|Marsilius has {{now made}} his first {{movement}} towards the destruction of Orlando, by sending before him his vassal-king Blanchardin with his presents of wines and other luxuries. The temperate but courteous hero took them in good part, and distributed them as the traitor wished; and then Blanchardin, on pretence of going forward to salute Charlemagne at St. John Pied de Port, returned and put himself {{at the head of}} the second army, which was the post assigned him by his liege lord. The device on his flag was an [...] "Apollo" [...] on a field azure. King Falseron, whose son Orlando had slain in battle, headed the first army, the device of which was a black figure of the devil Belphegor on a <b>dapple-grey</b> field. The third army was under King Balugante, and had for ensign a Mahomet with golden wings in a field of red. Marsilius made a speech to them at night, in which he confessed his ill faith, but defended it on the ground of Charles's hatred of their religion, and of the example of [...] "Judith and Holofernes." [...] He said, that he had not come there to pay tribute, and sell his countrymen for slaves, but to make all Christendom pay tribute to them as conquerors; and he concluded by recommending to their good-will the son of his friend Gan, whom they would know by the vest he had sent him, and who was the only soul among the Christians they were to spare.|$|E
60|$|I would I {{could tell}} you the moving story of our cart and cart-horses; the latter are <b>dapple-grey,</b> about sixteen hands, and of {{enormous}} substance; the former {{was a kind of}} red and green shandrydan with a driving bench; plainly unfit to carry lumber or to face our road. (Remember that the last third of my road, about a mile, is all made out of a bridle-track by my boys--and my dollars.) It was supposed a white man had been found--an ex-German artilleryman--to drive this last; he proved incapable and drunken; the gallant Henry, who had never driven before, and knew nothing about horses--except the rats and weeds that flourish on the islands--volunteered; Moors accepted, proposing to follow and supervise: despatched his work and started after. No cart! he hurried on up the road--no cart. Transfer the scene to Vailima, where on a sudden, to Fanny and me, the cart appears, apparently at a hard gallop, some two hours before it was expected; Henry radiantly ruling chaos from the bench. It stopped: it was long before we had time to remark that the axle was twisted like the letter L. Our first care was the horses. There they stood, black with sweat, the sweat raining from them--literally raining--their heads down, their feet apart--and blood running thick from the nostrils of the mare. We got out Fanny's under-clothes--couldn't find anything else but our blankets--to rub them down, and in about half an hour we had the blessed satisfaction to see one after the other take a bite or two of grass. But it was a toucher; a little more and these steeds would have been foundered.|$|E

6000|$|On {{the left}} wing of the horse Virgil appeared, in shining armour, {{completely}} fitted to his body; he was mounted on a <b>dapple-grey</b> steed, the slowness of whose pace was an effect of the highest mettle and vigour. He cast {{his eye on the}} adverse wing, with a desire to find an object worthy of his valour, when behold upon a sorrel gelding of a monstrous size appeared a foe, issuing from among the thickest of the enemy's squadrons; but his speed was less than his noise; for his horse, old and lean, spent the dregs of his strength in a high trot, which, though it made slow advances, yet caused a loud clashing of his armour, terrible to hear. The two cavaliers had now approached within the throw of a lance, when the stranger desired a parley, and, lifting up the visor of his helmet, a face hardly appeared from within which, after a pause, was known for that of the renowned Dryden. The brave Ancient suddenly started, as one possessed with surprise and disappointment together; for the helmet was nine times too large for the head, which appeared situate far in the hinder part, even like the lady in a lobster, or like a mouse under a canopy of state, or like a shrivelled beau from within the penthouse of a modern periwig; and the voice was suited to the visage, sounding weak and remote. Dryden, in a long harangue, soothed up the good Ancient; called him father, and, by a large deduction of genealogies, made it plainly appear that they were nearly related. Then he humbly proposed an exchange of armour, as a lasting mark of hospitality between them. Virgil consented (for the goddess Diffidence came unseen, and cast a mist before his eyes), though his was of gold and cost a hundred beeves, the other's but of rusty iron. However, this glittering armour became the Modern yet worsen than his own. Then they agreed to exchange horses; but, {{when it came to the}} trial, Dryden was afraid and utterly unable to mount. [...] . Alter hiatus [...] . in MS. Lucan appeared upon a fiery horse of admirable shape, but headstrong, bearing the rider where he list over the field; he made a mighty slaughter among the enemy's horse; which destruction to stop, Blackmore, a famous Modern (but one of the mercenaries), strenuously opposed himself, and darted his javelin with a strong hand, which, falling short of its mark, struck deep in the earth. Then Lucan threw a lance; but AEsculapius came unseen and turned off the point. [...] "Brave Modern," [...] said Lucan, [...] "I perceive some god protects you, for never did my arm so deceive me before: but what mortal can contend with a god? Therefore, let us fight no longer, but present gifts to each other." [...] Lucan then bestowed on the Modern a pair of spurs, and Blackmore gave Lucan a bridle. [...] . Pauca desunt. [...] . [...] . Creech: but the goddess Dulness took a cloud, formed into the shape of Horace, armed and mounted, and placed in a flying posture before him. Glad was the cavalier to begin a combat with a flying foe, and pursued the image, threatening aloud; till at last it led him to the peaceful bower of his father, Ogleby, by whom he was disarmed and assigned to his repose.|$|E
