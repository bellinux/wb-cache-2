60|$|Thank you, dearest Mr. Kenyon; and I should (and shall) thank Miss Thomson too for caring {{to spend}} a thought on me after all the Parisian glories and rationalities which I sympathise with by many degrees nearer than you seem to do. We, in this England <b>here,</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> social barbarians, to my mind--that is, {{we know how to}} read and write and think, and even talk on occasion; but we carry the old rings in our noses, and are proud of the flowers pricked into our cuticles. By so much are they better than we on the Continent, I always think. Life has a thinner rind, and so a livelier sap.

6000|$|Dr. McCrie's review may be read, or {{at least}} may be found, in the fourth volume of his {{collected}} works (Blackwood, Edinburgh 1857). The critique amounts to about eighty-five thousand words. Since the [...] "Princesse de Cleves" [...] was reviewed in a book {{as long as the}} original, never was so lengthy a criticism. As Dr. McCrie's performance scarcely shares the popularity of [...] "Old Mortality," [...] a note on his ideas may not be superfluous, though space does not permit a complete statement of his many objections. The Doctor begins by remarks on novels in general, then descends to the earlier Waverley romances. [...] "The Antiquary" [...] he pronounces to be [...] "tame and fatiguing." [...] Acknowledging the merits of the others, he finds fault with [...] "the foolish lines" [...] (from Burns), [...] "which must have been foisted without the author's knowledge into the title page," [...] and he denounces the [...] "bad taste" [...] of the quotation from [...] "Don Quixote." [...] Burns and Cervantes had done no harm to Dr. McCrie, but his anger was aroused, and he, like the McCallum More as described by Andrew Fairservice, [...] "got up wi' an unto' bang, and garr'd them a' look about them." [...] The view of the Covenanters is [...] "false and distorted." [...] These worthies are not to be [...] "abused with profane wit or low buffoonery." [...] "Prayers were not read in the parish churches of Scotland" [...] at that time. As Episcopacy was restored when Charles II. returned [...] "upon the unanimous petition of the Scottish Parliament" [...] (Scott's Collected Works, vol. xix. p. 78) it is not unnatural for the general reader to suppose that prayers would be read by the curates. Dr. McCrie maintains that [...] "at the Restoration neither the one nor the other" [...] (neither the Scotch nor English Prayer Books) [...] "was imposed," [...] and that the Presbyterians repeatedly [...] "admitted they had no such grievance." [...] No doubt Dr. McCrie is correct. But Mr. James Guthrie, who was executed on June 1, 1661, said in his last speech, [...] "Oh that there were not many who study to build again what they did formerly unwarrantably destroy: I mean Prelacy and the Service Book, a mystery of iniquity that works amongst us, whose steps lead unto the house of the great Whore, Babylon, the mother of fornication," [...] and so forth. Either this mystery of iniquity, the Book of Common Prayer, [...] "was working amongst us," [...] or it was not. If it was not, of what did Mr. Guthrie complain? If it was [...] "working," [...] was read by certain curates, as by Burnet, afterwards Bishop of Salisbury, at Saltoun, Scott is not incorrect. He makes Morton, in danger of death, pray {{in the words of the}} Prayer Book, [...] "a circumstance which so enraged his murderers that they determined to precipitate his fate." [...] Dr. McCrie objects to this incident, which is merely borrowed, one may conjecture, from the death of Archbishop Sharpe. The assassins told the Archbishop that they would slay him. [...] "Hereupon he began to think of death. But (<b>here</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> the words of the person who related the story) behold! God did not give him the grace to pray to Him without the help of a book. But he pulled out of his pocket a small book, and began to read over some words to himself, which filled us with amazement and indignation." [...] So they fired their pistols into the old man, and then chopped him up with their swords, supposing that he had a charm against bullets! Dr. McCrie seems to have forgotten, or may have disbelieved the narrative telling how Sharpe's use of the Prayer Book, like Morton's, [...] "enraged" [...] his murderers. The incident does not occur in the story of the murder by Russell, one of the murderers, a document published in C. K. Sharpe's edition of Kirkton. It need not be true, but it may have suggested the prayer of Morton.|$|E
