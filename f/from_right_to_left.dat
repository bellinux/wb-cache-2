5|$|Hieroglyphic writing {{dates from}} c. 3000BC, and is {{composed}} of hundreds of symbols. A hieroglyph can represent a word, a sound, or a silent determinative; and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts. Hieroglyphs were a formal script, used on stone monuments and in tombs, that could be as detailed as individual works of art. In day-to-day writing, scribes used a cursive form of writing, called hieratic, which was quicker and easier. While formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction (though typically written <b>from</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>left),</b> hieratic was always written <b>from</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>left,</b> usually in horizontal rows. A new form of writing, Demotic, became the prevalent writing style, {{and it is this}} form of writing—along with formal hieroglyphs—that accompany the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone.|$|E
5|$|Most of Leonardo's {{writings}} are in mirror-image cursive. While secrecy {{is often}} suggested {{as the reason}} for this style of writing, it may have been more of a practical expediency. Since Leonardo wrote with his left hand, it was probably easier for him to write <b>from</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>left.</b>|$|E

5|$|Neuman and EUROSEC {{official}} Lise Hartman (Loni von Friedl) interrogate Ross, who {{denies that}} he aborted the mission. Shortly after, Kane dies from his injuries. Eventually, Ross concludes {{that he is}} not on Earth, but is on the unknown planet – a Counter-Earth that is a mirror image of his. Signs of this reversal include a clock whose hands move anticlockwise, a tape deck's reels that turn clockwise and an oscilloscope that scans <b>from</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>left.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 1932 edition gave equal {{prominence}} to {{the complete}} Hebrew text and its English translation, {{placing them in}} parallel columns, and conveyed authenticity and adherence to tradition by opening <b>from</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> {{in the manner of}} a Hebrew book. Instructions for conducting the Seder appeared on the English side only and references to biblical verses cited in the text were on the Hebrew side. The Haggadah presents only the text and directions for conducting the Seder, without exegesis.|$|E
5|$|The text of a New Kingdom Book of the Dead was {{typically}} written in cursive hieroglyphs, most often {{from left to}} right, but also sometimes <b>from</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>left.</b> The hieroglyphs were in columns, which were separated by black lines – a similar arrangement to that used when hieroglyphs were carved on tomb walls or monuments. Illustrations were put in frames above, below, or between the columns of text. The largest illustrations took up a full page of papyrus.|$|E

40|$|Cross-sectional echocardiography, {{combined}} with injections of contrast into peripheral arm veins, {{has been used}} to study 15 patients with atrial septal defects and 10 patients with an intact interatrial septum. Of 11 patients with ostium secundum or sinus venosus atrial septal defects and left-to-right shunts a defect could be visualised in all, and in eight some degree of transfer of contrast <b>from</b> <b>right</b> atrium <b>to</b> <b>left</b> atrium was seen. In three of four patients with a dominant right-to-left shunt a defect was seen and in all there was free transfer of contrast <b>from</b> <b>right</b> atrium <b>to</b> <b>left</b> atrium. Though there may be variable loss of echoes in the septal image in patients with an intact interatrial septum, in general no fixed defect is seen an there is no transfer of contrast <b>from</b> <b>right</b> atrium <b>to</b> <b>left</b> atrium. This is a potentially valuable technique in the assessment of patients in whom an atrial septal defect is suspected...|$|R

5|$|This {{phosphorylation}} {{reaction is}} an equilibrium, {{which can be}} shifted by altering the proton-motive force. In {{the absence of a}} proton-motive force, the ATP synthase reaction will run <b>from</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>left,</b> hydrolyzing ATP and pumping protons out of the matrix across the membrane. However, when the proton-motive force is high, the reaction is forced to run in the opposite direction; it proceeds from left to right, allowing protons to flow down their concentration gradient and turning ADP into ATP. Indeed, in the closely related vacuolar type H+-ATPases, the hydrolysis reaction is used to acidify cellular compartments, by pumping protons and hydrolysing ATP.|$|E
5|$|Marmalade Boy was {{licensed}} for an English language {{release in}} North America by Tokyopop. The individual chapters were serialized by the company's manga anthology, Smile, from December 2001 through April 2002. Tokyopop released the first collected {{volume of the}} series on April 23, 2002 and released new volumes monthly until the final volume was released on August 5, 2003. It {{was one of the}} first manga series that Tokyopop released in the original Japanese orientation, in which the book is read <b>from</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>left,</b> and with the original sound effects left in place. Tokyopop's volumes of the series are out of print. Shueisha refused to renew the company's license of the series after becoming part-owner of rival publisher Viz Media.|$|E

5|$|Soult posted {{four and}} {{one-half}} divisions along this ridge, one division in Orthez and one division in reserve. Unlike the other divisions which had two brigades, Harispe's division contained three brigades. His third brigade under Marie Auguste Paris was detached {{to the right}} flank. Going <b>from</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>left,</b> the ridge was held by the divisions of Taupin, Claude Pierre Rouget, Darmagnac and Foy. Rouget was in temporary command of Maransin's division. Harispe's remaining two brigades held Orthez while Villatte's division was in reserve north of Orthez. Honoré Charles Reille commanded Taupin, Rouget and Paris on the right flank, Jean Baptiste Drouet, comte d'Erlon led Darmagnac and Foy {{in the center and}} Bertrand Clausel supervised Harispe and Villatte on the left flank. Pierre Soult's cavalry was scattered. The 2nd Hussars and the 22nd Chasseurs-à-Cheval were near Pau and out of the battle. The 13th, 15th and 21st Chasseurs-à-Cheval were detached to Harispe, D'Erlon and Reille, respectively, while the 5th and 10th Chasseurs-à-Cheval were in reserve.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, 24 September 1917, a British patrol {{reached the}} crash site. Documents in Voss' pocket identified him. A military doctor cursorily examined the corpse. He noted three bullet wounds. One ranged slightly upward through the chest cavity <b>from</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>left,</b> consistent with Hoidge's angle of fire; {{it would have}} killed Voss {{in less than a}} minute. The other two gunshot wounds pierced Voss's abdomen from rear to front, coinciding with Rhys-Davids's firing angle. Werner Voss was buried like any other dead soldier near Plum Farm, laid in a shell crater without coffin or honors. His grave's location was recorded as Map Sheet 28, coordinates 24.C.8.3. The field grave would subsequently be lost trace of, through the turmoil of ongoing ground fighting.|$|E

As the acoustic guitar begins playing, Beyoncé's face comes into view. She stands with {{her blond hair}} draped just below her exposed shoulders. As she intently stares into the camera, her skin glistens as though it has been coated with a honey-like and glittery substance. Turning her head <b>from</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>left,</b> with her eyes fixed off-camera, Beyoncé starts belting out the first verse. As the chorus is reached, scenes of Beyoncé in a darkened room are shown. Additionally, she places her face delicately against dripping water, gently brushing it with her lips and palms. The scenery changes and Beyoncé {{is back in the}} darkened chamber, where she removes her dress.|$|E

5|$|After {{the winter}} campaign, Schérer placed the {{divisions}} in the positions where they would start the 1796 campaign. <b>From</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>left,</b> they were Masséna with two divisions on the coast, Augereau on the Bormida River, Sérurier on the Tanaro, Macquard at the Col de Tende and Garnier on the far left. On 27 March 1796 Bonaparte arrived to take command of the Army of Italy. At this date Sérurier was 53 years old with 40 years of military service. He applied to retire on a pension due to his age, health and wounds, but after meeting Bonaparte he decided to stay. Masséna later wrote that Bonaparte did not impress his generals at first. Then the new commander put on his hat and sharply questioned them; the generals went away believing {{that they had a}} true leader at last. Bonaparte's plan was to mass over 20,000 men under Masséna and Augereau near Carcare where the Austrian and Sardinian armies linked. Sérurier's division would join the others near Ceva as they moved west. His 9,448-strong division consisted of the 39th, 69th and 85th Line Infantry Demi-brigades.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September, IV Corps began {{operations}} {{designed to}} capture Bancourt Ridge {{and allow the}} advance to continue. Under the cover of an artillery barrage, the 42nd Division, New Zealand Division, and 5th Division, <b>from</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> respectively, would begin advancing at 4:55 am. As had frequently happened during the battle, the New Zealanders found themselves ahead of the flanking divisions. The New Zealand Rifle Brigade swiftly made {{the crest of the}} ridge, taking 70 prisoners. The 1st Infantry Brigade was a little slower; the 1st Wellington Battalion made the crest and consolidated itself there. The other battalion, 2nd Auckland, despite the assistance of two tanks, was unable to do the same. Operating on the extreme flank of the New Zealand Division's sector of the front, it suffered the most from the lack of progress of the 42nd Division and was unable hold its portion of the crest. That evening, the 2nd Infantry Brigade moved into the line, replacing both the New Zealand Rifle Brigade and 1st Infantry Brigade.|$|E
5|$|On the {{division}} right, Tabu-dong was in North Korean hands, {{on the left}} Waegwan was a no-man's land, {{and in the center}} strong North Korean forces were infiltrating southward from Hill 518. The 7th Cavalry Regiment in the center could no longer use the Waegwan-Tabu-dong lateral supply road behind it, and was in danger of being surrounded. After discussing a withdrawal plan with Walker, Gay on September 5 issued an order for a general withdrawal of the 1st Cavalry Division during the night to shorten the lines and to occupy a better defensive position. The movement was to progress <b>from</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> beginning with the 8th Cavalry Regiment, then the 7th Cavalry in the Hill 518 area, and finally the 5th Cavalry in the Waegwan area. This withdrawal caused the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, to give up a hill it had just attacked and captured near the Tabu-dong road on the approaches of the Walled City of Ka-san. In the 7th Cavalry sector the 1st, 3rd, and 2nd Battalions were to withdraw in that order, after the withdrawal of the 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry, on their right. The 2d Battalion, 5th Cavalry, on Hill 303 north of Waegwan was to cover the withdrawal of the 7th Cavalry and hold open the escape road.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} of the church has nineteen stained glass windows, three behind the altar and eight along {{each side of the}} church building. The windows behind the altar focus on St. Joseph and depict, <b>from</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>left,</b> the sojourn of the Holy Family in Egypt; the daily lives of the Holy Family; and the death of Joseph. Four of the sixteen windows {{on the sides of the}} church (those closest to the altar and those closest to the doors) depict lilies. The remaining twelve windows each depict a single saint, including Ignatius of Loyola, Stanislaus Kostka, and Saint Cecilia. Further ornamentation of the walls includes carvings depicting the fourteen Stations of the Cross as well as twelve triforiums holding paintings illustrating the Lord's Prayer, the Bread of Life Discourse, and praise to Christ and Mary. On top of the altar, at the eastern end of the church, is a tabernacle. The altar, imported from Germany in 1880, is decorated with statues of Abraham, Peter, Paul, and Melchizedek.|$|E
5|$|The main access {{route to}} Ollantaytambo runs along a narrow valley {{formed in the}} {{mountains}} by the Urubamba River, which connects the site with Machu Picchu {{to the west and}} with Pisaq and Cusco to the east. After his uprising, Manco Inca fortified the eastern approaches to fend off attacks from the former Inca capital, now under Spanish occupation. The first line of defense was a steep bank of terraces at Pachar, near the confluence of the Anta and Urubamba rivers. Behind it, the Incas channeled the Urubamba to make it cross the valley <b>from</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> and back thus forming two more lines backed by the fortifications of Choqana on the left bank and 'Inkapintay on the right bank. Past them, at the plain of Mascabamba, eleven high terraces closed the valley between the mountains and a deep canyon formed by the Urubamba. The only way to continue was through the gate of T'iyupunku, a thick defensive wall with two narrow doorways. In the event of these fortifications being overrun, the Temple Hill, a religious center surrounded by high terraces overlooking Ollantaytambo, provided a last line of defense.|$|E
