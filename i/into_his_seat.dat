5|$|While {{travelling}} {{on a train}} Abbe {{noticed an}} older man staring at him who then {{asked if he was}} a 5th Dan Judo. Abbe replied “Why yes, how did you know that?” “Because you have the build of a 5th Dan. So who are you?“ Kenshiro replied: “Everyone knows who I am, I am Kenshiro Abbe, Judo champion of all Japan! “ Yes, I can see that,“ the old man replied. The old man continued to talk to Kenshiro much to his annoyance as he wanted to get some sleep. Eventually, the old man put a finger in Kenshiro’s face, “You are so powerful, break my finger!” Kenshiro was only too happy to oblige. He took the finger, expecting to snap it like a twig, and wham! He found himself on the carriage floor under the full control of the old man. The old man allowed Kenshiro to get back <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat.</b> “Who are you?” Kenshiro Abbe asked. “I am Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido.” Kenshiro Abbe was astounded at the technique of the old man and requested that he become his student.|$|E
25|$|The {{incident}} {{resulted in}} the first fatality on a spacecraft in flight since the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003. The survival of pilot Peter Siebold also {{marks the first time}} in history that anyone has survived the destruction of a spacecraft during a flight when others on board have died. Investigators are trying to determine how Siebold managed to get out of the rocket plane and parachute to the ground from an altitude of roughly 50,000 feet, an altitude virtually devoid of oxygen. On November 7, Siebold told investigators that the aircraft broke up around him. He was still strapped <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat.</b> He released the straps and his parachute later deployed automatically. Siebold was not wearing a pressure suit during the flight.|$|E
500|$|Dupin's method {{emphasizes}} the importance of reading and the written word. The newspaper accounts pique his curiosity; he learns about orangutans from a written account by [...] "Cuvier" [...] — likely Georges Cuvier, the French zoologist. This method also engages the reader, who follows along by reading the clues himself. Poe also {{emphasizes the}} power of the spoken word. When Dupin asks the sailor for information about the murders, the sailor himself acts out a partial death: [...] "The sailor's face flushed up as if he were struggling with suffocation... the next moment he fell back <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat,</b> trembling violently, and with the countenance of death itself." ...|$|E
50|$|Craig Weatherhill {{wrote the}} Mermaid of Zennor <b>into</b> <b>his</b> novel <b>Seat</b> of Storms (Tabb House, 1997), {{giving her the}} name Azenor, as the {{previous}} tellings never name her.|$|R

60|$|Hamel walked thoughtfully back <b>into</b> <b>his</b> sitting-room. He <b>seated</b> {{himself before}} a spotless cloth and watched Hannah Cox spread out his well-cooked, cleanly-served meal.|$|R
500|$|When the Dick Nixon Special {{arrived in}} Bakersfield, California, that day, the candidate, still {{oblivious}} to the developing furor, made a speech promoting the Republican ticket, and backing local congressman Thomas H. Werdel. After the speech, Republican activist Keith McCormac showed Nixon the Post story, which had been picked up by United Press under the headline [...] "Nixon Scandal Fund". According to McCormac, the senator collapsed <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> in shock, and needed the help of Murray Chotiner, who was again Nixon's campaign manager, and Congressman Patrick J. Hillings (a Nixon confidant who had succeeded him in the House of Representatives) {{to return to his}} compartment.|$|E
2500|$|Before the flight, Denver and the {{mechanic}} {{had attempted to}} extend {{the reach of the}} handle, using a pair of Vise-Grip pliers. However, this did not solve the problem, and the pilot still could not reach the handle while strapped <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... 10 December 2004: Captain Miles Selby {{died in a}} midair {{collision}} {{during training}} near Mossbank, Saskatchewan while practising the co-loop manoeuvre. The other pilot, Captain Chuck Mallett, was thrown from his destroyed aircraft while still strapped <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat.</b> While tumbling towards the ground, {{he was able to}} unstrap, deploy his parachute and land with only minor injuries.|$|E
60|$|Plunkett {{collapsed}} <b>into</b> a <b>seat.</b> <b>His</b> eye {{had caught}} sight of the smoking apparatus on the table.|$|R
60|$|The young {{fisherman}} {{had become}} more and more agitated, as the writing had become clearer to him. He now left it lying before the captain, over whose shoulder he had been reading it, and dropping <b>into</b> <b>his</b> former <b>seat,</b> leaned forward on the table and laid his face in his hands.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very extraordinary,' said Mr. Pickwick, {{going back}} <b>into</b> <b>his</b> room, and <b>seating</b> {{himself at the}} table in a musing attitude. 'What can that young man be going to do?' ...|$|R
60|$|As Anderson clambered <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> {{once more}} he looked dark and grim.|$|E
60|$|Turnbull spat {{over the}} edge of the car and fell back furiously <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{prisoner}} {{sank back}} <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> trembling with excitement, while the wife {{began to cry}} piteously.|$|E
60|$|In fact, as {{he threw}} himself at one {{dexterous}} dive <b>into</b> <b>his</b> former <b>seat,</b> Mr. Brownlow returned, accompanied by Oliver, whom Mr. Grimwig received very graciously; and if the gratification of that moment {{had been the only}} reward for all her anxiety and care in Oliver's behalf, Rose Maylie would have been well repaid.|$|R
6000|$|She {{forced him}} gently back <b>into</b> <b>his</b> chair, and <b>seated</b> herself upon the floor between his knees. [...] "What were you {{thinking}} of when I came in?" [...] she asked. [...] "You weren't asleep, were you?" ...|$|R
25|$|Biryukova {{parked the}} car {{on the side of the}} road and left Sky {{strapped}} <b>into</b> <b>his</b> car <b>seat</b> inside while she took Maile to find assistance. An hour later, she reached a Chevron station a mile (1.6km) north of where she parked. Instead of buying gas or having someone bring it to her car, she called a friend, who gave her a ride back to her car.|$|R
60|$|He caught Gregory's wrist in a grip {{that made}} him wince, and forced him back <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
60|$|He sank <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat,</b> weeping, and Brickell wept too; {{then they}} parted and never {{saw each other}} again.|$|E
60|$|A laugh {{broke out}} all over the house as Putney dropped back <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat.</b> Mr. Gerrish stood {{apparently}} undaunted.|$|E
5000|$|Johann Wilhelm Wernher (b. 1767; d. 1827 in Nierstein) was a {{government}} councillor, mayor, lawyer, privy councillor and court president, and a winegrower in Nierstein. He {{was well known}} as the judge at Schinderhannes’s trial. In 1804 he acquired the Rodensteiner/Haxthäuser Hof and made it <b>into</b> <b>his</b> family <b>seat</b> in Rhenish Hesse. Among Johann Wilhelm Wernher’s offspring, many were active in Rhenish-Hessian historical research, particularly in Nierstein and Oppenheim.|$|R
6000|$|A word to Madame Vodoz {{effected}} the change; and {{at dinner}} I was rewarded by a grateful smile {{from the poor}} fellow, as he nestled <b>into</b> <b>his</b> warm <b>seat,</b> after a pause of surprise and a flush of pleasure at the small kindness from a stranger. We were too far apart to talk much, but, as he filled his glass, the Pole bowed to me, and said low in French-- ...|$|R

60|$|But Pier Luigi reached forward across Bianca, set a hand upon my cousin's sleeve, {{and pressed}} him back <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> {{silencing}} him.|$|E
6000|$|... "But come, Sam, that story," [...] said Harry and I coaxingly, {{pressing}} upon him, {{and pulling}} him down <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> in the corner.|$|E
60|$|Most prudent persons {{would have}} advised a young prince, under such circumstances, to have decided upon the latter course. But Alexander {{had no idea}} of {{bounding}} his ambition by any such limits. He resolved to spring at once completely <b>into</b> <b>his</b> father's <b>seat,</b> and not only to possess himself of the whole of the power which his father had acquired, but to commence, immediately, the most energetic and vigorous efforts for a great extension of it.|$|R
6000|$|The Doctor sprang <b>into</b> <b>his</b> {{place and}} <b>seated</b> himself on <b>his</b> camel. 'Now ride on, Mr. Sheikh,' he said, 'wid all yer men, as if grim death was afther ye.

50|$|In {{the heavily}} Democratic seat, Barnes faced four {{opponents in the}} Democratic primary, {{included}} DeBose's son, Michael K. DeBose. While The Plain Dealer did not endorse Barnes, {{he went on to}} win the primary. Barnes ran unopposed in the general election, was sworn <b>into</b> <b>his</b> former <b>seat</b> on January 3, 2011. Subsequently, Barnes was named as a member of the Economic and Small Business Development Committee, the Health and Aging Committee, and the Ways and Means Committee. He is also a member of the Vehicle Management Commission.|$|R
6000|$|... "What good's {{arguments}} to me? In Miquelon champagne's eighteen dollars a case, and--" [...] The skipper lurched <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> as an organ-prelude silenced him.|$|E
60|$|But Lord Henry checked him, {{placing a}} {{restraining}} hand upon his sleeve, and forcing him gently back <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat.</b> Himself he now addressed the prisoner.|$|E
60|$|In his eagerness Myndert {{read the}} oracle aloud, {{and then he}} sunk <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat,</b> {{affecting}} {{to laugh at the}} whole as a childish and vain conceit.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit down, sit down, my friends," [...] {{said the}} warden; [...] "I {{want to say}} a word to you and to drink your healths, before I leave you. Come up here, Moody, here is a chair for you; come, Jonathan Crumple;"--and by degrees he got the men to be seated. It was not {{surprising}} that they should hang back with faint hearts, having returned so much kindness with such deep ingratitude. Last of all of them came Bunce, and with sorrowful mien and slow step got <b>into</b> <b>his</b> accustomed <b>seat</b> near the fire-place.|$|R
60|$|The old man {{had sunk}} <b>into</b> a <b>seat.</b> <b>His</b> face and hands were {{twitching}} with fear. His eyes, as though fascinated, remained fixed upon Mannering's. All the while he mumbled to himself. Fardell drew Mannering a little on one side.|$|R
60|$|He {{mechanically}} pursued his way {{round the}} piers <b>into</b> <b>his</b> own <b>seat</b> {{in the north}} aisle. The lower atmosphere of this spot was shaded by its own wall from the shine which streamed in over the window-sills on the same side. The only light burning inside the church was a small tallow candle, standing in the font, in the opposite aisle of the building to that in which Manston had sat down, and near where the furniture was piled. The candle's mild rays were overpowered by the ruddier light from the ruins, making the weak flame to appear like the moon by day.|$|R
