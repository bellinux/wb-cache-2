40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is the {{delimitation}} of groundwater recharge and <b>discharge</b> <b>zones</b> in the centresouth portion of the Mesa Central. This was achieved using groundwater flow systems theory, which {{has proved to be a}} valuable tool since it considers a systemic perspective of the environment, integrating several natural elements. There are various physical, chemical and biological processes generated in the subsoil within which groundwater is incorporated. This involvement is caused by the natural gravitational movement of groundwater which is manifested on the surface by contrasting evidences in the recharge and <b>discharge</b> <b>zones.</b> Therefore, the objective of this paper includes the demonstration of the usefulness of the analysis of those indicators to locate priority areas and also provides an approximation of groundwater functioning.

The Hydraprobe data were analysed to investigate the relationship between soil moisture and salinity at the ground surface. Hydraprobe data showed areas non-saline areas exhibited a uniformly low soil moisture content, consistent with the conceptual model of the <b>discharge</b> <b>zones.</b> Average field soil moisture and salinity data generally correlated well with landforms.

Variation in hydrochemistry between years and variation during yearly occurring spring flooding were analyzed using surface water sampling. Meteorological data were used to relate observed dynamics to weather conditions before and during flooding. For analysis of dynamics between years, data was used of 2001 - 2010. For determination of small-scale variation, a weekly sampling campaign {{was set up in}} transects with a high sampling density, during the spring 2012 flooding. The objective was to determine zones with different water types: river water, rain- or snowmelt water and groundwater, and dynamics therein. Additional evidence was gathered with groundwater samples and Electro Conductivity and temperature profiles of the peat soil up to a depth of 1. 60 m below the water surface. Results showed that dynamics between years were highest where river water flooded the floodplain and where groundwater discharge occurred. The location of the border between river water and rainwater varied spatially over 250 m and depended on flood magnitude and amount of snow present before flooding. A zone could be identified which was flooded with river water each year independent of flood magnitude. <b>Zones</b> with groundwater <b>discharge</b> showed high variation because of mixing with rainwater at the <b>discharge</b> location. <b>Zones</b> were horizontally stable over the course of four weeks during the flood peak and subsequent drawdown. Only the border between river water and rainwater moved riverwards over 50 m during a rain period. Identification of groundwater <b>discharge</b> <b>zones</b> using surface water sampling is problematic in some cases because of high similarity of local groundwater and rainwater. For these cases, EC and temperature profiles of the peat soil provide enough evidence to determine groundwater <b>discharge</b> <b>zones.</b> Groundwater <b>discharge</b> <b>zones</b> are narrow (< 100 m) and flow of groundwater from these zones on the surface and in the shallow soil enables to characterize significant parts of the Biebrza Lower Basin as throughflow mire with stable water quality instead of inundation mire. The current results show that dynamics in water quality between years are substantial and that variation during flooding can be as large as between-year variation. This should be taken into account when characterizing the system and drawing relations between vegetation and hydrology.

40|$|Excessive {{input of}} {{anthropogenic}} reactive nitrogen (Nr) to forested ecosystems {{is associated with}} increased rates of denitrification and possible emission of the potentially harmful greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N 2 O). Denitrification is performed by heterotrophic bacteria, and Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM) is thus required for the process to proceed. Only a fraction of DOM is however assumed to be readily available for the bacteria. In a N- saturated subtropical forest in South China (Tie Shan Ping) potential denitrification rates and growth potential have been investigated {{in the framework of}} a study on N 2 O emissions. Spatial variations were found, displaying higher denitrification rates at the unsaturated hill slope (recharge zone) as compared to the more hydromorphic groundwater <b>discharge</b> <b>zone.</b> These findings were explained by the denitrifiers being C - limited, which was especially evident at the groundwater <b>discharge</b> <b>zone.</b> It was hypothesized that the reduced transport of DOM from the densely vegetated hill slope to the groundwater <b>discharge</b> <b>zone</b> was attributed to rapid mineralization along the flow pat h. This would result in only the more recalcitrant fraction of DOM remaining in solution for transportation to the groundwater <b>discharge</b> <b>zone.</b> The objective of this present study was to test this hypothesis by investigating differences in chemical characteristics and biodegradability of the DOM between the hill slope and the groundwater <b>discharge</b> <b>zone.</b> Soil-water samples collected along a topographic gradient, using suction lysimeters, were subject to both biological-, chemical-, and structural analyses. Measured biodegradability, using a batch experimental setup, suggested that the DOM from the groundwater <b>discharge</b> <b>zone</b> was far more biodegradable than the DOM from the hill slope. This was further corroborated with the structural characterization, using UV - Vis Absorbency and Fluorescence Spectroscopy, indicating small amount of more aromatic, and alow ratio of Humic to Fulvic acids in the DOM from the groundwater <b>discharge</b> <b>zone</b> as compared to the samples from the hill slope. This would imply that the attenuation of DOM along the flow path in Tie Shan Ping could not be attributed to mineralization. Instead, the loss of less biodegradable DOM is suggested to be explained by selective adsorption of the more aromatic, higher molecular weight, hydrophobic constituents of DOM to the clay-rich and organic-poor soils of the hill slope...|$|E

Flushing can be aided by vibration of either tool or workpiece. Thus, applying ultrasonic vibration to micro EDM has proven to enhance the process significantly.

40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comLimitations to agricultural productivity imposed by the root-zone constraints in Australian dryland soils are severe and need redemption to improve the yields of grain crops and thereby meet world demand. Physical, chemical and biological constraints in soil horizons impose a stress on the plant and restrict plant growth and development. Hardsetting, crusting, compaction, salinity, sodicity, acidity, alkalinity, nutrient deficiencies and toxicities due to boron, carbonates and aluminium are the major factors that cause these constraints. Further, subsoils in agricultural regions in Australia have very low organic matter and biological activity. Dryland salinity is currently given wide attention in the public debate and government policies in Australia, but they only focus on salinity induced by shallow groundwater. However, the occurrence of transient salinity in root-zone layers in the regions where water tables are deep is an important issue with potential for larger economic loss than water table-induced seepage salinity. Root-zone constraints pose a challenge for salinity mitigation in recharge as well as <b>discharge</b> <b>zones.</b> In recharge zones, reduced water movement in sodic horizons results in salt accumulation in the root zone resulting in chemical and physical constraints that reduce transpiration that, in turn, upsets salt balance and plant growth. High salinity in soil and groundwater restricts the ability of plants to reduce water table in <b>discharge</b> <b>zones.</b> Thus plantbased strategies must address different kinds of limitations in soil profiles, both in recharge and <b>discharge</b> <b>zones.</b> In this paper we give an overview of plant response to root-zone constraints but with an emphasis on the processes of salt accumulation in the root-zone of soils. We also examine physical and chemical methods to overcome subsoil limitations, the ability of plants to adapt to and ameliorate these constraints, soil modification by management of agricultural and forestry ecosystems, the use of biological activity, and plant breeding for resistance to the soil constraints. We emphasise that soil scientists in cooperation with agronomists and plant breeders should design site-specific strategies to overcome multiple soil constraints, with vertical and lateral variations, and to develop plant-based solutions for dryland salinity.
