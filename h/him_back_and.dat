5|$|On Beecham's {{return to}} England in 1944 the LPO welcomed <b>him</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> in October they gave a concert {{together}} that drew superlatives from the critics. Over the next months Beecham and the orchestra gave further concerts with considerable success, but the LPO players, now their own employers, {{declined to give}} him the unfettered control that he had exercised in the 1930s. If he were to become chief conductor again it would be as a paid employee of the orchestra. Beecham, unwilling to be answerable to anybody, left the LPO and in 1946 founded a rival orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic (RPO).|$|E
5|$|Orme and La Fleche {{met again}} in the Gordon Stakes at Goodwood with two other opponents, Watercress and Royal Harry. Starting favourite, Orme had La Fleche in trouble {{with more than a}} quarter of a mile still to run. He seemed to have the race won, but then veered left forcing Morny Cannon to pull <b>him</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> {{allowing}} La Fleche to draw level. However Orme pulled away again and won by a neck, with Watercress a further six lengths back in third. Orme's final race came in the Limekiln Stakes where he had to carry 10 stone. He finished second to Childwick, who was receiving 33 pounds. During the autumn Orme's legs had started to give him trouble and during the Limekiln a suspensory ligament gave way. This injury brought an end to his racing career, and he was retired to stud. Throughout his racing career he won a total of £32,528 in prize money.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was a King of the Mountain {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship with Kevin Nash as Special Guest Ringside Enforcer between then-champion Samoa Joe and the challengers Booker T, Christian Cage, Rhino, and Robert Roode. In a King of the Mountain match, the {{objective}} is to climb a ladder and hang the championship belt on a hook above the ring. In order to do so, a wrestler must first qualify by either pinning or making another wrestler submit in the match. A wrestler who is pinned or made to submit is this placed in a penalty box for two minutes. The match is fought under no disqualification rules. Booker T was the first to qualify by pinning Rhino after slamming him back-first into the mat with his signature Book End maneuver. Rhino was this placed in the penalty box. Roode was the next to qualify after bashing a ladder Cage held with a chair into him and following with a pin. Immediately afterwards, Rhino pinned Roode with a roll-up pin to qualify. Later, Joe held Booker T in his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold when Cage ascended a padded turnbuckle and jumped off onto Booker T and Joe. He followed by pinning Booker T to qualify and send Booker T to the penalty box. When Booker T was released from the box, he attacked Nash with the title belt and then attempted to hang it. Nash stopped him and then dropped Booker T back-first against the mat with his signature Jackknife Powerbomb maneuver. Joe was the last to qualify by pinning Roode after slamming <b>him</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> neck-first into the mat with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver. Joe then hung the title belt at 19 minutes and 49 seconds to win the competition.|$|E

25|$|Telemaque was {{purchased}} at about age 14 by Joseph Vesey, a Bermudian sea captain and slave merchant. After a time, Vesey sold the youth to a planter in French Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti). When the youth {{was found to}} suffer epileptic fits, Vesey took <b>him</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> returned his purchase price to the former master. Biographer Egerton {{found no evidence of}} Vesey having epilepsy later in life. He suggests that Vesey may have faked the seizures in order to escape the particularly brutal conditions on Saint-Domingue.|$|E
25|$|Knuckles' {{animation}} debut {{came with}} the 1996 Japanese Sonic the Hedgehog OVA. Sonic and Tails meet him in an alternate dimension, and {{over the course of}} the film he helps them defeat Black Eggman (Metal Robotnik) and Hyper Metal Sonic, two robots created by Doctor Eggman (Doctor Robotnik). As Metal Sonic is about to descend into a lava pit, Sonic attempts to save him after all, but Knuckles holds <b>him</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> Sonic is disappointed. Knuckles play-fights with Sonic a few times in the film as well.|$|E
25|$|At this time, {{tensions}} became heightened {{with the}} Venetians {{as a slave}} of the Ottoman commander of Athens fled to the Venetian fortress of Coron (Koroni) with 100,000 aspers from his master's treasury. The Venetians refused to hand <b>him</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> in retaliation, Ömer attacked the port town of Lepanto (Nafpaktos) in November 1462 but failed to capture it. A few months later, Isa Bey, governor of the Morea, took the Venetian fortress of Argos through treason. These events precipitated the outbreak of a long war between the Venetian Republic and the Ottoman Empire. In the summer of 1463, Ömer led the eastern wing of the Ottoman army that conquered Bosnia.|$|E

25|$|Death's Head's first {{appearance}} after High Noon Tex {{was in the}} Transformers, seeing him attempt to claim the bounty that Rodimus Prime had placed on Galvatron's head, travelling {{back in time to}} the 1980s in pursuit of his quarry. Realising the error he had made in placing the bounty, Rodimus followed <b>him</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> stopped him from destroying Galvatron, forcibly returning him to the future. Subsequently, Death's Head was contracted by the Decepticons to take out Rodimus Prime, a piece of business that Death's Head considered a pleasure. However, Rodimus outsmarted him, and instead paid him to terminate Cyclonus and Scourge. Over {{the course of the next}} year, Death's Head pursued them, eventually confronting them on the Planet of Junk, where they all fell under the mental control of Unicron.|$|E
25|$|The Company {{moved on}} Lobengula during October and early November 1893, {{and used the}} inexorable {{firepower}} of its Maxim machine guns to crush attacks by the far larger Matabele army as it rode south-west. As the whites approached his royal town at Bulawayo, Lobengula fled, torching it as he went. Company troops were despatched to bring <b>him</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> the resultant pursuit north ended with the ambush and annihilation of the 34-man Shangani Patrol by the remnants of Lobengula's army on 4 December 1893. The king died from smallpox while on his way north in January 1894, and his izinDuna made peace with the Company soon after. Bulawayo was rebuilt as a Company-run city atop {{the ruins of the}} former Matabele capital. Rhodes subsequently funded education for three of Lobengula's sons.|$|E
25|$|On May 5, after Grant's army {{crossed the}} Rapidan {{and entered the}} Wilderness of Spotsylvania, it was {{attacked}} by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Although Lee was outnumbered, about 60,000 to 100,000, his men fought fiercely and the dense foliage provided a terrain advantage. After two days of fighting and almost 29,000 casualties, the results were inconclusive and neither army was able to obtain an advantage. Lee had stopped Grant, but had not turned <b>him</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> Grant had not destroyed Lee's army. Under similar circumstances, previous Union commanders had chosen to withdraw behind the Rappahannock, but Grant instead ordered Meade to move around Lee's right flank and seize the important crossroads at Spotsylvania Court House to the southeast, hoping that by interposing his army between Lee and Richmond, he could lure the Confederates into another battle on a more favorable field.|$|E

25|$|Andrés Bonifacio {{called for}} a general {{offensive}} on Manila and was defeated in battle at the town of San Juan del Monte. He regrouped his forces {{and was able to}} briefly capture the towns of Marikina, San Mateo and Montalban. Spanish counterattacks drove <b>him</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> he retreated to the mountains of Balara and Morong and from there engaged in guerrilla warfare. By August 30, the revolt had spread to eight provinces. On that date, Governor-General Ramon Blanco declared a state of war in these provinces and placed them under martial law. These were Manila, Bulacan, Cavite, Pampanga, Tarlac, Laguna, Batangas, and Nueva Ecija. They would later be represented in the eight rays of the sun in the Filipino flag. Emilio Aguinaldo and the Katipuneros of Cavite were the most successful of the rebels and they controlled most of their province by September–October. They defended their territories with trenches designed by Edilberto Evangelista.|$|E
25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox.

I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed <b>him</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> he accepted and here we are.|$|E

Meanwhile, he reads the {{newspaper}} in hope that his stock has gone up, but it has in fact fallen in value. The next day, Kramer (Michael Richards) tells Jerry that his stock has fallen again. Jerry calls George to get advice from Wilkinson, the man who gave the stock tip in the first place, but no one can find him. George rings <b>him</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> tells Jerry that Wilkinson is in the hospital. While visiting the dry cleaner, Jerry tells George that he wants to sell his stock, but George insists that the tip is good and they should keep the stock. Eventually, George says he will go and visit Wilkinson {{to find out what they}} should do, despite the fact that George does not know him personally.|$|E

25|$|The wicket was {{not quite}} the batsman's paradise of the {{previous}} Tests, but after bowling a couple of maidens Garth McKenzie conceded 15 runs off his third over. Brian Luckhurst kept trying to steal singles, while his partner Geoff Boycott kept sending <b>him</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> England were 100/0 at lunch. Boycott was caught hooking by John Gleeson at fine-leg for 77 out of 116, and Gleeson had Luckhurst leg before wicket for 38 at 130/2. John Edrich made 55 before Gleeson caught him off Greg Chappell, Ashley Mallett (4/40) accounted for Fletcher and D'Oliveira, had Alan Knott stumped by Marsh to reduce England from 200/2 to 219/6. Gleeson bowled Illingworth for 24 and England were 267/7 {{at the end of}} the day. John Snow (37) made runs in the morning but Gleeson (4/83) struck again, dismissing him and Underwood in successive balls. Peter Lever (36) and Bob Willis (15 not out) added 41 for the last wicket to carry England to 332, the lowest first innings total of the series so far.|$|E
25|$|In 1714, {{he moved}} {{to work at the}} new theatre at Lincoln's Inn Fields, managed by {{entrepreneur}} John Rich. Remaining there for most of his career, he returned to his English repertoire and a new form, the musical Afterpiece. These lightweight works were often comic, and in 1716 Leveridge produced his own afterpiece, Pyramus and Thisbe. For this comic parody of Italian opera, he wrote the music, adapting the words from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, and sang the role of Pyramus. He was apparently absent from the stage around 1720–24, during which time he was occupied with the coffee house in Tavistock Street near Covent Garden, at the sign of 'The Harlequin and Pierot', which he held by lease from 1714 to 1736. However Rich drew <b>him</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> Leveridge scored a success in 1726 in Apollo and Daphne with Silenus's song Tho' envious old age seems in part to impair me, composed by Johann Ernst Galliard. From that time forth he became the leading bass at Lincoln's Inn Fields and then at Covent Garden.|$|E
25|$|Peter May {{required}} several {{operations and}} did not play in the 1960 season, but {{he was expected to}} return and Cowdrey was only made captain of England against South Africa as each game came up, rather than for the whole series. Even so, {{it was the first of}} only two occasions that Cowdrey captained England throughout a Test series. It proved to be an easy 3–0 win as the inexperienced Springbok side met a damp English summer and lost the first three Tests by 100 runs, an innings and 73 runs and 8 wickets. In the Third Test the South African captain Jackie McGlew was run out after colliding with an English fielder, the umpires did not allow Cowdrey to call <b>him</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> he was widely blamed for not withdrawing the appeal before McGlew left the field. In the Fifth Test England were dismissed for 155, saw South Africa make 479/9 declared and were criticised by Walter Robins, the new Chairman of Selectors. In response Cowdrey made 155 and added 290 for the first wicket with Geoff Pullar (175) to save the match.|$|E
