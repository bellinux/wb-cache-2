500|$|A side {{benefit of}} Tchaikovsky's {{friendship}} with Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov was an increased {{confidence in his}} own abilities as a composer, along with a willingness to let his musical works stand alongside those of his contemporaries. Tchaikovsky wrote to von Meck in January 1889, after being once again well represented in Belyayev's concerts, that he had [...] "always tried to place myself outside all parties and to show in every way possible that <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> respect every honorable and gifted public figure in music, whatever his tendency", and that he considered himself [...] "flattered {{to appear on the}} concert platform" [...] beside composers in the Belyayev circle. This was an acknowledgment of wholehearted readiness for his music to be heard with that of these composers, delivered in a tone of implicit confidence that there were no comparisons from which to fear.|$|E

They're really hunted by their fans much more. I remember driving around these remote towns in Wales and kids running after us in the street. I was like, 'This is horrible!' And I saw the effect it had on him, and that's when I decided I never wanted to be a celebrity at that level, and I think that's why I've chosen to do the work that I do and just kind of work with directors that <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> try and do work that means something to me." ...|$|E

During an interview with Essence, LaBelle said that she was first introduced to R music after her parents emigrated from Bulgaria to the United States. She recounted that she was initially discouraged from pursuing a career in the genre, but later said that she was not concerned with [...] "the clichés surrounding white artists singing R". She followed this up saying: [...] "I just want to make good music. I'm here and I'm doing what <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> the music that I love. It's going to reach who it's supposed to reach." [...] LaBelle was identified as a blue-eyed soul singer by Essence.|$|E
500|$|Shakira's {{record label}} at that time, Epic Records, opposed the {{decision}} to release and commission Laundry Service as they [...] "wanted her just to throw a couple of songs in English on a Latin record." [...] Estefan argued with Tommy Mottola, then head of Sony Music Entertainment (the parent company of Epic Records), and convinced him to release the album, arguing that an [...] "American audience" [...] would not buy a Spanish record simply due to its inclusion of a few English tracks. In an interview with Latina, she said [...] "I got in the trenches there with Tommy [...] - I fought for that. Because they didn't believe it.

500|$|Although {{primarily}} a pop rock album, Laundry Service also draws influences {{from a variety}} of musical genres. The singer credited this to her mixed ethnicity, saying [...] "I am a fusion. That's my persona. I'm a fusion between black and white, between pop and rock, between cultures - between my Lebanese father and my mother's Spanish blood, the Colombian folklore and Arab dance <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> American music." [...] Arabian and Middle Eastern elements, which had a high influence on Dónde Están los Ladrones?, are also present in Laundry Service, most prominently on [...] "Eyes Like Yours" [...] (Ojos Así). Musical styles from different South American countries surface on the album. Tango, a style of fast-paced ballroom dance that originated in Argentina, is evident on [...] "Objection (Tango)", which also combines elements of rock and roll. The uptempo track features a guitar solo and a bridge in which Shakira delivers rap-like vocals. [...] "Whenever, Wherever" [...] blends pop rock with Andean music and contains instrumentation from panpipes and the charango - traditional instruments generally associated with the genre.|$|E

Aware that this would result in his expulsion from Labour, he publicly stated that [...] "I have been forced to choose between the party <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> upholding the democratic rights of Londoners." [...] The polls indicated clear support for Livingstone among the London electorate, with his campaign being run by his Socialist Action associates. He gained the support {{of a wide range of}} celebrities, from musicians like Fatboy Slim, Pink Floyd, the Chemical Brothers, and Blur, artists like Damian Hirst and Tracey Emin, and those from other fields, among them Ken Loach, Jo Brand, and Chris Evans, the latter of whom donated £200,000 to the campaign; half of what Livingstone required. In March 2000, Livingstone agreed to make a public apology to the House of Commons, after he was criticised over his failure to properly register outside interests worth more than £150,000. The election took place in May 2000, at which Livingstone came first with 58% of first and second-preference votes; Conservative candidate Steven Norris came second and Dobson third. Livingstone started his acceptance speech with [...] "As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted 14 years ago..." ...|$|E
500|$|Stylistically, One Hot Minute diverged {{from the}} Chili Peppers' {{previous}} records—especially Blood Sugar Sex Magik. The album {{was characterized by}} prominent use of heavy metal guitar riffs and hints of psychedelic rock. Navarro, unlike Flea and Kiedis, was not influenced by funk music. He told Guitar World in 1996, [...] "It doesn't really speak to me. But then again, when I'm playing with three other guys who <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> feel camaraderie with, it's enjoyable to play funk." [...] Navarro's own style was influenced mainly by classic rock guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page, as well as gothic rock guitarists Robert Smith and Daniel Ash. Continuing a trend that started on Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Kiedis diverged even further away from his signature rapping, only doing so on a few tracks. One Hot Minute took almost two years to write, and its recording and production was not a smooth process. Navarro {{felt as though he}} was an outsider to the other members. His writing in Jane's Addiction was independent from other contributors, whereas the Red Hot Chili Peppers was a far more collaborative group. Navarro himself noted that the band's dynamic was more balanced than that of Jane's Addiction, which was often dominated by frontman Perry Farrell.|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Don't Judge Me" [...] {{was directed by}} Colin Tilley and Brown, and was filmed in August 2012. On August 29, 2012 Brown released an image from the shoot, showing himself seated {{on the floor of}} an abandoned room in an unbuttoned jacket. On September 11, 2012 Brown released a similar image, tweeting, [...] "'Don't Judge Me' video coming soon!". The video premiered on Vimeo on September 27, 2012. It begins with Brown walking through the desert, while intercut scenes of himself sitting in front of a couch (with his girlfriend, played by Runa Lucienne, sleeping behind him) are shown. As the chorus begins for the first time, Brown is seen catching a ride from an army truck. He eventually arrives at an army base to prepare for a [...] "suicide mission", which involves him riding a spacecraft into outer space to save the world from an alien ship invading Earth. A news reporter at the base (Brown's girlfriend) runs to him with the question, [...] "People are saying this is a suicide mission, why are you doing this?" [...] Brown replies, [...] "I'm doing a service for my country and my planet. If that means saving the people <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> I care about, then that's what I'll do." [...] As the spacecraft takes off, tears run down Brown's face before the spacecraft crashes into the alien ship, killing him. Brown and his girlfriend are then shown, hugging on the couch.|$|E
500|$|Writer Kinberg {{would later}} state that [...] "there {{are a lot}} of things about 'X3' that <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> there {{are a lot of}} things that I regret", {{detailing}} that he would have preferred the Dark Phoenix as the main plotline and [...] "I would have fought harder" [...] for that, considering that at the period [...] "the darkness of her story was a little bit daunting on a huge $200 million studio movie" [...] leading Fox to ask for rewrites. Previous X-Men director Bryan Singer declared that The Last Stand [...] "isn't what I would have done" [...] and he was dissatisfied with the busy plot and excessive character deaths, but Singer still liked some parts of the movie, such as Ellen Page's casting – leading Singer to bring her back as Kitty Pryde in [...] – and the scenes with Leech, which he described as [...] "really sweet moments". Matthew Vaughn, who was attached as director before dropping out, criticized Ratner's direction: [...] "I could have done something with far more emotion and heart. I'm probably going to be told off for saying that, but I genuinely believe it." [...] While promoting his own installment of the franchise, 2011's , Vaughn would say regarding The Last Stand that [...] "I storyboarded the whole bloody film, did the script. My X3 would have been 40 minutes longer. They didn't let the emotions and the drama play in that film. It became wall-to-wall noise and drama. I would have let it breathe and given far more dramatic elements to it." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2013, Beyoncé {{embarked}} {{her fourth}} concert tour, The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour. In June 2013, {{it was announced}} that a limited edition of Heat, titled Heat: The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour, would be released the same month, inspired by the tour. Speaking about the fragrance, Beyoncé said: [...] "I love my music, I love performing and most of all <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> appreciate my fans. I wanted to give them a special remembrance of this tour and I created this scent to reflect the power, passion and playfulness I put into my performances." [...] The fragrance opens with mangosteen, black pepper and Açaí palm as its top notes and later continues with violet petals, Indian Sambac Jasmine and a Brassia Edua Loo orchid as its middle notes before finishing with bourbon vanilla, Australian sandalwood and vetiver as its base notes. Gaby Wilson of MTV noted that the ingredients introduced a lighter scent than her previous releases. According to Beyoncé's official perfume website, the fragrance is [...] "paying tribute to Beyoncé's amazing momentous journey" [...] and further [...] "transport you into Beyoncé's world and the intensity of her shows. [...] will make you feel the power, passion and playfulness she gives to her fans." [...] It was also meant to celebrate Beyoncé's accomplishments and her [...] "historic life journey". Gregory DelliCarpini Jr. of Billboard magazine described the scent of the fragrance as [...] "strong and feminine". Holly Carter of People magazine noted that the scent was [...] "the best-smelling alternative" [...] for people who missed The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour.|$|E

It's 27 years later. And I have to say, I love Lydia Deetz so much. She was such a huge part of me. I would be really interested in what she is doing 27 years later." [...] Ryder confirmed that she would only consider making a sequel if Burton and Keaton were involved. In December 2014, Burton stated, [...] "It's a character that <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> I miss actually working with Michael. There's only one Betelgeuse. We're working on a script and I think it's probably closer than ever and I'd love to work with him again." [...] In January 2015, writer Grahame-Smith told Entertainment Weekly that the script was finished and that he and Burton intended to start filming Beetlejuice 2 {{by the end of the}} year, and that both Keaton and Ryder would return in their respective roles. In August 2015, on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Ryder confirmed she would be reprising her role in the sequel. In May 2016, Burton stated, [...] "It's something that I really would like to do in the right circumstances, but it's one of those films where it has to be right. It's not a kind of a movie that cries out , it's not the Beetlejuice trilogy. So it's something that if the elements are right—because I do love the character and Michael's amazing as that character, so yeah we'll see. But there's nothing concrete yet." ...|$|E

[...] Regarding Nathan, Giuliani said [...] "I'm going to need her now more than maybe I did before", making reference to his battle with cancer and her background in nursing. Regarding the senate race, he again did not commit to a decision, saying, [...] "I don't really care about politics right now. [...] I'm thinking about my family, the people that <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> {{what can be done}} that's honest and truthful and that protects them the best. [...] I'm not thinking about politics. Politics comes at least second, maybe third, maybe fourth, somewhere else. It'll all work itself out some way politically." [...] Giuliani had, however, neglected to inform Hanover in advance of his announcement; her reaction was {{described as}} distraught. [...] Three hours later, she held her own news conference at Gracie Mansion, where she said, [...] "Today's turn of events brings me great sadness. I had hoped to keep this marriage together. For several years, it was difficult to participate in Rudy's public life because of his relationship with one staff member." [...] In this, she was making reference to Cristyne Lategano, the former communications director for Giuliani; Vanity Fair had reported in 1997 that Lategano and Giuliani were having an affair, which both of them had denied. [...] Hanover continued, [...] "Beginning last May, I made a major effort to bring us back together. Rudy and I re-established some of our personal intimacy through the fall.
