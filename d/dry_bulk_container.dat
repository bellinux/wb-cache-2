5000|$|Some {{short sea}} ship vessels are {{small enough to}} travel inland on inland waterways. Short sea {{shipping}} includes the movements of wet and <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> cargoes, <b>containers</b> and passengers around the coast (say from Lisbon to Rotterdam or from New Orleans to Philadelphia). Typical ship sizes range from 1,000 DWT (tonnes deadweight - i.e. the amount of cargo they carry) to 15,000 DWT with drafts ranging from around 3 to 6 m. Typical cargoes include grain, fertilisers, steel, coal, salt, stone, scrap and minerals (all in bulk), oil products (such as diesel oil, kerosene, aviation spirit - all in <b>bulk),</b> <b>containers</b> and passengers. Short sea shipping should not be mistaken with inland navigation.|$|R

40|$|This paper applies modern {{portfolio}} {{theory to}} manage portfolio risk for real shipping investments. The {{aim is to}} propose a multi-factor model for explaining vessel return variation. In doing so, we seek to improve extant research on shipping markets and clarify the underlying risk factors in the industry. To corroborate {{the necessity of a}} more comprehensive model, we include other well-established methods for comparison. The study comprises the three main shipping segments, i. e. wet <b>bulk,</b> <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> and <b>container.</b> By including different segments, an investor can diversify segment-specific risks connected to the particular trade flows and seasonal demand patterns. Additionally, we include vessel size and age to enrich the investment universe. Different sized vessels are exposed to different trades due to characteristics of cargo and physical limitations, e. g. stowage factor and canal dimensions. Larger vessels are therefore exposed to more operational risk in terms of flexibility than smaller vessels. The age factor also represents a differing risk profile of the investment, as newer vessels with favorable cost structures are theoretically less risky albeit more expensive. We find clear differences in risk-return characteristics regarding all three aspects between the various vessels. This indicates great diversification potential. We show the superiority of the multi-factor model compared to the naïve and single-index optimization frameworks. Our model highlights five main risk factors and vastly improves the explanatory power of return variation. From a statistical point of view, a diversified portfolio outperforms segment-specific portfolios within <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> and <b>container</b> vessels. This is not the case for wet bulk, following the strong performance of recent years. Economically, we find recent trends in shipping to accommodate diversification following a decomposition of the value chain, e. g. Ship Finance International Ltd. This enables diversifying across all segments, in turn reducing cash-flow volatility and possibly adding value for shareholders. nhhma...|$|R

40|$|The world {{economic}} situation has brightened in 2010. However, multiple risks threaten {{to undermine the}} prospects of a sustained recovery and a stable world economy – including sovereign debt problems in many developed regions, and fiscal austerity. These risks are further magnified by the extraordinary shocks {{that have occurred in}} 2011, which have included natural disasters and political unrest, as well as rising and volatile energy and commodity prices. Given that for shipping, all stands and falls with worldwide macroeconomic conditions, the developments in world seaborne trade mirrored the performance of the wider economy. After contracting in 2009, international shipping experienced an upswing in demand in 2010, and recorded a positive turnaround in seaborne trade volumes especially in the <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> and <b>container</b> trade segments. However, the outlook remains fragile, as seaborne trade is subject to the same uncertainties and shocks that face the world economy.

30|$|Four {{hypotheses}} {{were tested in}} order to further analyze the influencing factors on SSS. First, a longer coastline does not necessarily imply a larger SSS volume. Second, {{it is not so much}} a large absolute value of the GDP of a country that leads to more SSS, but especially a large value of the GDP relative to the number of inhabitants (GDP per head), which relates to a larger SSS volume. Third, the number of SSS ports (in total as well as only small or large SSS ports) was shown to correlate strongly with total SSS volume. Especially the number of large SSS ports displayed a very high correlation with total SSS volume and was also included in the multivariate linear regression model for total SSS volume and liquid bulk SSS. This indicates that it is not so much a higher total number of SSS ports that leads to a larger SSS volume, but more specifically a higher number of large SSS ports which each handle more than 10 million tons per year. The final hypothesis states that a large rail infrastructure relates to a smaller SSS volume. The results indicate that countries with a large rail network in general have a smaller <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> and <b>container</b> SSS volume.|$|R
40|$|Understanding Shipping Management {{requires}} {{a thorough understanding}} of the Shipping Industry Structure. This book provides this knowledge base and should be seen in conjunction with two other books: Shipping and Design Innovation in Shipping. Shipping Industry Structure was intended as the first part of a book on shipping management; the second part should discuss the different management domains in shipping, such as strategy, finance, investment and risk, marketing, operations, organisation and information. Although this second part was well underway, it has not been finalises due to my resignation from my chair in shipping at the Delft", University of Technology. Shipping Industry Structure gives an overview of the shipping markets in terms of companies, their size and type of fleets and compares the industry structure in the six main markets which represent 85 per cent of the world fleet. These are: oil tanker shipping, chemical tanker shipping, gas tanker shipping, <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> shipping, <b>container</b> shipping and reefer shipping. The development of these six shipping markets is traced from its, origins to the present which provides the reader with a comprehensive understanding of many decades of development. It is recommended reading for all those involved in the shipping industry, whether from the academic, institutional or business world. Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Venezuela {{does not}} have a main port in the region of Lake Maracaibo while the {{expectations}} of the government of Venezuela for Lake Maracaibo are high. In the current situation, there are many small ports that are positioned at different locations. The government of Venezuela would like to construct one main port in the region between The Gulf of Venezuela and Lake Maracaibo. The future port has to contribute to the necessary economic growth and at the same time, the environmental conditions of Lake Maracaibo have to be improved. To gain more cargo throughputs and reduce the contamination of salinity in Lake Maracaibo, this deep water port needs to be created and the channel between Lake Maracaibo and the Gulf of Venezuela need to be closed for sea going vessels. By creating a deep water port, cargo such as oil, coal, iron ore, petrochemicals, cement grain, other <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> and <b>containers</b> is converged and can be transported in larger consignments. In the thesis, four alternative harbour lay-outs are created and evaluated with a Multi Criteria Evaluation.

40|$|Transportation {{networks}} play {{a crucial}} role in human mobility, the exchange of goods and the spread of invasive species. With 90 per cent of world trade carried by sea, the global network of merchant ships provides one of the most important modes of transportation. Here, we use information about the itineraries of 16 363 cargo ships during the year 2007 to construct a network of links between ports. We show that the network has several features that set it apart from other transportation networks. In particular, most ships can be classified into three categories: <b>bulk</b> <b>dry</b> carriers, <b>container</b> ships and oil tankers. These three categories do not only differ in the ships' physical characteristics, but also in their mobility patterns and networks. Container ships follow regularly repeating paths whereas <b>bulk</b> <b>dry</b> carriers and oil tankers move less predictably between ports. The network of all ship movements possesses a heavy-tailed distribution for the connectivity of ports and for the loads transported on the links with systematic differences between ship types. The data analysed in this paper improve current assumptions based on gravity models of ship movements, an important step towards understanding patterns of global trade and bioinvasion...|$|R

30|$|Based on the {{literature}} and the data {{we have been able}} to find, we have formulated four hypotheses about SSS: 1) a longer coastline leads to more SSS, 2) a higher GDP leads to more SSS, 3) more ports lead to more SSS, and 4) a large rail infrastructure leads to less SSS. First, a longer coastline does not necessarily imply a larger SSS volume. Although the coastline was shown in Table 2 to correlate significantly with total SSS volume, coastline was not included as a factor in any of the multivariate linear regression models. The reason for this is that the explanatory power of coastline is limited and other (related) factors, such as the total number of SSS ports or the number of large SSS ports show a much stronger relationship with the total SSS volume. Second, even though GDP was shown to correlate strongly with total SSS volume, it is not included in any of the multivariate linear regression models. However, the GDP per head is included as a factor in the multivariate linear regression model for total SSS volume, liquid bulk SSS volume and <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> SSS volume. This indicates that it is not so much a high absolute value of the GDP of a country that leads to more SSS, but especially a high value of the GDP relative to the number of inhabitants (GDP per head), which relates to a larger SSS volume. Third, the number of SSS ports (in total as well as only small or large SSS ports) was shown to correlate strongly with total SSS volume. Especially the number of large SSS ports displayed a very high correlation with total SSS volume and was also included in the multivariate linear regression model for total SSS volume and liquid bulk SSS. This indicates that it is not so much a higher total number of SSS ports that leads to a larger SSS volume, but more specifically a higher number of large SSS ports which each handle more than 10 million tons per year. For the RO-RO SSS volume on the other hand, the total number of SSS ports is more relevant as indicated by its inclusion in the multivariate linear regression model for RO-RO SSS volume. Either case confirms the third hypotheses that, in general: a higher number of ports relates to a larger SSS volume. The final hypothesis states that a large rail infrastructure relates to a smaller SSS volume. The factor rail length was shown to correlate strongly with SSS volume, but was not included in the multivariate linear regression model for the total SSS volume. However, it was included in the multivariate linear regression models for <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> SSS volume and container SSS volume. In both of these models the coefficient of rail length was negative, which confirms the hypothesis that a higher rail length relates to a smaller SSS volume, but only for these two SSS segments. This indicates that countries with a large rail network in general have a smaller <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> and <b>container</b> SSS volume.|$|R
