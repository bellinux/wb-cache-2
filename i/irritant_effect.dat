25|$|Overexposure to {{ethyl acetate}} may cause {{irritation}} of the eyes, nose, and throat. Severe overexposure may cause weakness, drowsiness, and unconsciousness. Humans {{exposed to a}} concentration of 400ppm in 1.4mg/L ethyl acetate {{for a short time}} were affected by nose and throat irritation. Ethyl acetate is an irritant of the conjunctiva and mucous membrane of the respiratory tract. Animal experiments have shown that, at very high concentrations, the ester has central nervous system depressant and lethal effects; at concentrations of 20,000 to 43,000ppm (2.0–4.3%), there may be pulmonary edema with hemorrhages, symptoms of central nervous system depression, secondary anemia and liver damage. In humans, concentrations of 400ppm cause irritation of the nose and pharynx; cases have also been known of irritation of the conjunctiva with temporary opacity of the cornea. In rare cases exposure may cause sensitization of the mucous membrane and eruptions of the skin. The <b>irritant</b> <b>effect</b> of ethyl acetate is weaker than that of propyl acetate or butyl acetate.|$|E

50|$|By {{preventing}} the drug from dissolving into the stomach, enteric coating may protect gastric mucosa from the irritating {{effects of the}} medication itself. When the drug reaches the neutral or alkaline environment of the intestine, its active ingredients can then dissolve and become available for absorption into the bloodstream. Drugs that have an <b>irritant</b> <b>effect</b> on the stomach, such as aspirin or potassium chloride, can be coated with a substance that will dissolve only in the small intestine.

40|$|The free {{fatty acids}} (FFA) of human surface lipids have been implicated by {{indirect}} evidence in the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris, and a previous study defined the greater irritancy or penetration of the C 8 to C 14 fatty acids. In the present analysis, done by another method, these differing degrees of irritancy were confirmed statistically, and a comparative study of FFA irritancy was done in patients with and without acne. The even numbered {{free fatty acids}} from C 2 to C 16 were applied daily under occlusive patch tests to human skin until detectable erythema appeared. C 8, C 10 and C 12 {{were found to be}} significantly more irritating than C 14, which, in turn, was significantly more irritating than the group C 2, C 4 and C 6, C 16 fatty acid was non-irritating. The comparison of sensitivity between the skin of patients with acne and those without acne to the <b>irritant</b> <b>effects</b> of FFA revealed no significant differences. The immediate response of both groups to C 8, C 10 and C 12 acids failed to define whether a significant difference might exist for these highly irritating chain lengths. The similarities in response of both groups to the other chain lengths suggest, however, that the skin of the patient with acne is no more sensitive to irritant FFA than normal skin. Although the conditions of the study did not reproduce the pathophysiologic state in the follicle in acne, we believe that these data exclude the alternative that the skin of the patient with acne is more sensitive to the <b>irritant</b> <b>effects</b> of FFA than the skin of patients without acne...|$|R

50|$|As an {{explanation}} for these findings {{it has been argued}} that the major limitation with delivery of nicotine by current nicotine replacement therapy products is that they do not provide smokers with the combination of a rapid delivery of nicotine and the unique respiratory tract sensory cues of inhaled nicotine (particularly upper airway irritation) which together are of primary importance in relieving craving for cigarettes. The nicotine nasal spray does achieve rapid delivery of nicotine but lacks the inhalational cues of cigarettes and has demonstrated limited acceptability due to the local <b>irritant</b> <b>effects</b> of nicotine on the nasal mucosa.
