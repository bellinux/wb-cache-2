40|$|A new {{sensitive}} radioimmunoassay {{method for}} measuring reverse triiodothyronine (rT 3) concentrations in dried blood samples, designed to screen newborn infants for congenital hypothyroidism, has been developed. Paper strips are impregnated with cord blood and dried. Duplicate 5 -mm diameter discs are punched {{from the paper}} strips and added directly to the radioimmunoassay reaction mixture. After incubation, bound and free hormone are separated by dextran-coated charcoal. The disc remains in the solution throughout the procedure and the assay can be completed within 24 hr. Recovery of rT 3 is greater than 95 % and coefficients of variation are 9. 4 % (intraassay) and 12. 2 % (interassay) at an rT 3 concentration of 220 ng/dl. At very low rT 3 concentrations (25 ng/dl), coefficients of variation are 14. 2 % (intraassay) and 18. 7 % (interassay). The method readily detects 12. 5 ng/dl of rT 3. With this paper disc method, rT 3 was measured in 38 newborns and compared with serum rT 3 measured in the same subjects by a standard radioimmunoassay method. The correlation between rT 3 values measured in <b>dried</b> blood <b>disc</b> and in serum was very high (r = 0. 918). The rT 3 in <b>dried</b> blood <b>discs</b> from the cord blood of 745 normal newborns was 228. 9 +/- 76. 0 ng/dl (mean +/- SD). In contrast, two infants with proven congenital hypothyroidism had rT 3 values of 35 and 75 ng/dl, respectively.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. The {{cause of}} {{the largest number of}} faults on the Eskom main {{transmission}} system is unknown. It is believed that a non-uniform pollution layer along an insulator string is the reason for these anomalous flashovers. This non-uniform pollution layer results in the highest electric field strength, and thus the highest voltage, across the cleanest and <b>driest</b> <b>discs.</b> There thus exists a strong possibility that the anomalous flashover phenomenon is caused by a combination of mechanisms involving the pollution and air breakdown flashover mechanisms. This research project attempted to prove that flashover of the insulators is possible in accordance with the above model. Various experiments were set up in the high voltage laboratory and at a natural test site with a low source impedance supply attempting to simulate the conditions that lead to flashover in accordance with the hypothesis. All the tests done have not proven the non-uniform light pollution flashover mechanism successfully. However, future research has proposed an air breakdown flashover mechanism in light pollution conditions where the polluted part of the insulator string has a specific non-uniform distribution. Full scale testing in conditions similar to the normal operating conditions is proposed to prove the validity of this new hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|Summary: An immunofiltration {{technique}} for the semiquantitative assay of {{human chorionic gonadotropin}} (hCG) was applied in two versions, using different antibodies. One anti- hCG subunit was immobilized on a glass microfibre disc {{in the form of}} six radially located bars, and the <b>dry</b> <b>disc</b> was placed on a water-absorbing material in a plastic device. A second antibody labelled with horse radish peroxidase conjugate was used in solution. For the colour reaction a solution with tetramethylbenzidine and hydrogen peroxide was used. The number of blue bars appearing on the test disc depended on concentration range of human chorionic gonadotropin. The technique with the monoclonal antibodies, anti- hCG and anti-ahCG-horse radish per-oxidase conjugate, was specific for intact human chorionic gonadotropin, while the technique with the rabbit antibodies, raised against synthetic fragment 122 - 145 - hCG and hCG-horse radish peroxidase, was useful for both intact human chorionic gonadotropin and its-chain. Cross reactions with human lutropin and thyrotropin were negligible. Haemoglobin, urea and various tested drugs did not affect the assay. In the assay of human chorionic gonadotropin in the urine of pregnant women and in sera of patients with trophoblastic diseases, the results from the immunofiltration technique were in accordance with data obtained by classical ELISA and by two commercial kits.

Apple discs variety "Gold Rush" were pre-treated and dried in laboratory tray drier at drying temperature 70 °C and at airflow velocity of 1. 5 ms- 1. Different chemical pre-treatments were applied on apple discs (dipping in 0. 5 % ascorbic acid solution; 0. 3 % L–cysteine solution; 0. 1 % 4 –hexyl resorcinol solution and 1 % sodium metabisulphite solution). Mean values of colour parameters, colour changes and correlation coefficients for apple discs were calculated for both colour models. The analysis showed statistically significant influence of pre-treatment method on total colour changes for both chosen colour models of dried apples.

40|$|Salmonella organisms of {{an unknown}} {{serotype}} are inoculated {{in the center of}} a motility agar plate, and paper discs impregnated with antiflagellar antisera are placed in the periphery of the plate. The plate is incubated at room temperature overnight. During this time, the bacteria spread in a widening circle toward the discs, while the antiserum from each disc, in turn, diffuses centrifugally. When the motile organisms encounter an antiserum reacting with their flagella, they are immobilized. A semicircular line of immobilization is noted around the reactive antiserum disc. Eleven different Salmonella isolates were typed in duplicate by a standard method and by the immuno-immobilization method. Results obtained by the two methods were essentially identical. Simultaneously, single phases were isolated from the zone between the immobilization line and its antiserum disc. Isolates from this region were of the phase not immobilized by the antiserum <b>disc.</b> The <b>dried</b> <b>discs,</b> prepared in tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane buffer and stored at 4 C, were stable for at least 5 months.

Carbenoxolone sodium, which is used for the treatment of aphthous ulcers in oral cavity, was used as a model drug. The pectin buccal discs were prepared by direct compression. The water uptake and erosion of pectin disc increased progressively with the swelling time. The bioadhesion of <b>dried</b> pectin <b>discs</b> decreased when either the discs were hydrated or the buccal tissue was wet with a small volume of medium.

The results demonstrated that buccal discs prepared from pectin with a high degree of esterification (DE) showed a weaker and more friable characteristic than that with low DE. Decreasing pectin to lactose ratio resulted in the high dissolution rate with low bioadhesive properties. Addition of sweetener in the formulations also affected the hardness, friability, and bioadhesive properties of the discs.

40|$|Increased {{levels of}} blood glucose are {{associated}} with the vascular complications of diabetes. Microvascular complications lead to delayed wound healing in patients suffering from diabetes. Hypoxia and hyperglycaemia characterise a wound environment of a person with diabetes. Angiogenesis is central to restore the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the wounded tissue. Endothelial cell migration is central to angiogenesis which is aided by hypoxia and attenuated by hyperglycaemia. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the disruption to angiogenesis of diabetic wounds are not completely understood. The effect of hypoxia and/or high glucose concentration on the endothelial cell migration in vitro was studied and an anti-oxidant, silymarin formulated as freeze <b>dried</b> wafer <b>discs</b> was tested for its beneficial effect. A radial migration and a wound healing assay were developed, validated and used to assess the effect of hypoxia and/or high glucose concentration on the migration of human endothelial cells of dermal origin. Circular and semi-circular monolayers of endothelial cells were used for the measurement of the migration by radial migration and wound healing assay respectively. Net migration was calculated by subtracting the radii at a specified time point from that measured at time zero. The migration was studied under normal (20 %) or below (5 %) normal oxygen tension in combination with normal (5 mM) or high (20 mM) glucose concentration. Endothelial cells were treated with an anti-proliferative agent, intracellular signal inhibitors and silymarin. Results demonstrated that hypoxia and high glucose concentration have opposing effects of increase (p< 0. 001) and decrease (p< 0. 001) respectively on the migration of endothelial cells. The results of the wound healing assay revealed that re-endothelialisation occurs faster (p< 0. 001) than endothelialisation. The effects of hypoxia and high glucose concentration appeared to be mediated via PI 3 K-Akt and PKCβII pathways respectively. Further investigations revealed the possibility of HIF- 1 α being involved in both the pathways. High glucose concentration-induced decrease in cell migration was successfully restored (p< 0. 001) by the use of an anti-oxidant silymarin. This could be due to anti-oxidant activity of silymarin on glucose-induced overproduction of reactive oxygen species. Silymarin formulated as freeze <b>dried</b> wafer <b>discs,</b> sterilised by gamma irradiation was successful in retaining its effect (p< 0. 001) against the high glucose impaired cell migration compared to control wafers. In conclusion, delayed wound healing due to disrupted endothelial cell migration was reaffirmed to be due to elevated glucose concentration. Silymarin was successful in restoring glucose-induced attenuation of cell migration. Freeze dried wafers show promising potential as a topical application for the treatment of chronic wounds for people with diabetes.
