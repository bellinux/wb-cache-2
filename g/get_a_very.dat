500|$|Lynch {{described}} {{the attractiveness of}} the idea of a pilot, despite the knowledge that the medium of television would be constricting: [...] "I'm a sucker for a continuing story... Theoretically, you can <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> deep story and you can go so deep and open the world so beautifully, but it takes time to do that." [...] The story included normal and surreal elements, much like Lynch's earlier series Twin Peaks. Groundwork was laid for story arcs, such as the mystery of Rita's identity, Betty's career and Adam Kesher's film project.|$|E
500|$|Following the match, referee Nicolae Rainea {{explained}} {{his decision to}} play the match despite heavy fog: [...] "When I went out there before kick-off I decided I could see well enough and so I decided to play. I am afraid many spectators would not <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> clear view {{but there was no}} time I had any thoughts of abandoning the game." [...] Liverpool manager Bob Paisley was critical of the decision to play the match: [...] "You can't play football in conditions like that, it's ridiculous." [...] Paisley suggested the competition should be played in April when the weather was better: [...] "I think a match like this, between two leading team should be played in better weather, say in April. I know it's difficult, but it's farcical when good players like these have to slither about in fog and can't see each other." ...|$|E
500|$|GamePro did {{not find}} the game worthy of its name, {{although}} the cutscenes were praised, stating, [...] "The cinemas {{at the opening of}} the game and between each level are stunning; however, the game graphics, particularly buildings and enemies, are lackluster at best. The sound effects are bland, and there are no weapon power-ups to be found. Put that all together and you <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> generic game." [...] Next Generation criticized the game for being tedious, but recognized that it is still an enjoyable game. Computer and Video Games offered similar criticism, declaring that [...] "it was too repetitive to become anything more than a good game." [...] Edge criticized the gameplay features such as camera control and boss difficulty. Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewers criticized the game for its easy bosses and its repetitive and short gameplay value. Famitsu liked the battles but complained about the Fuchikoma attaching to walls when not intended.|$|E

500|$|At the Dunphy house, Phil (Ty Burrell) and Claire (Julie Bowen) {{decide to}} have a small dinner for Valentine's Day {{in order to avoid}} the {{disastrous}} results of the events of last year. Since they only could <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> early dinner reservation, Claire realizes that all the couples are elderly so she decides to bring back their characters from last year, Clive Bixby and Julianna. Julianna has Clive ditch his wife and meet her at their hotel. At the bar, Claire gives Phil the key to her room. While watching Claire walk way, Phil takes the wrong room key belonging to an older woman who was arranging her purse. He enters the wrong room, sprinkles rose petals on the bed, undresses, and waits on the bed with a bottle of champagne. The older woman then walks in after coming back from the bar. Back at the house, Phil and Claire decide to just act like themselves.|$|E
500|$|Variety {{was added}} to the city itself, as certain areas were {{designed}} around the villains that control that particular territory. Dax Ginn, marketing game manager at Rocksteady Games, said, [...] "If you move into Joker's territory, you <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> Joker-ized experience, and all the artwork on the buildings– whether that's graffiti, signage, or whatever it might be– gives you a dense kind of Joker experience. So our art team has really put a lot of effort in making that sort of transition between one turf zone to another– really helping the player feel like they're making a physical transition into another emotional space." [...] The architecture was imbued with 19th century Art Nouveau design, such as Strange's Wonder Tower which was inspired by the Eiffel Tower, while character designs employed a modern Hyperrealism style. To keep the environments interesting, base color schemes such as Mr Freeze's ice-themed area, Joker's fire-themed steel mill, and Poison Ivy's jungle-themed area were populated with contrasting elements: for example, the steel mill uses large, white clown faces to contrast the oranges and reds used throughout. To develop the expanded environment of Arkham City and build a [...] "natural urban environment" [...] for Batman, Rocksteady expanded its workforce from 75 to over 100 people.|$|E
500|$|Reactions to the {{transmissions}} were mixed. Many fans {{felt the}} transmissions disrupted {{the flow of}} the concerts. Most of the British press was highly critical. One writer for NME wrote, [...] "The Bosnian linkup was beyond bad taste. It was insulting." [...] Bono thought that they were bringing the public's attention to an important event, though he admitted that the link-ups were the most difficult thing the band had done in their career. Guitarist The Edge said, [...] "We don't normally see that kind of cold hard news. We <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> sanitized, editorialized take on everything... When you watch the television news, you are getting something palatable, whereas this was really quite unpalatable most of the time. And for that reason I think it affected people very much, including us." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. During a transmission from the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo asked what the band intended to do to help before telling Bono, [...] "We know you're {{not going to do anything}} for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die." [...] During a transmission to a Glasgow concert, a Bosnian woman told the concert audience, [...] "We would like to hear the music, too, but we hear only the screams of wounded and tortured people and raped women." [...] Some people were upset by the circumstances of Sarajevo and were motivated to join the War Child charity project, including U2 producer Brian Eno. Despite U2's obligation to the tour and their inability to perform in Sarajevo during the war, they vowed to play the city someday.|$|E

2500|$|At AirVenture in July 2008, new Eclipse CEO Roel Pieper {{confirmed}} that if sufficient orders were placed for the 400, production would commence in 2011.

It {{will not be}} allowed to influence the 500 in any way." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that the James–Stein estimator dominates the usual estimator for any ν. [...] A natural question to ask is whether the improvement over the usual estimator is independent of the choice of ν. [...] The answer is no. The improvement is small if [...] is large. [...] Thus to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> great improvement some knowledge of the location of θ is necessary. [...] Of course this is the quantity we are trying to estimate so we don't have this knowledge a priori. [...] But we may have some guess as to what the mean vector is. [...] This can be considered a disadvantage of the estimator: the choice is not objective as it may depend on the beliefs of the researcher.|$|E

2500|$|Piano tuners, harp {{makers and}} the {{builders}} and restorers of early instruments, e.g. harpsichords, use high-end tuners {{to assist with}} their tuning and instrument building. Even piano tuners who work mostly [...] "by ear" [...] may use an electronic tuner to tune just a first key on the piano, e. g. the a' to 440Hz, after which they proceed by means of octaves, approximate fifths and approximate fourths to tune the others. (In the twelve-tone equal temperament system dominant in classical and Western music, all intervals except the octave are slightly [...] "mistuned" [...] or compromised compared to more consonant just intervals.) They may also use electronic tuners to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> out-of-tune piano roughly in pitch, after which point they tune by ear. Electronic tuning devices for keyboard instruments are for various reasons generally much more complex and therefore expensive than {{in the case of}} other widely used instruments.|$|E
