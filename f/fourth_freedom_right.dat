50|$|The {{third and}} <b>fourth</b> <b>freedoms</b> allow basic {{international}} service between two countries. Even when reciprocal third and <b>fourth</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>rights</b> are granted, air services agreements (e.g. the Bermuda Agreements) may still restrict {{many aspects of}} the traffic, such as the capacity of aircraft, the frequency of flights, the airlines permitted to fly and the airports permitted to be served. The third <b>freedom</b> is the <b>right</b> to carry passengers or cargo from one's own country to another. The right to carry passengers or cargo from another country to one's own is the <b>fourth</b> <b>freedom.</b> Third and <b>fourth</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>rights</b> are almost always granted simultaneously in bilateral agreements between countries.|$|R
40|$|The air {{transport}} regime, {{which was established}} under Bermuda I-type agreements, has been altered {{during the last two}} decades through the liberalization of international {{air transport}}. International air transport liberalization was initiated by the domestic deregulation of the US. After that, the US began exporting its liberalization policy to the international air transport market through liberal bilateral agreements. Since the early- 1990 's, the US has concluded numerous open skies agreements. Corresponding with the US liberalization policy, the EC initiated its regional liberalization and the EU achieved a fully open aviation market within the EU region through three liberalization packages. While liberalization of air transport has been proceeding in the international market, Japan was seeking to amend the Japan-US Civil Air Transport Agreement of 1952, which was modeled on Bermuda I. The development of Japanese and US carriers made the agreement unsuitable for the reality of the Japan-US market. At the same time, the ambiguous capacity clauses of the agreement caused serious interpretive disputes. Japan was seeking a restrictive agreement while the US desired an open skies agreement. It became evident during air transport negotiations. Japan and the US concluded an interim agreement in January 1998. The agreement of 1998 grants six carriers (three carriers for each country) unlimited third and <b>fourth</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>rights</b> and greatly liberalizes fifth <b>freedom</b> <b>rights.</b> The agreement also guarantees other Japan and US carriers very liberal third and <b>fourth</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>rights</b> and some limited fifth <b>freedom</b> <b>rights.</b> Furthermore, the agreement permits code-sharing in the Japan-US market for the first time. Although the two countries managed to reach on agreement, Japan must amend the Japanese Aviation Act for more efficient code-sharing between Japan and US carriers and solve its serious airport congestion problem in order to expand services under the new agreement...|$|R
50|$|The Japan-United States {{bilateral}} {{air transport}} agreement of 1952 {{has been viewed}} as being particularly contentious, because unlimited fifth <b>freedom</b> traffic <b>rights</b> have been granted to designated US air carriers serving destinations in the Asia Pacific region west of Japan. For example, in the early 1990s, the Japanese government's refusal to permit flights on the New York City—Osaka—Sydney route led to protests by the US government and the airlines that applied to serve that route. The Japanese government countered that about 10% of the traffic on the Japan - Australia sector was third and <b>fourth</b> <b>freedom</b> traffic {{to and from the}} US, while the bilateral agreement specified that primary justification for unlimited fifth freedom traffic was to fill up aircraft carrying a majority of US-originated or US-destined traffic under third and <b>fourth</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>rights.</b> Japan had held many unused fifth <b>freedom</b> traffic <b>rights</b> beyond the USA. However, these were seen as being less valuable than the fifth <b>freedom</b> traffic <b>rights</b> enjoyed by US air carriers via Japan, because of the higher operating costs of Japanese airlines and geographical circumstances. Japan serves as a useful gateway to Asia for North American travelers. The US contended that Japan's favourable geographical location and its flag airlines' carriage of a sizeable volume of sixth freedom traffic via gateway cities in Japan helped to level the playing field. In 1995, the air transport agreement was updated by way of liberalizing Japanese carriers' access to US destinations, while placing selected restrictions on US air carriers.|$|R

50|$|The ASEAN-SAM is {{expected}} to fully liberalize air travel between member states in the ASEAN region, allowing ASEAN countries and airlines operating {{in the region to}} directly benefit from the growth in air travel around the world, and also freeing up tourism, trade, investment, and service flows between member states. Since 1 December 2008, restrictions on the third and <b>fourth</b> <b>freedoms</b> of the air between capital cities of member states for air passengers services have been removed, while from 1 January 2009, full liberalization of air freight services in the region took effect.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the <b>freedom</b> <b>rights,</b> {{the nature of the}} rights to human dignity, to life, and not to be discriminated against, or the right to a fair trial, does not permit them to be waived: “Unlike the <b>freedom</b> <b>rights,</b> these rights cannot be exercised negatively.” The <b>right</b> to <b>freedom</b> of expression, for example, can be exercised by keeping quiet, but the right to dignity cannot be exercised by being abused. One cannot therefore assume that the right is exercised when it is waived (as one can, subject to the above considerations, with the <b>freedom</b> <b>rights).</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{unofficial}} {{sixth freedom}} combines {{the third and}} <b>fourth</b> <b>freedoms</b> and {{is the right to}} carry passengers or cargo from a second country to a third country by stopping in one's own country. It can also be characterized as a form of the fifth freedom with an intermediate stop in the operating airline's home market. This characterization is often invoked as protectionist policy as the traffic, like fifth freedom traffic, is secondary in nature to third and <b>fourth</b> <b>freedom</b> traffic. Consequently, some nations seek to regulate sixth freedom traffic as though it were fifth freedom traffic. China {{is an example of a}} country that restricts sixth freedom traffic from third party countries. Specifically, it is difficult for airlines to obtain permission from China to serve the country via codeshare flights from intermediate countries.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This article {{demonstrates}} that socioeconomic development, emancipative cultural change and democratization constitute a coherent syndrome of social progress – a syndrome whose common focus {{has not been}} properly specified by classical modernization theory. We specify this syndrome as ‘human development’, arguing that its three components have a common focus on broadening human choice. Socioeconomic development gives people the objective means of choice by increasing individual resources; rising emancipative values strengthen people’s subjective orientation towards choice; and democratization provides legal guarantees of choice by institutionalizing <b>freedom</b> <b>rights.</b> Analysis of data from the World Values Surveys {{demonstrates that}} the linkage between individual resources, emancipative values and <b>freedom</b> <b>rights</b> is universal in its presence across nations, regions and cultural zones; that this human development syndrome is shaped by a causal effect of individual resources and emancipative values on freedom rights; and that this effect operates through its impact on elite integrity, as the factor which makes <b>freedom</b> <b>rights</b> effective...|$|R
