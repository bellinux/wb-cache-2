40|$|Abstract. The helix is {{a complex}} {{geometrical}} element. During the process of a dynamical measurement of the helical deviations, many factors, including the machine and the environment, lead to measurement errors. Although ISO as well as national standards stipulate the tolerances and assessment methods for helical deviations, these standards contribute little to the uncertainty calculations concerning such measurements. According to the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM), all measurement results must have a stated uncertainty associated to them. But in most cases of helical <b>deviation</b> <b>measurements,</b> no uncertainty value is given, simply because no measurement uncertainty calculation procedure exists. For the case of helical <b>deviation</b> <b>measurements</b> on a Computer Numeric Control (CNC) polar coordinate machine, this paper analyses in detail all kinds of factors contributing to the measurement uncertainty, and gives the calculation procedure of the measurement uncertainty of helical deviation. As an example, the calculation of the measurement uncertainty of the helical deviations of a worm is presented...|$|R

The emergence of home health care or home care (HHC/HC) service mode provides an alternative for elderly care. How to develop and apply this new mobile service mode is crucial for the government. Therefore, the pertinent optimization problems regarding HHC/HC have constantly {{attracted the attention of}} researchers. Unexpected events, such as new requests of customers, cancellations of customers’ services, and changes of customers’ time windows, may occur during the process of executing an a priori visiting plan.

40|$|Regarding {{gear tooth}} shape {{measurement}} and the uncertainty evaluation method Gear tooth shape deviation {{can be divided}} into three types: profile deviations, helix deviations, and pitch deviations. Fig. 1 represents the principle behind gear <b>deviation</b> <b>measurement.</b> In all of the deviation measurements, measurement values are obtained from the y-position of the stylus. Therefore, the y-position of the stylus represents the output quantity. Other quantities (stylus x-position, stylus z-position, and gear tooth surface position) represent the input quantities. Accordingly, if we search for a point on the gear tooth surface whose x-coordinate and z-coordinate are equal to x- and z-position of the stylus, the y-coordinate of the gear tooth surface should be equal to the y-position of the stylus. We can apply the Monte Carlo method to this procedure, thus evaluating the gear tooth shape measurement uncertainty. The factors of the uncertainties being considered are shown in Table 1, and the simulation conditions are listed in Table 2. Except for the length measurement uncertainty (y-direction), the uncertainty factors ar...|$|E

A charge-coupled device (CCD) gives much more information of a laser beam than a PSD.

In this paper a performance comparison between a PSD and a CCD combined with a centroid algorithm are discussed with special attention paid to the CCD-based system. According to the operating principle of the CCD-based system, several experiments were carried out to evaluate five factors of the CCD-based system: image window size, number of processed images, threshold, binning, and saturation. By applying the optimized parameters, several experiments were made to compare the CCD-based system with the state-of-the-art PSD-based system in terms of two performance indicators, namely resolution and speed. It is shown that, by applying the optimized parameters, {{the performance of a}} CCD-based system is comparable to that of a PSD-based system in measuring laser beam deviation...|$|E

40|$|The {{analyses}} of the national reforms in the welfare states over the last decades were partly focused on this notion of convergence. In the eighties and the nineties, the transformation in many welfare states provided a literature on the retrenchment of the welfare states which explained the trends as a bottom race or a downward convergence. The economic literature has provided a large range of measurements of convergence in per capita GDP between countries. These indicators have mainly been based on the <b>deviation</b> <b>measurement</b> (σ-convergence), the differences between growth rates (β-convergence), or {{the changes in the}} ranks of countries (γ-convergence). The analyses on the convergence/ divergence in the social welfare states often used the same indicators as in economic studies. In this exploratory paper we would like to re-think the measurement of convergence on the basis of attractiveness between pairs of countries because many national reforms have been inspired by the existence of specific policies in some leading countries which became 'models' for the other ones. This paper proposes a methodology for distinguishing the countries which are attracted by some other ones, from the countries which are attractors (models).

Findings indicate that Central Asian currencies significantly deviate in terms of other Central Asian currencies. Furthermore, nominal and real deviation indicators signal that the trends vary in both the scales and directions. Thus, these measurements can be utilized for enhancing coordinated exchange rate policies among Central Asia...|$|E
