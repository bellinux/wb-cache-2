5|$|Stephen's cult emerged {{after the}} long period of anarchy characterizing the rule of <b>his</b> <b>immediate</b> successors.

5|$|As {{the poem}} continues, the narrator begins to focus {{less on the}} {{countryside}} and more on <b>his</b> <b>immediate</b> surroundings. His descriptions move from sensations to his own thoughts as he begins to emphasise what is not present in the scene; he contrasts an obscure country life with a life that is remembered. This contemplation provokes the narrator's thoughts on the natural process of wastage and unfulfilled potential.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{created a}} public {{image as a}} celibate man without a {{domestic}} life, dedicated entirely to his political mission and the nation. He met his lover, Eva Braun, in 1929, and married her in April 1945. In September 1931, his half-niece, Geli Raubal, took her own life with Hitler's gun in his Munich apartment. It was rumoured among contemporaries that Geli was in a romantic relationship with him, and her death {{was a source of}} deep, lasting pain.

5|$|Morrow urged {{enforcement}} of state laws against carrying concealed weapons and restricted {{activities of the}} Ku Klux Klan. During {{his first year in}} office, he granted only 100 pardons.

5|$|Royal {{government}} in England had traditionally centred on several great offices of state, filled by powerful, independent {{members of the}} baronage. Henry abandoned this policy, leaving the post of justiciar vacant and turning the position of chancellor into a more junior role. A small royal council was formed but its role was ill-defined; appointments, patronage, and policy were decided personally by Henry and <b>his</b> <b>immediate</b> advisers, rather than through the larger councils that had marked his early years. The changes made it much harder for those outside Henry's inner circle to influence policy or to pursue legitimate grievances, particularly against the King's friends.|$|E
5|$|Suharto's {{upbringing}} {{contrasts with}} that of leading Indonesian nationalists such as Sukarno in that he {{is believed to have}} had little interest in anti-colonialism, or political concerns beyond <b>his</b> <b>immediate</b> surroundings.

He learned to speak Dutch after his induction into the Dutch military in 1940.|$|E
