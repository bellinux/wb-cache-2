40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} use of {{electrostatic}} capacitive probes for detections and evaluations of dielectric material properties and flaws. Interest in using both inductive and capacitive arrays for proximity sensing, surface feature characterization, material properties evaluation, and flaw detecting has increased steadily since the mid- 1980 ’s [1 – 7]. Two other papers [6, 7] in this proceedings also discuss {{the present state of}} the art, particularly with regard to the measurement of lossy dielectrics (complex permittivity). In traditional <b>dielectrometry</b> measurements (as well as in eddy-current measurements of material properties evaluation) varying the probe frequency has long been used as a tool for extracting information about dispersion and loss mechanisms. Use of a spatially periodic array probe interrogates the material, or flaw, with a field that penetrates into the sample to a degree determined by the periodicity. This controllable penetration phenomenon (artificial-skin effect or zoom effect) has been successfully exploited by Melcher, Zaretsky [5], and Goldfine [6] in what they call imposed w-k magnetometry and <b>dielectrometry,</b> using interdigital probes of different periodicities.

Design/methodology/approach: used involves measurements of effective dielectric permittivity (and other effective dielectric quantities) by means of interdigit <b>dielectrometry.</b> Fringe measuring electric field was applied to BaTiO 3 micro-powder by interdigit comb sensor (ICS) Netzsch of Ms 25 type. ICS was driven by measuring generator with sinusoidal voltage: v(t) = VDC+VACsin(ωt), within frequency range 20 Hz- 100 kHz and for DC-Bias values ranging as VDC=(0 - 20) V. Findings: The interdigit <b>dielectrometry</b> was applied to measure complex dielectric permittivity, complex dielectric modulus and others dielectric functions of ferroelectric BaTiO 3 powder. The influence of constant component of electric stimulus was investigated in the frequency range 100 kHz to 20 Hz. It was established that in the low frequency range constant component of electric field enhances effective dielectric permittivity, and changes two weak relaxation processes occurring in the ferroelectric micro-granular net. It turned out that effective dielectric complex modulus of this net is most sensitive quantity for application of constant component of electric stimulus.

40|$|Paper {{insulated}} lead covered (PILC) cables {{have played}} an important role in underground power distribution for a hundred years. Replacing aged PILC before failure is critical to managing power distribution. Three prominent failure mechanisms accelerate cable aging: temperature stresses, moisture ingress, and partial discharge. The research focuses on the effect of temperature and moisture on the effective (complex) permittivity of the cable insulation. Measurements are performed using cylindrical <b>dielectrometry</b> sensors designed to be wrapped around the cable. The lead sheath of the cable is removed so that the sensors can be placed directly in contact with the insulation. From the measurements, the electrical properties of the material as a function of temperature and transient moisture diffusion are found. A theoretical treatment of the interdigital <b>dielectrometry</b> sensors with a cylindrical geometry is presented. Two classes of the geometry are studied. The periodic sensor geometry has electrodes aligned with the cylindrical axis and periodic around the circumference. The z periodic sensor geometry has the electrodes forming rings around the cylinder that are periodic along the cylindrical axis. The material is modeled by concentric rings of homogeneous materials. The electric field solution consists of an infinite summation of Fourier series terms. In finding the field solution and as a consequence of it, the potential, electric field lines, and the impedance between the driving and sensing electrodes are found. A generalized solution to the planar <b>dielectrometry</b> sensor topology is also presented. This solution allows for an arbitrary placement and excitation of electrodes, providing the analytical tools for a new generation of sensors. (cont.) <b>Dielectrometry</b> sensors for use in and z periodic geometries are designed and manufactured on a 4 mil PTFE substrate. An experimental setup is designed and built to provide a temperature and humidity controlled environment for measurements. Special clamping mechanisms are used to secure the sensor to the sample. Custom built hardware is used to excite the sensor at frequencies ranging from 0. 005 Hz to 10, 000 Hz (over six decades), measure and record the response, and deliver it to a computer for storage and analysis. Steady state measurements are performed at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 100 C. Plastics, woods, and the PILC cable samples are measured. Using the theoretical model, the effective permittivity is estimated from the measurements. An Arrhenius temperature dependence is observed for several materials including the PILC cables. We characterize the temperature dependence of these materials by a master curve and activation energy. Together they give a complete description of the effective permittivity's frequency and temperature dependence. Transient measurements of moisture diffusion are made at constant temperatures for several materials. For some experiments the boundary conditions limit the diffusion of moisture to one direction. When the z periodic sensor is used, six independent measurements are taken along the direction of diffusion. From the initial and final conditions and the theoretical model, a mapping between the electrical properties and the insulation moisture content is formed. Moisture concentration along the direction of diffusion is estimated and in some cases characterized by a simple diffusion coefficient. (cont.) The diffusion experiments provide evidence that moisture can move rapidly through the stranded conductors of the cables, delivering moisture to locations far removed from an initial breach. The experimental results show the electrical properties of the cable insulation is highly sensitive to the presence of moisture and changes in temperature. While using these sensors for field measurements may not be practical because they require the cable sheath to be removed, the technology provides a valuable, low cost tool for assessing cable health in an off-line setting. by Zachary M.

The reaction rate constant is unaffected by pressures above 120 bar but close to the critical pressure the value decreases with increasing pressure. It is also shown that the product distribution for the alkylation of anisole shows significant pressure dependence with substitution at the ortho-position being favored at lower pressures, which is ascribed to hydrogen bonding. This pressure dependency is not observed in sc CO 2 or using toluene as a substrate, which supports the idea that hydrogen bonding may be important in the reaction mechanism.

40|$|The {{presence}} of moisture in a transformer deteriorates the transformer insulation by decreasing its electrical, mechanical, and thermal strength. Therefore, {{it is important}} to monitor the moisture condition in both liquid and solid insulation to assure transformer performance. There are commercially available sensors to measure the moisture in oil. When the transformer system is in equilibrium, moisture partitioning curves for the oil-paper system can be used to find the moisture in paper from the oil measurement. A comprehensive study of the classic moisture equilibrium curves is given, historical mistakes are corrected, and all relevant concepts are clarified. This research serves as a useful tool to utilities and manufacturers. A new set of moisture equilibrium curves is constructed for moisture in oil up to the saturation moisture content. A measurement technique exploiting the linearity between the relative humidity of the oil and the moisture content of the oil to indirectly measure the oil solubility is developed. Solubility tests are performed for differently conditioned oils: Fresh Shell Diala AX oil, lab-aged Shell Diala A oil, used oil from Ramapo Substation, and used oil from Texas Utilities. Results show that aging under normal operation at service temperature is not very likely to significantly change the water solubility. When the system is not in equilibrium, the equilibrium moisture curves are not applicable and the three-wavelength interdigital <b>dielectrometry</b> sensor developed at the MIT Laboratory for Electromagnetic and Electronic Systems provides a unique way to measure the spatial profile of the moisture distribution in transformer pressboard. (cont.) reduces the problems associated with the previous design and simplifies the inversion algorithm to convert the sensor signal to dielectric properties. The thesis focuses on the design and implementation of experimental studies based on interdigital <b>dielectrometry</b> using the new three-wavelength sensor. As a first step to relate measurable dielectric properties to absorbed moisture, the moisture and temperature effects on the dielectric spectrum of oil-free pressboard are measured using a parallel-plate electrode sensor for nine moisture levels and five temperature levels. A dielectric model for biological tissue is adopted here for cellulose structured pressboard. A universal curve is found relating dielectric properties to moisture concentration and temperature by fitting the data to the model. Preliminary measurements of oil-impregnated pressboard show similar characteristics. The moisture diffusion process in oil-free transformer pressboard is monitored using the new interdigital <b>dielectrometry</b> three-wavelength sensor in a specially constructed bench-top apparatus. Experiments are performed for five different temperatures at various moisture levels. The time evolution of the moisture spatial profile in transformer pressboard is non-destructively estimated. Experimental results show good agreement with theoretical analysis of the moisture diffusion equation on the effects of moisture level, pressboard thickness, and temperature on the diffusion process. The diffusion coefficient for oil-free pressboard as a function of temperature and moisture concentration is estimated. Numerical algorithms for solving the non-linear diffusion equation arederived. Literature results of the diffusion coefficient for cellulose insulation are compared and analyzed. The interdigital sensor setup is also combined in a transformer oil Couette Facility that simulates the transformer environment for studying temperatureand moisture transients in pressboard. The understanding of moisture-related processes in power transformers can be enhancedwith this methodology. Finally, a newly promoted in-situ time-domain measurement technique is implemented using the Tettex Recovery Voltage Meter. Time domain measurements are performed for oil-impregnated pressboard in both parallel-plate andcoaxial cylinder electrode geometries (the Couette Facility). The results for temperature and aging effects show good agreementwith theory. by Yanqing Du. Thesis (Ph. D.)

In the case of oil filled transformers, condition monitoring methods based on dissolved gas analysis, polarization studies, partial discharge studies, frequency response analysis studies to check the mechanical integrity, IR heat monitoring and other vibration monitoring techniques are in use. In the current research program, studies have been initiated to identify the degradation of insulating materials by the electrical relaxation technique known as <b>dielectrometry.</b> Aging leads to main degradation products like moisture and other oxidized products due to fluctuating thermal and electrical loading. By applying repetitive low frequency high voltage sine wave perturbations in the range of 100 to 200 V peak across available terminals of power transformer, the conductive and polarization parameters of insulation aging are identified. An in-house novel digital instrument is developed to record the low leakage response of repetitive polarization currents in three terminals configuration. The technique is tested with known three transformers of rating 5 kVA or more. The effects of stressing polarization voltage level, polarizing wave shapes and various terminal configurations provide characteristic aging relaxation information. By using different analyses, sensitive parameters of aging are identified and it is presented in this thesis...|$|E
40|$|Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) are {{the most}} {{developed}} and commonly known facets of Magnetic Resonance (MR). This work explores compact MR strategies so that new directions for MRI and MRS may arise in the future. This thesis {{is divided into three}} parts, namely, Devices, Methodologies, and Investigations. Ten relaxometry devices are developed in Part I. Three devices are single sided while seven are closed sensors. Single sided sensors include the worlds smallest single sided sensor the S$^ 4 $~MOUSE comparable to the old generation NMR-MOUSE but over 126 times smaller. Other single sided sensors include the $^{ 23 }$Na NMR-MOUSE and the next generation Fourier NMR-MOUSE. Closed magnets include the worlds smallest $ 0. 6 $~cm$^ 3 $ NMR probe that includes the magnets, noise shielding, the NMR coil, and the sample tube. Other prominent closed sensors include $ 1. 6 $~cm$^ 3 $ 1 T NMR probe including magnets and a palm-top $^ 2 $H sensor. New geometries are developed with different shimming strategies to achieve relaxometry, one of the strategies is now a patent. Part II of this work deals with simulation of 1 D NMR signal based on stretched exponential approach and also implements a 2 D correlation method `CPMG SWIET' to measure $D$-$T_ 2 $ maps suitable for low SNR conditions. This part ends with a chapter on future methods, procedures, and strategies to move towards spectroscopy and elucidates a geometry with imaging-level homogeneity without prior shimming. Simulations of a 10 Tesla pineapple-sized magnet and 2 D polarized magnet assemblies, and an idea of moving magnets to homogenize the field, among others, are key future directions for compact NMR. Part III deals with investigations performed using the NMR-MOUSE and its comparison with competitive techniques such as THz imaging and evanescent field <b>dielectrometry...</b>|$|E
40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} was a {{practical}} approval whether fringe field interdigit <b>dielectrometry</b> (FFID) can beuseful for sensible monitoring of water molecules behavior within granular-starch-population sample during it’shumidification process. Design/methodology/approach: used was to design methodology and perform series of measurementsinvolving calibration of a measuring system, sample preparation and to record initial stage of starch-granulespopulationsamples humidification process as dielectric parameters response on the step of ambient atmosphererelative humidity (~ 0 to ~ 100 %) at room temperature. Findings: it was found that FFID enables to follow and isolate new features and characteristic stages of watervapors behavior during humidification of vacuum- dried starch granules population. The measurement of dielectricproperties of freely stacked granules population with unperturbed inter-granular contacts areas differs from the one,during which this contacts are being broken. Research limitations/implications: the possibility of new insight into humidification of micro-granularmatter sample (starch granules population). It implies the necessity of collective (of global scale) model of dielectricproperties creation. The evolution of dielectric permittivity is correlated with mass increase (water dipoles number) and adsorption rate as well as with absorption of water molecules within the granules population. Dielectric energylosses are correlated with evolution of interaction between water molecules and bio-polymeric matrix. Practical implications: huge amounts starch granules are produced transported and stored so properunderstanding of wheat response on humidity change is also of great practical importance. Originality/value: {{of this paper}} relays on the fact that FFID was applied {{for the first time to}} starch granulespopulation and it turned out to be effective tool in monitoring and modeling of dielectric properties of microgranularmatter population and for granular starch in particular. It is important in modeling of collective dielectricproperties of this kind of matter as well as of practical reasons specified above...|$|E

Design/methodology/approach: Polycrystalline samples of (Ba 0. 40 Sr 0. 60) TiO 3 (BS 60 T) were prepared by calcinations method at temperature 1570 K. Images of the morphology of the samples were taken by means of electron microscope Philips SEM 525 M at room temperature. Dielectric measurements were performed with application of Quatro Cryosystem 4. 0 Agilent Precision LRC meter HP 4824 A equipped with WinDETA 5. 62 software Novocontrol. Measurements were taken under cooling with 2 K/min speed. Measuring electric field frequency was from the range 20 Hz - 1 MHz. Findings: The <b>dielectrometry</b> was applied to measure complex dielectric permittivity and other dielectric functions of ferroelectric (BS 60 T). It was affirmed, that 60 % substitution of Sr ions changed the type of phase transition. Weak dependence of temperature Tm= 208 K (temperature of maximum electric permittivity ε’) on frequency of the external electric field testifies about diffused character of the phase transition (DPT). The polar character of this material was also observed in the paraelectric phase (to 360 K). This observation is connected with the occurrence of polar clusters in this phase. Research limitations/implications: Results can be used in order to describe the phase transition modifications in the solid solutions with ferroactive substitutions in sublattice B of the perovskite. Originality/value: Value of this work relies on the experimental examination of the electric properties of BS 60 T solid solution.

40|$|Interdigitated <b>dielectrometry</b> sensors (IDS) are {{capacitive}} sensors investigated {{to precisely}} measure the relative permittivity (ϵ r) of insulating liquids. Such liquids {{used in the}} power industry exhibit a change in ϵ r as they degrade. The IDS ability to measure ϵ r in-situ can potentially reduce maintenance, increase grid stability and improve safety. Noise from external electric field sources is a prominent issue with IDS. This paper investigates the novelty of applying a Faraday cage onto an IDS as a 3 D shield to reduce this noise. This alters the spatially distributed electric field of an IDS affecting its sensing properties. Therefore, dependency of the sensor’s signal with the distance to a shield above the IDS electrodes has been investigated experimentally and theoretically via a Green’s function calculation and FEM. A criteria of the shield’s distance s = s 0 {{has been defined as}} the distance which gives a capacitance for the IDS equal to 1 − e − 2 = 86. 5 % of its unshielded value. Theoretical calculations using a simplified geometry gave a constant value for s 0 / λ = 1. 65, where λ is the IDS wavelength. In the experiment, values for s 0 were found to be lower than predicted as from theory and the ratio s 0 / λ variable. This was analyzed in detail and it was found to be resulting from the specific spatial structure of the IDS. A subsequent measurement of a common insulating liquid with a nearby noise source demonstrates a considerable reduction in the standard deviation of the relative permittivity from σ unshielded = ± 9. 5 % to σ shielded = ± 0. 6 %. The presented findings enhance our understanding of IDS in respect to the influence of a Faraday shield on the capacitance, parasitic capacitances of the IDS and external noise impact on the measurement of ϵ r...|$|E

Design/methodology/approach: The polycrystalline samples of (Ba 0. 60 Sr 0. 40) TiO 3 and (Ba 0. 60 Sr 0. 40) Ti 0. 8 O 3 were obtained by the calcinations method in temperature 1620 K. The dielectric measurements were executed byautomatic device (QUATRO KRIO 4. 0 with LCR Agilent 4824 A meter and BDS 1100 cryostat). The materials wereinvestigated under cooling conditions with speed of 2 K/min and within frequency range from 20 Hz to 1 MHz. Findings: The <b>dielectrometry</b> was applied to measure complex dielectric permittivity and other dielectricfunctions of ferroelectric (Ba 0. 60 Sr 0. 40) TiO 3 (BST- 40) and (Ba 0. 60 Sr 0. 40) Ti 0. 8 O 3 (BST- 40 / 0. 8). It was affirmed, that 40 % substitution of Sr ions as well as 20 % deficiency of Ti ions in solid solution reduced temperature and changedthe type of phase transformation. The transformation stood strongly diffused. The weak dependence of temperatureTm (peak of electric permittivity ε’) from frequency of electric measuring field was observed. It means, that thismaterial should be prescribed to the class of ferroelectrics with diffused phase transformation (DPT). The polarcharacter of this solution was also observed in the paraelectric phase. It is connected with the occurrence of polarclusters in paraelectric phase. Practical implications: Results can be used to construct the model describing changes in the solid solutionswith ferroactive and nonferroactive substitutions in sublattice A or B of the perovskite.

40|$|The major {{objective}} of this thesis is to develop instrumentation and parameter estimation algorithms for nondestructive measurement of non-homogeneous material property profiles with fringing electric field <b>dielectrometry</b> sensors. The instrumentation includes interdigital sensors and sensor arrays, other types of fringing field sensors, electronic circuit boards for measurement of sensor signals, and mechanical setups for specific applications. The parameter estimation algorithms require solving forward and inverse problems of material property estimation. The forward problem implies calculation of the sensor admittance matrix {{as a function of}} geometry and material properties. The inverse problem, inherently more difficult than the forward problem, implies estimation of unknown geometry and material properties based on known properties and measured entries of the sensor admittance matrix. The developed instrumentation and algorithms are applied to practical problems which include mo++nitoring of moisture dynamics in transformer pressboard, evaluation of the saturation state of chemical garments, detection of flaws in fiberglass flywheels, and detection of buried metal and plastic landmines. The design strategy and fabrication practices are described for multiple penetration depth interdigital sensors designed for measurement of conductivity and permittivity of electrical insulation of power transformers. An extensive overview of interdigital electrode technology in other fields is given. A number of disturbance parameters that affect interdigital <b>dielectrometry</b> measurements is characterized and either eliminated or accounted for using empirical, analytical, and numerical simulation approaches. A new type of fringing field sensor has been developed to improve the cross-correlation between different fringing field patterns. In most cases, the forward problem has been solved using commercial finite-element software "Maxwell" by Ansoft Corp. Other methods, such as a co++ntinuum model, analytical expressions, and direct calibration were used for comparison and to achieve greater accuracy in simple cases. A family of algorithms for solving inverse problems has been developed to address different applications. (cont.) No single algorithm provides the most accurate and reliable results in all cases. The most appropriate algorithm for each given application should be chosen on the basis of required speed and accuracy, number of known and unknown parameters, type of distribution of material properties, contact conditions between the sensor head and the material, and a specific type of sensor selected for the task. Major types of property estimation algorithms include direct calibration; use of empirically and numerically determined approximations; use of pre-computed lookup tables; iterative guesses at dielectric and geometry properties while solving the minimization problem of matching theoretical and measured entries of sensor admittance matrix; direct mapping between the sensor output and the physical variable of interest (not necessarily a dielectric property);(cont.) pattern recognition in the dielectric spectroscopy signature; and search for signal characteristics in the sensor output due to material property variations. Each of these major types of algorithms has been implemented in one or more forms to achieve the desired results for each specific problem. One of the algorithmic approaches has been generalized to other types of problemsby implementing it as a generic optimization tool. Moisture dynamics in transformer pressboard has been studied extensively with numerical simulations of the forward and inverse problem. The developed algorithm has been applied to experimental dataobtained by another graduate student, Yanqing Du, in a concurrent Ph. D. thesis. It has been demonstrated that a three-wavelength interdigital sensor can be used to measure time-dependent continuous smoothly varying moisture profiles in oil-impregnated power transformer pressboard. Ultimately, this technology is capable of preventing partial discharges and transformer failures due to flow electrification and static charging of the oil-pressboard interface. Preliminary measurements also demonstrated adequate sensitivity and selectivity of fringing field sensors for the detection of flaws in fiberglass flywheels and detection and discrimination of buried plastic and metal landmines. The saturation state of chemical protective garments hasbeen determined for relatively high levels of saturation. Additional work is needed to improve sensitivity in the low saturation region. by Alexander V. Mamishev. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the applicability of using supercritical (sc) hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) as alternative solvents for hydrogenation and polymer modification processes. Solubility studies in binary and ternary systems have been carried out using both <b>dielectrometry</b> and gravimetric techniques and results show that a range of unsaturated carboxylic acids (crotonic acid, 6 -methoxy- 1 -tetralone, methylsuccinic acid, alpha-acetamido-cinnamic acid and itaconic acid) have a high degree of solubility in 1, 1, 1, 2 -tetrafluoroethane (HFC 134 a). The solubility results were modelled successfully using the Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR EOS) and this model was used to devise a separation methodology for itaconic acid and methylsuccinic acid. It is suggested that HFC 134 a can be used as both the reaction medium and the extracting solvent, which enables in-line separation of compounds during sc synthesis.;The homogeneous asymmetric hydrogenation of a range of unsaturated substrates (itaconic acid, dimethyl itaconate, alpha-acetamido-cinnamic acid and trans- 2 -methyl- 2 -penetenoic acid) has been studied using a rhodium/MonoPhos catalytic system. High yields and enantiomeric excesses (ee's) have been observed and this, coupled with the separation technique, provides an effective method of asymmetric reduction, which greatly enhances the commercial applicability of this technology.;The infusion of difluoromethane (HFC 32) into polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene (PE) has been characterised and the results have been compared to those obtained for carbon dioxide. Significant plasticization was observed in the polymeric materials and it was shown that manipulation of the experimental temperature, pressure and depressurisation rate could cause significant changes in the morphology of the samples.;It is concluded that sc HFCs are promising alternatives to conventional organic solvents and are useful for a variety of processes. These media have accessible critical constants, relatively high dielectric constant values and are able to facilitate the dissolution of polar solutes and rhodium based catalysts without the need for co-solvents or fluorinated ponytails. Furthermore, the investigation suggests that reactions carried out in the sc regime can allow facile reagent/product separation and it is logical to assume that a similar methodology can be applied to catalyst recovery. >...|$|E
