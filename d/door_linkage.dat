30|$|In {{the process}} of the {{implementation}} of the CBTC system, the structure of the signal system was optimized and functional limitation was surpassed by large numbers of research and in-depth analysis of the international standards and systems [12]. The innovative results are as follows: the standard system equipment configuration principles, signal equipment layout design principles, design principles of CBTC backup mode, platform screen <b>door</b> <b>linkage</b> function of intermittent type, interface design principles, design and on-site verification of signal system with 2 -min tracking interval running ability, the guide tube optimization scheme, wireless network security testing, and driving process fault handling function optimization [13, 14, 15].|$|E

40|$|Flight {{tests of}} the {{propulsion}} system of a YF- 12 airplane were made which included off-schedule inlet operation and deliberately induced unstarts and compressor stalls. The tests showed inlet/engine compatibility to be good {{through most of the}} flight envelope. The position of the terminal shock wave could be determined from throat static pressure profiles or from root-mean-square levels of throat static pressure fluctuations. A digital simulation of the control system showed an oscillation of the forward bypass doors to be caused by hysteresis in the bypass <b>door</b> actuator <b>linkages...</b>|$|R
30|$|Overall {{legislative}} changes {{have created the}} basic conditions for ISLs but have not tackled a number of constraining factors. The new institutional settings offer better opportunities for collaboration, although the Law on NAS and the Law on HEIs still leave the <b>doors</b> for <b>linkages</b> with industry only half-open. As The World Bank report stated, the Law on HE ‘neither allows nor motivates HEIs to be actively engaged in research and development’ (2013). The engagement of HEIs in commercial activities is restricted to those which are specified in their charters, and the Law on Scientific and Scientific-Technical Activities does not clearly specify the ownership of research outcomes (Para 54).|$|R
