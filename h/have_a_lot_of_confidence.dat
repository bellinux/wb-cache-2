At Wake Forest, Cummings came off the bench in relief of Milanovich, who had struggled reading the blitz, and played the last 39 minutes. He completed 20 passes on 30 attempts for 222 yards. He led three drives that culminated in a field goal, touchdown, and a final series which used eight minutes of the game clock in the 9 - 6 victory.

30|$|However, {{there are}} two {{important}} limitations to the current analysis that suggest additional investigation is required before broadly recommending linear cursor paths. First, the efficiency of a linear cursor path depends on the frequency distribution of characters in the text corpus. When more characters {{are part of the}} keyboard, the number of cursor steps for characters {{at the end of the}} path increases accordingly. If the frequency distribution of characters is fairly uniform, then average entry time will dramatically increase for larger keyboards, and there may then be an advantage to hierarchical cursor paths. Second, the predicted optimal linear keyboards used the smallest possible cursor duration (10 ms), but the model prediction of performance for such a cursor duration is based on experimental data that measured performance for much longer cursor durations (the briefest being 100 ms). We do not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in the model’s prediction for such short cursor durations. In a similar way, the predicted performance for cursor steps beyond eight are also not directly supported by experimental data. We do not have evidence that the model does poorly in these conditions, but there should be validation of the model (and possibly refinement) with additional empirical studies.|$|E
40|$|The present {{paper has}} been made as an {{introduction}} to Cambridge English Readers, dealing with 84 books with CDs, {{all of which are}} divided into 7 grades from “starter/beginner” to “advanced” levels. In general, what we call graded readers tend to be mainly made up of well-known English and American masterpieces specially rewritten for foreign learners of English with easier, limited vocabularies. Cambridge University Press, however, has boldly decided to make the series consist of only original novels and stories, which is certainly the most outstanding characheristic of Cambridge English Readers. In fact, the publisher seems to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in this feature, boasting on the back cover of each book: “Cambridge English Readers is an exciting series of original fiction, (…) the stories in this series provide easy and enjoyable reading {{on a wide range of}} contemporary topics and themes. ” Although it cannot be denied that some of the series might turn out to not be as enjoyable as advertised, Cambridge English Readers are on the whole worth reading as ideal books for those who want to read novels in English. The paper provides a gereral introduction to Cambridge English Readers, and brief summaries of the 84 books. Richard MacAndrew, Sue Leather, Margaret Johnson, and Antoinette Moses are regular Cambridge novelists; Frank Brennan has written a variety of interesting short stories for the series. There are several books with Japanese as main characters, for example, Judith Wilson’s Staying Together and Michael Austen’s Berlin Express. The former is a love story and the latter a thriller, both of which can be fully appreciated especially among young Japanese students of English...|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore {{perceptions}} of adult English-language learners' life transitions and identity construction resulting from their experience in noncredit (ESL) programs offered at a community college. Two research questions guided this study: (1) How do adult English-language learners perceive the role of ESL programs in their identity construction? (2) How do adult English-language learners perceive the role of ESL programs in their life transitions? Twenty-four intermediate and advanced ESL students participated in this study, and the basic interpretive qualitative research method was used to understand their perspectives. Interviews were the means of data collection. Three major themes and numerous subthemes emerged from the interviews and were organized into three parts. Findings in Part I: "I <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>Confidence</b> in Myself": English Learning and Identity Development, uncovered how adult English-language learners changed their self-perceptions as they became more confident, which, in turn, helped them become part of a community and independent from others. Developing self-confidence caused them also to feel better in life and as parents. Part II: "I Changed my Life Like 100 Percent": English Learning and Life Transitions, revealed participants' perceptions of their life changes after starting to attend noncredit ESL classes at a community college. Many of them were able to change a job to a better one or find a job. They also became aware of new opportunities and possibilities in their lives. Part III: "It's Just Good Atmosphere": Response to Adult English Learners' Needs, presented participants' reflections on how their needs were being met in a noncredit ESL program at a community college. They discussed their experiences in terms of ESL teachers, ways of learning English in the classroom, and the program's response to their needs. Subsequently, they presented ideas about desired characteristics of ESL teachers, preferred ways of learning, and improvements to the program to serve them better. Ed. D. (Doctor of Education...|$|E
