5000|$|After O'Brien and Redmond had met {{the head}} of the Civil Service in Dublin Castle, Sir Anthony MacDonnell, for {{informal}} talks on 6 February, the National Directory and the Parliamentary party gave approval to the Land Conference terms on 16 February. The bill to achieve social reconciliation in Ireland was finally introduced by Wyndham on 25 March 1903. The Irish Landowners' Convention which met in April acclaimed the bill as [...] "by far the largest and most liberal measure ever offered to landlords and tenants by any Government in any country". A League Convention on 16 April saw 3,000 Nationalist supporters applaud the bill and O'Brien's resolution which [...] "pledged the Irish nation [...] [...] [...] [...] [...] to the vital principle of the policy of national reconciliation". He followed this by orchestrating the greatest and widest piece of social legislation Ireland had yet seen, the Land (Purchase) Act (1903) through Parliament. The Act provided generous bonus-subsidy terms to landowners on sale, the Irish Land Commission overseeing the new landowner's low <b>interest</b> <b>annuities.</b> O'Brien saw his achievement as having guided the official nationalist movement into endorsement of a new policy of [...] "conference plus business" [...] and of having set in motion events of decisive importance in reversing the consequences of centuries of alien domination. In the period 1903 to 1909 over 200,000 peasants became owners of their holdings under the Act.

40|$|As {{time goes}} on, {{due to the}} growing {{specialization}} and complication of problems, Enterprise Economy is coming to be a special branch of science which, from its beginning, has had an operational character. The difference, however, {{is not so much}} due to the latter feature but derives from its problems and methods. Nowadays Enterprise Economy is oriented toward the future, whereas previously it was aimed preferentially toward the past. As regards methods, the difference lies in the growing use of mathematical language which makes it possible to tackle problems formerly not accessible to exact scientific procedures. Nowadays it is focused on the problems of planning which are characteristic of it. By means of examples some short – and long-term planning problems are explained. Starting out from the analysis of COURNOT, of the planning of the "outlet/price" curve, a way is shown towards the methods of lineal and non-lineal programming. The new methods do not replace the marginal analysis which continues as the central instrument, still indispensable also in modern investigation. In an accounting system orientated towards the future, the centre of gravity of planning and planning control necessarily has to lie on the departmental side. A warning is expressed against assigning too much importance to calculating machines and not enough to the investigation of the economic possibilities of electronic equipment. Problems of long-term planning are briefly dealt with such as those discussed in investment theory, expounding the basic methods (capitalization, internal <b>interest,</b> <b>annuities),</b> rejecting as inapplicable more recent attempts {{to solve the problem of}} economical yield simultaneously with the problem of liquidity.

40|$|This paper solves an empirically {{parameterized}} {{model of}} households’ optimal demand for nominal and inflation indexed annuities. The model incorporates mortality, inflation, and {{real interest rate}} risk. The model draws some interesting predictions. First, the welfare calculations on the access to annuities markets show that nominal annuities are welfare improving even when sold at the empirically parameterized cost, which is above fair value. Real annuities are welfare improving over nominal annuities when sold at a fair price, but when we incorporate the empirically parameterized annuity premium the gains become negative at all wealth levels. Second, the simulation of {{the model for the}} British population wealth distribution shows that an important explanation for the little <b>interest</b> in <b>annuities</b> {{comes from the fact that}} annuities are extremely expensive, compared with the total accumulated assets held by households. In other words many households can not afford even to enter the annuity market. The paper also compares the simulated annuity demand to the actual demands reported in the Family Resources Survey. For those individuals who buy annuities, the simulated demands are not very different from those observed in the survey...|$|R

Abstract: The PhD thesis presents a comprehensive {{view of the}} development and the position of financial mathematics in Czech textbooks and collections particularly those used in high schools with consideration of the political situation in our country. The analysed period from 1908, i. e. from the Marchet's Reform, to the present is divided into five principal stages. In each stage textbooks covering financial mathematics instruction in all types of secondary schools are chosen. This shows the level and extent of the presentation, {{the complexity of the}} given tasks and problems {{and the way in which}} they are integrated into the textbooks or the syllabus, more precisely. At first the basic general characteristics of the textbooks are presented followed by a detailed description of partial topics of study which are then analysed thoroughly and mutually compared. The conclusions of the PhD thesis reflect the current situation of financial mathematics instruction and offer ways leading to the improvement in the level of financial literacy of our citizens.

40|$|The {{unique way}} of {{financing}} housing through the mandatory savings system in Singapore {{has created a}} class of “asset-rich and cash-poor” Singaporeans. This paper provides a framework to assess the viability of a reverse mortgage (RM) market so that such instruments may be harnessed {{as a source of}} financing retirement income for home owners. Based on different cost of capital, we estimate the probability of loss for both the private supplier and public provider of RMs. The probability of loss is computed by three major components: choice of replacement ratio and property growth rate; forecast of cohort survival probability by joint-life; and generation of yield curves to discount the future cash flows. The stochastic forecast of survival probability is estimated using the Lee-Carter demographic model based on the abridged life tables. The discount factor for future cash flows are generated from stochastic interest rates. Our simulation results indicate that based on the benchmark scenario, RM instruments by private providers are likely to achieve about 50 % replacement ratio for the 4 -room public housing owners. However, the market may be missing if a replacement ratio of 70 % is required. incomplete reverse mortgage market, replacement ratio, probability of loss, risk free <b>interest,</b> breakeven <b>annuity...</b>|$|R

50|$|Fixed annuities are {{regulated}} by state insurance departments and sold through insurance agents, banks, or registered representatives. Section 989J of the Act (also {{known as the}} Harkin Amendment) is targeted at removing equity indexed annuities from SEC jurisdiction. This provision will require the SEC to treat certain state-regulated annuities as exempt securities under the Securities Act of 1933, and therefore not subject to SEC registration requirements. Fixed annuities pursuant to state insurance law must provide a minimum rate of interest as provided in the annuity policy. How the actual rate of interest is credited on the policy differentiates traditional fixed annuities from indexed annuities. Traditional fixed <b>annuities</b> pay <b>interest</b> on the premium contributed at a rate declared by the insurer in advance. Some traditional fixed annuities offer multiple years guaranteed at the same rate, while others will leave the insurance company {{with the ability to}} adjust the rate annually. This rate can never be less than the minimum guaranteed rate stated in the policy. Fixed annuities are a very conservative safe money place for retirement dollars. Fixed <b>annuity</b> <b>interest</b> rates are generated from a portfolio of US treasuries or other low risk, fixed income instruments.|$|R
40|$|Guaranteed Annuity Options are options {{providing}} {{the right to}} convert a policyholder’s accumulated funds to a life annuity at a fixed rate when the policy matures. These options were a common feature in UK retirement savings contracts issued in the 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s when interest rates were high, but caused problems for insurers as the interest rates began to fall in the 1990 ’s. Currently, these options are frequently sold in the U. S. and Japan as part of variable annuity products. The last decade the literature on pricing and risk management of these options evolved. Until now, for pricing these options generally a geometric Brownian motion for equity prices is assumed. However, given the long maturities of the insurance contracts a stochastic volatility model for equity prices would be more suitable. In this paper closed form expressions are derived for prices of guaranteed annuity options assuming stochastic volatility for equity prices and either a 1 -factor or 2 -factor Gaussian interest rate model. The {{results indicate that the}} impact of ignoring stochastic volatility can be significant.
