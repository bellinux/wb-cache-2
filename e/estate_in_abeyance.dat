5000|$|The Apthorp Farm {{that lay}} on Manhattan's Upper West Side straddled the old Bloomingdale Road, {{laid out in}} 1728, which was re-surveyed as The [...] "Boulevard" [...] - [...] now Upper Broadway. It was the largest block of real estate {{remaining}} from the [...] "Bloomingdale District", a rural suburb of 18th-century New York City. Legal disputes between the eventual heirs of the Loyalist Charles Ward Apthorp and purchasers of parcels of real <b>estate</b> held <b>in</b> <b>abeyance</b> the speculative development of the area between 89th and 99th Streets, from Central Park to the Hudson River until final judgment was awarded in July 1910; {{at that time the}} New York Times estimated its worth at $125,000,000.|$|R
40|$|The federal <b>estate</b> tax is <b>in</b> <b>abeyance</b> this year. The {{popular press}} {{has picked up}} on the {{possibility}} that the estates of billionaires such as the late George Steinbrenner, who owned the New York Yankees, will escape the tax. The House Ways and Means Committee, chaired by Representative Sander Levin of Michigan, and the Senate Finance Committee, chaired by Senator Max Baucus of Montana, are now considering two questions: what the maximum rate and exemption will be when the estate tax returns and whether the tax will be reinstated for this year. Lurking behind the headlines but equally important is another tax, the federal generation-skipping transfer tax (“GST Tax”), which is also <b>in</b> <b>abeyance</b> this year...|$|R

50|$|It {{is entirely}} {{possible}} for a peerage to remain <b>in</b> <b>abeyance</b> for centuries.

The only titles other than a barony that have yet gone into abeyance are the earldom of Arlington and the viscountcy of Thetford, which are united, and (as noted above) the earldom of Cromartie.|$|R
