5|$|An <b>endpoint</b> of a pipe is {{addressable}} with a tuple (device_address, endpoint_number) as {{specified in}} a TOKEN packet that the host sends when {{it wants to}} start a data transfer session. If {{the direction of the}} data transfer is from the host to the <b>endpoint,</b> an OUT packet (a specialization of a TOKEN packet) having the desired device address and <b>endpoint</b> number is sent by the host. If the direction of the data transfer is from the device to the host, the host sends an IN packet instead. If the destination <b>endpoint</b> is a uni-directional <b>endpoint</b> whose manufacturer's designated direction does not match the TOKEN packet (e.g. the manufacturer's designated direction is IN while the TOKEN packet is an OUT packet), the TOKEN packet is ignored. Otherwise, it is accepted and the data transaction can start. A bi-directional <b>endpoint,</b> on the other hand, accepts both IN and OUT packets.|$|E

5|$|A cutset in an {{arbitrary}} connected graph is {{a subset of}} edges defined from a partition of the vertices into two subsets, by including an edge in the subset when it has one <b>endpoint</b> {{on each side of}} the partition.

A minimal cutset (also called a bond) is a cutset with the property that every proper subset of the cutset is not itself a cut.

A simple cycle is a connected subgraph in which each vertex of the cycle is incident to exactly two edges of the cycle.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia {{imposes a}} great burden on society, and while {{evaluation}} should {{play an important}} role in informing society’s efforts to alleviate these burdens, it is unclear what “endpoints ” should be chosen as the objective of such analyses. OBJECTIVE: To elicit <b>endpoints</b> directly from patients with schizophrenia, to ascertain whether patients are sufficiently cognoscente to express what <b>endpoints</b> are and are not important to them and to rank the relevant <b>endpoints.</b> METHODS: We apply principles of patient-centered health technology assessment to identify and value <b>endpoints</b> from the patient’s perspective. Focus groups were conducted to elicit <b>endpoints,</b> using interpretive phenomalogical analysis (IPA) to guide the collection, analysis and interpretation of data. Patient interviews were subsequently used to elicit patient preference over <b>endpoints.</b> Respondents were presented with cards outlining the <b>endpoints</b> and asked to remove irrelevant cards. They where then asked to identify and rank their five most relevant <b>endpoints</b> in order of importance. Interviews were recorded for the purposed of triangulation, and data was analyzed using descriptive statistics...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} a possible universal constraint on spatial meaning.

In Experiment 1, we show that people discriminate the <b>endpoints</b> of spatial motion events more readily than they do event beginnings—suggesting a non-linguistic attentional bias toward <b>endpoints.</b> In Experiment 2, speakers of Arabic, Chinese, and English each described a set of spatial events displayed in video clips. Although the spatial systems of these languages differ, speakers of all three languages made finer semantic distinctions at event <b>endpoints,</b> compared to event beginnings.

5|$|The most {{abundant}} iron isotope 56Fe {{is of particular}} interest to nuclear scientists because it represents the most common <b>endpoint</b> of nucleosynthesis. Since 56Ni (14 alpha particles) is easily produced from lighter nuclei in the alpha process in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see silicon burning process), it is the <b>endpoint</b> of fusion chains inside extremely massive stars, since addition of another alpha particle, resulting in 60Zn, requires a great deal more energy. This 56Ni, which has a half-life of about 6days, is created in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the supernova remnant gas cloud, first to radioactive 56Co, and then to stable 56Fe. As such, iron is the {{most abundant}} element in the core of red giants, and is the most abundant metal in iron meteorites and in the dense metal cores of planets such as Earth. It is also very common in the universe, relative to other stable metals of approximately the same atomic weight.
