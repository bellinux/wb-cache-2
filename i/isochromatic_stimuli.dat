40|$|AbstractWe have {{investigated}} the apparent collapse of stereopsis obtained with random-dot-stereograms at isoluminance. Contrast thresholds for both depth and form discrimination of targets in random-dot- and figural stereograms were measured {{at a number of}} disparities, using both isoluminant and <b>isochromatic</b> <b>stimuli.</b> All contrast thresholds for stereoscopic tasks were normalised to contrast thresholds for detecting the appropriate stimulus. We found that at isoluminance contrast thresholds for depth judgements were no higher for random-dot compared to figural stereograms, even when normalised to the same thresholds obtained with <b>isochromatic</b> <b>stimuli.</b> On the other hand contrast thresholds for three-dimensional form judgements were much higher than those for depth judgements in isoluminant, compared to isochromatic random-dot-stereograms. This specific impairment of stereoscopic form (as opposed to depth) processing at isoluminance was confirmed in a further experiment in which subjects were required to judge the presence and orientation of depth corrugations in a disparity-modulated random-dot-stereogram...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMatch stimuli {{presented}} {{on one side}} of a contextual image were adjusted to have the same appearance as test stimuli {{presented on}} the other side. Both full color and isochromatic contextual images were used. Contextual image pairs were constructed that had identical S-cone image planes, while their L- and M-cone image planes differed. The data show that the S-cone component of the matches depends on the L- and M-cone planes of the contextual image. This dependence means that matches obtained using <b>isochromatic</b> <b>stimuli</b> (lightness matches) may not be used directly to predict full color matches...|$|E

40|$|We report {{experiments}} which {{compare the}} ability of subjects to employ colour vs luminance contrast {{as a basis for}} discriminating the degree of collinearity of random element string pairs. The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine the extent to which spatial integration mechanisms could utilize colour contrast. In order to probe directly the processes of spatial integration per se, it was necessary to control for any differences in the efficiency with which the visual system utilized colour and luminance contrast to locate the positions of the i~~dual elements in the test stimuli. To do this we first established the “equivalent ” luminance contrast of an <b>isochromatic</b> <b>stimulus</b> which produced equal performance to an isohuninant stimulus in a 2 element per string alignment ask. This equated the colour defined and luminance defined stimuli for local positional acuity. We then measured performance for both isohuninant and equivalent luminance contrast stimuli for strings consisting of 2, 4, 8 and I 6 elements. This tested for any differences in the processes of spatial integration. For both unmasked stimuli and stimuli embedded in lu~n ~ noise, there was no consistent rend favouring either luminance or colour contrast as the number of elements in the stimuli was increased. We conclude that the visual system is able to employ colour contrast as efficiently as luminance contrast for collinearity judgements, thus implicating a general role for colour vision in spatia...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that a {{chromatic}} mechanism can drive pupil responses. The aim of this research was to clarify whether a linear or nonlinear chromatic mechanism drives pupillary responses by using test stimuli of various colours that are defined in cone contrast space. The pupil and accommodation responses evoked by these test stimuli were continuously and simultaneously objectively measured by photorefraction. The results with <b>isochromatic</b> and isoluminant <b>stimuli</b> showed that (lie accommodative level remained approximately constant (< 0. 25 D change in mean level) even when the concurrent pupillary response was large (ca. 0. 30 mm). The pupillary response to an isoluminant grating was sustained, delayed by ca. 60 ms) and larger in amplitude than that for a <b>isochromatic</b> uniform <b>stimulus,</b> which supports previous work suggesting that the chromatic mechanism contributes to the pupillary response. In a second experiment, selected chromatic test gratings were used and isoresponse contours in cone contrast space were obtained. The results showed that the isoresponse contour in cone contrast space is well described (r 2 = 0. 99) by a straight line with a positive slope. The results indicate that a [L-M] linear chromatic mechanism, whereby a signal from the long wavelength cone is subtracted from that of the middle wavelength cone and vice versa, drives pupillary responses...|$|R
40|$|We {{determined}} visual reaction {{times to}} monocular and binocular {{changes in the}} luminance of <b>isochromatic</b> <b>stimuli</b> and to monocular and binocular changes in the color of isoluminant stimuli. Two isoluminant color changes were tested: chromatic variations along the red–green axis of Boynton’s (1986) two-stage color vision model and chromatic variations along the yellow–blue axis of the same model. The results indicate {{a greater degree of}} binocular summation for luminance change than for color change. This result was largely independent of the motor component of reaction time.

40|$|We {{examined}} the limitations imposed by neural factors on spatial contrast sensitivity for both isochromatic and isoluminant gratings. Weused two strategies to isolate these neural factors. First, we eliminated the e~f~ct of blurring by the dioptrics {{of the eye}} by using interference fringes., Second, w ~ correc. ted our data for addl~lOnal sensitivity losses {{up to and including}} the site of photon absorption by applymg an Ideal-observer analysis described by Geisler [J. Opt. Soc. Am. AI, 775 (1984) ]. Our measu~ementsind~cate t~at the. neural ~isu ~ syst~m modifies the shape of the contrast-sensitivity functions for both isochromatic and isoluminant ~tImuh at hlg. h spatial frequencies. If we assume that the high-spati~-~reque~cyperforman~eof the neural visual ~ystem IS determined by a low-pass spatial filter followed by additive noise, then the VISUal system has a spatIal. bandwidth 1. 8 times lower for isoluminant red-green than for <b>isochromatic</b> <b>stimuli.</b> On the other hand, we fmd no difference in bandwidth or sensitivity of the neural visual system for isoluminant red-green and S-coneisolated stimuli...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIt is {{well known}} that {{chromatic}} information can assist in solving the stereo correspondence problem. It has also been suggested that there are two independent first-order stereopsis mechanisms, one sensitive to chromatic contrast and the other sensitive to luminance contrast (Vision Research 37 (1997) 1271). Could the effect of chromatic information on stereo correspondence be subserved by interactions between these mechanisms? To address this question, disparity thresholds (1 /stereoacuity) were measured using 0. 5 cpd Gabor patches. The stimuli possessed different relative amounts of chromatic and luminance contrast which could be correlated or anti-correlated between the eyes. Stereoscopic performance with these compound stimuli was compared to that with purely isoluminant and <b>isochromatic</b> <b>stimuli</b> at different contrasts. It was found that anti-correlated chromatic contrast severely disrupted stereopsis with achromatic stimuli and that anti-correlated luminance contrast severely disrupted stereopsis with chromatic stimuli. Less dramatic, but still significant, was the improvement in stereoacuity obtained using correlated colour and luminance contrast. These data are consistent with there being positive and negative interactions between chromatic and achromatic stereopsis mechanisms that take place after the initial encoding of disparity information, but before the extraction of stereoscopic depth. These interactions can be modelled satisfactorily assuming probability summation of depth sign information between independent mechanisms...|$|E
