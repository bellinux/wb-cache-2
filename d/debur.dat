40|$|The Timesaver belt {{grinding}} machine {{has been selected}} by the Atlas collaboration for deburring the master and spacer plates after die stamping and laser cutting, respectively. However, the question has been raised {{as to whether or}} not the plates are sufficiently clean after going through the Timesaver machine to immediately be glued into a submodule assembly. This would greatly enhance the production of submodules because the task of cleaning individual master and spacer plates is labor intensive and time consuming as well as raises environmental issues with the detergent that is used. In order to investigate the possibility of using the Timesaver process to clean the plates as well as <b>debur</b> them, several plates were run through the machine and their cleanliness inspected before and after. In addition, several glue samples were subjected to the same process, glued, and then pulled apart in an attempt to gauge the cleanliness of the plates. From this series of tests it can be concluded that the wet Timesaver machine can adequately prepare the surface of the master and spacer plates as well as clean the plates for gluing. The machine was able to adequately remove all of the oil and grime from the test plates.

40|$|Department of Electrical EngineeringLearning {{representations}} for {{object recognition}} and image quality enhancement with the deep {{convolutional neural network}} approach has received {{a great deal of attention}} in the past several years and recently has gained widespread popularity in the field of computer vision and image processing. Many convolutional neural networks based researches has shown successful results in image processing and computer vision area by feeding only raw images into the convolutional neural network model to learn network parameters. In supervised learning, every input image in our traingset is "a question" and corresponding label or groundtruth is "a correct answer" that we would have quite liked the algorithms have predicted on that image. Even though the CNN models can be skillful enough to solve a problem by learning a large trainingset, we expect that if CNNs were feed with additional information, as well as with images, that would leads learning in a better way, it may perform better. It is like giving helpful hints when teaching a child. This thesis presents fingerprint liveness detection and space-varying deblur methods based on CNN. The first fingerprint liveness detection belongs to a classification problem and the second space-varying deblur belongs to a prediction problem of original sharpen image. Instead of training CNNs with input images only, we provide additional information with which CNNs can learn features in a domain specific, or a problem specific way. Simple additional information that can obtain fairly easily but crucial for a given task is used as an additional input of each CNN. Sweat pore map is used as additional information for fingerprint liveness detection and spatial pixel indices are used as additional information for space-varying deblur. For fingerprint liveness detection, the sweat pore map provides enough hint to allow CNN to learn features for specific regions such as regions right at the pores, regions around the pores, regions in the ridges that do not contain pores. Our fingerprint liveness detection method outperforms the best algorithms of fingerprint liveness detection competition 2013 (LivDet 2013). For CNN based space-varying <b>debur,</b> the spatial pixel indices provide enough hint to allow CNN to learn filters that have stronger response at specific areas of an image. Our non-stationary lens blur method is the first CNN model that directly outputs the restored image from a blurry image, without any assumption or approximation of block-wise spatially invariant blur. The proposed deblurring method provides the state-of-the-art performances. We established procedures for building training sets from real-world lenses and cameras for restoration of lens blur. ope...|$|E

40|$|Although <b>deburring</b> {{technology}} {{is used in}} precision manufacturing and high-quality machining, <b>deburring</b> is still considered a difficult problem. Precision parts require care to achieve precise dimensions and surface quality and in subsequent finishing operations. <b>Deburring</b> and edge finishing typically receive little attention from designers and manufacturing engineers.

40|$|Abstract. In {{sheet metal}} {{processes}} the burrs cannot be completely eliminated {{during the process}} but can be minimized by optimization of the process parameters. Hence the <b>deburring</b> often becomes an essential secondary operation. Most of the <b>deburring</b> operations are hand-made and therefore several manufacturers tend to eliminate these tedious and labor-intensive operations due to time and cost issues. Moreover, clamping problems can arise which, together with the <b>deburring</b> forces, can induce dimension alterations and local deformations, particularly for thin sheets. Barrel finishing is an old technique commonly used to improve the surface roughness of complicated parts, but can find interesting applications also in the <b>deburring.</b> Aim of this work is to present an experimental investigation on the <b>deburring</b> of sheet metal performed by barreling.

40|$|Burrs {{have been}} defined as {{undesirable}} projections of material beyond {{the edge of a}} workpiece during machining. Burrs are created around the edge of workpiece due to plasticity during mechanical manufacturing process. Recently, because of miniaturization and increased precision of the machined parts, the size of burrs has been also reduced and <b>deburring</b> became even more difficult. Generally, burrs have been removed by method of physics and chemistry. There are a few publications in the area of applying ultrasonics to <b>deburring.</b> When ultrasonic vibration propagates in the liquid medium, a large number of bubbles are formed.

The application of robots to <b>deburring</b> has been limited by the difficulties in achieving the required degree of quality, controlling reaction forces during metal removal and the lack of tooling designed specifically for robots.

My mission within this company was to realize work instructions for <b>deburring</b> of robot cells. To explain this mission, first we are going to explain the goal, and then we are going to present the different steps to complete this mission. The goal of this mission is to improve the manufacturing process of parts, and so to improve the production. All of this, by establishing working instructions allowing automated <b>deburring</b> operations on parts. The first thing was to have a provisional repertoire of parts which are machined on robot cell on which I worked. With this list, I determined articles on which I had to make modifications. Indeed, improvements must be made on parts having the largest machining time for month on the robot cell. The second step was to make an inventory of parts previously targeted, to identify different <b>deburring</b> there are to perform during machining. So, I had to analyze computer machining simulations and to discuss with the machine operators to know the different <b>deburring</b> already performed during machining, and those remaining to complete. An inventory of tools for <b>deburring</b> which are presents in the workshop and <b>deburring</b> stations has been also realized.

40|$|Removal of burrs at cross-drilled hole intersections {{is often}} tedious and {{expensive}} due to limited accessibility. Automated edge finishing of crossholes has been practiced successfully using robot-assisted, flexible abrasive brush <b>deburring,</b> and non-traditional, mass finishing {{methods such as}} electrochemical <b>deburring</b> (ECD), abrasive slurry, and thermal <b>deburring.</b> These methods are very efficient but most require specialized equipment and dedicated cleaning operations to remove chemicals or trapped brush bristles. The Orbitool is an on-line, localized <b>deburring</b> alternative to brushes recently developed by JWDone Company. The Orbitool is a mechanized cutting tool with carbide edges specifically designed for crosshole <b>deburring.</b> Mechanized cutting provides greater selectivity and control of dimensional specifications compared to brushing and mass finishing methods. Furthermore, it can be implemented using existing machine tool equipment and cleaning procedures.
