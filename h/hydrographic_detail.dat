Spatial scales of temperature distribution {{and the depth of}} the upper boundary of AW were estimated. In the Canadian Basin spatial variations of temperature were less pronounced. During IPY 2007 / 2008 the area occupied by AW has increased. According to our estimations the positive temperature anomaly in some regions was as high as 1, 5 °C, which is about 70 % of temperature maximum in 1950 - 1959. The upper boundary of AW (zero degree isotherm) rose by 40 - 120 m around the Mendeleyev Ridge and in the Amundsen Basin. At the same time, in the Canada Basin and in the western Fram Strait the AW thickness decreased by similar value. Heat content of the AW layer around the major part of the Arctic Ocean exceeded mean climatic value, except for the compact area north of Franz Josef Land, where small negative anomaly was observed. Throughout 2008 mean temperature and maximum temperature in the AW layer were higher than mean climatic values. At the same time, the state of AW layer in the inflow region, east of Fram Strait along the continental margin to the Laptev Sea, substantially changed in comparison with 2007.

The two GMW locations also align with modeled runoff discharged at separate locations along the grounded margin corresponding with two prominent subcatchments beneath Saqqarliup sermia. Thus, near-ice observations and subglacial discharge routing indicate that runoff from this glacier occurs primarily at two discrete locations and gives rise to two distinct glacially modified waters. Furthermore, we show that the location with the largest subglacial discharge is associated with the lighter, fresher glacially modified water mass.

Observations from two <b>detailed</b> <b>hydrographic</b> surveys conducted during November 1998 and February 1999 are used to delineate the processes influencing nutrient enrichment across the continental shelf off the central east coast of Australia. Four nutrient enrichment mechanisms are identified: wind-driven upwelling, upwelling driven by the encroachment of the EAC onto the continental shelf, acceleration of the current resulting from the narrowing of the continental shelf at Smoky Cape, and the separation of the EAC from the coast. This study demonstrates that both the strength of the current and its proximity to the coast determine the nature of the upwelling response. An increase in nutrient concentrations occurs downstream as a result of each of the mechanisms identified. The highest nutrient concentration is attributable to the encroachment of the current onto the shelf, whilst separation induced upwelling is the most widespread...|$|R

At Punta Alta he made a major find of gigantic fossils of extinct mammals, then known from only a very few specimens. He ably collected and made detailed observations of plants and animals, with results that shook his belief that species were fixed and provided the basis for ideas which came to him when back in England, and led to his theory of evolution by natural selection.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} a <b>detailed</b> <b>hydrographic</b> survey of the Mascarene Plateau and surrounding area undertaken by the R. R. S. Charles Darwin in June-July 2002. We examine how the westward-flowing South Equatorial Current (SEC) crosses the Plateau, and how {{the structure of the}} flow determines the supply of nutrients to the surface waters. We find that the flow of the SEC across the Plateau is highly dependent on the complex structure of the Banks which make up the Plateau, and that {{a large part of the}} flow is channelled between the Saya de Malha and Nazareth Banks. Furthermore, the SEC forms a sharp boundary between subtropical water masses from further south which are low in nutrients, and waters from further north which are relatively nutrient rich. Overall, the SEC delivers relatively high levels of nutrients to the near-surface waters of the central and northern regions of the Plateau, as compared with the southern regions of the Plateau. This is partly due to uplifting of density surfaces through Ekman suction on the northern side of the SEC, and partly due to the higher levels of nutrients on those density surfaces on the northern side of the SEC. This may drive increased production of phytoplankton in these areas, which would in turn be expected to fuel increased abundances of zooplankton and higher levels of the food chain...|$|R

In January 1996 a <b>detailed</b> <b>hydrographic</b> survey to the east of the island showed that on-shelf waters were both warmer and fresher than those off-shelf. These differences were not confined to surface waters. The inherent density differences resulted in a shelf break front, the position of which was defined as the point where the 26. 96 kg m- 3 isopycnal crossed 30 dbar as it rose towards the surface. The slope of the shelf break front between the on- and off-shelf waters was found to be approximately geostrophic. Although the position of the shelf break front was not linked to any particular bottom depth, its position was strongly influenced by the bottom topography in the region. Evidence is presented for upwelling in one specific region along the front. Differences between the on- and off-shelf waters are also observed in nutrient and chlorophyll a data: These data implied greater productivity on-shelf. Both physical and chemical data suggest that on- and off-shelf waters communicate at depth.

The timing of the study was such that the onset of the 1991 - 1992 El Nino/Southern Oscillation was directly observed in the data obtained. A <b>detailed</b> <b>hydrographic</b> analysis of the data showed single station temperature anomalies as great as 4. 48 standard deviations warmer than the historical 40 year CalCOFI mean, and salinity anomalies 5. 58 standard deviations fresher during February, 1992.

A TS analysis suggested that there were no large intrusions of different water mass types, and that the anomalies resulted primarily from altered mixing processes due to thermocline/halocline depression. Strong positive sea level anomalies for the west coast of North and South America occurred simultaneously at the Equator and the far north (Gulf of Alaska) then spread from both directions towards central California.

The series has been collected in similar form since 1986. A key characteristic of the cruise is the integration of oceanographic and biological information to enhance understanding of environmental and (fish) population fluctuations, and evolutionary processes in this system. The resulting datasets and samples are an essential component of the international EU project BONUS BIO-C 3 coordinated by GEOMAR. The spatial focus lay on the Bornholm Basin (the most important spawning area of Baltic cod), but also included the Western Baltic Sea, Arkona Basin, Gdansk Deep, and Stolpe Trench.

The first study examines the effect of raster cell size on watershed boundaries and stream networks delineated from LiDAR-derived digital elevation models (DEMs). The study confirmed that, with the greatly increased resolution of LiDAR data, smaller cell sizes generally yielded better stream network delineations, based on sinuosity and LRMSE.

The method divides the region around a starting point into sectors, using the LiDAR data points within each sector to determine an average slope, and selecting the sector with the greatest downward slope to determine the direction of flow. An mDn delineation was compared with a traditional grid-based delineation, using TauDEM, and other readily available, common stream data sets. Although, the TauDEM delineation yielded a sinuosity that more closely matches the reference, the mDn delineation yielded a sinuosity that was higher than either the TauDEM method or the existing published stream delineations. Furthermore, stream delineation using the mDn method yielded the smallest LRMSE...|$|R
40|$|The {{sedimentation}} {{study on}} the upstream reach of Pahang River {{is located in the}} Bentong River Basin. The <b>detail</b> <b>hydrographic</b> survey for each river in the Bentong River Basin was carried out in May 2016. Nine stations were selected to represent the sediment concentration at Bentong River, Pahang, Malaysia. Bentong River Basin is one of the river catchment in Pahang River Basin, Malaysia. Before this, Bentong River deterioration in water quality, resulting from the sedimentation problems and unsustainable development management around the river basin. This study was implemented to prove the sedimentation problem, especially the formation of Total  Suspended Solid (TSS) in the Bentong River. There are two important parameters were quantified in this study such as the concentration of suspended solid (mg/L) and the river discharge (Q) values (m³/s). The method used in this study to analysis the concentration of TSS using Gravimetric Method. The result showed the sedimentation in the Bentong River was unstable and the highest of TSS up to 367. 6 mg/L that is categorized under the class V which > 300 mg/L based on the National Water Quality Standard (NWQS) result showed the coefficient correlation between the observed Q and the TSS concentration in the Bentong River is significant R² = 0. 919, there are strong positive relationship between TSS concentration production and the river discharge value in the Bentong River. The study found that the contributors to the high sedimentation problems resulting from the sediments generated from the unsustainable land use, which effectively trapping the bed sediments, rainfall intensity, backflow that carries out high sediments as well as sedimentation produced due to the river bank erosion...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION In {{the summer}} of 1950, the present writer spent a three weeks' holiday {{dredging}} in the Great Bitter Lake. Plans to collect specimens in that area for the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie at Leiden had, unfortunately, to be drawn up somewhat hurriedly, {{but at least the}} most essential equipment was complete {{by the beginning of the}} writer's stay at Fayed, on the western shore of the Lake. Between August 18 th and September 5 th, the Great Bitter Lake was explored as well as possible under the circumstances. The investigation discussed below was, as is fully realised, of a limited character; it consisted almost exclusively of operations for collecting marine organisms, though on a fairly large scale. However, it was considered preferable to do the work with the means available rather than let this chance slip for want of ideal circumstances, the more so because no extensive exploration of the bottom fauna of the Bitter Lake had ever been carried out in the past. The discovery of a few distinct plant zones in the Lake will, it is hoped, add to the ecological interest of the collections made. To Mr. J. Doorn, of the Anglo-Egyptian Oilfields Ltd., the writer owes many thanks for the able manufacture of a most serviceable marine dredge. The Compagnie Universelle du Canal Maritime de Suez kindly made available a <b>detailed</b> <b>hydrographic</b> map of the Great Bitter Lake. The writer is also much indebted to Miss Dr. J. Th. Koster, Rijksherbarium, Leiden, for the identification of the collected plants. BRIEF COMMENTS ON THE ISTHMUS OF SUEZ The excavation of the Suez Canal has added much interest to the manifold problem of the extent of intermingling between marine faunal provinces...|$|R
40|$|Hydrographic {{surveying}} {{although an}} expensive venture, is today {{considered the most}} significant tool in the expansion of world maritime trade by providing timely and adequate nautical information to mariners {{in the form of}} charts for safe and efficient navigation. Most maritime nations especially in developing countries may not have realized the advantages to be gained from the provision of functional hydrographic services. This has rendered their waters inadequately surveyed thereby denying them the much needed revenue to be accrued through maritime trade. IHO C- 55 publication indicated that only 20 % of Nigerian waters with depth between 0 - 200 m and 10 % with depth greater than 200 m are adequately surveyed. It further reveals 70 % with depth between 0 - 200 m and 10 % with depth greater than 200 m requires re surveying at larger scale or to modern standard, while 10 % of waters with depth between 0 - 200 m and 80 % with depth greater than 200 m has never been systematically surveyed. With this statistics, it becomes clear the need to carry out detailed survey of Nigerian waters in order to update the current charts or produce new ones. The aim of this dissertation therefore is to examine the cost benefit of surveying Nigerian waters. The dissertation examines Nigerian maritime environment, the status of hydrographic surveying, nautical charting and maritime safety information in Nigeria and the role of nautical charts. Other areas that were examined include the trend of international maritime trade and the relevance of maritime transportation on Nigerian economy. The cost benefits analysis of surveying Nigerian waters was carried out to determine the true gains to be derived from the project. Although it was difficult to quantify the economic and commercial benefit which flows with a developed hydrographic programme, it was however very clear that the benefits of carrying out a <b>detailed</b> <b>hydrographic</b> surveying of Nigerian waters outweighs the cost. The result showed an impressive cost benefit ratio of 1 : 21 which underscores the dare need to survey Nigerian waters. This is quite expected {{in the case of a}} nation that depends largely on its maritime sector for foreign exchange earnings especially in the oil and gas sector. Faculty of Scienc...|$|R
