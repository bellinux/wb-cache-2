5|$|Never before have I {{written to}} {{a player to}} express my regret at his {{omission}} from the Australian XI. In your case <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>making</b> an exception because I {{want you to know}} how much my colleagues and I disliked having to make this move. Captain one match and out of the side the next looks like ingratitude, but you understand the circumstances and {{will be the first to}} admit that your form has not been good.|$|E
25|$|I {{do want to}} {{move people}} on some deep level. But I won't take on the mantle of social responsibility. That's not {{compatible}} with entertainment. I rail against the idea that pop television is a political medium. I am political in my life. But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>making</b> serialized melodrama. I'm not a cultural missionary.|$|E
25|$|At 21:14 the Viking {{took off}} from Blackbushe Airport on an {{unscheduled}} passenger flight to RAF Idris in Libya. The aircraft on charter to the War Office had five crew, 25 soldiers from the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, one soldier's wife, two children and two war department civilians. At 21:16 the pilot reported I have port engine failure, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>making</b> a left-hand circuit to come in again. As the aircraft turned onto the approach to land about 1200 yards (1,116 m) from the runway the aircraft crashed into a wooded copse at Star Hill. Thirty-four of the 35 on board were killed.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{coaching}} six {{national championship}} teams at Michigan, Fielding H. Yost regarded the 1925 Michigan squad {{as the greatest}} team he ever coached. [...] At the annual awards dinner in 1925, Yost told the players, [...] "You {{are members of the}} greatest football team I ever coached; in fact you are the greatest football team I ever saw in action. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>making</b> this statement cognizant of the wonderful record of the 1901 team and the Point-A-Minute teams that followed." [...] Yost noted that Michigan had allowed only four first downs in the last three games of the season and added, [...] "This is the most remarkable defensive record ever made in football." ...|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant Lillian Pimlott {{wrote to}} her mother, after being {{deployed}} to Pearl Harbor, and said, [...] "I {{was fascinated by the}} ships which are making history in every battle. I've talked to seamen and I've met flyers-from Iwo (Iwo Jima), from Okinawa, heroes from every encounter. I know now what war means and {{my heart goes out to}} every one of them. Among them <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>making,</b> I hope, life long friends, for their experiences mean everything to my self-satisfaction... As long as they fight on, I have no desire to return home, for I feel I belong here... I have learned much in these brief three months about life and living. And I know I have already changed in many ways and many viewpoints... It is truly a most broadening experience and I shall never outlive it".|$|E
500|$|On November 24, 2015, Frusciante {{announced}} that he was releasing free unreleased songs dating from 2008-2013 on his own official Bandcamp and SoundCloud pages. He also debunked the interview about him retiring from the music industry, saying that his words were taken out of context. The announcement was made via Frusciante's rarely updated website in an open letter titled [...] "Hello audience," [...] where Frusciante provides an in-depth response to the reporter who, according to him, misquoted him. He writes, [...] "I also must clear something up. I normally don’t read my press, but I heard about this quote, recently taken out of context by some lame website and made into a headline, in which I said 'I have no audience'. This has been misinterpreted, and by no fault of the excellent journalist who interviewed me for the fine publication Electronic Beats. [...] Obviously I have a public audience. I am aware of them, and they know who they are." [...] He continues, [...] "Reduced to a single sentence, it would have been accurate to say that, at this point, I have no particular audience in mind while <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>making</b> music." ...|$|E

500|$|The case {{initially}} {{appeared to}} be going badly for Marshall-Hall. An inept cross-examination on his part weakened his argument, and an illness made him irritable and short-tempered. On {{the advice of his}} clerk, he asked Birkett to make the closing address before the court, which turned the mood of the courtroom completely and an initially hostile jury decided to disregard the agreement of Mr. Dennistoun to pay ancillary relief to his former wife. Birkett's performance made the front pages of many evening newspapers, including The Daily Mail which described Birkett as [...] "the greatest legal discovery of the year" [...] and called his speech [...] "a brilliant piece of advocacy". His work for this case and the newspaper coverage of it brought him to the attention of many London solicitors, and led to him earning £8,000 in the first seven months of 1925. In that year he made £12,000 overall, an amount which rose to £16,500 in 1926 and peaked in 1929 when he earned £33,500. On meeting Miles Malleson, an old friend from his time at Cambridge, he said in surprise [...] "did you know, Miles, that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>making</b> more money than I thought existed in the world!" ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1956 season, Feller started {{four games}} and {{appeared}} in 15 others, {{and finished with}} an 0–4 record and career-worst 4.97ERA. The Indians held [...] "Bob Feller Night" [...] on September 9, and he appeared in his last major league game on September 30. After the season, speculation mounted regarding whether Feller would retire as a player. In December 1956, Feller told The Plain Dealer: [...] "I will return to Cleveland later this week and plan to confer with Hank Greenberg before Christmas. I hope to reach a decision at that time." [...] Greenberg had also offered Feller his release or {{a job with the}} Indians in their front office. Greenberg said, [...] "We sincerely want Feller to remain with us. As far as I'm concerned, {{there will always be a}} job waiting for Bob in the Cleveland organization." [...] On December 28 Feller officially retired from the Indians as a player to continue his work selling insurance. Announcing his retirement, Feller said, [...] "I could have gone with a couple other ball clubs, but anything I might have done with them would have taken the edge off the success I have had with the Cleveland club the last 20 years." [...] He continued, [...] "What if I did pitch another year, so what? I would have to come to the decision <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>making</b> now, some time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tunku {{opened his}} speech in Parliament with the words, [...] "In all the 10 {{years of my}} {{leadership}} of this House I {{have never had a}} duty so unpleasant as this to perform. The announcement which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>making</b> concerns the separation of Singapore {{from the rest of the}} Federation." [...] On that day, a tearful Lee Kuan Yew announced that Singapore was a sovereign, independent nation and assumed the role of prime minister of the new nation. His speech included this quote: [...] "For me, it is a moment of anguish. All my life, my whole adult life, I have believed in merger and unity of the two territories." [...] Hence, Singapore became the only country in the history of the modern world to gain independence against its own will. After the separation and independence of Singapore in 1965, the Singapore branch of UMNO was renamed the Singapore Malay National Organisation (Pertubuhan Kebangsaan Melayu Singapura).|$|E

2500|$|This call to vote Labour {{surprised}} some of Powell's {{supporters who}} were more concerned with beating socialism than the supposed loss of national independence. On 25 February, he made another speech at Shipley, again urging a vote for Labour, saying {{he did not believe}} the claim that Wilson would renege on his commitment to renegotiation, which Powell believed was ironic because of Heath's premiership: [...] "In acrobatics Harold Wilson, for all his nimbleness and skill, is simply no match for the breathtaking, thoroughgoing efficiency of the present Prime Minister". At this moment a heckler shouted [...] "Judas!" [...] Powell responded: [...] "Judas was paid! Judas was paid! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>making</b> a sacrifice!" [...] Later in the speech Powell said, [...] "I was born a Tory, am a Tory and shall die a Tory. It is part of me... it is something I cannot alter". In 1987, Powell said there was no contradiction between urging people to vote Labour whilst proclaiming to be a Tory: [...] "Many Labour members are quite good Tories".|$|E
2500|$|Tennessee Williams {{wrote the}} {{screenplay}} and based {{the character of}} Serafina on Magnani, as Williams was a great admirer of her acting abilities, and he even stipulated that the movie [...] "must star what Time described as 'the most explosive emotional actress of her generation, Anna Magnani." [...] In his Memoirs, Williams described why he insisted on Magnani playing this role:"Anna Magnani was magnificent as Serafina in the movie version of Tattoo.... She was as unconventional a woman as I have known {{in or out of}} my professional world, and if you understand me at all, you must know that in this statement <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>making</b> my personal estimate of her honesty, which I feel was complete. She never exhibited any lack of self-assurance, any timidity in her relations with that society outside of whose conventions she quite publicly existed.... he looked absolutely straight into the eyes of whomever she confronted and during that golden time in which we were dear friends, I never heard a false word from her mouth." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 20 December 2004, Strathfield council's mayor, Alfred Tsang {{stepped down}} over {{allegations}} of corruption. Pictures {{had been published}} in The Australian of him accepting a wad of $100 bills from a developer, Michael Saklawi. However, {{it was not clear}} why the money was given to him, though it was alleged that he was talking to Mr Saklawi about the redevelopment of an [...] council-owned carpark. Tsang had previously released a statement that [...] "Councils need to take leadership roles in this area, we simply cannot continue to support unsustainable development, {{for the sake of our}} children, grandchildren and the future environment, we need to make changes now." [...] According to The Australian Tsang was heard to have said that [...] "Basically, we get it for nothing,..... <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>making</b> Strathfield a better place ... I am doing it for the area." [...] Strathfield council soon afterwards released a press statement that it [...] "will not and does not" [...] tolerate misconduct. The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) is currently investigating whether claims developers were given inside information about land rezoning proposals put to Strathfield Council have any substance and the pictures taken by The Australian were handed to them for further investigation.|$|E

2500|$|After Australia's biggest {{defeat at}} home in 50 years the Australian press were in uproar and the {{selectors}} Ewart Macmillan, Jack Ryder and Don Bradman took drastic action, dropping the captain Brian Booth, batsman Bob Cowper and the bowlers Garth McKenzie, Peter Philpott and David Sincock. Booth {{received a letter from}} Bradman on behalf of the selectors explaining [...] "Never before have I written to a player to express my regret at his omission from the Australian XI. In your case <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>making</b> an exception because I want you to know how much my colleagues and I disliked having to make this move. Captain one match and out of the side the next looks like ingratitude, but you understand the circumstances and {{will be the first to}} admit that your form has not been good." [...] Booth had made only 84 runs (16.80) in the series and never played for Australia again. Cowper was blamed for slow scoring even though he had made 99 and 60 in the Second and Third Tests. Peter Allan of Queensland was brought back into the side after he had taken the third best bowling figures in Australia – 10/61 in the first innings against Victoria, but was injured and McKenzie was restored to the team. The off-spinner Tom Veivers and young batsmen Ian Chappell were called up and Keith Stackpole made his Test debut, so Australia went to Adelaide with only three specialist bowlers – McKenzie, Hawke and Veivers. England simply kept the same XI from Sydney, even though this meant that Geoff Boycott was their third place bowler after Jeff Jones and Dave Brown. Mike Smith won the toss and decided to bat.|$|E
2500|$|Leatherface was {{originally}} slated for a 2016 release, {{which it did}} not meet. Despite having reached completion, it was temporarily shelved by Lionsgate Films. Sherwood speculated that the studio might have been afraid that they wouldn't make back their investment after another film underperformed, but {{admitted that he had}} no concrete explanation for the delay: [...] "In a strange way, I started to romanticize the idea it became some legendary lost film. It would be coveted – something spoken about, something people would try to contrive some way of seeing, something that would show up on a tired unused media at a convention in 50 years." [...] A film titled Leatherface received a direct-to-video release from Lightning Pictures in the United Kingdom in January 2017, featuring a masked chainsaw-brandishing figure on the home video cover. However, this film was not the Texas Chain Saw Massacre prequel, but rather a re-packaging of the unrelated Playing With Dolls: Bloodlust. The release was criticised by members of the press for its misleading marketing, with William Bibbiani scrutising on Blumhouse.com that [...] "It's not uncommon for horror movies to pick up new titles in domestic or foreign markets in an attempt to capitalize on various trends, but this is a particularly egregious example. It goes beyond mockbusters, which try to trick you into thinking it's the real deal, and simply takes the title of an upcoming, anticipated horror movie and tries to pass itself off as that movie." [...] Playing With Dolls director Rene Perez apologised for the title change, [...] "I am [...] to this title change but I am powerless to stop it. The sales agency didn't even inform me that a sale was made to the UK. At the moment <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>making</b> a 3rd Playing with Dolls movie. I will be self releasing the new Playing with Dolls online to avoid any issues like this in the future." ...|$|E
