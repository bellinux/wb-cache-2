40|$|Glycopeptide-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (GISA) and {{heterogeneous}} GISA (hGISA) strains {{are notoriously}} {{difficult to detect}} in the diagnostic laboratory. The clinical importance of GISA, and particularly hGISA, will only be obvious when a definitive detection method is available. A few novel GISA and hGISA detection methods have been proposed; however, their validity has never been tested on a significant scale and in different laboratories. This study compares three screening methods for detecting GISA and hGISA strains in 12 <b>laboratories,</b> <b>using</b> a blind panel of 48 strains with known glycopeptide susceptibilities. The three screening methods used were brain heart infusion agar with 6 mg/liter vancomycin (BHIA 6 V) (CDC/CLSI), Mueller-Hinton agar with 5 mg/liter teicoplanin (MHA 5 T) (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System [EARSS]), and the macrodilution method Etest (MET) (EARSS), with population analysis profile-area under the curve analysis as the gold standard. Sensitivity and specificity were highest for MHA 5 T and MET, which identified 82. 5 % and 85. 9 % of strains, respectively. BHIA 6 V had poor sensitivity, particularly for hGISA (11. 5 % of strains were detected), and gave the largest interlaboratory variation in performance. MET exhibited the least interlaboratory variation. It is <b>essential</b> that <b>laboratories</b> <b>use</b> appropriate methods to detect GISA/hGISA strains so that the prevalence and clinical importance of these strains can be assessed properly...|$|R
40|$|It is {{of great}} {{importance}} for public health that results from genetic services are correct because genetic tests for an individual are usually carried out only once in a lifetime. In order to assure high quality and accuracy of laboratory testing, appropriate control materials are <b>essential.</b> <b>Laboratories</b> mainly <b>use</b> commercially available cell lines and patient samples as controls. For many genetic tests, however, control materials are difficult to find. Based on this unmet need, synthetic quality control (QC) samples are being developed. Such synthetic samples can contain rare mutations, allow many mutations to be detected in one multiplex test and can be designed to function in distinct extraction methods. MMQCI has constructed synthetic quality control blood samples for Cystic Fibrosis (CF), containing 27 CFTR exons including intronic borders, and carrying different mutations. A thorough evaluation of this sample was performed in house by MMQCI for several DNA extraction and PCR-based amplification methods, as well as different mutation analysis methods. In order to assess {{the value of this}} synthetic blood sample on a large scale, the European Thematic CF network enclosed it as an additional sample in their External Quality Assessment scheme of 2005. More than 150 laboratories, in 46 countries registered to participate in the validation study of this QC sample. The outcome of this study will identify correlations between the detection of mutations and specific analysis methods used in routine practice. Furthermore, this validation should enable assessment of the usefulness and effectiveness of synthetic quality controls for CF testing. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Assuring {{high quality}} {{within the field}} of genetic testing is fundamental, as the results can have {{considerable}} impact on the patient and his or her family. The use of appropriate quality control (QC) samples is therefore <b>essential.</b> Diagnostic <b>laboratories</b> mainly <b>use</b> patient samples as QC material, which of course include a maximum of two mutations per sample. Bearing in mind that some assays (such as for cystic fibrosis [CF] testing) can test for more than 100 mutations, multiplex QC materials including more than two mutations could save valuable time and reagents. Based on this need, synthetic multiplex controls have been developed by Maine Molecular Quality Controls, Inc. (MMQCI) for CF A synthetic control, containing six homozygous mutations and one polymorphism for CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), was evaluated by distributing it through the CF external quality assessment (EQA) scheme, along with the EQA samples in 2005. A total of 197 participants returned results of the yearly EQA scheme and 133 laboratories participated in the evaluation of the synthetic sample. Respectively, 76 % and 73 % of the participants were assigned as successful. This evaluation study revealed that the multiplex QC material performed well in the majority of assays and could be useful in method validation, as a tool to challenge interpretation skills, and as potential proficiency testing (PT) material. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Reported are {{the results}} of a {{multicentre}} study involving 40 laboratories that was carried out in France to assess all the currently available methods used for the serodiagnosis of toxoplasmosis. For this purpose 10 batches of control sera were prepared with titres in the range 0 - 260 IU per ml. These sera were tested in nine <b>laboratories</b> <b>using</b> immunofluorescence methods; in three <b>laboratories</b> <b>using</b> dye tests; in forty <b>laboratories</b> <b>using</b> enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; in four <b>laboratories</b> <b>using</b> direct agglutination and haemagglutination; in seven <b>laboratories</b> <b>using</b> the high-sensitivity IgG agglutination test; and in three <b>laboratories</b> <b>using</b> the latex agglutination test. In this way, 70 series of titrations were carried out using seven procedures and the results were compared with those obtained using the WHO reference serum in 15 cases, with the French national E 6 serum in 16 other cases, and in 39 cases using 15 reference sera supplied by the reagent manufacturers. Rigorous comparison of the tests was not possible in all cases because one aim {{of the study was to}} ensure that the tests were carried out under the usual working conditions that prevailed in the participating laboratories. The results obtained indicate that the serological tests currently available for toxoplasmosis are acceptable for its serodiagnosis. Presentation of the titres in IU has advantages; however, caution is required since the definition of IU varies according to the test and reagents used. It is therefore essential that the conditions and limits for a positive reaction be carefully defined in each case, especially for commercially available kits...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{increasing}} {{demand for the}} chemical monitoring of water qualities emphasises the importance of an efficient and workable laboratory management system to remain profitable and competitive in a fast growing industry. The management of information is therefore becoming increasingly important as the effectiveness and profitability of the water laboratory is largely measured against its management systems and continual improvement programmes. Effective information management forms {{an important part of}} laboratory management to ensure that data are updated and remain current. One way of proving its effectiveness, the laboratory must provide proof of a controlled and procedurised documentation system and the availability of updated data and information. The effective control of data and information in the water <b>laboratory</b> by <b>using</b> some kind of information management system is therefore <b>essential.</b> <b>Laboratory</b> managers are becoming aware of the need for an effective, computerised laboratory data and information management system as the entry of data and results into a manual system has several disadvantages. The laboratory manager is increasingly seeking for ways to improve the efficiency of his laboratory and more time must therefore be spent on managing the laboratory, rather than to facilitate the distribution and control of information...|$|R
