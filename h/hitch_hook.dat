40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to develop a system for accurately measuring in real-time, collecting and processing a high amount of geo-referenced data of soil physical-mechanical parameters, e. g. cone penetrometer resistance, index of soil compaction, and draft force. The system for measuring the soil cone penetrometer resistance is comprised of a load cell, connected to a rod, ending with a cone, and is mounted on a frame, fixed to the front part of a tractor. The system for measuring the draft force required to till the soil is comprised of a load cell, mounted on the <b>hitch</b> <b>hook</b> of a tool carrier, towed by the tractor. Moreover, in order to test the usefulness of the system with different types of linkage tractor-implement, two other load cells were mounted, respectively, on the top link and the right point of the three-point hitch of the tool carrier. A portable computer, by means of a Virtual Instrument, developed in LabVIEW environment, acquires the signals of the load cells and of a DGPS mobile receiver. The results of the first tests, carried out in a field in inland Sicily, showed that: the system is able to log data with a sampling frequency adjustable from 1 to 10 Hz; it is able to accurately measure and collect in real-time a large amount of data, which can be easily processed by means of a data sheet, a GIS or another software usable for measuring the within-field spatial variability of soil physical-mechanical parameters; the absolute value of the force measured on the <b>hitch</b> <b>hook</b> of the tool carrier is proportionally correlated to that measured on any point of the three-point hitch of the same one...|$|E
40|$|Electric {{cars have}} {{appeared}} {{as an alternative}} to the big pollution caused by internal combustion engine cars. However, electric cars as the Renault Fluence Z. E. are not very sold in the market because of their small range of autonomy. To make this car an attractive option, it is necessary to add a range extender that extends its autonomy. This range extender is based in the addition of a small internal combustion engine to be attached only when the electric autonomy cannot fulfill the trip. A range extender is chosen by means of a comparison between different electric engines sold in the market. By means of a classification tree, the different places of the car where to mount it are compared and the most appropriate is chosen. By using Solidworks, a structure to support the engine and attach it to the car is designed. The result is a Range Extender device to mount in the <b>hitch</b> <b>hook</b> of the Renault Fluence Z. E. that provides an autonomy of around 665 km. This supposes a good solution for the owner of the Renault Fluence Z. E. who needs to cover trips of more than 180 km, the electric autonomy of this car...|$|E
50|$|The {{skijoring}} line {{is usually}} at least 1.5 metres (8 feet) long. A longer line {{is used for}} a three-dog team. A section of bungee cord is often incorporated into the line to absorb {{the impact of the}} dog's forward motion or a quick stop by the skier. Special quick-release <b>hitches</b> or <b>hooks</b> are available, used so that the skijorer may unhook the dog's lead rapidly.|$|R
60|$|Dick laid {{himself down}} as Surajah had done, and crawled {{backwards}} {{until he was}} lying half over the edge. Then he seized the rope and began to descend, hand over hand. He counted the rungs as he went down, and half way {{he sat down on}} one of the long pieces, <b>hitched</b> the <b>hooks</b> on to the one above, and rested his arms. After a short pause, he continued until he reached the bottom.|$|R
5000|$|A curl route, {{also called}} a <b>hitch</b> or <b>hook</b> (sometimes a button hook), {{is a pattern}} run by a {{receiver}} in American football, where the receiver appears to be running a fly pattern but after a set amount of steps or yards will quickly stop and turn around, looking for a pass. This generally works best when the defending corner or safety commits himself to guarding the fly and is unable to stop quickly enough to defend the pass. A [...] "curl out" [...] on the sideline {{is often referred to}} as a comeback route.|$|R

50|$|The blackwall hitch is a {{temporary}} means of attaching a rope to a hook. Made of a simple half <b>hitch</b> over the <b>hook,</b> it will only hold when subjected to constant tension. It is used when the rope and hook are of equal size, but {{it is likely to}} slip if subjected to more than ordinary tension. Human life should never be trusted to it.|$|R

50|$|There is {{sometimes}} confusion {{about how much}} theoretical mechanical advantage {{is provided by the}} trucker's hitch. If the trucker's hitch were to be used as in the pulley diagram at right, to lift a weight off the floor, the theoretical mechanical advantage would be only 2:1. However in the common use of the trucker's <b>hitch,</b> a static <b>hook,</b> ring, or rail, serves as the lower pulley, and the rope {{across the top of the}} load is the portion being tensioned. Thus, the standing part of the rope is represented by the top anchor point in the diagram, and the theoretical ratio is indeed 3:1 when the working end is tensioned. That is, in a frictionless system, every unit of force exerted on the working end would produce 3 units in the standing part of the rope over the load. In the typical use of the trucker's hitch, where it is used to tighten a rope over a load, when the end is secured to the loop of the Truckers hitch and let go, the tension in the two segments of rope around the ring will rise 50%, unless the rope slackens when it is being tied off, in which case the tension may drop to any value or even zero if enough slack is allowed. But when the trucker's hitch is used as in the diagram, after tying off, the load on the attachment point above the top pulley will drop to 400 lb and the tension in the two lines going to the lower pulley will not change.|$|R
