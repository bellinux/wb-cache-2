25|$|Today, Israel has the world’s most research-intensive {{business}} sector; in 2013, {{it alone}} performed 3.49% of GDP. Competitive grants and tax incentives {{are the two}} main policy instruments supporting business research and development. Thanks to government incentives {{and the availability of}} highly trained human capital, Israel has become an attractive location for the research centres of leading multinationals. The country’s national <b>innovation</b> <b>ecosystem</b> relies on both foreign multinationals and large corporate investors in research and development, as well as on start-ups. According to the Israel Venture Capital Database, 264 foreign research centres are currently active in Israel. Many of these centres are owned by large multinational firms that have acquired Israeli companies, technology and know-how and transformed them through mergers and acquisitions into their own local research facilities. The activity of some research centres even spans more than three decades, such as those of Intel, Applied Materials, Motorola and IBM.|$|E

30|$|Innovations {{continue}} to be achieved through the convergence of different realms and technologies [8]. In these increasingly digital and connected environments, firms face opportunities that they cannot seize alone [9]. There is inherent risk in these innovations because business models are uncertain, costs are high, and new potential competitors emerge in a very fluid business environment [8]. However, the risks can be mitigated in <b>innovation</b> <b>ecosystems</b> through the diversity that increases understanding of new market opportunities and user needs [10]. It has indeed been argued that, despite even the risks involved in managing <b>innovation</b> <b>ecosystems</b> themselves, ecosystems {{will lead to more}} effective implementation and more profitable innovation and that <b>innovation</b> <b>ecosystems</b> allow firms to create value that no single firm could have created alone [11].|$|R

30|$|This paper {{provides}} a multiscopic {{view of the}} relationship infrastructure among businesses in <b>innovation</b> <b>ecosystems</b> of three metropolitan areas: Austin, TX; Twin Cities, MN; and Paris, France. Using triangulated data, the analysis demonstrates how relationship indicators - applied from network metrics {{can be used to}} characterize an ecosystem, with descriptions fitting to this specific context. It combines these with visualization to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze and understand complexities of <b>innovation</b> <b>ecosystems</b> and illuminate opportunities for the development of shared vision through interventions and network orchestration. It uses multiple data sources of cumulative data to create compatible datasets for a multiscopic snapshot exploration. Relational metrics for metropolitan <b>innovation</b> <b>ecosystems</b> are operationalized and analyzed at three levels: deals and alliances among established enterprises, executive and financing relationships among growth companies, and founder and angels relationships among startup companies.|$|R

It may also {{be of interest to}} study in which ways journalists cover innovation processes and <b>innovation</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> the incentives that drive innovation journalism and how news organizations may be organized to perform the task. We outline examples of research project topics to illustrate how this approach can inform studies of innovation, studies of journalism as practice, and possible scopes for the research theme. Going forward, we propose to identify earlier relevant scholarly research and relevant researchers that can be attributed to this emerging research theme in Innovation Journalism...|$|R
