5|$|The {{underlying}} {{legend of}} the jackalope, upon which the Wyoming taxidermists were building, {{may be related to}} similar stories <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>cultures</b> and other historical times. Researchers suggest {{that at least some of}} the tales of horned hares were inspired by sightings of rabbits infected with the Shope papilloma virus. It causes horn- and antler-like tumors to grow in various places on a rabbit's head and body.|$|E
5|$|The {{flagship}} programme develops students' {{interest in learning}} about eastern and western cultures by providing them with opportunities to integrate both cultures and to be immersed <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>cultures,</b> and to have in-depth understanding of the essence of both {{the east and the}} west, thus preparing students to become inclusive talents who are effectively bilingual and able to make strong and meaningful connections with the world. The four-year {{flagship programme}} is mainly made up of two segments, namely 'Broad-Base Curriculum' and 'Peaks of Excellence', which include cultural intelligence and life education to groom students to be world-ready.|$|E
5|$|Other insects {{commonly}} found on great mullein feed exclusively on Verbascum species in general or V.thapsus in particular. They include mullein thrips (Haplothrips verbasci), Gymnaetron tetrum (whose larva consume the seeds) and the mullein moth (Cucullia verbasci). Useful insects are also hosted by great mullein, including predatory mites {{of the genera}} Galendromus, Typhlodromus and Amblyseius, the minute pirate bug Orius tristicolor and the mullein plant bug (Campylomma verbasci). The plant's ability to host both pests and beneficials makes it potentially useful to maintain stable populations of insects used for biological control <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>cultures,</b> like Campylomma verbasci and Dicyphus hesperus (Miridae), a predator of whiteflies. A number of pest Lepidoptera species, including the stalk borer (Papaipema nebris) and gray hairstreak (Strymon melinus), also use V.thapsus as a host plant.|$|E

25|$|The Zappo Zaps did not {{restrict}} their cannibalism to ceremonial occasions, as <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>cultures.</b> Instead they hunted humans for food even when other game was plentiful.

5000|$|The {{result is}} a {{training}} program that makes people more comfortable in working <b>in</b> the <b>other</b> <b>culture.</b> This was tested by assigning trainees randomly to two groups. One group gets the assimilator training, and the other gets geography training, such as what are the physical features of culture A. After the training the trainees go to the <b>other</b> <b>culture</b> {{and the effectiveness of}} their interactions in that culture and the comfort they experience while they live <b>in</b> the <b>other</b> <b>culture</b> is measured. The results show that the assimilator training is helpful. Training does not make the trainee an ambassador, that was too much to hope, but the trained individuals have a better experience <b>in</b> the <b>other</b> <b>culture</b> {{than those who did not}} receive the culture assimilator training.|$|R

25|$|In many cultures, {{flatulence}} {{in public}} {{is regarded as}} embarrassing, but, depending on context, {{can also be considered}} humorous.

25|$|A {{majority}} of married people remain sexually monogamous during their marriages.

25|$|Heterosexuality and {{homosexuality}} are terms {{often used}} in European and American cultures to encompass a person's entire social identity, which includes self and personality.

25|$|Vega and its {{surrounding}} stars are also treated as a constellation <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>cultures.</b> The area corresponding to Lyra was seen by the Arabs as a vulture or an eagle carrying a lyre, either enclosed in its wings, or in its beak.

25|$|In {{cultures}} that value outspokenness and overt confidence, shyness can {{be perceived as}} weakness.

25|$|In {{contrast}} to studies of Western cultures, research <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>cultures</b> has yielded some opposite findings. The landmark INTERHEART Study {{has revealed that}} alcohol consumption in South Asians was not protective against CAD in sharp {{contrast to}} other populations who benefit from it. In fact Asian Indians who consume alcohol had a 60% higher risk of heart attack which was greater with local spirits (80%) than branded spirits (50%). The harm was observed in alcohol users classified as occasional as well as regular light, moderate, and heavy consumers.|$|E

25|$|Skillful use of {{couriers}} enabled these armies {{to maintain}} contact {{with each other}} and their leadership.

These hunts were distinctive from hunts <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>cultures</b> where they were the equivalent to small unit actions. Mongol forces would spread out in a line, surround an entire region, and then drive all of the game within that area together. The goal was to let none of the animals escape and to slaughter them all.|$|E
