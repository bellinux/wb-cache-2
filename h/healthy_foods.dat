After {{receiving}} treatment for KFC withdrawal, Cartman is introduced to Billy Miller, a local boy who runs an illegal KFC cartel from his home. Billy hires Cartman to sell his illegal food, a job that provides Cartman with the same food as payment. After Cartman demonstrates his ruthlessness against a cheating street dealer, Billy sends him and another employee, Tommy, to Corbin, Kentucky to buy chicken directly from Colonel Sanders. Sanders is impressed by Cartman but has Tommy executed after discovering {{him to be a}} mole for <b>healthy</b> <b>foods</b> advocate Jamie Oliver. Cartman wins over the Colonel's trust, but is warned to never betray him. Cartman eventually betrays Billy by telling Billy's mother that he got an F on his social studies test, and takes over the cartel after Billy is grounded. The Colonel assigns Cartman the task of assassinating Oliver to prevent him from giving a speech in the United Nations. However, the gluttonous Cartman soon comes to abuse the KFC food he assigned to sell, and forgets the Colonel's assassination order. The Colonel, furious at Cartman's incompetence, sends a squad of gunmen to kill him, leading to a firefight with the police that kills Billy's mother, and which Cartman escapes unscathed.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Unhealthy {{foods are}} widely {{available}} in public settings across Canada, contributing to diet-related chronic diseases, such as obesity. This is a concern given that public facilities often provide {{a significant amount of}} food for consumption by vulnerable groups, including children and seniors. <b>Healthy</b> <b>food</b> procurement policies, which support procuring, distributing, selling, and/or serving <b>healthier</b> <b>foods,</b> have recently emerged as a promising strategy to counter this public health issue by increasing access to <b>healthier</b> <b>foods.</b> Although numerous Canadian health and scientific organizations have recommended such policies, they have not yet been broadly implemented in Canada. Methods: To inform further policy action on <b>healthy</b> <b>food</b> procurement in a Canadian context, we: (1) conducted an evidence synthesis {{to assess the impact of}} <b>healthy</b> <b>food</b> procurement policies on health outcomes and sales, intake, and availability of <b>healthier</b> <b>food,</b> and (2) hosted a consensus conference in September 2014. The consensus conference invited experts with public health/nutrition policy research expertise, as well as health services and food services practitioner experience, to review evidence, share experiences, and develop a consensus statement/recommendations on <b>healthy</b> <b>food</b> procurement in Canada. Results: Findings from the evidence synthesis and consensus recommendations for <b>healthy</b> <b>food</b> procurement in Canada are described. Specifically, we outline recommendations for governments, publicly funded institutions, decision-makers and professionals, citizens, and researchers. Conclusion: Implementation of <b>healthy</b> <b>food</b> procurement policies can increase Canadians’ access to <b>healthier</b> <b>foods</b> as part of a broader vision for food policy in Canada...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{designed}} to explain how restaurant <b>healthy</b> <b>food</b> quality is related to repeat patronage intention. The results indicate that perceived value mediates the positive relationship between the restaurant <b>healthy</b> <b>food</b> and revisit intent. In other words, restaurant <b>healthy</b> <b>food</b> quality increases perceived value in the diner’s mind, which in turn results in {{a higher level of}} revisit intent. This study also finds green customers are more sensitive to restaurant <b>healthy</b> <b>food</b> quality attributes. For higher green customers, restaurant <b>healthy</b> <b>food</b> quality shows a stronger, positive relationship with repeat patronage intention than for low green customers. Managerial implications are discussed based on the findings for industry practitioners...|$|R
25|$|On 17 October 1557, Wang Zhi {{arrived at}} Zhoushan Island {{with a large}} trading fleet. There he laid down his terms for surrender: he sought an {{imperial}} pardon, a naval commission, and that ports be open for trade; in return he offered to patrol the coast and persuade the raiders {{to return to the}} islands through force if necessary. Hu Zongxian now faced a dilemma: he could not let Wang Zhi go, but if he accepted Wang Zhi's surrender he might be forced to execute him, turning appeasement efforts to naught. In December, confident in his prospects and his invulnerability, Wang Zhi made landing at Hangzhou. There he was accorded respectable treatment by the authorities, who feared antagonizing his followers, while they {{figure out what to do}} with him. During this time Hu Zongxian asked Wang Zhi to help manufacture arquebuses for the Ming army, which led to the weapon being widely used in China. Finally in February next year, Wang Zhi was sent to prison, where he was given the luxuries of novelties, books, and <b>healthy</b> <b>foods.</b> Wang Zhi believed this was a temporary arrangement and remained hopeful for a pardon until 22 January 1560, when an imperial edict handed down the death sentence and he was summarily beheaded.|$|E
25|$|The Food Justice Movement {{has been}} seen as a unique and {{multifaceted}} movement with relevance to the issue of food security. It {{has been described as a}} movement about social-economic and political problems in connection to environmental justice, improved nutrition and health, and activism. Today, a growing number of individuals and minority groups are embracing the Food Justice due to the perceived increase in hunger within nations such as the United States as well as the amplified effect of food insecurity on many minority communities, particularly the Black and Latino communities. A number of organizations have either championed the Food Justice Cause or greatly impacted the Food Justice space. An example of a prominent organization within the food justice movement has been the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, which is a worker-based human rights organization that has been recognized globally for its accomplishments in the areas of human trafficking, social responsibility and gender-based violence at work. The Coalition of Immoaklee Workers most prominent accomplishment related to the food justice space has been its part in implementing the Fair Food Program which increased the pay and bettered working conditions of farm workers in the tomato industry who had been exploited for generations. This accomplishment provided over 30,000 workers more income and the ability to access better and more <b>healthy</b> <b>foods</b> for themselves and their families. Another organization in the food justice space is the Fair Food Network, an organization that has embraced the mission of helping familIes who need healthy food to gain access to it while also increasing the livelihoold for farmers in America and growing local economies. Started by Oran B. Hesterma, the Fair Food Network has invested over $200 million in various projects and initiatives, such as the Double Up Food Bucks program, to help low-income and minority communities access healthier food.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - Insufficient {{attention}} to the specific nature of <b>healthy</b> <b>food</b> experiences might limit the success of related innovations. The {{purpose of this article}} is to adopt a value-in-use perspective to conceptualize <b>healthy</b> <b>food</b> consumption as experiential and emotional, rather than the mere intake of nutrition, and to examine the development of <b>healthy</b> <b>food</b> communication with a service science approach. Design/methodology/approach - With a service science approach, this study proposes a virtual <b>healthy</b> <b>food</b> platform for children. The key data come from internal project documents, workshops with children and other stakeholders (e. g. parents, teachers), and interviews with project team members. Findings - The simultaneity of functional and hedonic benefits, implications for multiple stakeholders, social norms, and need for expertise characterize <b>healthy</b> <b>food</b> experiences. The proposed framework accounts for enablers, principles, outcomes, and challenges affecting the development of communication integral to <b>healthy</b> <b>food</b> experiences, using project data and tools as illustrations. Research limitations/implications - This study contributes to growing literature on service science by introducing key principles and contingency factors that influence the success of experience-centric service innovations. Quantitative research should validate the established framework and investigate the elements' relative usefulness for developing <b>healthy</b> <b>food</b> communication Practical implications - The service science approach involves multiple stakeholders, empathic data collection, and visual tools to develop an entertaining platform to help children learn about <b>healthy</b> <b>food.</b> Originality/value - This research conceptualizes and validates <b>healthy</b> <b>food</b> experiences as value-in-use offerings.

2500|$|Preventing {{obesity and}} {{overweight}} conditions presents a significant opportunity to reduce costs. The Centers for Disease Control reported that approximately 9% of healthcare costs in 1998 were attributable to overweight and obesity, or {{as much as}} $93 billion in 2002 dollars. Nearly half of these costs were {{paid for by the}} government via Medicare or Medicaid. However, by 2008 the CDC estimated these costs had nearly doubled to $147 billion. The CDC identified a series of expensive conditions more likely to occur due to obesity. The CDC released a series of strategies to prevent obesity and overweight, including: making <b>healthy</b> <b>foods</b> and beverages more available; supporting healthy food choices; encouraging kids to be more active; and creating safe communities to support physical activity. An estimated 26% of U.S. adults in 2007 were obese, versus 24% in 2005. State obesity rates ranged from 18% to 30%. Obesity rates were roughly equal among men and women.

40|$|International audienceTaking {{into account}} how people value the {{healthiness}} and tastiness of food {{at both the}} behavioral and brain levels may help to better understand and address overweight and obesity-related issues. Here, we investigate whether brain activity in those areas involved in self-control may increase significantly when individuals with a high body-mass index (BMI) focus their attention on the taste {{rather than on the}} health benefits related to <b>healthy</b> <b>food</b> choices. Under such conditions, BMI is positively correlated with both the neural responses to <b>healthy</b> <b>food</b> choices in those brain areas associated with gustation (insula), reward value (orbitofrontal cortex), and self-control (inferior frontal gyrus), and with the percent of <b>healthy</b> <b>food</b> choices. By contrast, when attention is directed towards health benefits, BMI is negatively correlated with neural activity in gustatory and reward-related brain areas (insula, inferior frontal operculum). Taken together, these findings suggest that those individuals with a high BMI do not necessarily have reduced capacities for self-control but that they may be facilitated by external cues that direct their attention toward the tastiness of <b>healthy</b> <b>food.</b> Thus, promoting the taste of <b>healthy</b> <b>food</b> in communication campaigns and/or food packaging may lead to more successful self-control and <b>healthy</b> <b>food</b> behaviors for consumers with a higher BMI, an issue which needs to be further researched...|$|R
40|$|Objective : Examine {{the cost}} of <b>healthy</b> <b>food</b> habits for welfare-dependent {{families}} in Australia. Method :  A seven-day meal plan was developed, based on Australian public health recommendations, for two typical welfare-dependent families: a couple-family (two adults, two children) and a one-parent family (one adult, two children). The cost of the meal plan was calculated using market brand and generic brand grocery items, and total cost compared to income. Results : In Australia, {{the cost of}} <b>healthy</b> <b>food</b> habits uses about 40 % of the disposable income of welfare-dependent families. Families earning an average income would spend only 20 % of their disposable income to buy the same <b>healthy</b> <b>food.</b> Substituting generic brands for market brands reduced the weekly food cost by about 13 %. This is one of few economic models to include generic brands. Conclusion : Compared with average-income Australian families, <b>healthy</b> <b>food</b> habits are a fiscal challenge to welfare-dependent families.
