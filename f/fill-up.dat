40|$|International audienceThe {{assessment}} of nominal effort {{is a key}} issue for the estimation of total catches. However, in many datacollection systems, total effort is inferred from sampling schemes at landing points or calculated from fishing forms or logbooks, which do not provide accurate information on a vessel's fishing activity. This problem is especially significant in small-scale fleets where fishers' behaviour and related fishing activity are heterogeneous. As fuel consumption by fishers is often subject to tax relief, it is registered by administration {{and can be used}} to improve and cross-check nominal effort measures (hours at sea, days at sea). This paper presents a methodology developed, using this type of dataset, for French West Indies fisheries. The protocol implemented was in three steps and used different data sources. First, a statistical analysis of engine power, engine type, and fuel consumption per métier was carried out based on field studies and fleet register information. Second, an algorithm was developed in order to estimate the number of trips and engine hours per vessel from vessel fuel consumption and vessel tank <b>fill-ups,</b> registered by the administration. Third, these estimates were used to provide a first {{assessment of}} the fleet landings per species and discuss the use of this information for calculation of revenue and running cost per trip, including fuel costs.

40|$|This master thesis has {{investigated}} feasibility of effective well control in riserless drilling. An attempt was undertaken {{to design a}} realistic model of riserless well using advanced multiphase simulation tool and evaluate well control aspects as loss of primary well control, kick detection and well killing operations. One {{of the most significant}} findings in this study is that the well control procedures, which were specially developed for riserless and dual gradient application, do not work as expected. Modified Driller’s method and detection of shut-in drill pipe pressure after well is shut with HCV did not show desired results during simulations and must be revised. With unknown formation pressure it is impossible to circulate kick out of the well and pump the kill mud into the wellbore safely. And both Driller’s and Wait and Weight methods are not applicable. Therefore, well control operation in riserless drilling cannot be executed safely and in controlled manner using current technologies and procedures. Kick detection in riserless system is similar to conventional drilling. Almost all conventional kick detection methods are applicable in riserless drilling and allow detecting the kick effectively. The speed of the subsea pump also proved to be an effective method, which can be used in addition to conventional ones. However, {{it is not possible to}} perform a flow check and fluid <b>fill-ups</b> on trips to verify that kick is taken. It was also shown that the new equipment with complex control logic–hydraulic control valve is a very critical element of riserless drilling system. It is installed at the bottom of the drill string, which creates restriction for its maintenance. Effectiveness of the well control relies solely on HCV in the situation when the well must be shut-in. Therefore, the fact that HCV is the single point of failure is considerable disadvantage of the riserless system. The results of this study indicate that new well control procedures for riserless drilling require a high level of understanding of wellbore fluids influence on conditions in the well. Therefore, further development and utilization of model that was established in OLGA is important. It is also recommended that further research be undertaken in the following areas: Back-up emergency procedures for failure of the hydraulic control valve, subsea pump or both of them. Alternative well control procedures for the situation when the bit is not on the bottom. Research and development of the subsea pump so that new system would have high degree of operational flexibility to act not only as a pump but also as an analog of subsea choke during drilling, tripping and well control operations. Prior to development of the technical solutions and procedures it is highly recommended to enhance accuracy of the model and simulation software. OLGA multiphase phase flow simulator is intensively validated against field data for subsea multiphase flow lines, production riser systems and gas condensate pipelines. For the drilling systems, the extensive validation campaign against the field data is required to increase the confidence in the simulations results. This could be achieved through the cooperation between leading oil companies via JIPs. In addition operator training simulators could potentially help with such a complex and dynamic phenomena. The verified (for long vertical risers/pipes, with viscous mud) multiphase flow simulator could be integrated to the drilling simulator. This online system could potentially predict the behavior of the flow during the gas kick in the system during the drilling operation and will provide more time to react (as analogy to the OLGA/Hysys or Leda/K-Spice online integrated systems for the process/transport systems). </p...|$|R

50|$|Swabbing is as {{a result}} of the upward {{movement}} of pipe in a well and results in a decrease in bottomhole pressure. In some cases, the bottomhole pressure reduction can be large enough to cause the well to go underbalanced and allow formation fluids to enter the wellbore. The initial swabbing action compounded by the reduction in hydrostatic pressure(from formation fluids entering the well) can lead to a significant reduction in bottomhole pressure and a larger influx of formation fluids. Therefore, early detection of swabbing on trips is critical to minimizing the size of a kick.Many wellbore conditions increase the likelihood of swabbing on a trip. Swabbing (piston) action is enhanced when pipe is pulled too fast. Poor fluid properties, such as high viscosity and gel strengths, also increase the chances of swabbing a well in. Additionally, large outside diameter (OD) tools (packers, scrapers, fishing tools, etc.) enhance the piston effect.These conditions need to be recognized in order to decrease the likelihood of swabbing a well in during completion/workover operations. As mentioned earlier, there are several computer and calculator programs that can estimate surge and swab pressures. Swabbing is detected by closely monitoring hole <b>fill-up</b> volumes during trips. For example, if three barrels of steel (tubing) are removed from the well and it takes only two barrels of fluid to fill the hole, then a one barrel kick has probably been swabbed into the wellbore. Special attention should be paid to hole <b>fill-up</b> volumes since statistics indicate that most kicks occur on trips.|$|E
