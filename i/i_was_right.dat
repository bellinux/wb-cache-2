That's how I won the case. Madhubala did come to my house to apologise and say she was really helpless, but that's okay. I have no complaints.|$|E

DeWitt {{was given a}} recurring role in the season as Don's mistress, which lasted for six episodes. She initially felt out of place while playing out her character. DeWitt stated, [...] "They were {{at the end of}} casting, and hadn't found the right Midge yet. Originally they had a scene where she opens the door wearing a red kimono, and I remember thinking 'I'm not that', so I wasn’t sure <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> for the part.

500|$|When Johnston {{was up for}} {{re-election}} in 1877, {{he was involved in}} the controversial Texas-Pacific Bill, a battle between Northern and Southern railroad interests. Johnston was opposed to Tom Scott's Texas and Pacific Railway, and the bill, which favored Scott's interests. Scott was trying to persuade Southern states to accept his railroad so that they would subsequently appoint senators who would vote for the bill. Johnston's seat was vulnerable if Scott succeeded in influencing the Virginia legislature, as it was known that he opposed the bill. As Johnston wrote in a letter, [...] "...what I have done about the Pacific road is before the people and I cannot recall it if I would. It would not be policy to retreat from my position nor am I inclined to do so, if was policy. I thought & I think that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> & am therefore ready to take the consequences. I intend to fight it out on that line." [...] William Mahone worked to prevent his re-election. Most Southern states went along with Scott, but Virginia and Louisiana did not, and Johnston was re-elected.|$|E

Reviewing his own political battles, the poet identified such support for innovation with the rejection of isolationism: [...] "I write these words, these consoled, gentle, tired words, after a violent campaign. And I am tranquil when noting that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> after all, in maintaining that, to us Romanians, modernism is the only force that may lead to a victory.

According to Watson, [...] "Since an early age I've had an in-built premonition, a vision that I wouldn't make 40.

[...] Watson recalled that the tumours were [...] "like a figure of eight, one filling the frontal cavity of my skull, the other forced through into the top of my nose."
