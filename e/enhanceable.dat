Only one amino acid in the mAb epitopes proximal to the crown of the V 3 loop was different among these three strains. Substitution of this amino acid in the neutralizable strain with the amino acid of the neutralization-resistant strain or the <b>enhanceable</b> strain resulted in loss of both activities.

METHODS: Expression of CCN 2 /CTGF, p-STAT 3, p-Smad 3 / 1 and p-Smad 2 was examined in primary freshly isolated rat or cryo-preserved human PC exposed to various stimuli by Western blotting, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), reporter-gene-assays and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: IL- 6 strongly down-regulated CCN 2 /CTGF protein and mRNA expression in PC, <b>enhanceable</b> by extracellular presence of the soluble IL- 6 receptor gp 80, and supported by an inverse relation between IL- 6 and CCN 2 /CTGF concentrations in patients’ sera. The inhibition of TGFβ 1 driven CCN 2 /CTGF expression by IL- 6 did not involve a modulation of Smad 2 (and Smad 1 / 3) signalling. However, the STAT 3 SH 2 domain binding peptide, a selective inhibitor of STAT 3 DNA binding activity, counteracted the inhibitory effect of IL- 6 on CCN 2 /CTGF expression much more pronounced than pyrrolidine-dithiocarbamate, an inhibitor primarily of STAT 3 phosphorylation. An EMSA confirmed STAT 3 binding to the proposed proximal STAT binding site in the CCN 2 /CTGF promoter.

40|$|Due to the {{severity}} of system-wide power outages, though their probability of occurrence is slight, regulatory authorities require that a system restoration plan be drawn up and {{kept up to date}} at all times. The power outage that affected northeastern North America in 2003 proved the need for such a requirement. The particular structure of Hydro-Québec's power system requires the use of a highly specific system restoration procedure. The daily preparation of the system restoration plan is based on a strategy whose application requires that a restoration sequence be drawn up that uses available equipment, the electrical behavior of which has been validated using appropriate studies. Over the years, Hydro-Québec has accumulated a sizeable pool of knowledge that brings together all the solutions already studied. System restoration planners use their know-how to find the best solution, determine whether it is appropriate, and proceed to apply it. When required, new solutions must be developed. The new RECRÉ software program (French acronym for “Remise En Charge du Réseau” – System Restoration) has been implemented by Hydro-Québec in 2005. The aim of this knowledge management system is to have system restoration knowledge become a tangible, growth-oriented and <b>enhanceable</b> asset. The system is made up of two modules: the knowledge engineering module, whereby modeling can be done of the system restoration strategy and known solutions in a knowledge base, and the planning module, whereby system restoration plans can be drawn up based on the unavailability of power system equipment.

40|$|The {{infectivity}} of 16 {{strains of}} Klebsiella spp. and its modification by systemic and local ferric iron {{were tested in}} {{the skin of the}} guinea-pig. The in vivo proliferation of 11 strains was enhanced in varying degrees by Fe+++ (E + strains); 5 strains (Eo) were not <b>enhanceable</b> even by large doses of Fe+++. Of 10 strains examined in detail, 6 were E + and 4 were E 0. Guinea-pig and human sera were consistently bacteriostatic for E + strains and bactericidal for Eo strains. Both Fe+++ and microbial iron-chelators abolished the bacteriostasis of E + strains but did not affect the lethal effect on Eo strains. Both effects were diminished by heating the sera to 56 degrees for 30 min and by the anticomplementary substance Liquoid; neither appeared to be due to specific antibody. Virulence, as measured in the skin and by intravenous injection, was roughly associated with degree of enhanceability by iron, the EO strains being among the least virulent. The volume of plasma exudate entering the skin during the first 5 h was sufficient to kill {{a large proportion of the}} infecting doses of Eo strains and to inhibit the growth of infecting doses of E + strains. Enhancement of the latter by Fe+++ is predominantly the result of inhibition of the non-specific bacteriostasis exerted by the extravascular plasma. Lesions by E + strains aged 4 h or more are insusceptible to systemic Fe+++ and only moderately susceptible to large doses of local Fe+++. The insusceptibility appears to be due to segregation of the infecting bacilli within exudate leucocytes. Klebsiella infections accordingly provide another example of an initial decisive period of action of the antibacterial defences-in this case non-specific and humoral-which cease to be locally effective after the first few hours. Besides enhancing lesions due to E + strains, systemic Fe+++ has an opposite, apparently anti-inflammatory action on klebsiella lesions, slightly decreasing their size. It was evident with all the strains tested, whether dead or alive, but not in E + lesions in circumstances when they were susceptible to enhancement by the Fe+++...|$|E
