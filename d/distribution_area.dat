40|$|Abstract. The cassava green mite(Mononychellus mcgregori) {{was listed}} as a {{quarantine}} pest in the world. The risk of invasion of M. mcgregori was on the increasing {{with the development of}} foreign trade, especially in Guangxi province, China. Therefore the prediction of geographic <b>distribution</b> <b>areas</b> and pest risk analysis should be done urgently. In this paper potential geographic <b>distribution</b> <b>areas</b> of M. mcgregori in Guangxi were predicted with niche model MaxEnt. Through validating prediction result and analyzing technical parameter AUC-value, it is sure that niche model MaxEnt is suitable for predicting potential <b>distribution</b> <b>areas</b> of M. mcgregori in Guangxi.

Interference between native and non-native cockroach species was evaluated here by comparing their <b>distribution</b> <b>areas</b> in two oceanic islands: Mayotte and La Reunion. A factorial correspondence analysis showed that their presence is related to environmental parameters among which human activity, humidity and altitude are the three most important. Human activity and humidity favour establishment and development of non-native species, whereas altitude limits their presence. Non-native species form guilds (up to seven species). Their <b>distribution</b> <b>areas</b> overlap and illustrate their colonizing capacities. On the contrary, <b>distribution</b> <b>areas</b> of native species never overlap, although some co-occur with non-native species.

40|$|The {{results from}} acoustic-trawl surveys in January-March were {{analyzed}} together with observations of bottom temperatures {{at the same}} cruises. Estimates of abundance of cod within temperature intervals of one degree were calculated for each age group, and distributions of abundance on temperature were established. The analysis showed that the older age groups, fish aged 6 and 7 years, were consistently found in warmer water, i. e. farther west, than the younger fish. The variations in bottom temperatures of the <b>distribution</b> <b>areas</b> appeared to be larger for the younger fish, age group 1, than for the older age groups. Year to year variations of weighted mean bottom temperatures in the actual <b>distribution</b> <b>areas</b> of the various age groups were compared with corresponding variations in two fixed areas and in the Kola section. The comparison showed that the temperature variations in fixed locations only {{to a certain extent}} reflected the variations in the actual environmental conditions of the fish.

25|$|The main habitat {{threat to}} Chinese black bears is overcutting of forests, {{largely due to}} human populations {{increasing}} to over 430,000 in regions where bears are distributed, in the Shaanxi, Ganshu, and Sichuan provinces. 27 forestry enterprises were built in these areas between 1950 and 1985 (excluding the lumbering units belonging to the county). By the early 1990s, the black bear <b>distribution</b> <b>area</b> was reduced to only one-fifth of the area that existed before the 1940s. Isolated bear populations face environmental and genetic stress in these circumstances. However, {{one of the most}} important reasons for their decrease involves overhunting, as black bear paws, gall bladders and cubs have great economic value. Black bear harvests are maintained at a high level due to the harm they cause to crops, orchards and bee farms. During the 1950s and 1960s, 1000 bears were harvested annually in the Heilongjiang Province. However, purchased furs were reduced by 4/5, even by 9/10 yearly in the late 1970s to the early 1980s. Bears have also been declining annually in Dehong Dai and Jingpo Nations Autonomous Prefecture and the Yunnan Province.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. This study, {{conducted}} from June 1996 to July 1997, {{was directed}} at determining the abiotic environmental factors governing {{the distribution of the}} bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and the pan-tropical spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata) in Golfo Dulce. The spotted dolphin was associated with significantly deeper zones (t-test =- 9. 761; p < 0. 001, n = 202) and with higher salinity (t-test =- 3. 538; p = 0. 001; n = 202) than the bottlenose dolphin. The combi-nation of environmental variables in the <b>distribution</b> <b>areas</b> of each species in Golfo Dulce was different, both spatially (F = 9. 724, df = 12; p < 0. 001) and seasonally (F = 9. 735; df = 12; p < 0. 001). Of all the environmental variables considered, Multiple Discriminant Analysis showed depth to be the main factor differenciating the <b>distribution</b> <b>areas</b> of the two species. The relationship between group size in each species, depth, and the location of their <b>distribution</b> <b>areas</b> in relation to the shore were analyzed and evidence regarding these aspects and variations in foraging strategies and prey composition was proposed to explain the differences found in their spatial distributions. Seasonal variations in salinity in the <b>distribution</b> <b>areas</b> and their inverse relationship with the time of the year were analyzed in relation to their possible combined effects on prey composition during different seasons in order to explain the seasonal variations in distribution patterns. Key words: cetaceans, environmental factors, distribution patterns, bottlenose dolphin, spotted dolphin, Costa Rica.
