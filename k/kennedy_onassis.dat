50|$|Along Broadway, the Townsend (1896) and St. James (1896) {{were the}} tallest {{buildings}} in New York {{for a short}} while, and remain historic landmarks. Slightly up the street, the Baudouine Building at 28th Street was heavily decorated with escutcheons of anthemions with lion heads over many windows. At the same corner, the Johnston Building (now the Hotel NoMad) was built in 1900 and faced in all limestone with beautiful exterior decoration. One block up, Jacqueline <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Onassis’s</b> grandfather built a classically designed loft building, next to the Breslin.|$|R

5|$|A set of {{fourteen}} redesigned Major Arcana tarot cards, {{based on the}} Rider-Waite deck, were commissioned by the singer for the album's artwork. The cards depict band members in surrealistic tableau. Each card was reinterpreted to reflect the iconography of the album's lyrical content: The Fool is stepping off a cliff, with grainy images of Jacqueline <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Onassis</b> and a JFK campaign poster in the background; The Emperor, with prosthetic legs, {{is sitting in a}} wheelchair clutching a rifle in front of an American flag; Justice weighs the Bible against the brain on his balance scale. The album's inner sleeve contains these three images, along with a further nine: The Magician, The High Priestess, The Hierophant, The Hermit, Death, The Devil, The Tower, The Star and The World.

5000|$|The house {{belonged to}} Jacqueline <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Onassis's</b> {{paternal}} grandparents John Vernou Bouvier Jr. (referred to as [...] "the Major") and Maude Sergeant Bouvier. The Bouviers' first summer residence in East Hampton {{was a simple}} house called Wildmoor, on Apaquogue Road in Georgica, which the Major bought about 1910. In 1925 the Major's wife, Maude Sergeant (whose family line traces back to the Kent, England origins of East Hampton) bought the house. In 1926 the Bouviers joined the Maidstone Club. The Major was to formally buy the house from his wife in 1935 after inheriting money from his uncle Michel Charles [...] "M. C." [...] Bouvier.|$|R

5000|$|Born in Lille in 1955, Serge Cajfinger {{spent his}} {{childhood}} in Brazil; he returned to France in 1968. In 1974, he opened a multi-brand store in Lille known as PAULE KA. Serge Cajfinger later left Lille for Paris {{to set up a}} designer label under the same name, opening the first ever PAULE KA store in 1987 in the heart of Paris’ Marais district. Inspired by the grace and elegance of 50’s and 60’s style icons including Jackie <b>Onassis</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> Audrey Hepburn and Princess Grace Kelly, he sought to bring a modern twist to their timeless elegance. The brand's style is geometric and sober, sophisticated yet urban, with some lasting characteristics such as black dresses, must-have bags [...] and the use of bows.|$|R
2500|$|The First Lady {{was deeply}} {{affected}} by the death and entered a state of depression afterward. However, losing their child had {{a positive impact on}} the marriage, bringing the couple closer together in their shared grief. Arthur Schlesinger wrote that while President Kennedy always [...] "regarded Jacqueline with genuine affection and pride," [...] their marriage [...] "never seemed more solid than in the later months of 1963." [...] Aware of her depression, <b>Kennedy's</b> friend Aristotle <b>Onassis</b> invited her to his yacht. Despite President Kennedy initially having reservations, he reportedly believed that it would be [...] "good for her." [...] The trip was widely disapproved of within the Kennedy administration and by much of the general public, as well as in Congress. The First Lady returned to the United States on October 17, 1963. She would later say she regretted being away as long as she was, but had been [...] "melancholy after the death of my baby." ...|$|R

50|$|In the 1970s, Jacqueline Onassis's sister Lee Radziwill {{discussed}} {{creating a}} documentary with Albert and David Maysles {{about her and}} Jacqueline's childhood in East Hampton. At about the same time, the Edies received national attention when the National Enquirer ran an exposé on the deplorable conditions in which they lived. The Suffolk County, New York, Board of Health made an inspection, ordering them {{to clean up the}} property, which was falling into disrepair and contained various cats, raccoons, an opossum, et cetera. The once-elegant grounds were a tangled jungle; 25 of the 28 rooms were unused; in the dining room, they found a three-foot mountain of empty cans; in the upstairs bedrooms, it was said they saw human waste; and the fleas were so thick that the filmmakers wore flea collars around their ankles during the filming. After the publicity, Jacqueline <b>Kennedy</b> and Aristotle <b>Onassis</b> donated $32,000 to clean the house, install a new furnace and plumbing system, and cart away 1,000 bags of garbage. Beale did not have the funds for trash removal and house repairs. Beale's sons agreed to pay the back taxes on the property, which they had hoped for decades their mother would sell. After the stressful raids by county officials, Beale never left her home again in fear that she would lose permanent legal access to her house.|$|R
5000|$|Guy and Youngman {{eventually}} {{buy tickets}} for the luxury liner The Magic Christian, along with the richest strata of society. Guests seen boarding the yacht include John Lennon and Yoko Ono, and Jacqueline <b>Kennedy</b> and Aristotle <b>Onassis</b> (all played by lookalikes). In the beginning everything appears normal and the ship apparently sets off. Soon, things start going wrong. A solitary drinker at the bar (Roman Polanski) is approached by a transvestite cabaret singer (Yul Brynner), a vampire (Christopher Lee) poses as a waiter, and a cinema film features the unsuccessful transplant of a black person's head onto a white person's body. Passengers start noticing, through the ship's closed-circuit television, that their captain (Wilfrid Hyde-White) is in a drunken stupor and gets carted off by a gorilla. In a crescendo of panic, the guests try to abandon ship. A group of them, shown the way by Youngman Grand, instead reach the machine-room. There, the Priestess of the Whip (Raquel Welch), assisted by two topless drummers, commands {{more than a hundred}} slave girls. They are naked except for loincloths. Rowing five to an oar, their wrists are manacled and fastened by chains to the ceiling. As passengers finally find an exit, and lords and ladies stumble out in the daylight, it is discovered that the supposed ship was in fact a structure built inside a warehouse, and the passengers had never left London. As they break out, a large painted sign reading 'SMASH CAPITALISM" [...] can be seen on the inside wall of the warehouse. During the whole misadventure, the Grands look perfectly composed and cool.|$|R
2500|$|In 1957, {{while still}} married to husband Giovanni Battista Meneghini, Callas was {{introduced}} to Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis at a party given in her honor by Elsa Maxwell after a performance in Donizetti's Anna Bolena. The affair that followed received much publicity in the popular press, and in November 1959, Callas left her husband. Michael Scott asserts that Onassis was not why Callas largely abandoned her career, but that he offered her {{a way out of}} a career that was made increasingly difficult by scandals and by vocal resources that were diminishing at an alarming rate. Franco Zeffirelli, on the other hand, recalls asking Callas in 1963 why she had not practiced her singing, and Callas responding that [...] "I have been trying to fulfill my life as a woman." [...] According to one of her biographers, Nicholas Gage, Callas and Onassis had a child, a boy, who died hours after he was born on March 30, 1960. In his book about his wife, Meneghini states categorically that Maria Callas was unable to bear children. As well, various sources dismiss Gage's claim, as they note that the birth certificates Gage used to prove this [...] "secret child" [...] were issued in 1998, twenty-one years after Callas's death. Still other sources claim that Callas had at least one abortion while involved with Onassis. In 1966, Callas renounced her U.S. citizenship at the American Embassy in Paris, to facilitate the end of her marriage to Meneghini. This was because after her renunciation, she was only a Greek citizen, and under Greek law a Greek could only legally marry in a Greek Orthodox church. As she had married in a Roman Catholic church, this divorced her in every country except Italy. The renunciation also helped her finances, as she no longer had to pay US taxes on her income. The relationship ended two years later in 1968, when Onassis left Callas in favor of Jacqueline <b>Kennedy.</b> However, the <b>Onassis</b> family's private secretary, Kiki, writes in her memoir that even while Aristotle was with Jackie, he frequently met up with Maria in Paris, where they resumed what had now become a clandestine affair.|$|R
