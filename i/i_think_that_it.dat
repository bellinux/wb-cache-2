That's not, like, a revelation – you knew {{just by looking}} at her… She would have died eventually, the way she was going, but what really killed her was the bulimia… <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> left her weaker and more susceptible. Had she not had an eating disorder, she would have been physically stronger.|$|E

They have indicated {{they are going to}} fuss more about the pictures in which I appear. I think I'll enjoy being fussed about... I want this to be the turning point and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will. I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. I've had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves haven't been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think they've all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, and that is what I am going to fight for if necessary, though I don't believe it will be because they are so understanding here at Paramount.|$|E

Of course, if he's too friendly with me, then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> hurts his other relatives. He was very loyal to his mother. That was the first thing that was in his mind." [...] Nevertheless, she and Sean attended the opening of Julian's photo exhibition at the Morrison Hotel in New York City in 2010, appearing for the first time for photos with Cynthia and Julian. She also promoted the exhibition on her website, and Julian and Sean are close.|$|E

500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole {{was pleased}} that the writers decided to let her {{character}} discover Walter's secret, commenting [...] "Astrid finds out in a really emotional way because Walter lets it slip to her accidentally. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was really nice for them to invite Astrid into the importance of that instead of keeping her in the dark. At least she knows that she's {{a part of this}} family and this affects her. I think she serves as a really important character in these later episodes because Astrid is kind of the only person that isn't directly involved with everything that is still on his side. She has {{to step up to the}} plate and be that comfort for him because if he doesn't have anyone there, he's basically going to regress and go back to the place, I think mentally, that he was in when he was in the mental institution. And of course we don't want that." ...|$|E
500|$|Lennon became {{convinced}} that the Maharishi, {{who said he was}} celibate, had made a pass at Farrow or was having relations with other young female students and later called the Maharishi a [...] "lecherous womaniser". [...] According to Mardas an American teacher named Rosalyn Bonas had told both him and Lennon that the Maharishi had made [...] "sexual advances" [...] towards her. However, Cynthia Lennon said she thought Mardas had put the [...] "young and impressionable" [...] girl up to it. Brown recalls that Mardas told him that a young blonde nurse from California had said she'd had a sexual relationship with the Maharishi. In addition, Mardas arranged to spy on the Maharishi when Bonas was with him, and said that he saw the two of them in a compromising position. At the same time, {{many of the people who}} were there, including Harrison, Horn, Cooke de Herrera, Cynthia Lennon and Jennie Boyd did not believe that the Maharishi had made a pass at any woman. According to Cynthia Lennon, Mardas' allegations about the Maharishi's indiscretions with a lady gained momentum [...] "without a single shred of evidence or justification." [...] Likewise McCartney said [...] "It was Magic Alex who made the original accusation and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was completely untrue".|$|E
500|$|The American film {{reviewer}} Leonard Maltin {{has suggested}} that {{if it had been}} Connery in the leading role instead of Lazenby, On Her Majesty's Secret Service would have epitomised the series. On the other hand, Danny Peary wrote, [...] "I'm not sure I agree with those who insist that if Connery had played Bond it would definitely be the best of the entire Bond series... Connery's Bond, with his boundless humor and sense of fun and self-confidence, would be out of place in this picture. It actually works better with Lazenby because he is incapable of playing Bond as a bigger-than-life hero; for one thing he hasn't the looks... Lazenby's Bond also hasn't the assurance of Connery's Bond and that is appropriate in the crumbling, depressing world he finds himself. He seems vulnerable and jittery at times. At the skating rink, he is actually scared. We worry about him... On Her Majesty's Secret Service doesn't have Connery and it's impossible to ever fully adjust to Lazenby, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> still might be the best Bond film, as many Bond cultists claim." [...] Peary also described On Her Majesty's Secret Service as [...] "the most serious", [...] "the most cynical" [...] and [...] "the most tragic" [...] of the Bond films.|$|E

Bourdieu held that these geometric techniques of data analysis are, like his sociology, inherently relational. [...] "I use Correspondence Analysis very much, because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is essentially a relational procedure whose philosophy fully expresses what in my view constitutes social reality. It is a procedure that 'thinks' in relations, as I try to do it with the concept of field," [...] Bourdieu said, in the preface to The Craft of Sociology.|$|E

Allegra is said to have written: [...] "I hold that the work of Valtorta demands a supernatural origin. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is the product of one or more charisma and that it should be studied {{in the light of the}} doctrine of charisma." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{the origin}} of the name Prufrock is not certain, and Eliot never remarked on its origin other than to claim he was unsure of how he came upon the name. [...] Many {{scholars}} and indeed Eliot himself have pointed towards the autobiographical elements in the character of Prufrock, and Eliot at the time of writing the poem was in the habit of rendering his name as [...] "T.Stearns Eliot," [...] very similar in form to that of J. Alfred Prufrock. It is suggested that the name [...] "Prufrock" [...] came from Eliot's youth in St. Louis, Missouri, where the Prufrock-Litton Company, a large furniture store, occupied one city block downtown at 420–422 North Fourth Street. In a 1950 letter, Eliot said, [...] "I did not have, at the time of writing the poem, and have not yet recovered, any recollection of having acquired this name in any way, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> must be assumed that I did, and that the memory has been obliterated." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the mid-1970s}} {{it has been}} argued by revisionist historians that the style {{attracted}} the attention, in the early 1950s, of the CIA, who saw it as representative of the USA as a haven of free thought and free markets, as well as a challenge to both the socialist realist styles prevalent in communist nations and the dominance of the European art markets. The book by Frances Stonor Saunders, The Cultural Cold War—The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters, (published in the UK as Who Paid the Piper?: CIA and the Cultural Cold War) details how the CIA financed and organized the promotion of American abstract expressionists as part of cultural imperialism via the Congress for Cultural Freedom from 1950 to 1967. Notably Robert Motherwell's series Elegy to the Spanish Republic addressed some of those political issues. Tom Braden, founding chief of the CIA's International Organizations Division (IOD) and ex-executive secretary of the Museum of Modern Art said in an interview, [...] "I think it was the most important division that the agency had, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> played an enormous role in the Cold War." ...|$|E

His parents disapproved of the idea, Zemeckis later said, [...] "But only in the sense that they were concerned... for my [...] family and my friends and the world that I grew up in, this was the kind of dream that really was impossible.
