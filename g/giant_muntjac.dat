2500|$|The park {{is home to}} {{significant}} populations of primates in Vietnam, with ten species and sub-species. These include the globally vulnerable pig-tailed macaque, Assam macaque, stump-tailed macaque and white-cheeked crested gibbon (Nomascus leucogenys and Nomascus leucogenys siki). The park is probably home to the largest population of François' langur in Vietnam, including two different forms of the species. The area is highly significant for its population of Hatinh langur and black langur. It is undoubtedly the largest population of these species in the world, and probably the only population represented in a protected area. Other endangered large mammals include the mainland serow (Capricornis sumatraensis), <b>giant</b> <b>muntjac</b> (Megamuntiacus vuquangensis) and possibly the saola (Pseudoryx nghetinhensis). The Asian black bear (Selenarctos thibetanus) and sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) are confirmed. Other smaller mammals include Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica) and the recently discovered striped hare, called locally [...] "tho van" [...] (Nesolagus timminsii). Ten bat species listed in the IUCN List of Threatened Species have been recorded in this park.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>muntjac.</b> {{sometimes}} referred to as the large-antlered muntjac (Muntiacus vuquangensis), is a species of muntjac deer. It is the largest muntjac species and was discovered in 1994 in Vũ Quang, Hà Tĩnh Province of Vietnam and in central Laos. During inundation of the Nakai Reservoir in Khammouane Province of Laos for the Nam Theun 2 Multi-Purpose Project, 38 <b>giant</b> <b>muntjac</b> were captured, studied and released into the adjacent Nakai-Nam Theun National Protected Area. Subsequent radio-tracking of a sample of these animals showed the relocation was successful. [...] The species is also located in parts of eastern Cambodia, as well as the Trường Sơn Mountains.|$|E
50|$|Species of mammals, some {{discovered}} relatively recently, {{include the}} following (Robichaud 2005): saola, <b>giant</b> <b>muntjac,</b> Roosevelt's muntjac, Truong Son muntjac, Indochinese warty pig, Heude's pig, Annamite striped rabbit, Javan rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus annamiticus), Indochinese tiger, and Asian elephant.|$|E
50|$|The native {{forests of}} Nam Kading host a large variety {{of animals and}} birds, {{including}} endangered species. At least 43 mammal species and 234 bird species have been catalogued. Animal species include both northern and southern white-cheeked gibbon, sun bear, gaur, tiger, elephant and <b>giant</b> <b>muntjac.</b>|$|E

Six new mammal species, including the saola, <b>giant</b> <b>muntjac</b> and Tonkin snub-nosed monkey have also been discovered, along with one new bird species, the endangered Edwards's pheasant. In the late 1980s, a small population of Javan rhinoceros was found in Cát Tiên National Park. However, the last individual of the species in Vietnam was reportedly shot in 2010.|$|E
50|$|At , the Nakai-Nam Theun National Biodiversity Conservation Area in Bolikhamsai and Khammouane Provinces is {{the third}} largest {{protected}} area in Laos. It comprises mixed semi-tropical forests (reported in large areas of Indochina. The wetlands of the Nam Kading National Protected Area and the Phou Khao Khouay National Protected Area attract numerous migratory birds, and also has some 13 globally and 12 regionally endangered mammals such as the Asiatic black bear, clouded leopard, elephant, <b>giant</b> <b>muntjac,</b> gaur, sun bear, and tiger and both northern and southern white-cheeked crested gibbon. The saola (spindle horn) or Vii Quang ox (Pseudoryx nghetinhensis) was discovered in neighbouring Vietnam in 1992 and sighted since then in this conservation area. In 1996, the saola was discovered living in the adjoining Khammouane Province.|$|E
50|$|The {{wildlife}} of Vietnam {{is rich in}} {{flora and}} fauna as reflected by its unique biodiversity. Rare and endemic antelope-like animal, categorized under the bovine subfamily, was found in 1992, in Bạch Mã National Park. In the 1990s, three other large mammal species, the deer-like Truong Son muntjac, <b>giant</b> <b>muntjac</b> and Pu Hoat muntjac, were also discovered, the first two in the same park. Conservation protection and scientific studies of the ecology of Vietnam, particularly in the protected forest areas, have been given priority attention by the Government of Vietnam. Laws were enacted to set up Xuân Thủy Wetland National Park, four UNESCO Biosphere Reserves, and Hạ Long Bay and Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Parks; the last two are also designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{clarify the}} post-glacial {{biogeography}} of the Annamite and eastern Chinese ungulate faunas, and determine whether current understanding of Asian mammalian biogeography is biased by pseudo-extinctions and pseudo-endemism {{associated with a}} historical extinction filter. Location: Modern-day specimens of <b>giant</b> <b>muntjac</b> (Muntiacus vuquangensis) from the Annamite Mountains of Laos and Vietnam were compared with zooarchaeological specimens of extinct <b>giant</b> <b>muntjac</b> (M. gigas) from eastern China, and with a reference sample of northern red muntjac (M. vaginalis) from China, Southeast Asia and South Asia. Methods: We analysed a data set of antler measurements using Multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs), principal component analyses (PCAs) and scaling relationships, to quantify morphometric variation between extinct and living giant muntjacs in relation to variation shown by a different sympatric large-bodied muntjac species. We also attempted ancient biomolecule analysis of Holocene samples from China. Results: Although the combined <b>giant</b> <b>muntjac</b> sample can be differentiated from the reference red muntjac sample {{in all of our}} multivariate morphometric analyses, no significant differences are shown between extinct and living giant muntjacs using any analyses, matching the pattern seen when comparing conspecific red muntjac samples from across the same geographical region. Main conclusions: We find no support for recognizing extinct and living giant muntjacs as distinct taxa, and post-glacial populations from China and the Annamites should probably all be referred to M. gigas. The likely conspecificity of giant muntjacs across Eastern and Southeast Asia demonstrates that current-day Asian mammalian biogeography has been shaped by an extinction filter and challenges the idea that the Annamite region represents a cradle of evolution; instead, it may represent a refuge of diversity for some taxa, preserving remnant pseudo-endemic populations of species that have been extirpated across other parts of their former ranges...|$|E
