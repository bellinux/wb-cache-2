5|$|Brian Lamb, C-SPAN's {{chairman}} and {{former chief executive}} officer, first conceived the concept of C-SPAN in 1975 while working as the Washington, D.C. {{bureau chief of the}} cable industry trade magazine Cablevision. It was a time of rapid {{growth in the number of}} cable television channels available in the United States, and Lamb envisioned a cable-industry financed nonprofit network for televising sessions of the U.S. Congress and other public affairs event and policy discussions. Lamb shared his idea with several cable executives, who helped him launch the network. Among them were Bob Rosencrans who provided $25,000 of initial funding in 1979 and John D. Evans who provided the wiring and access to the <b>headend</b> needed for the distribution of the C-SPAN signal.|$|E
25|$|As of 2008, Virgin Media {{functioned as}} a single company; however, it relied on its three {{existing}} infrastructures: the Langley-based NTL, Bromley-based Cable and Wireless and Knowsley-based Telewest platforms. As part of the Next Generation Television network, the infrastructure was consolidated into a single super <b>headend</b> at Langley in 2010, with Knowsley serving as a backup.|$|E
25|$|On August 1, 1980, HBO {{launched}} Cinemax, {{a companion}} movie-based premium channel created as HBO's answer to fellow movie-oriented pay service The Movie Channel (which operated as a standalone {{service at the}} time). Unlike HBO, Cinemax maintained a 24-hour schedule from its launch. The channel succeeded early on partly due to its reliance on movie classics from the 1950s to the 1970s – with some more recent films mixed in – that would be presented uncut and without commercial interruption, {{at a time when}} cable subscribers only received about three dozen channels due to limited <b>headend</b> channel capacity. In most cases, cable operators sold Cinemax and HBO as a single package, usually offered at a discount for customers that chose to subscribe to both channels.|$|E

25|$|The WeatherStar systems also utilize a Lower Display Line (LDL) {{that appears}} {{at the bottom of}} the screen during all {{programming}} (until November 2013, it had been limited to only local forecasts and national programming, while being removed from the screen during commercial breaks), providing current conditions for a specific location and two or three towns within 15 miles, almanac data and forecasts on cable headends using the IntelliStar system, and only current conditions and forecasts on cable headends using STAR models from WeatherStar XL and older. WeatherStar units also allow cable providers to scroll text messages when in use, including the capability to broadcast severe weather advisories and warnings in effect for the jurisdiction in which the WeatherStar system's cable <b>headend</b> is located and its immediate surrounding area.|$|E
25|$|A {{launched}} on February 1, 1984, initially available to 9.3 million cable television {{homes in the}} U.S. and Canada. The network {{is a result of}} the 1984 merger of Hearst/ABC's Alpha Repertory Television Service (ARTS) and (pre–General Electric merger) RCA-owned The Entertainment Channel. When A debuted, the channel took over the satellite transponder timeslot that ARTS occupied from its launch in 1981. Children's television channel Nickelodeon signed off just before 9:00p.m. Eastern Time, and A took over at 9:00p.m. with a three-hour programming block, which was repeated at 9:00p.m. Pacific Time. In January 1985, A moved to its own dedicated transponder and began delivering its programming 24 hours a day, while Nickelodeon replaced the vacated A programming with a classic television block, Nick at Nite, on July 1 of that year. However, some cable providers continued to carry Nickelodeon and A on the same channel and would usually switch over to A at 8:00p.m. Eastern. It was not until the early 1990s, when providers began installing advanced <b>headend</b> equipment that allowed for expanded channel capacity, that these companies allocated separate channels for both networks.|$|E
25|$|As an NBC affiliate, WCKT/WSVN aired a local {{newscast}} {{in place}} of programs that NBC had aired at noon on weekdays. It also occasionally preempted network shows that aired during the 10 or 11 a.m. timeslot (but ran {{at least one of}} these hours) and preempted an occasional primetime program. While NBC was traditionally far less tolerant of program preemptions than the other major broadcast networks, it did not mind this at first provided that the network was able to get Miami area independent stations to air whatever programs that WSVN chose not to air. In addition, NBC programs that were not broadcast by WSVN were cleared by WPTV, whose signal provides city-grade coverage of Fort Lauderdale and was available on nearly every cable provider in the area. However, in the early 1980s, WPTV was removed from some Miami area cable systems to make room for new channels due to limited <b>headend</b> channel capacity. Largely due to those preemptions, WCKT/WSVN was one of NBC's weaker affiliates. Though NBC continued to arrange for independent stations to air network programs that were not shown on WSVN, the network grew increasingly annoyed at having to resort to such an arrangement in what had grown into a major market. NBC eventually decided that it needed to acquire its own station in the growing South Florida market.|$|E

5000|$|On July 26, 2012, Time Warner Cable (which was {{purchased}} by Charter in 2016) dropped the KPTM HD signal from all of their cable <b>headends</b> within the Lincoln market, in favor of carrying only the KFXL HD signal.|$|R
25|$|CBS did {{not believe}} that KKR would sell WTVJ to another network, so it {{returned}} with a very low offer. KKR turned CBS's offer down almost out of hand and then approached the other networks. ABC was not interested, since it was more than satisfied with its longtime affiliate, WPLG. However, NBC was very interested because its longtime affiliate, WSVN, heavily preempted the network's daytime lineup—including programs that the network aired in the noon timeslot in favor of running a local newscast, as well as an occasional prime time show. NBC was far less tolerant of preemptions than CBS and ABC at the time, and was particularly annoyed at losing valuable advertising in such a fast-growing market. This had not been a problem at first since most of the programs that were preempted by WSVN aired on West Palm Beach-based WPTV, which provided at least grade B signal coverage to nearly the entire Miami-Fort Lauderdale market, and had been available on cable in the area for decades. In the few cases where WPTV and WSVN both turned down an NBC program, the network usually arranged for other stations in the area to carry its programming. However, by 1985, WPTV had been dropped from most Miami cable systems to make way for new cable channels (partly due to limited <b>headend</b> channel capacity), resulting in some NBC programs that were preempted by WSVN being unavailable to some viewers. NBC realized that purchasing its own station with less restrictive ownership laws would guarantee that all of its shows would make it to air. Hence, it made an offer almost as high as Telepictures did a few months before, and in 1987, KKR agreed to sell WTVJ to NBC for $270 million.|$|E
500|$|Programming and {{transmission}} of the Sega Channel's monthly services started with a production team at Sega, which would put together content every month and load it onto a CD-ROM. [...] It was then sent to a satellite station, located in Denver, Colorado. [...] From the station, the signal was transmitted via a Galaxy 7 satellite, which uploaded at 1.435 GHz and downloaded at 1.1GHz, to the local cable providers. [...] In Canada and across South America and Europe, however, the satellite transmission stage was bypassed altogether in favor of direct uploads of the Sega Channel CD-ROM via a cable television <b>headend.</b> [...] In order for the signal to function properly, {{it had to be}} clear of noise in order to prevent download interruptions. [...] To ensure no issues, cable providers had to [...] "clean" [...] their broadcast signal.|$|E

2500|$|On 11 September 2009, Cisco Systems {{announced}} {{a deal to}} support Virgin Media's Internet Protocol TV distribution platform and upgrade its legacy digital TV infrastructure. Virgin Media deployed Cisco Digital Video <b>Headend</b> technology {{in all of its}} regional and central headends, across its national fibre optic network. The TV platform will be capable of delivering advanced services to more than 12.6million UK homes. The infrastructure helped Virgin Media to reduce operating expenses, support the rollout of new conditional-access security services, and accelerate the introduction of new standard and high-definition services. A Virgin Media spokesman later clarified that the plan [...] "isn't quite announcing the 'launch of IPTV services'. The agreement with Cisco is to help enhance our existing TV platform, which broadcasts content over DVB-C and then our VoD service runs on IP." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{some large}} {{nationwide}} cable systems, {{a sort of}} median point between a large super <b>headend</b> and local hub exists and {{is known as a}} market center <b>headend</b> or region <b>headend.</b> Typically a market center <b>headend</b> receives its national video content from the super <b>headend,</b> then forwards that alongside local ad splicing and local channels to local hubs. Market center headends are regularly manned while hubs are not. (outside of normal maintenance and servicing) A main benefit of a market center <b>headend</b> is it can give more attention to local service and details than a nationwide super <b>headend</b> could. For example, a market center <b>headend</b> allows for engineers to pull local video feeds such as public access channels and local channels for viewing and analyzation of video quality defects when such an issue may not be immediately noticed locally. Another benefit is the quick action of channel blackouts in certain areas during times of carriage contract disputes with broadcasters. Market center headends can service hubs in a large city, an entire state or even multiple states.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} provide high speed data services, a cable company will connect its <b>headend</b> to the Internet via very high {{capacity}} data links to a network service provider. On the subscriber side of the <b>headend,</b> the CMTS enables the communication with subscribers' cable modems. Different CMTSs are capable of serving different cable modem population sizes—ranging from 4,000 cable modems to 150,000 or more, depending in part on traffic. A given <b>headend</b> may have between 1-12 CMTSs to service the cable modem population served by that <b>headend</b> or HFC hub.|$|E

50|$|<b>Headends</b> {{incorporated}} a video server which allowed for localized content mixes - local demographics {{could be taken}} into account for selecting the list of videos available for request or frequently requested genres/bands could be queued automatically. The video server had up to a 64GB HDD and the video programs were compressed in the MPEG2 format. In 2000, The Box had approximately 1,800 music videos in its inventory, 150 to 300 of which were queued across the network, at any given time. Subscribers could call the Interactive Voice Response at The Box's central office to request videos over the phone, which was typical, but could also request over the internet or via set-top box. The central office would then send the data to the individual <b>headends</b> regarding what was ordered.|$|R
5000|$|The Weather Star Jr. was {{a budget}} model {{manufactured}} by Wegener Communications for cable <b>headends</b> in smaller communities. Released in 1994 following field testing on eight cable systems in various smaller markets, {{the system was}} based on Wegener's Series 2450 graphics display platform, and cost US$500 per unit. It featured the same products used by the Star III, but utilized the typeface used by the 4000. The Weather Channel was able to upgrade Weather Star Jr. units to meet the FCC's 2002 deadline to require broadcasts of [...] "scrolled" [...] or [...] "crawled" [...] emergency information {{to be accompanied by}} an aural tone for accessibility reasons. When the change in FCC regulations forced the retirement of the Star III, <b>headends</b> using that unit upgraded to the Weather Star Jr. or more advanced units.|$|R
50|$|At a {{traditional}} cable television <b>headend,</b> multitudes of satellite dishes and antennas {{are used to}} grab cable stations from dozens of communication satellites. In contrast, HITS combines cable stations into multiplex signals on just a few satellites; cable television companies can then pull in hundreds of channels at the local <b>headend</b> with relatively little equipment; the HITS feed effectively replaces the more complex traditional <b>headend</b> operations.|$|E
50|$|Some cable TV systems {{receive the}} local {{television}} stations' programming by dedicated coaxial, microwave link or fiber-optic line, installed between the local {{station and the}} <b>headend.</b> A device called a modulator at the local station's facilities feed their programming over this line to the cable TV <b>headend,</b> which in turn receives it with another device called a demodulator. It is then distributed through the cable TV <b>headend</b> to subscribers. This is usually more reliable than receiving the local stations' broadcasts over the air with an antenna. However, off-air reception {{is used as a}} backup by the <b>headend</b> in case of failure. In some cases systems receive local channels by satellite.|$|E
5000|$|The initial trial {{consisted}} of a Prodigy server in the El Cajon <b>headend,</b> connected via the Microchannel-based cable modem to an Olsen Frequency Translator.
