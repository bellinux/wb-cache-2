40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a formal mathematical framework for performance analysis (in terms of success of given tasks) of complex systems, ATLAS. This method interestingly combines temporal aspects (for {{the description of}} the complex system) and probabilities (to represent performance). The system’s task to be evaluated is described using a temporal language, the ATLAS language: the architecture of the task is decomposed into elementary functionalities and temporal operators specify their arrangement. Starting with the success probabilities of the elementary functionalities, it is then possible to compute the overall success probability of the task using mathematical formulae which are proven in this paper. The method is illustrated with a <b>deorbitation</b> task for a retired satellite called ENVISAT...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{accurate}} {{prediction of}} the impact region of a reentering space object {{is a very complex}} problem. A typical reentry scenario involves three major steps. First, the object leaves its original orbit and starts falling back on Earth. This <b>deorbitation</b> step can take years {{in the case of a}} natural reentry or minutes in the case of a controlled <b>deorbitation.</b> The fragmentation step is likely to occur as the object enters more dense layers of the atmosphere, typically at an altitude of 100 kilometers. After fragmentation, parts of the object keep falling while being ablated by the atmosphere before hitting the ground or being entirely burnt by the atmosphere. The objective of this work is to accurately predict the impact region of the surviving fragments of an object. Due to the complexity of the physics involved during reentry, the scarcity of experiments and the unpredictability of events such as fragmentation, any model trying to predict a reentry features a limited reliability due to simplified assumptions and scarcity of data. In this work, we aim to alleviate this issue by coupling an original uncertainty quantification method with a space object reentry software developed by Airbus Safran Launchers in order to estimate the reliability of the numerical predictions. Although Uncertainty Quantification methods have been investigated for reentry problems but they could only include a limited amount of uncertain parameters due to the computational cost of classical uncertainty quantification methods in high dimension. In this work we propose a method that mitigates the curse of dimensionality and allows incorporating more uncertainties to the analysis. It exploits the fact that the solver making the predictions is a system of solvers. A set of interdependent solvers, where the output of an upstream solver is directly the input of a downstream solver), each of them solving a specific aspect of the physical problem. We first build a set of approximating functions of each solver based on global criteria and then they are assembled together in order to propagate the uncertainties through the system in an efficient way. Our mathematical framework allows the identification of specific solver, that affect the accuracy of the whole system. This feature allows to build adaptively an approximation of the global system and significantly reduce the computational cost. This method is then applied to the reentry problem under study...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a study to}} {{determine}} the best strategic choice to deorbit satellites incase of system failures is conducted. An orbital mechanic analysis of the deorbitationis done and a matlab code based on Lagrange’s interplanetary equations is developed. The effects of the atmospheric drag and the solar activity are investigated and the fueland delta velocity consumptions are assessed for different <b>deorbitation</b> strategies. Thepaper also investigates the probability to hit or be hit by a piece of debris. A briefoverview of the acquisition and safe hold modes Bdot and Bspin is given. Then thepossibility to deorbit a satellite working in these attitude and orbit control modes fromlow Earth’s orbits is studied. An attitude and orbit simulator is used to analyze theevolution of the attitude during a manoeuvre, in particular the effect of the thrusters’misalignment is investigated. A strategy which combines manoeuvres and aerobrakingis chosen and its implementation on different types of orbits is studied. The paperconcludes that the necessary manoeuvres for a 25 years deorbiting time can be achieveif the spacecraft has a functional acquisition and safe hold mode and an operationalpropulsion system. In the end an alternate mode based on star trackers and reactionwheels is developed to avoid most of the activations of the acquisition and safe holdmode and to eventually perform the end of life disposal of a spacecraft...|$|E
40|$|The “Non-intrusive battery health monitoring”, {{developed}} by Airbus Defence and Space (ADS) {{in cooperation with}} the CIRIMAT-CNRS laboratory and supported by CNES, aims at providing a diagnosis of the battery ageing in flight, called State of Health (SOH), using only the post-treatment of the battery telemetries. The battery current and voltage telemetries are used by a signal processing tool on ground to characterize and to model the battery at low frequencies which allows monitoring the evolution of its degradation with great accuracy. The frequential behaviour estimation is based on inherent disturbances on the current during the nominal functioning of the battery. For instance, on-board thermal control or equipment consumption generates random disturbances on battery current around an average current. The battery voltage response to these current random disturbances enables to model the low frequency impedance of the battery by a signal processing tool. The re-created impedance is then compared with the evolution model of the low frequencies impedance {{as a function of the}} battery ageing to estimate accurately battery degradation. Hence, this method could be applied to satellites which are already in orbit and whose battery telemetries acquisition system fulfils the constraints determined in the study. This innovative method is an improvement of present state-of-the-art and is important to have a more accurate in-flight knowledge of battery ageing which is crucial for mission and operation planning and also for possible satellite mission extension or <b>deorbitation.</b> This method is patented by Airbus Defence and Space and CNES...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} planning successive Space Debris Collecting missions {{so that they can}} be achieved at minimal cost by a generic vehicle. The problem mixes combinatorial optimization to select and order the debris among a list of candidates, and continuous optimization to fix the rendezvous dates and to define the minimum fuel orbital maneuvers. The solution method proposed consists in three stages. Firstly the orbital transfer problem is simplified by considering a generic transfer strategy suited either to a high thrust or a low thrust vehicle. A response surface modelling is built by solving the reduced problem for all pairs of debris and for discretized dates, and storing the results in cost matrices. Secondly a simulated annealing algorithm is applied to find the optimal mission planning. The cost function is assessed by interpolation on the response surface based on the cost matrices. This allows the convergence of the simulated algorithm in a limited computation time, yielding an optimal mission planning. Thirdly the successive missions are re-optimized in terms of transfer maneuvers and dates without changing the debris order. These continuous control problems yield a refined solution with the performance requirement for designing the future Space Debris Collecting vehicle. The method is applicable for large list of debris and for various assumptions regarding the cleaning program (number of missions, number of debris per mission, total duration, <b>deorbitation</b> scenario, high or low thrust vehicle). It is exemplified on an application case with 3 missions to plan, each mission visiting 5 SSO debris to be selected in a list of 21 candidates. Comment: 42 page...|$|E
