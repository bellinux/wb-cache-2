5|$|Engelbart {{slipped into}} {{relative}} obscurity after 1976. Several of his researchers became alienated {{from him and}} left his organization for Xerox PARC, {{in part due to}} frustration, and in part due to differing views of the future of computing. Engelbart saw the future in collaborative, networked, timeshare (client-server) computers, which younger programmers rejected in favor of the personal computer. The conflict was both technical and ideological: the younger programmers came from an era where centralized power was highly suspect, and personal computing was <b>just</b> <b>barely</b> on the horizon.|$|E
5|$|The Bubonic Plague {{struck again}} in 1839 {{and the city}} stagnated, as it lacked {{political}} and economic stability. In 1840, Egyptian and Ottoman troops battled outside of Gaza, with the Ottomans emerging victorious, effectively ending Egyptian rule over Palestine. The battles brought about more death and destruction, <b>just</b> <b>barely</b> after the city began {{to recover from the}} plague. The Church of Saint Porphyrius was renovated in 1856, and in 1874, French orientalist Charles Clermont-Ganneau visited Gaza, gathering and cataloging a sizable collection of Byzantine inscriptions and describing the city's Great Mosque in detail. Sultan Abdul Hamid II had the wells of Gaza restored in 1893.|$|E

However he finds out the man that is supposed to make the crown has gone out somewhere to the northwest of town and never came back. The hero then heads in that direction and finds a large hole with the crown maker <b>just</b> <b>barely</b> hanging on. The hero attempts to rescue him and succeeds but in the process, slips and falls to the world below. In this mysterious world, the hero finds a nearby town in which the townspeople cannot see him. The hero grabs a tip from one of the townspeople that there's a special well to the north which people went in never came back; thus the hero heads in that direction and returns to his world.|$|E
5|$|Chloe, to her distress, {{does not}} become {{pregnant}} immediately. Chris vainly tries to track down Nola, but meets her by chance some time later at the Tate Modern. He discreetly asks for her number, and they begin an affair. While Chris is spending time with his wife's family, Nola calls to inform him that she is pregnant.

Chris becomes distant from Chloe, who suspects he is having an affair, which he denies. Nola urges Chris to divorce his wife, and he feels trapped and finds himself lying to Chloe as well as to Nola. Nola confronts him on the street outside his office and he <b>just</b> <b>barely</b> escapes public detection.|$|E

In total, Müncheberg claimed five victories in this theatre. His first three victories were over Hurricanes.

His victory on 24 June was over Pilot Officer James Alan Frederick Sowrey of No. 6 Squadron who was killed in the engagement. His opponent on 15 July was either a No. 73 Squadron or No. 229 Squadron RAF pilot.

50|$|Bypassing {{the hamlet}} of Elting Corners to the south, NY 299 becomes a {{residential}} road {{through the town}} of Lloyd, passing north of a mobile home park. Crossing a junction with CR 12 (New Paltz Road), the route bends northward and begins a parallel with CR 15 (South Riverside Road). CR 15 soon merges into NY 299, which continues east past a junction with another piece of CR 15 (North Riverside Road).

40|$|In {{this talk}} I want {{to examine the}} {{organization}} of work in two recuperated enterprises in Argentina. The latter refers {{to a group of}} enterprises that have been appropriated by their workers and are run as self-managed cooperatives. There are about 200 of them, employing around 10, 000. Some of these enterprises are doing very well and some are <b>just</b> generating <b>barely</b> the necessary to cover costs. Some have acquired the property of the business, in general through a process of expropriation that operates on a logic parallel to that of eminent domain, and most operate on a legal limbo where workers have the de facto control of the place but not the de jure ownership. ...|$|R

5|$|Another area {{of concern}} is California, where {{recovery}} began to fluctuate or decline in the late 1990s. Unusually high mortality rates amongst adult and subadult otters, particularly females, have been reported. In 2017 the US Geological Survey found a 3% drop in the sea otter population of the California coast. This number still keeps them on track for removal from the endangered species list, although <b>just</b> <b>barely.</b> Necropsies of dead sea otters indicate diseases, particularly Toxoplasma gondii and acanthocephalan parasite infections, are major causes of sea otter mortality in California. The Toxoplasma gondii parasite, which is often fatal to sea otters, is carried by wild and domestic cats and may be transmitted by domestic cat droppings flushed into the ocean via sewage systems. Although disease has clearly contributed {{to the deaths of}} many of California's sea otters, it is not known why the California population is apparently more affected by disease than populations in other areas.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{scored the}} first {{run of the}} game in the third inning on a Babe Ruth solo home run into the right field bleachers. In the {{following}} half inning, the Cardinals came back to take a 3–1 lead over the Yankees. Jim Bottomley lined a one-out single into left field to start the Cardinals' fourth inning rally. Les Bell <b>just</b> <b>barely</b> made it to first base after shortstop Mark Koenig accidentally kicked the ball while trying to field it. With runners at first and second base, Chick Hafey hit a bloop single into left field, which loaded up the bases for catcher Bob O'Farrell. This time, left fielder Bob Meusel made an error by dropping O'Farrell's fly ball, so Bottomley scored to tie the game, and the bases remained loaded. Tommy Thevenow followed with a two-run single to right fielder Ruth. Hoyt struck out the next batter, and Wattie Holm hit into a force play at second base. All three runs in the inning were charged as unearned on Hoyt, due to the two Yankee errors.|$|E

60|$|It was at {{this time}} of {{profound}} repose and fancied security that the death-knell of the Lively Poll was sounded. In the southern seas there is a little creature, named the coral insect (of which we shall have more to say hereafter), which is ever at work building walls and ramparts {{on the bottom of the}} sea. These rise by degrees to the surface,--rise above it--and finally become some of the fairest isles of the Pacific.

The Lively Poll was forging slowly ahead under a puff of air that only bulged her top-sails as she rose and sank on the majestic swell. Presently she rose high, and was then let down on a coral reef with such violence that the jury-mast with the main-topmast and all the connected rigging, went over the side. Another swell lifted her off, and flung her on the ocean's breast a total wreck.|$|R

Although Republican Senator Jim Bunning endorsed Martin and encouraged fellow party leaders to do the same, most Republicans shied from Martin's candidacy because of her erratic campaign style and open support of abortion rights.
