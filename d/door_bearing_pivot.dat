40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the prototypes of new <b>pivot</b> <b>bearings</b> having {{multiple}} degrees of freedom. The idea of the <b>pivot</b> <b>bearing</b> {{is based on a}} constant velocity joint(CVJ). First,two types of the <b>pivot</b> <b>bearings</b> with 2 DOF are designed and produced. Their design and some static specifications are described. Then,applying the <b>pivot</b> <b>bearing</b> with 2 DOF,three types of the <b>pivot</b> <b>bearings</b> with 3 DOF are prototyped. A full complement ball bearing mechanism is used in order to make smooth motion and downsizing is also aimed. Furthermore,process accuracy of the elements is examined...|$|R

5000|$|The {{engine was}} {{lubricated}} by an [...] "oiler", essentially a tank mounted {{under the seat}} which had several adjustable drip feeds with separate lines to the engine bearings and other areas. All components of the transmission were exposed, so several <b>bearings</b> and <b>pivots</b> had to be oiled or greased manually from time to time.|$|R
50|$|The 'cannon box' bearing was {{introduced}} by George Stephenson on his locomotive Locomotion of 1825 for the Stockton and Darlington Railway. One of the axles was carried in a 'cannon box' <b>bearing</b> that was <b>pivoted</b> centrally and could tilt from side to side. Unlike Stephenson's earlier locomotives and their steam springs, this new suspension had no springing but was a compensated suspension: as one side was raised, the <b>bearing</b> tube <b>pivoted</b> {{and the other side}} was pushed downwards. Although not giving a stable ride for the locomotive, it did allow the wheels to follow uneven track. Rails of this period were short pieces of cast iron rather than lengths of rolled steel and had frequent, often misaligned, joints.|$|R

50|$|The diner {{was built}} by the Worcester Lunch Car Company as #819, and was {{delivered}} to this site by the company in March 1949. It is a well-preserved example of the company's post-World War II craftsmanship. The diner is ten bays wide and three deep, and sits on a brick foundation. A kitchen wing, built of concrete blocks, connects the diner to the house at 507 Main Street. The entrances to the diner are at either end, with original stainless steel <b>doors</b> <b>bearing</b> sunburst motifs. Inside the diner is a full-length marble counter with center staff access, with 18 counter stools, and wooden booths lining the front wall.|$|R

40|$|LectureSevere axial subsynchronous {{vibrations}} (SSV) can be {{encountered in}} turbomachinery. A major {{concern is the}} potential for danger from the high levels of vibration acting on the rotor. Longer term implications are fretting and fatigue damage of the rotor components and support structures, which include the thrust <b>bearing</b> <b>pivot</b> contact areas. Although axial SSV is a concern in turbomachinery applications, little published literature {{can be found on the}} subject. A series of laboratory tests were therefore designed and performed to investigate the phenomenon in more detail. This paper presents experimental data from a series of <b>pivoted</b> shoe thrust <b>bearing</b> tests investigating the influence of operating conditions and other parameters on axial SSV. Parameters include thrust load, shaft speed, oil flow, inlet temperature, axial clearance, pivot offset, and direct and flooded lubrication. Test results are used to evaluate techniques that have been used when attempting to resolve axial vibration issues. Additional data from thrust shoe load cells and thrust shoe proximity probes provide unique and valuable insight that allowed development of a more robust solution...|$|R

6000|$|In {{a corner}} {{of one of the}} winding courts that lie behind Fleet Street stood a dingy-looking house, the lamp over the <b>door</b> <b>bearing</b> the words, [...] "Billiards and Pool." [...] During the daytime no one would be seen to enter save between the hours of twelve and two, when perhaps a dozen young fellows, after eating a frugal lunch, would resort there to pass their hour out of office in smoking and a game of billiards. Of an evening, however, there were lights in every window, and the click of balls could be heard from the ground floor and that above it. In each of these there were two tables, and the play {{continued}} uninterruptedly from seven until eleven or half-past.|$|R
5000|$|A {{few months}} later, the Royal Princess {{delivered}} her predicted son at her residence in Gangtok.

60|$|After this {{there was}} {{something}} in the mutual look of the two, though their words had been private, which did not tend to remove the anguish of fragile Picotee. Christopher, assured that Ethelberta's embarrassment had been caused by nothing more than the sense of her odd social subsidence, recovered more bliss than he had lost, and regarded calmly the profile of young Ladywell between the two windows of his brougham as it passed the open cottage <b>door,</b> <b>bearing</b> him along unconscious as the dead of the nearness of his beloved one, and of the sad buffoonery that fate, fortune, and the guardian angels had been playing with Ethelberta of late. He recognized the face as that of the young man whom he had encountered when watching Ethelberta's window from Rookington Park.|$|R
50|$|Wittenberg {{is home to}} {{numerous}} historical sites, as well as portraits and other paintings by Lucas Cranach the Elder and Younger. On the doors of All Saints' Church, the Schlosskirche ("castle church", built in 1496-1506) Luther {{is said to have}} nailed his 95 theses in 1517. It was seriously damaged by fire in 1760 during a bombardment by the French during the Seven Years' War, was practically rebuilt, and was later (1885-1892) restored. The wooden doors, burnt in 1760, were replaced in 1858 by bronze <b>doors,</b> <b>bearing</b> the Latin text of the theses. Inside the church are the tombs of Luther and Philipp Melanchthon, and of the electors Frederick the Wise (by Peter Vischer the Younger, 1527) and John the Constant (by Hans Vischer), and portraits of the reformers by Lucas Cranach the Younger.|$|R
