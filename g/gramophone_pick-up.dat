40|$|An {{improved}} {{method of}} recording tremor in mice {{has been developed}} using a <b>gramophone</b> <b>pick-up</b> and a cathode ray oscillograph. Permanent records are made on 35 mm. film from which {{it is possible to}} determine qualitative differences in the tremor caused by various drugs. In addition, the severity of the tremor may be estimated quantitatively by a tremor index. The rate and variations in the rhythm and amplitude and in the tremor index have been determined for Tremorine (1, 4 -dipyrrolidin- 1 '-ylbut- 2 -yne), harmine, harmaline, 3 -amino- 1, 1, 3 -triphenylpropan- 1 -ol and lysergic acid diethylamide. The incidence of side effects has also been noted...|$|E
5000|$|Potassium sodium {{tartrate}} tetrahydrate, {{also known}} as Rochelle salt, is a double salt of tartaric acid first prepared (in about 1675) by an apothecary, Pierre Seignette, of La Rochelle, France. Potassium sodium tartrate and monopotassium phosphate were the first materials discovered to exhibit piezoelectricity. This property led to its extensive use in [...] "crystal" [...] <b>gramophone</b> (phono) <b>pick-ups,</b> microphones and earpieces during the post-World War II consumer electronics boom of the mid-20th Century. Such transducers had an exceptionally high output with typical pick-up cartridge outputs as much as 2 volts or more. Rochelle salt is deliquescent so any transducers based on the material deteriorated if stored in damp conditions.|$|R
