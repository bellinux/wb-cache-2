5|$|From the mid-twentieth century, public {{architecture}} {{became more}} utilitarian, {{as part of}} the impulse to produce a comprehensive welfare state and the influence of modernism. The main thrust of post-war planning was in clearance and rebuilding. The process began in Paisley, where from 1955 the populations of districts were decanted, the buildings demolished and rebuilding began. The result in the first district, George Street/ Canal Street, were low flats built in render and reused rubble around landscaped courtyards, with a 15-storey tower at one end. As the post-war desire for urban regeneration gained momentum it would focus on the tower block, championed in Glasgow by David Gibson, convener of the city housing committee. Projects like the brutalist Red Road Flats (1964–69) originally offered hope of a new beginning and an escape from the overcrowded nineteenth-century tenements of the city, but lacked a sufficient infrastructure and soon deteriorated. They also made extensive use of asbestos as a <b>fire</b> <b>retardant,</b> leading to long term health problems for builders and residents.

5|$|The {{explosion}} of the Stumpf was filmed using an actual New Orleans ferry in {{a portion of the}} Mississippi River sectioned off especially for the event; the occurrence took over four hours to prepare. Under the supervision of pyrotechnics expert John Frazier, the ferry was coated entirely with <b>fire</b> <b>retardant</b> and rigged with fifty gasoline bombs including black dirt and diesel, each one set to detonate within a five-second range. People and cars were added in later as elements of computer-generated graphics. Chris Lebenzon was largely responsible for moving clips from each of the sixteen cameras in place to create the sensation of an extended explosion sequence. The spectacular explosion actually caused no significant structural damage to the ferry; after a bout of sandblasting and repainting, the ferry was very similar to its previous state. The ferry was returned into service four days after the production of the film's scene concluded. During filming of the underwater car scenes, actual cars were dropped into the water; computer-generated effects were later added, simulating the entities' explosions. Compositing was done on the Autodesk Inferno special effects program.|$|E

To modify the flammability of wood-plastic composites(WPC), various <b>fire</b> <b>retardants,</b> such as ammonium polysphosphate (APP), melamine polyphosphate (MPP) and aluminum hydroxide were added to WPCs. Burning tests based on UL 94 and cone calorimetry were conducted to evaluate a fire performance of WPCs with <b>fire</b> <b>retardants.</b> The addition of <b>fire</b> <b>retardants</b> could lead to self-extinguishing materials when 10 wt% of APP was used.

Wood flour accelerates the burning behavior of PP, but it can reduce the use of APP to achieve self-extinguishing materials. Synergy effects between wood flour and APP was confirmed. Wood flour facilitates the forming of foamed char layer by APP during the combustion. This protective char surface can reduce the heat and oxygen diffusion toward the WPCs. The effect of <b>fire</b> <b>retardants</b> of mechanical properties of WPCs was also investigated.
