5|$|From January 12, 1880 to May 12, 1880, Carpenter {{directed}} scouting missions {{into the}} isolated Chinati Mountains bordering the United States with Mexico. The surrounding {{area on the}} American side was the high desert of far West Texas. This is where Victorio and other Apaches <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>making</b> raids. These scouts helped provide the first reliable maps drawn {{in the areas of}} operation. Finding waterholes and mapping the area was a critical step in Victorio campaign.|$|E
5|$|Todd McFarlane from Calgary <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>making</b> waves {{since the}} late 1980s {{illustrating}} comics for DC and Marvel Comics, becoming a fan favourite writer/artist for Spider-Man. He eventually left to co-found the creator-owned comics publishing collective Image Comics, where he debuted the enormously successful Spawn. Spawn holds the record for most copies sold of an independent comic, and was the most financially successful comics franchise of the decade.|$|E

5|$|After {{failing to}} regain the WWF Tag Team Championship, Money Inc. began a feud with Razor Ramon. DiBiase <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>making</b> fun of Ramon over his upset loss to the 1-2-3 Kid, and even offered Ramon a job as his servant. Ramon was furious with DiBiase and turned face during their feud. Soon after, Ramon distracted DiBiase in a match against the 1-2-3 Kid, causing the Million Dollar Man an {{embarrassing}} loss of his own. At SummerSlam 1993, Razor Ramon defeated Ted DiBiase in what would be DiBiase's last WWF match. Later in the event, I.R.S. defeated the 1-2-3 Kid. DiBiase went on {{a leave of absence}} for several months, and Schyster returned to singles competition, feuding with Ramon.|$|E
5|$|François Coli, age 45, a World War I {{veteran and}} {{recipient}} of the French Legion of Honor, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>making</b> record-breaking flights across and around the Mediterranean Sea, and had been planning a transatlantic flight since 1923. His original plans were to fly with his wartime comrade Paul Tarascon, a flying ace with 12 victories from the war. They {{became interested in the}} Orteig Prize in 1925, but in late 1926 an accident destroyed their Potez 25 biplane. Tarascon was badly burned, and relinquished his place as pilot to 35-year-old Charles Nungesser, a highly experienced flying ace with over 40 victories, third highest among the French.|$|E
5|$|From 1971 Texas Instruments <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>making</b> {{available}} {{the building}} block {{for a simple}} calculator on a single chip and the TMS0803 chipset appeared {{in a number of}} Sinclair calculators.

5|$|Rolle {{left the}} LSU program on May 23. LSU coach John Brady claimed {{this was due}} to {{concerns}} over Rolle's development. Darrel Sears, his former high school coach, said Rolle had been unhappy with LSU since December 2006, and that Brady <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>making</b> snide comments about Rolle for a while. After Rolle left LSU, he was courted by Division I schools Wyoming, Marshall, Oral Roberts, Delaware, Louisiana Tech, and South Florida. Although initially interested in South Florida due to its proximity to his Bahamas home, Rolle chose to transfer to Louisiana Tech to play under Kerry Rupp.|$|E
5|$|This {{surge in}} {{interest}} for Emerson's knives soon became overwhelming. Although he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>making</b> knives full-time since 1994, Emerson was still manufacturing these knives {{in his home}} garage workshop three years later. As Emerson watched his customers' wait time expand from two years to seven, {{he realized that the}} demand for his handmade blades was far outpacing his ability to produce them. The first method to bridge this gap between supply and demand would be through factory collaborations with established cutlery companies.|$|E
5|$|Paper {{was one of}} the {{greatest}} discoveries of ancient China. Beginning in the 3rd century BCE paper was made in all sizes with various materials. Silk was no exception, and silk workers <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>making</b> paper since the 2nd century BCE. Silk, bamboo, linen, wheat and rice straw were all used differently, and paper made with silk became the first type of luxury paper. Researchers have found an early example of writing done on silk paper in the tomb of a Marchioness who died around 168, in Mawangdui, Changsha, Hunan. The material was certainly more expensive, but also more practical than bamboo slips. Treatises on many subjects, including meteorology, medicine, astrology, divinity, and even maps written on silk have been discovered.|$|E

5|$|The {{department}} store Dickins and Jones was established at No.54 Oxford Street as Dickins and Smith {{before moving to}} Nos.232–234 Regent Street in 1835. It was renamed to Dickins and Jones in the 1890s after John Pritchard Jones became a business partner, and {{by the turn of}} the 20th century employed over 200 people. It became part of the Harrods group in 1914, and expanded to cover Nos.224–244 in 1922, in a new building designed by Sir Henry Tanner. In 1959, House of Fraser took over the store by buying the Harrods group. In 2005, House of Fraser announced that the store would close the following year, after it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>making</b> a loss for several years and not kept up with more fashion-conscious {{department store}}s elsewhere. The building has been redeveloped with small shop units on the lower floors and flats and offices above.|$|E
5|$|Though he {{was gaining}} adherents, Aberhart insisted that his aim {{was not to}} enter politics, but to persuade {{existing}} parties to adopt social credit in their platforms. To this end, he appeared at the UFA convention of 15 January 1935. The night before, he organised a reception for delegates. Besides Aberhart, it featured actors portraying two characters of whom Aberhart <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>making</b> considerable use in presentations around the province: the Man from Mars, who expressed bewilderment that poverty could exist {{in the midst of}} plenty and that governments were doing nothing about it, and Kant B. Dunn, who brought up straw man arguments against social credit for Aberhart to dismantle. Another of Aberhart's characters, the bumbling socialist C. C. Heifer, did not make an appearance; Aberhart biographers David Elliott and Iris Miller suggest that this was to avoid alienating the many UFA members who supported socialism.|$|E
5|$|Caligari {{was filmed}} in the Lixie-Atelier film studio (formerly owned by Continental-Kunstfilm) at 9 Franz Joseph-Strasse (now Max Liebermannstraße), Weißensee, a {{north-eastern}} suburb of Berlin. Decla <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>making</b> films at the Lixie studio since October 1919, having previously released three titles, Die Pest in Florenz (1919) {{and the two}} parts of Fritz Lang's The Spiders (Die Spinnen). The relatively small size of the studio (built some five years earlier in 1914) meant most of the sets used in the film do not exceed six meters in width and depth. Certain elements from the original script had to be cut from the film due to the limited space, including a procession of gypsies, a handcart pushed by Dr. Caligari, Jane's carriage, and a chase scene involving horse-cabs. Likewise, the script called for a fairground scene with roundabouts, barrel organs, sideshow barkers, performers and menageries, none {{of which could be}} achieved in the restrictive space. Instead, the scenes use a painting of the Holstenwall town as a background; throngs of people walk around two spinning merry-go-round props, which creates the impression of a carnival. The script also made references to modern elements like telephones, telegrams and electric light, but they were eliminated during the filming, leaving the final film's setting with no indication of a specific time period.|$|E

5|$|During {{the next}} few weeks, the pair began a losing streak, mainly caused by Hurricane's {{on-screen}} injuries. During the October 17 episode of Raw, The Hurricane was assaulted by Kurt Angle {{at the request of}} Vince McMahon. After the beating, footage was shown of The Hurricane ripping off his mask and striking Rosey because he did not help him fend off Angle. The next week, The Hurricane no-showed a World Tag Team Title match, leaving Rosey to face the champions alone. During the match, The Hurricane (out of costume) appeared {{at the top of the}} entrance ramp, reverting to his real name, Gregory Helms, and watched as Rosey was double teamed and defeated. After the match, Helms announced that he was fed up with being funny for the crowd, and that he was sick of carrying Rosey as a tag team partner. This turned him into a heel in the process. On the November 7 episode of Raw, Helms and Rosey faced off in a singles match, which Helms won. Subsequently, Helms wrestled mostly on Raws sister show, Heat. On the January 2, 2006 episode of Raw Helms confronted Jerry Lawler over jokes that Lawler <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>making</b> at Helms' expense, and Lawler said that when Helms was The Hurricane, he was entertaining and called Helms a joke. Helms responded by slapping Lawler, who hit Helms back. This confrontation led to Lawler defeating Helms in a match at New Year's Revolution.|$|E
5|$|On 19 June, {{the first}} part of the long-awaited French {{contingent}} (in total some 6,000 soldiers and 31 ships), under the command of François, Duke of Beaufort, arrived at Candia. The second part, comprising the galley fleet, would arrive on 3 July. The Ottomans <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>making</b> steady progress over the past years, having reached the outer bastions of the fortress; the defenders were in dire straits, while most of the city of Candia lay ruined. The French staged their first sally on 25 June. Caught by surprise, the Ottomans were quickly routed, but the French became disorganized among the siege trenches, and an Ottoman counter-attack drove them back. The attack thus ended in disaster, costing the French some 800 dead, including the Duke of Beaufort himself, who was hit by a bullet and left on the field. The arrival of the second half of the French expeditionary force revived the defenders' morale, and a combined attack was agreed upon, involving bombardment of the Ottoman siege lines by the powerful allied fleet. The attack was launched on 25 July, in an impressive display of firepower: up to 15,000 cannonballs were said to have been fired by the fleet alone. The Ottomans however were well-protected by their deep earthworks, and suffered comparatively little damage, while things went awry for the Christian fleet, as an accident caused the explosion of the French ship Thérèse, which in turn caused significant casualties among the surrounding French and Venetian ships.|$|E
5|$|As {{parliament}} {{is usually}} in recess {{during the summer}} months, Fingleton's political journalism did not often interfere with his cricket radio commentary for the ABC or his cricket writing, except during tours of England in the Australian winter. Fingleton mainly freelanced for overseas newspapers as he regarded Australian editors as being difficult to work with, and because the pay was lower. In 1946–47, England toured Australia for the first full Test series since the war. Fingleton criticised Bradman for not walking after hitting a disputed catch to Jack Ikin. Fingleton and most in the press box thought that the catch was clean but the umpire ruled in favour of Bradman. At the time Bradman <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>making</b> a comeback from ill health and had been struggling, and {{it was thought that}} he would retire if he could not discover his old form. After the dispute catch however, Bradman began timing the ball and went on to score 187. Fingleton openly criticised the decision to give Bradman not out in his writing. Later in the series, he decried Bradman's tactics of having his pacemen bowl frequent bouncers at the English batsmen, pointing out that it was hypocritical for the Australian captain to vociferously condemn Jardine's tactics years earlier. As Fingleton {{was one of the few}} who were forthright enough to question the actions of national hero Bradman, many sources within the Australian cricket community chose to confide in him, most notably all-rounder Keith Miller, whose cavalier attitude brought him into conflict with Bradman's ruthless approach to victory. The following season, during the Indian team's tour of Australia, Fingleton began his association with The Hindu.|$|E
