5|$|Colt set up {{libraries}} and educational programs within his armories for his employees which were seminal training grounds for {{several generations of}} toolmakers and other machinists, who had <b>great</b> <b>influence</b> in other manufacturing efforts of the next half century.

5|$|Anarchism as {{a social}} {{movement}} in Cuba held <b>great</b> <b>influence</b> with the working classes during the 19th and early 20th century. The movement was particularly strong following {{the abolition of slavery}} in 1886, until it was repressed first in 1925 by President Gerardo Machado, and finally by Fidel Castro's Marxist–Leninist government following the Cuban Revolution in the late 1950s. Cuban anarchism mainly took the form of anarcho-collectivism based on the works of Mikhail Bakunin and, later, anarcho-syndicalism. The Latin American labor and by extension the Cuban labor movement itself was at first more influenced by anarchism than Marxism.|$|E

5|$|As a human institution, Byzantium {{under the}} Komnenoi {{played a key}} role in the history of the Crusades in the Holy Land, while also exerting {{enormous}} cultural and political influence in Europe, the Near East, and the lands around the Mediterranean Sea. The Komnenian emperors, particularly John and Manuel, exerted <b>great</b> <b>influence</b> over the Crusader states of Outremer, whilst Alexios I {{played a key role}} in the course of the First Crusade, which he helped bring about.|$|E
5|$|During his {{operations}} in Isauria, Illus took Zeno's brother, Longinus, prisoner and {{kept him in}} an Isaurian fortress. Because {{he thought he would}} have <b>great</b> <b>influence</b> over a restored Zeno, he changed sides and marched with Zeno towards Constantinople in the summer of 476. When Basiliscus received news of this danger, he hastened to recall his ecclesiastical edicts and to conciliate the Patriarch and the people, but it was too late.|$|E
5|$|For Reyner Banham, Tange was a prime {{exemplar of}} the use of Brutalist architecture. His use of Béton brut {{concrete}} finishes in a raw and undecorated way combined with his civic projects such as the redevelopment of Tokyo Bay made him a <b>great</b> <b>influence</b> on British architects during the 1960s. Brutalist architecture has been criticised for being soulless and for promoting the exclusive use of a material that is poor at withstanding long exposures to natural weather.|$|E

5|$|French cuisine was codified in the 20th {{century by}} Auguste Escoffier {{to become the}} modern haute cuisine; Escoffier, however, left out much of the local culinary {{character}} {{to be found in}} the regions of France and was considered difficult to execute by home cooks. Gastro-tourism and the Guide Michelin helped to acquaint people with the rich bourgeois and peasant cuisine of the French countryside starting in the 20th century. Gascon cuisine has also had <b>great</b> <b>influence</b> over the cuisine in the southwest of France. Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated in variations across the country.|$|E
5|$|The Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox Churches {{and their}} {{calendars}} had <b>great</b> <b>influence</b> on eating habits; consumption of meat was forbidden {{for a full}} third {{of the year for}} most Christians. All animal products, including eggs and dairy products (but not fish), were generally prohibited during Lent and fast. Additionally, it was customary for all citizens to fast prior to taking the Eucharist. These fasts were occasionally for a full day and required total abstinence.|$|E
5|$|The attempt had <b>great</b> <b>influence</b> on Reagan's popularity; polls {{indicated}} {{his approval}} rating to be around 73%. Reagan believed that God had spared his life {{so that he might}} go on to fulfill a greater purpose and, although not a Catholic, meetings with Mother Teresa, Cardinal Terence Cooke, and fellow shooting survivor Pope John Paul II reinforced his belief. Agent Parr came to believe that God had directed his life to save Reagan, and became a pastor.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I examine the {{incentives}} of regions to unite, to separate {{and to provide}} public goods. Separation allows for <b>greater</b> <b>influence</b> over the nature of political decision making while unification allows regions to exploit economies of scale {{in the provision of}} public goods. When public good provision is relatively inexpensive, separation occurs since individuals want to assert <b>greater</b> <b>influence,</b> while for intermediate costs of public good provision, separation {{can be explained by the}} desires for <b>greater</b> <b>influence</b> as well as for more public goods. Compared with the social optimum, there are excessive incentives for public good provision as well as excessive incentives for separation. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{duties of}} the {{principal}} secretary were not defined formally, but as he handled all royal correspondence and determined the agenda of council meetings, he could wield <b>great</b> <b>influence</b> in all matters of policy and in every field of government, both foreign and domestic. During his term of office, Walsingham supported the use of England's maritime power to open new trade routes and explore the New World, and {{was at the heart}} of international affairs. He was involved directly with English policy towards Spain, the Netherlands, Scotland, Ireland and France, and embarked on several diplomatic missions to neighbouring European states.|$|E
5|$|The {{reign of}} Constantine {{established}} {{a precedent for}} {{the position of the}} emperor as having <b>great</b> <b>influence</b> and ultimate regulatory authority within the religious discussions involving the early Christian councils of that time, e.g., most notably the dispute over Arianism. Constantine himself disliked the risks to societal stability that religious disputes and controversies brought with them, preferring where possible to establish an orthodoxy. His influence over the early Church councils was to enforce doctrine, root out heresy, and uphold ecclesiastical unity; what proper worship and doctrines and dogma consisted of was for the Church to determine, {{in the hands of the}} participating bishops.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationships}} between Julia Maesa, Julia Soaemias, and Elagabalus were strong at first. His {{mother and grandmother}} became the first women to be allowed into the Senate, and both received senatorial titles: Soaemias the established title of Clarissima, and Maesa the more unorthodox Mater Castrorum et Senatus ("Mother of the army camp and of the Senate"). They held the title of Augusta as well, suggesting {{that they may have}} been the power behind the throne. Indeed, they exercised <b>great</b> <b>influence</b> over the young emperor throughout his reign, and can be found on many coins and inscriptions—a rare honor for Roman women.|$|E

5|$|William {{excluded}} George {{from active}} military service, and neither George nor Anne wielded any <b>great</b> <b>influence</b> {{until after the}} deaths of Mary and then William, at which point Anne became queen. During his wife's reign, George occasionally used his influence {{in support of his}} wife, even when privately disagreeing with her views. He had an easy-going manner and little interest in politics; his appointment as Lord High Admiral in 1702 was largely honorary.|$|E
5|$|A new {{aristocracy}} {{known as}} the Kazoku was established. It merged the ancient court nobility of the Heian period, the Kuge, and the former Daimyo, feudal lords subordinate to the Shogun. It also established the Imperial Diet, consisting of the House of Representatives and the House of Peers. Members of the House of Peers were {{made up of the}} Imperial Family, the Kazoku, and those nominated by the Emperor, while members of the House of Representatives were elected by direct male suffrage. Despite clear distinctions between powers of the executive branch and the Emperor in the Meiji Constitution, ambiguity and contradictions in the Constitution eventually led to a political crisis. It also devalued the notion of civilian control over the military, which meant that the military could develop and exercise a <b>great</b> <b>influence</b> on politics.|$|E
5|$|After Ueshiba left Hokkaidō in 1919, he met and {{was profoundly}} {{influenced}} by Onisaburo Deguchi, the {{spiritual leader of}} the Ōmoto-kyō religion (a neo-Shinto movement) in Ayabe. One of the primary features of Ōmoto-kyō is its emphasis on the attainment of utopia during one's life. This was a <b>great</b> <b>influence</b> on Ueshiba's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to {{those who seek to}} harm others. Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it. In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker.|$|E

5|$|Between October 1992 and March 1993, Sargsyan {{served as}} the Presidential Adviser on Defence Affairs and the Presidential Envoy to Border Regions of Armenia. Subsequently, he was {{appointed}} the State Minister on Defence, Security and Internal Affairs. In these positions, Sargsyan had {{a major role in}} the advance of the Armenian army. With other key commanders, he regulated the operations to the Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh. He was particularly active in unifying the various semi-independent detachments active in the war zone. Political chaos in Azerbaijan and the demoralization of the Azerbaijani army resulted in the Armenian forces taking control over the territories outside of the original Soviet-drawn borders of Nagorno-Karabakh. In 1993, Sargsyan founded and led Yerkrapah, a union of 5,000 war veterans, that had a <b>great</b> <b>influence</b> in Armenia's domestic politics in the post-war years and became the main base for Vazgen Sargsyan to rise in power.|$|E
5|$|Business school rankings are {{important}} to the various business schools because they are an important marketing tool used to recruit top students, and lure recruiters from the top companies. Business schools attempt to achieve higher rankings in order that they may obtain the top students who will over the course of their careers most likely benefit the school by achieving high ranking positions, attaining <b>great</b> <b>influence,</b> and accumulating great wealth. Such students often are able to help other students attain better (higher paying, more respected and more influential) jobs. Students use the rankings to choose their school, and creators of the rankings produce them to aid in this decision.|$|E
5|$|Discontent was brewing in England {{against the}} {{personal}} rule of Henry VI, {{who had been}} declared of age in 1437. The main antagonists were Richard, Duke of York, and Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset. Somerset enjoyed <b>great</b> <b>influence</b> over the king, but after Henry had been incapacitated by mental illness in 1453, York was appointed protector in 1454. The Nevilles were by this time closely associated with York, so the natural option for Northumberland was to side with Somerset and the king. Attempts were made to reconcile Northumberland and Salisbury in the north, but little was accomplished. In December, the king rallied sufficiently to resume control of government, and York's protectorate was terminated. With Somerset back at the centre of power, civil war seemed imminent.|$|E
