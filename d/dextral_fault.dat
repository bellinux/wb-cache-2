50|$|A fault bend, or fault stepover, forms when {{individual}} {{segments of}} the fault overlap and link together. The type of structures which form along the strike-slip fault depend on the sense of slip relative {{to the sense of}} stepping. When a sinistral fault steps to the right or a <b>dextral</b> <b>fault</b> steps to the left, a restraining bend is formed. These are areas of positive relief (topographic uplift), crustal shortening, and exhumation of crystalline basement. As seen in deeply eroded outcrop exposures or from subsurface geophysical surveys, restraining bends commonly define positive flower structures. In plan view we see them form contractional strike-slip duplexs, subparallel reverse or oblique-slip contractional faults that are bounded by two strike-slip segments. Restraining bends are widespread on the Earth's surface, from sub-outcrop-scale examples to large scale mountain ranges. They have been theorized to occur on extraterrestrial bodies, like Jupiter's icy moon Europa and on Venus.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Th e North Anatolian Fault System (NAFS) that {{separates}} the Eurasian plate in the north from the Anatolian microplate in the south is an intracontinental transform plate boundary. Its course makes a northward convex arch-shaped pattern by fl exure in its central part between Ladik {{in the east and}} Kargı in the west. A number of strike-slip basins of dissimilar type and age occur within the NAFS. One of the spatially large basins is the E–W-trending Merzifon-Suluova basin (MS basin), about 55 km long and 22 km wide, located on the southern inner side of the northerly-convex section of the NAFS. Th e MS basin has two infi lls separated from each other by an angular unconformity. Th e older and folded one is exposed along the fault-controlled margins of the basin, and dominantly consists of a Miocene fl uvio-lacustrine sedimentary sequence. Th e younger, nearly horizontal basin infi ll (neotectonic infi ll) consists mainly of Plio– Quaternary conglomerates and sandstone-mudstone alternations of fan-apron deposits, alluvial fan deposits and recent basin fl oor sediments. Th e two basin infi lls have an angular unconformity between them and the deformed pattern of the older infi ll reveals the superimposed nature of the MS basin. Th e MS basin is controlled by a series of strike-slip fault zones along its margins.

40|$|New structural, paleomagnetic, and apatite (U-Th) /He {{results from}} the {{continental}} margin inboard of the Queen Charlotte fault (~ 54 °N) delineate patterns of brittle faulting linked to transform development since ~ 50 Ma. In {{the core of the}} orogen, ~ 250 km from the transform, north striking, dip-slip brittle faults and vertical axis rotation of large crustal domains occurred after ~ 50 Ma and before intrusion of mafic dikes at 20 Ma. By 20 Ma, <b>dextral</b> <b>faulting</b> was active in the core of the orogen, but extension had migrated toward the transform, continuing there until < 9 Ma. Local tilting in the core of the orogen is associated with glacially driven, post- 4 Ma exhumation. Integration with previous results shows that post- 50 Ma <b>dextral</b> and normal <b>faulting</b> affected a region ~ 250 km inboard of the transform and ~ 300 km along strike. Initially widespread, the zone of active extension narrowed and migrated toward the transform ~ 25 Ma after initiation of the transform, while <b>dextral</b> <b>faulting</b> continued throughout the region. Differential amounts of post- 50 Ma extension created oroclines at the southern and northern boundaries of the deformed region. This region approximately corresponds to continental crust that was highly extended just prior to transform initiation. Variation in Neogene crustal tilts weakens interpretations relying on uniform tilting to explain anomalous paleomagnetic inclinations of mid-Cretaceous plutons. Similarities to the Gulf of California suggest that development of a transform in continental crust is aided by previous crustal extension and that initially widespread extension narrows and moves toward the transform as the margin develops...|$|R

40|$|The Mina {{deflection}} (MD) is structural step-over that transfers fault {{slip from}} the southern Walker Lane (WL) to the central WL {{by a combination of}} sinistral, <b>dextral,</b> and normal <b>faults.</b> Recent geologic studies in the southwestern MD provide insight into the kinematics of fault-slip transfer from the WL to the MD. The southwestern MD is a faulted volcanic field underlain by Miocene latite (~ 11. 17 Ma), Pliocene hornblende dacite, tuffaceous sandstone, basalt flows (~ 3. 13 to 3. 43 Ma), andesite, and cinder cones, and Quaternary sedimentary deposits. Faults, which cut all but the Quaternary units, define three zones: NW-striking <b>dextral</b> <b>faults</b> in the south, NE-striking sinistral faults in the north, and the EW-striking sinistral Coaldale fault in the center. The NW-dextral and EW-sinistral Coaldale faults are mutually cross-cutting, illustrating the complex fault geometry that transfers fault slip from the <b>dextral</b> <b>faults</b> of the WL to the sinistral faults of the MD. Offset markers identified along the strike-slip faults include basalt ridge lines, faults, and unit contacts and yield a minimum dextral offset of 0. 8 - 1. 3 km and sinistral offset of 0. 6 km. Combining magnitude of offset with age of offset units yields minimum dextral and sinistral slip rates of 0. 2 - 0. 4 mm/yr and 0. 2 mm/yr, respectively. Published fault kinematic models predict Pliocene dextral slip rates of ~ 0. 4 - 0. 8 mm/yr, sinistral slip rates of ~ 0. 1 - 0. 2 mm/yr, and sinistral slip rates of ≥ 0. 4 mm/yr along the Coaldale faults in the River Spring area.

Magma rose and extruded along NE-SW areas of localized extension created by the <b>dextral</b> <b>faults.</b> These extensional areas were uncoupled with regard to those, ~E-W trending, inferred to have focused the rise of melts from the subducting slab in the mantle.

The deformation pattern mostly consisted of N-S thrust faults and subordinate ~E-W extensional structures, produced by ~E-W compression, resulting from orthogonal convergence due to the variation in the absolute motion of the Pacific Plate. The ~E-W extensional structures are the shallowest expression of ~E-W trending hot mantle fingers, suggesting mantle-crust coupling for the rise of magma. Such a coupling ensures: (a) higher extrusion and (b) mixing between a deeper mafic and a shallower felsic magma, generating the andesites.

In the study area, where both the Sesia-Lanzo Zone (Austroalpine Domain) and the Lanzo Ultramafic Complex (Piemonte Zone) crop out, this integrated approach allowed distinguishing an E-W-striking major <b>dextral</b> transcurrent/transpressive <b>fault</b> system. E-W faults, usually sub-parallel, are arranged at times in en-echelon left stepped geometric pattern and linked by minor NE-SW faults. The transcur-rent activity of these structures, consistent with a bulk NW-SE short-ening direction with a NE-SW extension, occurred under brittle-duc-tile to brittle structural conditions. Rare mesoscale kinematic data also suggest a transtensive/extensional reactivation for these faults under brittle conditions. Dextral transcurrent/transpressive movements along the E-W fault system analysed in this study could be considered roughly coeval with the dextral activity along the N-S striking Col del Lis-Trana Deformation Zone, consistent with a NE-SW to E-W shorten-ing direction, as their transcurrent activity occurred under similar structural conditions. These different shortening directions may be the result of a complex strain partitioning, in time and space, of the bulk deformation induced, since the Oligocene, in the Western Alps by the NW-SE convergence, coupled with the anticlockwise rotation, of the Adria plate with respect to the European plate. In this kind of scenario the E-W <b>dextral</b> <b>faults</b> affecting the Lower Lanzo Valley accommodated the NW-SE directed convergence whereas the N-S <b>dextral</b> <b>faults,</b> like the Col del Lis-Trana Deformation Zone, adsorbed the rotational component between the two colliding plates. The subsequent normal reactivation of the E-W faults may be related to the extensional regime that affected the inner Western Alps since the Early(?)

Seismological data indicate that this stress regime is still ongoing...|$|R

The resultant LOS velocity field is consistent with <b>dextral</b> <b>fault</b> motion, and it revealed a large velocity gradient across the Ushikubi fault, a major strand of the Atotsugawa fault system.
