50|$|<b>Gamma</b> <b>counters</b> {{are usually}} {{scintillation}} counters. In a typical system, {{a number of}} samples are placed in sealed vials or test tubes, and moved along a track. One at a time, they move down inside a shielded detector, set to measure specific energy windows characteristic of the particular isotope. Within this shielded detector there is a scintillation crystal that surrounds the radioactive sample. Gamma rays emitted from the radioactive sample interact with the crystal, are absorbed, and light is emitted. A detector, such as a photomultiplier tube converts the visible light to an electrical signal. Depending on the half-life and concentration of the sample, measurement times may vary from 0.02 minutes to several hours.|$|E

30|$|Although NaI(Tl) <b>gamma</b> <b>counters</b> play an {{important}} role in many quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) protocols, their calibration for positron-emitting samples has not been standardized across imaging sites.

30|$|The {{technical}} performance required for <b>gamma</b> <b>counters</b> {{intended for use}} with positron emitters differs slightly from the requirements for lower energy single-photon emitters. The NaI(Tl) crystal thickness needs to be optimized for 511 -keV photon detection. The shielding surrounding the detector needs to be sufficient to eliminate the penetrative 511 -keV emissions from nearby sources such as samples in adjacent rack positions. The count rate performance of the system needs to be adequate to accommodate the relatively high activities encountered in blood samples obtained during the early phase of kinetic studies. And while stable performance is desirable in all applications, it is particularly important for absolute quantification because sample counting may occur some time from the last system calibration. An additional consideration that affects studies involving both single-photon emitters and positron emitters {{is the loss of}} sensitivity with increasing sample volume [6]. When liquid samples are involved, this effect can usually be minimized by consistently counting samples of equal volume. However, this approach may not be feasible when counting solid tissue samples [7, 8] such as those obtained during pre-clinical biodistribution studies. Sample volume effects are, therefore, another important performance parameter when <b>gamma</b> <b>counters</b> are to be used with samples of potentially different sizes.|$|E

30|$|Historically, NaI(Tl) <b>gamma</b> <b>counters</b> {{have been}} an {{important}} instrument in nuclear medicine [1], {{and they continue to}} {{play a key role in}} modern practice. Clinical applications include in vitro studies of glomerular filtration rate, cerebrospinal fluid leak, red cell mass, and plasma volume [2]. <b>Gamma</b> <b>counters</b> are also widely used in conjunction with positron emission tomography (PET), typically in the research setting. PET applications include metabolite analysis [3], tracer kinetic studies [4], and pre-clinical biodistribution studies [5]. While quantitative accuracy is important in any setting, PET applications typically have slightly different quantitative requirements than clinical in vitro studies. Many in vitro tests involve comparison of the count rate obtained from patient samples with similar measurements of a reference source. Relative quantification of this sort can lead to an elegant elimination of errors, but it is frequently not applicable to PET studies where absolute quantification is often required. For example, in biodistribution studies, the radioactivity concentration in blood or tissue samples needs to be measured in absolute units (e.g., Bq/mL). Tracer kinetic studies require only that the gamma counter be calibrated in the same units as the PET images, which could potentially be in arbitrary units. However, much complexity can be avoided, particularly at sites that have multiple PET systems, if all instruments are calibrated in absolute units. In order to obtain gamma counter measurements with the required accuracy, careful isotope-specific calibration and an awareness of the operational range of the instrument are essential.|$|E

30|$|Another key {{consideration}} for PET applications is calibration accuracy. Whereas radionuclide calibrators (commonly {{referred to as}} dose calibrators) produce measurements that are directly presented in units of activity (e.g., Bq), gamma counter results are typically given in arbitrary units (counts per minute (CPM)). In order to convert these data into units of activity, users require {{an estimate of the}} efficiency of the gamma counter for the isotope of interest. Manufacturers often provide tables of efficiency values for various common isotopes, but the accuracy of these data can be uncertain or the appropriate measurement conditions may not be clearly defined. Analytic models have been developed to calculate efficiency [9], but these models are probably better suited to examining design trade-offs, rather than for predicting the efficiency of a specific device with high accuracy. Experimental measurement with reference to a radionuclide calibrator is a practical way of estimating efficiency, although this approach requires a meticulous experimental technique. Experimental errors can be introduced at numerous stages in a procedure that involves radionuclide calibrator measurement, phantom preparation, pipetting, sample weighing, and counting. Furthermore, experimental measurements of gamma counter efficiency are limited by the accuracy of the radionuclide calibrator. Recent developments have seen the introduction of 68 Ge/ 68 Ga sources that are specifically intended to aid calibration of radionuclide calibrators used in PET applications [10]. The activity in these sources is known with high accuracy and is traceable to a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard. Additionally, the geometry of the source has been designed to mimic a clinical syringe, and cross-calibration factors have been developed to account for the different decay characteristics of 68 Ge/ 68 Ga and 18 F. The use of these traceable sources has led to increased standardization and improved quantitative accuracy of radionuclide calibrators for 18 F. While these 68 Ge/ 68 Ga mock syringe sources are generally not compatible with <b>gamma</b> <b>counters</b> due to their size, companion sources designed for use with NaI(Tl) <b>gamma</b> <b>counters</b> have recently become available. These new 68 Ge/ 68 Ga gamma counter reference sources are implicitly traceable to an NIST standard and may help eliminate much of the experimental error associated with gamma counter calibration for positron-emitting isotopes.|$|E

30|$|An {{alternative}} approach involving an NIST-traceable 68 Ge/ 68 Ga source could potentially {{allow for a}} much simpler experimental procedure. The feasibility of this approach {{and the effect of}} the different decay characteristics of 18 F and 68 Ge/ 68 Ga were explored as follows.

This sample was counted using the 409 - to 613 -keV energy window with corrections for background, deadtime, and decay. The efficiency of the <b>gamma</b> <b>counter</b> was calculated for 68 Ge/ 68 Ga, based on the <b>gamma</b> <b>counter</b> measurements and the NIST-traceable activity of the source.
