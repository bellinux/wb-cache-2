5|$|In 2014, {{skeletal}} {{remains of a}} woman who lived around 425AD were discovered in the vicinity of Beachy Head on the Eastbourne Downland Estate. The remains were found to be of a 30 year-old woman who grew up in East Sussex, but had genetic heritage from sub-Saharan Africa, giving <b>her</b> <b>black</b> skin and an African skeletal structure. Her ancestors came from below the Saharan region, {{at a time when the}} Roman Empire extended only as far as North Africa.|$|E
5|$|When {{the news}} of Shankar's death reaches the Singh haveli, {{everyone}} turns somber and the ceremonies towards rendering her into a widow emotionally drains Meera. Her vivaciousness and exuberance are thrust behind <b>her</b> <b>black</b> veil. The {{rest of the family}} vents their frustration of losing their only bread-winner on Meera, by blaming her for bringing bad-luck to their family. Meera, being her respectful self, bears the insults silently.|$|E
5|$|While {{attending}} PCS, Johansson dated classmate Jack Antonoff from 2001 to 2002. She dated <b>her</b> <b>Black</b> Dahlia co-star Josh Hartnett {{for about}} two years until the end of 2006, with Hartnett citing their busy lives as the reason for their split. Johansson began a relationship with Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds in 2007, and in May 2008, they became engaged. In September 2008, the couple married in a quiet ceremony near Tofino, British Columbia. In December 2010, the couple announced their separation; their divorce was finalized in July 2011.|$|E

5|$|In her car, {{she packed}} clothing, toiletries, college textbooks, and birth-control pills. When her room was searched later, campus police {{discovered}} {{most of her}} belongings packed in boxes and the art removed from the walls. It's not clear whether Murray packed them that day, but police at the time asserted she'd packed between Sunday night and Monday morning. On top of the boxes was a printed email to Murray's boyfriend indicating trouble in their relationship. Around 3:30 pm, she drove off the campus in <b>her</b> <b>black</b> 1996 Saturn sedan; classes at the university had been canceled that day due to a snowstorm.|$|E
5|$|Back at Kiamo Ko, Elphaba {{has already}} {{captured}} Dorothy, refusing to release {{her until she}} relinquishes Nessarose's slippers – the only things left of her dead sister. Glinda travels to Elphaba's castle to warn her of the danger and persuade her to let Dorothy go. Elphaba refuses until she suddenly receives a letter saying that Fiyero has died. The two women forgive each other for all grievances, acknowledging they have both made mistakes. To help her in her future, Elphaba gives the Grimmerie to Glinda. The two friends embrace {{for the last time}} before saying goodbye forever, and acknowledge that they are who they are because of each other ("For Good"). As the mob arrives at the castle, Elphaba tells Glinda to hide, and she watches from the shadows as Dorothy throws a bucket of water on Elphaba, who appears to melt away. Grief-stricken, Glinda sees that all that remains of her friend is <b>her</b> <b>black</b> hat and the small bottle of green elixir which she had slept with under her pillow.|$|E
5|$|Erika Hügel-Marshall {{was born}} on 13 March 1947, {{the child of a}} Bavarian woman and an African-American soldier, Eddie Marshall, who had {{returned}} to the US before her birth. Her parents had met just after the end of World War II, after a relaxation of laws forbidding military personnel from interacting with civilians. According to <b>her,</b> <b>black</b> soldiers treated native German children well, distributing food and clothing, but her parents generally met in secret due to racist remarks from others. In November 1946 her father returned to the US after an illness. By that time, both of them knew that her mother was pregnant, but she did not know he was leaving until after he was already gone. A year after Ika's birth, her mother married a German and a half-sister was born the following year. Her mother and grandmother loved her and treated her like any other child, despite social disapproval. She was close to her half-sister, but her step-father was distant toward her.|$|E

5|$|In Bengal and South India, Shashthi is worshipped on {{the sixth}} day after {{childbirth}} and on Aranya-Shashthi (also called Jamai-Shashthi), the sixth day of the bright fortnight of the Hindu month of Jyeshtha. Her worship can be performed in the house, where she is symbolised as an earthenware pitcher; she may also be worshipped outdoors in a natural, open space consecrated to her, termed a shashthitala. In honour of Shashthi, women tie a stone in a small rag to the branch of a tree in the shasthitala: a mother does this to ask for long life for her child, while a barren woman does so to entreat the goddess to aid her in conceiving. The vrata (ritual) performed {{on the day of}} Jamai-Shashthi is also prescribed to be performed by pregnant women at least once on any Monday, Tuesday, Friday or Saturday in the month of Jyestha. Dough images of Shashthi and <b>her</b> <b>black</b> cat are prepared and worshipped, along with a water pitcher with a banyan tree branch near it. Betel nuts and leaves, fruits, sweets and kheer are offered to her in units of six. In North India, Shashthi is worshipped {{in the form of the}} banyan tree, which is sacred to her.|$|E
5|$|The {{engagement}} {{was declared}} on 5 December 1865, {{and despite the}} Prince of Wales's initial refusal to attend, Princess Alice intervened, and the wedding was a happy occasion. The Queen allowed the ceremony to take place at Windsor Castle, albeit in the Private Chapel rather than the grander St George's Chapel on 5 July 1866. The Queen relieved <b>her</b> <b>black</b> mourning dress with a white mourning cap which draped over her back. The main participants filed into the chapel {{to the sound of}} Beethoven's , creating a spectacle only marred by the sudden disappearance of Prince George, the Duke of Cambridge, who had a sudden gout attack. Christian filed into the chapel with his two supporters, Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar and Prince Frederic of Schleswig-Holstein, and Helena was given away by her mother, who escorted her up the aisle with the Prince of Wales and eight bridesmaids. Christian looked older than he was, and one guest commented that Helena looked as if she was marrying an aged uncle. Indeed, when he was first summoned to Britain, he assumed that the widowed Queen was inspecting him as a new husband for herself rather than as a candidate for one of her daughters. The couple spent the first night of their married life at Osborne House, before honeymooning in Paris, Interlaken and Genoa.|$|E

But Black Lady is purified back to Chibiusa when Sailor Moon assumed the appearance of Neo-Queen Serenity and embraced her.|$|E
25|$|Thérèse {{was sitting}} in a low chair, {{to the right of the}} fireplace. Chin in hand, she was staring fixedly at the dancing flames, and did not turn her head when Laurent entered the room.

25|$|The {{sinking of}} Dronning Maud, an unarmed ship flying Red Cross flags and {{carrying}} medical personnel, brought {{a great amount}} of anger and criticism directed against the Germans. From the Norwegian perspective Dronning Maud had been a hospital ship and under the protection of the Geneva Conventions. The Germans retorted by pointing out that Dronning Maud had not been fully marked as a hospital ship, as she had retained <b>her</b> <b>black</b> hull instead of it being painted white with a horizontal green stripe.|$|E
25|$|We {{were able}} to use archival pieces from Van Cleef & Arpels, which came with a {{revolving}} door of security guards. The jewelry schedule was very complicated, because pieces had to go from Switzerland to Paris, and the shooting schedule was changing constantly. It was really a house of cards. There were a couple of times we got caught, scenes got moved up, and lucky for me, Madonna was able to make available her personal jewelry. When you see Wallis spraying the flowers with perfume, <b>her</b> <b>black</b> and white pearl and diamond Bulgari earrings are Madonna's.|$|E

25|$|The third HMS Black Joke was {{probably}} built in Baltimore in 1824, becoming the Brazilian slave ship Henriquetta. The Royal Navy captured her in September 1827 and purchased {{her into the}} service. The Navy re-named <b>her</b> <b>Black</b> Joke, after an English song of the same name, and assigned her to the West Africa Squadron (or Preventative Squadron). Her role was to chase down slave ships, and over her five-year career she freed many hundreds of slaves. The Navy deliberately burnt her in May 1832 because her timbers had rotted {{to the point that}} she was no longer fit for active service.|$|E
25|$|On 2 April a Spanish 14-gun brig {{fired on}} Black Joke as she {{approached}} the brig. After two hours of exchanging shots, and after suffering several casualties, the brig hoisted a flag of truce. She {{turned out to be}} the Providentia, of 14 guns and a crew of 80 men. She had fired on the Black Joke as Providentias captain had been warned that a Colombian privateer answering to the same description as Black Joke was in the area. Turner therefore released <b>her.</b> <b>Black</b> Joke suffered no casualties; Providentia had numerous of her crew killed and wounded.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the success}} of these volumes, it was the release of Coal in 1976 that {{established}} Lorde as an influential voice in the Black Arts Movement, and the large publishing house behind it -- Norton -- helped introduce her to a wider audience. The volume includes poems from both The First Cities and Cables to Rage, and it unties many of the themes Lorde would become known for throughout her career: her rage at racial injustice, her celebration of <b>her</b> <b>black</b> identity, and her call for an intersectional consideration of women's experiences. Lorde followed Coal up with Between Our Selves (also in 1976) and Hanging Fire (1978).|$|E
