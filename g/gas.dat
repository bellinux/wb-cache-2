5|$|A Diver {{breathes}} a compressed <b>gas</b> mixture {{that contains}} inert <b>gas</b> which dissolves {{in the various}} tissues during the pressure exposure. When the ascent is initiated, the inert <b>gas</b> is off-loaded {{as soon as a}} suitable gradient is created.|$|E
5|$|A diving {{cylinder}}, scuba tank or {{diving tank}} is a <b>gas</b> cylinder used to store and transport the high pressure breathing <b>gas</b> required by a scuba set. It {{may also be}} used for surface-supplied diving or as decompression <b>gas</b> or an emergency <b>gas</b> supply for surface supplied diving or scuba. Cylinders provide <b>gas</b> to the diver through the demand valve of a diving regulator or the breathing loop of a diving rebreather.|$|E
5000|$|When <b>gassing</b> {{occurs in}} {{transformers}} {{there are several}} <b>gases</b> that are created. Enough useful information {{can be derived from}} nine <b>gases</b> so the additional <b>gases</b> are usually not examined. The nine <b>gases</b> examined are: ...|$|R
5000|$|The noble <b>gases</b> (helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon) {{are also}} <b>gases</b> at STP, {{but they are}} monatomic.

50|$|Diffusion of <b>gases</b> is {{configured}} with {{a uniform}} concentration of <b>gases</b> {{and while the}} <b>gases</b> are stationary. Diffusion is the change of concentration between the two <b>gases</b> due to a weaker concentration gradient between the two <b>gases.</b> Diffusion is the transportation of mass {{over a period of}} time.|$|R
5|$|A lattice <b>gas</b> {{automaton}} is {{a cellular}} automaton designed {{to simulate the}} motion of particles in a fluid or an ideal <b>gas.</b> In such a system, <b>gas</b> particles move on straight lines with constant velocity, until undergoing elastic collision with other particles. Lattice <b>gas</b> automata simplify these models by only allowing a constant number of velocities (typically, only one speed and either four or six directions of motion) and by simplifying the types of collision that are possible.|$|E
5|$|After an oil {{drilling}} operation in 1903 in Dexter, Kansas, produced a <b>gas</b> geyser {{that would not}} burn, Kansas state geologist Erasmus Haworth collected samples of the escaping <b>gas</b> and took {{them back to the}} University of Kansas at Lawrence where, with the help of chemists Hamilton Cady and David McFarland, he discovered that the <b>gas</b> consisted of, by volume, 72% nitrogen, 15% methane (a combustible percentage only with sufficient oxygen), 1% hydrogen, and 12% an unidentifiable <b>gas.</b> With further analysis, Cady and McFarland discovered that 1.84% of the <b>gas</b> sample was helium. This showed that despite its overall rarity on Earth, helium was concentrated in large quantities under the American Great Plains, available for extraction as a byproduct of natural <b>gas.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the <b>Gas</b> Boom {{began to}} sweep {{the state in the}} 1880s, Lilly and other Commercial Club members {{advocated}} the creation of a public corporation to pump natural <b>gas</b> from the ground, pipe it to Indianapolis from the Trenton <b>Gas</b> Field, and provide it at low cost to businesses and homes. The project {{led to the creation of}} the Consumer <b>Gas</b> Trust Company, which Lilly named. The <b>gas</b> company provided low-cost heating fuel that made urban living much more desirable. The <b>gas</b> was further used to create electricity to run Indianapolis's first public transportation venture, a streetcar system.|$|E

5|$|Argon {{may be used}} as {{the carrier}} <b>gas</b> in <b>gas</b> {{chromatography}} and in electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; it is the <b>gas</b> of choice for the plasma used in ICP spectroscopy. Argon is preferred for the sputter coating of specimens for scanning electron microscopy. Argon <b>gas</b> is also commonly used for sputter deposition of thin films as in microelectronics and for wafer cleaning in microfabrication.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Holocaust during World War II, German Nazis used <b>gas</b> vans at Chelmno {{extermination}} camp and elsewhere to kill an estimated over 700,000 prisoners by carbon monoxide poisoning. This method was also used in the <b>gas</b> chambers of several death camps such as Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec. Gassing with carbon monoxide started in action T4, the euthanasia programme developed by the Nazis in Germany to murder the mentally ill and disabled people before the war started in earnest. The <b>gas</b> was supplied by IG Farben in pressurized cylinders and fed by tubes into the <b>gas</b> chambers built at various mental hospitals, such as Hartheim Euthanasia Centre. Many key personnel were recruited from the T4 programme to murder much larger numbers {{of people in the}} <b>gas</b> vans and the special <b>gas</b> chambers used in the death camps such as Treblinka. Exhaust fumes from tank engines for example, were used to supply the <b>gas</b> to the chambers.|$|E
5|$|As with electricity, {{the natural}} <b>gas</b> {{distribution}} network is also now all-island, with a pipeline linking Gormanston, County Meath, and Ballyclare, County Antrim completed in 2007.

A decreasing supply {{is coming from}} the Kinsale <b>gas</b> field off the County Cork coast and the Corrib <b>Gas</b> Field off the coast of County Mayo has yet to come on-line. The County Mayo field is facing some localised opposition over a controversial decision to refine the <b>gas</b> onshore.|$|E

5|$|Charging {{an empty}} dive {{cylinder}} also causes a temperature rise as the <b>gas</b> inside the cylinder is compressed by the inflow of higher pressure <b>gas,</b> though this temperature rise may initially be tempered because compressed <b>gas</b> from a storage bank {{at room temperature}} decreases in temperature when it decreases in pressure, so at first the empty cylinder is charged with cold <b>gas,</b> but {{the temperature of the}} <b>gas</b> in the cylinder then increases to above ambient as the cylinder fills to the working pressure.|$|E
5|$|Deck {{decompression}} chambers {{are used}} for surface decompression, described in a previous section. Most deck decompression chambers are fitted with built in breathing systems (BIBS), which supply an alternative breathing <b>gas</b> to the occupants (usually oxygen), and discharge the exhaled <b>gas</b> outside the chamber, so the chamber <b>gas</b> is not excessively enriched by oxygen, which would cause an unacceptable fire hazard, and require frequent flushing with chamber <b>gas</b> (usually air).|$|E

Noble <b>gases</b> are also called as aerogens but this nomenclature of the group is not officially accepted by the IUPAC.|$|R
