[...] Consider, for example, an op-amp configured for a gain of 10. [...] Let the input be a 1 V, 100kHz sawtooth wave. That is, the amplitude is 1 V and the period is 10 microseconds. Accordingly, the rate of change (i.e., the slope) of the input is 0.1 V per microsecond. [...] After 10x amplification, the output should be a 10 V, [...] 100kHz sawtooth, with a corresponding slew rate of 1 V per microsecond. [...] However, the classic 741 op-amp has a 0.5 V per microsecond slew rate specification, so that its output can rise to no more than 5 V in the sawtooth's 10 microsecond period. Thus, if one were to measure the output, it would be a 5 V, 100kHz sawtooth, rather than a 10 V, 100kHz sawtooth.Next consider the same amplifier and 100kHz sawtooth, but now the input amplitude is 100 mV rather than 1 V. [...] After 10x amplification the output is a 1 V, 100kHz sawtooth with a corresponding slew rate of 0.1 V per microsecond. [...] In this instance the 741 with its 0.5 V per microsecond slew rate will amplify the input properly.Modern high speed op-amps can have slew rates in excess of 5,000 V per microsecond. However, it is more common for op-amps to have slew rates in the range 5-100 V per microsecond. [...] For example, the general purpose TL081 op-amp has a slew rate of 13 V per microsecond.

The photoconduction mechanism in these devices has been elucidated by means of time-resolved measurements spanning a wide temporal domain, from 10 - 9 to 102 s, revealing the coexistence of fast (ô 20 ns) and slow (ô 10 s) components of the carrier relaxation dynamics. The extremely high photoconductive gain is attributed {{to the presence of}} oxygen-related hole-trap states at the NW surface, which prevents charge-carrier recombination and prolongs the photocarrier lifetime, as evidenced by the sensitivity of the photocurrrent to ambient conditions.

40|$|Distributed {{amplifiers}} enable achieving {{very high}} <b>gain-bandwidth</b> <b>products.</b> This {{is achieved by}} means of combining the output current of transistors placed along tapped delay lines. Due {{to the need for}} half of the output current to be dissipated in a termination resistor, and the additive instead of multiplicative gain-contribution of the stages., the distributed amplifier is easily dismissed as being too inefficient for low-power applications. However, applying transmission line tapering and other techniques, the distributed amplifier is able to match the low power-consumption (13 mW) of resistive-feedback amplifiers while offering a high gain (15. 8 dB) over a 22 GHz bandwidth [1] (Fig. 1 - 2). In addition, the amplifier features an average noise figure of only 5. 4 dB across the 22 GHz band. Due to optimization for mimimum power-consumption and the high gain, the presented amplifier does exhibit relatively low linearity (average IIP 3 of - 7. 3 dBm). However, the cascaded topology allows tuning the first stage for noise and the second stage for linearity, facilitating the design of a highly-linear low-noise ampliﬁer. Driving the second-stage transistors more into saturation, linearity performance can be increased dramatically (0 dBm IIP 3), but at the cost of increasing the power consumption to 47 mW. The gain also increases to 18 dB. In order to limit the increase in power consumption, degeneration resistors can be employed [2]. Inserting 30 -Ohm resistors (Fig. 3) lowers the gain to 14 dB and the power consumption to 26 mW, but retains the high linearity (0 dBm IIP 3). The resulting amplifier topology offers all the properties of the original design, but additionally shows much improved linearity performance at only a moderate increase in power consumption. [1] B.

50|$|The {{superheterodyne}} receiver has several advantages over previous receiver designs. One advantage is easier tuning; only the RF and LO are tuned by the operator; the fixed-frequency IF is tuned ("aligned") {{at the factory}} and is not adjusted. In older designs such as the tuned radio frequency receiver (TRF), all of the receiver stages had to be simultaneously tuned. In addition, since the IF filters are fixed-tuned, the receiver's selectivity is the same across the receiver's entire frequency band. Another advantage is that the IF signal can be {{at a much lower}} frequency than the incoming radio signal, and that allows each stage of the IF amplifier to provide more gain. To first order, an amplifying device has a fixed <b>gain-bandwidth</b> <b>product.</b> If the device has a <b>gain-bandwidth</b> <b>product</b> of 60 MHz, then it can provide a voltage gain of 3 at an RF of 20 MHz or a voltage gain of 30 at an IF of 2 MHz. At a lower IF, it would take fewer gain devices to achieve the same gain. The regenerative radio receiver obtained more gain out of one gain device by using positive feedback, but it required careful adjustment by the operator; that adjustment also changed the selectivity of the regenerative receiver. The superheterodyne provides a large, stable, gain and constant selectivity without troublesome adjustment.|$|E

40|$|The {{advancement}} in integrated circuit (IC) technology {{has resulted in}} scaling down of device sizes and supply voltages without proportionally scaling down the threshold voltage of the MOS transistor. This, coupled with the increasing demand for low power, portable, battery-operated electronic devices, like mobile phones, and laptops provides the impetus for further research towards achieving higher integration on chip and low power consumption. High gain, wide bandwidth amplifiers driving large capacitive loads serve as error amplifiers in low-voltage low drop out regulators in portable devices. This demands low power, low area, and frequency-compensated multistage amplifiers capable of driving large capacitive loads. The {{first part of the}} research proposes two power and area efficient frequency compensation schemes: Single Miller Capacitor Compensation (SMC) and Single Miller Capacitor Feedforward Compensation (SMFFC), for multistage amplifiers driving large capacitive loads. The designs have been implemented in a 0. 5 ??m CMOS process. Experimental results show that the SMC and SMFFC amplifiers achieve <b>gain-bandwidth</b> <b>products</b> of 4. 6 MHz and 9 MHz, respectively, when driving a load of 25 K&# 948;/ 120 pF. Each amplifier operates from a ?? 1 V supply, dissipates less than 0. 42 mW of power and occupies less than 0. 02 mm 2 of silicon area. The inception of the latest IEEE standard like IEEE 802. 16 wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN) for 10 - 66 GHz range demands wide band amplifiers operating at high frequencies to serve as front-end circuits (e. g. low noise amplifier) in such receiver architectures. Devices used in cascade (multistage amplifiers) can be used to increase the gain but it is achieved at an expense of bandwidth. Distributing the capacitance associated with the input and the output of the device over a ladder structure (which is periodic), rather than considering it to be lumped can achieve an extension of bandwidth without sacrificing gain.

Generation of broadband power at mm-waves is challenging because a key target such as the efficiency trades with the <b>gain-bandwidth</b> (GBW) <b>product.</b> The major limit is the capacitive parasitics at the interstage between driver and power devices. The latter are designed with a large form factor so as to deliver the desired output power and are commonly biased in class-AB to achieve high drain efficiency, penalizing GBW.

Leveraging inductively coupled resonators, we apply Norton transformations for impedance scaling. In both networks, topological transformations are employed to include a transformer, achieve the desired load impedance and minimize the number of components.
