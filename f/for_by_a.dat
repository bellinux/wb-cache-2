5|$|After {{considering}} the Royal Commission's recommendations the Dutch Government decided to purchase four battleships. All the ships {{were to be}} permanently stationed in the NEI, and none would be used in European waters. The ships were larger than those proposed by the commission, however. Idenburg opposed this decision, and unsuccessfully argued {{for at least a}} fifth battleship to be built. In October 1913 it was rumored that the Government was about to order the first ship, {{and that it would be}} paid <b>for</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> loan borne by NEI.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented of equilibrium in six specimens of garnet-biotite-sillimanite-plagioclase-potash feldspar-quartz [...] . gneiss from a metamorphic terrain in south-western Quebec. A nearly uniform Ti content of biotite may be accounted <b>for</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> equilibrium (a) involving biotite, sillimanite, quartz, garnet, potash feldspar, and H 2 O. The {{nature of the}} distribution of Fe and Mg between garnet and biotite may be accounted <b>for</b> <b>by</b> another equilibrium (b) involving the same mineral suite, or <b>by</b> <b>a</b> simple exchange equilibrium (c) involving only garnet and biotite. The distribution of Mn between garnet and biotite is accounted <b>for</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> exchange equilibrium (d). A nearly uniform value of the ratio Ca content of plagioclase/Ca content of garnet may be accounted <b>for</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> equilibrium (e) involving plagioclase, garnet, sillimanite, and quartz. A proposed equilibrium (f) involving biotite, quartz, ilmenite, potash feldspar, sillimanite, and H 2 O conflicts with equilibrium (a) and was evidently not established in the gneisses. The factors governing the Ca content of biotite remain largely unknown. Some of these equilibria form potential indicators of relative geologic temperature, pressure, and chemical potential of H 2 O...|$|R

5|$|The {{differences}} between these two deposits can be accounted <b>for</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> few factors, including time of eruption and placement. The material inside the caldera must be younger and erupted {{from a pool of}} magma that had larger crystals. Its extensive erosion {{can be explained by the}} presence of hydrothermal vents, and its high levels of lithics probably originate from either being exposed to the rocks after they were erupted, lying adjacent to them while they underwent subsidence, or is a result of long, slow formation. Any of these reasons would also effectively account for the poor mixing of the lavas.|$|E

5|$|By 1922, {{concerns}} {{had grown}} {{about the condition}} of the castle and discussions took place between the Penard Golf Club, who owned the site, the Royal Institution and the Cambrian Archaeological Association. A joint committee was formed to raise the funds for repairs to the stonework but the costs appear to have been excessive and instead the gatehouse was patched with concrete between 1923 and 1924. Much of the remaining southern wall collapsed at the beginning of 1960 and an archaeological survey was conducted between 1960 and 1961. Urgent masonry repairs were then carried out in 1963, paid <b>for</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> combination of the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works, the Gower Society, the golf club and a public appeal launched by local newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Gray's Almshouses on East Street {{were founded}} by Robert Gray in 1615 for poor single women. The red brick {{buildings}} bear {{the arms of}} Robert Gray, dated 1635, and another arms of the Merchant Tailors. A small room is used as chapel and has original benches and a painted ceiling. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building. St Margaret's Almshouses was founded as a leper colony in the 12th century. Glastonbury Abbey acquired the patronage of the hospital in the late 13thcentury and rebuilt it as almshouses in the early 16th century. From 1612 to 1938 the building continued {{to be used as}} almshouses, cared <b>for</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> local parish. In the late 1930s it was converted into a hall of offices for the Rural Community Council and accommodation for the Somerset Guild of Craftsmen. It later fell into disrepair until the Somerset Buildings Preservation Trust with Falcon Rural Housing purchased and restored it for use as four dwellings of social housing. It is a gradeII* listed building.|$|E

In 1944 he married again. His second wife was the actress Meriel Forbes, a member of the Forbes-Robertson theatrical family. The marriage brought him lifelong happiness and a son, Charles (1945–98), who became a television stage manager.|$|E

5|$|Lathrop House was {{the third}} {{residential}} quadrangle (quad) dormitory built {{on the campus of}} Vassar College in the town of Poughkeepsie, New York. The college built Lathrop during a period of rapid dorm construction spanning 1893–1902 during which the older seminary-style model of housing—a single large hall in which all a college's residents lived, in Vassar's case Main Building—was quickly waning in popularity in favor of smaller individual houses. The project began with the opening of Strong House in 1893 and continued with Raymond House in 1897; Lathrop followed in 1901, and Davison House's erection completed the quad in 1902. Construction of the dorm was paid for with Vassar's funds, unlike Strong House which had been paid <b>for</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> gift from John D. Rockefeller.|$|E
5|$|Mathilde's orbit is eccentric, {{taking it}} to the outer reaches of the main belt. Nonetheless, the orbit lies entirely between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter; it does not cross the {{planetary}} orbits. It also has one of the slowest rotation periods of the known asteroidsmost asteroids have a rotation period in the range of 224 hours. Because of the slow rotation rate, NEAR Shoemaker was only able to photograph 60% of the asteroid's surface. The slow rate of rotation may be accounted <b>for</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> satellite orbiting the asteroid, but a search of the NEAR images revealed none larger than 10km in diameter out to 20 times the radius of Mathilde.|$|E
5|$|Montgomery County, Maryland, {{similarly}} approved {{plans to}} install 20 stations and 200 bikes in the Rockville and Shady Grove areas near Washington Metro stations and high-traffic destinations such as Montgomery College and Rockville Town Center. The expansion {{will be paid}} <b>for</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> $1.288 million grant from the National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board with a $688,000 local match. Officials also cited plans to add 50 stations and 400 bicycles in southern areas of the county, including Bethesda, Silver Spring, Friendship Heights, and Takoma Park. However, bicycling advocates cautioned that clusters of stations in the county could be too far from each other {{as well as the}} larger network of stations within neighboring Washington, D.C. There was also concern that the county has too few bike lanes and trails to support the expected number of users. Despite these concerns, Montgomery County added its first stations in May 2013.|$|E

Bumgarner would hit an opposite-field leadoff double off the bricks, becoming the first Giants pitcher to record a pinch-hit double in a pitch-hitting appearance since Ray Sadecki did so in , according to CSN Bay Area. The Giants inserted pinch-runner and another fellow rotation mate Jeff Samardzija, who would score later in the inning, marking the first occurrence in a San Francisco Giants game that a pinch-hitting pitcher reached base, was substituted <b>for</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> pinch-running pitcher, and scored a run.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{requirements}} of the Foundling Hospital was that babies were to be less than six months old at the time of admittance, but the hospital did not keep more accurate records of age. Another requirement was that foundlings were given a new name and a reference number, so Sabrina became Girl Ann Kingston no. 4759. She was taken in by a wet nurse, Mary Penfold, who brought her to Wotton, Surrey, where she remained until 1759, when she was two years old. Although it was usual for foundlings to remain with their wet nurse until the age of five or six, the Foundling Hospital had received an influx of new babies and moved many children who no longer required nursing, including Sabrina, to the Shrewsbury branch of the Foundling Hospital. The Shrewsbury building was not completed until 1765, so in the meantime Sabrina and another foundling were cared <b>for</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> nurse, Ann Casewell, at her home.|$|E
5|$|The Seahawks {{played their}} home {{games at the}} Kingdome from their 1976 inaugural season until 1999. In 1995 a {{proposal}} was made to issue county bonds to fund a remodeling project of the facility. The proposal failed, and as a result, Seahawks' owner Ken Behring threatened to sell or move the team. In 1997 local billionaire Paul Allen pledged to acquire the team if a new stadium could be built {{and said that the}} team could not be profitable until they left the Kingdome. He asked the state legislature to hold a special statewide referendum on a proposal to finance a new stadium. Allen also agreed to cover any cost overruns. With Allen agreeing to pay the $4million cost, the legislature agreed. The vote was scheduled to be held in June 1997 but in May a Seattle resident filed a lawsuit that claimed the legislature did not have authority to call for such a vote, since it would be paid <b>for</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> private party who could gain from the result. The case was delayed until after the vote. The proposal was pitched to voters as providing both a new home for the Seahawks and a venue for top-level soccer. It passed on June 17, 1997, with 820,364 (51.1%) in favor and 783,584 against. The vote was close in Seattle, but it received 60% approval in Seattle's northern and eastern suburbs. The public funding was unpopular farther away in the eastern portion of the state. In October, a Thurston County Superior Court judge ruled that the legislature acted properly and in the public's interest, and he dismissed the pending lawsuit. The Washington Supreme Court upheld the decision that December.|$|E

5|$|The century {{following}} 1750 {{was time}} of significant change.

The aftermath of the Battle of Culloden {{marked the beginning of the}} end for the clan system and whilst there were marked improvements in living standards for some, these transformations came at a cost for others. In the early 19th century Alexander, 10th Duke of Hamilton (1767–1852) embarked on a programme of clearances that had a devastating effect on Arran's population. Whole villages were removed and the Gaelic culture of the island dealt a terminal blow.

5|$|This {{ability to}} provide {{real-time}} tissue loading data allows the computer to indicate the diver's current decompression obligation, and to update it for any permissible profile change, so the diver with a decompression ceiling {{does not have to}} decompress at any specific depth provided the ceiling is not violated, though the decompression rate will be affected by the depth. As a result, the diver can make a slower ascent than would be called <b>for</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> decompression schedule computed by the identical algorithm, as may suit the circumstances, and will be credited for gas elimination during the slower ascent, and penalized if necessary for additional ingassing for those tissues affected.
