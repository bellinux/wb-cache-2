40|$|Aim: to {{evaluate}} the performance of Vitek 2 <b>compact</b> <b>machine</b> (Biomerieux Inc. ver 04. 02, France) in reference to manual methods for susceptibility test for Candida resistance among HIV/AIDS patients. Methods: a comparison study {{to evaluate}} Vitek 2 <b>compact</b> <b>machine</b> (Biomerieux Inc. ver 04. 02, France) in reference to manual methods for susceptibility test for Candida resistance among HIV/AIDS patient was done. Categorical agreement between manual disc diffusion and Vitek 2 machine was calculated using predefined criteria. Time to susceptibility result for automated and manual methods were measured. Results: there were 137 Candida isolates comprising eight Candida species with C. albicans and C. glabrata as the first (56. 2 %) and second (15. 3 %) most common species, respectively. For fluconazole drug, among the C. albicans, 2. 6 % was found resistant on manual disc diffusion methods and no resistant was determined by Vitek 2 machine; whereas 100 % C. krusei was identified as resistant on both methods. Resistant patterns for C. glabrata to fluconazole, voriconazole and amphotericin B were 52. 4 %, 23. 8 %, 23. 8 % vs. 9. 5 %, 9. 5 %, 4. 8 % respectively between manual diffusion disc methods and Vitek 2 machine. Time to susceptibility result for automated methods compared to Vitex 2 machine was shorter for all Candida species.
