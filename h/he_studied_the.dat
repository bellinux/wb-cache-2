5|$|After leaving {{elementary}} school in 1893, Kafka {{was admitted to the}} rigorous classics-oriented state gymnasium, , an academic secondary school at Old Town Square, within the Kinský Palace. German was the language of instruction, but Kafka also spoke and wrote in Czech. <b>He</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> latter at the gymnasium for eight years, achieving good grades. Although Kafka received compliments for his Czech, he never considered himself fluent in Czech, though he spoke German with a Czech accent. He completed his Matura exams in 1901.|$|E

5|$|After the {{partitions}} of Poland, {{in which}} Russia, Prussia, and Austria seized {{all of the}} Commonwealth's territory, Staszic was active in many scientific and scholarly initiatives. <b>He</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> geology of the Carpathian Mountains.

5|$|Between 1929 and 1935, {{under the}} strain of World Depression, {{political}} thinking worldwide received a jolt from the spread of international communism. Indian political parties, movements and considerable sections of leadership were also affected by inter-continental ideologies. The Self-Respect Movement also came {{under the influence of}} the leftist philosophies and institutions. E.V. Ramasamy, after establishing the Self-Respect Movement as an independent institution, began to look for ways to strengthen it politically and socially. To accomplish this, <b>he</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> history and politics of different countries, and personally observed these systems at work.|$|E
5|$|Dr Eric Underwood {{began his}} {{research}} at Avondale in the mid-1930s also utilising the sheep flocks.

These experiments were {{the first of many}} by Underwood over the next 30 years. During the 1940s <b>he</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> nutritional value of hay and pasture for sheep, the ongoing results from these Studies in Cereal Hay production in Western Australia were published in the Journal of Agriculture.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Smyth {{worked in}} the Chemical Warfare Service and at the Aberdeen Proving Ground.

5|$|For random {{walks in}} -dimensional integer lattices, George Pólya {{published}} in 1919 and 1921 work, where <b>he</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> {{probability of a}} symmetric random walk returning to a previous position in the lattice. Pólya showed that a symmetric random walk, which has an equal probability to advance in any direction in the lattice, will return to a previous position in the lattice {{an infinite number of}} times with probability one in one and two dimensions, but with probability zero in three or higher dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Hewett {{suspended}} {{his research}} during Judd's 1924–27 excavation of Pueblo Bonito, {{financed by the}} National Geographic Society, but returned to Chetro Ketl in 1929 with graduate students from his newly founded Department of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of New Mexico. <b>He</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> canyon until 1935, and several Chaco scholars worked for or with him during this period, including Gordon Vivian (father of R. Gwinn Vivian), Edwin Ferdon, Paul Reiter, and Florence M. Hawley. Hewett's methods have been widely criticized, and his work judged to have been substandard, particularly {{in comparison to the}} work done by the National Geographic Project. He spent several years excavating Chetro Ketl, but never published a detailed account of his research there. Despite this, much is known about his studies from the theses and dissertations written by students who worked with him.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Compton {{was awarded}} {{one of the}} first two National Research Council Fellowships that allowed {{students}} to study abroad. He chose to go to Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory in England, where <b>he</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> scattering and absorption of gamma rays. Further research along these lines led to the discovery of the Compton effect. He used X-rays to investigate ferromagnetism, concluding that it was a result of the alignment of electron spins, and studied cosmic rays, discovering that they were made up principally of positively charged particles.|$|E

5|$|In 1930 Allison {{returned}} to the University of Chicago, where he became a professor in 1942, and the Frank P. Hixon Distinguished Service Professor of Physics in 1959. <b>He</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> Compton effect and the dynamical theory of x-ray diffraction. At the time x-rays were an important means of investigating atomic structures, but the concept that light had both wave and particle properties, as demonstrated by Arthur Compton, was not universally accepted. William Duane from Harvard spearheaded an effort to prove that Compton's interpretation of the Compton effect was wrong, and Allison became part of this effort. Duane carried {{out a series of}} meticulous experiments to disprove Compton, but instead found overwhelming evidence that Compton was correct. To his credit, Duane conceded that this was the case.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{decided to}} bring back his other two squads to form a solid line and, expecting to be gone only a few minutes, he left his SCR-300 radio behind. Jones found one squad but the other had gone on farther and was not visible. While <b>he</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> terrain and waited for a {{messenger}} he had sent to bring back that last squad, North Koreans attacked the main company position behind him. Judging by the noise he heard, Jones thought North Koreans had moved in force to the wooded bowl {{between him and the}} rest of the company. Jones never got back to his 3rd Squad. He {{and the rest of the}} platoon dropped down off the ridge into a gully on the left.|$|E

However, around the same time, Crown Prince Taufa'ahau Tupou IV returned from a trip to Australia where he realized that some changes should be made to the written Tongan language. Morton began working on a revised draft, but felt unacquainted with Tongan grammar. For a year, <b>he</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> language and finally completely his revision on March 15, 1945.

5|$|O'Connell {{was born}} to {{distinguished}} lawyer Charles O'Connell in 1849 in Ennis, County Clare, Ireland, some {{two years after the}} death of his famed grand-uncle Daniel O'Connell. Young O'Connell attended Belvedere College, a Jesuit school in Dublin, but was called home at the deaths of his mother and sister in a coach accident. This tragic event was later judged to be the source of O'Connell's sense of the impermanence of the world. After the funeral, he was transferred without enthusiasm to Clongowes Wood College where <b>he</b> <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> classics for three years. O'Connell signed on with the Royal Navy as a midshipman. He travelled around Cape Horn to California in 1868.|$|E
