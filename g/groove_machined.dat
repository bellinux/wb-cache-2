With metallic cases, this ability is provided by a rim or extractor <b>groove</b> <b>machined</b> into the rear of the case. Even in completely plastic bodied cartridges, such as the Activ brand shotgun shells, a thin metal ring is molded into the rim to provide support for the extractor.

50|$|Manifolds {{intended}} for use with sets where a regulator is provided for each cylinder {{are connected to the}} cylinder valves upstream of the cylinder valve seat, to a connecting port provided specifically for this purpose. Two styles of connection are available for this arrangement - face seal, and barrel seal. Face seal connections are similar to the DIN regulator connection seal, and consist of an o-ring in a <b>groove</b> <b>machined</b> into the end of the manifold tube, which is clamped against the face of the valve port by a threaded component. Face seals are simple and rugged, but rely on tight connection for a reliable seal, and do not allow any adjustment for cylinder centre distance. Barrel seals use one or two O-rings in grooves around the end of the manifold tube, which seal against the bore of the valve port. They are usually screwed into the valve port with handed thread, and locked with a lock-nut. They are generally slightly less rugged than face seal manifolds, and more vulnerable to thread damage during assembly, but allow a small amount of cylinder centre distance adjustment, and provide a reliable seal even if not completely tight. Manifolds of this type are commonly supplied in sets comprising a manifold and compatible left and right side cylinder valves with a choice of neck thread specification. The working components for all three valves in the set are usually identical.|$|E

The considered oil pump system consists of a centrifugal pump immersed in the oil sump of the hermetic compressor and a helical <b>groove</b> <b>machined</b> on the crankshaft. The focus of this work lies on the immersed part of the centrifugal oil pump and its interaction with the oil in the oil sump.

40|$|Nano-droplet-enriched {{cutting fluid}} (NDCF) {{demonstrates}} a linear spreading rate when {{measured by a}} contact angle goniometer. The spreading continues beyond that a conventional goniometer can measure. Such thinness allows NDCF to penetrate deep into the tool-chip and tool-workpiece interfaces to affect the lubrication. In this paper, straight taper cutting was carried out using a single-point diamond tool. By examining the <b>groove</b> <b>machined,</b> the enhancement effect of NDCF on improving the surface roughness, reducing bouncing back, and suppressing form irregularities could be quantified. Without NDCF, form irregularities {{were found on the}} surface of the grooves in the nature of random localized upheavals. For shallow cuts, NDCF could stabilize the cutting with a depth of cut (DoC) below 1 mu m and down to around 0. 75 mu m, so that the roundness of the machined groove could be maintained precisely. Whereas for deeper cuts, NDCF was found to be effective in preventing form irregularities and on reducing bounce back for a DoC larger than 1. 5 mu m. Regarding bounce back, the experimental work revealed that NDCF can prevent form irregularities from occurring when the DoC is beyond 1. 5 mu m. For those samples machined using a conventional oil lubricant, distorted rebounding with a magnitude as large as 200 nm was not uncommon. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Refractive index (RI) sensing is a {{powerful}} noninvasive and label-free sensing technique for the identification, detection and monitoring of microfluidic samples {{with a wide range}} of possible sensor designs such as interferometers and resonators [1, 2]. Most of the existing RI sensing applications focus on biological materials in aqueous solutions in visible and IR frequencies, such as DNA hybridization and genome sequencing. At terahertz frequencies, applications include quality control, monitoring of industrial processes and sensing and detection applications involving nonpolar materials. Several potential designs for refractive index sensors in the terahertz regime exist, including photonic crystal waveguides [3], asymmetric splitring resonators [4], and photonic band gap structures integrated into parallel-plate waveguides [5]. Many of these designs are based on optical resonators such as rings or cavities. The resonant frequencies of these structures are dependent on the refractive index of the material in or around the resonator. By monitoring the shifts in resonant frequency the refractive index of a sample can be accurately measured and this in turn can be used to identify a material, monitor contamination or dilution, etc. The sensor design we use here is based on a simple parallel-plate waveguide [6, 7]. A rectangular <b>groove</b> <b>machined</b> into one face acts as a resonant cavity (Figures 1 and 2). When terahertz radiation is coupled into the waveguide and propagates in the lowest-order transverse-electric (TE 1) mode, the result is a single strong resonant feature with a tunable resonant frequency that is dependent on the geometry of the groove [6, 8]. This groove can be filled with nonpolar liquid microfluidic samples which cause a shift in the observed resonant frequency that depends on the amount of liquid in the groove and its refractive index [9]. Our technique has an advantage over other terahertz techniques in its simplicity, both in fabrication and implementation, since the procedure can be accomplished with standard laboratory equipment without the need for a clean room or any special fabrication or experimental techniques. It can also be easily expanded to multichannel operation by the incorporation of multiple grooves [10]. In this video we will describe our complete experimental procedure, from the design of the sensor to the data analysis and determination of the sample refractive index...|$|E
40|$|In the ﬁeld of turbomachinery, {{vibration}} amplitude is often reduced by dissipating the kinetic {{energy of the}} blades with devices that utilize dry friction. Under-platform dampers, for example, are often placed in the underside of two consecutive turbine blades. Dampers are kept {{in contact with the}} under-platform of the respective blades by means of the cen-trifugal force. If the damper is well designed, vibration of blades instigate a relative motion between the under-platform and the damper. A friction force, that is a non-conservative force, arises in the contact and partly dissipates the vibration energy. Several contact mod-els are available in the literature to simulate the contact between the damper and the under-platform. However, the actual dynamics of the blade-damper interaction have not fully understood yet. Several test rigs have been previously developed to experimentally investigate the performance of under-platform dampers. The majority of these experimen-tal setups aim to evaluate the overall damper efﬁciency in terms of reduction in response amplitude of the blade for a given exciting force that simulates the aerodynamic loads. Unfortunately, the experimental data acquired on the blade dynamics do not provide enough information to understand the damper dynamics. Therefore, the uncertainty on the damper behavior remains a big issue. In this work, a novel experimental test rig has been developed to extensively investigate the damper dynamic behavior. A single replaceable blade is clamped in the rig with a speci-ﬁc clamping device. With this device the blade root is pressed against a <b>groove</b> <b>machined</b> in the test rig. The pushing force is controllable and measurable, to better simulate the actual centrifugal load acting on the blade. Two dampers, one {{on each side of the}} blade, are in con-tact with the blade under-platforms and with platforms on force measuring supports. These supports have been speciﬁcally designed to measure the contact forces on the dam-per. The contact forces on the blade are computed by post processing the measured forces and assuming the static equilibrium of the damper. The damper kinematics is rebuilt by using the relative displacement, measured with a differential laser, between the damper and the blade under-platform. This article describes the main concepts behind this new approach and explains the design and working of this novel test rig. Moreover, the inﬂuence of the damper contact forces on the dynamic behavior of the blade is discussed in the result section...|$|E

40|$|Atomic force {{microscope}} (AFM) tip-based nanomachining {{is currently}} the object of intense research investigations. Values of the load applied to the tip at the free end of the AFM cantilever probe used for nanomachining are always large enough to induce plastic deformation on the specimen surface contrary to the small load values used for the conventional contact mode AFM imaging. This study describes an important phenomenon specific for AFM nanomachining in the forward direction: under certain processing conditions, the deformed shape of the cantilever probe may change from a convex to a concave orientation.
