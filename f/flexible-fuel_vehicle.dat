5|$|Sweden has {{achieved}} the largest E85 <b>flexible-fuel</b> <b>vehicle</b> fleet in Europe, {{with a sharp}} growth from 717 vehicles in 2001 to 243,136 through December 2014. As of 2008 a total of 70% of all flexifuel vehicles operating in the EU were registered in Sweden. The recent and accelerated growth of the Swedish fleet of E85 flexifuel vehicles {{is the result of}} the National Climate Policy in Global Cooperation Bill passed in 2005, which not only ratified the Kyoto Protocol but also sought to meet the 2003 EU Biofuels Directive regarding targets for use of biofuels, and also let to the 2006 government's commitment to eliminate oil imports by 2020.|$|E
5|$|A <b>flexible-fuel</b> <b>vehicle</b> (FFV) or {{dual-fuel vehicle}} (colloquially called a flex-fuel vehicle) is an {{alternative}} fuel vehicle with an internal combustion engine designed to run {{on more than one}} fuel, usually gasoline blended with either ethanol or methanol fuel, and both fuels are stored in the same common tank. Modern flex-fuel engines are capable of burning any proportion of the resulting blend in the combustion chamber as fuel injection and spark timing are adjusted automatically according to the actual blend detected by a fuel composition sensor. Flex-fuel vehicles are distinguished from bi-fuel vehicles, where two fuels are stored in separate tanks and the engine runs on one fuel at a time, for example, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Ireland is {{the third}} best seller European market of E85 flex-fuel vehicles, after Sweden and France. Bioethanol (E85) in Ireland is made from whey, a waste product of cheese manufacturing. The Irish {{government}} established several incentives, including a 50% discount in vehicle registration taxes (VRT), which can {{account for more than}} one third of the retail price of a new car in Ireland (around €6,500). The bioethanol element of the E85 fuel is excise-free for fuel companies, allowing retail prices to be low enough to offset the 25 per cent cut in fuel economy that E-85 cars offer, due to ethanol's lower energy content than gasoline. Also, the value added tax (VAT) on the fuel can also be claimed back. E-85 fuel is available across the country in more than 20 of Maxol service stations. In October 2005, the 1.8 Ford Focus FFV became the first <b>flexible-fuel</b> <b>vehicle</b> to be commercially sold in Ireland. Later Ford launched the C-max and the Mondeo flexifuel models. Saab and Volvo also have E85 models available.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} commercially {{available}} FFV {{in the world}} market is the ethanol <b>flexible-fuel</b> <b>vehicle,</b> with about 49 million automobiles, motorcycles and light duty trucks manufactured and sold worldwide by mid 2015, and concentrated in four markets, Brazil (29.5million by mid 2015), the United States (17.4million {{by the end of}} 2014), Canada (1.6million by 2014), and Europe, led by Sweden (243,100). The Brazilian flex fuel fleet includes over 4million flexible-fuel motorcycles produced since 2009 through March 2015. In addition to flex-fuel vehicles running with ethanol, in Europe and the US, mainly in California, there have been successful test programs with methanol flex-fuel vehicles, known as M85 flex-fuel vehicles. There have been also successful tests using P-series fuels with E85 flex fuel vehicles, but as of June 2008, this fuel is not yet available to the general public. These successful tests with P-series fuels were conducted on Ford Taurus and Dodge Caravan flexible-fuel vehicles.|$|E

25|$|A {{conventional}} vehicle {{can become}} a greener vehicle by mixing in renewable fuels or using less carbon intensive fossil fuel. Typical gasoline-powered cars can tolerate up to 10% ethanol. Brazil manufactured cars that run on neat ethanol, though there were discontinued. Another available option is a <b>flexible-fuel</b> <b>vehicle</b> which allows any blend of gasoline and ethanol, up to 85% in North America and Europe, and up to 100% in Brazil. Another existing option is to convert a conventional gasoline-powered to allow the alternative use of CNG. Pakistan, Argentina, Brazil, Iran, India, Italy, and China have the largest fleets of natural gas vehicles in the world.|$|E

40|$|Government {{policies}} increasingly promote ethanol {{and other}} biofuels for security, air quality, and climate benefits. One chapter of this dissertation develops {{a model that}} links the distribution of preferences for ethanol to aggregate price responses and then estimates the model using data from {{a large number of}} retail ethanol stations. Ethanol demand is sensitive to relative fuel prices with a mean elasticity 2. 5 [...] 3. 0. The estimates imply that preferences for ethanol are heterogeneous, rather than homogeneous, as previous literature assumes. Accounting for this heterogeneity cuts the estimated cost of a minimum market share standard for ethanol in half, because households with strong preferences do not require large subsidies to choose ethanol over gasoline. Similar intuition likely applies for policies designed to promote other "green" substitutes, such as electricity from renewable sources. Even so, the cost of the ethanol standard exceeds benefits by a wide margin, implying that the policy is harmful. Researchers should focus on marginal households when assessing the impact of policy, because assuming mean preferences can generate misleading results. Another chapter of this dissertation analyzes the market for <b>flexible-fuel</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulations feature a "loophole" that credits gasoline-ethanol <b>flexible-fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> with far better mileage than they actually achieve. Empirical evidence shows that firms affected by CAFE standards produce <b>flexible-fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> to exploit this loophole and that marginal consumers do not value flexible-fuel capacity. Under these and other conditions an automaker will equate the marginal cost of improving mileage using <b>flexible-fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> with the marginal cost of improving mileage through other means. This insight implies that one can infer the marginal cost of complying with CAFE standards for automakers that produce <b>flexible-fuel</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Based on this approach, the estimated cost of tightening CAFE standards by one mile per gallon is at most $ 10 [...] $ 20 in lost profit per vehicle for domestic automakers, assuming incremental production costs of $ 100 [...] $ 200 for <b>flexible-fuel</b> <b>vehicles.</b> These are valuable estimates for economists and regulators, as automakers may overstate costs to avoid tighter standards...|$|R

25|$|As {{an answer}} to the lack of {{refueling}} infrastructure, Ford began development of a <b>flexible-fuel</b> <b>vehicle</b> in 1982, and between 1985 and 1992, 705 experimental FFVs were built and delivered to California and Canada, including the 1.6L Ford Escort, the 3.0L Taurus, and the 5.0L LTD Crown Victoria. These vehicles could operate on either gasoline or methanol with only one fuel system. Legislation was passed to encourage the US auto industry to begin production, which started in 1993 for the M85 FFVs at Ford. In 1996, a new FFV Ford Taurus was developed, with models fully capable of running on either methanol or ethanol blended with gasoline. This ethanol version of the Taurus became the first commercial production of an E85 FFV. The momentum of the FFV production programs at the American car companies continued, although {{by the end of the}} 1990s, the emphasis shifted to the FFV E85 version, as it is today. Ethanol was preferred over methanol because there is a large support from the farming community, and thanks to the government's incentive programs and corn-based ethanol subsidies. Support for ethanol also comes from the fact that it is a biomass fuel, which addresses climate change concerns and greenhouse gas emissions, though nowadays these benefits are questioned and depend on the feedstock used for ethanol production and their indirect land use change impacts.|$|E
500|$|Multifuel {{vehicles}} {{are capable of}} operating with more than two fuels. In 2004 GM do Brasil introduced the Chevrolet Astra 2.0 with a [...] "MultiPower" [...] engine built on flex fuel technology developed by Bosch of Brazil, and capable of using CNG, ethanol and gasoline (E20-E25 blend) as fuel. This automobile was aimed at the taxicab market and the switch among fuels is done manually. In 2006 Fiat introduced the Fiat Siena Tetra fuel, a four-fuel car developed under Magneti Marelli of Fiat Brazil. This automobile can run as a flex-fuel on 100% ethanol (E100); or on E-20 to E25, Brazil's normal ethanol gasoline blend; on pure gasoline (though no longer available in Brazil since 1993, it is still used in neighboring countries); or just on natural gas. The Siena Tetrafuel was engineered to switch from any gasoline-ethanol blend to CNG automatically, depending on the power required by road conditions. Another existing option is to retrofit an ethanol <b>flexible-fuel</b> <b>vehicle</b> to add a natural gas tank and the corresponding injection system. This option is popular among taxicab owners in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, allowing users to choose among three fuels (E25, E100 and CNG) according to current market prices at the pump. Vehicles with this adaptation are known in Brazil as [...] "tri-fuel" [...] cars.|$|E

40|$|Developing {{fuels and}} {{vehicles}} that reduce our reliance {{on fossil fuels}} has become a priority due {{to the threat of}} global climate change and desire for reduced dependence on oil imports. <b>Flexible-fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> that can run on ethanol/gasoline blends of up to 85 % ethanol and hybrid electric vehicles present two such opportunities. While production of both <b>flexible-fuel</b> and hybrid <b>vehicles</b> is increasing, there is still a great deal of uncertainty about how consumers will respond to these products. To address this uncertainty, data was collected through an online survey of automobile owners that asked respondents how likely they were to choose either a <b>flexible-fuel</b> or hybrid <b>vehicle</b> as their next vehicle. A bivariate probit model was used to jointly analyze responses to these two questions.
