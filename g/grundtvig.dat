5|$|The {{technique}} of carte de visite photography {{was brought to}} Denmark by Rudolph Striegler in 1860. It spread rapidly and by the 1870s provided a cheap and attractive alternative to portrait painting for photographers such as Ludvig <b>Grundtvig</b> (1836–1901) and Adolph Lønborg (1835–1916) in Copenhagen, and Heinrich Tønnies (1856–1903) who opened a studio in Aalborg.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1850s, Svend <b>Grundtvig</b> initiated a systematic recording of Danish folklore - the stories were told and written down in every little village in Denmark – but Bournonville did not credit <b>Grundtvig</b> as his source of inspiration, even though today <b>Grundtvig</b> is probably considered to be the person who made the most effort to preserve the wealth of Danish national folk tradition. Bournonville found his inspiration in a collection of national Danish songs (Nationalmelodier) published by the philologist R. Nyerup and the composer A.P. Berggren in J.M. Thiele's collection of Danish folk legends (Danske Folkesagn) published in four volumes between 1818 and 1823. Bournonville also found inspiration in the tales collected by the Grimm brothers in Germany.|$|E

25|$|Franz Böhme's {{theory that}} the knight was {{originally}} a nix, or neck, a water spirit found in the folklore of Germanic people - Child seems to have accepted this idea at first but dropped it after <b>Grundtvig</b> and others asked how such a creature could be killed by drowning.|$|E
25|$|When a {{prolonged}} agricultural crisis and economic slump after the Napoleonic Wars threatened to cripple the entire educational reform programme, {{the government had}} to resort to a distressingly mechanical method of education, the so-called Bell-Lancaster method imported from the industrial north of England, which reduced the number of teachers by a drastic simplification of the curriculum to enable preposterously large numbers of pupils to be taught by a single individual. After some years, this method provoked increasing opposition from parents, who wanted more liberal and inspiring forms of education. Their demands received vigorous support from the poet-clergyman N. F. S. <b>Grundtvig,</b> who exercised a powerful influence on the development of Danish schools. <b>Grundtvig</b> wanted to reduce the task of children's schools to no more than the teaching of reading, writing and arithmetic in order to make room, either at home or at school, for a liberal narrative education that would build on the natural potential for development inherent in the child's mind.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1800s Dannevirke was adopted {{as the title}} of several Danish {{nationalist}} journals dealing specifically with the question of Danish autonomy vis-à-vis Germany, the most notable of these being published by N. F. S. <b>Grundtvig</b> in 1816–19. In earlier times, the Danevirke had indeed defined a cultural and linguistic border between Danish and German fiefdoms, but the cultural and linguistic frontiers had gradually moved north, and by the 19th century territory as far north as Flensburg was predominantly German-speaking, but remained part of Denmark.|$|E

25|$|Brandes {{stands as}} one of the most {{influential}} inspirations of Danish culture, an equal of Holberg, <b>Grundtvig</b> and Ansgar. Among his supporters, Brandes' work was seen as a liberator from repressive norms, authority and hypocrisy, and he served as an inspiration for many contemporary writers. On the other hand, conservative circles condemned him as an immoral, unpatriotic and subversive blasphemer; as he became the lynchpin of criticism against modernity in its entirety. At the same time, some socialists criticized his elitist attitudes, while some feminists have regarded his attitude of sexual equality as being inconsequential.|$|E
25|$|Danish {{philosophy}} {{has a long}} tradition as part of Western philosophy. Perhaps the most influential Danish philosopher was Søren Kierkegaard, the creator of Christian existentialism. Kierkegaard had a few Danish followers, including Harald Høffding, who later in his life moved on to join the movement of positivism. Among Kierkegaard's other followers include Jean-Paul Sartre who was impressed with Kierkegaard's views on the individual, and Rollo May, who helped create humanistic psychology. Another Danish philosopher of note is <b>Grundtvig,</b> whose philosophy gave rise to a new form of non-aggressive nationalism in Denmark, and who is also influential for his theological and historical works.|$|E

S. <b>Grundtvig,</b> and although he had already started to paint, Asger enrolled in the Vinthers Seminarium, a teacher training college in Silkeborg where he paid particular attention to a course in 19th century Scandinavian thought. Also at about this time Jorn became the subject of a number of oil paintings by the painter Martin Kaalund-Jørgensen, which encouraged Jorn to try his hand in this medium.|$|E

500|$|On September 8, 1872, two Danish pioneer pastors, Adam Dan and Rasmus Andersen, {{established}} a small organization in Neenah, Wisconsin, which {{later became the}} Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. At one of the churches' conventions in Clinton, Iowa, in 1884, the Danish farmer Rasmus Hansen of Elk Horn, Iowa, suggested that [...] "the Danish Church should help all the families living around in cities, who would prefer living in the countryside, where they could find a fitting spot for a Danish colony." [...] A committee was appointed {{for the purpose of}} finding a piece of land for the scattered Danish immigrants to settle. The committee consisted of the Grundtvigian Evangelical-Lutheran pastors F.L. <b>Grundtvig</b> (the son of N. F. S. <b>Grundtvig),</b> Kristian Anker, Rasmus Hansen, Jens C. Kjær, and C.Bruhn. This committee soon made arrangements with Winona and the St.Peter Railroad Company to purchase [...] of land in the southeastern part of Lincoln County, Minnesota. An agreement with the land agent, A.Bojsen, stipulated that for three years this land was to be sold only to Danish people. The land was rolling prairie by the hills of Buffalo Ridge, just south of the community of Tyler, Minnesota. By June27, 1885, seventy settlers from various states, towns, and communities had made the area their home.|$|E
500|$|Grundtvig's Church in Bispebjerg, Copenhagen, {{is named}} after the Danish philosopher and pastor Nikolai <b>Grundtvig,</b> remembered by most Danes for his resounding hymns, now an {{integral}} part of the national culture. As a result of its unusual appearance, it is Denmark's most famous expressionist church. Designed by Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint, it relied heavily on Scandinavian brick gothic traditions, especially Danish village churches with stepped gables. Jensen-Klint combined the modern geometric forms of Brick Expressionism with the classical vertical of Gothic architecture. [...] Construction began in 1921 but was only completed by his son Kaare Klint in 1940 after Jensen-Klint's death. The most striking feature of the building is its west facade, reminiscent of a westwork or of the exterior of a church organ.|$|E
500|$|Over the years, Nielsen {{wrote the}} music for over 290 songs and hymns, most of them for verses and poems by {{well-known}} Danish authors such as N. F. S. <b>Grundtvig,</b> Ingemann, Poul Martin Møller, Adam Oehlenschläger and Jeppe Aakjær. In Denmark, {{many of them are}} still popular today both with adults and children. They are regarded as [...] "the most representative part of the country's most representative composer's output". In 1906, Nielsen had explained the significance of such songs to his countrymen:With certain melodic inflections we Danes unavoidably think of the poems of, for example, Ingemann, Christian Winther or Drachmann, and we often seem to perceive the smell of Danish landscapes and rural images in our songs and music. But {{it is also clear that}} a foreigner, who knows neither our countryside, nor our painters, our poets, or our history in the same intimate way as we do ourselves, will be completely unable to grasp what it is that brings us to hear and tremble with sympathetic understanding.|$|E

500|$|The pioneer {{settlers}} {{were all}} Grundtvigians; a faction within the Danish National Church. The Grundtvigians represented a nationalistic and liberal religious tradition, in staunch contrast to pietists and fundamentalists in the Church Association for the Inner Mission in Denmark. Grundtvigians believed in celebrating life, but they lived for the present, and were often nicknamed [...] "Happy Danes". While salvation was {{the gift of}} Christianity, being saved was not a focus. The Bible was the Holy Book, but {{was not to be}} taken literally, and the Apostles' Creed rather than the Bible was their source of Christianity. Grundtvigians were also nationalists who wanted to [...] "rewaken the Danes in appreciation of their identity", and its founder, Nikolaj Frederik Severin <b>Grundtvig,</b> is quoted for his writing: [...] "first a Dane and then a Christian" [...] in 1848. The Grundtvigians stressed four elects of a [...] "true people": a common land, a common language, a common history and forefathers, and common culture through songs, folk dancing, language, cuisine, etc. Grundtvigians established Danebod to [...] "save the Danes from total Americanization", and the colony's only written and spoken language remained Danish for several decades after its establishment. On Sunday, June28, 1885, the pioneers arranged a festival to celebrate the new colony. The population grew rapidly in the early 1890s, and by the year 1895, 222 people lived in the Danish Colony of Danebod.|$|E

2500|$|Changes {{did occur}} in the {{administration}} of the Church and these changes were linked to Kierkegaard's writings. The Church noted that dissent was [...] "something foreign to the national mind". On 5 April 1855 the Church enacted new policies: [...] "every member of a congregation is free to attend the ministry of any clergyman, and is not, as formerly, bound to the one whose parishioner he is". In March 1857, compulsory infant baptism was abolished. Debates sprang up over the King's position {{as the head of the}} Church and over whether to adopt a constitution. <b>Grundtvig</b> objected to having any written rules. Immediately following this announcement the [...] "agitation occasioned by Kierkegaard" [...] was mentioned. Kierkegaard was accused of Weigelianism and Darbyism, but the article continued to say, [...] "One great truth has been made prominent, viz (namely): That there exists a worldly-minded clergy; that many things in the Church are rotten; that all need daily repentance; that one must never be contented with the existing state of either the Church or her pastors." ...|$|E
