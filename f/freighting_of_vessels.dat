40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the relative risks involved in owning and operating tanker <b>vessels</b> <b>of</b> different sizes in world spot and time-charter (TC) markets. Cointegrating Error Correction ARCH models are used to model spot and TC rates for each ship size and the associated time varying risks involved. The advantage of using this class of models for analysis is that the error correction term can capture the short-run dynamic behaviour of rates, while the estimation of time varying volatilities allows for the explicit comparison of risks at each point in time. Indeed, levels and patterns <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> risk are shown to vary over time. Broadly, comparison of these risks across markets point to TC rates having lower volatilities in comparison to the spot rates, and <b>freight</b> rates <b>of</b> larger <b>vessels</b> having higher volatilities compared to the <b>freight</b> volatilities <b>of</b> smaller <b>vessels.</b> Thus, for risk averse owners, wishing to reduce risks, results suggest operating tanker ships in TC rather than spot markets, and using smaller size vessels to diversify the higher risks involved in owning and operating larger size vessels.

40|$|The world bulk {{shipping}} {{market has been}} in a peak period since 2003, and this has lasted an incredibly long time considering that the markets are much more complex than before. This paper investigates the characteristics of volatility in dry bulk <b>freight</b> rates <b>of</b> different <b>vessel</b> sizes (capesize, panamax and handysize). The daily returns <b>of</b> <b>freight</b> rate indices <b>of</b> three different types <b>of</b> bulk <b>vessel</b> in the sample period have been examined. The sample period ran from 1 March 1999 to 23 December 2005, and applying the GARCH (generalized auto regressive conditional heteroskedasticity) model showed that the shocks will not decrease but have the tendency to strengthen for all the daily return series. Further, external shocks on the market have a different magnitude of influence on volatility in different types <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> due to their distinct flexibility. To examine the asymmetric characters of daily return volatility in different {{bulk shipping}} sectors and different market conditions, the sample was divided into two periods: one is from 1 March 1999 to 31 December 2002, the other is from 1 January 2003 to 23 December 2005; the EGARCH (exponential generalized auto regressive conditional heteroskedasticity) model was then applied to investigate the asymmetric impact between past innovations and current volatility. The results show that the asymmetric characters are distinct for different vessel size segments and different market conditions. The reasons for the results are discussed and it is considered that the main reasons may be the different flexibility and different commodity transport on different routes. The results from this investigation will be useful for the operators and investors in the dry bulk shipping market to increase profitability and reduce investment risk...|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} 17th century Rùm's {{status as a}} hunting reserve went into decline and {{population}} numbers started to rise.

The nearby smaller island of Muck was valued for land rental the same as the whole of Rùm at this time, again indicating the poverty of agriculture on Rùm. The growing population of Rùm's demands on the land led to the extermination of the native red deer (Cervus elaphus) during the latter half of the 18th century.|$|R
