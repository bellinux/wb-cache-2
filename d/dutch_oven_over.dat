These changes {{included}} a shallower pot, legs to hold the oven above the coals, and a lid flange to keep the coals on the lid {{and out of the}} food. Paul Revere is credited with the design of the flat lid with a ridge for holding coals as well as the addition of legs to the pots.|$|R

25|$|Westward bound {{settlers}} took <b>Dutch</b> <b>ovens</b> with them. A <b>Dutch</b> <b>oven</b> {{was among}} the gear Lewis and Clark carried when they explored the great American Northwest in 1804–1806. Mormon pioneers who settled the American West also took along their <b>Dutch</b> <b>ovens.</b> In fact, a statue raised to honor the Mormon handcart companies who entered Utah’s Salt Lake Valley in the 1850s proudly displays a <b>Dutch</b> <b>oven</b> hanging {{from the front of}} the handcart.

2500|$|A <b>Dutch</b> <b>oven</b> is a {{thick-walled}} cooking {{pot with}} a tight-fitting lid. <b>Dutch</b> <b>ovens</b> are usually made of seasoned cast iron, however some <b>Dutch</b> <b>ovens</b> are instead made of cast aluminium, or are ceramic. Some metal varieties are enameled {{rather than being}} seasoned. <b>Dutch</b> <b>ovens</b> {{have been used as}} cooking vessels for hundreds of years. They are called casserole dishes in English speaking countries other than the United States ("casserole" [...] means [...] "pot" [...] in French), and cocottes in French. They are similar to both the Japanese tetsunabe and the Sač, a traditional Balkan cast-iron oven, and are related to the South African Potjie and the Australian Bedourie oven.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>Dutch</b> <b>oven,</b> {{was another}} popular method of baking while using {{an open fire}} or a fire in a hearth. The <b>Dutch</b> <b>oven,</b> unlike the tin kitchen, is made of iron, and would collect and {{concentrate}} the heat of coals placed beneath {{and on top of}} the oven, while preventing the coals from direct contact with the food, and isolating smoke from the fire from the baking food.|$|R
25|$|A camping, cowboy, or chuckwagon <b>Dutch</b> <b>oven</b> {{has three}} legs, a wire bail handle, and a {{slightly}} concave, rimmed lid so that coals from the cooking fire can be placed on top as well as below.

50|$|<b>Dutch</b> <b>Oven</b> was foaled in 1879 at Lord Falmouth Mereworth Castle Stud in Maidstone, Kent.

However, by the time Lord Falmouth bought her {{after the death of}} Lord Ailesbury, she had developed into a roarer and was consequently judged to be a poor breeding prospect.
