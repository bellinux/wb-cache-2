40|$|A {{hot cell}} {{installation}} for {{the handling of}} highly radioactive material may comprise {{a dozen or more}} interconnected high density concrete vaults, the concrete vault walls having a thickness of approximately three feet. Typically, hot cells are constructed in rows so as to share as many shielding walls as possible. A typical overall length of a row of cells might be 70 yards. A secondary mechanism exists for placing certain objects into a cell. A typical hot cell has been constructed with 8 inch diameter holes through the exterior shielded walls in the vicinity of, and usually above, the viewing windows. It became evident that if the hot cell plugs could be removed and replaced conveniently significant savings in time and personnel exposure could be realized by using these 8 inch holes as entry ports. Fifteen inch cylindrical steel plugs with a diameter of eight inches weigh about two hundred pounds. The shield plug swing mechanism comprises a steel shielding plug mounted on a retraction device that enables the plug to be pulled out of the wall and supports the weight of the pulled out plug. The retraction device is mounted on a hinge, which allows the plug to be swung out of the way so that an operator can insert material into or remove it from the interior of the hot cell and then replace the plug quickly. The <b>hinge</b> <b>mounting</b> transmits the load of the retracted plug to the concrete wall...|$|E

40|$|The maximum {{deformation}} and {{the stress}} state of furniture doors with different configurations of hinges {{were analyzed using}} finite element analysis with the ultimate purpose of optimizing the hinge configuration.

40|$|For ground {{testing of}} {{controlled}} flexible space structures an active suspension design is proposed to eliminate dynamic reaction {{forces from the}} suspension cables. Thus, supporting only the constant weight forces at the hinges, an approximative dynamic g-compensation is achieved. The principle suspension actuator design is based upon apassive spring bias weight support, augmented by an electrodynamic actuator which eliminates the spring restraint forces about equilibrium. Moving mass reaction forces are compensated for by feedback of a <b>hinge</b> <b>mounted</b> dynamic force sensor output. The salient feature of the voice-coil type actuator is the on- line compensation of the inherent non-linear force-displacement characteristic by a high-speed signal processor. Due to the simple mechanical design the actuator can be easily adapted with respect to range and output force level. Moreover the overall cost is considerably reduced by elimination of complex mechanical adjustment and calibration procedures and by utilization of respective software control instead...|$|R

The Royal Aircraft Factory and National Physical Laboratory in the United Kingdom tested flaps in 1913 and 1914, but these were never installed in an actual aircraft. In 1916, the Fairey Aviation Company made a number of improvements to a Sopwith Baby they were rebuilding, including their Patent Camber Changing Gear, making the Fairey Hamble Baby as they renamed it, the first aircraft to fly with flaps. These were full span plain flaps which incorporated ailerons, making it also the first instance of flaperons. Fairey were not alone however, as Breguet soon incorporated automatic flaps into the lower wing of their Breguet 14 reconnaissance/bomber in 1917. Due to the greater efficiency of other flap types, the plain flap is normally only used where simplicity is required.|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} parametric investigation of whirl flutter are presented for a model consisting of a windmilling propeller-rotor, or proprotor, having blades with offset flapping <b>hinges</b> <b>mounted</b> on a rigid pylon with flexibility in pitch and yaw. The investigation was motivated {{by the need to}} establish a large data base from which to assess the predictability of whirl flutter for a proprotor since some question has been raised as to whether flutter in the forward whirl mode could be predicted with confidence. To provide the necessary data base, the parametric study included variation in the pylon pitch and yaw stiffnesses, flapping hinge offset, and blade kinematic pitch-flap coupling over a large range of advance ratios. Cases of forward whirl flutter and of backward whirl flutter are documented. Measured whirl flutter characteristics were shown to be in good agreement with predictions from two different linear stability analyses which employed simple, two dimensional, quasi-steady aerodynamics for the blade loading. On the basis of these results, it appears that proprotor whirl flutter, both forward and backward, can be predicted...|$|R
50|$|The MG 34s were fitted into {{specially}} designed <b>hinged</b> <b>mounts</b> {{for ease of}} use. The gunner could quickly withdraw his MG34 from one loophole and push it along a rail to another.

In addition, the turret had a periscope and a searchlight, all of which could be operated from the turret. Each MG 34 fired a 7.92mm round at a fire rate in excess of 1000 rounds per minute to a range of approximately 1500 yards. The design of the machine gun mounts permitted the gun crew easily to change the gun's barrel; the gunner would stop firing, lift the hinged scope out of position, open up the gun, slide out the barrel and insert a new one. For a well trained crew this would only take seconds. The mounting also incorporated a chute which emptied spent casings into bags below.|$|R
