5|$|Eaton and {{his wife}} lived comfortably in {{retirement}} in Washington, D.C. He resumed his law practice, and he and is wife returned to Franklin during the summers. Eaton chose not to join any church, but figured prominently in Washington social circles. He was President of the Washington Bar Association. Eaton {{and his wife}} were reported to have <b>drank</b> <b>too</b> much, and he was criticized for taking up a legal case against Amos Kendall, a staunch Jacksonian who had defended the Eatons' conduct during the Petticoat affair. Eaton died in Washington on November 17, 1856 at age 66. His funeral was conducted at his residence. Eaton was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington.|$|E
5|$|The Achaeans were {{demoralized}} by this battle; Aratus {{declined the}} generalship, and when both Athens and the Aetolian League turned down their appeals, they sued Cleomenes for peace. Initially, Cleomenes advanced only minor requests, {{but as the}} talks continued, his demands became greater and he eventually insisted that leadership of the League be surrendered to him. In exchange, {{he would return to}} the Achaeans the prisoners and strongholds he had seized. The Achaeans invited Cleomenes to Lerna, where they were holding council. While marching there, Cleomenes <b>drank</b> <b>too</b> much water, which caused him to lose his voice and cough up blood—a situation that forced him to return to Sparta.|$|E
5|$|David's {{private life}} was less felicitous. In April 1963 her affair with Higgins {{came to an}} end when he remarried. For a period she <b>drank</b> <b>too</b> much brandy and resorted too often to {{sleeping}} pills. Probably {{as a result of these}} factors and overwork, in 1963, when she was 49, David suffered a cerebral haemorrhage. She kept the news of the event within her close circle of friends—none of the editors of the publications she worked for were aware of the collapse—as she did not want her reputation as a hard worker to be damaged. She recovered, but her confidence was badly shaken and her sense of taste was temporarily affected; for a period she could not taste salt, or the effect salt had on what she was cooking, but her sense of smell of frying onions was so enhanced as to be unpleasant for her.|$|E

5|$|Governor Violante Beatrice and the Dowager Electress, {{following}} the former's sojourn in Rome, {{in spite of}} their mutual dislike of each other, attempted to ameliorate Gian Gastone's decadent public image together. Violante Beatrice organised banquets to remove him from the sway of the Ruspanti. His behaviour at these sent guests running for their carriages: he vomited into his napkin, wiped his mouth with his peri-wig and told rude jokes. These parties ceased when Violante Beatrice died, in 1731; Gian Gastone was devastated by the loss of his beloved sister-in-law. Rumours abounded that the Grand Duke had died, as the public never saw him. To discredit these, the Dowager Electress induced Gian Gastone to make a public appearance—his final one—on Saint John the Baptist's day of 1729. An alcoholic, Gian Gastone <b>drank</b> <b>too</b> much before the ceremony and vomited repeatedly throughout; he had to be carried unconscious back to the Palazzo Pitti, the royal palace, on a litter. A sprained ankle incurred in July 1729 left the Grand Duke bed-ridden for—barring two occasions—the rest of his life.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeated}} army suffered greatly, {{not only}} from the Byzantine pursuit, but also due to lack of water: before the battle, Kardarigan had ordered the water supplies poured to the ground, trying to make his men fight harder to break through the Byzantine army and reach the Arzamon. In addition, the surviving Persians were refused entry into Dara since, according to Simocatta, Persian custom forbade entrance to fugitives. Simocatta also narrates that many Persians died of thirst or from water poisoning when they <b>drank</b> <b>too</b> much water from wells after their ordeal. Kardarigan himself had managed to find refuge on a nearby hilltop with a small detachment and withstood several Byzantine attacks. Finally, after three or four days, the Byzantines, not aware that the enemy commander was there, abandoned the effort. Kardarigan thus escaped, although his men suffered further casualties in the process, up to a thousand according to Simocatta, from Byzantine patrols.|$|E

25|$|An unsympathetic {{person might}} {{characterize}} Melville as a failed writer who held a low-level government job, <b>drank</b> <b>too</b> much, heckled his wife unmercifully about the housework, beat her occasionally, {{and drove the}} children to distraction with his unpredictable behavior. A sympathetic observer might characterize him as an underappreciated genius, a visionary, an iconoclastic thinker, a sensitive, orphaned American idealist, and {{a victim of a}} crude, materialistic society that ate artists and visionaries alive and spat out their bones. He was both, and more.|$|E
25|$|Hoping {{to clear}} his head and develop new ideas for songs, Armstrong {{traveled}} to New York City alone for a few weeks, renting a small apartment in the East Village of Manhattan. He spent much of this time taking long walks and participating in jam sessions {{in the basement of}} Hi-Fi, a bar in Manhattan. However, the friends he made during this time <b>drank</b> <b>too</b> much for his liking, which was the catalyst for Armstrong's return to the Bay Area. After returning home, Armstrong was arrested on DUI charges on January 5, 2003, and released on $1,200 bail.|$|E
25|$|Tom Emmett {{then took}} over as Captain, but the {{following}} two seasons brought mixed results as the team displayed inconsistency, often losing to teams they should comfortably have beaten. Derek Hodgson, in his official county history, suggests a lack of discipline in the team throughout these years was to blame; contemporary reports suggested the team <b>drank</b> <b>too</b> much alcohol to be effective. The players also suffered from public attention, receiving generous hospitality at times which impacted on their performances. In these seasons, the team often began well only to lose form {{later in the season}} and the Yorkshire committee was reluctant to replace the experienced cricketers with younger players. However, off the field, Yorkshire became increasingly successful, and the profits made by the club paid for improvements to be made to the Bramall Lane Ground and increased player wages through the introduction of travelling expenses and talent money where good performances were financially rewarded. An influx of what proved to be effective new players saw Yorkshire finish second to Lancashire in the unofficial Championship for 1881, but more significant was the debut for the county of Lord Hawke, then aged 21.|$|E

His friend Herbie Worthington explained: [...] "You wouldn't expect {{somebody}} {{with that kind of}} love to be that violent... He just couldn't drink... he simply turned into a bastard". According to journalist and friend Sharon Lawrence, Hendrix [...] "admitted he could not handle hard liquor, which set off a bottled-up anger, a destructive fury he almost never displayed otherwise".|$|E
500|$|In September 2012, a British Comedy Society blue plaque, {{to commemorate}} Chapman, was {{unveiled}} at The Angel pub in Highgate, North London, by Jones, Palin, Barry Cryer, Ray Davies and Carol Cleveland. Palin said, [...] "This was Graham's manor .... Highgate was his patch {{and he should}} be celebrated because he was a very good, brilliant, funny, nice, wise, kind man, who occasionally <b>drank</b> <b>too</b> much."

By 1947, Skelton's musical conductor was David Rose, who {{would go on to}} television with him; he had worked with Rose during his time in the army and wanted Rose to join him on the radio show when it went back on the air.|$|E

[...] Tor's editors also had more time than those of Del Rey and helped [...] "untangle" [...] the complicated plot of Onyx. On writing, Nylund pointed out that [...] "tension is the cornerstone of any good story", and that Ghosts of Onyx would be no different.|$|E
500|$|Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616, {{at the age}} of 52. He {{died within}} a month of signing his will, a {{document}} which he begins by describing himself as being in [...] "perfect health". No extant contemporary source explains how or why he died. Half a century later, John Ward, the vicar of Stratford, wrote in his notebook: [...] "Shakespeare, Drayton, and Ben Jonson had a merry meeting and, it seems, <b>drank</b> <b>too</b> hard, for Shakespeare died of a fever there contracted", not an impossible scenario since Shakespeare knew Jonson and Drayton. Of the tributes from fellow authors, one refers to his relatively sudden death: [...] "We wondered, Shakespeare, that thou went'st so soon/From the world's stage to the grave's tiring room." ...|$|E
500|$|According {{to early}} reports, {{a total of}} 57 people were hospitalized, with 49 dying. The victims were {{described}} as being poor residents of the Novo-Lenino neighborhood in Irkutsk, all {{between the ages of}} 35 and 50. Subsequent reports increased the number affected: first to 55 deaths (with a total of 94 affected), then 62 (with 107 affected), 77 (number of affected not given), and finally down to 74. The other three had <b>drank</b> <b>too</b> much regular (ethyl) alcohol. About a third of them were found in their homes, having died before being able to call for an ambulance. Of the remainder, a problem in attempting to treat them was that fomepizole, a methanol antidote, is not certified for use in Russia and is therefore not available in the country's hospitals. Overall, the victims included a doctor, teachers, nurses, and drivers; the majority were described as holding [...] "steady if low-paying jobs." ...|$|E

500|$|Now {{living in}} Los Angeles, Cher's mother began acting {{while working as}} a waitress. She changed her name to Georgia Holt and played minor roles in films and on {{television}}. Holt also secured acting parts for her daughters as extras on television shows like The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet. Her mother's relationship with Southall ended when Cher was nine years old, but she considers him her father and remembers him as a [...] "good-natured man who turned belligerent when he <b>drank</b> <b>too</b> much". Holt remarried and divorced several more times, and she moved her family around the country (including New York, Texas, and California). They often had little money, and Cher recounted having had to use rubber bands to hold her shoes together. At one point, her mother left Cher at an orphanage for several weeks. Although they met every day, both found the experience traumatic.|$|E
500|$|On January26, 1895, Kinslow {{was traded}} by Brooklyn to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Ad Gumbert. The Red Stockings quickly disputed the deal however, {{claiming}} that they had an earlier agreement with Pittsburgh's manager Connie Mack that would have brought them Gumbert and Buck Weaver in exchange for Billy Merritt. Despite the dispute, the Brooklyn deal went forward, and Kinslow joined the Pirates. With the catching duties being split between Merritt and Joe Sugden, there was little playing time allotted for Kinslow; Kinslow's behavior had become a problem for Mack and the Pirates. Once, he was fined for missing a game due to drinking, and in late May, he was suspended for failing {{to show up for}} a game in Washington, D.C. On June22, he failed to be ready for a road series, and was released from the team for disorderly conduct. Kinslow expressed sorrow and shock over getting released, claiming that while he <b>drank</b> <b>too</b> much, Brooklyn would issue fines for his behavior instead. In 19games played for Pittsburgh, he had a [...]226batting average, Though he had received interest from Cincinnati and the Washington Senators, he claimed that he wanted to take the remainder the year off to be ready for the next season.|$|E
500|$|Pauline and Arthur were {{generally}} {{seen as the}} most stable couple in the show, so Arthur's affair with Christine Hewitt (Lizzie Power) {{came as a shock}} to viewers. The storyline was long-running, beginning early in 1992 with the introduction of lonely divorcee Christine, who employs Arthur to tend to her garden. A romance between Arthur and Christine steadily develops throughout the year, facilitated by Pauline's lengthy absence—she is called abroad to tend to her crippled brother Kenny in early June, and she does not return until late September—in reality, Wendy Richard had to be temporarily written out of EastEnders to allow her to act in Grace and Favour. The build-up to the affair contains many twists and turns, starting with Arthur's rebuff of Christine's advances, then a confrontation between Pauline and Christine, which convinces Pauline of Arthur's innocence and leaves her feeling [...] "strangely sorry for the pathetic, lonely figure, who obviously <b>drank</b> <b>too</b> much". The episode in which Arthur finally gives into temptation and sleeps with Christine aired on Christmas Eve 1992; it was labelled [...] "The Bonk of the Year" [...] by the British press, and was watched by 24.3million viewers. In 2005, it was reported as the eleventh most highly viewed UK television programme of all time.|$|E
