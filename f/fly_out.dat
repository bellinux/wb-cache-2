5|$|The flycatchers {{are small}} birds that <b>fly</b> <b>out</b> from a perch to catch insects {{in the air}} or from the ground. There are about 120 species worldwide, 11 {{of which have been}} {{recorded}} in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|Cueto walked Murphy {{with two}} outs in the ninth before getting Cespedes to <b>fly</b> <b>out</b> to right to finish the {{complete}} game, becoming the first AL pitcher to accomplish this feat in the World Series since Jack Morris in Game 7 of the 1991 World Series, as the Royals defeated the Mets and took a two games to zero lead in the series. Cueto became the first AL pitcher since Jim Lonborg in the 1967 World Series to throw a World Series complete game while allowing two hits or fewer.|$|E
5|$|In early August 1942, a small {{detachment}} of an American fighter control squadron had been stationed on Goodenough Island to provide advance {{warning to the}} Australian fighters based at Milne Bay. On 7 August, five Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) P-40 Kittyhawks of No. 76 Squadron made forced landings on the grassy plains. One crashed on landing {{and had to be}} written off, but after makeshift airstrips were cut through the grass, the remaining four were able to <b>fly</b> <b>out</b> again.|$|E

5|$|Red Sox closer Foulke came in {{to pitch}} {{the bottom of the}} ninth. Pujols led off the inning by hitting a single through Foulke's legs and into center field. After Foulke induced Rolen into a <b>fly</b> <b>out</b> and struck out Edmonds, Pujols took second base, but no stolen base due to fielder's indifference. Édgar Rentería then hit a ground ball that bounced back to Foulke on the mound. Foulke threw it underhand to Doug Mientkiewicz at first base to end the game, and secure the series.|$|E
5|$|The 1993 season saw long-time Red Sox fan {{favorite}} Wade Boggs defect to the Yankees after eleven {{seasons with}} Boston. Later in September 1993, the Yankees defeated Boston at Yankee Stadium via a last-moment reprieve. Trailing 3–1, Mike Stanley's apparent <b>fly</b> <b>out</b> {{with two outs}} in the ninth was nullified by a fan running onto the field prior to the pitch being thrown. The umpire had called time and when play resumed, Stanley singled. The Yankees would rally to score three runs and win on a Mattingly single.|$|E
5|$|Following the C-5 crash, {{and with}} the cause still unknown, the C-5 fleet was {{grounded}} and the MAC airlift was reduced to using C-141s and C-130s; rather than loading as many evacuees as possible, each evacuee required a seat and a seatbelt, {{reducing the number of}} passengers that could be carried on each flight. Each C-141 would carry 94 passengers while each C-130 would carry 75, although these restrictions were relaxed, and then ignored altogether as the pace of the evacuation quickened. Armed guards were also present on each flight to prevent the possibility of hijacking. American commercial and contract carriers continued to <b>fly</b> <b>out</b> of Tan Son Nhut, but with decreasing frequency. In addition, military aircraft from Australia, Indonesia, Iran, Poland, UK, France, and other countries flew in to evacuate their embassy personnel.|$|E

5|$|Like ale, aloviti men led hail-producing and {{thunderstorm}} clouds: {{when the}} skies darkened, {{such a man}} would fall into a trance, and his spirit would <b>fly</b> <b>out</b> of his body toward the clouds as if his spirit were an ala herself. There was, however, a significant difference– he never led the clouds over the fields of his own village; the damage was done to the neighboring villages. In this respect, aloviti men are equivalent to zduhaći. Besides leading clouds away, an aloviti man could also fight against ale to protect his village. Children, too, could be aloviti, and they fought ale using plough beams. In these fights they were helped by the Aesculapian snake (smuk in Serbian), {{and for this reason}} people would not hurt these snakes.|$|E
5|$|On July 6, Davis {{was elected}} to start the 2013 All-Star Game, his first ever appearance. He was the leading vote-getter with 8,272,243 votes. Davis was also chosen to {{participate}} in the Home Run Derby for the first time, by American League captain Robinson Canó. Davis advanced to the second round and hit a total of 12 home runs. However, a blister broke on his hand, leaving him unable to hit enough homers to advance to the third and final round. At the All-Star Game the next night, July 16, 2013, Davis went 1-3, with a <b>fly</b> <b>out,</b> a single and a strikeout. Davis's single against Patrick Corbin advanced Miguel Cabrera to third, where he would score the game's first run on José Bautista's sacrifice fly.|$|E
5|$|That even a dead ala is bad {{is seen in}} {{the legend}} {{explaining}} the origin of the Golubatz fly (Simulium colombaschense), a species of bloodsucking black fly (of the genus Simulium) that can be lethal to livestock. The legend, recorded in the Požarevac District in the 19th century by Vuk Karadžić, tells how a Serbian man, after a chase, caught and wounded an ala, but she broke away and fled into a cave near Golubac (a town in the district), where she died of the wounds. Ever since, her body has bred the Golubatz flies, and in late spring, they <b>fly</b> <b>out</b> of the cave in a big swarm, spreading as far as Šumadija. People walled up the cave’s opening once, but when the time came for the flies to swarm, the wall shattered.|$|E

5|$|The B-70 {{was planned}} to use a high-speed, high-altitude bombing {{approach}} that followed a trend of bombers flying progressively faster and higher {{since the start of}} manned bomber use. Through that same period, only two weapons proved effective against bombers: fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery (AAA). Flying higher and faster made it more difficult for both; higher speeds allowed the bomber to <b>fly</b> <b>out</b> of range of the weapons more quickly, while higher altitudes increased the time needed for fighters to climb to the bombers, and greatly increased the size of the AAA weapons needed to reach those altitudes.|$|E
5|$|The Cape sparrow is social, {{lives in}} flocks, and usually breeds in colonies. Away from settled areas it {{spends much of}} the year {{wandering}} nomadically, in flocks of up to 200 birds. In cultivated and built up areas, smaller flocks form where food is provided for livestock or birds. In such places, it associates with other seed-eating birds, such as the house sparrow, the Cape weaver, and weavers of the genus Euplectes. Birds from urban areas form large flocks seasonally and <b>fly</b> <b>out</b> to the nearby countryside to feed on ripening grain, returning at night to roost.|$|E
5|$|The Celtics {{were unable}} to repeat their title in 1987 despite several {{dramatic}} playoff victories. Johnson played strong defense again, earning yet another appearance on the All-Defensive First Team, and the Celtics embarked on a nail-biting playoff campaign. In the 1987 Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Celtics split the first six games against the Milwaukee Bucks. In the deciding Game 7, which the Celtics won, Johnson had a spectacular play with 1:30 left in the game: a Celtics ball threatened to <b>fly</b> <b>out</b> of bounds, but Johnson dived for it and whipped it backwards in mid-air against Bucks center and former Sonics teammate Jack Sikma. The ball bounced off Sikma before going out of bounds, and the Celtics maintained possession.|$|E

5|$|The need to test Zeus against targets flying {{realistic}} ICBM profiles {{presented a}} problem. While White Sands was fine for testing the basic missile and guidance systems, {{it was too}} small to test Zeus at its maximum range. Such testing began at Point Mugu in California. where the Zeus missiles could <b>fly</b> <b>out</b> over the Pacific. Consideration was given to using Point Mugu to launch against ICBMs flying from Cape Canaveral, but range safety requirements placed limits on the potential tests. The Atlantic Test Range, to the northeast of Canaveral, had a high population density and little land available for building accurate downrange tracking stations, Ascension being the only suitable location.|$|E
5|$|While {{on their}} way to buy jawbreakers at the candy store, the Eds are stopped by Sarah who claims to have found her doll under her bed. Double D then confesses that he {{recently}} found his magnifying glass as well, proving that there never actually was a serial toucher. Despite this revelation, the Eds still decide to spend the money, without freeing Jonny. However, while they are enjoying their jawbreakers, Sarah rolls the tire in which Jonny is trapped in down a hill, knocking the three over. The jawbreakers <b>fly</b> <b>out</b> of their mouths and roll down the street, leaving the Eds to chase after them into the sunset.|$|E
5|$|Branca {{began the}} game by {{retiring}} the first three batters; Eddie Stanky and Alvin Dark flied out while Don Mueller grounded out. In {{the bottom of the}} first, Carl Furillo grounded out, and Pee Wee Reese hit a single. After Duke Snider flied out, Reese was caught stealing second base to end the inning. In the second inning, Branca retired all three hitters; when the Dodgers came up to bat, Jackie Robinson flied out and Roy Campanella grounded out. Andy Pafko scored the game's first run with a home run to left field to make the score 1–0. After the third out, Willie Mays walked to start the third inning, and after the first out Stanky got the Giants' first hit, a single. After a <b>fly</b> <b>out</b> by Dark, the Giants remained without a run; Hearn retired all three batters {{in the bottom of the}} third to end the inning.|$|E

5|$|On March 5 Quang sent {{one of his}} battalions to Ban Me Thuot in {{a convoy}} of 14 {{vehicles}}. They were ambushed by the North Vietnamese 9th Regiment, 320A Infantry Division at Thuan Man. Eight vehicles were destroyed, while two 150mm artillery guns were captured by the North Vietnamese. The remaining seven vehicles had to turn back, and Quang returned to Ban Me Thuot on a helicopter. On March 7 the North Vietnamese 48th Regiment, 320A Infantry Division, captured Chu Se and Thuan Man, and took 121 soldiers prisoner. On March 9 Phu ordered the 21st Ranger Battalion to <b>fly</b> <b>out</b> from Pleiku to support the 53rd Infantry Regiment {{in their efforts to}} retake Thuan Man. During the early hours of March 9, as the 21st Ranger Battalion and the 53rd Infantry Regiment were repeatedly beaten back in their attempts to retake Thuan Man, the under-strength North Vietnamese 10th Regiment captured Duc Lap and the surrounding areas.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the Cardinals were {{wavering}} between starting Murry Dickson or Harry Brecheen in game two, {{while the}} Dodgers {{were looking to}} use either Higbe, who had pitched in the previous game, or Joe Hatten; the two clubs went with Dickson and Hatten. Hatten began {{the game in the}} top of the first inning by only allowing one hit to Terry Moore. In the bottom of the first, the Dodgers scored the game's first run. After Eddie Stanky struck out, and Dick Whitman flied out, Augie Galan singled. He was brought home by a walk and another single. After Carl Furillo flied out, the first inning ended with a score of 1–0. In the top of the second, the Cardinals responded when Erv Dusak tripled after a Slaughter ground out. Marty Marion hit a sacrifice fly to score Dusak, and after a single by Clyde Kluttz, Dickson tripled to score another run, giving St. Louis a 2–1 lead, before a <b>fly</b> <b>out</b> ended their half of the inning. Dickson walked Bruce Edwards, but retired the next three batters, leaving the score 2–1 at the end of the second inning.|$|E

Air France, Lufthansa, and REAL (of Brazil) {{had a few}} flights per week. Midway {{was running out of}} room and in any case could not handle the 707 and DC-8 jets that appeared in 1959; every Chicago jet flight had to use O'Hare, which had opened to the airlines in 1955. Electras and Viscounts could have continued to <b>fly</b> <b>out</b> of Midway, but O'Hare's capacious new terminal opened in 1962, allowing airlines to consolidate their flights. From July 1962 until United returned in July 1964, Midway's only scheduled airline was Chicago Helicopter. In August 1966 a total of four fixed-wing arrivals were scheduled, all United 727s (United was alone at Midway until early 1968).|$|E
