5|$|Arbitration {{between the}} company and its {{employees}} by the Indiana Public Service Commission resulted in a decision mostly favoring the company. The employees were permitted to unionize, guaranteed wage increases, a minimum monthly salary, and certain <b>days</b> <b>off</b> work. The company, however, was permitted to continue hiring non-union employees and to bar union membership solicitation on the company's property.|$|E
5|$|Before {{creating}} Shaman King, Takei, {{an assistant}} of Nobuhiro Watsuki's Rurouni Kenshin, exchanged {{ideas about the}} series with the other assistants. As a colleague of Watsuki, he worked primarily as a manga assistant, only focusing on his own projects during his <b>days</b> <b>off.</b> He was influenced by street art from hip-hop and rap culture, which is apparent in his manga artwork. For drawing, he used calligraphy inks and pen nibs. When illustrating, he used Copic brand color markers.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Ismael {{produced}} 30foot (9m) waves {{over the}} Gulf of California and coastal waters off of Mexico. The hurricane, which was forecast {{to move more}} slowly, left hundreds of fisherman unprepared due to deficient communications between the boats and harbor authorities. As a result, 52 boats were wrecked, of which 20 sank. 57 fishermen died offshore, with dozens washing ashore as the high tides receded. About 150 fishermen survived the storm by waiting on islands, sandbars, or disabled fishing boats. Navy rescue teams and other fishermen searched for <b>days</b> <b>off</b> the Mexican coast to find victims and survivors from the storm.|$|E
5|$|The promotional {{phase of}} the {{gameplay}} mainly deals with the idol conversing with various other characters and doing events, {{some of which are}} necessary to progress the game. There are also times when the player is given choices that directly affect the idol. Over the course of a conversation, text progression pauses when the player is given multiple responses to choose from. Depending on which choice is made will effect how well or poorly the communication is received, which results in either bad, normal or good memories. A bad memory will decrease an idol's enthusiasm, which is displayed at certain points throughout gameplay by a horizontal bar in the top-left of the lower screen. An idol's enthusiasm ranges from blue to yellow and finally to red as enthusiasm increases. A normal memory will reward the player with a heart point, used later during auditions. A good memory will reward the player with two heart points and increased enthusiasm. If the player chooses to take the day off, an idol's enthusiasm will automatically increase. <b>Days</b> <b>off</b> also give the idol the chance to either stay at home, or go out into town and meet with other characters. The player can check on <b>days</b> <b>off</b> if there are any presents fans have sent the idols, which contain in-game items.|$|E
5|$|Within a year, Laurel Grove failed. Fred was inexperienced {{and made}} poor bargains with local merchants. Before the war, {{plantations}} {{had been largely}} self-sufficient, but Fred paid high prices for goods shipped in from Savannah and Charleston. He took <b>days</b> <b>off</b> {{at a time to}} visit saloons in Jacksonville. An unanticipated infestation of cotton-worm larvae (Helicoverpa zea) destroyed much of the cotton crop. Only two bales were produced by Laurel Grove; Stowe realized the venture was a failure. Fred committed himself to a rehabilitation asylum in New York, and at some point in 1867, Stowe purchased the cottage and the attached grove in Mandarin.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{students}} travel to school using the nation's bus network, which is free for state school students to use. Schools in Malta generally begin their school day at 8:30am and finish at 2:40pm. Students receive three days of holidays in November 15 days of holidays over Christmas, two days of holidays in March and eight days of holidays in April, in addition to public holidays. Maltese school students receive {{the highest number of}} <b>days</b> <b>off</b> of all school students in Europe, with 90 days during the 2010-11 academic year being non-school days. This is 14 days more than the European average of 76. Virtually all Maltese state schools run tuck shops, while some secondary schools are home to cafeterias.|$|E
5|$|Capcom auditioned {{actors to}} be used as {{references}} by the character designers. The faces of the main protagonists were shaped and based on real people, while motion capture was used to animate their models. About 60 percent of the characters' motions were animated based on the captured data, while the rest was created from scratch. The developers initially struggled to develop a system for computer graphic animation. However, Nintendo provided Capcom with assistance and the problems were eventually solved. Capcom also hired new voice actors and rewrote the game's script to make the plot more convincing. The game was developed over the course of one year and two months. Final development of the game was very intense, as programmers had to work for two straight months with no <b>days</b> <b>off</b> to meet the proposed deadline. Resident Evil was released in March 2002 in Japan, April 2002 in North America, and September 2002 in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Filming resumed on August 3, 2006 at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah for 70 <b>days</b> <b>off</b> the California coast, {{as all the}} {{shooting}} required in the Caribbean had been conducted in 2005. Davy Jones's Locker was shot at Utah, and it was shot in a monochromatic way to represent its different feeling from the usual colorful environment of a pirate. The climactic battle was shot in a former air hangar at Palmdale, California, where the cast had to wear wetsuits underneath their costumes on angle-tipped ships. The water-drenched set was kept in freezing temperatures, to make sure bacteria did not come inside and infect the crew. A second unit shot at Niagara Falls. Industrial Light & Magic did 750 effects shots, while Digital Domain also took on 300. They spent just five months finishing the special effects. The film posed numerous challenges in creating water-based effects.|$|E

50|$|There are {{non-working}} {{public holidays}} in Russia; {{all of them}} fall on a fixed date. By law, if such a holiday coincides with an ordinary <b>day</b> <b>off,</b> the next work day becomes a <b>day</b> <b>off.</b> An official public holiday cannot replace a regular <b>day</b> <b>off.</b> Each year the government can modify working weeks near public holidays in order to optimize the labor schedule. For example, if a five-day week has a public holiday on Tuesday or Thursday, the calendar is rearranged to provide a reasonable working week.|$|R

5|$|He {{was offered}} the job as manager of Second Division club Middlesbrough on his 38th {{birthday}} in 1973. He {{declined to be interviewed}} for the position, and instead handed the club a list of responsibilities he expected to take, which if agreed to would give him total control of the running of the club. He refused a contract, and would never sign a contract throughout his managerial career. He took a salary of £10,000 a year despite the chairman being willing to pay a lot more; his only stipulations were a gentleman's agreement that he would not be sacked, assurances that he would have no interference from the board in team affairs, and three <b>days</b> <b>off</b> a week for fishing and shooting. He decided to first repaint Ayresome Park and to publicise the upcoming league campaign so as to generate higher attendance figures.|$|E
5|$|Princess Royal sailed from Cromarty on 28 September to {{rendezvous}} with a Canadian troop convoy {{bound for the}} United Kingdom. She rejoined the 1st BCS on 26 October, but was detached again {{a few days later}} to reinforce the North Atlantic and Caribbean Squadrons in the search for Admiral Graf Spee's German East Asia Squadron after it destroyed the West Indies Squadron on 1November 1914. Princess Royal arrived at Halifax on 21 November, then spent several <b>days</b> <b>off</b> New York City before she steamed down to the Caribbean to guard against the possibility that Graf Spee would use the Panama Canal. The East Asia Squadron was sunk off the Falkland Islands on 7 December, and Princess Royal left Kingston, Jamaica to sail to the UK on 19 December.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees signed Núñez as an {{international}} free agent in 2004. He played minor league baseball in their organization from 2005 through 2010, until he made his MLB debut with the Yankees on August 19, 2010. He has served to allow Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez {{the ability to take}} <b>days</b> <b>off</b> in the field. Due to struggles and inconsistency, the Yankees designated Núñez for assignment {{at the start of the}} 2014 season. He was traded to the Twins, and enjoyed a breakout season in 2016, when he was named to appear in the MLB All-Star Game. He was traded to the Giants in 2016, and to the Red Sox in 2017.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that where}} a public holiday falls on a Saturday or a Sunday, or {{possibly}} coincides with another public holiday, {{it is generally}} observed (as a <b>day</b> <b>off</b> work) on the next available weekday, even though the public holiday itself does not move. In such cases, an employee is entitled {{to at least one}} of the following (as chosen by the employer): a <b>day</b> <b>off</b> within a month, an additional day's paid annual leave or an additional day's pay. The usual practice is, however, to award a <b>day</b> <b>off</b> on the next available weekday.|$|R

5|$|Tropical Depression Sixteen formed {{over the}} {{northern}} Bahamas on September 6. Early on September 7, it organized into Tropical Storm Ophelia, becoming a hurricane the next day. It churned nearly stationary for two <b>days</b> <b>off</b> {{the coast of}} Florida where significant coastal erosion resulted from the churning waves. On September 12, the storm began moving slowly toward North Carolina, at times nearly stalling and alternating between tropical storm and hurricane intensity. The hurricane did not make landfall, although the western eyewall reached the coastal areas of North Carolina, causing extensive damage in the Outer Banks and around Cape Fear. Ophelia moved north and became extratropical late on September 17 near Nova Scotia, but it continued northeastward, producing strong winds and heavy rain over Atlantic Canada.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} Bond films, {{the production}} of Moonraker was not based at Pinewood, as Broccoli moved it to Paris for financial reasons, although the scenes for the cable car interiors and space battle exteriors were filmed at Pinewood, with the special effects team of Derek Meddings active in the UK throughout production. Principal photography began on 11 August 1978 in Paris. The sets designed by returning production designer Ken Adam were the largest ever constructed in France and required more than 222,000 man-hours to construct (approximately 1,000 hours by each of the crew on average). Much of the film {{was shot in the}} cities of London, Paris, Venice, Palmdale, California, Port St. Lucie, Florida and Rio de Janeiro. Principal filming finished back in Paris on 27 February 1979, a 28-week schedule that had allowed Roger Moore only three <b>days</b> <b>off.</b> John Barry was again asked to score an Eon film.|$|E
5|$|Stoke {{slipped down}} {{the league in}} an {{extremely}} tight 1937–38 season, and, annoyed by rumours circulating the city of resentment {{in the dressing room}} against him for his England success, Matthews requested a transfer in February; his request was denied. His request became public knowledge, and, disturbed by the attention and harassment he was receiving from Stoke supporters urging him to stay, Matthews decided to take a few <b>days</b> <b>off</b> from the club to relax in Blackpool. Finding no peace there either, Stoke chairman Albert Booth told Matthews he {{would not be allowed to}} leave the club, and 3,000 City supporters organized a meeting to make their feelings known – they too demanded that he stay. Touched by their strength of feeling and worn out by the attention he was receiving, Matthews agreed to stay. Despite playing regularly for the national side, Matthews put in 38 games for Stoke in 1938–39, helping them to a seventh-place finish – there would not be another full season of Football League action until 1946.|$|E
