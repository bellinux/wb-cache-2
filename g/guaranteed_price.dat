As of 21 February 2006, the EU has decided to reduce the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>price</b> of sugar by 36% over four years, starting in 2006. European production was projected to fall sharply. According to the EU, this is the first serious reform of sugar under the CAP for 40 years. Under the Sugar Protocol to the Lome Convention, nineteen ACP countries export sugar to the EU and will be affected by price reductions on the EU market.|$|E

The policy is twofold: first, to purchase certain crops at <b>guaranteed</b> <b>prices</b> and second, to encourage the production of specific crops through farm subsidies. The policy of purchasing agricultural crops from farmers at <b>guaranteed</b> <b>prices</b> {{was put in place}} in the 1989 crop year. On average, the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>prices</b> increased at the rate of inflation over the past 15 years. Individual subsidy levels for major crops, however, vary annually.|$|R

60|$|Before the war Western and Central Europe {{drew from}} Russia a {{substantial}} part of their imported cereals. Without Russia the importing countries would have had to go short. Since 1914 the loss of the Russian supplies has been made good, partly by drawing on reserves, partly from the bumper harvests of North America called forth by Mr. Hoover's <b>guaranteed</b> <b>price,</b> but largely by economies of consumption and by privation. After 1920 the need of Russian supplies will be even greater than it was before the war; for the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>price</b> in North America will have been discontinued, the normal increase of population there will, as compared with 1914, have swollen the home demand appreciably, and the soil of Europe will not yet have recovered its former productivity. If trade is not resumed with Russia, wheat in 1920-21 (unless the seasons are specially bountiful) must be scarce and very dear. The blockade of Russia, lately proclaimed by the Allies, is therefore a foolish and short-sighted proceeding; we are blockading not so much Russia as ourselves.|$|E

As their annual consumption of wheat per head is not less than 6 bushels, the pre-war scale of production in the United States would only show a substantial surplus over present domestic requirements in about one year out of five. We have been saved for the moment by the great harvests of 1918 and 1919, which have been called forth by Mr. Hoover's <b>guaranteed</b> <b>price.</b> But the United States can hardly be expected to continue indefinitely to raise by a substantial figure the cost of living in its own country, in order to provide wheat for a Europe which cannot pay for it.|$|E

40|$|Since 1938 {{there has}} been a policy of rent {{arbitration}} in the Netherlands. Rent arbitration appeared to be necessary through the price policy of agricultural products. The purpose was to divide agricultural income fairly between farmers and the landowners. The author argued that rent arbitration should also be treated as an instrument and not only a consequence of agricultural price policy. By giving <b>guaranteed</b> <b>prices</b> to the farmers the government influenced on the land rent, but the land rent resulting from arbitration should also influence the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>prices</b> for agricultural products. The thesis provides a detailed description and analysis of the methods of rent arbitration, and some suggestions for improving the methods. Rent arbitration had had an important influence: before rent arbitration came into force, total net rent was about 25 % of agricultural income, whereas it is now only 5 %. It was argued, however, that other influences were also at work; without rent arbitration that percentage could have decreased also. <p/...|$|R
50|$|The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries Act 1919 {{abolished}} the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries {{and created the}} Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, which took on {{the powers of the}} Board and the remaining functions of the Food Production Department established during the war. In 1919, prices of farm produce had risen by 25% compared to prices {{at the end of the}} war. The Agricultural Act 1920 set out <b>guaranteed</b> <b>prices</b> for wheat and oats based on the 1919 averages, to be reviewed annually. However, in the early 1920s, prices fell drastically, the Act was repealed, <b>guaranteed</b> <b>prices</b> were replaced by lump sum payments and the Agricultural Wages Board abolished, as part of the Government's deflationary policies. By 1922, virtually all of war-time controls had gone. The area under cultivation in Britain fell from 12 million acres (49,000 km²) in 1918 to 9 million acres (36,000 km²) in 1926. Farm prices continued to decline and then fell by 34% in the three years after 1929.|$|R
