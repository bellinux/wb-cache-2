25|$|As the {{industry}} strives to reduce {{maintenance and repair}} costs, non-destructive testing of structures becomes increasingly valued both in production control and {{as a means to}} measure the utilization and condition of key infrastructure. There are several measurement techniques to measure stress in a material. However, techniques using optical measurements, magnetic measurements, X-ray diffraction, and neutron <b>diffraction</b> <b>are</b> all limited to measuring surface or near surface stress or strains. Acoustic waves propagate with ease through materials and provide thus a means to probe the interior of structures, where the stress and strain level is important for the overall structural integrity.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{electron}} diffraction {{is often}} {{regarded as a}} qualitative technique suitable for symmetry determination, but too inaccurate for determination of lattice parameters and atomic positions. But there are also several examples where unknown crystal structures (inorganic, organic and biological) have been solved by electron crystallography. Lattice parameters of high accuracy can in fact be obtained from electron diffraction, relative errors less than 0.1% have been demonstrated. However, the right experimental conditions {{may be difficult to}} obtain, and these procedures are often viewed as too time-consuming and the data too difficult to interpret. X-ray or neutron <b>diffraction</b> <b>are</b> therefore often the preferred methods for determining lattice parameters and atomic positions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{effects of}} <b>diffraction</b> <b>are</b> {{often seen in}} {{everyday}} life. The most striking examples of <b>diffraction</b> <b>are</b> those that involve light; for example, the closely spaced tracks on a CD or DVD act as a diffraction grating to form the familiar rainbow pattern seen when looking at a disc. This principle can be extended to engineer a grating with a structure such that it will produce any diffraction pattern desired; the hologram on a credit card is an example. Diffraction in the atmosphere by small particles can cause a bright ring to be visible around a bright light source [...] like the sun or the moon. A shadow of a solid object, using light from a compact source, shows small fringes near its edges. The speckle pattern which is observed when laser light falls on an optically rough surface is also a diffraction phenomenon. [...] When deli meat appears to be iridescent, that is diffraction off the meat fibers. All these effects are {{a consequence of the}} fact that light propagates as a wave.|$|E

6000|$|For the rest, the {{phenomena}} of <b>diffraction</b> <b>are</b> not yet arranged systematically {{enough to be}} usefully discussed; some of them involving {{the resolution of the}} light, and others merely its intensification. My attention was first drawn to them near St. Laurent, on the Jura mountains, by the vivid reflection, (so it seemed), of the image of the sun from a particular point of a cloud in the west, after the sun itself was beneath the horizon: but in this image there were no prismatic colors, neither is the constantly seen metamorphosis of pine forests into silver filigree on ridges behind which the sun is rising or setting, accompanied with any prismatic hue; the trees become luminous, but not iridescent: on the other hand, in his great account of his ascent of Mont Blanc with Mr. Huxley, Professor Tyndall thus describes the sun's remarkable behavior on that occasion:--"As we attained the brow which forms the entrance to the Grand Plateau, he hung his disk upon a spike of rock to our left, and, surrounded by a glory of interference spectra of the most gorgeous colors, blazed down upon us."

50|$|At low {{energies}} the channelling {{effects in}} crystals are not present because small-angle scattering at low energies requires large impact parameters, which become bigger than interplanar distances.
