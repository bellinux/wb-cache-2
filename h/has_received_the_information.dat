40|$|One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} concerns for many helpline staff is how to manage overt forms of distress and anxiety manifest in ‘troubles talk’, while also encouraging (or ‘empowering’) callers {{to take action to}} change the conditions that are creating the distress. Based on an audio-recording of a single call to a Home Birth helpline (drawn from a corpus of 80 such calls), we use conversation analysis to explore how the call-taker negotiates the tension between managing the caller’s distress about her scheduled hospital labour (the ‘presenting problem’), while also encouraging her to arrange a home birth (the ‘problem solution’). We focus on the work the call-taker does to position herself as troubles-talk recipient, while also ensuring {{that by the end of}} the encounter the caller <b>has</b> <b>received</b> <b>the</b> <b>information</b> and advice she needs to take action to organise her home birth...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{so-called}} Black Hole {{model of}} computation involves a non Euclidean space-time where one device is infinitely ``accelerated'' on one world-line but can send some limited information to an observer working at ``normal pace''. The key stone {{is that after}} a finite duration, the observer <b>has</b> <b>received</b> <b>the</b> <b>information</b> or knows that no information was ever sent by the device which had an infinite time to complete its computation. This allows to decide semi-decidable problems and clearly falls out of classical computability. A setting in a continuous Euclidean space-time that mimics this is presented. Not only is Zeno effect possible but {{it is used to}} unleash the black hole power. Both discrete (classical) computation and analog computation (in the understanding of Blum, Shub and Smale) are considered. Moreover, using nested singularities (which are built), it is shown how to decide higher levels of the corresponding arithmetical hierarchies...|$|E

They were wary at first and asked for proof, upon which an Itza messenger brought them a rosary as a token. Looking across the lake they saw men dressed as friars calling to them to come across, these were Itza dressed in the habits of the two Franciscans who had recently been killed at the island.
