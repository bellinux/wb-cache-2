The evolution of <b>interactive</b> <b>systems</b> is generally termed maintenance. Traditionally maintenance soaks up large portions of <b>interactive</b> <b>systems</b> budgets. Despite the many resources given over to maintenance {{there is little evidence}} that any consideration of usability issues takes place in this development stage. This paper is concerned with ramifications of applying four contemporary usability evaluation methods in scenarios where <b>interactive</b> <b>systems</b> are evolving. The four specific methods we examine are: Heuristic Evaluation; the Cognitive Walkthrough; Interacting Cognitive Subsystems; and Cooperative Evaluation.

40|$|Agents are {{becoming}} increasingly common {{as a means of}} structuring <b>interactive</b> <b>systems,</b> due to the highly complex and concurrent nature of modern systems. The manner in which interaction between these agents is specified is of fundamental importance, and must pay heed to expressivity and reuse concerns. There are also concerns specific to <b>interactive</b> <b>systems,</b> and in particular the need to specify and reason about user-system dialogue. We have shown previously that the standard model of object interaction is inadequate with respect to these concerns, and that the action model performs better with respect to these criteria. In this paper these results are drawn together with approaches previously taken in <b>interactive</b> <b>systems.</b> From this basis a schema calculus with interleaving semantics is proposed, which better addresses the concerns of expressivity and reuse in the <b>interactive</b> <b>systems</b> context. 1 Introduction Modern <b>interactive</b> <b>systems</b> are large, complex entities comprisin [...] ...|$|R

We prove that any polynomial-round quantum <b>interactive</b> proof <b>system</b> with two-sided bounded error can be parallelized to a quantum <b>interactive</b> proof <b>system</b> with exponentially small one-sided error in which the prover and verier exchange only 3 messages.

However, its support for building <b>interactive</b> <b>systems</b> is still acknowledged to be insufficient.

In this paper we identify and discuss the major problems using the UML to document, specify and design <b>interactive</b> <b>systems.</b> Here we propose a UML profile for <b>interactive</b> <b>systems</b> development that leverages on human-computer interaction domain knowledge under the common notation and semantics of the UML.
