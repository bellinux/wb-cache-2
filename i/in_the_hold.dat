5|$|Doctor Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley) is {{concerned}} that the increasing numbers of tribbles threaten to consume all the food aboard the Enterprise. It is discovered that they are entering ship systems, interfering with their functions, and consuming any edible contents present. Kirk realizes that if the tribbles are getting into the ship's stores, they are {{a threat to the}} grain aboard the station. He examines the holds but learns that it is already too late: The tribbles have indeed eaten the quadrotriticale, and Kirk is literally buried in grain-gorged tribbles when he opens a grain hold with an overhead hatch. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and McCoy discover that about half the tribbles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> are dead and many of the rest are dying, alerting them that the grain has been poisoned.|$|E
5|$|For three hours, Experiment battled the barges, sinking two {{and killing}} {{a great many}} of the picaroons. During this time two of the barges left the warship and {{attacked}} the merchant ships. These barges managed to protect themselves from Experiment by sailing behind the schooner Mary, which was between the two barges and the warship. The Haitians boarded Mary and killed her captain. Many of the crew jumped into the sea, and the rest hid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hold.</b> The second barge attempted to take Daniel and Mary but was sunk by fire from Experiment. Once the Haitians had boarded Mary, Experiment opened fire upon her with grapeshot, driving the picaroons off.|$|E

5|$|Monitor {{likewise}} did {{not survive}} the year. She was ordered to Beaufort, North Carolina, on Christmas Day, {{to take part in}} the blockade there. While she was being towed down the coast (under command of her fourth captain, Commander John P. Bankhead), the wind increased and with it the waves; with no high sides, the Monitor took on water. Soon the water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> gained on the pumps, and then put out the fires in her engines.

5|$|On 21 July 1768, Endeavour {{sailed to}} Galleon's Reach {{to take on}} armaments to protect her against {{potentially}} hostile Pacific island natives. Ten 4-pounder cannons were brought aboard, six of which were mounted on the upper deck and the remainder stowed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hold.</b> Twelve swivel guns were also supplied, and fixed to posts along the quarterdeck, sides and bow. The ship departed for Plymouth on 30 July, for provisioning and to board her crew of 85, including 12Royal Marines. Cook also ordered that twelve tons of pig iron be brought on board as sailing ballast.|$|E
5|$|The replica {{standing}} mizzen {{is built}} to this shorter measurement and stepped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> on the keelson, {{as is the}} model in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich. There {{is a difference between}} the height of the mizzen fore-and-aft spar in the contemporary painting of Earl of Pembroke before the naval refit of 1768 by Luny (below) and its position on the replica in the photographs, compared to the height of the lowest spars on the fore and mainmasts.|$|E
5|$|A {{more recent}} {{critical}} review of contemporary sources doesn't require a supposed typo in 1771 {{to explain this}} shorter measurement for the mizzen whilst {{at the same time}} offers supporting evidence of its cap being at the taller supposed normal height. Sydney Parkinson's sketches and paintings of Cooks Bark Endeavour along with the 1771 Woolwich Yard Bark Endeavour spar measurements National Maritime Museum in Greenwich NMM ZAZ6594, and other contemporary sources suggest that the shorter mizzen mast was not stepped in the hold/keelson, but instead was stepped in the lower deck 10ft above this as was sometimes done. This would bring its standing height at the cap to within a supposed normal height of around 8– 9ft below the main mast cap and approx 5.5ft below the foremast cap when comparing the heights of the standing mast tops (excludes top and gallant masts) from the level of the water line. Whereas the shorter mizzen stepped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> on the keelson instead of the lower deck would make the standing mizzen cap 18ft below the main mast cap which is clearly not the case when critically examining Sydney Parkinson's drawings and the contemporary painting titled HMS Endeavour off the coast of New Holland, by Samuel Atkins c. 1794 {{at the top of this}} page. Zooming this painting also reveals that the position of the mizzen channel is forward to inline with the mast which it is when looking at the angle of the mizzen chainplates on the original as fitted draught NMM ZAZ7844. Using these mizzen chainplate angles from this as fitted draught it is possible to extrapolate where the top of the standing mast could be and combined with the similar shroud angles Sydney Parkinson drew in his sketch of the larboard quarter of Endeavour support this theory of the shorter standing mizzen stepped in the lower deck which would make its standing cap 10 foot higher than if stepped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hold.</b>|$|E

5|$|For {{those who}} were not injured or killed {{outright}} by moving objects, there was little time to reach safety, especially for the men who were manning the guns on the main deck or fetching ammunition and supplies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hold.</b> The companionways that connected the decks with one another would have become bottlenecks for fleeing men, something indicated by the positioning of many of the skeletons recovered from the wreck. What turned the sinking into a major tragedy in terms of lives lost was the anti-boarding netting that covered the upper decks in the waist (the midsection of the ship) and the sterncastle. With the exception of the men who were stationed in the tops in the masts, most of those who managed to get up from below deck were trapped under the netting; they would have been in view of the surface, and their colleagues above, but with little or no chance to break through, and were dragged down with the ship. Out of a crew of at least 400, fewer than 35 escaped, a catastrophic casualty rate of over 90%.|$|E
5|$|Refrigerated {{ships were}} also made {{possible}} {{through the ice}} trade, allowing perishable goods to be exported internationally, first from the U.S. and then from countries such as Argentina and Australia. Early ships had stored their chilled goods along with the main cargo of ice; the first ships to transport chilled meat to Britain, designed by Bate, adapted the railroad refrigerator cars, using ice {{at either end of}} the hold and a ventilation fan to keep the meat cool. An improved version, invented by James Craven, piped a brine solution through the ice and then the hold to keep the meat cool, and created a drier atmosphere <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hold,</b> preserving the meat better. Natural ice was also used in fishing industries to preserve catches, initially in the eastern American fisheries. In 1858 the Grimsby fishing fleet began to take ice out to sea with them to preserve their catches; this allowed longer journeys and bigger catches, and the fishing industry became the biggest single user of ice in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{transferred}} to the Ministry of War Transport, which renamed her Empire Simba and assigned Andrew Weir & Co. of London to manage her. After spending six weeks at Methil, where she had an advanced ship degaussing system installed among other repairs, Empire Simba proceeded to Oban via Lyness in mid November. She set out for North America in Convoy OB-253 on 2 December. Four days out, heavy weather dispersed the convoy, and Empire Simba proceeded independently. The ship continued to take a beating from heavy seas which opened the number one cargo hold to the ocean. Because the water was coming in faster than the bilge pumps <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> number one could pump, the crew cut through the bulkheads into cargo hold number two to double the pumping capacity and were able to keep the ship under control long enough to arrive in Bermuda on 26 December. After temporary repairs were made there, Empire Simba sailed on 6 January 1942 first to Halifax and then to Baltimore for more permanent repairs.|$|E

5|$|The {{wreckage}} {{was found}} on 22November 1918 {{at a depth of}} , and was salvaged on 12August 1922. Investigations indicated that just one third of the cargo had been stowed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hold,</b> the rest unsecured on deck. The salvage operation turned into a bizarre public attraction; for example, a sewing machine from the steamer was smashed into pieces and sold for one crown each. It is estimated that about 20,000 people came to watch the raising of the ship, requiring the addition of trains from Norrköping. Newsreels featuring the raising of the ship were shown in cinemas all over Sweden. In order to finance the salvage operation, the Per Brahe was sent on a macabre tour throughout Sweden. The newspapers fed people's superstitions that the mythical creatures of the forests had claimed Bauer by sinking the ship. The most common theme was connected to the tale Agneta och sjökungen (Agneta and the Sea King) from 1910 in which the Sea King lures a maiden into the depths. On 18August 1922, the Bauers were buried at the Östra cemetery in Jönköping (in quarter 04 plot number 06).|$|E
5|$|Willaumez {{had planned}} to {{resupply}} his squadron at the Cape itself before searching for the China Fleet, but the crew of a merchant ship captured in the South Atlantic informed him that the Dutch governors had surrendered on 10 January 1806 to an expeditionary force under General Sir David Baird and Commodore Popham after five days of fighting. Turning away from the Cape, Willaumez decided to continue operations in the South Atlantic until April, when he put into Salvador in Brazil for supplies. Willaumez was fortunate to have collected this information before attempting to anchor in Table Bay: Popham had ordered all ships and shore facilities to continue to fly the Dutch flag {{in the hope that}} enemy ships would be lured within range of the port's gun batteries. On 4 March this ruse worked successfully when the frigate Volontaire, detached from Willaumez's squadron in December, anchored in the midst of Popham's squadron without realising their identity. Hopelessly outnumbered, Captain Bretel {{had no choice but to}} surrender, the British boarding party discovering 217 British soldiers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hold,</b> captured by Willaumez from Redmill's convoy.|$|E
