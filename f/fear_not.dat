25|$|Fear may be {{politically}} and culturally manipulated to persuade citizenry of ideas which {{would otherwise be}} widely rejected or dissuade citizenry from ideas which would otherwise be wildly supported. In contexts of disasters, nation-states manage the <b>fear</b> <b>not</b> only to provide their citizens with an explanation about the event or blaming some minorities, but also to adjust their previous beliefs. The manipulation of fear is done by means of symbolic instruments as terror movies and the administration ideologies that lead to nationalism. After a disaster, the fear is re-channeled in a climate of euphoria based on patriotism.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the loss}} in the court case, Tamizhselvi {{requests}} Sivaji out of <b>fear</b> <b>not</b> to come for her again. Sivaji is reduced to utter poverty. Realising that the methods he used are unlikely to work again, he decides {{to play the game}} his own way. Sivaji, {{with the help of his}} uncle Arivu, acquires evidence of 2billion worth of illegal earnings in Adiseshan's possession and uses the documents to blackmail Adiseshan into giving him half the money. He further obtains details on people who have illegal earnings across Tamil Nadu, and blackmails them to give him half of their illegal wealth. He then transfers the money to the bank accounts of his friends around the world by [...] "hawala" [...] forgery. They then deposit the money as donations to Sivaji Foundation, making the money usable and legitimate.|$|E

She appeared at 12:45a.m., {{more than an}} hour after her expected start time of 11:30p.m. Traffic overload to the music video website Vevo, which had exclusive rights to broadcast the concert portion of the event, was given as the reason for her delay. Following the site's crash, Gaga tweeted, [...] "We're working on fixing the Livestream, there's A LOT of traffic. If Vevo does not work in your territory, <b>fear</b> <b>not,</b> we're posting video." [...] Subsequently, she posted of her fans: [...] "Only little monsters can crash Vevo. *face palm*." [...] The live broadcast was available on-demand through various Vevo platforms in the: United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom.

500|$|The {{air raids}} became {{intolerable}} to Manning, and she soon {{moved back to}} Cairo, where {{in the winter of}} 1941 she became press attaché at the United States Legation. In her spare time, she worked on Guests at the Marriage, an unpublished prototype for The Balkan Trilogy, as well as short stories and poetry, some of which she sent to Stevie Smith in the hope of getting them published. Over the years, Stevie had brooded over Manning's desertion of their friendship to marry Reggie, and around this time her jealousy took an overt form; in 1942 she wrote a poem entitled [...] "Murder", in which a man stands beside a grave and admits, [...] "My hand brought Reggie Smith to this strait bed – / Well, fare his soul well, <b>fear</b> <b>not</b> I the dead". In subsequent reprintings, the name [...] "Reggie Smith" [...] was replaced by [...] "Filmer Smith", veiling the allusion, but Manning found out and was furious.|$|E
500|$|The pagoda houses {{footprints}} of Buddha. There {{are four}} bronze standing statues of Buddha which are [...] in height, which are stated {{to be of}} the current age Buddha deified on the four sides of the temple; these four are Kakusandha in the northern face, Konagamana in the eastern wall, Kassapa in the southern wall and the Gautama Buddha to the west wall. All of these Buddhas are cast in beaten bronze and seen with their right hand in a posture of abayamudra, meaning [...] "the <b>fear</b> <b>not</b> gesture" [...] and left hand holding the monk's robe. Below the Buddha Kassapa statue there are a pair of footprints intricately carved on sandstone slab; these were carved from a large [...] "Bodhi-leaf-shaped" [...] slab. They have engravings of a chakra at the centre, which is considered an auspicious symbol. Devotees offer oblations to the footprints through a rectangular wedge created {{at the rear of the}} stone slab. The placing of the footprints gives the viewers an impression of Buddha walking towards them.|$|E
500|$|The Daily Telegraph stated [...] "after yesterday's shock {{demise of}} series pin-up Rupert Penry-Jones as Adam, {{fans of the}} spy drama may be forgiven for {{approaching}} the second episode of the new series with trepidation. <b>Fear</b> <b>not,</b> though, there are no star deaths [...] only one rather welcome one [...]" [...] John Beresford of TV Scoop praised the entire episode, stating [...] "the pace didn't let up from start to finish, the whole thing looked awesome, the acting was pitch perfect," [...] and the dialogue [...] "never drops into the realms of trite, or hyperbole, or parody. Each phrase is like a diamond. Tight, bright and sparkling. And able to cut deep," [...] adding [...] "this series is already {{shaping up to be}} a classic." [...] Beresford also noted Armitage's performance, although this was only his second appearance, [...] "Armitage looks and sounds like he's been here all along." [...] Greg O'Keefe of the Liverpool Echo, who also reviewed the first episode, as both episodes are considered a two-part story, stated it was [...] "packed with great action sequences, razor-sharp writing and the usual quota of twists and turns. We were also treated to some excellent scenes, shot in Moscow, as the pesky Russians were established as the villains of the series." ...|$|E

500|$|Seattle Weeklys Joe Williams {{enjoyed the}} song, writing [...] "even with the slow, {{bubbling}} beat and energetic keyboards, topped with top-notch delivery by Jay and Kay, it's Redding {{in the background}} that gives the single its true life and flair." [...] Josiah Hughes of Exclaim! magazine commented that [...] "if the over-the-top aggression of [...] "H•A•M" [...] had you worried {{that this would be}} a Waka Flocka ripoff, <b>fear</b> <b>not,</b> as [...] "Otis" [...] makes the most of its Otis Redding sample with some soulful feel-good boom-bap." [...] Sam Gould The Independent remarked [...] "having seen oddball rap collective Odd Future become the talking point of the blogosphere, Eminem and old partner-in-crime Royce da 5'9" [...] start work on their own bruising , and hazy vibe rappers Wiz Khalifa and Curren$y take steps in the same direction, Jay and Ye have recognised the throne is far from unchallenged, and have come together in the most remarkable dual alliance since André 3000 and Big Boi became Outkast." [...] The New York Observer writer Foster Kamer mused, [...] "remember early Kanye? These guys finally do. 'Otis' is the perfect anti-single for this album, because it's a reminder that what we always loved about these two collaborating is still very much there. Not only do they not need hooks, neither of them need to remind us that they don't. There was that first line of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, 'I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago,' and then, the relief after it, where you didn't have to worry about the rest of that album", and Billboard claimed [...] "Otis gets better with each play".|$|E

2500|$|Writing in British Sunday {{newspaper}} The Observer, reviewer Mark Kermode {{found the}} film to be a [...] "very funny, and very likable holiday treat." [...] He added, [...] "The ensuing drama is nominally a tale of predators succumbing to their animal instincts while frightened prey fear their neighbours. In fact, it's a delightfully well-orchestrated parable about trust and tolerance versus panic and prejudice. An encouragingly upbeat celebration of love and diversity in times of hate and uncertainty. If that all sounds overly on-message, then <b>fear</b> <b>not</b> – the jokes are funny, the characters engaging, and the animation packed with delicious visual detail," [...] before concluding, [...] " [...] this is proper family fun with genuine cross-generational appeal. Hooray!" ...|$|E
