40|$|Experimental {{study and}} RANS {{calculation}} were performed for a kerosene-fueled swirl laboratory combustor {{with and without}} the air injection through the cross-drilled circular openings in the centerbody of the swirler. The particular interest {{of the work is}} to explore the potential advantages of the centerbody air injection in enhancing the non-premixed combustion performance of the swirl combustor. Specifically, the velocity and temperature fields were measured under non-reacting and reacting flow conditions, respectively, to investigate the influence of the centerbody air injection on the central recirculation zone, which plays a crucial role in combustion stabilization. Numerical calculation based on RANS was conducted and compared with the experimental measurements to further quantify experimental observations. In addition, the combustion efficiency was evaluated based on the after burning flue-gas analysis. The experimental and numerical results show that an enlarged recirculation zone with higher temperature can be formed in the swirl combustor with the centerbody air injection, which therefore may hold potentials in enhancing flame stabilization and combustion efficiency. In addition, the centerbody air injection pushes the recirculation zone to the farther downstream of the fuel injector and hence can reduce the exposure of the fuel injector to the higherature combustion zone. Since the centerbody air injection was found to only slightly modify the effective swirl number, the modified velocity and temperature characteristics are mainly due to the changes of the shape and location of the central recirculation zone and the local stoichiometry in the vicinity of fuel injection. A parametric study for various inlet <b>air</b> velocities and <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> <b>factors</b> further substantiates the effectiveness of the centerbody air injection on improving the combustion performance although the extent of the improvement relies on other factors that therefore merits future studies for optimization design.

40|$|AbstractThe {{pharmaceutical}} residues from {{chemical synthesis}} pharmaceutical industry often contain some alkali salts {{due to the}} widely use of alkali salts in the manufacturing process, the waste management of such is a significant challenge. Generally, the residues are disposed by landfill and incineration. However landfill is unsustainable and the incineration's efficiency is effected by furnace slag-bonding during combustion, that affects the widely use of incineration. On the other hand, molten salt oxidation is an efficient, flameless thermal process, has the inherent capability of destroying organic constituents of wastes while retaining the inorganic constituents in the molten salt. Therefore, a new access is proposed by disposing the residues using molten salt oxidation. A high salt content pharmaceutical residue that contains 28. 82 wt% Na has been selected as the sample. Molten salt oxidation experiments have been conducted in a lab-scale molten salt reactor using a ternary salt (Li,Na,K) 2 CO 3. The experimental parameters investigated here are the temperature of molten salt and the <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> <b>factor.</b> The concentrations of the CO, NOx and SOx in the off-gas are monitored on-line. Results show that the concentration of CO decreases with temperature increasing, especially at temperature higher than 600 ̊C. The SOx in the off-gas has been detected rarely, irrespective of the operating conditions. When the temperature is below 700 ̊C, the concentrations of NOx in the off-gas are under 200 ppm, but as the temperature reached 700 ̊C, due to the nitrite in salt bath begins to decompose, the concentration increases dramatically, suggests the operating temperature should below 700 ̊C in order to suppress the emission of NOx. Compared to the temperature's role, {{the effect on the}} residue's oxidation of the <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> <b>factor</b> is relative small. In the drained salt no char has been found and the XRD analysis shows that the main content of the salt is still (Li,Na,K) 2 CO 3.

Gaseous (Nitric oxide (NO), Carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC)) and particulate emissions (particle mass (PM 2. 5) and particle number) testing was conducted at intermediate speed (1700 rpm) using 4 load settings with ethanol substitution percentages ranging from 10 - 40 % (by energy). With ethanol fumigation, NO and PM 2. 5 emissions were reduced, whereas CO and HC emissions increased considerably and particle number emissions increased at most test settings. It was found that ethanol fumigation reduced the <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> <b>factor</b> for the engine and this led to increased emissions of CO and HC, but decreased emissions of NO. PM 2. 5 emissions were reduced with ethanol fumigation, as ethanol has a very low “sooting” tendency. This is due to the higher hydrogen-to-carbon ratio of this fuel, and also because ethanol does not contain aromatics, both of which are known soot precursors. The use of a diesel oxidation catalyst (as an after-treatment device) is recommended to achieve a reduction in the four pollutants that are currently regulated for compression ignition engines. The increase in particle number emissions with ethanol fumigation was due to the formation of volatile (organic) particles; consequently, using a diesel oxidation catalyst will also assist in reducing particle number emissions...|$|E

Instrumentation for temperature, velocity and concentration measurements {{was developed and}} fully automated by interfacing to a microprocessor for rapid data acquisition. Flame stability limits were determined {{over a wide range}} of operating conditions by varying swirl, secondary air temperature and excess air levels while maintaining the burner momentum constant. Addition of swirl up to a limit of O~ 69 generally improved stability. Preheating secondary air alone was beneficial only if the temperature was raised to at least 250 oC. A combination of intermediate swirl and moderate preheat of the secondary air resulted in satisfactory flame stability over a wide range of calorific values of the fuel. Thus, existing concentric pipe burner systems may be easily modified at low cost to burn LCV gases of variable compositions. With LCV gas flames the <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> <b>factor</b> (EAF) had a major influence on values of temperature, species concentration and velocity. Unburnt hydrocarbon (UHC) and CO not surprisingly increased in concentration close to the blow-off limits under the majority of operating conditions.

On the other hand, burnout efficiencies at the exhaust were reasonably high for most operating conditions involving LCV gases. The combustion data were analysed to extract the characteristic mixing and chemical reaction times the ratio of which gave the parameter epsilon, originally proposed for unconfined flames. Close to the blow-off limit epsilon took the value 4. 9 compared with 6. 2 for fully stable flames.

40|$|The <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> {{ratio of}} the burned zone, Ad, which was {{estimated}} by two-zone model analysis, was compared with the <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> {{ratio of the}} modeled steady-state fuel spray and diffusion flame. There was little correlation between λ_d and the averaged <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> ratio in the cylinder λ_m, and λ_d was mainly dominated by the characteristics of fuel spray and ignition delay. The <b>excess</b> <b>air</b> ratio during the premixed combustion period minimally influenced upon the NO formation fraction if the premixed combustion fraction was less than 50 %. The major factors of NO_x reduction were investigated using the two-zone model. As a result, it was made clear that a large NO_x reduction due to timing retard was mainly caused by both a decrease of combustion temperature and a large decrease in combustion pressure on the expansion stroke, and a small NO_x reduction with the decreased nozzle hole diameter {{was caused by a}} decrease of combustion pressure based on the decrease of the heat release rate in the premixed combustion...|$|R
