40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} a {{fuzzy logic}} control {{system designed to}} determine, regulate and maintain the amount of suction needed by a robotic <b>gripper</b> <b>system</b> to perform reliable limp material manipulation. A neuro-fuzzy approach is followed to {{determine the amount of}} desired suction (depending on experimentally derived data and plant characteristics). A knowledge-based valve controller is then designed to generate, regulate and maintain the amount of suction calculated by the neuro-fuzzy suction module. The performance of the overall suction control system is compared with actual experimental results obtained when using a prototype <b>gripper</b> <b>system</b> to handle limp material.

Addressing this task, one aim of the Fraunhofer IPT {{is the development of}} new concepts of active <b>gripper</b> <b>systems.</b> In this context a highly integrated, adaptive, rugged and economical <b>gripper</b> <b>system</b> particularly for accurate {{handling and}} alignment of flexible micro parts down to the sub-micron level has been developed. This <b>gripper</b> <b>system</b> can be used on conventional robot systems for carrying out microassembly operations.

Such systems are normally highly sensitive against mechanical impact and extremely cost intensive. In this paper the development of a highly robust gripper-integrable axes system and its integration in a novel gripper design with a multi-axis adjustment system is presented. The stage is based on the principle of a hydrostatic transmission, which has not been used in micro-assembly before.

40|$|International audiencePrecision {{assembly}} of hybrid micro systems requires {{not only a}} high precision handling and adjusting of the parts but also a highly accurate and fast bonding technique. In this field adhesive technology {{is one of the}} major joining techniques. At the Collaboration Research Center 516, a batch process based on a joining technique using hot melt adhesives was developed. This technique allows the coating of micro components with hot melt in a batch. The coating process is followed by the joining process. Due to this, the time between coating and joining can be designed variably. Because of the short set times of hot melt adhesives short joining times are possible. For this assembly process adapted heat management and adapted <b>gripper</b> <b>systems</b> are very important. Primarily, the conception and construction of suitable grippers, which realize the complex requirements of the heat management, meet a high challenge. This paper presents an active <b>gripper</b> <b>system</b> for the joining of micro parts using hot melt adhesives. Furthermore, first examinations and results of an assembly process using this gripper for bonding with hot melt adhesives are presented...|$|R

40|$|At present, the {{manufacturing}} of large parts from carbon {{fiber reinforced plastic}} in aerospace is mostly done by manual labor. One of the objectives of The Center of Lightweight Production Technology in Augsburg, Germany, is to transfer manual production methods into automated processes. This work addresses the process chain starting with dry textiles, via production integrated quality assurance, to a cured part. A <b>gripper</b> <b>system</b> is required to handle the pliable and delicate dry carbon fiber textiles in the preforming process.

40|$|Today, {{handling}} and assembly of flexible micro-components such as thin wires or glass fibres with diameters {{down to a}} few micrometers and lateral dimensions up to a few meters is an important challenge in hybrid micro-assembly (Brecher and Peschke 2004). Production of flow sensors for respirators in medical engineering or coupling a fibre to an active visual component in optical data communication are examples of such applications. Such products {{have one thing in}} common: The assembly of their most sensitive functional components is often carried out manually since the {{handling and}} positioning technology either has to be specially developed and is costly or is non-existent (Weck and Peschke 2003). However, in most cases the manual assembly is very time consuming and its repeatability and positioning accuracy is not adequate (Carrozza et al. 2000); Petersen (2003). This disadvantage is obvious especially in the assembly of hybrid micro-optical telecommunication systems such as switches or power splitters, because the required mounting tolerances are less than a micron. A deviation of 100 nm in the alignment between the optical components and the glass fibres leads to noticeable and non-tolerable losses when coupling light into the fibres. With this background, fundamental studies are carried out at Fraunhofer IPT for the optimization of gripper geometry, gripper materials and gripping parameters for handling flexible micro-components such as glass fibres. The aim of these studies, shown in chapter 2 of this paper, is primarily to investigate the effects on the reproducibility of the positioning when gripping these highly sensitive micro-components and to derive gripper optimization strategies. A further aim is to develop a large scale integrated, adaptive, rugged and economical <b>gripper</b> <b>system</b> particularly for handling and alignment of flexible micro-components accurate to the sub-micron level. This <b>gripper</b> <b>system</b> can be used on conventional robot systems for carrying out micro-assembly operations.

The problem of such systems is that they are normally highly sensitive against mechanical impact. Also their gripper integration is problematical due to a high weight and size dimensions in the decimetre range for each axis. In this paper the development of a highly robust gripper-integrable multi-axes system is presented...|$|R
