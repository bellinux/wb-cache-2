5|$|Now Sunderland <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> {{hard it is}} {{to score}} against this terrific defence of ours. Not for nothing have we scored 18 goals against two (both of them freaks) conceded in five ties all away from home. What can I say to do justice to that {{brilliant}} goalkeeper Gil Merrick, to wonderful young Trevor Smith and to the matchless Jeff Hall and Ken Green? Once again they mixed the old cement and constructed that brilliant wall of a defence. Sunderland would have needed to call in a firm of demolition contractors to destroy it.|$|E

500|$|Drizzt {{was created}} by happenstance. In 1987 R.A. Salvatore sent Mary Kirchoff, then {{managing}} editor of TSR's book department, a manuscript for what would become his 1990 novel Echoes of the Fourth Magic. She liked it, but {{asked if he could}} rewrite it to take place in the Forgotten Realms. She sent him Darkwalker on Moonshae by Douglas Niles, the only novel at the time set in the Forgotten Realms. Salvatore sent her a proposal for a sequel to Darkwalker, but Kirchoff sent back a large map of the Forgotten Realms and told him she wanted a new story set in {{a different part of the}} Realms. After two weeks of phone calls, Salvatore found a spot on the map that was not already designated for another project, and he located Icewind Dale there.

500|$|Snake Rattle 'n' Roll was {{developed}} primarily by Rare employees Tim Stamper and Mark Betteridge. Stamper {{worked on the}} game's graphics and concepts, while Betteridge worked on the game program itself. Most of the ideas behind the game came from Betteridge, who had challenged himself to get the smallest file size for a NES game possible. According to Rare member Brendan Gunn, Betteridge <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> to develop cheap backgrounds that took up little space. After thinking about what and how to move objects on such backgrounds, {{he came up with}} the idea for a snake. Much of the game derived from another isometric video game Marble Madness, of which Rare published the NES version in 1989. They would also use the same type of high speed scrolling that was used in the NES port of Marble Madness, which, according to a Nintendo Power overview of Rare, [...] "many said couldn't be done on the NES". Rare's future Creative Director, Gregg Mayles, started with the company play-testing Snake Rattle 'n' Roll.

2500|$|As the {{previous}} election had been close, the by-election campaign was an intense {{one in which}} the candidates addressed meetings [...] "at breakfast time, during the dinner hour, and in the evening". One of the main campaign issues was the Clerical Tithes Bill, which the Conservative-dominated government was promoting; the Bill gave additional help to Church of England clergy and to Church schools. Oldham included many non-conformists who were opposed to the Bill. When the issue of the Bill was raised, the Liberal candidates opposed it, arguing that Parliament was not the place to discuss matters of faith; Churchill initially supported it on the basis that legislation was needed to maintain law and order. A Protestant delegation representing several organisations was pleased with the pledge to support the Bill and strongly endorsed Churchill and Mawdsley. However, when Churchill (who later admitted that he knew nothing of the issue) <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> unpopular the Bill was, he declared in a speech three days before polling day that he would have voted against it in accordance with the wishes of his constituents.|$|E

40|$|Bourdieu {{presented}} {{his theory of}} class and class reproduction and I'm interested in <b>founding</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> does socialization process affect this dynamic process in an egalitarian western country. Does educational system determine {{the future of the}} children by renewing the class structure or does the equal opportunities to succeed academically invalidate the reproduction cycle. By using longitudinal Alkuportaat-data (N= 2258) from years 2006 - 2008 a co-variate analysis and a hierarchical modelling were made. Mathematical problem-solving and fluency in mother tongue were used as indicators for successful secondary socialization. The class structure is presented by parents' socio-economic status, degree of vocational training and family structure. Co-variate analysis suggests that there isn't a definitive connection between parents status variables and children’s school achievement. Thus it seems that Finnish elementary school breaks the reproduction cycle according to the co-variate analysis. Intracorrelates in the school and classroom clusters suggests that children's school achievement is explained by within-factors or the properties of a single student. Hierarchical model for Alkuportaat-data suggests that school is more important socializing environment for children than home. Reflecting back to previous studies on this matter it seems that Finnish society and educational policy supports the social-democratic ideal of equal opportunities for every citizen by taking the social classes out off the equation...|$|R
