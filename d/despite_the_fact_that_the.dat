5|$|<b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{airplane}} {{was officially}} retired {{and had not}} flown since 1957, at least one F2Y was still in storage as of 1962. As a result, it was redesignated YF-7A under the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system.|$|E
5|$|In Canada and Sweden it {{has been}} shown that growing a mosaic of {{different}} crops encourages bumblebees and provides higher yields than does a monoculture of oilseed rape, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bees were attracted to the crop.|$|E
5|$|On 21 April 2011 {{the area}} around Oblivion was given a slight revamp to {{incorporate}} promotion for Fanta, the ride's new sponsor. The sponsorship included posters saying '15,000ft drop, bring it on', <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> drop is actually 180 ft (55m). However, these were later removed after complaints from riders.|$|E

50|$|It {{is noted}} {{that there are a}} number of errors in the making of <b>the</b> film. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> New Orleans is {{actually}} below sea level, the movie shows sinkholes in a cavern extending more than 60 ft underground, and bone dry, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> virtually any digging underground in the real New Orleans would result in flooded ground.|$|R
50|$|The {{problem is}} whether to {{quantify}} the whole ring as a single species (<b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> not all individuals can interbreed) or to classify each population as a distinct species (<b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it can interbreed with its near neighbours). Ring species illustrate that the species concept is not as clear-cut as it is often thought to be.|$|R
5|$|A major {{accomplishment}} of the Johnson administration was {{the passage of}} a legislative redistricting bill. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Constitution requires redistricting after every decennial census, Kentucky's legislative districts had remained virtually unchanged between 1893 and 1941. He asked the 1942 legislative session to adjourn early so he could call a special session {{for the sole purpose of}} considering a redistricting bill. The legislators obliged, and passed a bill by the end of the special session.|$|E
5|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was filmed in October 2012. It {{features}} hip hop-inspired dance moves choreographed by renowned American choreographers Nappytabs. It won the award for Video of the Year at the first YouTube Music Awards in 2013, which generated much attention for beating other popular nominees like Justin Bieber and Psy <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> group was considered lesser-known to the Western audience at the time.|$|E
5|$|A test {{session was}} held on May 17 and 18 at the Paul Ricard circuit in France, with the track {{configured}} to replicate {{the characteristics of the}} Circuit Gilles Villeneuve for the final two days after {{it had been in the}} style of the Monaco for the first two. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> McLaren team had dominated on the Monaco set up of the circuit, Ferrari were better on the Canadian set up.|$|E

5|$|Alarmed at {{the popular}} appeal of Paine's Rights of Man, the king issued a {{proclamation}} against seditious writings in May 1792. Booksellers and printers bore {{the brunt of}} this law, the effects of which {{came to a head}} in the 1794 Treason Trials. Johnson testified, publicly distancing himself from Paine and Barlow, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> defendants were received sympathetically by the juries.|$|E
5|$|Ciudad Juárez, {{defended by}} 700 troops, was {{surrounded}} on three sides, {{with the only}} possible exit route for the besieged federales being the northern path into El Paso and the US. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> revolutionaries had cut off the water supplies into town and the garrison was low on ammunition, its commander, Gen. Juan N. Navarro, refused to surrender, convinced that the inexperience of the rebels in laying sieges {{would allow him to}} hold out.|$|E
5|$|<b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Russos' {{studies found}} similar risk rates between virgin and {{pregnancy}} interrupted rats, their research {{would be used}} to support the contention that abortion created a greater risk of breast cancer for the next twenty years. However, because rats do not exhibit naturally occurring breast cancer, the extrapolation of these results to human abortion and breast cancer is viewed as dubious.|$|E

5|$|<b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} working {{titles of}} the film were first The Beatles and then Beatlemania, the group's name is never spoken in the movie—it is, however, visible on Ringo's drum kit, on the stage lighting, and on the helicopter in the final scene. The television performance scene also contains a visual pun on the group's name, with photos of beetles visible {{on the wall behind}} the dancers.|$|E
5|$|Family {{tradition}} {{holds that}} Johnson broke off an early marital engagement {{when he was}} about sixteen years old because of his mother's disapproval. Purportedly Johnson vowed revenge for his mother's interference. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> engagement was broken off, a daughter named Celia was born. She was raised by the Johnson family and later married to Wesley Fancher, {{one of the men who}} served in Johnson's regiment at the Battle of the Thames.|$|E
5|$|II Napoleon {{ordered the}} {{assemblage}} of over 5,000 artillery for transport through the pass, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pass was widely {{considered to be}} much too narrow, and the route too volatile and unstable, to allow any form of artillery, light or heavy, to come through. Thus, Napoleons military advisers warned him against this move, but he insisted on this presence of this great number of artillery.|$|E

5|$|Newman had a mixed {{record with}} French-language films. He defended Pierre Perrault's Un pays sans bon sens! to a {{committee}} of parliament in 1971, but the same year personally rejected the release of Michel Brault's film about the October Crisis, Les ordres. This was <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> film had already {{been approved by the}} board's French-language committee, and it was not eventually released until Brault personally released it in 1974.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} day of the meeting, co-founder of Rolls-Royce and pioneer aviator Charles Rolls was thrown from his plane, which {{disintegrated}} beneath him. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first-ever powered flight had occurred only seven years previously, Rolls had been attempting a precision landing. He died from his injuries shortly after his fall.|$|E
5|$|Alfano {{was accused}} of being {{the man behind the}} murder of rival Camorra boss Gennaro Cuocolo and his wife. The trial against Alfano and his {{associates}} in Viterbo in 1911–12, expanded from a murder case into a tribunal against the Camorra and attracted a lot of attention of newspapers and the general public both in Italy {{as well as in the}} United States. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison in July 1912, and <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> legitimacy of the trial was seriously questioned when the main witness for the prosecution retracted, he was only released in 1934 after having served 27 years.|$|E

5|$|Amazon river dolphins, {{known by}} the natives as the boto or encantados, are very {{prevalent}} in the mythology of the native South Americans. They are often characterized in their mythology as wielding superior musical ability, their seductiveness and love of sex, often resulting in illegitimate children, and their attraction to parties. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Encante are said {{to come from a}} utopia full of wealth and without pain or death, the encantados crave the pleasures and hardships of human societies.|$|E
5|$|American goldfinches are {{occasionally}} {{victims of}} brood parasites, particularly brown-headed cowbirds. One {{study found that}} 9% of nests had brown-headed cowbird eggs in them. American goldfinches make very poor hosts for brood parasites, with studies showing low hatching rates of brown-headed cowbird eggs and no fledging success. This is <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> American goldfinch has no known behavioral adaptations against brood parasites. It is thought that the inability of brown-headed cowbird chicks to survive {{is due to a}} failure to get enough nutrition; the seed-rich diet of American goldfinch chicks varies from the usual insect-rich diet of other hosts.|$|E
5|$|Cagney made a rare TV {{appearance}} in the lead role of the movie Terrible Joe Moran in 1984. This was his last role. Cagney's health was fragile and more strokes had confined him to a wheelchair, but the producers worked his real-life mobility problem into the story. They also decided to dub his impaired speech, using the impersonator Rich Little. The film made use of fight clips from Cagney's boxing movie Winner Take All (1932), <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> TV movie is about an entirely different character.|$|E
