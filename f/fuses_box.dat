50|$|A {{common design}} of <b>fuse</b> <b>box</b> that was {{featured}} on homes built from 1940 to 1965 was the 60-amp <b>fuse</b> <b>box</b> that featured four plug fuses (i.e. Edison base) for branch circuits {{and one or}} more fuse blocks containing cartridge fuses for purposes such as major appliance circuits. After 1965, the more substantial 100 A panel with three-wire (230 V) service became common; a <b>fuse</b> <b>box</b> could have <b>fuse</b> blocks for the main shut-off and an electric range circuit plus a number of plug fuses (Edison base or Type S) for individual circuits.|$|R

The fire was caused due to a sudden power surge and the <b>fuse</b> <b>box</b> failed to handle the surge. Usually the <b>fuse</b> <b>box</b> will trip the system and activate safety measures, but on that day the <b>fuse</b> <b>box</b> failed to do so and instead burst into flames.

Frequently, these are used {{in close proximity to}} starter battery <b>fuse</b> <b>boxes.</b> They are used also in electric vehicles, e.g., in forklift trucks. Because strip fuses require the use of tools for replacement they are therefore legally considered non-serviceable components for end-users.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{features}} of The Things gameplay is the inclusion of multiple NPCs who join Blake at various points throughout the game. At any one time, the player can control up to four characters; Blake and three NPCs. There are three types of NPC in the game; engineers, soldiers and medics. Engineers can repair <b>fuse</b> <b>boxes,</b> which control locked doors, computers and save points. Soldiers have more health, and are better shots than engineers or medics. They are thus more suited to combat. Medics are capable of healing both Blake and any other injured NPCs, and carry unlimited health packs. The player can issue basic commands to each NPC, such as ordering them to follow Blake, ordering them remain where they are, ordering them to give Blake their weapon, and, {{in the case of}} engineers, ordering them to fix a <b>fuse</b> <b>box.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Fuse</b> <b>Boxes</b> {{normally}} use cartridge or rewirable fuses with {{no other}} protective device, and basic 4-ways boxes are very common. Some older boxes are made of brown-black bakelite, sometimes with a wooden base.

Fuseholders in these boxes may not provide protection from accidental contact with live terminals.|$|R
