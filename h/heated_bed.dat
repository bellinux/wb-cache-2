40|$|A large-scale, outdoor {{vermicomposting}} {{system was}} monitored for 80 weeks. Earthworm populations were recorded for 60 weeks in unheated beds operating at ambient temperatures (34 weeks at 6. 3 ± 2. 3 °C) and in <b>heated</b> <b>beds</b> controlled at 13. 7 ± 0. 8 °C for 34 weeks. Both blocks of beds were at ambient temperatures {{for the remaining}} 26 weeks. Earthworm biomass and the numbers of hatchlings and cocoons produced for the <b>heated</b> <b>beds</b> {{were found to be}} significantly greater than for the unheated beds. Nitrous oxide fluxes in winter (week 60) were 3. 2 ± 0. 3 mg m– 2 h– 1 (unheated beds), 1. 8 ± 0. 3 mg m– 2 h– 1 (<b>heated</b> <b>beds),</b> and these were significantly different to the control beds (0. 1 ± 0. 0 mg m– 2 h– 1). Emissions during summer (week 80) were 20. 1 ± 3. 0 mg m– 2 h– 1 (unheated beds), 21. 3 ± 2. 8 mg m– 2 h– 1 (<b>heated</b> <b>beds)</b> and these were significantly different to the control beds 3. 9 ± 1. 7 mg m– 2 h– 1. No relationship between earthworm density and nitrous oxide flux was found for the large-scale beds. However, in a subsequent laboratory experiment, nitrous oxide emissions were positively correlated with earthworm density (R 2 = 0. 76). Maintaining moderate bed temperatures for vermicomposting systems during low ambient temperatures can significantly increase earthworm density. Vermicomposting systems have the capacity to emit high levels of nitrous oxide and earthworms appear to be primarily responsible for this. The environmental impact from nitrous oxide emissions appears to be comparable to other waste processing operations. Further research is required into ways of minimising emissions especially from vermicomposting systems operating at high earthworm densities and high waste processing rates. ...|$|R

40|$|Denitrification {{beds are}} {{a simple and}} {{relatively}} inexpensive technology for removing nitrate from point source discharges. To date, operational beds have used wood media as the carbon source, as it provides a sustained nitrate removal rate (2 – 10 g N m⁻³ of media d⁻¹) while maintaining permeability. In pilot-scale (2. 9 m⁻³) denitrification beds receiving municipal wastewater effluent dosed with KNO₃, we looked at improving nitrate removal by using alternative carbon media (maize cobs) and increasing bed temperature through passive solar heating. The influence of flow regime (horizontal-point, horizontal-diffuse, downflow and upflow) on short-circuit flow was also investigated. The long-term nitrate removal rate (21. 8 g N m⁻³ d⁻¹) of the maize cob beds over the 15 -month period of the trial was 2 – 11 -fold higher than sustained removal rates reported by other researchers for wood-based beds. While passive solar heating raised the mean bed temperature by 3. 4 °C, it did not cause a measurable increase in the nitrate removal rate due to the variability in the removal rate exceeding the expected increase due to temperature. Horizontal flow had more short-circuiting than vertical flow. Short-circuiting in the horizontal flow was attributed to flow being concentrated near the top surface due to the buoyancy effect of warmer water. Greater short-circuiting in the solar heated horizontal and upflow beds than in the corresponding unheated beds was attributed to the buoyancy effect being more pronounced in the solar <b>heated</b> <b>beds.</b> Overall, downflow was deemed the most effective of the four tested flow regimes. It provided the highest increase in bed temperature due to solar heating, had the highest nitrate removal rate {{in the latter part}} of the trial and had more plug-flow characteristics. While passive solar <b>heating</b> raised <b>bed</b> temperature, we were unable to demonstrate a significant difference (at 95 % CL) in nitrate removal rate between the unheated and solar <b>heated</b> <b>beds</b> because of the high variability in nitrate removal rate and the increase in short-circuiting in the solar heated horizontal and upflow beds...|$|R

METHODSIn order to verify the feasibility and the comfort of thisnewsystem, Airpark software was used to simulate these two living rooms {{based on the measured}} data. Simulated the indoor temperature of new heating system room and traditional heating room, analyzed PMV and PPD of these two living rooms, and quantify their thermal comfort. RESULTSSimulation results show that the average PMV of traditional heating room is around - 1. 19, while the average PMV of new heating model room is - 0. 10; and the average PPD of traditional heating room is 39. 8 %, while the average PPD of the new heating model room is 13. 47 %. CONCLUSIONSIt is obviously that the room with new heating system is more comfortable than the room with traditional heating system.
