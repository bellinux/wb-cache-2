5|$|Currency {{was often}} used for {{settling}} judicial fines, taxes and payments for goods or services. However, remuneration for services to the king, officials and temples were often made {{in the form of}} land revenue. The oldest coins found at Anuradhapura date up to 200 BC. These earliest coins were punch marked rectangular pieces of silver known as kahavanu. These eventually became circular in shape, which were in turn followed by die struck coins. Uncoined metals, particularly gold and silver, were used for trading as well. Patterns of elephants, horses, swastika and Dharmacakra were commonly <b>imprinted</b> <b>on</b> the coins of this period.|$|E
5|$|In season one, Lex hires Roger Nixon (Tom O'Brien), a {{reporter}} for the tabloid newspaper The Inquisitor, to discover how he survived the automobile accident where Clark saved him from drowning. All the evidence points to Clark having been hit by Lex's car, but Lex refuses to believe that is what happened so Nixon attempts to expose Clark to everyone. Around the same time, Lex also enlists the help of Dr. Hamilton (Joe Morton); Hamilton is commissioned to study the effects of the meteor rocks. Hamilton finds an octagonal disc, with unknown symbols <b>imprinted</b> <b>on</b> the disc's surface that match those on Clark's ship, while searching for traces of an alien ship that landed in Smallville in 1989. The disc is eventually stolen by Nixon in an attempt to open Clark's ship.|$|E
5|$|Reptile later {{appears in}} the 1995 film Mortal Kombat as a bipedal lizard, camouflaging himself until found by Liu Kang. After being thrown into a statue, Reptile {{transforms}} into a human-looking ninja and battles Liu Kang, but is defeated and then crushed after reverting to his original form. Reptile's lizard form was rendered {{with the use of}} computer-generated imagery, while the character's human form is portrayed by Keith Cooke, clothed similar to Scorpion and Sub-Zero in the film, but green and with a fanged open mouth <b>imprinted</b> <b>on</b> his face mask. Originally not included in the movie, Reptile was added in response to focus groups being unimpressed with the original fights in the film. Actor Robin Shou (Liu Kang) and director Paul Anderson noted that neither knew what Reptile's lizard form would look like until after filming, making the pre-fight sequence difficult to shoot.|$|E

Thomas Spencer also <b>imprinted</b> <b>on</b> his nephew his own firm free-trade and anti-statist political views.

25|$|Following Australia's {{involvement}} in the Vietnam War, interest in Anzac Day reached its lowest point. On 26 April 1975 The Australian newspaper covered the passing of Anzac Day in a single story.

This phenomenon has been perceived by some as a reflection of the desire of younger generations of Australians to honour the sacrifices made by the previous generations.|$|E
25|$|Before 1898, {{devotion to}} the Holy Face of Jesus used an image based on the Veil of Veronica, where legend recounts that Veronica from Jerusalem {{encountered}} Jesus along the Via Dolorosa {{on the way to}} Calvary. When she paused to wipe the sweat from Jesus's face with her veil, the image was <b>imprinted</b> <b>on</b> the cloth. The establishment of these images as Catholic devotions traces back to Sister Marie of St Peter and the Venerable Leo Dupont who started and promoted them from 1844 to 1874 in Tours France, and Sister Maria Pierina De Micheli who associated the image from the Shroud of Turin with the devotion in 1936 in Milan Italy.|$|E
