40|$|Mutations in 13 genes {{affecting}} muscle {{development in}} Drosophila {{have been examined}} in pairwise combinations for evidence of genetic interactions. Heterozygous combinations of mutations in five genes, including the gene coding for myosin heavy chain, result in more severe phenotypes than respective single heterozygous mutant controls. The various mutant interactions include examples showing allele-specific intergenic interactions, gene specific interactions, and allele-specific <b>intragenic</b> <b>complementations,</b> suggesting that some interactions result from {{the manner in which}} mutant gene products associate. Interactions that result from alterations in ``+'' gene copy number were also uncovered, suggesting that normal myofibril development requires that the relative amounts of respective gene products produced be tightly regulated. The importance of the latter parameter is substantiated by the finding that all five interacting loci map to disperse haploinsufficient or haplolethal regions of the genome. The implications of the present findings are discussed in relation to pursuing the phenomena involving genetic interactions to identify new genes encoding interacting myofibrillar proteins, to examine the nature of intermolecular interactions in mutant and normal development and to decipher the quantitative and temporal regulation of a large family of functionally related gene products...|$|R
40|$|Fifty temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of Chandipura virus, a human rhabdovirus, {{have been}} {{classified}} into six complementation groups, designated ChI, ChII, ChII, ChIV, ChV, and ChVI and containing 44, 2, 1, 1, 1, and 1 mutants, respectively. Weak complementation was observed within group ChI, allowing {{the division of}} the group into subgroups ChIA and ChIB. Intragroup complementation was most extensive within subgroup ChIB, and one mutant in this subgroup complemented all but one (ts Ch 598) of the mutants in group ChI. If ts Ch 598 had been omitted from the analysis the number of complementation groups would have been increased to seven. Consequently, in circumstances where <b>intragenic</b> and intergenic <b>complementation</b> cannot be clearly distinguished, the number of complementation groups identified in rhabdoviruses could be overestimated. The identification of six complementation groups in three different rhabdoviruses need not imply the existence of an as yet unidentified sixth virus-specified polypeptide. The extensive intragroup complementation observed in Chandipura virus suggests that the functional form of one at least of the virion proteins of Chandipura virus is a multimer...|$|R
40|$|Utilization of sucrose as {{a source}} of carbon and energy in yeast (Saccharomyces) is {{controlled}} by the classical SUC genes, which confer the ability to produce the sucrose-degrading enzyme invertase (Mortimer and Hawthorne 1969). Mutants of S. cerevisiae strain S 288 C (SUC 2 +) unable to grow anaerobically on sucrose, but still able to use glucose, were isolated. Two major complementation groups were identified: twenty-four recessive mutations at the SUC 2 locus (suc 2 -); and five recessive mutations defining a new locus, SNF 1 (for sucrose nonfermenting), essential for sucrose utilization. Two minor complementation groups, each comprising a single member with a leaky sucrose-nonfermenting phenotype, were also identified. The suc 2 mutations isolated include four suppressible amber mutations and five mutations apparently exhibiting <b>intragenic</b> complementation; <b>complementation</b> analysis and mitotic mapping studies indicated that all of the suc 2 mutations are alleles of a single gene. These results suggest that SUC 2 encodes a protein, probably a dimer or multimer. No invertase activity was detected in suc 2 mutants. —The SNF 1 locus is not tightly linked to SUC 2. The snf 1 mutations were found to be pleiotropic, preventing sucrose utilization by SUC 2 + and SUC 7 + strains, and also preventing utilization of galactose, maltose and several nonfermentable carbon sources. Although snf 1 mutants thus display a petite phenotype, classic petite mutations do not interfere with utilization of sucrose, galactose or maltose. A common feature of all the carbon utilization systems affected by SNF 1 is that all are regulated by glucose repression. The snf 1 mutants were found to produce the constitutive nonglycosylated form of invertase, but failed to produce the glucose-repressible, glycosylated, secreted invertase. This failure cannot be attributed to a general defect in production of glycosylated and secreted proteins because synthesis of acid phosphatase, a glycosylated secreted protein not subject to glucose repression, was not affected by snf 1 mutations. These findings suggest that the SNF 1 locus is involved in the regulation of gene expression by glucose repression...|$|R

Transvection can sometimes be restored in a translocation homozygote, where both alleles may once again be able to pair. Restoration of phenotype has been observed at bithorax, decapentaplegic, eyes absent, and vestigial, and with transgenes of white. In some cases, transvection between two alleles leads to <b>intragenic</b> <b>complementation</b> while disruption of transvection disrupts the complementation.|$|E

In vivo as in vitro, the NADH-nitrate reductase (NR) activity in plants heterozygous for two different nia alleles was lower than in the wild type plant, but the plants were able to grow on nitrate as a sole nitrogen source. NR activity, absent in extracts of homozygous nia mutants was restored by mixing extracts from two complementing nia mutants. These observations suggest that NR <b>intragenic</b> <b>complementation</b> results from either the formation of heteromeric NR or from the interaction between two modified enzymes. Complementation was only observed between mutants retaining different partial catalytic activities of the enzyme. Results are in agreement with molecular data suggesting the presence of three catalytic domains in the subunit of the enzyme...|$|E
40|$|<b>Intragenic</b> <b>complementation</b> {{has been}} {{observed}} at the argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) locus. <b>Intragenic</b> <b>complementation</b> is a phenomenon that occurs when a multimeric protein is formed from subunits produced by different mutant alleles of a gene. The resulting hybrid protein exhibits enzymatic activity that is greater than that found in the oligomeric proteins produced by each mutant allele alone. The mutations involved in the most successful complementation event observed in ASL deficiency {{were found to be}} an aspartate to glycine mutation at codon 87 of one allele (D 87 G) coupled with a glutamine to arginine mutation at codon 286 of the other (Q 286 R). To understand the structural basis of the Q 286 R:D 87 G <b>intragenic</b> <b>complementation</b> event at the ASL locus, we have determined the x-ray crystal structure of recombinant human ASL at 4. 0 Å resolution. The structure has been refined to an R factor of 18. 8 %. Two monomers related by a noncrystallographic 2 -fold axis comprise the asymmetric unit, and a crystallographic 2 -fold axis of space group P 3121 completes the tetramer. Each of the four active sites is composed of residues from three monomers. Structural mapping of the Q 286 R and D 87 G mutations indicate that both are near the active site and each is contributed by a different monomer. Thus when mutant monomers combine randomly such that one active site contains both mutations, it is required by molecular symmetry that another active site exists with no mutations. These “native” active sites give rise to the observed partial recovery of enzymatic activity...|$|E
40|$|The agouti locus (A) of {{the mouse}} determines the timing and type of pigment {{deposition}} in the growing hair bulb, and several alleles at this locus are lethal when homozygous. Apparent instances of <b>intragenic</b> recombination and <b>complementation</b> between different recessive lethal alleles {{have suggested that the}} locus has a complex structure. We have begun to investigate the molecular basis of agouti gene action and recessive lethality by using a series of genetically linked DNA probes and pulsed field gel electrophoresis to detect structural alterations in radiation-induced agouti mutations. Hybridization probes from the Src and Emv- 15 loci do not reveal molecular alterations in DNA corresponding to the a(e), a(x), and a(l) alleles, but a probe from the parotid secretory protein gene (Psp) detects a 75 -kilobase (kb) deletion in DNA containing the non-agouti lethal allele (a(l)). The deletion is defined by a 75 -kb reduction in the size of BssHII, NotI, NruI and SacII high molecular weight restriction fragments detected with the Psp probe and is located between 25 kb and 575 kb from Psp coding sequences. Because the genetic distance between A and Emv- 15 is much less than A and Psp, there may be a preferred site of recombination close to Psp, or suppression of recombination between A and Emv- 15. The a(l) deletion has allowed us to determine the genotype of mice heterozygous for different recessive lethal alleles. We find that three different recessive lethal complementation groups are present at the agouti locus, two of which are contained within the a(l) deletion...|$|R
40|$|Studies of a {{wide variety}} of organisms have shown that {{homologous}} sequences can exert a significant impact on each other, resulting in changes in gene sequence, gene expression, chromatin structure, and global chromosome architecture. Our work has focused on transvection, a process that can cause genes to be sensitive to the proximity of a homologue. Transvection is seen at the yellow gene of Drosophila, where it mediates numerous cases of <b>intragenic</b> <b>complementation.</b> In this article, we describe two approaches that have characterized the process of transvection at yellow. The first entailed a screen for mutations that support <b>intragenic</b> <b>complementation</b> at yellow. The second involved the analysis of 53 yellow alleles, obtained from a variety of sources, with respect to complementation, molecular structure, and transcriptional competence. Our data suggest two ways in which transvection may be regulated at yellow: (1) a transcriptional mechanism, whereby the ability of an allele to support transvection is influenced by its transcriptional competency, and (2) a structural mechanism, whereby the pairing of structurally dissimilar homologues results in conformational changes that affect gene expression...|$|E
40|$|Methylmalonic aciduria (MMA) is an {{autosomal}} recessive metabolic disorder with an incidence of 1 in 48, 000, {{which may be}} due to a defect in the mitochondrial homodimeric enzyme methylmalonyl CoA mutase (mut MMA). mut MMA is subdivided into $mut sp circ$ and $mut sp-$ subclasses on the basis of complementation analysis; $mut sp circ$ cell lines have very low incorporation of ($ sp{ 14 }$C) from propionate into acid precipitable material while incorporation in $mut sp-$ cells is increased when cells are incubated in cobalamin. <b>Intragenic</b> <b>complementation</b> was first observed with WG 1130, a $mut sp circ$ fibroblast line with a homozygous R 93 H mutation, that is capable of complementing MCM activity when fused with some $mut sp circ$ and some $mut sp-$ cells (1). Extensive <b>intragenic</b> <b>complementation</b> in mut MMA was subsequently observed. Fibroblasts cultured from thirteen unrelated patients (6 $mut sp-$, 7 $mut sp circ$) were fused in all possible pairwise combination and MCM activity was assayed in the heterokaryons by measuring the incorporation of ($ sp{ 14 }$C) from propionate into acid precipitable material. <b>Intragenic</b> <b>complementation,</b> indicated by stimulation of ($ sp{ 14 }$C) -propionate incorporation following cell fusion with polyethylene glycol, was observed in fusions involving twelve of the thirteen strains.

40|$|Deficiency of argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) causes argininosuccinic aciduria, an urea cycle defect {{that may}} present {{with a severe}} {{neonatal}} onset form or with a late onset phenotype. To date phenotype-genotype correlations are still not clear because biochemical assays of ASL activity correlate poorly with clinical severity in patients. We employed a yeast-based functional complementation assay to assess the pathogenicity of 12 missense ASL mutations, to establish genotype-phenotype correlations, and to screen for <b>intragenic</b> <b>complementation.</b> Rather than determining ASL enzyme activity directly, we have measured the growth rate in arginine-free medium of a yeast ASL(null) strain transformed with individual mutant ASL alleles. Individual haploid strains were also mated to obtain diploid, "compound heterozygous" yeast. We show that the late onset phenotypes arise in patients because they harbor individual alleles retaining high residual enzymatic activity or because of <b>intragenic</b> <b>complementation</b> among different mutated alleles. In these cases complementation occurs because in the hybrid tetrameric enzyme at least one active site without mutations can be formed or because the differently mutated alleles can stabilize each other, resulting in partial recovery of enzymatic activity. Functional complementation in yeast is simple and reproducible and allows the analysis {{of large numbers of}} mutant alleles. Moreover, it can be easily adapted for the analysis of mutations in other genes involved in urea cycle disorders...|$|E

Using gene replacement, we altered two core promoter elements at yellow and tested the resulting alleles for their ability to support transvection.

40|$|AbstractMutations in the PCCA or PCCB genes coding for α and β {{subunits}} of propionyl CoA carboxylase {{can cause}} propionic acidemia. To understand the molecular {{basis of the}} <b>intragenic</b> <b>complementation</b> previously reported at the PCCB locus, we now examine the complementation behaviour of four carboxy-terminal and 11 amino-terminal naturally occurring mutant alleles both using cell fusion and reconstructing the complementation event by transfecting the mutant cDNAs to generate multimeric hybrid proteins. Alleles carrying mutations p. R 410 W and p. W 531 X are able to complement with 10 out of 11 amino-terminal mutations assayed. Only the unstable p. R 512 C, p. L 519 P and p. G 112 D mutants fail to complement. The results analyzed {{in the framework of}} the crystal structure of the homologous 12 S transcarboxylase from Propionibacterium shermanii show that all mutant alleles studied are located at β subunits interfaces, complementing alleles at the inter-trimer interface, where the catalysis probably happens, and non-complementing alleles at the intra-trimer interface, probably disrupting the trimer formation. Our results also show a remarkable stabilization effect when p. R 410 W is cotransfected with p. G 246 V. We propose a model for <b>intragenic</b> <b>complementation</b> requiring the production of two different β subunits carrying carboxy and amino-terminal mutations that allow regenerating functional active sites and in which a stabilization effect between subunits could be relevant to ameliorate the biochemical phenotype of each mutation separately...|$|E
40|$|Temperature-sensitive {{mutations}} {{fall into}} two general classes: those generating thermolabile proteins; and those generating defects in protein synthesis, folding or assembly. Temperature-sensitive mutations at 17 sites in the gene for the coat protein of Phage P 22 are of the latter class, preventing the productive folding of the polypeptide chain at restrictive temperature. We show here that, though the coat subunits interact intimately to form the viral shell, these temperature-sensitive folding (TSF) mutations were all recessive to wild type. The mutant polypeptide chains were not rescued {{by the presence of}} wild-type polypeptide chains. Missense substitutions in multimeric proteins frequently exhibit intragenic complementation; however, all pairs of coat protein TSF mutants tested failed to complement. The recessive phenotypes, absence of rescue and absence of <b>intragenic</b> <b>complementation</b> are all accounted for by the TSF defect, in which destabilization of a folding intermediate at restrictive temperature prevents the mutant chain from reaching the conformation required for subunit/subunit recognition. We suggest that absence of <b>intragenic</b> <b>complementation</b> should be a general property of TSF mutations in genes encoding multimeric proteins. The spectra of new loci identified by isolating second-site suppressors and synthetic lethals of temperature sensitive mutants will also differ depending {{on the nature of the}} defect. In the case of TSF mutations, where folding intermediates are defective rather than the native molecule, the spectra of other genes identified should shift from those whose products interact with the native molecule to those whose products influence the folding process...|$|E
40|$|Site-directed {{mutagenesis}} of the trpR gene (encoding the trp repressor, TrpR) {{was used}} to replace Gly 85 with tryptophan (Trp or W), in order to place Trp near its normal location in the -tryptophan(-W) -binding pocket. The resulting mutant protein (G 85 W) exhibits weak, but significant repressor activity in vivo that is independent {{of the presence of}} -W in the media. This mutant negatively complements the chromosomal wild type (wt), but does not negatively complement either the wt or the super-repressor, E 49 K, when any of these alleles is expressed on a multicopy plasmid. Activity of the mutant repressor, G 85 W, when produced in vivo together with T 44 M, approaches that of the wt repressor. This result presumably reflects complementation between the two mutant polypeptides. Similar results are obtained when G 85 R or G 85 K are combined with T 44 M in vivo, but not when G 85 W is replaced by G 85 E. The level of repression is dependent on the presence of -W in the media. The TrpR with two mutations altering both Gly 85 (G 85 W, G 85 R, G 85 E or G 85 K) and Thr 44 (T 44 M) has no repressor activity. These results suggest a type of site-specific <b>intragenic</b> <b>complementation</b> where only certain alterations at Gly 85 complement T 44 M. In this study, a positive charge or an indole ring appears to be required for the observed <b>intragenic</b> <b>complementation...</b>|$|E

New bio− mutations were induced by exposure of λpbio particles to ultraviolet light. Tests of complementation between such bio−pbio particles and bio− mutant cells divide the bio− mutations into five cistrons: bioA, bioB, bioF, bioC, and bioD.

40|$|AbstractThe RNA-dependent RNA {{polymerase}} of Sendai virus {{consists of}} two subunits, the L and P proteins, where L {{is thought to be}} responsible for all the catalytic activities necessary for viral RNA synthesis. Sequence alignment of the L proteins of a variety of negative-stranded RNA viruses revealed six regions of good conservation, designated domains I–VI, which are thought to correspond to functional domains of the protein. Analysis of a number of site-directed mutants within the six domains of L allowed us to conclude that the activities of the polymerase are not simply compartmentalized and that each domain contributes to multiple steps in viral RNA synthesis. Nevertheless these domains can function in trans since we demonstrate here that <b>intragenic</b> <b>complementation</b> between pairs of coexpressed inactive L mutants can restore viral RNA synthesis on an added template. Although <b>intragenic</b> <b>complementation</b> is typically very inefficient, complementation to restore leader RNA synthesis was surprisingly very efficient for some pairs and complementation of mRNA synthesis and genome replication was less, but still significant. Complementation occurred with L mutants in five of the six domains, the exception being a domain III mutant, and required the cotranslation of the two L mutants. C-terminal truncations deleting up to half of L were capable of restoring transcription of an inactive domain I L mutant at amino acid 379. Oligomerization of L in the polymerase complex was demonstrated directly by the co-immunoprecipitation of differentially epitope-tagged full-length and truncated L proteins. These data are consistent with L protein being an oligomer with multiple independent domains each of which exhibits several functions...|$|E
40|$|In Salmonella enterica, the CobT enzyme {{activates}} {{the lower}} ligand base during {{the assembly of}} the nucleotide loop of adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) and other cobamides. Previously, mutational analysis identified a class of alleles (class M) that failed to restore AdoCbl biosynthesis during <b>intragenic</b> <b>complementation</b> studies. To learn why class M cobT mutations were deleterious, we determined the nature of three class M cobT alleles and performed in vivo and in vitro functional analyses guided by available structural data on the wild-type CobT (CobTWT) enzyme. We analyzed {{the effects of the}} variants CobT(G 257 D), CobT(G 171 D), CobT(G 320 D), and CobT(C 160 A). The latter was not a class M variant but was of interest because of the potential role of a disulfide bond between residues C 160 and C 256 in CobT activity. Substitutions G 171 D, G 257 D, and G 320 D had profound negative effects on the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. The C 160 A substitution rendered the enzyme fivefold less efficient than CobTWT. The CobT(G 320 D) protein was unstable, and results of structure-guided site-directed mutagenesis suggest that either variants CobT(G 257 D) and CobT(G 171 D) have less affinity for 5, 6 -dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB) or access of DMB to the active site is restricted in these variant proteins. The reported lack of <b>intragenic</b> <b>complementation</b> among class M cobT alleles is caused in some cases by unstable proteins, and in others it may be caused by the formation of dimers between two mutant CobT proteins with residual activity that is so low that the resulting CobT dimer cannot synthesize sufficient product to keep up with even the lowest demand for AdoCbl...|$|E

The complex complementation behavior of these mutants found previously in F-prime tests could largely {{be accounted for}} by <b>intragenic</b> <b>complementation</b> and by polarity effects. Mutants of the "cheA" class defined two genes, cheA and cheW, which appeared to be contranscribed. Mutants of the "cheB" class defined four genes, cheX, cheB, cheY, and cheZ, which also constituted a transcriptional unit. Mutants defective in cheA, cheW, cheX, or cheY function swam smoothly, with little or no tumbling, whereas cheB or cheZ mutants exhibited very high tumbling rates.

Altered glutamine synthetase subunits, including nonsense fragments and charge variants, were identified in several of the mutants, indicating that GLN 1 is the structural gene for this enzyme. Negative complementation was observed for almost every allele associated with a protein product and all gln 1 /+ heterozygotes displayed reduced susceptibility to ammonia repression of the remaining glutamine synthetase activity. This latter observation is explained by the hypothesis that ammonia represses the enzyme only through its metabolism to glutamine. A basis for the two gln 1 complementation classes is proposed...|$|E

All six mutations confer a slightly increased resistance to penicillin and rifamycin and a slightly increased sensitivity to sodium dodecyl sulfate.

Remarkably, we found <b>intragenic</b> <b>complementation</b> in group 2 so that group 2 is in fact made up of 3 distinct subgroups.

To determine how our panel of MHV-JHM-derived RNA−ts mutants (Robbet al., 1979) is genetically related to other panels of MHV RNA−ts mutants, we tested our mutants for complementation with representatives from two different sets of MHV-A 59 ts mutants (Koolenet al., 1983; Schaadet al., 1990). These three ts mutant panels together comprise eight genetically distinct complementation groups. Considerable genetic similarity was observed among the three mutant panels. Only three complementation classes are unique to their particular mutant panel, and genetically equivalent mutants were not observed within the other two mutant panels. There are two overlapping complementation groups between the mutant sets derived from MHV-A 59 and four overlapping complementation classes between the MHV-JHM panel and the MHV-A 59 panels. Two complementation groups had representative mutants in all three mutant panels. One of these latter complementation classes demonstrated nonreciprocal complementation patterns consistent with <b>intragenic</b> <b>complementation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Argininosuccinic aciduria is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder of the urea cycle caused by mutations in argininosuccinate lyase (ASL). Two main clinical phenotypes are reported: an acute neonatal form characterised by severe hyperammonaemia and coma, and a subacute, late-onset form which may present with relatively milder neurological symptoms. More than 120 ASL mutations {{have been reported}} so far: the majority are missense, but virtually all types of point mutations are found. Large rearrangements are rare and standard genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis has a high diagnostic yield. Genotype–phenotype correlations {{have been difficult to}} establish as standard biochemical techniques are not sufficiently sensitive to measure residual activity, and other factors such as <b>intragenic</b> <b>complementation,</b> overexpression of nonfunctional ASL transcripts and environmental factors may modulate the phenotype. Clinical manifestations result from the block in the urea cycle and also from impairment of nitric oxide biosynthesis, and the therapy is aimed at restoring these two functions...|$|E
40|$|The Drosophila YA {{protein is}} a nuclear lamina {{component}} whose function {{is essential to}} initiate embryonic development. To identify regions of YA required for its action in its normal cellular context, we made targeted mutations in the YA protein and tested their consequences in flies and embryos in vivo. We found that critical amino acids are distributed {{along the length of}} the YA molecule, with functionally important regions including the N- and the C-terminal ends, the cysteine residues in YA’s two potential zinc fingers, a serine/threonine-rich region, and a potential maturation-promoting factor or mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation target site, ITPIR. In addition, several Ya mutations showed <b>intragenic</b> <b>complementation,</b> with N-terminal mutations complementing C-terminal mutations, suggesting that YA proteins interact with one another. In support of this interaction, we demonstrated by immunoprecipitation that YA molecules are present in complexes with each other. Finally, we showed that the C-terminal 179 amino acids of YA are necessary to target, or retain, YA in the nuclear envelope...|$|E
40|$|Ty 1 retrotransposition in Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{requires}} integrase (IN) -mediated {{insertion of}} Ty 1 cDNA into the host genome. The transposition components are {{assembled in the}} cytoplasm and must cross the nuclear envelope to reach the genomic target, since, unlike animal cell nuclear membranes, the yeast cell nuclear membrane remains intact throughout the cell cycle. We have identified a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) in IN required for Ty 1 transposition (Ty 1 IN) that directs IN to the nucleus. Mutations in the NLS that specifically abolish nuclear localization inactivate transpositional integration but do not affect reverse transcription, protein processing, or catalytic activity in vitro. No additional Ty 1 -encoded proteins are required for IN nuclear localization. <b>Intragenic</b> <b>complementation</b> experiments suggest that Ty 1 IN functions as a multimer and contains two distinct domains, one required for integration {{and the other for}} nuclear localization. Nuclear targeting of the preintegration complex by an IN NLS may prove to be a general strategy used by retrotransposons and retroviruses that infect nondividing cells...|$|E
40|$|Ed Lewis {{introduced}} the term “transvection” in 1954 to describe mechanisms {{that can cause}} {{the expression of a}} gene {{to be sensitive to the}} proximity of its homologue. Transvection since has been reported at an increasing number of loci in Drosophila, where homologous chromosomes are paired in somatic tissues, as well as at loci in other organisms. At the Drosophila yellow gene, transvection can explain <b>intragenic</b> <b>complementation</b> involving the yellow 2 allele (y 2). Here, transvection was proposed to occur by enhancers of one allele acting in trans on the promoter of a paired homologue. In this report, we describe two yellow alleles that strengthen this model and reveal an unexpected, second mechanism for transvection. Data suggest that, in addition to enhancer action in trans, transvection can occur by enhancer bypass of a chromatin insulator in cis. We propose that bypass results from the topology of paired genes. Finally, transvection at yellow can occur in genotypes not involving y 2, implying that it is a feature of yellow itself and not an attribute of one particular allele...|$|E
