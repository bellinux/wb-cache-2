These areas may {{be referred to as}} ground transportation centers or intermodal centers. Amenities at ground transportation centers typically include restrooms and seating, and may also provide ticket counters, food and beverage sales and retail goods such as magazines. Some ground transportation centers have <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>air</b> conditioning and covered boarding areas (to protect passengers from the elements).|$|E

5|$|The {{turbines}} {{were designed}} to operate at 12,500 rpm and were paired with a generator set with a 10:1 reduction gearing. A twin-armature DC generator was used to power the traction motors, while a three-phase, 220-volt AC generator provided auxiliary functions such as powering the traction motor blowers and providing head-end power; the latter, which was used to provide lighting, <b>heating,</b> <b>and</b> <b>air</b> conditioning to passenger cars, was incredibly unusual in 1939 and would not become standard until the 1970s.|$|E

25|$|The final {{building}} {{addition to}} the existing old Kermit High School building was sought in 1982 and the construction was completed in 1983. This new addition included {{the extension of the}} middle hall through {{the south side of the}} building, a new computer lab, the existing front office, a new classroom, and the new upstairs library. In {{addition to the}} building extensions, the ceilings were lowered in order to install new <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>air</b> conditioning systems. During the 1980s, the school competed in mainly the UIL Conference AAA level, and briefly, the UIL Conference AAAA level.|$|E
25|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{appliances}} and uses for gas developed over the years. Gas fires, gas cookers, refrigerators, washing machines, hand irons, pokers for lighting coal fires, gas-heated baths, remotely controlled clusters of gas lights, gas engines of various types and, in later years, gas warm air and hot water central <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>air</b> conditioning, all of which made immense contributions to {{the improvement of the}} quality of life in cities and towns worldwide. The evolution of electric lighting made available from public supply extinguished the gas light, except where colour matching was practised as in haberdashery shops.|$|E
25|$|These concourses were {{constructed}} in 1983 and designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum. The two concourses have 22 gates each, numbered C1-C28 and D1-D32, with odd-numbered gates {{on the north}} side of the building and even numbered gates on the south side. Concourse C composes the eastern half of the terminal and Concourse D composes the gates on the west half of the terminal.

25|$|Although {{the engine}} rooms, boiler rooms and {{machinery}} workshops remain largely in their initial configuration and one officer cabin on the tweendeck was spared {{by the fire}} in the 1940s, the aim of the restoration work was never to return Tarmo to her original condition. Instead, she was rebuilt as she appeared after her last major refit in 1951, although with modern <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>air</b> conditioning systems. Her hold was turned into an exhibition space and a cafeteria was opened in the crew mess. Although she was not repaired to operational condition – her stern engine was decoupled from the propeller shaft and equipped with an electrical turning gear – there are no permanent changes that would prevent her from ever sailing under her own power.|$|E
25|$|Net Zero Energy Building Certification {{launched}} in 2011, {{with an international}} following. The first project, Painters Hall, is Pringle Creek’s Community Center, café, office, art gallery, and event venue. Originally built in the 1930s, Painters Hall was renovated to LEED Platinum Net Zero energy building standards in 2010, demonstrating the potential of converting existing building stock into high‐performance, sustainable building sites. Painters Hall features simple low-‐cost solutions for energy reduction, such as natural daylighting and passive cooling lighting, that save money and increase comfort. A district ground-source geothermal loop serves the building’s GSHP for highly efficient <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>air</b> conditioning. Excess generation from the 20.2kW rooftop solar array offsets pumping for the neighborhoods geo loop system. Open to the public, Painters Hall is a hub for gatherings of friends, neighbors, and visitors {{at the heart of}} a neighborhood designed around nature and community.|$|E

25|$|The {{initial cost}} of an {{incandescent}} bulb is small compared {{to the cost of}} the energy it uses over its lifetime. Incandescent bulbs have a shorter life than most other lighting, an important factor if replacement is inconvenient or expensive. Some types of lamp, including incandescent and fluorescent, emit less light as they age; this may be an inconvenience, or may reduce effective lifetime due to lamp replacement before total failure. A comparison of incandescent lamp operating cost with other light sources must include illumination requirements, cost of the lamp and labor cost to replace lamps (taking into account effective lamp lifetime), cost of electricity used, effect of lamp operation on <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>air</b> conditioning systems. When used for lighting in houses and commercial buildings, the energy lost to heat can significantly increase the energy required by a building's air conditioning system. During the heating season heat produced by the bulbs is not wasted, although in most cases it is more cost effective to obtain heat from the heating system. Regardless, {{over the course of a}} year a more efficient lighting system saves energy in nearly all climates.|$|E
25|$|In late 2007, {{construction}} {{began on}} a large mixed-use residential, office and retail development located {{on the site of}} the old GW Hospital (Square 54) and just east of the Foggy Bottom-GWU Metrorail station. It was the second-largest undeveloped lot in the District of Columbia at the time of initial construction activity. In 2014, the university assumed ownership of the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the oldest private art museum in Washington D.C. and independent college of art and design. The college of art and design became The Corcoran School of the Arts and Design under the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences. The National Gallery of Art will acquire many of the 17,000 pieces of art from the Corcoran and the rest will be donated to other museums around the country. In May 2014, GW opened the Milken Institute School of Public Health, a nine-story building that received LEED certification for sustainability features including a green roof, rainwater collection system and special <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> <b>air</b> conditioning technologies that helps mass air displacement. The Textile Museum reopened to the public in March 2015 after the institution merged with the university in 2011 and closed it for renovations two years later.|$|E
