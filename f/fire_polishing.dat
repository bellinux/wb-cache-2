50|$|The {{physiological}} tube is one-piece vertical feature {{without any}} crossing {{part of the}} pipettes. Any types of pipette with the cross segment included in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal line are required to adjust to circular.Delivering tips of the genre 1 and genre 2 are different. For the genre 1, the capacities of the delivery tips is constructed at the gradual taper between 15 to 30 mm for 5 ml, and  20 to 40 mm for 10 to 50 ml. The genre 2 has a longer distance between  50 to 65 mm from the tip end. The tip end of the pipettes are perpendicular construction to the axis. A unexpected constricted orifice is not acceptable for the genre 2 pipettes. The beveling and <b>fire</b> <b>polishing</b> from the external margin of the tip is essential {{at the end of}} the tube. The position of zero graduation line is important for determining of initiating scale of the pipettes. The requirement for the scale of the graduation line is not less than ninety mm due to the capacities.This includes from the top stop following to all of graduated pipettes. The exception presents only for 0.5 ml pipettes that require not less than eighty mm.The period of the extensions and the discharge have some limitations. Unplugging the pipettes, the out-flowing time is vertically flow according to the utilizing 256 5°C of the distilled water together with the stopwatch. The determination of the discharge time depends on the unrestrained outflow liquid from the zero calibration to the final base. The abstaining of the flowing time can be observed during this period.The standard of marking of all pf is  irreparable and comprehensible.The tracing mark of the graduation is required not to greater than 0.40 mm from the elevation. The starting position of the plane required in perpendicular to the upright position. Etching and filling along an eternal colors can enhance the lines and marking spots.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{a number of}} gas flames for <b>fire</b> <b>polishing</b> borosilicate glass capillaries used in the manufacturing of IVF micro-pipettes. Hydrofluoric acid (HF) was also used {{as an alternative to}} finish the pipette end. Glass micro tools in the IVF industry are drawn from hollow glass capillaries of diameter 1 mm. These capillaries are cut manually to a length of 100 mm from hollow glass rods resulting in sharp and chipped edges. These capillaries are held in a customised holder having padding of soft silicone or rubber. Sharp and uneven edges of these capillaries pick up particles of rubber or soft silicone shavings, rendering them ineffective for IVF treatments. The working range of borosilicate glass is 800 - 1, 200 degrees C. The experiments involved analysis of <b>fire</b> <b>polishing</b> process for borosilicate glass capillaries using candle, butane, propane, 2350 butane propane, oxyacetylene gas flames, finding the optimum distance of the capillary relative to the flame, optimum time for which the capillary should be held in the flame and optimum region of the flame which gives the required temperature range. The results show that 2350 butane propane gas mix is optimum for <b>fire</b> <b>polishing</b> of borosilicate glass capillaries. The paper is concluded by comparing the results of <b>fire</b> <b>polishing</b> with the results of acid polishing, in which HF of 1. 6 % concentration is used to etch the ends of the borosilicate glass pipettes...|$|E

40|$|The {{crystals}} of Pyroceram are randomly oriented {{and highly}} reflective so that standard microscopy techniques are not satisfactory for studying this material. Standard replicating procedures proved difficult to use. New microscopy techniques and procedures have therefore been developed. A method for locating, orienting, and identifying specific areas {{to be viewed}} with an electron microscope is described. This method not require any special equipment. Plastic replicas {{were found to be}} unsatisfactory because of their tendency to adhere to Pryoceram. This caused them to tear when released or resulted in artifacts. Preshadowed silicon monoxide replicas were satisfactory but required a releasing agent. A method of depositing the releasing agent is described. To polish specimens without evidence of fire-polishing, it was found necessary to use a vibratory polishing technique. Chrome oxide was used as the abrasive and either water or kerosene as the lubricant. Vibratory polishing is extremely slow, but surfaces so polished show no evidence of <b>fire</b> <b>polishing,</b> even when examined by electron microscopy. The most satisfactory etching process used for Pyroceram 9608 consisted of a primary etch of 5 milliliters of hydrochloric acid (concentrated), 5 milliliters of hydrogen fluoride (45 percent), and 45 milliliters of water, and a secondary etch with methyl alcohol replacing the water. Best results were obtained with total etching times from 25 to 30 seconds. Staining of the Pyroceram surface with a Sanford's marker was found to be an expedient way to reduce the glare of reflected light...|$|E
40|$|Double-clad silica fibres used in {{high power}} lasers {{typically}} comprise a core doped with a laser active ion, a silica inner-cladding pump guide {{and a low}} refractive index outer polymer coating for protection and low loss pump guidance. For efficient pump absorption in the active-ion doped core, the inner-cladding must be shaped in order to scramble the pump radiation to achieve a high spatial overlap with the core. This shaping is traditionally undertaken via diamond milling of the fibre preform into an octagon or hexagon, leaving a rough surface that is subsequently fire polished. We report on a new approach for shaping the inner-cladding using a CO 2 laser to machine the fibre preform. This process is shown to allow fabrication of novel cladding structures, which include concave and convex surfaces, {{as well as a}} significant increase in the processing speeds and avoids the need for <b>fire</b> <b>polishing</b> prior to fibre drawing. The laser processing set-up (shown in Fig. 1) employs a 100 W 10. 6 µm pulsed CO 2 laser (Coherent G- 100). The beam is passed through a periscope system before being directed vertically down through a focusing lens (f= 100 mm) onto the fibre preform surface. The preform itself is mounted within a rotation stage on an X-Y translation stage. The X stage translates the preform through the laser beam along its length at speeds of up to 300 mm/s, with a slower Y stage utilised for repositioning for raster scanning along the surface. The laser is modulated at up to 3 kHz repetition rates with varying pulse lengths fro...|$|E
40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) at the Savannah River Site vitrifies High Level Waste for {{repository}} internment. The process {{consists of}} three major steps: waste pretreatment, vitrification, and canister decontamination/sealing. The HLW consists of insoluble metal hydroxides (primarily iron, aluminum, magnesium, manganese, and uranium) and soluble sodium salts (carbonate, hydroxide, nitrite, nitrate, sulfate). The pretreatment process acidifies the sludge with nitric and formic acids, adds the glass formers as glass frit, then concentrates the resulting slurry to approximately 50 weight percent (wt%) total solids. This slurry is fed to the joule-heated melter where the remaining water is evaporated followed by calcination of the solids and conversion to glass. The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) is currently assisting DWPF efforts to increase throughput of the melter. As part of this effort, SRNL has investigated methods to increase the solids content of the melter feed to reduce the heat load required to complete the evaporation of water and allow more of the energy available to calcine and vitrify the waste. The process equipment in the facility is fixed and cannot process materials with high yield stresses, therefore increasing the solids content will require that the yield stress of the melter feed slurries be reduced. Changing the glass former added during pretreatment from an irregularly shaped glass frit to nearly spherical beads was evaluated. The evaluation required a systems approach which included evaluations {{of the effectiveness of}} beads in reducing the melter feed yield stress as well as evaluations of the processing impacts of changing the frit morphology. Processing impacts of beads include changing the settling rate of the glass former (which effects mixing and sampling of the melter feed slurry and the frit addition equipment) as well as impacts on the melt behavior due to decreased surface area of the beads versus frit. Beads were produced from the DWPF process frit by <b>fire</b> <b>polishing.</b> The frit was allowed to free fall through a flame, then quenched with a water spray. Approximately 90 % of the frit was converted to beads by this process, as shown in Figure 1. Borosilicate beads of various diameters were also procured for initial testing...|$|E

50|$|Right-Angle weave stitch, {{also known}} as RAW, is an off-loom bead weaving technique. Beads are {{stitched}} together with thread only making right angle turns, hence the name. The result is an almost fabric like piece of beadwork. Right-Angle weave can be woven with either one needle or two. With single needle right-angle weave, the thread path moves in a figure-eight pattern. For double needle right-angle weave, the threads cross each other along the center bead of each stitch as they head in opposite directions. RAW can be formed into flat pieces, tubes, or 3 dimensional figures. There are also variations on the basic stich like cubic right angle weave, or CRAW. Seed beads, <b>fire</b> <b>polished</b> beads and crystal beads are common choices in pieces using right-angle weave.|$|R
