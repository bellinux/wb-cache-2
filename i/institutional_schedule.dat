40|$|A Proposed Methodology for the Analysis and Selection of Alternatives for the Disposition of Surplus Plutonium The nuclear {{states are}} {{currently}} {{involved in the}} development of comprehensive approaches to the long-term storage and management of fissile materials. A major objective of this effort is to provide a framework for prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The evaluation should include non-proliferation, economic, technical, <b>institutional,</b> <b>schedule,</b> environmental, and health and safety issues. The ANRCP has proposed that an evaluation of alternatives be guided by the principles of decision analysis, a logical and formal approach to the solution of complicated problems that are too complex to solve informally. This approach would consist of four steps: 1) identification of alternatives and objectives, 2) estimation of the performance of the alternatives with respect to the objectives, 3) development of values and weights for the objectives, and 4) evaluation of [...] ...|$|E

A major objective of this effort is to provide a framework for US efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. This will entail both the elimination of excess highly enriched uranium and plutonium, and the insurance of the highest standards of safety, security, and international accountability. The Office of Fissile Materials Disposition is supporting an Interagency Working Group that has initiated a comprehensive review of alternatives for plutonium disposition which takes into account non-proliferation, economic, technical, <b>institutional,</b> <b>schedule,</b> environmental, and health and safety issues.

40|$|The Department of Energy Record of Decision (ROD) {{selected}} {{alternatives for}} disposition of surplus, weapons grade plutonium. A major {{objective of this}} decision was to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Other concerns addressed included economic, technical, <b>institutional,</b> <b>schedule,</b> environmental, and health and safety issues. The analysis reported here was conducted in parallel with technical, environmental, and nonproliferation analyses; it uses multiattribute utility theory to combine these considerations {{in order to facilitate}} an integrated evaluation of alternatives. This analysis is intended to provide additional insight regarding alternative evaluation and to assist in understanding the rationale for the choice of alternatives recommended in the ROD. Value functions were developed for objectives of disposition, and used to rank alternatives. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the ranking of alternatives for the base case was relatively insensitive to changes in assumptions over reasonable ranges. The analyses support the recommendation of the ROD to pursue parallel development of the vitrification immobilization alternative and the use of existing light water reactors alternative. 27 refs., 109 figs., 20 tabs...|$|E
40|$|The capital {{development}} program {{is an important}} part of most road budgets, but these allocations are usually determined independently of the preservation p ogram which can be prepared using a pavement management system. This paper develops a rational basis for optimizing the allocations and combining the preparation of the two programs. The approach seeks an economic optimum of minimum total life-cycle costs and other objective functions. Development works are identified in three categories. Functional improvements such as lane widening, upgrading, and curve improvement, can be handled within an expanded network analysis that models traffic flow and geometric improvements. Capacity expansion through additional lanes or carriageway involves feasibility studies done off-line, and network extension through new roads involves long-and medium-term transport planning. Both these can be incorporated as sets of potential projects to be considered in the optimization. Implementation addresses <b>institutional,</b> <b>scheduling</b> and analytical issues. 1...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE To {{evaluate}} feasibility {{and outcome}} of our <b>institutional</b> SIB-IMRT <b>schedule</b> {{in patients with}} anal cancer and to selectively review the literature on different SIB-IMRT schedules. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between 01 / 08 - 06 / 13 25 patients with biopsy proven squamous cell anal cancer were treated in our institution with IMRT. Radiotherapy was delivered in two series using a SIB-IMRT schedule of 45 Gy/ 1. 8 Gy to the primary tumor and adjacent pelvic lymph nodes and 38 Gy/ 1. 52 Gy to elective nodes followed by an IMRT boost of 7 × 2 Gy[*]=[*] 14 Gy to the primary tumor and involved nodes (cumulative prescription dose: 59 Gy). RESULTS Mean follow-up was 20 months (range: 4 - 68). The 2 -year-local control, colostomy-free survival, distant metastases-free survival and overall survival rates were 92 %, 92 %, 92 %, and 88 %, respectively. Grade 3 acute skin toxicity was observed in 6 patients (24 %). No high grade gastrointestinal or urinary acute toxicity occurred. Four patients required more than one day of treatment interruption due to acute toxicity. No grade 3 or higher late sequelae were observed. CONCLUSION We present our institutional SIB-IMRT experience treating patients with anal cancer in two series using moderate single doses from 1. 5 - 2. 0 Gy. Our results, in terms of loco-regional outcome and toxicity, were comparable to other studies. The incidence of treatment interruptions was very low. Therefore this schedule appears to be safe for clinical use...|$|R

Genetic Algorithm is adaptive method that can be used to solve optimization problems, based on the genetic process of biological organisms. The objective of this research is to develop a job scheduling algorithm using genetic algorithm with high exploration processes. To evaluate the proposed scheduling algorithm this study conducted a simulation using GridSim Simulator and a number of different workload. The research found that genetic algorithm get best results when increasing the mutation and these result directly proportional with the increase in the number of job. The paper concluded that, the mutation and exploration process has a good effect on the final execution time when we have large number of jobs. However, in small number of job mutation has no effects...|$|R
40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE) - Office of Fissile Materials Disposition (OFMD) has {{announced}} a Record of Decision (ROD) selecting alternatives for disposition of surplus plutonium. A major {{objective of this}} decision was to further U. S. efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Other concerns that were addressed include economic, technical, <b>institutional,</b> <b>schedule,</b> environmental, and health and safety issues. The technical, environmental, and nonproliferation analyses supporting the ROD are documented in three DOE reports [DOE-TSR 96, DOE-PEIS 96, and DOE-NN 97, respectively]. At the request of OFMD, a team of analysts from the Amarillo National Resource Center for Plutonium (ANRCP) provided an independent evaluation of the alternatives for plutonium that were considered during the evaluation effort. This report outlines the methodology used by the ANRCP team. This methodology, referred to as multiattribute utility theory (MAU), provides a structure for assembling results of detailed technical, economic, schedule, environment, and nonproliferation analyses for OFMD, DOE policy makers, other stakeholders, {{and the general public}} in a systematic way. The MAU methodology has been supported for use in similar situations by the National Research Council, an agency of the National Academy of Sciences. 1 It is important to emphasize that the MAU process does not lead to a computerized model that actually determines the decision for a complex problem. MAU is a management tool that is one component, albeit a key component, of a decision process. We subscribe to the philosophy that the result of using models should be insights, not numbers. The MAU approach consists of four steps: (1) identification of alternatives, objectives, and performance measures, (2) estimation of the performance of the alternatives with respect to the objectives, (3) development of value functions and weights for the objectives, and (4) evaluation of the alternatives and sensitivity analysis. These steps are described below...|$|E
40|$|A six month project under Theme 1 A of the JISC 09 / 02 call {{to produce}} a {{retention}} schedule for records relating to the Personnel Management Function, using the Revised Study of the Records Lifecycle and {{a report on the}} projects methodology and findings. Executive Summary It is a mark {{of the success of the}} Revised Study of the Records Lifecycle that both the JISC Function and Activity Model and Records Retention Schedule advice were adopted with a good degree of success. Both the model and retention advice were found to be sufficient in scope and detail, and issues surrounding the application of advice and development of an <b>institutional</b> <b>schedule</b> centred on interpretation and method (surveying, presentation and role of the schedule). The Function and Activity model has many benefits but the apparent relevance of some functional designations could be misleading if the functioning of the model or the records is not given sufficient attention. The model becomes easier to apply when looked at ‘in the round ’ and with reference to the records retention schedule. The retention advice relating to HR records did not generally conflict with current practice and acted as an important starting point for discussion of retention, filing methods and digital preservation, particularly in the light of the DPA. The depth of surveying and a tension between the need to address issues of duplication, version control, filing method and potential electronic document management (requiring a good understanding of workflow and the current filing/retention of documents and series) and the need for a schedule not to simply reflect current practice in detail but provide guidance to move systems forward is a common theme addressed in the report. It was decided that the retention schedule should not be a static document or one that sits in isolation from other information and management resources. The project flags ways in which the schedule can be integrated at strategic and practical levels whilst highlighting some of the organisational issues faced in beginning an institutional schedul...|$|E
40|$|This {{descriptive}} and qualitative study aimed {{to analyze the}} process of nursing work in an institution of Indigenous health attention. The investigation was developed at Support House to Indians in Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil. During the data collection step, observation {{of the process of}} working was performed; as well field journal was used in order to register the observations. Also, semi structured interviews were done with ten nursing workers. The data were analyzed using thematic content analysis from the theoretical perspective of work process in health care. We identified two thematic categories: relational tools needed in the care of the Indigenous people; schedule and registration as the central element of the production process of care. The workers reported the importance to use the soft technology to take care. However, there are elements of process of work, as <b>scheduling,</b> <b>institutional</b> norms, and the logic of biomedical model which interpose into the care...|$|R

40|$|Affecting workload, daily {{routines}} and tasks, a ship’s schedule shapes {{life and work}} on board. Characteristics of ships’ schedule have also been associated with fatigue. Fatigue comes not only with high personal costs for seafarers with regard to health and well-being. It also contributes to errors and accidents at sea, with substantial financial implications for the shipping industry. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine seafarers’ perceptions of the consequences of ships’ schedules, and their ways of coping with demanding schedules. Particular attention will be given to effects on fatigue, and the role of social relations. Data come from interviews and informal conversations with officers and crew on cargo ships engaged in short sea shipping, mainly in northern Europe and the Mediterranean. Whereas previous research has mostly focused on assessing the effects of selected stressors, the interviews provided a more nuanced understanding of how ships’ schedules and social interactions on board affected fatigue, and revealed the complex interrelations between ships’ <b>schedules,</b> <b>institutional</b> and organizational context, social interactions on board, and coping strategies. Further, the interviews suggested the importance of considering not only stressors, but also potential mitigating factors and resources for coping. Initial findings suggested that the ship’s schedule was not only an important stressor, but could also undermine the resources available for coping...|$|R
40|$|The {{aviation}} {{business has}} gone through a process of radical restructuring during the latest decades. De-regulation and fierce competition from low-cost carriers have put traditional flag carriers under pressure, resulting in falling fares. In this cost cutting process, service quality aboard has in many cases fallen {{at the same time as}} the glamorous image of aviation partly remains. This process has resulted in a number of contradictions. The purpose of this article is to make a genealogical investigation of hospitality in aviation, in order to explain how the performance and image of hospitality have developed over time and thereby shed some light over contemporary developments. It is argued that the service culture of passenger aviation has two historical roots; both of which developed in distinct social and <b>institutional</b> settings. Traditional <b>scheduled</b> aviation developed out of first class rail service and marine traditions coming from the passengers steam liners of the early 20 th century. Low-cost aviation on the other hand developed out of the charter industry, which in turns goes back to tour operators using buses and coaches. These two traditions have shaped different sets of expectations and relations to service aboard an aircraft. This historic perspective builds on a combination of social, geographic, economic, institutional and technological factors influencing the development of hospitality in aviation...|$|R

We aimed to systematically review psychological therapies with mental health outcomes in prisoners and qualitatively summarise difficulties in conducting randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Methods Prisoners worldwide have substantial mental health needs, but the efficacy of psychological therapy in prisons is unknown. We aimed to systematically review psychological therapies with mental health outcomes in prisoners and qualitatively summarise difficulties in conducting randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Results In 37 identified studies, psychological therapies showed a medium effect size (0. 50, 95 % CI [0. 34, 0. 66]) {{with high levels of}} heterogeneity with the most evidence for CBT and mindfulness-based trials. Studies that used no treatment (0. 77, 95 % CI [0. 50, 1. 03]) or waitlist controls (0. 71, 95 % CI [0. 43, 1. 00]) had larger effect sizes than those that had treatment-as-usual or other psychological therapies as controls (0. 21, 95 % CI [0. 01, 0. 41]). Effects were not sustained on follow-up at 3 and 6 months. No differences were found between group and individual therapy, or different treatment types. The use of a fidelity measure was associated with lower effect sizes. Qualitative analysis identified difficulties with follow-up and <b>institutional</b> constraints on <b>scheduling</b> and implementation of trials. Conclusions. CBT and mindfulness-based therapies are modestly effective in prisoners for depression and anxiety outcomes. In prisons with existing psychological therapies, more evidence is required before additional therapies can be recommended. </p...|$|R
40|$|Federal {{military}} installations often receive electric utility service under ``special`` rate schedules designed for large government and <b>institutional</b> facilities. These <b>schedules</b> {{are intended to}} be financially beneficial to the government when compared with rates offered to large non-federal customers. Past experience, however, indicates that this {{may not always be}} the case. Determining the applicability and cost-effectiveness of alternative rate schedules is a complicated process requiring the analysis of utility bills and computer simulation of diurnal load data and utility rate structures. A layer of complexity is added if the federal installation receives service from more than one electric utility and is considering consolidated billing. In 1993, under a project with the Air Force, Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) examined the possibility of developing a methodology to facilitate the evaluation of alternative rate schedules. To meet the objectives of this project, PNL performed two tasks as follows: Task 1, PNL developed a proof-of-concept prototype computer program (RateSET) that compares the costs under a government rate schedule to those back-calculated under an alternative rate schedule. The program was used to recreate the structure of both rate schedules and then to process 24 monthly billing statements and the associated 30 -minute demand data for the two year period. For the initial test case, actual data were used from a large US Army Forces Command installation located in Georgia. Task 2, PNL then reviewed the tariff packages for each of the major electric utilities providing service to Shaw Air Force Base in Sumter, South Carolina. The primary objective of this alternative rate schedule screening and evaluation process was to characterize the process itself, identify problem areas, and develop a workable approach to use in future similar evaluations...|$|R

Middle school educators are faced with the challenge of meeting both social-emotional and academic needs of their students. With the pressing demands of meeting state standards and No Child Left Behind (NCLB), some teachers find themselves focusing more on the academic needs of their students, whereas other teachers are focused on the social-emotional needs of their students. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine how a select middle school team addresses both academic rigor and social competence. A qualitative case study was utilized to offer rich description of how to balance academic rigor and social competence through teaming efforts and explore the challenges a select team of middle school teachers encounters when achieving a balance. The case consisted of a select team of eighth grade teachers, Team A (pseudonym), at Roosevelt Middle School (pseudonym) in District 268 (pseudonym) located in a Midwest suburb. Team A consisted of five academic teachers and one special education teacher, and 113 students (44 females, 69 males), including 29 who receive special education services. Roosevelt Middle School, a nationally recognized middle school, is one of five middle schools in District 268, a unit school district serving students kindergarten through twelfth grade. Observations, document collection, semi-structured interviews, and a focus group were employed in an effort to examine practices of effective interdisciplinary teaming as the teachers integrate academic rigor and social competence to meet the needs of their young adolescent students. In order to establish trustworthiness, the researcher demonstrated credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability. Reoccurring themes pertaining to the research questions that emerged from the data collection are outlined and detailed through narratives. This study is significant because it supports Dewey's notion of false dualism and current research regarding the effectiveness of teaming at the middle school level. The findings suggest Team A is able to integrate academic rigor and social competence by utilizing a variety of teaching strategies, implementing collaborative learning, promoting self-directed learners, applying classroom concepts to life, and fostering communication and relationships. The combined efforts of the team facilitate the balance of academic rigor and social competence. The Team A teachers are guided by strong leadership, offer each other support, share similar philosophies, receive support from parents, and integrate special events. In addition, the findings propose that Team A encounters challenges such as the lack of time and the institutional structure when balancing academic rigor and social competence. These findings have implications for middle school principals, teams, teachers, and teacher preparation programs. Most importantly, middle schools should utilize teaming efforts. Principals should take into account teachers' teaching philosophies when forming teams and assign teams a strong leader. In addition, principals should consider the <b>institutional</b> structure (<b>schedule,</b> classroom assignments, team space) and its impact on teachers and students. Teams should share their philosophies, invite parents to get involved, promote self-directed learning, and utilize flex scheduling. Furthermore, middle school teachers should promote collaborative learning, apply academic concepts to the lives of their students, foster relationships with their students, support their teammates, and utilize special events. Finally, teacher preparation programs should prepare preservice teachers in a manner that will encourage them to take an active role on a team and integrate academic rigor and social competence...|$|R
40|$|Increasing aging populations, {{establishes}} challenges globally {{regarding the}} maintenance of a meaningful life of old people in different settings. Everyday life for older adults living in nursing homes (here called residents) is often strongly influenced by their institutional context. Furthermore this context affects residents’ possibilities of influencing and shaping their everyday occupations. Conventional activity programs in nursing home settings have traditionally applied uniform events for all (e. g. chair exercises, ball games, bingo) scheduled to fulfill local policy goals, fit <b>institutional</b> and staff <b>schedules</b> and having little grounding and resonance in the residents’ occupational preferences and interests. This paper presents empirically based knowledge on how actualization of potentiality can be enacted through everyday life events and how the residents negotiate and struggle with the institutional culture in order to have access to meaningful everyday occupations. We use the concept of potentiality(Agamben, 1999; Asaba 2 ̆ 6 Wicks, 2010) based on the understanding that the exercise of latent power might bring about change in everyday life just in orchestration with the context, and that occupations have a pivotal role on this. Contextual aspects can inhibit occupational opportunities, or open up scenarios to play out the residents’ potentiality. The aim of the study is to explore how participation and potentiality can be unfolded and enacted in everyday occupations within a nursing home context. The study had an ethnographic design in nursing home settings and used multiple narratives methods(Alsaker, Bongaardt, 2 ̆ 6 Josephsson, 2009; Lawlor 2 ̆ 6 Mattingly, 2001). Preliminary findings shows a strong tension between residents potentiality and the institutional culture, constituting even risk for occupational deprivation 1) Everyday life of the residents is characterized by a struggle between institutional culture multiple values and residents values. 2) Stereotype understandings of meaningful occupation in everyday life are promoted, and 3) the residents experience a lack of continuity from previous meaningful life. 4) Lack of access to different opportunities and resources to acknowledge individual differences in the occupations people want and need to engage in (Stadnyk, Townsend, 2 ̆ 6 Wilcock, 2010). Conclusively, the actualization of potentiality in everyday life might contribute to empowerment of the residents in institutional setting, however the institutional culture plays a crucial role regarding the actualization of it.
