50|$|New York master {{building}} planner Robert Moses {{had always}} been a vocal critic of Coney Island, likening the crowds that flocked there during the summer months to the crowds of New Yorkers that flooded the city's tenement houses. Moses had since the 1930s tried to redevelop the island into serene park land. To prevent the proliferation of the amusement area, he had the New York Aquarium relocate to the old Dreamland site in 1957. In the late 1940s Moses would take on the title of city housing commissioner. He targeted Coney for redevelopment by building a series of high-rise low-income housing developments in the late 1950s. This decimated the Coney Island neighborhood around Steeplechase and the remaining amusements. The relocation of many low-income families to Coney eventually led to a sharp <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> <b>in</b> the area. By the early 1960s patrons of Steeplechase began avoiding the area, preferring parks in safer areas such as Rockaway Playland in Rockaway Beach and Rye Playland in Rye, New York.|$|R
30|$|Arguments from {{complex systems}} theory and from urban {{economics}} emphasize the role <b>of</b> agglomeration economies <b>in</b> all these processes: {{the output of}} socioeconomic processes rises on a per capita basis {{with the size of}} cities.

However, many cities are experiencing <b>increased</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> <b>in</b> their alcohol-oriented entertainment districts. This paper explores <b>crime</b> <b>in</b> Northbridge entertainment district in Perth, Western Australia and highlights how the legacy of governance can operate counter-intuitively, to foster crime precipitators (Wortley, 2008), which can increase opportunities for crime. Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) and Situational Crime Prevention (SCP) are briefly discussed and the authors argued that SCP is a more appropriate strategy to use in the dynamic and complex environmental setting of Northbridge. Based on several years of scientific observation, land-use surveys and pedestrian surveys, the authors provide a critical narrative of Northbridge and crime precipitators after dark. This narrative is expressed from the perspective of environmental criminology and SCP. This exploratory study concludes that Northbridge is in part, a legacy of previous single-issue governance, which has inadvertently created crime precipitators, which exacerbate the problems <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> <b>in</b> the entertainment district after dark.

Some American Jewish leaders, who were working with Baron de Hirsch in Europe to help their Russian co-religionists, had supported White's appointment in a direct appeal to the President, and they urged White to look fully into the situation.

Such an act is done due to the structural pressure which depresses the people in accessing the natural resources that support their lives. This structural pressure kept increasing in the rural areas of Rembang {{by the end of the}} 19 th century, particularly after the issuance of the law on forestry in 1865 that enabled the forestry capitalism to be established. The limitation in the people’s access to the state forest as the manifestation of the domain concept and the exploitation of the teak forests done by the private businessmen became the trigger to the <b>increasing</b> acts <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> <b>in</b> the rural areas of Rembang. The scarcity of the local economic resources due to such natural factors as barren land and structural factors as the result of the penetration of the external power became the main trigger to the social banditry to take place in Rembang.

The growing number of militias and racial extremist in this country, that are advocating violence and the overthrow of our government, will demand that in the 21 st century {{the military}} will have to look inward to meet a domestic threat. Background: The 1990 _s have seen a large <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the number <b>of</b> Militias, Patriot movements, and religiously founded extremist, both black and white, in America. It is estimated that there are over 441 militias and 368 Patriot groups, involving by some accounts, up to five million people. The main drive behind these movements has been a growing dissatisfaction with how our government is being run and economic hardship. Most of the Militias have formed because of the fear that the United States government is being {{taken over by the}} United Nations {{under the auspices of the}} "new world order. " The members of the militia feel they must stand up their armies and stop the take over, to protect our country. Two recent events have fueled the fires of militia mania. They are: the stand off at Ruby Ridge, Idaho and the attack on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas. Unfortunately the threats of violence are no longer just talk as shown by the Oklahoma City bombing, and the <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> militia involvement <b>in</b> <b>crime</b> to support their cause...|$|R
40|$|In their seminal "Broken Windows" {{article in}} Atlantic Monthly, J. Q. Wilson and G. L. Kelling (1982) {{suggested}} that police could more effectively fight crime by targeting minor offenses. They hypothesized that untended disorder <b>increases</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> <b>in</b> a community, starting {{a chain of}} events that eventually leads to heightened levels of crime. By targeting disorder, police can thus circumvent this cycle of neighborhood decline (Skogan, 1990). This study aimed to improve knowledge of the relationship between disorder and fear <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> <b>in</b> the context <b>of</b> the broken windows hypothesis by using a micro-place level research design involving a police crackdown on disorder and minor crime at hot spots. The results of the current study suggest that perceived social disorder and observed levels of physical disorder have a strong impact on fear of crime. This confirms the relationship between disorder and fear hypothesized by the broken windows literature, and implies that police may be able to reduce fear of crime by reducing disorder. It was also found, however, that the police intervention itself significantly <b>increased</b> the probability <b>of</b> feeling unsafe. Accordingly, any fear reduction benefits gained by reducing disorder may be offset {{by the fact that the}} policing strategies employed simultaneously <b>increase</b> fear <b>of</b> crime. These findings suggest the importance of a careful focus on "how" broken windows policing programs are implemented. Such programs must be geared not only to reduce disorder, but also to prevent increases in citizen fear that accompany crackdowns and other intensive enforcement efforts associated with broken windows policing. ...|$|R
40|$|Chapter 1 and 2 {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the Legal Service Program on crime and divorce by using the roll-out of legal service grants to evaluate empirically the effects of the legal services program on reported crime as well as other economic outcomes. Chapter 1 shows that there is a short run <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> 7 percent <b>in</b> <b>crimes</b> reported and 13 percent <b>in</b> <b>crimes</b> cleared by arrest. Further analysis provides evidence that the increase <b>in</b> reported <b>crime</b> is mostly driven by changes in reporting after subsidized legal service become available as opposed to an increase <b>in</b> actual <b>crime.</b> These cities are also associated with having better police relationships with the poor as well as higher median property values by 1980. Using the Vital Statistics from 1960 to 1988, chapter 2 shows that there is a short run <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> 6 percent <b>in</b> the divorce rates in counties that receive legal service grants. The increase in divorce translate to an average treatment effect on the treated of 124 divorces per 100, 000 poor residents. Also results show a convergence <b>of</b> divorce rates <b>in</b> long run that reflect changes in social norms about divorce. The large treatment effect is consistent with the political debate surrounding the program as well as legal services lawyers’ reflection on the volume of caseloads devoted towards family matters. Chapter 3 uses new mayoral election data to analyze implications of election cycles on changes <b>in</b> the size <b>of</b> the police force. According to estimates, election years are associated with a 2 percent increase in the number police officers available.
