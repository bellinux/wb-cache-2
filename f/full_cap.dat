5|$|The {{rules of}} ODIs {{have changed since}} the first Afro-Asia Cup. During the tournament, the ICC experimented with a rule called supersub – where the twelfth man {{would be allowed to}} take to the field in the place of one of the players and would be allowed to bat and/or bowl in his place, gaining a <b>full</b> <b>cap</b> in the process. As a result this meant there were {{generally}} 12 capped players per match instead of the regular 11, even though a player may have not participated in either batting or bowling in a match. For example, Muttiah Muralitharan bowled during the first innings of the first ODI, but was replaced by Mohammad Ashraful who batted in his place: both players are listed as having a <b>full</b> <b>cap.</b> These rules were not in place for the World Cricket Tsunami Appeal match or the 2007 Afro-Asia Cup.|$|E
5|$|Liddell debuted for Scotland in a 5–4 wartime {{win over}} England at Hampden Park, {{equalising}} Tommy Lawton's opening goal. He gained several more wartime caps. He gained his first <b>full</b> <b>cap</b> against Switzerland scoring {{twice in a}} 3-1 win at Hampden Park on 15 May 1946 At international level, Liddell played predominantly as an outside left, in competition with Scotland-based Lawrie Reilly and Willie Ormond. The Scottish Football Association (SFA) denied Liddell and his teammates {{the opportunity to participate}} in the 1950 World Cup, hosted by Brazil, because of an earlier decision not to sanction involvement as British Home Championship runners-up. The decision meant qualification depended on the final match against England on 25 May 1950, which Scotland lost 1-0 when joint-first needed only a draw. Despite pressure from players, the SFA maintained its position.|$|E

25|$|On 14 August 1971, Keegan {{made his}} Liverpool debut against Nottingham Forest at Anfield, scoring after 12 minutes. Although {{originally}} {{signed as a}} midfielder, his ability soon prompted manager Bill Shankly to employ Keegan upfront as a partner for John Toshack. His move to Liverpool also alerted England to his presence, and the forward made his debut at under-23 level later in 1971. His full debut came 12 months after arriving in Liverpool, in a World Cup qualifier against Wales at Ninian Park. Keegan's first goal for his country also came {{in a game against}} Wales in Cardiff.
