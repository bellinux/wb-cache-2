5|$|In September 2013, {{the first}} playable alpha version of Mini Metro was released. They {{decided to keep}} the web version of the game freely available, {{at least until the}} release of the final game. They also {{submitted}} Mini Metro on Steam Greenlight, a community voting system that allows games to be released on digital <b>distribution</b> <b>service</b> Steam. Initially, they intended on releasing {{the final version of the}} game by the end of 2013, however despite the game's limited scope, development took far longer than they had expected. A graphical overhaul, issues within the game's balance, and scheduling someone to work on the game's audio contributed to its delay. In August 2014, they decided to release an in-development version of the game commercially through Steam Early Access. They felt that the early access model was suitable for Mini Metro because the game was designed to have replay value and there was no fixed narrative to be spoiled. They continually released new builds of the game based on the community's feedback. The early access release provided them with funds to work full-time on the game. Peter Curry had been working on Mini Metro full-time since March 2014, and his brother Robert started working full-time in November 2014. Originally Mini Metro was being built for mobile platforms, however they shifted their focus to desktop PCs because of the ability to release their game in the early access state.|$|E
5|$|Monte Testaccio has {{provided}} archaeologists {{with a rare}} insight into the ancient Roman economy. The amphorae deposited in the mound were often labelled with tituli picti, painted or stamped inscriptions which record information such as {{the weight of the}} oil contained in the vessel, the names of the people who weighed and documented the oil {{and the name of the}} district where the oil was originally bottled. This has allowed archaeologists to determine that the oil in the vessels was imported under state authority and was designated for the annona urbis (distribution to the people of Rome) or the annona militaris (distribution to the army). Indeed, some of the inscriptions found on mid-2nd century vessels at Monte Testaccio specifically record that the oil they once contained was delivered to the praefectus annonae, the official in charge of the state-run food <b>distribution</b> <b>service.</b> It is possible that Monte Testaccio was also managed by the praefectus annonae.|$|E

Using firm-level data on Japanese multinationals in the wholesale and retail sectors, this paper examines foreign direct investment (FDI) decisions of distribution firms for local <b>distribution</b> <b>services</b> at the extensive and intensive margin. Consistent with the model of heterogeneous firms on multinational production, productive multinationals are more likely than less productive ones to enter a larger number of markets, penetrate less attractive markets, and generate larger sales per market. While {{these findings are consistent with}} previous evidence on manufacturing multinationals, there are some distinctive determinants of FDI in <b>distribution</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R
