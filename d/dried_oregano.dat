40|$|The review {{highlights}} {{the role of}} antioxidants in minimizing oxidative changes that may adversely {{affect the quality of}} meat and meat products, cause changes in their testing and nutritional properties. This applies particularly to the use of natural antioxidants based on plant extracts, which can be a good alternative to traditional antioxidants, thanks to its high content of phenolic compounds. From the literature it can be concluded that extracts of broccoli, rosemary, mint, grape seed and green tea have a significant antioxidant effect in the meat products. Broccoli and grape seeds extracts have a pronounced antioxidant activity compared to synthetic antioxidants. Laminarin/fucoidan extracts have prooxidative effect on lipid perperoxidation. Essential oils of L. angustifolia and M. piperita effectively inhibit E. coli O 157 :H 7 and S. aureus in the chopped beef meat. The alcoholic extract of the <b>dried</b> leaves of <b>oregano</b> has the highest content of total phenols, however, does not exhibit antioxidant properties.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is the role of diet as a source of {{exposure}} to toxic elements for residents of the El Paso-Juárez border region. Diet is always a potential source of toxic elements. Research data suggest a relationship between prolonged low-dose exposure and a variety of illnesses. Although the United States food industry is among the most carefully regulated in the world from a consumer health standpoint, actual field checking of products is limited. ^ As part of this study, a “Border Basket” was formulated, consisting of the foods most frequently consumed in this region. The “basket” was compiled from grocery store and wholesalers food sales velocity lists, grocery aisle space checks, and food consumption survey questionnaires. Baskets representative of moderate-to-high income, low income, and pregnant woman/child diets were developed. ^ Foods, beverages and medicinal products shown to be popular with residents were analyzed using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Over 750 foods, beverages, medicinals, and cosmetics were analyzed by ICP-MS, using appropriate EPA-approved methods. Direct Current Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (DCP-AES) was used to verify toxic elemental “hits” which were indicated by ICP-MS. In addition, FDA leaches of ceramic ware samples were analyzed using this technique. Ceramic wares, food packaging materials and cosmetics were screened for the presence of toxic elements using x-ray microfluorescence (XRMF) technology. ^ The analytical data were examined for toxic element “hits,” or apparently elevated concentrations. Each of the hits was researched in depth, to determine the probable source of the toxic element, the relative risks associated with the hit, and potential protective measures which could be taken to limit further exposures. ^ With a few exceptions, the study confirmed that the Border Basket diet is generally free of toxic elements. Items of concern included Mexican <b>dried</b> shrimp, Mexican <b>oregano</b> and rue, (a medicinal herb) also known as ruda, lead-glazed ceramic wares, plastic packaging with lead chromate pigments in the labeling, Mexican toys painted with lead-based paints and mercury-filled necklaces. ...|$|R

5000|$|Mexican oregano (Lippia graveolens) {{is not in}} {{the mint}} family, but in the closely related vervain family (Verbenaceae), that {{includes}} e.g. the lemon verbena (Aloysia citrodora). It is a highly studied herb that is said to be of some medical use and is common in curandera (female shamanic practices) in Mexico and the Southwestern United States. The flavor of Mexican oregano has a stronger savory component instead of the piney hint of rosemary flavor in oregano, and its citrus accent might be more aromatic than in oregano. It is becoming more commonly sold outside of Mexico, especially in the United States, where it is an important source of <b>dried</b> <b>oregano.</b> It is sometimes used as a substitute for epazote leaves; this substitution would not work the other way round. Epazote has a lighter, and even more savory flavor and citrus accent than Mexican oregano, and of course, a very strong sweet tarragon-like flavor which might be its strongest component. When Mexican oregano is substituted for epazote, the base flavor less the tarragon-like sweetness is provided, and other corrections to the recipe may cover for the missing tarragon component of epazote, or the dish may be served without that flavor component. If epazote were substituted for Mexican oregano, many dishes would be overpowered by the tarragon accent.|$|E

In Zimbabwe, Busani Bafana investigates how {{restaurants}} use {{herbs and spices}} in their cooking to enhance the flavour in the food. Busani spoke to John Daines, owner of the Art Groove restaurant in Bulawayo, to find out more. As he discovers, if no spices and herbs {{are available in the}} market ? there are no alternatives. Nothing can replace the flavour or the colour that particular herbs and spices have. So, for smallscale farmers who produce them, there is a niche market. The secret is finding out more about it. If you are a smallscale farmer producing herbs and spices for the local market, listen in for a tour around the Art Grove restaurant to spice up your market ? and hear some good tips about what restaurants near you might be after. IN:	?We use both herbs and? OUT:	?fine or a coarse granule. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 54 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That was Busani Bafana speaking to John Daines at the Art Groove restaurant in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. If you are a smallscale farmer producing herbs and spices for local sale, find out what restaurants near you might want. You could see your market improve. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Daines	We use both herbs and spices as ingredients for a lot of our meals to enhance the flavour of our dishes and when we purchase these spices and herbs we look at what is available at the market at the time. Bafana	Where do you buy your dried spices and your herbs? Daines	We buy them wherever we can. Sometimes it is in a supermarket, sometimes it is at a wholesale centre in Bulawayo or often than not we get them in from Harare. Bafana	Is this close to your restaurant?Is this, say, down the road or several kilometres away from your restaurant? Daines	Yes, it can be as close as just around the corner. We buy what we can and what is available at the time. Bafana	What standards, then, do you expect from your suppliers of dried spices and herbs? Daines	From a herb point of view when we are looking at the different herbs that are available we look at the colour and obviously a herb is very much of a green colour because everything is a leaf, whether it can be chives, whether it can be rosemary or oregano, we have mint, herbs like that obviously the brighter and the green, the fresher they are. If they are brown and dull and yellow we know that they have been sitting for an age. And from a spice point of view if we look at something like paprika we are looking at the redness, a strong red colour is absolutely important as opposed to a yellow and orange colour. And the same for if we purchase something like chilli, we look at the hot, the hotness, I do not know if that is good English but we want to burn the mouth when we buy that! If it is dull in flavour we know that it is not of good quality. Bafana	How then have you actually maintained these standards that you talked about? Daines	I think we just use sight and smell really when we look at these products. We know what we are looking for when we are buying and we just make sure that that is what we look for otherwise we just leave it. You know it is really important that we get good quality. Bafana	What opportunities are there for smallscale farmers to supply businesses like yours? Daines	One of the most common herbs that we purchase at this moment is something very simple called mixed herbs and it is just a basic mixture of <b>dried</b> herbs like <b>oregano,</b> marjoram, basil and those types of herbs and that is a very common ingredient to enhance the flavour of whether it is a soup or whether it is a gravy or a sauce or your meat and you actually simply cannot find it at the moment and we find ourselves actually purchasing the individual herb and rubbing and mixing them together. Bafana	What kind of spices and herbs do you buy? Daines	From the herbs I have already mentioned that there is basil, there is oregano, there is mint, there is chives, there is a whole array of herbs that are being used and on the spices side we have what a natural spice is like your paprika, like turmeric which is a root, like cumin, chilli, Bird?s-eye chilli which is the very small chilli which is really, really hot and then we can also get a blend of spices. Bafana	When these certain types of spices and herbs that you mentioned are not available, are there any alternatives? Daines	No, there are no alternatives, you know they enhance the flavour of your food and if it is not there you just have to go without. Bafana	Do you buy in bulk or say even for a month supply or a week?s supply? Daines	It can be like that even longer because you do not know when {{you are going to see}} it next. Bafana	How long have you been buying these products yourself? Daines	Well herbs and spices have been around for generations and I do not think there is not one restaurant or even a household that does not use them. Bafana	What of the packaging of the spices and the herbs and could the packaging influence the reason to buy or not to buy? Daines	Obviously the packaging can play an important part but I think we are not interested in the packaging because all it does is enhances the price. Bafana	What is your advice to smallscale farmers who want to start selling dried spices and herbs but have no clue of where to begin? Daines	I think that a little bit of investigating, they will see that there is a market and they just need to do a little bit of homework. Bafana	I have been interviewing John away from the crowd actually of the restaurant but right now we will actually move into behind the scenes where the food is prepared so I can maybe sample some of these spices. SFX	Kitchen Bafana	We are actually behind the scenes in John?s restaurant, where he prepares the meals, and he is about to explain to us about all the spices that he uses. John, go ahead. Daines	This is a product called turmeric and it is a very much yellow spice as you can see and this is actually made from a root and it is purely used for colour and it has no flavour. Bafana	For what meals do you use it with? Daines	Well very much it is used for curries and spiced Indian food. This one is black peppercorns, this is one that is used everywhere, it is the most simplest spice that we get and it is just basically used as a flavouring. It is left on our tables in the restaurant and it is very much used as an ingredient in our kitchen. Bafana	It has a very strong aroma? There is black pepper and white pepper? Daines	Black and white pepper and I know in South Africa you can get red and green as well just to enhance the colour as well. Bafana	You also feel the texture of the spices? Daines	Not really. Bafana	Not really? Daines	No, everything is ground very finely here and that is what we are looking at so that we don?t see any residue in the product that we are making, so it blends into the meal. Bafana	So tell me, do these spices come already prepared, you don?t grind them yourself here? Daines	Very much they come prepared except, obviously, for the peppercorns, which we can grind ourselves to how we want it, whether it?s a fine or a coarse granule. End of trackSpice up your market with some good tip...|$|R

Convective drying was performed at three tempera-tures: 50, 60 and 70 °C. Hot air velocity was 1 m s- 1. In VM dehydration the pressure in drying chamber was changing from 4 to 6 kPa and three microwave power levels were applied: 240, 360 and 480 W. The decrease in moisture content of oregano dehydrated in convection was described by an exponential func-tion, while in VM method by a linear function in the first drying period and by an exponential function in the second period. Moisture content at the critical point which divides drying curves into two periods was about 1. 4 kg kg- 1 dm regardless of the drying temperature used. The study revealed {{that the increase in}} drying temperature (convective dehydration) and in microwave power (VM) resulted in decreasing of drying time. Freeze drying was the least destructive method of drying because of the antioxidant activity. The most harmful method was convective drying at temperatures of 60 and 70 °C. It was observed that higher phenolic content in <b>dried</b> <b>oregano</b> may be reached by reduction of temperature in convective method or by increasing the microwave power in V-M method.

40|$|One-day-old Cherry valley meat-strain ducks {{were used}} to {{investigate}} the effect of supplemental <b>dried</b> <b>oregano</b> powder (DOP) in feed on the productivity, antioxidant enzyme activity, and breast meat quality. One hundred sixty five ducks were assigned to 5 dietary treatments for 42 days. The dietary treatment groups were control group (CON; no antibiotic, no DOP), antibiotic group (ANT; CON+ 0. 1 % Patrol), 0. 1 % DOP (CON+ 0. 1 % DOP), 0. 5 % DOP (CON+ 0. 5 % DOP), and 1. 0 % DOP (CON+ 1. 0 % DOP). Upon feeding, 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity of oregano extracts was {{higher than that of}} tocopherol, although it was less than that of ascorbic acid. As a result of in vivo study, DOP in the diet showed no effects on final body weight, feed intake, or feed conversion ratio. However, dietary 0. 5 % and 1 % DOP supplementation caused {{a significant increase in the}} serum enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) compared with CON and ANT, while glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in tissue was increased as compared to ANT (p< 0. 05). Cooking loss from ducks fed with DOP decreased compared with the control ducks. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) values of duck breast meat at 5 d post slaughter was found to be significantly reduced in ducks whose diets were supplemented with 0. 5 % and 1 % DOP (p< 0. 05). These results suggest that diets containing 0. 5 % and 1 % DOP may beneficially affect antioxidant enzyme activity of GPx and SOD, improve meat cooking loss, and reduce TBARS values in breast meat at 5 d of storage in ducks...|$|E
40|$|Suitable spice {{inoculation}} procedures using surrogates of Salmonella {{are needed}} to perform adequate validations of spice disinfection processes. In this study, inoculation procedures of <b>dried</b> <b>oregano</b> and onion powder (OP) were developed and standardized using Salmonella, and Pediococcus faecium, as a potential surrogate. The effectiveness of traditional liquid inoculation was compared with dry inoculation of spices using silica and talcum powder (as inert vehicles for the microorganisms). A small amount of inoculated OP was used as starter for inoculation of larger bathes of OP. The stability of the inoculated microorganisms was monitored over time at - 18, 4, and 25 ?C. Salmonella strains isolated from outbreaks associated with spices (SRSS) and nonassociated with spices (non-SRSS) were evaluated to determine their appropriateness to represent the most resistant pathogenic strains during spice desiccation processes. For dry oregano, the final concentrations of SRSS, non-SRSS, and P. faecium were 5. 5, 3. 6, and 4. 2 log CFU/g, respectively, when using a liquid inoculation. When removing 18 % of the oregano?s EO, the concentration of SRSS, non-SRSS, and P. faecium increased to 7. 2, 5. 1, and 6. 4. log CFU/g, respectively; and when removing 58 % of the oregano?s EO, the final counts were 7. 0, 5. 6, and 7. 2 log CFU/g, respectively. Dry inoculation of oregano using pre-inoculated inert powders yielded in silica: 6. 7, 5. 0, and 6. 9 CFU/g, and in talcum: 6. 0, < 3, and 7. 8 log CFU/g of SRSS, non-SRSS, and P. faecium, respectively. For OP, liquid inoculation was not successful since the consistency changed from powdery to clumpy and sticky. However, the OP consistency was maintained when iii inoculating in a 1 : 50 v/w (inocula/OP) ratio. After desiccation, SRSS, non-SRSS, and P. faecium had a reduction of 0. 7, 0. 8, and 0. 0 log CFU/g of SRSS, non-SRSS, and P. faecium. The SRSS showed higher resistance to desiccation than the non-SRSS, whereas P. faecium showed the greatest resistance between the 3 groups of microorganisms. In general, all microorganisms were more stable at - 18 and 4 ?C than at 25 ?C during storage independently of the matrix teste...|$|E
