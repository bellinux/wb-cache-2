Current methods include classical item analysis, differential item functioning (DIF) analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, item response theory, IRT equating, and nonparametric item response theory. The item analysis includes proportion, point biserial, and biserial statistics for all response options. Reliability coefficients include Cronbach's alpha, Guttman's lambda, the Feldt-Gilmer Coefficient, the Feldt-Brennan coefficient, decision consistency indices, the conditional standard error of measurement, and reliability if <b>item</b> <b>deleted.</b> The DIF analysis is based on nonparametric item characteristic curves and the Mantel-Haenszel procedure. DIF effect sizes and ETS DIF classifications {{are included in the}} output. Confirmatory factor analysis is limited to the common factor model for congeneric, tau-equivalent, and parallel measures. Fit statistics are reported along with factor loadings and error variances. IRT methods include the Rasch, partial credit, and rating scale models. IRT equating methods include mean/mean, mean/sigma, Haebara, and Stocking-Lord procedures.|$|E

METHOD Methodological study grounded on self-efficacy theory was conducted in three phases: conceptual and operational definition (review of the literature and interviews with the target population), content validity (opinion of five experts e three clinical nurses), and exploratory factor analysis and internal consistency reliability (cross-sectional survey with a valid sample of 194 nurses). RESULTS A ten-point Likert scale with 40 -item was designed and one item was excluded after review by experts. Three factors emerged from the exploratory factor analysis. The Cronbach's alpha for all items was 0. 983 with item-total correlations in the range 0. 657 to 0. 847. Cronbach's alpha value if <b>item</b> <b>deleted</b> were less than or equal to 0. 983.

40|$|This study disproves the {{following}} six common misconceptions about coefficient alpha: (a) Alpha was first developed by Cronbach. (b) Alpha equals reliability.

(d) Reliability will always be improved by deleting items using alpha if <b>item</b> <b>deleted.</b> (e) Alpha should be greater than or equal to. 7 (or, alternatively,. 8). (f) Alpha is the best choice among all published reliability coefficients. This study discusses the inaccuracy of each of these misconceptions and provides a correct statement. This study recommends that the assumptions of unidimensionality and tau-equivalency be examined before the application of alpha and that structural equation modeling (SEM) -based reliability estimators be substituted for alpha when one of these conditions is not satisfied.

Decisions regarding item reduction and subscale identification were made based {{on a range of}} factors, specified a priori. Items were considered for deletion if they met any of the following criteria: (1) ceiling or floor effect (i.e., items where more than 80 % of the sample endorsed the highest or lowest response options); (2) greater than 5 % missing responses; (3) redundancy as indicated by a particularly high correlation with another item (r[*]>[*] 0.85); (4) lack of relationship to other items as indicated by Cronbach’s alpha with the <b>item</b> <b>deleted</b> (i.e., if alpha increased by >[*] 10 % upon deletion of an item, then that item would have been considered for possible exclusion because it could potentially reduce internal consistency of the scale); and (5) items with insufficient factor loading (i.e., <[*] 0.40) or loading on multiple factors in the factor analysis described below. Additionally, when deciding whether to delete any item, the clinical importance of each item was also considered, based on qualitative research conducted to support development of the questionnaires prior to this psychometric study [19, 20].

40|$|Background Dupuytren’s {{contracture}} is a progressive, fibroproliferative {{disorder that}} causes fixed finger contractures {{and can lead}} to disability. With the advances of new therapeutic interventions, the necessity to assess the functional repercussions of this condition using valid, reliable and sensitive outcome measures is of growing interest. The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) is one frequently used patient-reported outcome measure but its reliability and validity have never been demonstrated specifically for a population affected with Dupuytren’s contracture. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the psychometric properties of the DASH, with focus on validity evidence using the Rasch measurement model. Methods Secondary analysis was performed on data collected as part of a randomised clinical trial. One hundred fifty-three participants diagnosed with Dupuytren’s contracture completed the DASH at four time points (pre-op, 3, 6 and 12 months post-op). Baseline data were analysed using traditional analysis and to test whether they adhered to the expectations of the Rasch model. Post-intervention data were subsequently included and analyzed to determine the effect of the intervention on the items. Results DASH scores demonstrated large ceiling effects at all time points. Initial fit to the Rasch model revealed that the DASH did not adhere to the expectations of the Rasch partial credit model (χ 2 = 119. 92; p < 0. 05). Multiple items displayed inadequate response categories and two items displayed differential item functioning by gender. Items were transformed and one <b>item</b> <b>deleted</b> leading to an adequate fit. Remaining items fit the Rasch model but still do not target well the population under study. Conclusions The original version of the 30 -item DASH did not display adequate validity evidence for use in a population with Dupuytren’s contracture.

40|$|Background: Fibromyalgia (FM) {{remains a}} {{relatively}} misunderstood and clinically challenging condition that impact {{significantly in the}} individual´s life, impairing global functioning and diminishing quality of life. Management is complex and frequently unsatisfactory, requiring personal tailoring and adaptation of interventions according to the fluctuations of the disease manifestations and their response to therapy. The use of comprehensive and quantified assessment tools constitutes, therefore, {{an essential component of}} the management of patients with FM. The Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR) is currently one of the most used and well validated instruments to assess functional (in) capacity and global impact of FM and associated symptoms. Objectives: To translate to Portuguese the FIQR and to study its psychometric properties. Material and Methods: The total sample comprised 103 women with fibromyalgia, defined according to the established criteria for FM. A self-report battery composed by the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR), the Portuguese version of Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the Profile of Mood States (PoMS) was administered. The FIQR was re-administered to twenty-four participants, six weeks after the first evaluation. Internal reliability was assessed through Cronbach’s alpha, corrected item-total score correlations and alpha if <b>item</b> <b>deleted.</b> Spearman and Pearson correlations along with repeated measures tests were computed to assess the temporal stability of the scale. Convergent and divergent validity were assessed via Spearman and Pearson correlations. Results: The FIQR demonstrated a good to very good internal consistency (from α = 0. 87 to α = 0. 94). All items correlated to a good degree (above 0. 30) to the total score and contributed significantly to the overall reliability. Moreover, FIQR presented a good temporal stability (from r =. 617 to r =. 886, p ≤. 001) and favorable convergent and discriminant validity with depressive symptoms (r >. 289, p ≤. 01) and positive (r > -. 186, p >. 05) and negative affect (r >. 206, p ≤. 05).

40|$|Background. Researchers have {{emphasized}} {{a need to}} identify predictors that can explain the variability in weight management after bariatric surgery. Eating self-efficacy has demonstrated predictive impact on patients’ adherence to recommended eating habits following multidisciplinary treatment programs, but has to a limited extent been subject for research after bariatric surgery. Recently an American short form version (WEL-SF) of the commonly used Weight Efficacy Lifestyle Questionnaire (WEL) was available for research and clinical purposes. Objectives. We intended to translate and culturally adapt the WEL-SF to Norwegian conditions, and to evaluate the new versions’ psychometrical properties in a Norwegian population of morbidly obese patients eligible for bariatric surgery. Design. Cross-sectional Methods. A total of 225 outpatients selected for Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) were recruited; 114 non-operated and 111 operated patients, respectively. The questionnaire was translated through forward and backward procedures. Structural properties were assessed performing principal component analysis (PCA), correlation and regression analysis were conducted to evaluate convergent validity and sensitivity, respectively. Data was assessed by mean, median, item response, missing values, floor- and ceiling effect, Cronbach’s alpha and alpha if <b>item</b> <b>deleted.</b> Results. The PCA resulted in one factor with eigenvalue > 1, explaining 63. 0 % of the variability. The WEL-SF sum scores were positively correlated with the Self-efficacy {{and quality of life}} instruments (p < 0. 001). The WEL-SF was associated with body mass index (BMI) (p < 0. 001) and changes in BMI (p = 0. 026). A very high item response was obtained with only one missing value (0. 4 %). The ceiling effect was in average 0. 9 and 17. 1 % in the non-operated and operated sample, respectively. Strong internal consistency (r = 0. 92) was obtained, and Cronbach’s alpha remained high (0. 86 – 0. 92) if single items were deleted. Conclusion. The Norwegian version of WEL-SF appears to be a valid questionnaire on eating self-efficacy, with acceptable psychometrical properties in a population of morbidly obese patients. </p...|$|E
40|$|AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To {{develop and}} {{to test the}} psychometric {{properties}} of the Chinese Health Literacy Scale for Diabetes. BACKGROUND: Patients with diabetes encounter many challenges when making health decisions in their daily lives, as they have access to many different kinds of health information. Health literacy issues are new topics in Chinese society. Without a valid and reliable instrument in Chinese, it is difficult to measure the level of health literacy and promote the concept of health literacy in Chinese societies. DESIGN: A methodological study with a sample of 137 patients with type 2 diabetes aged 65 years or older. METHOD: Chinese Health Literacy Scale for Diabetes was developed with reference to the revised Bloom's taxonomy model. Psychometric tests (content validity, item analysis, construct validity, discriminative ability and test-retest reliability) were conducted. Correlations between Chinese Health Literacy Scale for Diabetes and four relevant measures were tested. Cronbach's alpha and alpha if <b>item</b> <b>deleted</b> were calculated to assess internal consistency. RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha for Chinese Health Literacy Scale for Diabetes and its four subscales (remembering, understanding, applying and analysing) were 0. 884, 0. 885, 0. 667, 0. 654 and 0. 717, respectively. The Chinese Health Literacy Scale for Diabetes was significantly correlated with the Diabetic Knowledge Scale (r = 0. 398, p < 0. 001), the Diabetic Management Self-Efficacy Scale (r = 0. 257, p < 0. 001), the Preschool and Primary Chinese Literacy Scale (r = 0. 822, p < 0. 001) and the Chinese Value of Learning Scale (r = 0. 303, p < 0. 001). It took an average of seven minutes to complete this 34 -item instrument. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study support the Chinese Health Literacy Scale for Diabetes as a reliable and valid instrument for measuring the health literacy of Chinese patients with diabetes.

OBJECTIVES: To translate, adapt, {{and test}} the measurement properties of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Patella (VISA-P) questionnaire. BACKGROUND: It is important to objectively measure symptoms and functional limitations related to patellar tendinopathy using outcome measures that have been validated {{in the language of}} the target population. Cross-cultural adaptations are also useful to enhance the understanding of the measurement properties of an assessment tool, regardless of the target language. METHODS: the VISA-P questionnaire was translated into Brazilian Portuguese, culturally adapted, and titled VISA-P Brazil. It was then administered on 2 occasions with a 24 - to 48 -hour interval between them, and a third time after a month of physical therapy treatment. the following measurement properties were analyzed: internal consistency, test-retest reliability, agreement, construct validity, floor and ceiling effects, and responsiveness. ESULTS: the VISA-P Brazil had high internal consistency (Cronbach alpha =. 76; if <b>item</b> <b>deleted,</b> Cronbach alpha =. 69 - 18), excellent reliability and agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0. 91; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 85, 0. 95; standard error of measurement, 5. 2 points; minimal detectable change at the 90 % confidence level, 12. 2 points), and good construct validity (Pearson r = 0. 60 compared to Lysholm). No ceiling and floor effects were detected for the VISA-P Brazil, and the responsiveness, based on 32 patients receiving physical therapy intervention for 1 month, demonstrated a large effect size of 0. 97 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 68, 1. 25). CONCLUSION: the VISA-P Brazil is a reproducible and responsive tool and can be used in clinical practice and research to assess the severity of pain and disability of patients with patellar tendinopathy.

The thesis was designed as two part study. Part I the literature study was performed. Through PubMed and ELIN navigator which contains 17 data bases, covering the period from 1996 to 2005, June. Studies were included if they concerned perceptions of conscience exploration among care professionals in hospital setting. Methanalysis was carried out and model of Conscience was performed. The aim of study part 2 was to adapt the Lithuanian version of questionnaire Conscience to Lithuanian conditions and to test its reliability and validity. The adaptation procedure consisted of translation, expert panel checking relevancy of questions and examining psychometric properties of Lithuanian version of questionnaire Conscience. A pilot study was performed at two Lithuanian hospitals. Study subjects n = 99. Reliability was estimated by testing internal consistency. Correlation coefficient Cronbach’s alpha r = 0, 788, split half analysis correlation coefficients: Cronbach’s alpha r = 0, 575, Spearmans – Brown r = 0, 73, Guttman – Split half coefficient r = 0, 73. Validity was performed by testing face validity, content validity and construct validity. Face validity was confirmed by expert panel. Content validity was estimated by Cronbach’s Alpha if <b>item</b> <b>deleted</b> confirmed relevant data. An orthogonal principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation was conducted on the 16 items. Data adequacy KMO criterion on sphericity 0, 695 confirms that data fits to factor analysis. The six factors with factorial weight L ≤ 0, 4 explained 69 % dispersion of the data. Factorial weight L ranged from 0, 443 to 0, 872. The instrument seems to be reliable and valid to assess the conscience among care professionals in hospital setting in Lithuania...|$|E
40|$|This study {{responds}} to the globally increasing rate of caesarean section, and specifically to the very high rate of elective caesarean section among Taiwanese mothers as evidence suggests that such elective caesareans pose potential health risks for mothers and babies. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop and evaluate a multi-component instrument based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to better understand Taiwanese pregnant women 2 ̆ 7 s decisions regarding their childbirth delivery options (spontaneous vaginal delivery or elective caesarean section). The study was a four-phased mixed method design. First, the TPB guided item development and instrument drafting. Second, pretesting and instrument refinement used cognitive interviewing with a small sample of Taiwanese pregnant women. Third, the instrument was administered to 310 such women to examine psychometric properties of the component scales. Fourth, the phase 3 instrument was re-administered to 30 women to estimate item stability. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were used to assess construct validity of the multi-item, multi-component measurement model with LISREL 9. 1. Based on the TPB, the 52 -item self-administered Childbirth Delivery Options Questionnaire (CDOQ) was developed to measure three components: intention regarding delivery options, attitudes toward delivery options, and perceptions of significant others 2 ̆ 7 (partner, mother, and mother-in-law) feelings about delivery options. Respondents from phase two thought that the items on the CDOQ were easy to read and comprehend; they reported favorably on the wording and formatting. Preliminary item analysis revealed that the items referring to dangerousness of delivery options did not function as intended and were dropped because they did not differentiate between the two delivery options, leaving 36 items. Test-retest reliability indicated that responses to each item were positively correlated and those referring to spontaneous vaginal delivery were more stable than those referring to elective caesarean section. Corrected item-to-total correlations and expected change in Cronbach 2 ̆ 7 s alpha if <b>item</b> <b>deleted</b> revealed that four items might form a measure of general social norms associated with the Taiwanese culture. The Cronbach 2 ̆ 7 s alphas for the components of the CDOQ ranged from. 55 to. 89. The measurement model incorporating the design features of the CDOQ fitted the data well using the CFA. Because serious problems with multicollinearity and suppression were revealed, Beckstead 2 ̆ 7 s (2012) criterion-irrelevant-variance-omitted (CIVO) regression method was used to untangle the suppressor effects when predicting intention from the other components of the CDOQ. The results indicated that attitude and partner 2 ̆ 7 s feelings were significant and explained the bulk of the variance in intentions. The TPB-based instrument developed here will be of considerable use to maternal-child health researchers. The findings of this study suggest that decisions regarding delivery options may be modified by interventions geared toward pregnant women 2 ̆ 7 s attitudes within family- and cultural-centered prenatal programs...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop an {{instrument}} for measuring self-concept for children and adoles-cents in a self-evaluation form. Methods: The participants consisted of elementary and middle school students se-lected from five schools in urban areas (n= 2, 407). The scale developmental processes included construction of a conceptual framework, development of preliminary items, verification of content validity and reliability, and con-current validity of final items. Results: There were no <b>items</b> <b>deleting</b> and resulting 80 final items including 4 subscales: Physical self-concept (20 items); Emotional self-concept (20); Social self-concept (20); and Academic self-concept (20). The internal consistency was acceptable (Cronbach's ⍺=. 97). The scale classification provides a description of self-concept degree from very positive to very negative. In this study, self- concept was significantly correlated with depression (- 0. 77 ≤r≤- 0. 51, p<. 001). Conclusion: The results of this study will be useful not only for measuring self-concept of Korean children and adolescents but also for understanding their self-concept development...|$|R

40|$|Omeka 1. 2 was {{released}} on April 8, 2010. Core Changes Adds theme configuration capabilities on a per-theme basis. Theme writers can now add configuration options to their themes, which can be changed by Omeka users from admin. Such configurations include switching CSS-style sheets and adding a logo to the theme's header. Adds two new configurable themes to the pre-packaged group of themes: Seasons and Rhythm. Rhythm offers three style sheets for different color palettes. Seasons offers four style sheets and option for uploading a logo file. Adds security setting to enable/disable checking a file MIME type {{by looking at the}} file header. Updates the omeka-xml output to use version 3 of the schema. Adds a commented-out RewriteBase rule to various. htaccess files in Omeka. Admin Theme Changes Adds button for configuring themes, if they have a configuration form. Add styles to resize img and object elements to prevent overflowing in admin; Updates files/show. php and items/show. php to use the fullsize image when available. Updates the Item Type edit form, to make adding elements to an Item Type more user friendly. Fixes bug where form errors were not displaying correctly. Adds cautionary text in confirm boxes for <b>delete</b> <b>item,</b> <b>delete</b> element set, <b>delete</b> <b>item</b> type, <b>delete</b> collection, delete user, and remove element from item type. API Changes Adds get_theme_option helper to retrieve current theme options set in the admin. Updates image helpers for images so that they use the 'alt' option first, then the description in the file metadata, then the title in the file metadata, and finally, if these are unavailable, the item title. Fixes get_collections() helper to allow returning collections that are both public and featured. Deprecates form helpers in favor of Zend Form methods. The following helpers can still be used, but will be removed in a future release: label() textarea() input() select() Miscellaneous Update Zend to version 1. 9. 7...|$|R
