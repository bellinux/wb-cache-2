5|$|<b>Gastrointestinal</b> and urinary pH affect {{absorption}} and elimination. <b>Gastrointestinal</b> alkalizing (acidifying) agents increase (decrease) absorption. Urinary alkalizing (acidifying) agents increase {{concentration of}} non-ionized (ionized) species, decreasing (increasing) urinary excretion.|$|E
5|$|In adults, {{the initial}} {{treatment}} for paracetamol overdose is <b>gastrointestinal</b> decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the <b>gastrointestinal</b> tract is complete {{within two hours}} under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. Gastric lavage, better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Activated charcoal {{is the most common}} <b>gastrointestinal</b> decontamination procedure as it adsorbs paracetamol, reducing its <b>gastrointestinal</b> absorption. Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of aspiration than gastric lavage.|$|E
5|$|The {{suspensory}} muscle {{marks the}} formal {{division between the}} first and second parts of the small intestine, the duodenum and the jejunum. This division is used to mark the difference between the upper and lower <b>gastrointestinal</b> tracts, which is relevant in clinical medicine as it may determine the source of bleeding in the <b>gastrointestinal</b> tract.|$|E
5|$|Unusual eating {{behavior}} {{occurs in}} {{about three-quarters of}} children with ASD, {{to the extent that}} it was formerly a diagnostic indicator. Selectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals and food refusal also occur; this does not appear to result in malnutrition. Although some children with autism also have <b>gastrointestinal</b> symptoms, there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that children with autism have more or different <b>gastrointestinal</b> symptoms than usual; studies report conflicting results, and the relationship between <b>gastrointestinal</b> problems and ASD is unclear.|$|E
5|$|When {{taken with}} NSAIDS (non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} medications), warfarin {{increases the risk}} for <b>gastrointestinal</b> bleeding. This increased risk {{is due to the}} anti-platelet effect of NSAIDS as well as the possible damage to the <b>gastrointestinal</b> mucosa.|$|E
5|$|Crohn's {{disease is}} a type of {{inflammatory}} bowel disease (IBD) that may affect any part of the <b>gastrointestinal</b> tract from mouth to anus. Signs and symptoms often include abdominal pain, diarrhea (which may be bloody if inflammation is severe), fever, and weight loss. Other complications may occur outside the <b>gastrointestinal</b> tract and include anemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, and tiredness. The skin rashes may be due to infections as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum. Bowel obstruction also commonly occurs and those with the disease are at greater risk of bowel cancer.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gastrointestinal</b> {{disorders}} are sometimes associated with aphthous-like stomatitis, e.g. most commonly Celiac disease, but also {{inflammatory bowel disease}} such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. The link between <b>gastrointestinal</b> disorders and aphthous stomatitis is probably related to nutritional deficiencies caused by malabsorption. Less than 5% of people with RAS have Celiac disease, which usually presents with severe malnutrition, anemia, abdominal pain, diarrhea and glossitis (inflammation of the tongue). Sometimes aphthous-like ulcerations can be {{the only sign of}} celiac disease. Despite this association, a gluten-free diet does not usually improve the oral ulceration.|$|E
5|$|Parsonnet et al. {{describe}} {{an association between}} H. pylori and lymphomas of the <b>gastrointestinal</b> tract. These malignant ulcers can also be treated by eradicating Helicobacter.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} miRNA dysregulation of gene {{expression}} {{seem to be}} important in cancer. For instance, in <b>gastrointestinal</b> cancers, nine miRNAs have been identified as epigenetically altered and effective in down regulating DNA repair enzymes.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} adverse effect of {{metformin}} is <b>gastrointestinal</b> irritation, including diarrhea, cramps, nausea, vomiting, and increased flatulence; metformin is more {{commonly associated with}} <b>gastrointestinal</b> side effects than most other antidiabetic drugs. The most serious potential side effect of metformin use is lactic acidosis; this complication is very rare, {{and the vast majority}} of these cases seem to be related to comorbid conditions, such as impaired liver or kidney function, rather than to the metformin itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of poisoning are typically <b>gastrointestinal</b> and neurological. Symptoms occur within 6–12hours of consumption, although cases of more severe poisoning may present sooner—as little as 2 hours after ingestion. Initial symptoms are <b>gastrointestinal,</b> with sudden onset of nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea {{which may be}} bloodstained. Dehydration may develop if the vomiting or diarrhea is severe. Dizziness, lethargy, vertigo, tremor, ataxia, nystagmus, and headaches develop soon after; fever often occurs, a distinctive feature which does not develop after poisoning by other types of mushrooms. In most cases of poisoning, symptoms do not progress from these initial symptoms, and patients recover after 2–6 days of illness.|$|E
5|$|Two {{parasitic}} worms {{first discovered}} in the <b>gastrointestinal</b> tract of camas pocket gophers are the nematode Heligmosomoides thomomyos and the cestode Hymenolepis tualatinensis. Other worms include two nematodes and the cestode Hymenolepis horrida.|$|E
5|$|Zirconium cyclosilicate {{is under}} {{investigation}} for oral therapy {{in the treatment of}} hyperkalemia. It is a highly selective oral sorbent designed specifically to trap potassium ions in preference to other ions throughout the <b>gastrointestinal</b> tract.|$|E
5|$|A recent {{necropsy}} {{study of}} captive elk in Pennsylvania attributed {{the cause of}} death in 33 of 65 cases to either <b>gastrointestinal</b> parasites (21 cases, primarily Eimeria sp. and Ostertagia sp.) or bacterial infections (12 cases, mostly pneumonia).|$|E
5|$|A {{supported}} {{lipid bilayer}} (SLB) {{as described above}} has achieved commercial success as a screening technique to measure the permeability of drugs. This parallel artificial membrane permeability assay PAMPA technique measures the permeability across specifically formulated lipid cocktail(s) found to be highly correlated with Caco-2 cultures, the <b>gastrointestinal</b> tract, blood–brain barrier and skin.|$|E
5|$|Although the lilac-brown bolete {{was once}} {{considered}} edible, caution is typically recommended in modern field guides when considering this bolete {{for the table}} after several poisonings were reported in northeastern North America. Symptoms include severe <b>gastrointestinal</b> distress with vomiting, diarrhea, and nausea that generally lasts less than 24 hours.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{symptoms}} of immune deficiency characteristic of AIDS do not appear for years after a person is infected, the bulk of CD4+ T cell loss occurs during the first weeks of infection, especially in the intestinal mucosa, which harbors {{the majority of the}} lymphocytes found in the body. T cells from effector sites in the <b>gastrointestinal</b> tract |journal=J. Exp. Med. |volume=200 |issue=6 |pages=761–70 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15365095 |doi=10.1084/jem.20041196 |url= |pmc=2211967}} The reason for the preferential loss of mucosal CD4+ T cells is that the majority of mucosal CD4+ T cells express the CCR5 protein which HIV uses as a co-receptor {{to gain access to the}} cells, whereas only a small fraction of CD4+ T cells in the bloodstream do so. T cell depletion during all stages of HIV disease occurs predominantly in the <b>gastrointestinal</b> tract |journal=J. Exp. Med. |volume=200 |issue=6 |pages=749–59 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15365096 |doi=10.1084/jem.20040874 |url= |pmc=2211962}} A specific genetic change that alters the CCR5 protein when present in both chromosomes very effectively prevents HIV-1 infection.|$|E
5|$|Amphetamine {{stimulates the}} {{medullary}} respiratory centers, producing faster and deeper breaths. In {{a normal person}} at therapeutic doses, this effect is usually not noticeable, but when respiration is already compromised, it may be evident. Amphetamine also induces contraction in the urinary bladder sphincter, the muscle which controls urination, which can result in difficulty urinating. This effect {{can be useful in}} treating bed wetting and loss of bladder control. The effects of amphetamine on the <b>gastrointestinal</b> tract are unpredictable. If intestinal activity is high, amphetamine may reduce <b>gastrointestinal</b> motility (the rate at which content moves through the digestive system); however, amphetamine may increase motility when the smooth muscle of the tract is relaxed. Amphetamine also has a slight analgesic effect and can enhance the pain relieving effects of opioids.|$|E
5|$|Colchicine is an {{alternative}} for those unable to tolerate NSAIDs. At high doses, side effects (primarily <b>gastrointestinal</b> upset) limit its usage. At lower doses, which are still effective, it is well tolerated. Colchicine may interact with other commonly prescribed drugs, such as atorvastatin and erythromycin, among others.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis is {{strongly}} attenuated by ingestion of zinc, possibly by direct antimicrobial {{action of the}} ions in the <b>gastrointestinal</b> tract, or by the absorption of the zinc and re-release from immune cells (all granulocytes secrete zinc), or both.|$|E
5|$|Histologically, cholangiocarcinomas are classically well to {{moderately}} differentiated adenocarcinomas. Immunohistochemistry {{is useful}} in the diagnosis and {{may be used to}} help differentiate a cholangiocarcinoma from hepatocellular carcinoma and metastasis of other <b>gastrointestinal</b> tumors. Cytological scrapings are often nondiagnostic, as these tumors typically have a desmoplastic stroma and, therefore, do not release diagnostic tumor cells with scrapings.|$|E
5|$|In acute poisoning, typical {{neurological}} {{signs are}} pain, muscle weakness, numbness and tingling, and, rarely, symptoms associated with {{inflammation of the}} brain. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation are other acute symptoms. Lead's effects on the mouth include astringency and a metallic taste. <b>Gastrointestinal</b> problems, such as constipation, diarrhea, poor appetite, or weight loss, are common in acute poisoning. Absorption of large amounts of lead over a short time can cause shock (insufficient fluid in the circulatory system) due to loss {{of water from the}} <b>gastrointestinal</b> tract. Hemolysis (the rupture of red blood cells) due to acute poisoning can cause anemia and hemoglobin in the urine. Damage to kidneys can cause changes in urination such as decreased urine output. People who survive acute poisoning often go on to display symptoms of chronic poisoning.|$|E
5|$|In adults, the {{diagnosis}} {{is supported by the}} absence of classical or structural diseases of the <b>gastrointestinal</b> system. Supportive criteria include a regurgitant that does not taste sour or acidic, is generally odourless, is effortless, or at most preceded by a belching sensation, that there is no retching preceding the regurgitation, and that the act is not associated with nausea or heartburn.|$|E
5|$|In general, blue-staining red-pored boletes {{should be}} avoided for consumption. Thiers warned this species may be toxic after being alerted to severe <b>gastrointestinal</b> {{symptoms}} in one who had merely tasted it. Years later, in 1994, a couple developed <b>gastrointestinal</b> symptoms after eating this fungus and the husband died as a result. A subsequent autopsy revealed {{that the man had}} suffered an infarction of the midgut. Rubroboletus pulcherrimus was the only bolete that had been implicated in the death of someone consuming it, It is known to contain low levels of muscarine, a peripheral nervous system toxin. until 2005. A report from Australia records a fatality from muscarinic syndrome after consuming a mushroom from the genus Rubinoboletus.|$|E
5|$|Inducing {{vomiting}} with syrup of ipecac has {{no role in}} paracetamol overdose {{because the}} vomiting it induces delays the effective administration of activated charcoal and oral acetylcysteine. Liver injury is extremely rare after acute accidental ingestion in children under 6 years of age. Children with accidental exposures do not require <b>gastrointestinal</b> decontamination with either gastric lavage, activated charcoal, or syrup of ipecac.|$|E
5|$|Metformin SR (slow release) or XR (extended release) was {{introduced}} in 2004. It is available in 500, 750, and 1000-mg strengths, mainly to counteract common <b>gastrointestinal</b> side effects, {{as well as to}} increase compliance by reducing pill burden. No difference in effectiveness exists between the two preparations.|$|E
5|$|More than 50% of the world's {{population}} harbor H. pylori {{in their}} upper <b>gastrointestinal</b> tract. Infection {{is more common}} in developing countries than Western countries. H. pylori's helical shape (from which the genus name derives) is thought to have evolved to penetrate the mucoid lining of the stomach.|$|E
5|$|Non-reproductive health {{remains an}} {{important}} predictor of maternal health. In the United States, the {{leading causes of}} maternal death are cardiovascular disease (15% of deaths), endocrine, respiratory and <b>gastrointestinal</b> disorders, infection, hemorrhage and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (Gronowski and Schindler, Table II).|$|E
5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} {{presents itself}} {{in a variety of}} ways, with especially high contrast existing between the presentation of the typical adult sufferer without a mental disability and the presentation of an infant and/or mentally impaired sufferer. Like related <b>gastrointestinal</b> disorders, rumination can adversely affect normal functioning and the social lives of individuals. It has been linked with depression.|$|E
5|$|The {{surrounded}} sac {{becomes the}} primitive gut. Sections of this gut begin to differentiate into the organs of the <b>gastrointestinal</b> tract, {{such as the}} esophagus, stomach, and intestines. The esophagus develops {{as part of the}} foregut tube. The innervation of the esophagus develops from the pharyngeal arches.|$|E
5|$|Vanadium {{compounds}} {{are poorly}} absorbed through the <b>gastrointestinal</b> system. Inhalation of vanadium and vanadium compounds results primarily in {{adverse effects on}} the respiratory system. Quantitative data are, however, insufficient to derive a subchronic or chronic inhalation reference dose. Other effects have been reported after oral or inhalation exposures on blood parameters, liver, neurological development, and other organs in rats.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gastrointestinal</b> {{bleeding}} can {{be roughly}} {{divided into two}} clinical syndromes: upper <b>gastrointestinal</b> bleeding and lower <b>gastrointestinal</b> bleeding. About 2/3 of all GI bleeds are from upper sources and 1/3 from lower sources. Common causes of <b>gastrointestinal</b> bleeding include infections, cancers, vascular disorders, adverse effects of medications, and blood clotting disorders. Obscure <b>gastrointestinal</b> bleeding (OGIB) is when a source is unclear following investigation.|$|E
25|$|Upper <b>gastrointestinal</b> {{bleeding}} is <b>gastrointestinal</b> {{bleeding in}} the upper <b>gastrointestinal</b> tract, commonly defined as bleeding arising from the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum. Blood may be observed in vomit (hematemesis) or in altered form in the stool (melena). Depending on {{the severity of the}} blood loss, there may be symptoms of insufficient circulating blood volume and shock. As a result, upper <b>gastrointestinal</b> bleeding is considered a medical emergency and typically requires hospital care for urgent diagnosis and treatment. Upper <b>gastrointestinal</b> bleeding can be caused by peptic ulcers, gastric erosions, esophageal varices, and some rarer causes such as gastric cancer.|$|E
25|$|Various {{types of}} barium X-ray {{examinations}} {{are used to}} examine {{different parts of the}} <b>gastrointestinal</b> tract. These include barium swallow, barium meal, barium follow-through, and barium enema. The barium swallow, barium meal, and barium follow-through are together also called an upper <b>gastrointestinal</b> series (or study), whereas the barium enema is called a lower <b>gastrointestinal</b> series (or study). In upper <b>gastrointestinal</b> series examinations, the barium sulfate is mixed with water and swallowed orally, whereas in the lower <b>gastrointestinal</b> series (barium enema), the barium contrast agent is administered as an enema through a small tube inserted into the rectum.|$|E
25|$|Pathologically, {{the mouth}} {{represents}} a transition between the <b>gastrointestinal</b> tract and the skin, meaning that many <b>gastrointestinal</b> and cutaneous conditions can involve the mouth. Some conditions {{usually associated with}} the whole <b>gastrointestinal</b> tract may present only in the mouth, e.g., orofacial granulomatosis/oral Crohn's disease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gastrointestinal</b> cancer {{may occur}} {{at any point}} in the <b>gastrointestinal</b> tract, and {{includes}} mouth cancer, tongue cancer, oesophageal cancer, stomach cancer, and colorectal cancer.|$|E
