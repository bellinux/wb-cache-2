25|$|The rule {{of strict}} {{liability}} famously {{laid down by}} Blackburn J., in Rylands v. Fletcher, proved to be rather ineffective {{with the passage of}} time to counter the dangerous use of one’s property or an industry that produced substances or wastes detrimental to public health. The pre-requirements essential for establishing a liability under the principle of strict liability viz., the non-natural use of land, use of a <b>dangerous</b> <b>thing,</b> and the element of escape provided substantial loopholes to the enterprises to escape liability under the Rylands v. Fletcher rule. Moreover, the exceptions provided within the rule (and restated by the Supreme Court of India in MC Mehta v. Union of India) afford ample opportunity to the commercial enterprises to escape liability.|$|E
25|$|When {{the prince}} became Amir in 1919 and {{subsequently}} King in 1926, the queen {{had an important}} role in the evolution of the Country and was always close to her husband. He had her take part in all national events. He was said, ”I am your king, but the Minister of Education is my wife—your Queen”. Queen Soraya was the first Muslim consort who appeared in public together with her husband, something which was unheard of at the time. She participated with him in the hunting parties, riding on horseback, and in some Cabinet meetings. She was present at military parades with the king. During the war of Independence, she visited the tents of wounded soldiers, talked to them, offered them presents and comfort. She accompanied the king even in some rebellious provinces of the country, something which was a very <b>dangerous</b> <b>thing</b> to do at that time.|$|E

The problem for the aircrew was {{that they would be}} dropping a live hydrogen bomb—generally considered a <b>dangerous</b> <b>thing</b> to do—with no means of verifying that their instruments were correct. Air Chief Marshal Sir Harry Broadhurst, the head of Bomber Command, wished O'Connor luck; his XD827 would make the drop, with Squadron Leader Tony Caillard in XD827, the grandstand aircraft. The aircraft took off at 07:15 on 11 September 1958. Once in the air, though, a fault developed in the ground radar transmitter. Grandy then authorised a visual drop. It was later confirmed that it was [...] from the target. [...] It was detonated at [...] at 08:49 with a yield of about , very close to the predicted yield of [...]|$|E
500|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 2010 Hungarian Grand Prix, Rubens Barrichello {{attempted}} to pass Schumacher down the inside on the main straight. Schumacher closed the inside line to force Barrichello onto the outside, but Barrichello persisted on the inside at , despite the close proximity of a concrete wall and Schumacher leaving him only inches to spare. Barrichello said [...] "It is the most <b>dangerous</b> <b>thing</b> that I have been through", and [...] "There is not a rule for that, but between ourselves we should take a line, stick to it and that's it." [...] Schumacher said that [...] "Obviously there was space enough to go through. We didn't touch, so I guess I just left enough space for him to come through." [...] Ross Brawn said [...] "at {{the end of the}} day he gave him enough space. You can argue that it was marginal, but it was just tough – tough racing." [...] A range of ex-drivers and commentators were highly critical of Schumacher. Although there was no accident, the race steward, the same Derek Warwick of the 1991 Nürburgring incident, wanted to black flag Schumacher since that [...] "would have shown a better example to our young drivers". The Hungaroring incident was ruled to be dangerous and Schumacher received a 10 place grid penalty for the next race. Schumacher accepted the decision, and apologised.|$|E

2500|$|The next {{element of}} Rylands {{is that the}} thing be {{something}} [...] "likely to do mischief if it escapes". Before Transco plc v Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council this {{did not have to}} be a dangerous item (see below); the risk was instead in its behaviour if it escapes. In Rylands the [...] "thing" [...] was water. Other examples are fire, as in Jones v Festiniog Railway, gas, as in Batchellor v Tunbridge Wells Gas Co, fumes, as in West v Bristol Tramways Co, and electricity, as in Hillier v Air Ministry. The extent of the [...] "thing"'s accumulation can also be considered, as in Mason v Levy, where it was not just the type of thing kept but the sheer amount which created the danger. It is essential for a Rylands claim that there be an escape of a <b>dangerous</b> <b>thing</b> [...] "from a place where the defendant has occupation of or control over land to a place which is outside his occupation or control". In Read v J Lyons & Co Ltd, an explosion in a munitions factory killed an inspector on the property. Rylands was held not to apply, because there was no escape. The <b>dangerous</b> <b>thing</b> that escapes does not always have to be the thing which was accumulated, but there must be a causal link. In Miles v Forest Rock Granite Co (Leicestershire) Ltd, explosives stored on the defendant's land led to the escape of rocks in a blast, and the defendant was found liable.|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{locations}} where this {{could take place}} was Quintinshill, where there were passing loops for both lines. [...] If the Down (northbound) loop was occupied, as {{it was on the}} morning of the accident, then the northbound local train would be shunted over a trailing crossover onto the Up (southbound) main line. Although not a preferred method of operation, this was allowed by the rules and was not a <b>dangerous</b> <b>thing</b> to do provided the proper precautions were taken. In the six months before the accident the 6.17am local train had been shunted at Quintinshill 21 times, and on four of these occasions it had been shunted onto the Up line.|$|E

2500|$|The Mikado is {{a comedy}} {{that deals with}} themes of death and cruelty. This works only because Gilbert treats these themes as trivial, even lighthearted issues. For instance, in Pish-Tush's song [...] "Our great Mikado, virtuous man", he sings: [...] "The youth who winked a roving eye / Or breathed a non-connubial sigh / Was thereupon {{condemned}} to die– / He usually objected." [...] The term for this rhetorical technique is meiosis, a drastic understatement of the situation. [...] Other examples of this are when self-decapitation is described as [...] "an extremely difficult, not to say <b>dangerous,</b> <b>thing</b> to attempt", and also as merely [...] "awkward". When a discussion occurs of Nanki-Poo's life being [...] "cut short in a month", the tone remains comic and only mock-melancholy. Burial alive is described as [...] "a stuffy death". Finally, execution by boiling oil or by melted lead is described by the Mikado as a [...] "humorous but lingering" [...] punishment.|$|E
2500|$|The team, led by Ella, defies Shade's {{orders and}} infiltrates the Meat Factory, {{successfully}} rescuing Drum. They then leave cautiously, using the Deceptors to mask their trail. While resting among {{the branches of}} a large tree, Ninde telepathically detects an Overlord. The detection proves not only to be hard mentally on her since the Overlord is of human or greater intelligence, but also emotionally hard: Ninde discovers that the Overlords are essentially human. Despite the difficulty, she discovers that the Overlord may know something about [...] "a mind in a machine" [...] -a <b>dangerous</b> <b>thing</b> for them, since Shade - a machine intelligence- is their leader and benefactor. They continue, to discover on reaching the Submarine that it has been invaded by an Overlord, Red Diamond, and that all of the people inside have been killed or captured. Fortunately, Shade had realized long before that the Sub was not a permanent base, and established multiple supply caches throughout the city in case a team was stranded in the field or the Sub was taken. True to their training, the team heads immediately to the nearest cache - to discover Shade, who escaped, apparently by chance, while testing a mobile robotic body for himself based around the Thinker. Shade's escape is doubly fortuitous in that the Overlord used an electromagnetic pulse weapon to disable the Submarine; had he been within range of the weapon, he would have been incapacitated.|$|E
2500|$|Foscarini sent {{a copy of}} {{his book}} to Bellarmine, who replied in a letter of April 12, 1615. Galileo is {{mentioned}} by name in the letter, and a copy was soon sent to him. [...] After some preliminary salutations and acknowledgements, Bellarmine begins by telling Foscarini that it is prudent for him and Galileo to limit themselves to treating heliocentrism as a merely hypothetical phenomenon and not a physically real one. [...] Further on he says that interpreting heliocentrism as physically real would be [...] "a very <b>dangerous</b> <b>thing,</b> likely not only to irritate all scholastic philosophers and theologians, but also to harm the Holy Faith by rendering Holy Scripture as false." [...] Moreover, while the topic was not inherently a matter of faith, the statements about it in Scripture were so by virtue of who said them—namely, the Holy Spirit. [...] He conceded that if there were conclusive proof, [...] "then one would have to proceed with great care in explaining the Scriptures that appear contrary; and say rather that we do not understand them, than that what is demonstrated is false." [...] However, demonstrating that heliocentrism merely [...] "saved the appearances" [...] could not be regarded as sufficient to establish that it was physically real. [...] Although he believed that the former may well have been possible, he had [...] "very great doubts" [...] that the latter would be, and in case of doubt it was not permissible to depart from the traditional interpretation of Scriptures. His final argument was a rebuttal of an analogy that Foscarini had made between a moving Earth and a ship on which the passengers perceive themselves as apparently stationary and the receding shore as apparently moving. [...] Bellarmine replied {{that in the case of}} the ship the passengers know that their perceptions are erroneous and can mentally correct them, whereas the scientist on the Earth clearly experiences that it is stationary and therefore the perception that the Sun, moon and stars are moving is not in error and does not need to be corrected.|$|E
