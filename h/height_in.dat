5|$|The Scandinavian {{influence}} in Scotland was probably at its <b>height</b> <b>in</b> the mid eleventh century {{during the time}} of Thorfinn Sigurdsson, who attempted to create a single political and ecclesiastical domain stretching from Shetland to Man.

5|$|Under Basil II, the Byzantines {{established}} {{a swath of}} new themata, stretching northeast from Aleppo (a Byzantine protectorate) to Manzikert. Under the Theme system of military and administrative government, the Byzantines could raise a force at least 200,000 strong, though in practice these were strategically placed throughout the Empire. With Basil's rule, the Byzantine Empire reached its greatest <b>height</b> <b>in</b> nearly five centuries, and indeed {{for the next four}} centuries.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} of scattered Brythonic settlements in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the Romans after the invasion of 43AD. This lasted only until around 61, when the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it, burning it to the ground. The next, heavily planned, incarnation of Londinium prospered, and it superseded Colchester as the capital of the Roman province of Britannia in 100. At its <b>height</b> <b>in</b> the 2nd century, Roman London had a population of around 60,000.|$|E
5|$|As a Postelsia alga grows, its stipe thickens in {{the same}} manner as a tree's trunk. The cells beneath the epidermis, called the meristoderm, divide rapidly to form rings of growth, again, like a tree. However, the greater {{flexibility}} of Postelsia stipe over that of a woody tree makes for some distinct differences. Postelsia must be thicker than a tree of equal <b>height</b> <b>in</b> order to support itself. However, the stipe is very much more suited to the coastal habitat, as it allows the seaweed to bend with the constant wave action. Such an environment would cause the inflexible, woody tree to break.|$|E

The appearance of homosexual characters was at its <b>height</b> <b>in</b> 1933; in that year, Hays declared that all gay male characters would be removed from pictures.

5|$|Live & Kicking is a BBC Saturday morning children's {{magazine}} programme, {{running from}} 1993 to 2001. The fourth in {{a succession of}} Saturday morning shows, it was the replacement for Going Live!, and took many of its features from it, such as phone-ins, games, comedy, competitions and the showing of cartoons. Once Live & Kicking had become established in series two, it reached its <b>height</b> <b>in</b> popularity during series four, when it was presented by Zoë Ball and Jamie Theakston; their final episode won a BAFTA award. After this the series ratings dropped with the launch of SMTV Live on ITV and the show eventually {{came to an end}} in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Prior to developing, the {{precursor}} tropical disturbance dropped heavy rainfall and produced gusty winds, primarily from Zihuatanejo {{in the state}} of Guerrero to Manzanillo {{in the state of}} Colima. The slow motion of Ignacio produced heavy rainfall across the southern portion of the Baja California Peninsula, including a peak 24‑hour total of 7.25inches (184mm) in Ciudad Constitución. The National Hurricane Center warned of rainfall totals of up to 20inches (500mm) in some localized areas, which did verify in Los Cabos. Ignacio produced strong waves which hit the eastern Baja California coastline. Swells of 10feet (3m) in <b>height</b> <b>in</b> La Paz closed the city's small port.|$|E

5|$|The {{allometric}} exponent for sail {{height is}} similar in magnitude to the scaling of interspecific antler length to shoulder <b>height</b> <b>in</b> cervids. Furthermore, as Bakker (1970) observed {{in the context of}} Dimetrodon, many lizard species raise a dorsal ridge of skin during threat and courtship displays, and positively allometric, sexually dimorphic frills and dewlaps are present in extant lizards (Echelle et al. 1978; Christian et al. 1995). There is also evidence of sexual dimorphism both in the robustness of the skeleton and in the relative height of the spines of D. limbatus (Romer and Price 1940).|$|E

It is probable that in the Early Neolithic, the mound had a quarry ditch surrounding it, and it is inside this ditch that the kerb-stones now sit.|$|E

5|$|The war also {{reflected}} a new <b>height</b> <b>in</b> military spending, especially by the Habsburgs. After the Seven Years' War, {{the size of}} the Habsburg military shrank, from 201,311men in arms in 1761 to 163,613in 1775. In preparing for a second summer's campaign, Joseph's army grew from 195,108effectives in the summer of 1778 to 308,555men in arms in Spring 1779. Habsburg military strength never dropped below two hundred thousand effectives between 1779 and 1792, when Austria entered the War of the First Coalition. Several times it surged above three hundred thousand men in arms, responding to needs on the Ottoman border or the revolt in the Austrian Netherlands. The military also underwent a massive organizational overhaul.|$|E
5|$|Winnipeg {{has four}} major rivers: the Red, Assiniboine, La Salle and Seine. The city {{was subject to}} severe {{flooding}} in the past. The Red River reached its greatest flood <b>height</b> <b>in</b> 1826. Another large flood occurred in 1950, which caused {{millions of dollars in}} damage and mass evacuations. This flood prompted Duff Roblin's provincial government to build the Red River Floodway to protect the city; the project began in 1962 and was completed in 1968. In the 1997 flood, flood control dikes were reinforced and raised using sandbags; Winnipeg suffered very limited damage compared to the flood's impact on cities without such structures, such as Grand Forks, North Dakota. The generally flat terrain and the poor drainage of the Red River Valley's clay-based soil also results in many mosquitoes during wetter years.|$|E
5|$|A cold-core low, {{also known}} as an upper level low or cold-core cyclone, is a cyclone aloft which has an {{associated}} cold pool of air residing at high altitude within the Earth's troposphere. It is a low pressure system that strengthens with <b>height</b> <b>in</b> accordance with the thermal wind relationship. If a weak surface circulation forms in response to such a feature at subtropical latitudes of the eastern north Pacific or north Indian oceans, it is called a subtropical cyclone. Cloud cover and rainfall mainly occurs with these systems during the day. Severe weather, such as tornadoes, can occur {{near the center of}} cold-core lows. Cold lows can help spawn cyclones with significant weather impacts, such as polar lows, and Von Karman Vortices. Cold lows can lead directly to the development of tropical cyclones, owing to their associated cold pool of air aloft or by acting as additional outflow channels to aid in further development.|$|E
