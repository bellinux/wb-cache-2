These uniforms {{featured}} crimson jerseys with grey and white <b>houndstooth</b> numbers, a <b>houndstooth</b> stripe on the helmet, <b>houndstooth</b> gloves and an American flag sewn {{into one of the}} sleeves in honor of Veterans Day. The <b>houndstooth</b> design was chosen as a tribute to former Alabama coach Bear Bryant who was known for wearing a <b>houndstooth</b> fedora during games. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Bulldogs to 73–18–3 (75–17–3 without NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E

25|$|Following on {{from the}} mod revival of the late 70s, the UK {{witnessed}} a revival of rude boy and skinhead fashion due to the popularity of ska punk, Oi! punk rock, rocksteady, and two tone music {{during the winter of}} discontent. In the early 80s, slim fitting mohair, tonic and <b>houndstooth</b> suits were popular, together with basket weave shoes, polo shirts, sta-prest trousers, Doc Martens, braces, Harrington jackets and pork pie hats popularized by bands like the Specials, UB40, the Bosstones, and Madness. In response to the racism of white power skinheads, 1980s rude boys wore checkerboard motifs to signify that both black and white people were welcome. Crew cuts and buzzcuts were worn by both sexes, and girls often incorporated hair bangs in a partially shaven style known as a Chelsea mohawk. In Brighton, the Skins of the 1980s fought the outlaw bikers and rockabilly guys, as the Mods and Rockers had previously done in the 60s.|$|E

500|$|The song's music video, {{directed}} by Dave Meyers, follows {{the theme of}} the lyrics. It shows the band on a tour bus, stopping at a party at Club Poonani. The members separate when three girls approach the male band members. Kanal has his picture taken with several women, paying for it by taking money that drummer Adrian Young earns by hanging from gymnastics rings naked. Dumont defeats a woman, portrayed by Sonya Eddy, in an endurance drinking game, and Stefani dances, eventually joining Bounty Killer on stage. There are intercut scenes of the band members on a red and black background, a black and white <b>houndstooth</b> background, and standing on top of the phrases [...] "NO DOUBT", [...] "ROCK STEADY", and [...] "HEY BABY" [...] in red and white.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller and Weirdcore; Muller has worked with Stefani in numerous videos from her band No Doubt and her solo career. On October 20, 2014, Stefani posted on her Instagram a sneak peek of the behind the scenes from the video. It was released on October 21, 2014, {{the day after the}} song's release. According to Daniel Kreps from Rolling Stone, the video, which is [...] "a play on The Wizard of Oz, stars a wildly polygonal yellow brick road, an army of dancers and mountains of reoccurring Stefani patterns like bold black-and-white stripes, <b>houndstooth</b> and plenty of pink." [...] Kreps continued the description, commenting that, [...] "in the eye-popping video, Stefani and her dancers are shown with bright pink Beats by Dre headphones around her neck while using the Beats Music app." [...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard added that the video has Gwen [...] "tiptoeing down a morphing yellow road and showing off the first in her array of polka-dotted outfits," [...] with [...] "a dance troupe eventually arriv to jazz up the clip a little." [...] The beginning of the music video finds the singer in a gray world, {{but by the end of}} the video, the same scenes are now shown in full color.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variety of}} {{finishes}} {{can be applied}} to dimension stone to achieve diverse architectural and aesthetic effects. [...] These finishes include, but are not limited to, the following. [...] A polished finish gives the surface a high luster and strong reflection of incident light (almost mirror-like). [...] A honed finish provides a smooth, satin-like ("eggshell"), nonreflective surface. [...] More textured finishes include brush-hammered, sandblasted, and thermal. [...] A brush-hammered finish, similar to a <b>houndstooth</b> pattern, creates a rough, but uniformly patterned surface with impact tools varying in coarseness. [...] A sandblasted surface provides an irregular pitted surface by impacting sand or metal particles at high velocity against a stone surface. [...] A thermal (or flamed) finish produces a textured, nonreflective surface with only a few reflections from cleavage faces, by applying a high-temperature flame. [...] This finish may change the natural color of the stone depending on mineralogical composition, particularly with stones containing higher levels of iron.|$|E
2500|$|Snow Patrol {{played a}} few side-shows for various radio {{stations}} on the North American {{leg of the}} tour.

50|$|The oldest known {{occurrence}} of <b>houndstooth</b> is the Gerum Cloak, a garment uncovered in a Swedish peat bog, dated to between 360 and 100 BC. Contemporary <b>houndstooth</b> checks may have originated in woven wool cloth of the Scottish Lowlands, but are now {{used in many}} other materials. The traditional <b>houndstooth</b> check is made with alternating bands of four dark and four light threads in both warp and weft/filling woven in a simple 2:2 twill, two over/two under the warp, advancing one thread each pass. In an early reference to <b>houndstooth,</b> De Pinna, a New York City-based men's and women's high-end clothier founded in 1885, included <b>houndstooth</b> checks along with gun club checks and Scotch plaids {{as part of its}} 1933 spring men's suits collection. Oversized <b>houndstooth</b> patterns were also employed prominently at Alexander McQueen's Fall 2009 Collection, entitled Horn of Plenty. The patterns were a reference to Christian Dior's signature tweed suits.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Houndstooth</b> {{designs of}} black and white, brown and tan, and other earthtone weaves, are very popular designs in tweed {{materials}} used for sport coats and other casual clothing. <b>Houndstooth</b> is a common design in casual hats and caps, perhaps most notable in the deerstalker, the kind of cap seen so often in illustrations and portrayals of Sherlock Holmes. U.S. college football coaching legend Paul [...] "Bear" [...] Bryant was frequently seen wearing a <b>houndstooth</b> or checkered patterned hat and <b>houndstooth</b> is frequently seen worn around the University of Alabama, where he coached, {{as a symbol of}} school pride.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1830s, <b>houndstooth</b> {{was known}} in France to be made into an {{emollient}} and diuretic for daily use in inflammatory diseases, especially of the urinary organs. To prepare as a diuretic, the <b>houndstooth</b> leaves were mashed, and then boiled in water to extract oils, volatile organic compounds, and other chemical substances. The mix could be sweetened with liquorice to create Ptisan of Dog's-grass. After decoction, the herbal tea was taken internally a cupful at a time. [...] In 1834, the Hospital of Paris provided a formula of 2/3 ss—J to Oij of water for <b>houndstooth</b> tea. By {{the end of the}} 1830s, doctors in England were using <b>houndstooth</b> as an antiaphrodisiac to combat venereal excesses.|$|E
