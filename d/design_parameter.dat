25|$|Attached to the {{cylindrical}} ballistic {{case was}} a natural-uranium liner, the radiation case. The SHRIMP design used an approximately 2.5cm thick uranium radiation case. Its internal surface was lined with ~240 μm thick copper liner made from 0.08 μm thick copper foil, due to copper possessing excellent reflecting properties, increasing the overall albedo of the hohlraum. Hohlraum albedo {{is a very important}} <b>design</b> <b>parameter</b> for any inertial-confinement configuration. A relatively high albedo permits higher interstage coupling due to the more favorable azimuthal and latitudinal angles of reflected radiation. The limiting value of the albedo for high-Z materials is reached when the thickness is 5–10 g/cm, or 0.5–1.0 free paths. Thus, a hohlraum made of uranium much thicker than a free path of uranium would be disadvantageous in terms of bomb weight and use of raw materials. At the same time the angular anisotropy increases as the atomic number of the scatterer material is reduced. Thus the use of copper, or in other devices of gold or aluminium, as hohlraum liners is imperative as the greater the value of Z of the scatterer the greater this absorption probability will be. There are 2 sources of X-rays in the hohlraum; primary's irradiance which is dominant at the beginning and during the pulse rise and the wall which is important during the required radiation temperature's (T) plateau. The primary emits radiation {{in a manner similar to}} a flash bulb, and the secondary needs constant T to properly implode. This constant wall temperature is dictated by the ablation pressure requirements to drive compression which lay on average at about 0.4 keV (out of a range of 0.2 to 2 keV) corresponding to several thousand kelvins. Wall temperature depended on the temperature of the primary's core which peaked at about 5.4 keV during boosted-fission. The final wall-temperature, which corresponds to energy of the wall-reradiated X-rays to the secondary's pusher, also drops due to losses from the hohlraum material itself. Natural uranium nails, lined to the top of their head with copper, attached the radiation case to the ballistic case. The nails were bolted in vertical arrays in a double-shear configuration to better distribute the shear loads. This method of attaching the radiation case to the ballistic case was first used successfully in the Ivy Mike device. The radiation case had a parabolic end, which housed the COBRA primary that was employed to create the conditions needed to start the fusion reaction, and its other end was a cylinder, as also seen in Bravo's declassified film.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate that optimal greenhouse design must account for (and be combined to) optimal climate management. We prove this by showing that different strategies and set-points to control the greenhouse ventilators result in different ¿optimal sets¿ of <b>design</b> <b>parameters.</b> We determined these optimal sets for a passive greenhouse in Almería, Spain where tomatoes were grown. The greenhouse <b>design</b> <b>parameters</b> investigated in this research were: 1) the transmission of the cover for photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), 2) the transmission of near infrared (NIR) radiation and 3) the emission coefficient for longwave radiation of the cover. Six optimal sets of <b>design</b> <b>parameters</b> were determined by maximising the marginal revenues (crop yield minus costs of <b>design</b> <b>parameters),</b> under given climate conditions, and for different ventilation control strategies. Each ventilation control strategy had different set-points for the air temperature and carbon dioxide concen¬tration to control the greenhouse ventilators. To solve this optimization problem we used a dynamic crop-greenhouse model and an optimization algorithm. The model described the combined influence of the relevant <b>design</b> <b>parameters,</b> outdoor climate and ventilation control upon economic crop yield, through their effect on indoor climate. The yearly costs of the <b>design</b> <b>parameters</b> were empirically derived from prices, physical properties and lifespan of a number of greenhouse cover materials. Results showed that indeed for different strategies and set-points to control the green¬house ventilators different ¿optimal sets¿ of <b>design</b> <b>parameters</b> and marginal revenues were obtained. For example, the difference between the highest optimal NIR trans¬mission 1. 00 and the lowest optimal NIR transmission 0. 40 was 60 %, while the highest marginal revenues 16. 94 ¿m- 2 differed 18, 7 % with the lowest marginal revenues of 13. 77 ¿ m- 2. Additionally, it was found that the cover <b>design</b> <b>parameters</b> were time dependent. In conclusion, only a combined optimal control and design approach that takes into account the best climate control strategy and the time dependency of the <b>design</b> <b>parameters</b> will ensure optimal <b>design</b> <b>parameters</b> and maximum marginal revenues...|$|R

40|$|It {{is evident}} from {{experiences}} in Kenya that rainwater could be the long awaited answer to water scarcity in the next millennium. However, some technical and policy hindrances need to be addressed. Lack of appropriate technical designs, among other factors, has led to low adoption of rainwater harvesting technology, especially in Arid and Semiarid Lands (ASAL), where rainwater {{is one of the}} most viable water supply. This calls for optimisation of Rain Water Catchment Systems (RWCS) <b>design</b> <b>parameters</b> and formulation of comprehensive water policy.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} verification and optimization {{of complex}} sys-tems {{with respect to}} a set of specifications under stochastic parameter variations. We introduce a simulation-based statistically sound model inference approach that considers systems whose responses depend on a few <b>design</b> <b>parameters</b> and many stochastic parameters. The technique iteratively searches over the space of <b>design</b> <b>parameters</b> by alternating between verification and optimization phases. The verification phase uses statistical model checking to check if the model us-ing the current <b>design</b> <b>parameters</b> satisfies the specifications. Failing this, we seek new values of the <b>design</b> <b>parameters</b> for which statistical verification could poten-tially succeed. This is achieved through repeated simulations for various values of the <b>design</b> and stochastic <b>parameters,</b> and quantile regression to construct a model that predicts the spread of the responses {{as a function of the}} design pa-rameters. The resulting model is used to select a new set of values for the <b>design</b> <b>parameters.</b> We evaluate this approach over several benchmark examples. In each case, the performance is improved significantly compared to the nominal design. ...|$|R
