This research aims to extend {{the development of an}} initial simulation of behavioral choice to account for more of the complexities of animal behavior, including changes in behavioral state, and formation of social dominance hierarchies. We propose: � to develop the model in a modeling and simulation environment that will enable us to adopt more complex decision structures and test them individually or in batch model; � to study and compare several decision architectures that have been proposed over the past years; � to determine whether the multi-agent crayfish simulation can account for the behavior of a group of crayfish as they interact to form a dominance hierarchy.

40|$|Recent {{research}} on judgment {{and decision making}} emphasizes <b>decision</b> <b>architecture,</b> the task and contextual features of a decision setting that influence how preferences are constructed (Thaler & Sunstein, 2008). In {{a series of three}} papers, this dissertation considers architectural features related to the intertemporal structure of the decision setting that influence cognition, motivation, and emotion, and include modifications of (i) informational, (ii) experiential, (iii) procedural, and (iv) emotional environments. This research also identifies obstacles to decision making, whether that obstacle is an individual difference (e. g., age-related change in emotional processing) or a temporary state (e. g., a change in motivational focus, or sensitivity to irrelevant features of the decision setting). Papers 1 and 2 focus on <b>decision</b> <b>architecture</b> related to environmentally-relevant decisions, investigating how structural features of the decision task can trigger different choice processes and behavior. Paper 1 explores a potential mechanism behind constructed preferences relating to climate change belief and explores why these preferences are sensitive to normatively irrelevant features of the judgment context, such as transient outdoor temperature. Paper 2 examines new ways of emphasizing time and uncertainty with the aim of turning psychological obstacles into opportunities, accomplished by making legacy motives more salient to shift preferences from present-future and self-other trade-offs at the point of decision making. Paper 3 examines how the temporal horizon of a decision setting influences predicted future preferences within the domain of affective forecasting. In addition, Paper 3 explores how individual and situational differences might affect the match (or mismatch) between predicted and experienced outcomes by examining differences in forecasting biases among older versus younger adults. Taken together, these three papers aim to encourage individuals to make decisions that are not overshadowed by short-term goals or other constraints, with the aim of producing actionable modifications for policy-makers in the presentation of information relevant to such decisions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Software {{architecture}} is {{considered as a}} set of architectural design decisions (ADDs). Capturing and representing ADDs during the architecting process is necessary for reducing architectural knowledge evaporation. Moreover, managing the evolution of ADDs helps to maintain consistency between requirements and the deployed system. In this paper, we create the Triple View Model (TVM) as a general architecture framework for documenting ADDs. The TVM clarifies the notion of ADDs in three different views and covers key features of the architecting process. Based on the TVM, we propose a scenario-based methodology (SceMethod) to manage the documentation and evolution of ADDs. Furthermore, we also develop a UML metamodel that incorporates evolution-centered characteristics to manage ADDs evolution. We conduct a case study on an industrial project to validate the applicability and the effectiveness of the TVM, the SceMethod and the UML metamodel. The results show they provide complete documentation on ADDs for creating system architecture, and well support architecture evolution with changing requirements.

40|$|Maritime {{operations}} are affected significantly by meteorological and oceanographic (METOC) conditions. The availability of multiple METOC centres {{able to deliver}} more accurate forecasts {{in the near future}} (2 / 3 days) is a promising resource toward better operational planning. However, how a specific maritime operation can benefit from such forecasts is not straightforward. A <b>decision</b> support <b>architecture</b> is required to combine METOC forecasts and human knowledge and select the best action from a set of pre-defined actions for the maritime operation. This paper describes a <b>decision</b> support <b>architecture</b> developed at the NATO Undersea Research Centre that is an improvement over a previous version in two ways: i) it exploits forecasts coming from more than one METOC centre, and ii) it exploits uncertainty associated with METOC forecasts. The former allows for the exploitation of different abilities of METOC centres at different conditions. The latter allows for the propagation of input uncertainty on output products (the risks related to each action), thus allowing operators to assess if risks related to different actions are statistically different. Both features increase the robustness of the previous <b>decision</b> support <b>architecture.</b> The effectiveness of the new architecture is demonstrated on an underwater glider surfacing experiment carried out on data collected during a cruise in the Adriatic Sea in 2006...|$|R

The proposed SVM based Binary <b>Decision</b> Tree <b>architecture</b> takes advantage of both the efficient computation of the <b>decision</b> tree <b>architecture</b> and the high classification accuracy of SVMs. The performance of the proposed SVM-DTA was estimated on a problem of recognition of handwritten digits and letters.

The results of the experiments indicate that the proposed method is faster to be trained than the other methods. Also, due to its Log complexity, the proposed SVM-DTA is much faster than the widely used multi-class SVM methods like “one-against-one ” and “one-against-all”, maintaining comparable accuracy. The experiments also showed that this method becomes more favorable as the number of classes in the recognition problem increases.
