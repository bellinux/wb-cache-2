Hence we performed a 1 -year field study on organic pig farms, mapping egg contamination levels in pens and on pastures (dry sows, lactating sows and starters) and infection levels in animals. In conclusion, recovery of infective eggs was limited in deep litter compared to shallow litter, but many <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> <b>eggs</b> were still viable.

40|$|The general {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the economics of small-scale <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> system of <b>egg</b> production in Oredo Local Government Area Edo State, Nigeria. The Specific objectives are to determine the profitability in <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> system of poultry production among small-scale farmers, to examine the socioeconomic characteristics of egg producers and to identify the constraints to egg production in the study area. Primary and secondary data were obtained from farmers. A purposive sampling of small-scale egg producers was carried first in the study area. Then a simple random sampling technique was then employed to select 182 egg producers using a well-structured questionnaire from the entire population of small-scale farmers. Descriptive statistics such as means and percentages were using to examine the socioeconomic characteristics. The gross margin analysis was used to determine the profitability. While the constraints to egg production was analyzed using the likert scale technique. The result of the analysis reveals that the average number of birds raised in <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> is 760 birds. The study also shows that 68 % and 32 % of women and men produce eggs at this level respectively. The result of the study reveals that the fixed capital investment per bird was N 624. 17 and total fixed cost less depreciation per bird was N. 208. 88 and total variable cost per bird was N 331. 62. The study also reveals that total revenue from the sales of eggs per and other sources were N 3, 749. 22 per bird with a gross margin per bird of N 3, 417. 6 and a net profit of N 3, 208. 72.

Carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) are greenhouse gases taking part to the global problem of climate change. Ammonia (NH 3) emissions are responsible of soil acidification and eutrophication and contribute also to indirect emissions of N 2 O. This work evaluated the influence of the type of floor on the emissions of these gases in the raising of weaned pigs. Two trials were carried out. In the first trial, the animals were kept either on fully slatted floor or on straw-based <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> and, in the second one, either on fully slatted floor or on sawdust-based <b>deep</b> <b>litter.</b> For each trial and on each type of floor, 2 successive batches of weaned pigs were raised without changing the litter or emptying the slurry pit between the 2 batches. The rooms were automatically ventilated to maintain a constant ambient temperature. The performance of the animals was not significantly different according to the floor type. In trial 1, the nitrogen contents of the straw <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> (including the substrate) and slurry were respectively 276 and 389 g pig- 1. In trial 2, the sawdust <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> and slurry nitrogen contents were respectively 122 and 318 g pig- 1. Raising pigs on straw <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> produced proportionately around 100 % more NH 3 than raising pigs on slatted floor (0. 61 vs. 0. 31 g NH 3 -N d- 1 per pig; P< 0. 05). Differences in CO 2, H 2 O and CH 4 emissions were not significant between systems. Raising pigs on sawdust <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> produced also proportionately more NH 3 (+ 52 %; 0. 55 vs. 0. 36 g NH 3 -N d- 1 per pig; P< 0. 01) but also more CO 2 (+ 25 %; 427 vs. 341 g d- 1 per pig; P< 0. 001) and H 2 O (+ 65 %; 981 vs. 593 g d- 1 per pig; P< 0. 001) and less CH 4 (- 40 %; 0. 52 vs. 0. 86 g d- 1 per pig; P< 0. 001) than raising pigs on slatted floor.

40|$|<b>Deep</b> <b>litter</b> is {{a system}} for animals kept in {{separate}} stalls, loafing and bedding in wind shelters. The litter can consist of different bedding, like straw and peat. The system is allowed to build over and to ensure optimal proportions {{it is necessary to}} add new straw regularly and to have good conditions. Important conditions are aerobic state, humidity, amount of organic substance and acceptable temperatures in the litter. The micro organisms are depending on temperature for their living conditions and to get the bottom layer in the litter to start burning. When the burning has started the temperature increases. This help keeping the animals warm in buildings which are often not insulated. Deep liter is a good alternative for animals, because they can behave naturally. One down side of the system is that it has a bigger environmental impact than slatted floor. Ammonium is greatest concern, as it leeks to the air when mucking out and storing between mucking and distribution of the manure. When the concentration of ammonium increases it leaves into the air. This is also a risk when increase in temperature and pH occurs. As <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> is commonly used in buildings with natural ventilation, there is a risk of leakage to the air.

Means emissions were, respectively, 8214 g/day/cow, 0. 433 g/day/cow, 713 g/day/cow, and 97 g/day/cow for CO 2 -C, N 20 -N, CH 4 -C and NH 3 -N in P 1 and 8048 g/day/cow, 0. 468 g/day/cow, 627 g/day/cow, and 56 g/day/cow in P 2. These results (i) improve our understanding of emitting processes related to deep litters; (ii) highlight that too high animal stocking density on <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> will lead to higher GHG and ammonia emissions.

40|$|Pig {{production}} {{is an important}} contributor to polluting gases emissions like ammonia (NH 3) and greenhouse gases (GHG). Apart from environmental aspects, animal welfare is also an issue of growing importance. The fattening of pigs on <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> bedded system is consider as more animal friendly than the fattening on slatted floor, {{but it is also}} more expensive and requests more labour. The use of straw flow rather than straw <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> could be a good compromise because of a reduced need for surface area, straw, labour and manure storage, combined with satisfying animal welfare. In order to evaluate the environmental impact of this rearing technique, a study was designed to quantify pollutant gas emissions of this system compared to the <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> system for fattening pigs. Three successive batches of 32 Landrace fattening pigs were used. They were divided into 2 homogeneous groups of 16 animals randomly allocated to two treatments: straw <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> or straw flow. The groups were kept simultaneously for a period of 4 months and separately in two identical rooms in volume (103 m 3) and surface (30. 2 m 2) and fitted either with a <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> pen (1. 2 m 2 /pig) or with a straw flow system (0. 75 m 2 /pig). Throughout the fattening period, 46. 9 and 34. 4 kg straw were used respectively per pig. In <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> pen, the litter was removed after each batch. In the straw flow pen, the straw, mixed with dung, travelled down the slope by pig motion and went out of the pen to a scraped passage. The solid fraction was scraped every day, stored in a heap in the room and removed every month, 1 week before each period of gaseous emission measurement. The liquid fraction was automatically pumped from the scraped passage into a hermetic tank, which was emptied {{at the end of each}} fattening period. In both rooms, ventilation was automatically adapted to maintain a constant ambient temperature. Once a month, the emissions of ammonia (NH 3), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), methane (CH 4), carbon dioxide (CO 2), and water vapour (H 2 O) were measured continuously for 6 consecutive days by infra-red photoacoustic detection. Animal performance (final body weight, body weight gain, and feed conversion ratio), some carcass quality parameters and manure characteristics were not significantly affected by floor type. With fattening pigs kept in a straw flow pen, gaseous emissions were significantly greater (P < 0. 05) for NH 3 (+ 10 %) and significantly lower (P < 0. 001) for N 2 O (− 55 %), CH 4 (− 46 %), CO 2 equivalents (− 47 %), CO 2 (− 10 %) and H 2 O (− 23 %) compared to pigs housed on straw-based <b>deep</b> <b>litter.</b> Thus, the use of straw flow system for pig fattening allows reducing the GHG emissions but presents the disadvantage of increasing the NH 3 emissions.

40|$|Objective of this {{research}} was to present and compare results of the research of the effect of two fattening methods, on <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> and conventional method (without litter). Slaughter properties have been determined with special focus on distribution of certain tissues in pig carcasses fattened in two different ways. Research was carried out on meat, fattening pig breeds - Swedish landrace. Research included 115 fatteners from single farm in Vojvodina. Depending on the housing conditions, two groups were formed: first group - group I (60 heads in group) was housed on <b>deep</b> <b>litter,</b> and the second - group II (55 heads in group), without litter. At the end of the trial, pigs were slaughtered and dissection was performed on cooled (+ 4 ºC) left carcass sides and meat yield determined using the method of partial dissection (Walstra and Merkus, 1996). Carcass sides were cut in 12 parts. Based on the meat quantity in four main carcass parts: leg, shoulder, back-loin part (BLP) and belly-rib part (BRP), which contain 75 % of total musculature mass and mass of tenderloin of carcass side, meat percentage in carcass sides was calculated according to formulation (Manojlović Danica et al., 1999). Fatteners housed on <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> had statistically significantly (**p< 0. 01) lower mass of cool carcass sides (38. 38 kg) compared to fatteners housed without litter (40. 90 kg). Higher absolute and relative shares of leg (10. 22 kg and 25. 02 %) were established and higher absolute yield of shoulder (5. 35 kg) in fatteners housed in boxes without litter (II group). Yield of muscle tissue in leg, shoulder, BLP and BRP was higher in fatteners of the II group (without litter) compared to pigs fattened on <b>deep</b> <b>litter,</b> and also statistically highly significant differences were established in share of muscle tissue in shoulder (**p< 0. 01) and considerable differences in regard to share of muscle tissue in BRP (*p< 0. 05). Meat yield of pig carcass sides was determined by method of partial dissection, for fatteners housed on <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> it was 47, 92 %, and in case of fatteners housed without litter it was 53. 89 %. Established differences were very significant (**p< 0. 01) ...|$|R

Analyzed data showed that there was highly significant (P< 0. 01) house x sex interaction effects on live body weight. This means that body weight is house and sex dependent. Male and female birds reared inside the cage were superior in terms of body weight to those on <b>deep</b> <b>litter.</b> Generally, {{the rate of growth}} from third to seventh week was higher across both housing systems and sexes, but decreased after seventh week of age. In the same vein, There was highly significant (P< 0. 01) house x sex interaction effects on wing length, thigh length and breast girth of quail birds. It infers that these growth traits are house and sex dependent. Male and female birds reared inside the cage were superior in terms of body weight and other growth traits to those on <b>deep</b> <b>litter.</b> Since cage birds were restricted, they were able to utilize feeds given optimally leading to increase in muscle cells and body size. In essence, cage system of rearing produced more quail meat than <b>deep</b> <b>litter,</b> and should be considered for increased productivity and animal proteins supply...|$|R
40|$|Osteochondrosis (OC) {{is seen as}} {{the main}} cause of leg {{weakness}} in pigs, leading to welfare problems and economic losses. Environmental factors in pig husbandry, such as the housing system and feeding strategy are expected to influence the prevalence of OC. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of housing system and feeding strategy on the prevalence and severity of OC. In the experiment 345 pigs were used. At an age of 69 days intact boars and gilts were separated and assigned to groups of five or six individuals. A two by two factorial design of housing system and feeding strategy was applied. The housing system was either a conventional concrete floor partial slatted, or a <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> floor with extra space allowance. The feeding strategy was either ad libitum or restricted to 80 % of ad libitum. Pigs were slaughtered at the age of 161 – 176 days. In total, five joints of the left front and hind limbs were macroscopically assessed for OC on a five-point scale, ranged from no OC through (semi-) loose cartilage fragments. The prevalence of OC in the experimental population was 41. 4 %, and 12. 4 % of the individuals had severe lesions. The tarsocrural joint was most affected (30. 2 %) by OC. OC scores between the different joints were not correlated. Medial sections of joints were most affected (63 – 100 %). Boars were more affected than gilts in the elbow joint. Conventionally housed pigs were more affected than <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> housed pigs. Ad libitum fed pigs had more OC than restrictedly fed pigs. OC was most prevalent with 57. 5 % in the pigs on the conventional floor with ad libitum feeding. OC was least prevalent with 33. 7 % in pigs kept in <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> housing with restricted feeding. The sex, housing system and feeding strategy did not affect OC in the femoropatellar, metacarpophalangeal, and metatarsophalangeal joints. Our results demonstrate that the OC prevalence can be reduced by applying <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> floors with extra space allowance and/or restricted feeding in fattening pig...|$|R
40|$|Background Domesticated grazing animals {{including}} {{horses and}} donkeys are frequently housed using <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> bedding systems, {{where it is}} commonly presumed {{that there is no}} risk of infection from the nematodes that are associated with grazing at pasture. We use two different approaches to test whether equids could become infected with cyathostomines from the ingestion of <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> straw bedding. Methods Two herbage plot studies were performed in horticultural incubators set up to simulate three straw bedding scenarios and one grass turf positive control. Faeces were placed on 16 plots, and larval recoveries performed on samples of straw/grass substrate over 2 - to 3 -week periods. Within each incubator, a thermostat was set to maintain an environmental temperature of approximately 10 °C to 20 °C. To provide further validation, 24 samples of straw bedding were collected over an 8 -week period from six barns in which a large number of donkeys were housed in a <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> straw bedding system. These samples were collected from the superficial bedding at 16 sites along a “W” route through each barn. Results No infective larvae were recovered from any of the plots containing dry straw. However, infective cyathostomine larvae were first detected on day 8 from plots containing moist straw. In the straw bedding study, cyathostomine larvae were detected in 18 of the 24 samples. Additionally, in the two barns which were sampled serially, the level of larval infectivity generally increased from week to week, except when the straw bedding was removed and replaced. Conclusions We have demonstrated that equine cyathostomines can develop to infective larvae on moist straw bedding. It is therefore possible for a horse or donkey bedded in <b>deep</b> <b>litter</b> straw to become infected by ingesting the contaminated straw. This has implications for parasite control in stabled equids and potentially in housed ruminants, and further investigation is required in order to establish the relative infective pressure from pasture versus straw bedding...|$|R
