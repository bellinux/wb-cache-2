5|$|Naughty Dog based Drake's {{appearance}} and personality on daredevil Johnny Knoxville, actor Harrison Ford, and {{the heroes of}} pulp magazines, novels and films. To make him relatable, the character was dressed <b>in</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> a T-shirt, and given an everyman persona; he is strong-willed, and often jokes and quips. The designers focused on giving him realistic reactions to his environment; for example, he stumbles while running, barely clears objects during leaps, and recognizes the absurdity of the situations in which he finds himself.|$|E

He is dressed casually <b>in</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> windcheater. He sits on boxes as he begins to sing with a camera crew starting to film him. An image {{of a young woman}} is shown as he continues. Various personnel walk around him and adjust the set. Sebastian stands and the image of the female is seen again, she wears white feathers. Later, Sebastian is dressed more formally in a white suit as he performs the song. On this set are plasma screens depicting the same young woman.

500|$|After Carey Lowell {{was chosen}} to play Pam Bouvier, she watched many of the films in the series for inspiration. Lowell had {{described}} becoming a Bond girl as [...] "huge shoes to fill", as {{she did not see}} herself as a [...] "glamour girl", even coming to audition <b>in</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> a leather jacket. While Lowell wore a wig for the scenes set in the United States, a scene where Bouvier is given money and told by Bond to go and buy some new clothes (and, going off and doing so, also has her hair cut) was added so that Lowell's own short hair style could be used.|$|E
500|$|Carey {{performed}} [...] "Obsessed" [...] {{on several}} televised appearances since its release. On August 5, 2009, Carey performed the song {{live for the}} first time on the fourth season of the talent competition, America's Got Talent. Carey, appearing <b>in</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> a black top, was accompanied by several male dancers and three back-up singers. As she performed the song, the dancers hoisted her into the air several times, and carried her to several areas on the stage. During the performance, several white lights flashed, while monitors behind the dancers showed images of Carey and the video. Breanne Heldman from E! Entertainment Television criticized several aspects of the performance. She described the lighting as [...] "anxiety inducing", and wrote, [...] "That said, no one is doubting the singer's impressive set of pipes, but—frighteningly jarring lighting and quick edits aside—did she actually utilize them on 'America's Got Talent' last night?" [...] Aside from questioning the singers live vocals, she also felt Carey seemed [...] "robotic", and didn't show effort or interest in the performance. A reviewer from Idolator also was critical on the performance, asking if there was [...] "anything good about [...] ". He claimed Carey was lip-syncing, and described it as [...] "lackadaisical", and wrote, [...] "the backup dancers’ moves would have probably received a big red 'X' from at least one of the judges." ...|$|E

2500|$|With the {{decriminalization}} of male nudity, gay pornography {{became more}} mainstream in gay cultures, and Laaksonen's work along with it. By 1973, he was publishing erotic comic books and making inroads {{to the mainstream}} art world with exhibitions. In 1973 he gave up his full-time job at the Helsinki office of McCann-Erickson, an international advertising firm. [...] "Since then I've lived <b>in</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> lived on my drawings," [...] is how he described the lifestyle transition which occurred during this period.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cover of}} Save Rock and Roll {{features}} {{a photograph of}} two young boys—one wearing traditional Buddhist monk robes, the other <b>in</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> a T-shirt, smoking a cigarette—taken by Roger Stonehouse in Burma. The image was found {{early on in the}} production process, as the band scoured the Internet for inspirational images. The band members felt that the photo [...] "really solidified what [...] were trying to get across on the record: The idea of old and new clashing. Tradition and change coming together".|$|E

5000|$|The {{music video}} (directed by Jim Yukich) {{illustrates}} the artifice and false glamour of television advertisements. Collins {{commented that the}} video was designed to poke fun of the models <b>in</b> <b>jeans</b> commercials, <b>and</b> each verse refers to things that models in these commercials do. It begins with Collins (<b>in</b> blue <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> T-shirt) hitchhiking on a remote dusty road (in Hi Vista, California) when a speeding Porsche 911 goes by, it then reverses and the attractive women inside lets in a lizard instead, leaving Collins standing there. The ending is a parody of Michael Jackson's [...] "Black or White" [...] music video, depicting Collins imitating the [...] "Panther ending" [...] in which Jackson dances erratically. Banks and Rutherford eventually arrive to escort Collins off the set, at which point he goes limp {{and they have to}} drag him away.|$|R

[...] The duo was often seen in the backrooms of arenas with a poker table and later a framed doorway comically {{in the middle of}} the often large, open aired hallways; they insisted that anyone entering the space use the door. Occasionally, if the [...] "room" [...] was destroyed in one arena, it was set up exactly as it was destroyed at the next arena for comic effect.|$|E

Jim Shelley from the Daily Mail reviewed Carl's first two episodes, and called him [...] "a fairly undistinguished presence <b>in</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> a grey hoodie." [...] Shelley sarcastically wrote that [...] "He was also (you'll never guess) a menacing villain. EastEnders hasn't had a new one of those for, ooh, weeks." [...] On making his way around Albert Square to discover Ian stole his cash, Shelley wrote, [...] "Perhaps surprisingly, Carl was also such expert psychologist {{he should have been}} a master criminal rather than the petty criminal he really is, or working in Harley Street. Within 24 hours, this led him directly to his money and allowed him to negotiate an extortion rate from Ian of £500 a week plus all the free portions of Jean's Sausage Surprise he can eat. [...] It was pretty impressive for two episodes. [...] It turned out Carl was Bad News. What other kind is there in EastEnders? [...] Carl worked his magic on Ian, assessing his character and weakness, and manipulating him to get what he wanted with the skill of The Mentalist." [...] He went on to comment on Kirsty's line, [...] "He's someone you don't want in your life", saying, [...] "Or in your TV show." ...|$|E
