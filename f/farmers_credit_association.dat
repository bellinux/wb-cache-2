Specifically, {{the effects of the}} market share of <b>credit</b> <b>associations</b> in regional markets on their lending rates are empirically investigated. Accordingly, we determined that <b>credit</b> <b>associations</b> compete with each other in regional lending markets by using two different proxies for the market share held by <b>credit</b> <b>associations</b> in a region. The first proxy was the credit associations’ share of all deposits in a region and the second was the credit associations’ share of all branch offices in a region. In addition, <b>credit</b> <b>associations</b> that face more intense competition from regional banks in regional markets were found to face more intense competition from other <b>credit</b> <b>associations.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the economic role {{and performance of}} a type of financial institution that is observed worldwide: rotating savings and <b>credit</b> <b>associations.</b> Using a model in which individuals save for an indivisible durable consumption good, the authors study rotating savings and <b>credit</b> <b>associations</b> that distribute funds using random allocation and bidding. Each type of rotating savings and <b>credit</b> <b>association</b> allows individuals without access to credit markets to improve their welfare but, under a reasonable assumption on preferences, random allocation is preferred when individuals have identical tastes. This conclusion need not hold when individuals are heterogeneous. The authors also discuss the sustainability of rotating savings and <b>credit</b> <b>associations</b> given the possibility of default. Copyright 1993 by American Economic Association. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{interactions}} that exist among agricultural stakeholders in the southwestern highlands of Uganda as a way of identifying opportunities and gaps for operation of Innovation Platforms (IPs) under the proof of concept of Integrated Agricultural Research for Development (IAR 4 D) research project. The specific objectives were to (i) characterize the agricultural stakeholders in the study sites (ii) determine the nature, diversity and relative importance of horizontal and vertical networks that exist among stakeholders in the Southwestern Highlands of Uganda. Data were collected from both stakeholder analysis and household interviews in Kabale and Kisoro Districts. Results show that extension staff, local governments and farmer groups accounted for approximately 75 % of all categories of stakeholders in the area. Most of these organizations started after 10 to 15 years ago following the return of relative political stability in Uganda. Generally, stakeholder interactions in site with limited ARD intervention are more limited compared to their high-intervention counterparts. Sites with “good” market access have more institutions operating there but majority are isolated from each other. At household level, an individual household has networks with approximately two different organizations most of which are <b>farmer</b> groups or <b>credit</b> <b>associations.</b> The greatest proportion of horizontal networks that a household has is with fellow farmers. In order to make the value chain complete, establishment of IPs should pay special attention to including the private sector such as input and produce dealers. Facilitating IP actors to identify critical challenges and opportunities, and effectively articulate them will ensure cohesion. It is also critical to periodically monitor and evaluate stakeholders in terms of the quality of the networks to minimize conflict situations...|$|R

40|$|The role of {{co-operative}} <b>credit</b> <b>associations</b> in {{the field}} of organizing local circulation of money and small-scale credit as well as {{in the field}} of stimulating development of small-scale production follows from the position of peasantry and handicraft in the model of national economy. The state policy was changing in that sphere and that is the reason why some structural changes took place in the co-operative <b>credit</b> <b>associations,</b> which are presented in this article in three stages covering the years 1944 - 1949, 1950 - 1955, and 1956 - 1971. A new economic policy defined in the resolutions of the Central Comittee of the Polish United Workers' Party at the full sessions in 1970 and 1971 extends the participation of co-operative <b>credit</b> <b>associations</b> in providing finance for economic development considerably. In the article a skeleton program of mutual pecuniary aid as well as adjusted forms of organization and the technique of co-operative banking system are presented on the basis of the best experiences gained by the co-operative <b>credit</b> <b>associations</b> in the district of Poznań. By putting the experiences into practice the co-operative <b>credit</b> <b>associations</b> may be given a stimulus to a more effective employment of the population's resources and the co-operative resources to activize local communities in accord with the public interest while training them up to be thrifty united and disciplined.

Also, farmers in China are dispersed and their financial information is incomplete, which leads to credit risk evaluation system of farmers in China is not sound at all. Most Chinese banks even have not established the rating system, so <b>farmer</b> <b>credit</b> risk rating system pressed for solution. This study proposes an index screening method based on correlation analysis and significant discriminant. The proposed method is demonstrated using the 2044 petty loans for farmers of a Chinese state-owned commercial bank’s. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately screen the indicators, which can effectively distinguish default customers from non-default ones. Moreover, {{the results of an}} empirical study showed that “Loan purpose”, “Expenses / incomes”, “Increasing rate of regional GDP” are the key indicators to distinguish default customers from non-default ones.

This study aims at examining the operations of ROSCA in the Kumasi Metropolis, Ghana.
