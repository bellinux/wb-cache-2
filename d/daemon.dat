5|$|For {{many years}} FreeBSD's logo was the generic BSD <b>daemon,</b> also called Beastie, a {{distorted}} pronunciation of BSD. First appearing in 1976 on Unix T-shirts purchased by Bell Labs, {{the more popular}} versions of the BSD <b>daemon</b> were drawn by animation director John Lasseter beginning in 1984. Several FreeBSD-specific versions were later drawn by Tatsumi Hosokawa.|$|E
5|$|Tisiphone– The second sister, {{she often}} confounded Kratos with illusions and was aided by her familiar, <b>Daemon.</b> Although Kratos {{seemingly}} killed her in Delos, {{it was an}} illusion. She facilitated in Kratos' capture, but was killed by the Spartan along with Alecto. The character was voiced by Debi Mae West.|$|E
5|$|Behind {{the central}} {{images of the}} lunatic, <b>daemon</b> and gambler are {{a group of people}} who have only just {{realised}} what is happening. A male figure in a red Phrygian cap (a symbol of the French and American Revolutions) reclines with his arm around the waist of a female figure (identified as a bacchante by Sarah Burnage of the University of York). The female figure shades her eyes, either against the brightness of the angel or to block out the horror taking place in front of her.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of a {{graphical}} controller interface in the standard (non-server) Mac OS X distribution, it is possible to set up an Xgrid controller via the command line tools xgridctl and xgrid. Once the Xgrid controller <b>daemon</b> is running, administration of the grid with Apple's Xgrid Admin tool is possible. Some applications, such as VisualHub, provided Xgrid controller capability through their user interfaces.|$|E
5|$|In {{the centre}} of the {{foreground}} is a figure modelled on Caius Gabriel Cibber's Raving Madness, which at the time was one of two monumental sculptures above the entrance to Bethlem Hospital ("Bedlam"), and a well-known London landmark and symbol of insanity. The chained figure is contorted in agony struggling to escape his bonds, while a <b>daemon</b> pulls {{on one end of the}} chain. Beside this lunatic is an unconscious or dead gambler, his winnings spread on the floor beside him.|$|E
5|$|To {{the right}} of the painting, daemons drag terrified women away. The woman in the lower right hand corner turns to see flames {{reflected}} {{in the eyes of the}} <b>daemon</b> who holds her from behind, with a look of horrified guilt on her face. Behind her, other women struggle helplessly with the daemons or are carried away unconscious, having fainted.|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins with}} Kratos, who is imprisoned, chained, and tormented by the Furies for {{breaking}} his blood oath to Ares. The Fury Megaera tortures Kratos, but {{he manages to}} break free. Chasing her through the prison, he discovers that the prison itself is Aegaeon the Hecatonchires, the first traitor of the Furies who had broken a blood oath to Zeus; he was turned into the Prison of the Damned as punishment. Overcoming an illusion created by the Fury Tisiphone and her familiar <b>Daemon,</b> Kratos finds and kills Megaera, retrieving the Amulet of Uroborus, which the Furies had confiscated from {{him when he was}} imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|The lack of {{gameplay}} {{information was}} also criticized. Laura Parker found the trailer {{disconnected from the}} actual game, with the trailer being misleading by not showing any in-game information, and with the game failing to deliver the same emotional effect as the trailer. <b>Daemon</b> Hatfield from IGN similarly thought that the trailer was not useful in assessing the game's quality and expressed concerns that the game {{would not be as}} entertaining and interesting as the trailer. Upon release, many reviewers thought that the trailer had set expectation too high for the actual game, and that the game ended up not meeting expectations.|$|E
5|$|Back in {{the present}} time, Tisiphone and <b>Daemon</b> cast another {{illusion}} to deceive Kratos, who overcomes it and retrieves the Oath Stone of Orkos. He encounters the Scribe of Hecatonchires, who reveals that the Furies were originally fair in their punishment, but devolved into ruthless beings because of Ares. Continuing his pursuit of the Furies, Kratos reaches the door to Alecto's Chamber, but seemingly returns home {{to his wife and}} daughter: another illusion, this time cast by the Fury Queen Alecto. She tries to convince Kratos he can live within this illusion if he rejoins Ares, but he refuses. Enraged, Alecto and Tisiphone attack Kratos, who retrieves the eyes, and Alecto transforms into a giant sea monster. After a brutal battle, Kratos uses the eyes to break through the Furies' illusions before killing them both, which destroys the prison.|$|E

50|$|Greater <b>Daemons</b> are the {{ultimate}} expression of the might of the Chaos Gods. They normally appear as massive monsters of incredible power, sometimes able to fight an entire enemy army on their own. Some Greater <b>Daemons</b> have shown a degree of personality and free will, notably one from Warhammer 40,000 named M'kachen, a Lord of Change of Tzeentch. The Greater <b>Daemons</b> {{of the other three}} major Chaos Gods are the Bloodthirster of Khorne, the Great Unclean One of Nurgle, and the Keeper of Secrets of Slaanesh. Except for the Bloodthirster, all of the Greater <b>Daemons</b> are also powerful sorcerers in either game setting.|$|R
5|$|The {{domestic}} cat {{was first}} classified as Felis catus by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th {{edition of his}} Systema Naturae published in 1758. Because of modern phylogenetics, domestic cats are usually regarded as another subspecies of the wildcat, F. silvestris. This has resulted in mixed usage of the terms, as the domestic cat can be called by its subspecies name, Felis silvestris catus. Wildcats have also {{been referred to as}} various subspecies of F. catus, but in 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature fixed the name for wildcats as F. silvestris. The most common name in use for the domestic cat remains F. catus. Sometimes, the domestic cat has been called Felis domesticus as proposed by German naturalist J.C.P. Erxleben in 1777, but these are not valid taxonomic names and have been used only rarely in scientific literature. A population of Transcaucasian black feral cats was once classified as Felis <b>daemon</b> (Satunin 1904) but now this population {{is considered to be a}} part of domestic cat.|$|E
5|$|Twelve years later, the Kingsglaive {{fight to}} protect Lucis's borders from attacks by Niflheim's Magitek army and Daemons, unnatural monsters tamed for {{military}} use. During one such operation, Nyx Ulric defies his orders to withdraw to rescue his friend Libertus from a <b>Daemon.</b> Regis, whose magic powers the Wall and is growing weaker due to advancing age, accepts Imperial Chancellor Ardyn Izunia's offer of peace. This causes dissension among the Kingsglaive, who feel Regis is abandoning their families. Two {{days before the}} treaty is to be signed, Kingsglaive member Crowe is sent {{on a mission to}} escort Lunafreya to Lucis, but is killed en route. Her death causes Libertus to leave the Kingsglaive and join a group of Lucian rebels. At a party dedicated to the signing of the treaty, attended by both Regis and Niflheim's emperor Iedolas Aldercapt, Lunafreya meets with Nyx before being secretly abducted by Glauca. Nyx discovers this and finds that Niflheim has stationed their army outside Insomnia.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} May, {{the band}} entered Zero Return Studios in Atlanta with drummer Curt Wells as producer {{for their first}} album in almost a decade. On January 25, 2005, Magnapop released Mouthfeel on Amy Ray's record label <b>Daemon</b> Records and supported it with a tour through the United States. By 2005, Fletcher had left the group, and drummer Chad Williams had been recruited to replace him on two weeks prior to the first show on the Mouthfeel tour that included an appearance at South by Southwest. One of these performances was recorded for the band's first live album—Magnapop Live at Maxwell's 03/09/2005—which they released independently through online music distributors including eMusic, the iTunes Store, and Rhapsody. In May 2006, the band completed a tour of Belgium and The Netherlands and returned to Atlanta to begin work on the followup to Mouthfeel. They continued touring Europe in 2007 and completed writing and recording for a new album sometime prior to 2008, with the album initially slated {{to be released in}} summer 2009. These sessions recorded with Brian Paulson were released as Chase Park on September 4, 2009, through digital distributors by the band's own, newly created label, The Kraft Records.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was generally}} well received by reviewers. Famitsu generally praised the gameplay elements. One reviewer found the dual screen and mid-battle save features convenient, {{even though the}} latter diluted the tension of battle. Another felt that Shadow Dragon was the best Fire Emblem title to that date. 1UP.com's Kurtis Seid enjoyed the gameplay and strategic elements surrounding character management, but said that the multiplayer options risked upsetting the balance; {{he also noted that}} the inclusion of features for newcomers might alienate hardcore fans. Tom Bramwell, writing for Eurogamer, praised the overall feel of the game, from the dual screen functionality to the battle and character class systems, although noted nothing that elevated the game to new heights, and said that the inclusion of newcomer-friendly mechanics clashed with the permanent death mechanic. Shiva Stella of GameSpot enjoyed the tactical elements, openness to newcomers and multiplayer elements; but found the weakness of new recruits and map restrictions detracted from the experience. IGN's <b>Daemon</b> Hatfield, while again noting a lack of innovation, found {{it one of the most}} balanced strategy games available at the time. Stuart Reddick of Nintendo Life greatly enjoyed the gameplay experience and praised the developer's efforts at balancing the various elements, but noted that it felt dated compared to both later Fire Emblem titles and other recent titles within the genre. Fred Dutton of Official Nintendo Magazine was highly positive, praising the classic gameplay, new features, and multiplayer functions. His one major complaint was a lack of innovation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Daemon</b> throws off the attack, and spots Aoto Fujitsuna, the top {{official}} after whom {{the play was}} originally named, on a small bridge down below. Aoto explains that his men found the incense burner in the river, and intend to return it to its rightful owners. Relieved, <b>Daemon</b> resolves to ask to be arrested, but Aoto generously offers to instead let him be {{at least until the}} end of the memorial service of the late shogun; <b>Daemon</b> promises to turn himself in later in the day, and leaves.|$|E

50|$|What {{follows is}} a list of the major types of <b>daemons,</b> and brief {{description}} of each type. The list is not exhaustive, and where major differences exist between Warhammer 40,000 and Warhammer Fantasy, these will be noted. Most of the <b>daemons</b> shown below serve the four major Chaos Gods- Khorne, Nurgle, Slaanesh and Tzeentch, although the Warhammer 40,000 Daemonhunters army includes special rules to allow their opponent to field generic <b>daemons</b> not listed below, but similar to those listed.|$|R

25|$|The next scene {{takes place}} in this back room. Drunk, Tamashima draws his sword and reveals himself as Nippon <b>Daemon</b> in a rousing speech, before {{demanding}} Kōbei hand over {{all the money in}} the shop. Though Rikimaru and Kozō have made off with 100 ryō, the entire ordeal was a ruse to help <b>Daemon</b> earn Kōbei's trust, and to get himself into the back room. Sōnosuke throws himself between the two, offering his own life instead of that of his father-in-law; <b>Daemon</b> stops, noting that he once had a son who would be roughly Sōnosuke's age. The two older men begin to talk about their pasts and come to the realization that not only is <b>Daemon</b> Sōnosuke's true father, but Kōbei is in fact Kozō's true father. Both men, for differing reasons, lost their sons at a crowded ritual ceremony at the Hase-dera over a decade prior, and agree to forget about Daemon's criminal scheme as they thank one another for taking care of one another's sons, though Kōbei does ask that <b>Daemon</b> attempt to turn all five of the thieves away from their lives of crime.|$|E
