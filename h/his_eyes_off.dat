25|$|The RSM marches {{around to}} the front of the Escort and, {{followed}} by the Ensign, approaches the Colour Party. Having saluted the colour with his sword, the Sergeant-Major takes it from the Colour Sergeant, freeing him to change and then slope arms. The RSM turns, marches to the Ensign, and presents the colour to him. The Ensign salutes the colour with his sword, sheathes the sword without taking <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the colour, and takes possession of it.|$|E
25|$|Then {{came the}} rematch with Bowe on November 6, 1993. In what is {{considered}} by many sporting historians {{as one of the most}} bizarre moments in boxing's history, during round seven the crowd got off their feet and many people started to run for cover and yell. Holyfield took <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> Bowe for one moment and then told Bowe to look up to the skies. What they saw was a man in a parachute flying dangerously close to them. The man almost entered the ring, but his parachute had gotten entangled in the lights and he landed on the ropes and apron of the ring, and he was then pulled into the crowd, where he was beaten by members of Bowe's entourage. Bowe's pregnant wife, Judy, fainted and had to be taken to the hospital from the arena. Twenty minutes later, calm was restored and Holyfield went on to recover his world heavyweight titles with a close 12 round majority decision. The man who parachuted down to the middle of the ring became known as The Fan Man and the fight itself became known as the Fan Man Fight. His victory over Bowe that year helped Holyfield being named as ABC's Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year for 1993.|$|E
500|$|Another [...] "major {{recurring}} role" [...] debuts in this episode: Eric Bruskotter {{joins the}} cast as Cooter Menkins, [...] "a football recruiter who comes scouting for talent at McKinley, but finds he can’t take <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the team’s gruff but big-hearted coach." [...] Other recurring guest stars {{that appear in}} the episode include football coach Shannon Beiste (Jones), the focus of Cooter's eyes, former prom king Dave Karofsky (Adler), exchange student and new glee club member Rory Flanagan (Damian McGinty), and Mike's parents Julia Chang and Mike Chang, Sr. (Tamlyn Tomita and Sim).|$|E

5000|$|Davy Russell rode 50/1 shot Alfa Beat, {{who fell}} at the Foinavon fence, and said afterward: [...] "I was lucky {{at the first}} because he slithered {{into the back of}} it. At the seventh he just took <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>off</b> the fence and that was it." ...|$|R
500|$|Sutcliffe {{was fascinated}} by the trio, but {{especially}} Kirchherr, and thought they looked like [...] "real bohemians". Bill Harry later said that when Kirchherr walked in, every head would immediately turn her way, and that she always captivated the whole room. Sutcliffe wrote to a friend that he could hardly take <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> her and had tried to talk to Kirchherr during the next break, but she had already left the club. Sutcliffe managed to meet them eventually, and learned that all three had attended the Meisterschule, which was the same type of art college that Lennon and Sutcliffe had attended in Liverpool. (Note: Meisterschule für Mode, Textil, Grafik und Werbung , although it is now called the University of Applied Sciences).|$|E
500|$|As per Priyadas' account, Tulsidas {{followed}} {{the instruction of}} Hanumana and started living in an Ashram at Ramghat in Chitrakuta. One day Tulsidas went to perform the Parikrama (circumambulation) of the Kamadgiri mountain. He saw two princes, one dark and the other fair, dressed in green robes pass by mounted on horsebacks. Tulsidas was enraptured at the sight, however he could not recognise them and took <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> them. Later Hanuman asked Tulsidas if he saw Rama and his brother Lakshmana on horses. Tulsidas was disappointed and repentful. Hanuman assured Tulsidas {{that he would have}} the sight of Rama once again the next morning. Tulsidas recalls this incident in a song of the Gitavali and laments how [...] "his eyes turned his own enemies" [...] by staying fixed to the ground and how everything happened in a trice.|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr, Klaus Voormann, and Jürgen Vollmer were early {{fans of the}} Beatles {{after they}} heard the group play in the Kaiserkeller. Kirchherr, Voormann's girlfriend, was {{initially}} horrified {{at the idea of}} spending any time in such a sordid district, but Voormann, after watching the Beatles several times without her, eventually persuaded her to come too. After having previously only listened to Trad jazz, the Platters, and Nat King Cole, the Rock n' Roll that the Beatles played was totally new to them. The three friends visited the Kaiserkeller almost every night, arriving at 9 o'clock and sitting by the front of the stage. Kirchherr, then 22 years old, later said: [...] "It was like a merry-go-round in my head, they looked absolutely astonishing... My whole life changed in a couple of minutes. All I wanted was to be with them and to know them." [...] Sutcliffe was fascinated by Kirchherr, and Harry later wrote that when Kirchherr walked in, every head would immediately turn her way. Sutcliffe wrote to a friend that he could hardly take <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> her when she had first walked into the club, and tried to talk to her during the next break, but she had already left.|$|E

60|$|She {{took about}} three-quarters of {{an hour to get}} ready, but when she came down, Ginger felt that it was quite worth it. He couldn't take <b>'is</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> 'er, as the saying goes, and 'e sat by 'er side {{on the top of the}} omnibus like a man in a dream.|$|R
60|$|At last, {{when most}} of his {{followers}} had fallen, Sir Richard Fulke made a sudden dash through his assailants, and fled up the stairs towards {{the door on the}} roof. Rupert, who had never for a moment taken <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>off</b> him, followed at full speed, shouting to Hugh to bring torches and follow.|$|R
500|$|When not {{travelling}} overseas on cricket tours, Harvey {{played baseball}} in the winter for the Fitzroy Baseball Club. He was twice named in the Australian baseball team but the team was named only for the distinction accorded on the players. That is, they never competed. Harvey's fielding abilities were regarded by Wisden as the [...] "finest outfielder in the world" [...] during his career. As a baseball infielder Harvey developed a half round arm throw; its speed and accuracy caused many batsmen to be run out while attempting a run. Ray Robinson said that Harvey's throw was [...] "arrow-like" [...] in accuracy and that [...] "as a versatile fieldsman, this ball-hawk...takes top place". His baseball training also influenced his habit of catching the ball above head height, with which he rarely dropped catches. This {{was based on the}} theory that the fielder need never take <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the ball and, if it were to bounce out of his hands, he would have time to attempt to grab the rebound. Harvey also covered ground quickly and possessed and efficient method of picking up and returning the ball. From late 1958 when Norm O'Neill made his Test debut until Harvey's retirement in 1963, the duo formed a formidable pairing in the covers, helping to restrict opposition batsmen from scoring in the region.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, McAleer proved a strong performer. A later {{newspaper}} account {{described him as}} an outstanding outfielder who was [...] "blessed with excellent speed". The article noted that McAleer's skills as a sprinter helped him steal 51 bases in one year and 41 in another. According to some accounts, he was [...] "the first centerfielder to take <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> a fly ball, run {{to the spot where}} it fell to earth, and catch it". Less proficient as a hitter, McAleer accumulated a lifetime batting average of [...]253. During his career, the league's batting (pitchers removed) average for players with the same home field was [...]284. On April 24, 1894, he assisted in Cleveland's 1–0 victory over Cincinnati with a single in the ninth that drove home Buck Ewing, who had doubled. Along with teammates Cy Young, Jesse Burkett, John Clarkson, and Charles Zimmer, McAleer also participated in the Spiders' victory over the Baltimore Orioles in the 1895 Temple Cup, a post-season series between first and second-place teams of the National League. The Spiders placed second to the Orioles at the close of both the 1895 and 1896 seasons. McAleer's performance came in spite of a serious injury he received during a game held in Philadelphia on August 24, 1895, when he collided with a fence. Furthermore, he balanced his achievements in sports with a foray into politics in his hometown of Youngstown. During the summer of 1895, McAleer was promoted in the local media as a mayoral candidate, first as a Republican, and then as an independent. Further research is required to determine the depth of his involvement in politics.|$|E
500|$|Homer and Marge are {{scheduled}} to do a singing toast at their cousin Valerie's wedding, causing Marge to become nervous, due to her fear of embarrassment. Homer tells her not to worry, saying that he will {{make sure they do}} not mess up. Homer gets a fortune cookie stating that today will be his lucky day, but he does not believe so. However, he starts to believe this occurs when he crashes into a vending machine causing all of the snacks to fall out on him, and finds an Emerson, Lake & Palmer CD in the parking lot. He sings along to [...] "Lucky Man", driving recklessly to the synthesizer solo. He then goes to the Kwik-E-Mart for a lottery ticket, even though he has to go to the wedding and sing with Marge. After a long wait, Homer gets his lottery ticket, only to find out the wedding has ended. When he takes <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the road for a second, he crashes off the ramp. Homer wakes up in the hospital after the crash, and realizes he won a million dollars in the lottery. Homer does not want Marge to know he missed the wedding to get a lottery ticket, and has Barney pose as the winner. So that Marge does not know he won the money, he secretly leaves gifts for his family members. However, when Homer tries to get money out of the tree where he hid the money, Bart discovers that he won the lottery. Threatening to tell Marge, Bart demands that Homer publicly embarrasses himself, does unethical tasks, and becomes a victim of his own son. Eventually, Homer decides to tell Marge himself and get it over with. Taking Marge on a hot-air balloon, he reveals he won the lottery, causing Marge to become very glad and not furious about his absence at the wedding; he tells her he spent it all, leaving them poor as usual. However, Marge does not care, saying at least they have each other. Homer then reveals he spent the last of the money on a giant cherry blossom grove in the shape of Marge's face with the words [...] "Love of my Life". They then sing the song they were supposed to sing at the wedding together, off in the sunset.|$|E

500|$|In 1986, Cockayne {{decided to}} alter {{products}} for release on 16-bit consoles, since smaller 8-bit consoles, {{such as the}} ZX Spectrum, lacked the processing power for larger strategy games. The decision was falsely interpreted by video game journalist Phillipa Irving as [...] "pulling out" [...] from the Spectrum market. Following years of successful sales throughout the mid-1980s, Personal Software Services experienced financial difficulties, and Cockayne admitted in a retrospective interview that [...] "he took <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>off</b> the ball". The company was acquired by Mirrorsoft in February 1987, and was later dispossessed due to debt.|$|R
