5000|$|As an overlay system, InSync’s {{hardware}} components {{plug into}} existing traffic cabinet hardware. The system is Ethernet- and web-based, compatible with all modern controllers, cabinets and detection devices {{and does not}} require removal or upgrades of any hardware or software. Installation of the InSync system consists of installing in each cabinet a processor, <b>equipment</b> <b>panel</b> and method to transmit detection calls (such as cabling or detector cards). If InSync’s video detection is used, installation also includes installing cameras for each approach. If existing detection methods are preferred (InSync:Tesla), Rhythm Engineering will integrate the installed inputs with the adaptive system. Once cables are pulled from the camera locations to the traffic cabinet, installation of the cameras and in-cabinet hardware typically requires about four hours per intersection. After the hardware is installed, the initial configuration {{of the system is}} performed by Rhythm Engineering engineers. The time from an agency or contractor ordering the system to full operation is less than 90 days.|$|E

Its purpose is to maintain all the components of a spacecraft within their respective temperature limits. In general, the thermal control system is composed of two different types of systems the passive and active. Multilayer Layer Insulation (MLI) is the most common thermal-control elements on spacecraft. MLI is considered as a passive type. MLI blankets prevent both excessive heat loss from a component and excessive heating from environmental fluxes, rocket plumes, and other sources SC model in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is created by thermal desktop program, in order to launch a parametric study to check design of thermal control elements (Radiators, Heaters, MLI) by calculating the temperature field along the <b>equipment</b> <b>panel</b> and verify that the maximum and minimum temperature of the lower sheet of the panel is within the design range of temperature from 0 ˚C up to 35 ̊C.

40|$|An {{effective}} investigation of alternative control {{strategies for the}} reduction of vibration levels in satellite structures requires realistic, yet effective, structural models to simulate {{the dynamics of the}} system. These models should include the effects of the sources, receivers, supporting structure, sensors, and actuators. In this paper, a modeling technique which meets these requirements is developed and some active control strategies briefly investigated. The particular subject of investigation is an <b>equipment</b> loaded <b>panel</b> and the equations of motion are developed using the Lagrange-Rayleigh-Ritz (LRR) approach. The various pieces of <b>equipment</b> on the <b>panel</b> are mounted on active or passive suspensions, and resonators are used to represent the internal dynamics of the mounted equipment. Control of the panel, which transmits vibrations from sources to receivers, is by means of piezoelectric patches and the excitation consists of dynamic loads acting on the equipment encloseures and/or directly on the panel. The control objective is to minimize the displacement at an arbitrary output location. The LRR model developed is verified against one produced by an appropriate Finite Element Method. Finally, some initial controller design studies are undertaken to investigate and compare the effectiveness of different control strategies (eg minimization at the source, along the vibration path, or at the receiver) ...|$|R

These parameters have been incorporated into a program that was developed to assess the feasibility of using pre-driven recovery roadways.

40|$|In recent years, {{there have}} been new odour {{assessment}} tools available to help municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) understand their off-site odour impact, such as dispersion modelling, portable odour measurement <b>panel</b> <b>equipment,</b> electronic noses, air tracer compounds, and odour sensors {{that can be used}} to measure ambient odours at the plant fenceline. However, perception of odours is highly subjective, individuals might have different responses to an odour at various concentration and duration. Many WWTPs have serious concerns about off-site odour impacts that are causing them to look for viable odour controls to meet community needs for an odour-free environment. This paper presents ways to demonstrate compliance with community odour standards using dispersion modelling, direct fenceline ambient sampling, and portable odour measurement equipment. Hand-held ambient odour and hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) measurement devices were evaluated, and they compared favorably to odour dispersion modelling results for a mid-sized WWTP in the United States. Other methods, such as the electronic nose, were reviewed but not included in this paper because they are better suited for sampling at the odour emission source than for ambient sampling. Electronic noses also tend to have high detection limits for known odourous compounds emitted at a WWTP, which means that the typical WWTP odourous emission concentrations emitted may not be detected by the device. This paper provides insight into ambient sampling approaches using hand-held devices instead of other methods or approaches, including dispersion modelling and/or direct emissions source testing, to determine a WWTP’s off-site odour impacts. Results from this innovative approach, which relies on recent innovations in portable, odour measurement <b>panel</b> <b>equipment,</b> show that a simple strategy exists to prioritize odour sources for controls. The dispersion model results in the case study, using source-measured inputs, were verified at the fenceline using data gathered with hand-held ambient odour measurement and metering devices. 1...|$|R
