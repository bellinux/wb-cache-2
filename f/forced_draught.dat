5|$|In the sub-basement {{were the}} Sprague screw {{machines}} for the electric elevators, the fire pumps, the house pumps, the ice plant, {{and the six}} Babcock & Wilcox waler tube boilers. The elevator system, which served the house from subbasement to roof, was electric, taking its power from the generating plant within the building. There were 18 elevators. The machinery was located in the sub-basement. The boilers aggregated about 3,000 horse power, the electric generators taking 2,200 horse-power of the total energy. The elevators were run by it, as were the 15,000 incandescent lamps, branching from 7,500 outlets. The system of heating and ventilating the public rooms was that of <b>forced</b> <b>draught</b> by means of powerful blowers situated in the sub-basement that forced the fresh air between steam-coils, where it became moderately heated before entering the ducts that lead it to the various rooms.

40|$|Surface {{spreading}} of slurry {{leads to}} the inevitable emission of ammonia into the environment. Injection of slurry on grassland reduces these emissions. However, injection of slurry by deep working injector tines with goose foot chisels (wings) requires high <b>draught</b> <b>forces.</b> This type of injection has {{the risk of the}} crop dying back under dry soil conditions and is not possible on all soil types. In recent years, new slurry application techniques for grassland have been developed that achieve a large reduction in emissions of ammonia, but require less <b>draught</b> <b>force.</b> These techniques include cutting a shallow slit in the sward, into which slurry is applied, and application of the slurry in bands on the soil surface using a trailing foot implement. In a series of experiments on sandy loam, day and peat soils, the <b>draught</b> <b>force</b> requirement of single elements of five new slurry application techniques was investigated. The application techniques were a trailed sliding foot element and four shallow injection elements: angled-disc coulters (double-disc opener), thick-disc coulter, flat disc coulter followed by a vertical injection coulter and knife coulter followed by a vertical injection coulter. The application technique, working depth and soil conditions had a significant influence on the <b>draught</b> <b>force.</b> For a working depth of 5 cm, the required <b>draught</b> <b>forces</b> per shallow injector element, measured in this experiment, were in the range of 202 - 706 N for a double-disc opener, 284 - 991 N for a thick-disc coulter, 361 - 1260 N for a flat-disc coulter plus injector and 389 - 1358 N for a knife coulter plus injector.

25|$|<b>Forced</b> <b>draught</b> — A {{mechanical}} draft tower with {{a blower}} type fan at the intake. The fan forces {{air into the}} tower, creating high entering and low exiting air velocities. The low exiting velocity is much more susceptible to recirculation. With the fan on the air intake, the fan is more susceptible to complications due to freezing conditions. Another disadvantage is that a forced draft design typically requires more motor horsepower than an equivalent induced draft design. The benefit of the forced draft design {{is its ability to}} work with high static pressure. Such setups can be installed in more-confined spaces and even in some indoor situations. This fan/fin geometry is also known as blow-through.|$|E
25|$|Before {{her next}} voyage, a {{virtually}} new crew had been signed on - {{of the crew}} of 47, only eight men {{had been on the}} previous voyage. This eight included Captain Grimstone and his three deck officers, the mate John Elliot, William Hickson the gun layer, two other gunners and the ship steward. On Friday 24 October, in the early afternoon the English Trader left the Thames for what would be her last voyage. By late afternoon she had reached Southend on Sea. Here the Thames estuary was wide enough for convoys to form up in relative safety. Convoy EC90 was made up of 20 ocean-going freighters, two or three coastal steamers and two Royal Navy destroyers, one of which was the ageing HMS Vesper. Convoy EC90 set off on its voyage in single file to start with, proceeding at a steady eight knots. For the English Trader this was close to her maximum speed with a crew who knew how to get the best from her, which the new crew did not. The convoy's route took it up the east coast of England and around the top of Scotland and down into the Atlantic Ocean. The English Channel was far too hazardous for shipping convoys {{at this stage of the}} war. By 3 pm, the English Trader's troubles had begun. She had been running sluggishly, which had been noticed by the crew members from previous voyages. She was now a least a half a mile behind the bulk of the convoy and HMS Vesper was enquiring for the reasons for the poor speed of the ship. The speculation from the more experienced crew members was that the English Traders coal-fired boilers, which were <b>forced</b> <b>draught</b> fed, required the booster fans to be precisely set. It was agreed that the ill-experienced new crew and the new chief engineer were unable to accomplish this. The captain was told by the commodore aboard the Vesper that if she could not regain her position in the convoy by nightfall she should make for harbour at one of the east coast ports.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} the cutting parameters of a blade on the tillage force components using finite element modeling. A three-dimensional model was carried out with Abaqus Explicit in order to study the interaction between the tool and soil. The soil was modeled with linear forms of the Drucker-Pager model, while the tool was considered as a rigid body with a reference point taken at its tip. The effect of tillage depth and the width of a vertical blade were studied. It was found that the amounts of the <b>draught</b> and vertical <b>forces</b> increase linearly with a slope of 0. 037 and 0. 0143 respectively when the width increases. The narrow tool (width< 60 mm) has a greater effect on the specific <b>draught</b> <b>force</b> than a larger tool. Draught and specific <b>draught</b> <b>force</b> increase with polynomial and linear curve respectively versus the depth. However, this effect was reduced for the vertical force. These results were in a good agreement with previously published works. The second part of this paper is focused on the oblique position of the blade to evaluate {{the effect of the}} attack angles on both the tillage <b>forces</b> (<b>draught,</b> lateral and vertical) and the cutting process of the soil during and after its failure. For all considered angles, the <b>draught</b> <b>force</b> presents the highest values compared to the vertical and lateral forces.

50|$|And from March 2008 {{the firing}} of her boiler became more {{environmentally}} friendly. From her launch in 1859 she had been coal fired, but she now uses Blazer Logs, commercially produced blocks made from compressed sawdust. These burn more efficiently, giving off little smoke with negligible sulphur content and are carbon neutral. The cylinders exhaust to atmosphere after first passing through a silencer. The draught induced by the steam is used to draw the heat and waste products of combustion through the boiler and up the funnel, and so draw more air into the furnace, a <b>force</b> <b>draught</b> system. Now that the ship is using a different fuel to fire the boiler, however, a flue damper has also been fitted to produce a finer tolerance of control in the firebox. This uses less fuel to produce more steam, and hence delivers much greater economy.|$|R
40|$|Keywords: manure application, ammonia volatilization, {{environmental}} conditions, application technique, incorporation technique, <b>draught</b> <b>force,</b> work organization, costs Livestock manure applied on farmland is {{an important}} source of ammonia (NH 3) volatilization, and NH 3 is a major atmospheric pollutant. The need arose for more quantitative knowledge about NH 3 volatilization and for practical tools to reduce the NH 3 volatilization from manure. A database of field measurements was analysed to identify factors that effect the volatilization of NH 3 from manure applied by various techniques on grassland and arable land. The analyses showed that NH 3 volatilization is substantially reduced by application techniques like narrow band application and shallow injection, and by effective manure incorporation techniques. Also the manure composition, the application rate and the weather conditions substantially influenced the NH 3 volatilization rate. <b>Draught</b> <b>force</b> required for different application techniques on grassland varied considerably. The design of the shallow injection element, the working depth and soil circumstances had a substantial influence on the required <b>draught</b> <b>force.</b> For the trailing foot a lower <b>draught</b> <b>force</b> was required than for shallow injection. On arable land the time-lag between application and incorporation of the manure substantially affected the total NH 3 volatilization.

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to compare the {{performance}} and the costs of alternative tillage systems and machinery, in both energy and economic terms. To determine the energy requirements of tillage implements, experimentation in field conditions and controlled laboratory was conducted. Costs of alternative implements and complete systems were analysed. The field experiment was undertaken to determine the performance of tillage implements in real conditions. <b>Draught</b> <b>force</b> and area of disturbance of the implements were measured and specific resistance calculated. The implements involved in the experiment were 4 furrow mouldboard plough, 3 furrow disc plough, disc harrow and 7 winged tines. The mouldboard plough was operating at two different depths. Two tractors were used for execution of the implement and the wheel slip was measured. The soil bin studies were conducted in additional evaluation of the implements. The laboratory conditions ensure the uniformity of each test. The experiment was carried out to determine <b>draught</b> <b>force,</b> area of disturbance and specific resistance. The experiment involved single furrow mouldboard plough, disc plough, disc harrow and winged tines. Winged tines were made up of four different wing widths. Finally, an economic cost calculator was developed to compare the costs of different implements and tillage systems. Technical parameters and current prices of the implements were obtained from the manufacturers. The results from the field experiment show that there is a similar <b>draught</b> <b>force</b> per unit implement for mouldboard and disc ploughs, while <b>draught</b> <b>force</b> of mouldboard plough is significantly higher. The tillage efficiency of all implements is similar, with a mean of specific resistance of 58 kN/m 2 and a range of 15 kN/m 2. In the soil bin the vertical force preventing penetration occurred for disc plough and disc harrow. The specific resistance of the mouldboard plough had the lowest value, while the specific resistance of disc plough was higher by a factor of 1. 65. By increasing the wing width of the tines the <b>draught</b> <b>force</b> was increased but the specific resistance decreased.
