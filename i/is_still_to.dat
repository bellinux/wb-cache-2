5|$|Although modern fantasy {{may often}} embrace strangeness, the Ice and Fire series is {{generally}} praised {{for what is}} perceived as a sort of medieval realism. Believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre, Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters. Though the amount of magic has gradually increased throughout the story, the series <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>to</b> end with less overt magic than most contemporary fantasies. In Martin's eyes, literary effective magic needs to represent strange and dangerous forces beyond human comprehension, not advanced alien technologies or formulaic spells. As such, the characters understand only the natural aspects of their world, but not the magical elements like the Others.|$|E
5|$|During the Williamite Wars of 1690–1691, the {{garrison}} espoused {{the cause of}} James II in contrast with that of Birr, which took the side of William. A stone bridge across the Shannon was erected in 1685, and a Williamite army advancing from Birr in 1690 attempted to break it down but abandoned the attempt as too risky in consequence {{of the presence of}} Sarsfield's Army on the Connacht side. A broken arch of this bridge <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>to</b> be seen on that side a few yards below the present bridge of seven arches, which was erected by the Commissioners for the Improvement of Navigation of the Shannon in 1841–1843. The square tower on the lower side of the bridge at the Galway end was erected to protect the old bridge, as was the Salt Battery, with emplacements for four cannons facing west and north, a few hundred yards from town along the Crank Road.|$|E
5|$|The Llanbadarn tithes {{were not}} easy to collect: both the {{fishermen}} and the farmers of north Cardiganshire strongly resented the payments {{they had to make}} in goods, while the goods themselves (fish, corn, farm stock etc.) were {{not easy to}} collect and had to be sold for the money to pass to the Chichesters. It was easy for agents and collectors to line their own pockets, and {{to take advantage of the}} now-widowed Catherine by withholding their accounts. In 1727, she travelled to Cardiganshire by herself to claim her legal rights and stayed over winter. She then had to do so again in 1730: all her efforts were met with blank refusals and lies. During her long periods of forced residence she witnessed the beaching of ninety porpoises at Aberystwyth which were slaughtered by the local people. Her final journey to Wales in 1734 proved fatal, and she died in the county: a slate memorial to her <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>to</b> be seen above the vestry door in Llanbadarn church.|$|E

The first silk mill was burned down (along witrh Nottingham Castle) in the Reform Bill riots of 1831.

25|$|Since its opening, Lenox Square has {{undergone}} four major renovations and expansions. During {{the years following}} {{the opening of the}} shopping mall, several new retail centers opened up in several suburban locations, notably Perimeter Mall and Cumberland Mall. As a response to increasing competition, Lenox Square underwent a major renovation and expansion in the early 1970s that would have the entire shopping center enclosed. The renovation included a new wing and the addition of the first Neiman Marcus location outside of Texas and Florida. It <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>to</b> this day the company's only location in the state.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} reorganisation, Perón {{turned it into}} a {{political}} matter with the nationalisation becoming a symbol of national autonomy and independence from foreign powers rather than an administrative change and <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>to</b> this day regarded by justicialists as a move against neo-imperialsm. Although for many years the state-owned railways were able to provide a good standard of passenger and freight service, over the years the changing politics of Argentina began to take its toll. By the 1960s, the post-war economic boom had ushered in a new age of the automobile, with rail transport on its way out around the world, a trend from which Argentina was not left unscathed.|$|E

25|$|In 2015, it was {{reported}} that Broadway producer Kevin McCollum (who has previously produced the musicals Rent and Avenue Q amongst others) had signed a deal two years earlier with Fox to develop some of the movies from its back catalog into musicals for the stage. He expressed particular interest in Mrs. Doubtfire and The Devil Wears Prada. Early in 2017, it was officially announced by McCollum that in partnership with Fox Stage Productions and Rocket Entertainment, a musical version of The Devil Wears Prada (influenced by both the movie and the book) would be produced. Sir Elton John (who also wrote the scores for Billy Elliot and The Lion King amongst others) was announced as the composer for the project and Paul Rudnick (most notable for writing the movie Sister Act) would write the lyrics and story. The casting and production schedule <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>to</b> be announced but it is aimed to play on Broadway.|$|E
25|$|The {{right for}} bilingual {{topographic}} signs for the regions where Slovene and Croat Austrians live alongside the German-speaking population (as {{required by the}} 1955 State Treaty) <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>to</b> be fully implemented {{in the view of}} some, while others believe that the treaty-derived obligations have been met (see below). Many Carinthians are afraid of Slovenian territorial claims, pointing to the fact that Yugoslav troops entered the state after each of the two World Wars and considering that some official Slovenian atlases show parts of Carinthia as Slovene cultural territory. The recently deceased governor, Jörg Haider, has made this fact a matter of public argument in autumn 2005 by refusing {{to increase the number of}} bilingual topographic signs in Carinthia. A poll by the Kärntner Humaninstitut conducted in January 2006 states that 65% of Carinthians are not in favour of an increase of bilingual topographic signs, since the original requirements set by the State Treaty of 1955 have already been fulfilled according to their point of view.|$|E
