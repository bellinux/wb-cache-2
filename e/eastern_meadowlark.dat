50|$|Lilian's meadowlark (Sturnella magna lilianae) is {{a bird in}} {{the family}} Icteridae.It is found in {{northern}} Mexico and the southwestern portion of the United States. It is most often treated as a subspecies of the <b>eastern</b> <b>meadowlark</b> by many taxonomic authorities.|$|E
50|$|The preserve, {{acquired}} in 1975 by the land conservation non-profit organization The Trustees of Reservations, {{is suitable for}} hiking, horseback riding, picnicing, and cross country skiing; it is also maintained as habitat for ground nesting birds such as the bobolink, red-winged blackbird, and <b>eastern</b> <b>meadowlark.</b>|$|E
50|$|The site is now {{a grassy}} meadow and has become an {{important}} area for wildlife. Birds such as the <b>Eastern</b> <b>meadowlark,</b> bobolink, and various sparrows now inhabit the area. This has caused the site to become popular with local birders.

40|$|We {{compared}} {{an index}} of reproductive success based on breeding behavior to actual nest fates of grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) and <b>eastern</b> <b>meadowlarks</b> (Sturnella magna) on 12 plots (4 -ha). Concordance of results between the two methods was 58 % for grasshopper sparrows and 42 % for <b>eastern</b> <b>meadowlarks</b> on a plot-by-plot basis. The indirect method yielded higher estimates of reproductive activity than nest monitoring for {{the balance of the}} plots,. There was little evidence that brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) parasitism influenced the estimates of reproductive success using the indirect method. We concluded that nests and about-to-fledge nestlings were missed during searches on some plots. It may be appropriate to use an indirect method to more efficiently survey territories and/or plots for species with hard-to-find nests or when monitoring large areas. Use of a reproductive index may be appropriate and more time-efficient than nest searching and monitoring for comparing management effects such as burning, grazing, haying, military training, and other localized disturbances that are likely to affect reproductive success of grasshopper sparrows and <b>eastern</b> <b>meadowlarks.</b> However, nest monitoring may be necessary for more precise estimates of productivity necessary for long-term monitoring. Nest monitoring results are also likely to allow for direct comparisons to results from other studies because the index method requires intimate knowledge of the species being evaluated - a factor that could lead to reduced precision because the experience level of technicians relying only on behavioral cues from study-to-study is likely to vary considerably...|$|R
50|$|In North America, alvars provide {{habitat for}} birds such as bobolinks, <b>eastern</b> <b>meadowlarks,</b> upland sandpipers, <b>eastern</b> towhees, brown thrashers and loggerhead shrikes whose habitat is declining elsewhere.

5000|$|As a group, the meadowlarks {{have had}} a {{volatile}} taxonomic history. When Carl Linnaeus described the <b>eastern</b> <b>meadowlark</b> (the first of the meadowlarks to be scientifically described) in his epic 10th edition of Systema Naturae in 1758, {{he thought it was}} related to the Old World larks, and so put it in the genus Alauda with them. In the same work, he put the red-breasted blackbird in the bunting genus Emberiza. Less than a decade later, he described the <b>eastern</b> <b>meadowlark</b> again, this time putting it into the starling genus Sturnus, which Juan Ignacio Molina also used when he first described the long-tailed meadowlark in 1782. In 1816, Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot created the genus Sturnella, moving the meadowlarks into his new taxon. Most taxonomists accepted the new genus, and the western meadowlark, Peruvian meadowlark and Lilian's meadowlark were all placed in this taxon when they were later described. When Charles Lucien Bonaparte described the white-browed blackbird and pampas meadowlark, however, he assigned them to another newly created genus — Trupialis, for what he called [...] "ground-starlings"; he moved the red-breasted blackbird into that now-defunct genus as well.|$|E

5000|$|Described as [...] "one of {{the most}} cold-tolerant snakes", on warmer winter days, it often comes out of {{hibernation}} to bask in the sun. It is most active between April and late October depending on location. Mating normally takes place in April or May and birth takes place between August and October. Courtship usually occurs near the communal hibernation site, and polygynous mating systems have been observed. The snake's typical diet consists of earthworms, slugs, and small amphibians, including the larvae of salamanders. It has also been observed eating small mammals and birds, such as bank swallows and <b>eastern</b> <b>meadowlarks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, the meadowlarks were split again.

40|$|Declining {{grassland}} {{breeding bird}} populations {{have led to}} increased efforts to assess habitat quality, typically by estimating density or relative abundance. Because some grassland habitats may function as ecological traps, a more appropriate metric for determining quality may be breeding success. Between 1994 and 2003 we gathered data on the nest fates of <b>Eastern</b> <b>Meadowlarks</b> (Sturnella magna), Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorous), and Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis) {{in a series of}} fallow fields and pastures/hayfields in western New York State. We calculated daily survival probabilities using the Mayfield method, and used the logistic-exposure method to model effects of predictor variables on nest success. Nest survival probabilities were 0. 464 for <b>Eastern</b> <b>Meadowlarks</b> (n = 26), 0. 483 for Bobolinks (n = 91), and 0. 585 for Savannah Sparrows (n = 152). Fledge dates for first clutches ranged between 14 June and 23 July. Only one obligate grassland bird nest was parasitized by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater), for an overall brood parasitism rate of 0. 004. Logistic-exposure models indicated that daily nest survival probabilities were higher in pastures/hayfields than in fallow fields. Our results, and those from other studies in the Northeast, suggest that properly managed cool season grassland habitats in the region may not act as ecological traps, and that obligate grassland birds in the region may have greater nest survival probabilities, and lower rates of Brown-headed Cowbird parasitism, than {{in many parts of the}} Midwest...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} abundance of grassland birds was estimated on an 81 -ha (200 -acre) dry to dry-mesic sand prairie in south, west Wisconsin over an 18 -year period (1987 - 2004). Birds were surveyed three {{times during the}} breeding season on seven, 2 -ha (5 -acre) strip transects in six different burn units. We compared results to time since fire and other habitat features. The average rotation of prescribed fires in the burn units ranged from three to six years. Seven species were selected for detailed analysis. These were grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum),- 18 -year average of 1. 33 birds per ha, field sparrows (Spizella pusilla) at 0. 64 birds/ha, <b>eastern</b> <b>meadowlarks</b> (Stumella magna) at 0. 54 birds/ha, lark sparrows (Chondestes grammicus) at 0. 50 birds/ha, mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) at 0. 18 birds/ha, dickcissels (Spiza americana) at 0. 17 birds/ha, and vesper sparrows (Poocetes gramineus) at 0. 07 birds/ha. Observed bird densities by burn year indicated the year of burning to be unique {{in relation to other}} years in the burn cycle. Mourning doves and vesper and lark sparrows were detected in greater densities in the year of a burn compared to the years pre- or post- burn. In contrast, grasshopper sparrows, <b>eastern</b> <b>meadowlarks,</b> field sparrows, and dickcissels were observed at lower densities during the year of a burn than in the pre- or post-burn years, but they were never eliminated. For some species, such as lark, field and vesper sparrows, the removal of woody vegetation {{during the early years of}} the study period may have affected abundance. With the exception of vesper sparrows, overall management actions at Spring Green Preserve, including the prescribed burning regimen, appear to allow its grass land bird populations to be maintained...|$|R
40|$|Cattle-grazing is a {{dominant}} land {{use in the}} United States, with more than 300 million hectares of land grazed each year. The habitat changes facilitated by cattle grazing can influence resource availability and habitat selection for associated wildlife. To investigate the potential for changes in traditional livestock management to restore native grassland and riparian habitat, we evaluated biological community responses to winter-grazing and livestock exclusion at the Kansas Army Ammunition Plant in southeastern Kansas. In grassland habitats, we combined winter-grazing by domestic cattle and discontinued fertilization {{in an attempt to}} restore pastures dominated by tall fescue to native tallgrass prairie and improve habitat for grassland-breeding birds. We observed a decrease in tall fescue and an increase in native, warm-season grasses in winter-grazed pastures compared to fertilized, year-round grazed pastures. Grassland-breeding bird responses to winter-grazing were species-specific. Dickcissels preferred winter-grazed pastures, while <b>Eastern</b> <b>Meadowlarks</b> and Grasshopper Sparrows tended to prefer year-round grazed pastures.
