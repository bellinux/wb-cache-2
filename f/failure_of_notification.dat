40|$|National audienceRegisters of the {{management}} of infarction can complement information obtained from randomised trials evaluating the methods and practice of treatment. In order to do this, {{the quality of the}} registers must be assured, and in particular the accuracy of the recorded cases. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the accuracy of a register for the in-hospital and pre-hospital management of acute coronary syndromes with ST segment elevation of less than 12 hours' duration. Using a capture-recapture method, the study compared cases in the register with eligible cases present in the hospital and emergency ambulance service databases at two establishments, giving a recruitment rate of 61 %. The rate of accuracy was estimated at 84 % (95 % CI [82; 86]). The independent factors associated with <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> were female sex (ORa= 6. 65 [2. 04 - 21. 69]), presentation at nights, weekends or bank holidays (ORa= 4. 13 [1. 33 - 12. 85]), direct admission to hospital without passing by the emergency ambulance service (ORa= 2. 85 [1. 03 - 7. 69]), primary angioplasty (ORa= 6. 18 [1. 60 - 23. 79]) and the absence of reperfusion (ORa= 40. 38 [6. 21 - 262. 40]). With more than 80 % accuracy, the results produced by the register are robust. The selection bias linked to the under-representation of certain subgroups, while real, has only a marginal impact on estimates derived from the register. Factors associated with <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> should be taken into account when operating such a register...|$|E
30|$|The survey {{questioned}} whether UK gynaecologists felt patients {{should now be}} informed of adhesion risks. While {{the majority of respondents}} agreed this should occur for all gynaecological procedures, over one in five disagreed. The majority also recognised that surgeons have a duty of care to protect patients by providing the best possible standards of care—including taking steps to reduce adhesions. The established duty of care requires that the clinician must give advice and sufficient information upon which a patient can reach a rational decision as to whether they accept or refuse treatment. In the consent process, it is recommended that patients should be advised of the reasons for and nature of the procedure, the benefits, risks, discomforts and alternatives and the consequences of not undergoing the procedure. Importantly, in the UK, the National Health Service Litigation Authority (NHSLA) has identified a risk level of 1 – 2 % as being the limit above which <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> could be deemed to be negligent [27]. It is common practice in the consent process to advise patients of risks of complications such as general anaesthesia and general complications after laparoscopic surgery, (e.g. pain, bleeding, infection, damage to the bowel–bladder–urethra), but their risk ratios are less [28] than those for a directly adhesion-related re-admission (adhesiolysis) in the first year after open or laparoscopic gynaecological surgery [16].|$|E
40|$|Abstract Tuberculosis (TB) is a {{notifiable}} {{disease by}} the Communicable Disease Control Law in Taiwan. Several {{measures have been}} undertaken to improve reporting of TB but the completeness and timeliness of TB notification in Taiwan {{has not yet been}} systemically evaluated. Methods To assess completeness and timeliness of TB notification, potential TB cases diagnosed by health care facilities in the year 2005 - 2007 were identified using the reimbursement database of national health insurance (NHI), which has 99 % population coverage in Taiwan. Potential TB patients required notification were defined as those who have TB-related ICD- 9 codes (010 - 018) in the NHI reimbursement database in 2005 - 2007, who were not diagnosed with TB in previous year, and who have been prescribed with 2 or more types of anti-TB drugs. Each potential TB case was matched to the national TB registry maintained at Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) by using national identity number or, if non-citizen, passport number to determine whether the patients had been notified to local public health authorities and Taiwan CDC. The difference in the number of days between date of anti-tuberculosis treatment and date of notification was calculated to determine the timeliness of TB reporting. Results Of the 57, 405 TB patients who were prescribed with 2 or more anti-tuberculosis drugs, 55, 291 (96. 3 %) were notified to National TB Registry and 2, 114 (3. 7 %) were not. Of the 55, 291 notified cases, 45, 250 (81. 8 %) were notified within 7 days of anti-tuberculosis treatment (timely reporting) and 10, 041 (18. 2 %) after 7 days (delayed reporting). Factors significantly associated with <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> are younger age, previously notified cases, foreigner, those who visited clinics and those who visited health care facilities only once or twice in 6 months. Conclusion A small proportion of TB cases were not notified and a substantial proportion of notified TB cases had delayed reporting, findings with implication for strengthening surveillance of tuberculosis in Taiwan. Countries where the completeness and timeliness of TB notification has not yet been evaluated should take similar action to strengthen surveillance of TB. </p...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> <b>of</b> tuberculosis in the City of Birmingham {{during the}} three-year period 1960 - 62 {{related to the}} population data from the Census of 1961 showed important differences between the <b>notification</b> rates <b>of</b> groups defined by their place of birth, and also differences in the age distributions <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> rates between these groups (Springett, 1964).

40|$|A {{field study}} in ten homes was {{conducted}} to understand what influences users’ acceptability <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in the home environment. The key finding is that perceived message urgency is the primary indicator <b>of</b> acceptability <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in the home—if people think a message is urgent, they want the message to be shown immediately, regardless {{of what they are}} doing at the time <b>of</b> <b>notification.</b> The study also shows that the acceptability of low-urgent and medium-urgent messages could be improved by taking into account mental activity load at the time <b>of</b> <b>notification.</b> No effect <b>of</b> physical activity was found on acceptability. The results suggest that to improve the scheduling <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in the home, notification systems need a mechanism assessing both the message urgency and the mental activity load, whereas physical activity can be ignored. From a methodological point of view, it is difficult to measure acceptability <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in a realistic setting, given the need to balance experimental control with realistic context. The present paper suggests a way to introduce controlled notifications and subjective measurements of acceptability in homes. Industrial DesignIndustrial Design Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Event Notification {{service system}} is a data {{dissemination}} technology which asynchronously notifies consumers whose interests match with the events published by producers. Fault-tolerance is important for a large-scale event notification service system as link or node failures usually occur in a wide-area network. In this paper, we first describe architecture <b>of</b> event <b>notification</b> service system for large scale network to minimize the size of routing entities and to reduce latency <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> delivery to consumers. We then present a replication algorithm based on primary-back replication so that event notification service system is resilient to <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> event servers and links between them and maintains dissemination of events. The replication technique used in proposed architecture can minimize {{the portion of the}} system affected by these failures. 1...|$|R

40|$|Background The {{globalization}} of food supply necessitates continued advances in regulatory control measures {{to ensure that}} citizens enjoy safe and adequate nutrition. The {{aim of this study}} was to extend previous reports on network analysis relating to food notifications by including an optional filter by type <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> and in cases of contamination, by type of contaminant in the notified foodstuff. Methodology/Principal Findings A filter function has been applied to enable processing <b>of</b> selected <b>notifications</b> by contaminant or type <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> to i) capture complexity, ii) analyze trends, and iii) identify patterns of reporting activities between countries. The program rapidly assesses nations' roles as transgressor and/or detector for each category of contaminant and for the key class of border rejection.

40|$|The {{focus of}} my {{dissertation}} research {{is on the}} examination <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> systems that harness different presentation formats for notification delivery, the preferences that individuals express for these various types <b>of</b> <b>notifications,</b> and how these preferences are affected by contextual information surrounding notification delivery. My research is unique from other work in the literature in two primary ways. First, {{while the majority of}} prior work addressing notification delivery, both in terms of format and timing, has focused on the effects <b>of</b> a <b>notification</b> on an individual’s performance on a given task or set of tasks, my focus is the individual’s perception <b>of</b> <b>notifications,</b> and particularly on that individual’s preferences for different notification formats delivered within different contextual scenarios. An interest in this question is motivated by prior studies that have shown that annoyance with computer-human interactions is a primary reason behind user abandonment of interactive software systems. Second, my preliminary findings suggest that different people prefer different types <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in different contexts, which motivates a change of focus in the development of such systems toward customizing notifications not only to the features of an individual’s context but also to the individual him- or herself. An additional element of novelty in my work is that my final study was conducted in a purely naturalistic office environment, in which the notifications evaluated were precisely those notifications being delivered to study participants throughout their workday. The primary contribution of this dissertation is twofold: a detailed analysis of the methodology for the design, data collection, and analysis of a study <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> preferences in a naturalistic setting {{with a great deal of}} inherent complexity; and a set of results, based on the analysis of preference data acquired in various settings, about how an individual’s contextual environment, and the content <b>of</b> a given <b>notification,</b> can affect that individual’s preferences for notification delivery...|$|R
