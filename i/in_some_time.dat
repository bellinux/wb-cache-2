5|$|According to a U.S. official, in 2004 a {{prisoner}} named Hassan Ghul revealed that bin Laden {{relied on a}} trusted courier known as al-Kuwaiti. Ghul stated that al-Kuwaiti was close to bin Laden as well as Khalid Sheik Mohammed and Mohammed's successor Abu Faraj al-Libbi. Ghul revealed that al-Kuwaiti had not been seen <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>time,</b> which led U.S. officials to suspect he was traveling with bin Laden. When confronted with Ghul's account, Mohammed maintained his original story. Abu Faraj al-Libbi was captured in 2005 and transferred to Guantánamo in September 2006. He told CIA interrogators that bin Laden's courier was a man named Maulawi Abd al-Khaliq Jan and denied knowing al-Kuwaiti. Because both Mohammed and al-Libbi had minimized al-Kuwaiti's importance, officials speculated that {{he was part of}} bin Laden's inner circle.|$|E

25|$|For most of {{the time}} since it joined CBS, KTVT {{has been one of the}} network's weaker {{stations}} in terms of total day and local news viewership. However, it has made gains in viewership <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> periods since the late 2000s, even beating overall first place stalwart WFAA <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> periods. During the February 2011 sweeps period, the station's 6:00 and 10:00p.m. newscasts placed first among total viewers for the first time in the station's history. That May, KTVT had placed second overall in both total viewership and in the demographic of adults ages 25–54 by small margins for the first time in its history; this is in comparison to the May sweeps period of the previous year, in which Channel 11 won in both total viewers and 25- to 54-year-olds. The 5:00, 6:00 and 10:00p.m. newscasts all saw ratings increases in both demographics placing second.|$|E

Everyone presumes Ryan is dead. However, Zach discovers him alive. When Ryan strongly reasons with Zach not to reveal to Greenlee or Kendall, or anyone that he is still alive, Zach agrees, feeling that Ryan's temper is dangerous to Greenlee. He also sees Ryan's need to start fresh, just as he once had.|$|E

After losing his wife, he uses his new abilities by cheating customers out of money for his [...] "ghost hunting" [...] business. However, a mass murderer comes back from Hell, prompting Frank to investigate the supernatural presence. Fox's performance received critical praise, Kenneth Turan in The Los Angeles Times wrote; [...] "The film's actors are equally pleasing.

500|$|Doc Kuhn is {{possibly}} the greatest ball {{player on the}} squad, due to his miraculous fielding around short this season. Starting with the opening college games he went for six straight games without an error, finally putting Tot McCullough off the bag with a wide heave that broke the run. The Michigan and Ohio coaches were loud in their praises for Kuhn {{as one of the}} greatest fielding shortstops they had seen <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>time.</b> His hitting this season has been hard and timely, including a homer, four triples, and three doubles. He hits in streaks, however, and this alone will keep the phenomenal Vandy star out of a major berth in the near future. Kuhn, Embry and McCullough stand out head and shoulders above anybody in their respective lines that has visited here in recent years.|$|E

[...] Writing after the campaign, he explained that he did not feel he could effectively support Lord Rawdon, who he had left in command in South Carolina, and that he would be unable to gain control of North Carolina until Virginia had been pacified. [...] Since he had not received instructions from Clinton <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>time,</b> he wrote the general a letter specifically requesting direction: [...] "I am very anxious to receive your Excellency's commands, being as yet totally in the dark as to the intended operations of the summer.

500|$|Yeezus {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 84, based on 46 reviews. In The Guardian, lead critic Alexis Petridis found it [...] "noisy, gripping, maddening, potent", while Helen Brown from The Daily Telegraph {{said it was}} [...] "the most exciting album" [...] she had heard <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>time.</b> Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone called it a [...] "brilliant, obsessive-compulsive career auto-correct" [...] that made other abrasive records by [...] "mad geniuses", such as In Utero by Nirvana and Radiohead's Kid A, seem tame by comparison. Pitchfork critic Ryan Dombal viewed it as a [...] "razor-sharpened take" [...] on West's fourth album, 808s & Heartbreak, concluding that [...] "cohesion and bold intent are at a premium on Yeezus, {{perhaps more than any}} other Kanye album. Each fluorescent strike of noise, incongruous tempo flip, and warped vocal is bolted into its right place across the album's fast 40 minutes." [...] Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times felt it was his most ambitious piece of music yet, and Evan Rytlewski from The A.V. Club said it was his most uninhibited record: [...] "Even by the standards of an artist who reinvents himself with each release, it's a drastic departure".|$|E
500|$|Rhythm Killers {{was well}} {{received}} by contemporary critics. In a review for The Philadelphia Inquirer, Ken Tucker remarked that having mastered reggae, Sly and Robbie proved they could perform funk music just as well. Steve Hochman from the Los Angeles Times hailed {{it as one}} of 1987's best records from any genre because of how Sly and Robbie drew on the funk's past 20 years, [...] "from Sly & the Family Stone through George Clinton, along the way throwing in reggae, rap and even a bit of Rossini." [...] In Rolling Stone, Gavin Edwards called it [...] "a thirty-five-minute dance party full of surprises and strange noises", writing that it [...] "sounds like the Great Missing DJ Set—albeit one played by live musicians with perfect telepathy." [...] i-D magazine's Simon Witter said it was the most entertaining and exceptionally conceived dance album of the year, while Stereo Review called it one of the best dance records <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> because the duo's creative yet accessible urban dance music showed how to combine the best parts of older music with contemporary recording techniques. In a negative review, Greg Taylor from The Sydney Morning Herald criticized the music as [...] "wallpaper" [...] undermined by a gaudy hip hop production. John Leland of Spin wrote that while Rhythm Killers may be ambitious and successful as a [...] "dialogue on the crosscultural elasticity of the funk", it lacked vigor as actual funk music and never got beyond its concept and [...] "into the funk". In The New York Times, Palmer found the musical ideas innovative and its concept [...] "a worthy one"—that [...] "funk is the [...] of contemporary dance music"—but he observed an excess of disordered effects and funk-derived sounds on what were otherwise expressive rhythm tracks.|$|E

Common law traditionally considers an accessory just as guilty as the principal(s) in a crime, and subject to the same penalties. Separate and lesser punishments exist by statute in many jurisdictions.|$|R
