At this point the discs are clear and contain all the digital information desired; however they cannot be played because there is no reflective layer.|$|E

This Best Practice presents a spreadsheet {{that can be used to}} help a community to make the “ship or process”decision [...] Best Practice: The economic model below is based on the actual costs of a community glass processing system established in 1997. The system was manufactured by Andela Tool and Machine of Richfield Springs, New York. The community’s recycled glass collections totaled about 1000 tons per year, which means that the 5 -ton per hour processing system operates only one day per week. This processing system consists of an infeed hopper, <b>infeed</b> <b>conveyor,</b> two-stage pulverizer, outfeed conveyor, and twostage trommel separator. The pulverizer is an impact mill with a series of hinged hammers attached to shafts. The system generates two grades: 1 / 8 x 3 / 8 ” and 1 / 8 ” and finer. The coarse output is being used as drainage aggregate and the finer is being used in on-site wastewater treatment systems. Assumptions Available tons of glass per year: 1000 The crusher average speed (high conservative) : 5 tons per hour Days of operation per year: 5...|$|E
