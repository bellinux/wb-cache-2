40|$|Published {{population}} rosters {{can serve}} as a convenient source of population controls. The authors evaluated one such roster, the Massachusetts Resident Lists, by estimating the completeness of the Lists and by describing the differences between persons included and not included on the Lists. The subjects were cases from three case-control studies of ovarian cancer conducted in eastern Massachusetts between 1978 and 1996. For each of the three case series, more than 90 % of the cases were located on the Resident Lists. Age was one of the primary differences to emerge between cases included and not included; in the most recent case series, cases younger than age 40 years were less likely than older cases to be included on the Lists.

The 20-mule team symbol was first used in 1891 and registered in 1894. In 1988, just over 20 years after the acquisition of U.S. Borax by Rio Tinto Group, the Boraxo, Borateem and 20-Mule Team product lines were sold to <b>Dial</b> Corporation by <b>U.S.</b> Borax.|$|R
5000|$|Packard Bell radios had {{a unique}} styling {{that makes them}} easy to identify. Being a US West Coast radio maker, they {{maintained}} that image by [...] "stationizing" [...] their radio <b>dials.</b> Major <b>US</b> West Coast and Canadian (west of the Rocky Mountain range) radio station call letters were printed on the tuning dial. From 1926 through 1950, the marketing area for Packard Bell radios consisted of the states of Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Many Packard Bell models made during this period have stationized dials with the call letters of the major stations from these states marked in their proper places on the dial. These [...] "stationized" [...] dials also include KSL 1160 in Salt Lake City and KOA 850 in Denver. This was an idea inspired by Herb's mother who had trouble reading the tuning dial. After 1950, Packard Bell discontinued its [...] "stationized" [...] dials when it began selling radios and televisions throughout North America.|$|R

However, most areas not within an overlay plan can still use 7-digit dialing for local calls, although long distance calls within the area code may have required ten or eleven digits. Eleven digits for toll calls became standard in all of North America {{by the end of}} 1994 to allow introduction of [...] "interchangeable NPA codes" [...] - area codes that did not have a 0 or 1 as the middle digit and could therefore be confused with the central office code - after January 1, 1995.|$|R

The sales of Dial bath soap, for instance, shot up after Aunor endorsed it. Originally imported from the <b>US,</b> <b>Dial</b> soap first catered the AB bracket. When it was eventually manufactured locally, it courted the CD market by making Aunor its product endorser. Aunor appeared in a television commercial of Dial soap taking a shower and singing, [...] "Arenâ€™t you glad you used Dial?". The television commercial proved successful as sales of Dial soap went up, and the masses, which comprise the bulk of her fans, patronized Dial soap.|$|R

Grentz coached the U.S. World University Games team in Toronto in 1989 before heading the 1990 U.S. World Championships team in Malaysia and the U.S. Goodwill Games team in Seattle. Both of her 1990 national teams won {{gold medals in}} their respective tournaments. In 1990, Grentz was the head coach for the USA National team at the World Championships in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The team, behind the 22 point per game scoring of Teresa Edwards, won all eight contests, with only the win over Cuba decided by single digits. The USA team faced Yugoslavia in the gold medal game, and won 88-78.|$|R

Since early 199 systematic measurements of zone concentration profiles from approximately 18 to 35 km altitude are performed. Our measurements are carried out in 5 hours in average during the night and in cloudless conditions. The <b>DIAL</b> system allows <b>us</b> to calculate directly the ozone profile from the lidar backscattering radiation since it is a self- calibrating technique.

The temperature data is obtained from the radiosondes measurements performed at Ezeira International Airport. The evolution of the stratospheric ozone profile is studied for different months.

40|$|This {{document}} was originally {{conceived as a}} description of the radium studies that took place at Argonne National Laboratory. It soon became evident, however, that to document the widespread use of radium, a brief review of the application of radium in medicine and in the <b>US</b> <b>dial</b> painting industry is required. Further, because the Argonne studies were not the only such efforts, brief overviews of the other radium programs are included. Even so, much material has been omitted. The extensive references included will allow the interested reader to find additional information. The effects of internally deposited radium in humans have been studied in this country for more than 75 years. Some 2, 400 subjects have had their body contents of radium measured, and a majority of them have been followed for most of their adult lives, to understand and quantify the effects of radium. Many more individuals acquired radium internally but were never measured. Some of this group have been located and followed until death; in these cases the cause of death is known without a body content measurement. As a consequence of the efforts made to locate, measure, and follow exposed individuals, {{a great deal of information}} about the effects of radium is available. Nevertheless, great gaps remain in the knowledge of radium toxicity. The Argonne study is the largest every undertaken of the effects on humans of an internally deposited radioelement, in which the insult has been quantitated by actual measurements of the retained radioisotope. The study has now been terminated, even though more than 1, 000 subjects with measured radium burdens are still alive. This document is written as a brief summary of current knowledge accumulated in this incomplete study...|$|R
