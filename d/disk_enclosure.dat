HDDs require a certain range of air densities in order to operate properly. The {{connection}} to the external environment and density occurs through a small hole in the enclosure (about 0.5mm in breadth), usually with a filter on the inside (the breather filter).

Breather holes can be seen on all disk drives – they usually have a sticker next to them, warning the user not to cover the holes. The air inside the operating drive is constantly moving too, being swept in motion by friction with the spinning platters. This air passes through an internal recirculation (or [...] "recirc") filter to remove any leftover contaminants from manufacture, any particles or chemicals that may have somehow entered the enclosure, and any particles or outgassing generated internally in normal operation. Very high humidity present for extended periods of time can corrode the heads and platters.|$|E

A {{computer}} disk drive's {{motor speed}} varies slightly but irregularly, principally because of air turbulence inside the <b>disk's</b> <b>enclosure.</b> The unpredictability of turbulence is well-understood mathematically; it reduces not to computational complexity, but to information losses.

This paper has three parts: a mathematical argument tracing our RNG's randomness to a formal de nition of turbulence's unpredictability, anovel {{use of the}} FFT as an unbiasing algorithm, and a check &quot; data analysis. ...|$|R

50|$|Patented in 1994, the Clariion {{disk array}} had some {{interesting}} features that later became {{standard in the}} data-storage and computing industry.

50|$|Some {{advanced}} {{hard disk}} drive commands, such as Tagged Command Queuing and Native Command Queuing (which may increase performance), ATA Secure Erase (which allows all data on the drive to be securely erased) and S.M.A.R.T. (accessing indicators of drive reliability) exist as extensions to low-level drive command sets such as SCSI, ATA and ATAPI. These features may not work when the drives are placed in a <b>disk</b> <b>enclosure</b> that supports a USB mass-storage interface. Some USB mass-storage interfaces are generic, providing basic read-write commands; although that works well for basic data transfers with devices containing hard drives, there is no simple way to send advanced, device-specific commands to such USB mass-storage devices (though, devices may create their own communication protocols over a standard USB control interface). The USB Attached SCSI (UAS) protocol, introduced in USB 3.0, fixes several of these issues, including command queuing, command pipes for hardware requiring them, and power management.|$|E

5000|$|Aster {{computers}} {{was based}} {{in the small town}} of Arkel near the town of Gorinchem.Initially Aster computer b.v. was called MCP (Music print Computer Product), because it was specialized in producing computer assisted printing of sheet music. The director of the company was interested in Microprocessor technology and noticed there was a market for selling kits to computer building amateurs, so they started selling electronic kits to hobbyists, and employed four persons at that time [...] They also assembled kits for people without soldering skills, especially the [...] "junior Computer" [...] from Elektor (a copy of the KIM-1), and the ZX80 from Sinclair. Among the kits sold there were also alternative floppy disk drives for TRS-80 computers. But these needed the infamous TRS-80 expansion interface, which was very expensive, and had a very unreliable floppy disk controller because it used the WD1771 floppy disc controller chip without an external [...] "data separator". To fix this problem MCP developed a small plugin board which could be plugged into the socket for the WD1771, and which contained a data separator, and a socket for the WD1791 to support dual-density operation. Still, the expansion interface was expensive and due to its design it was also unreliable. So they decided to also develop their own alternative in the form of an improved floppy disk controller and printer interface that could be built right into a floppy <b>disk</b> <b>enclosure.</b> The lack of RAM expansion offered by this solution was solved by a service in which the 16 KB RAM chips inside the base unit would be replaced by 64 KB RAM chips.While this went on MCP renamed itself to MCP CHIP but ran into problems with the German computer magazine CHIP, and had to return to its former name. At that time MCP did also sell imported home computers like the TRS-80, the Video Genie, (another TRS-80 clone), the Luxor ABC 80 and the Apple II.They also sold the exotic Olivetti M20, a very early 16-bit personal computer that was one of the very few systems to use a Z8000 CPU.|$|E

5000|$|SCSI {{attached}} enclosure {{services is}} a computer protocol used mainly with <b>disk</b> storage <b>enclosures.</b> It allows a host computer {{to communicate with the}} enclosure to access its power, cooling, and other non-data characteristics.
