5|$|Boas Munyonga {{represented}} Zambia in men's judo. He qualified {{by being}} awarded an additional {{place in the}} additional places category for the African continent by the International Judo Federation. He participated in the men's middleweight class, which includes athletes under 90 kilograms in weight. Munyonga was Zambia's oldest athlete at the London Olympic Games, at age 31, and was taking part in his first Olympic Games. He {{said that he would}} do his best in the event. Munyonga faced Takahiro Nakai of Japan on 31 July in the round of 32. When the ball rang to signal the start of the match, Munyonga held Nakai by the leg and placed him onto the corners of the mat. The primary umpire signalled the boxers to face each other and disqualified Munyonga and declared Nakai the match's winner. Munyonga stated that he regretted the move and that he <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>about</b> a rule which stated the leg was not allowed to be held by another competitor.|$|E
5|$|Dick Rubin {{handled the}} film's props, {{and set up}} a {{makeshift}} office in the corner of stage 9 throughout production. Rubin's philosophy as property master was that nearly every actor or extra ought to have something in their hands. As such, Rubin devised and fabricated about 350 props for the film, 55 of which were used in the San Francisco tram scene alone. Many of the props were updated designs of items previously seen in the television series, such as phasers and handheld communicators. The only prop that remained from the original television series was Uhura's wireless earpiece, which Nichols specifically requested {{on the first day of}} shooting (and all the production crew save those who had worked on the television show <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>about).</b> The new phaser was entirely self-contained, with its own circuitry, batteries, and four blinking lights. The prop came with a hefty $4000 price tag; to save money, the lights were dropped, reducing the size of the phaser by a third. A total of 15 of the devices were made for the film. The communicators were radically altered, as by the 1970s the micro-miniaturization of electronics convinced Roddenberry that the bulky handheld devices of the television series were no longer believable. A wrist-based design was decided upon, with the provision that it look far different from the watch Dick Tracy had been using for decades previous. Two hundred communicators were fashioned, but only a few were the $3500 top models, used for close-ups of the device in action. Most of the props were made from plastic, as Rubin thought that in the future man-made materials would be used almost exclusively.|$|E
25|$|However, when Madoka {{appeared}} to retrieve Homura, she <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>about</b> her duty as the Law of Cycles and her powers, thus Kyubey kept observing her until that point. Having recovered her memories, Homura forces herself {{to complete the}} witch transformation {{at the cost of}} having her soul destroyed, to protect Madoka from the Incubators. At that moment Sayaka and a new girl named Nagisa Momoe, whose witch form is actually Charlotte—the witch that killed Mami—lead Madoka and the others in breaking the barrier to reach Homura's real body. Madoka recovers her memories and power as the Law of Cycles and reaches for Homura, but the latter releases the curse in her Soul Gem which she reveals is not one of despair, but love. With this power, retaining her human form, Homura suppresses Madoka's powers while transcending into what she considers to be a demon.|$|E

25|$|The {{story of}} Caritoux's {{victory in the}} 1984 Vuelta a España is quite {{extraordinary}} in that he won a Grand Tour as a second year professional which is quite unusual. However, even more unusual is that, one week before the start, neither Caritoux or his team had any intention of actually riding the race. At that time the Vuelta started {{in the second half}} of April and the Skil manager Jean de Gribaldy had made a promise at the start of the year to the Vuelta organisers that his team would be on the start line. A promise he <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>about</b> but the organisers had not, de Gribaldy was threatened with a £50,000 fine if the team did not ride, he had to scrape together a squad for the Vuelta at the last minute, this included the holidaying Caritoux, who was told to get to Geneva and then fly to Jerez de la Frontera in the south of Spain where the Vuelta was starting.|$|E
500|$|In September 1975 Harrison told BBC Radio 1's Paul Gambaccini {{that it was}} [...] "such a good backing track" [...] originally, yet he <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>about</b> its {{existence}} until coming across the tape years later. In a 1987 interview, Harrison acknowledged the difficulty he had in singing the song in so high a key; [...] "it was recorded in Ronnie's register," [...] he explains in his 1980 autobiography, [...] "a bit high for me." [...] Although Ronnie Spector's name did {{not appear in the}} album credits, snippets of her 1971 guide vocal remain on Harrison's released recording. Spector's voice can be heard intermittently from the two-minute mark onwards, with her signature [...] "woh oh-oh oh-oh"s audible during the song's playout.|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{considered}} {{that a great}} part of the episode's merits were due to George R. R. Martin's script. Sepinwall felt that [...] "Martin didn't get the easiest draw when he wound up having to dramatize the events depicted in 'The Pointy End,'" [...] but still loved the results. Mo Ryan concluded that anyone who was doubting whether Martin <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>about</b> writing television scripts should now put their doubts to rest. The [...] "expert" [...] review from the A.V. Club by Todd VanDerWerff noted [...] "a definite sense of Martin's hand at work here. Characters that have never quite worked onscreen—like Sansa—suddenly feel much more alive. Characters that have been working—like Tyrion and Arya—get lots of fun stuff to play that never once feels labored." ...|$|E

500|$|The Economist {{reported}} in early October that Syria had disclosed 19 chemical weapons-related sites, whilst unnamed Western intelligence sources believed 45 sites {{to exist in}} total. One U.S. official {{said it was not}} clear if the discrepancy is [...] "a deception" [...] or merely a [...] "difference of definition" [...] regarding what constitutes a chemical weapons site. In Science Insider, experts stated that there was a possibility of incomplete record-keeping, citing an incident in 2002 wherein Albania discovered, in a cluster of mountain bunkers, 16 tons of primitive, undocumented chemical weapon agents that Albania <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>about.</b> Chemical weapons expert Winfield has commented that the success of the destruction plan depends on Syria revealing all of its chemical arms stockpile, much of which is moveable and may be spread across dozens of sites.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{attempted}} arrest of the graffiti man, Harwood swung a coat at a protester, pulled a BBC camera{{man to the}} ground, used a palm strike against one man, and at 7:19 pm pushed another man to the ground for allegedly threatening a police dog handler. It was seconds after this that he saw Tomlinson standing {{with his hands in}} his pockets beside a bicycle rack, being told by police to move away. Harwood told the inquest he made a [...] "split-second decision" [...] that there was justification for engagement, then struck Tomlinson on the thigh with his baton and pushed him to the ground. He said it was a [...] "very poor push" [...] and he had been shocked when Tomlinson fell. Harwood made no mention of the incident in his notebook; he told the inquest he <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>about</b> it.|$|E

Four years later during Carey's Angels Advocate Tour in 2010, {{she had not}} performed the song on the first few runs of the tour. At the show in Phoenix, she told the crowd that she had forgotten the song until that night: [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>about</b> this song the whole tour and I don't know why. Funny I should forget it, considering the title." [...] Dressed in a [...] "form-fitting short dress with a flared, tutu-like bottom" [...] for the first portion of the night, Carey completed the song as the fourth on the set-list.|$|E

500|$|In the {{south-east}} Lonsdale Force's Major Cain {{armed with}} a PIAT anti-tank projectile engaged {{in a fight with}} German armoured vehicles for which he would be awarded the Victoria Cross. Elsewhere around the brigade's positions the Germans mounted a number of small attacks, at times supported by armour. Shortage of ammunition made the defenders hold fire until the Germans got within [...] The tactic was successful and time after time the Germans were beaten back. In between German infantry attacks, the defenders came under almost constant mortar and artillery bombardment, which was responsible for the destruction of the divisional ammunition dump. At one stage Major Powell of 156 Para discovered that he and his men were surrounded when the British units on either side of them pulled back without informing them. Asking for permission to withdraw, he gained the impression that headquarters <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>about</b> them or thought they had been wiped out. The gaps in the perimeter did allow individual German snipers to infiltrate brigade positions and the Glider Pilots had to send out dedicated anti-sniper patrols to hunt them down. Patrols from both sides moved around the brigade's area and anyone caught in the open during daylight was liable to be confronted by the other side and shot. Touring his brigade positions, Brigadier Hackett, Lieutenant-Colonel Thompson of the artillery and the Brigade Major Tiny Maddon, were caught in the open by mortar fire. Maddon was killed outright while Hackett and Thompson were both wounded and taken to the house of Mrs Kate ter Horst for treatment.|$|E
500|$|For {{the timing}} of {{introducing}} the new characters, the showrunners decided to introduce the Punisher immediately and hold back on Elektra briefly, with Ramirez explaining that [...] "one of the pitfalls when we have this many great characters to play with is wanting to throw them at the wall", but {{it was important to}} take the time to introduce the new characters properly to the audience, particularly to the people who weren't already familiar with them. Elaborating on the aim to keep the story focused on Murdock, Petrie revealed that the writers would often come up with [...] "amazing stuff" [...] for the season, but then realize that they <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>about</b> Murdock and had to [...] "completely turn it over and look at how this affects Matt and filter it through that prism." [...] Ramirez added,It could easily become The Punisher story or the Elektra story that Matt cameos in, and not vice versa. So, we built it like a Matt story, in terms of what we wanted to put him through, where we wanted to get him, by the end of the season, and what we wanted to have him learn about himself, and we used an Elektra and Frank story throughout, to get him there... we talked about when we watch shows in 13 episode stretches, how do we watch them? What is an exciting structure that we would like to think about here? Do we divide it right down the middle? Do we do a three-act structure?...If you were to sit and watch 13 episodes, you would absolutely feel a structure, much like in the comics. That’s what we did this season.|$|E

2500|$|The Residents, at this time, {{were at a}} rough {{point in}} their career. According to {{official}} Residents lore, there was internal turmoil {{which resulted in a}} large, [...] "embarrassing" [...] food fight; they decided to resolve this tension in 1974 by recording what would later become Not Available – representative of N. Senada's Theory of Obscurity taken to its logical conclusion. The album was recorded and then placed in storage in order to be issued only when everyone <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>about</b> it. However, contractual obligations related to the much-delayed release of Eskimo forced its release in 1978 after the band had almost forgotten about it. The Residents were not bothered by this deviation from their plan since the 1978 decision to release the album would not affect the philosophical conditions under which it was originally recorded.|$|E
2500|$|On the July 9 {{episode of}} Raw Is War, Kane was {{scheduled}} to face Mike Awesome and Lance Storm in a handicap match.

As the move was being applied, however, Rob Van Dam and Tommy Dreamer ran through the audience and into the ring and started to beat on Kane and Jericho. In response, WWF wrestlers consisting of The Dudley Boyz, Tazz, Justin Credible, Rhyno, and Raven (all former ECW wrestlers) ran to the ring. After a brief stand-off, the WWF cavalry turned around and attacked Kane and Jericho. This prompted Paul Heyman to leave the announce table and enter the ring. After high-fiving the wrestlers, he announced that ECW has been brought into the Invasion. Heyman talked about how tired he was sitting beside Jim Ross and discussing WCW vs. WWF, stating that he felt that everyone <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>about</b> ECW and announced, [...] "This Invasion just got taken to the extreme!".|$|E
2500|$|With [...] "Somethings Weird," [...] Eisenstein played Wildrick {{the song}} and [...] "we got right to work". Wildrick felt the song [...] "represents an {{awakening}} within a relationship". According to Collier, [...] "Punishment" [...] was [...] "a [...] song, and I feel he always writes sad tunes." [...] Hrycenko found [...] "Not the First a challenge" [...] to [...] "get good enough with all the transitions that I felt confident tracking". He called it [...] "pretty heavy, and the little roll on the ride in the bridge is super tight". According to Eisenstein, the group used to call [...] "Headstone" [...] the [...] "H20 Song" [...] as they considered it [...] "super manly, fast and punk". Eisenstein composed the guitar riff in a hotel in Arizona, and wrote the lyrics {{in the back of}} the group's van. The group <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>about</b> [...] "Spunn" [...] until Jimmy Dunn, a friend of the band, reminded them about it. Dunn had a copy of Eisenstein's demo of the song, which he dug out for the group. According to Hrycenko [...] "Picture Perfect" [...] went through 10 different names because of the lyric about a car. Wildrick claimed that [...] "Night Feelings" [...] bridge shows that Bruzzese and Eisenstein are fans of 311. According to Collier, people who heard the album's final track, [...] "Atlas," [...] called it [...] "a wild card of a song for this album". He felt the song did not have the same vibe as the rest of the songs on the album.|$|E
