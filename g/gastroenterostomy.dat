5000|$|A <b>gastroenterostomy</b> is the {{surgical}} {{creation of a}} connection between the stomach and the jejunum.

Berg was chief of the gastrointestinal service there between 1915 and 1934, when he retired from active service, becoming a consulting surgeon. At the behest of his colleague Richard Lewisohn, Berg performed the first subtotal gastric resection for peptic ulcer in the United States. Berg was [...] "a strong advocate of the procedure and reported more than 500 cases, in which a recurrence rate of slightly over 1% was compared to a recurrence rate of 34% after <b>gastroenterostomy</b> alone". Berg [...] "gained nationwide renown as an innovator {{in the field of}} abdominal surgery".

50|$|Infantile hypertrophic pyloric {{stenosis}} {{was first}} fully described by Harald Hirschsprung in 1888. Initially surgeons {{were reluctant to}} advise surgical intervention in these cases, even though mortality from the condition was high, as the mortality rate from surgery was also very high. Pyloric dilatation and pyloroplasty were tried with little success. Some surgeons found better results with <b>gastroenterostomy</b> to bypass the obstructed pylorus. On 23 August 1911 Ramstedt operated on the first case of pyloric stenosis he had seen. He had decided to perform a pyloroplasty, which involved incising the pyloric muscle longitudinally and then closing the defect by suturing the muscle back together transversely. He performed the longitudinal incision, relieving the obstruction, but found that the sutures tore out through the muscle when he attempted to close the incision. He elected to cover the defect with an omental patch, realising {{that it was not}} necessary to suture the pyloric muscle. This procedure, incising the pyloric muscle while leaving the mucosa intact and leaving the muscle to heal, was the first pyloromyotomy to be performed and became known as Ramstedt's operation. Ramstedt performed a second pyloromyotomy in 1912, and did not use an omental patch on the second occasion. Both children recovered well, and Ramstedt reported the new procedure in September 1912.|$|E
50|$|William Osler Abbott {{received}} his A.B. in 1925 and M.D. in 1928 from the University of Pennsylvania. After graduating {{he worked as}} an intern in a Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. From 1931 to 1934 he had experience working part-time with the Department of Pharmacology, and he also co-founded the Miller Abbott Tube in 1934, which is a double lumen drainage intestinal tube for relief of distention. His partner was T. Grier Miller {{who worked with him}} from 1930 to 1934 when they founded the Miller Abbott Tube. In the midst of being part-time with the Department of Pharmacology, Abbott was working his way up the ladder at Penn. He Joined the Gastro Intestinal clinic at Penn and was first recognized as a Medical fellow from 1930 to 1931. From 1931 to 1937 he was known as an instructor at Penn. In the year 1937, Abbott worked with a man named Arthur Joy Rawson creating the Abbott Rawson Tube, which is a double barreled <b>Gastroenterostomy</b> tube for use in postoperative care. From an instructor he was now named associate from the year 1937 to 1941. Abbott was known as a professor of medicine at Penn, however the following year he brought his expertise to the U.S. Army. When Abbott joined the U.S. Army he was already the rank of a major. Shortly, being discharged due to his diagnosis of leukemia. After fabricating his double lumen tube, Abbott would initially swallow the tube in the morning at his home on the Main Line outside of Philadelphia, ride to work on the train with the proximal end exiting his nose and curled around his ear or leaving his mouth beside a pipe and residing in a coat pocket. Once in the hospital the intubation continued under fluoroscopic guidance. With the fundamentals of a practical technique of intubation established, he began his investigations of the absorptive capacity of the gut and the effect of drugs on the intestine in December 1932. On May 15, 1942 Abbott, a major in the Medical Corps, left Philadelphia with the 20th General Hospital for Camp Claiborne, Louisiana. Eight days later while undergoing a physical examination a large spleen was detected and blood studies led to a diagnosis of Myelogenous leukemia. Abbott's remaining months of life were spent researching his cancerous disease.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} nine {{patients who}} had severe, persistent abdominal pain, vomiting, dumping, or diarrhoea several years after truncal vagotomy and <b>gastroenterostomy</b> had been performed for duodenal ulceration. Each patient was judged to have a bad clinical result (Visick grade 4). There {{was no evidence of}} recurrent ulceration in any of the patients, and in each the patency of the pyloric canal was confirmed radiologically or endoscopically. Each patient was treated by simply dismantling the <b>gastroenterostomy</b> without addition for a pyloroplasty. In one patient the surgeon suspected that a vagal trunk might have been left intact, and a revagotomy was performed by the "highly selective" technique. Postoperatively, none of the patients developed gastric retention. Symptomatic improvement occurred in eight patients, and four of them achieved perfect results (Visick grade 1). Side effects are common after vagotomy and <b>gastroenterostomy,</b> and are largely attributable to the presence of the <b>gastroenterostomy</b> stoma. Our results show that the symptoms may be alleviated by closing the <b>gastroenterostomy,</b> without precipitating gastric retention...|$|E
40|$|Because {{a number}} of options are {{available}} to relieve the obstructed bile duct, stomach or both in patients with irresectable carcinoma of the pancreatic head, palliative surgery for this condition was reviewed retrospectively between 1971 and 1981 at the Royal United Hospital, Bath. One hundred and sixty-five patients underwent a biliary bypass procedure with (n = 37), or without (n = 128) gastric drainage. Thirty patients had a prophylactic <b>gastroenterostomy</b> to avoid gastric outlet obstruction: tumour encroachment made <b>gastroenterostomy</b> essential in seven others. After biliary bypass alone, operative mortality was 14 %. After a concomitant <b>gastroenterostomy,</b> mortality was 27 % (P less than 0. 04). Within a year of biliary bypass alone, there was a 9 % incidence of gastric outlet obstruction requiring gastric drainage, with an associated mortality rate of 18 %. Survival after biliary bypass or biliary bypass with <b>gastroenterostomy</b> was equal (7 - 8 months). Except where gastric outlet obstruction is imminent, palliation for irresectable pancreatic head carcinomas should be by biliary bypass alone, because {{the addition of a}} <b>gastroenterostomy</b> almost doubles the mortality without any advantage in survival time...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{feasibility}} of laparoscopic gastroenteric and cholecystenteric bypass procedures for palliation of inoperable cancer of the pancreas.

The increased complications were due to 16 episodes of bleeding among the irradiated patients. Rates of obstructive complications were similar for both groups (20 %). Rates of bleeding were highest among patients undergoing prophylactic GE and irradiation compared to those receiving GE alone. Vagotomy in 12 patients who were irradiated did not appear to protect against bleeding. We found the irradiated prophylactic GE to provide poor palliation in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer and recommend it not be performed if radiotherapy is to be used for attempt in local control of unresectable pancreatic cancer...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The authors {{report the}} final results of a {{prospective}} single-center randomized study whose aim was to compare the endoscopic placement of self-expandable stents with open surgical <b>gastroenterostomy</b> to relieve gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) in patients with advanced antropyloric adenocarcinoma. A systematic review of the medical literature from December 1999 to December 2011 was carried out to determine the results of endoscopic stenting in patients with GOO from unresectable primary cancer of the antropyloric region. METHODS: In the prospective study, 18 patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the antropyloric region and symptoms of GOO were enrolled. In 9 patients, self-expandable stents were placed, and in 9 patients, open surgical <b>gastroenterostomy</b> was performed. Patients were followed until death. Six hundred seventy-two patients with primary unresectable cancer of the antropyloric region and GOO syndrome who underwent endoscopic stenting were identified from the literature. RESULTS: In the prospective study of 18 patients, there was no case of postprocedural mortality. Efficient gastric emptying resumed more quickly in patients who received stents, although 3 months after the procedures, {{there was no difference}} between the 2 groups. Mean crude survival was 258 days in patients who received stents and 283 days in those who underwent surgical <b>gastroenterostomy</b> (P = NS). In patients who underwent stent placement, there were 2 cases of stent migration and 2 cases of food impaction, which were resolved with endoscopy at a mean follow-up of 70 days. In the 672 patients from the literature, operative mortality and morbidity were very low. In prospective studies, complications related to stents were more common than previously thought. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic placement of metallic stents offers an effective therapy in patients with advanced primary adenocarcinoma of the antropyloric region and poor general condition. In patients with longer life expectancies, the form of therapy should be chosen individually, considering that surgical <b>gastroenterostomy</b> has fewer complications in the medium term and that in patients with endoscopic stenting, very careful follow-up is required, with the possibility of new operative endoscopy in half of the patients.

40|$|During {{the past}} 40 years, after <b>gastroenterostomy</b> and pyloroplasty for {{duodenal}} ulcer {{had been replaced}} by partial gastrectomy in many centres, partial gastrectomy itself gave way to combinations of vagotomy with <b>gastroenterostomy,</b> pyloroplasty or antrectomy. Opinions differ concerning the procedure of choice and in this paper the author examines the causes of this diversity of opinion and assesses the reliability of conclusions that can be drawn about the elective treatment of duodenal ulcer today. Most reports of results from various operations have come from retrospective studies, and the causes of variability among such reports are analyzed to point out the great difficulty in making a valid judgment about the relative worth of the various operations used to treat duodenal ulcer. Results of some of the few prospective studies with randomized operations assessed blindly are then presented and note is taken of the surprising observation that greatly different operations appear to give remarkably similar results. From the data available the author develops a logical way of approaching the choice of operation for the various problems related to duodenal ulcer that require elective surgical treatment...|$|E
