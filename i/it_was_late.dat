5|$|Delayed by {{the late}} arrival of the York garrison, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> evening before the Royalists were fully deployed. A flurry of rain showers and the discouragement of Newcastle and Eythin persuaded Rupert to delay his attack until the next day. From {{the ranks of the}} allied army he could hear the singing of psalms. As the Royalist troops broke ranks for their supper, Leven noted the lack of {{preparation}} among his opponents and ordered his men to attack at or shortly after 7:30pm, just as a thunderstorm broke out over the moor.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> on 1 August {{when the}} British fleet {{appeared}} in the bay, and the French were at anchor in a strong defensive position. The French commander, Vice-Admiral François-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers, did not expect a night attack, but Nelson ordered his ships to form up and attack {{the head of the}} French van, taking advantage of a favourable wind which allowed his ships to drift down the line, while preventing the French rear from reinforcing the van and centre. Bellerophon was the eighth ship in the British line, and as the battle began, Darby turned her towards the French centre, eventually coming to anchor at 7 pm. Possibly due to some error {{on the part of the}} crew or because the anchor had dragged, Bellerophon came to rest alongside the French flagship, the 120-gun Orient.|$|E
5|$|Michael J. Fox was {{the first}} choice to play Marty McFly, but he was {{committed}} to the show Family Ties. Family Ties producer Gary David Goldberg felt that Fox was essential to the show's success. With co-star Meredith Baxter on maternity leave, he refused to allow Fox time off {{to work on a}} film. Back to the Future was originally scheduled for a May 1985 release and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> 1984 when it was learned that Fox would be unable to star in the film. Zemeckis' next two choices were C. Thomas Howell and Eric Stoltz. Stoltz impressed the producers enough with his earlier portrayal of Roy L. Dennis in Mask (which had yet to be released) that they selected him to play Marty McFly. Because of the difficult casting process, the start date was pushed back twice.|$|E

5|$|In late 1899, MacLaren {{joined a}} private cricket tour of America and Canada {{organised}} by the cricket-playing Indian prince Ranjitsinhji. The following March, {{he was appointed}} as an assistant secretary at Lancashire. The position was a sinecure; his main role was to coach the first eleven which effectively meant that he was paid to play cricket, despite his amateur status. Surviving records do not indicate his salary, but some sources suggest he was paid comfortably more than Lancashire's leading professionals. In addition, MacLaren worked as a journalist for the Daily Express, reporting on matches in which he played, a common practice at the time for amateurs. Resuming sole control over the Lancashire side, and freed from his teaching responsibilities, MacLaren played {{from the beginning of}} the 1900 season, planning meticulously in a bid to lead Lancashire to the County Championship. His batting form suffered initially, but the team dominated the start of the season. Commentators gave much of the credit to MacLaren's captaincy. However, he was severely criticised for conservative tactics in one game, when he was reluctant to attempt to force a win. In the latter stages of the season, MacLaren scored prolifically, making a succession of high scores at rapid pace. He ended the 1900 season with 1,554 runs at 36.13. During that season, the leading Lancashire bowler Arthur Mold had been no-balled for throwing, but MacLaren defended him in the press. At a meeting of county captains in December, MacLaren was the only representative to defend the legality of Mold's bowling action, and in 1901, Mold was again no-balled and his career was effectively over. MacLaren struggled with injury in 1901, and his batting form suffered. He frequently dropped low in the batting order, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> in the season before he began to score runs regularly. His captaincy was criticised after some tactical decisions which were either unconventional or unsuccessful, and he clashed with the Lancashire committee over the poor state of Old Trafford's pitch. In total, he scored 1,069 first-class runs at 31.44.|$|E

25|$|On 28 November {{he faced}} a court martial on board Gladiator at Portsmouth. The charge {{was that he}} had failed to follow orders to proceed to Quebec to bring home a convoy. He argued that the reason he had not sailed was that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> in the year and that the weather was bad. The court {{accepted}} his reasoning and acquitted him.|$|E
25|$|On March 13, 1865, the Confederate Congress passed General Order 14 by {{a single}} vote in the Confederate senate, and Jefferson Davis signed the order into law. The order was issued March 23, but as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> in the war, only a few African American {{companies}} were raised in the Richmond area before the town was captured by the U.S. Army and placed back under U.S. control.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> in the 11th {{century that}} a single {{anonymous}} scholar appears to have brought together these and numerous other poems and fitted them into an elaborate prose framework – partly of his own composition and partly drawn from older, no longer extant sources (i.e. the tochomlaidh referred to above by O'Curry), paraphrasing and enlarging the verse. The result was the earliest version of LGE. It was written in Middle Irish, a form of Irish Gaelic used between 900 and 1200.|$|E

Right after the battle, the Toungoo command {{received}} intelligence that the Arakanese army led by Min Aung Hla, Viceroy of Sandoway (Thandwe), was crossing the Arakan Yoma range at the Padaung Pass, and that a sizable Arakanese navy led by Crown Prince Min Dikkha was sailing past Cape Negrais. They had expected a land invasion but the size of the Arakanese naval force caught them by surprise. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> April 1542.|$|E
25|$|When the Second Boer War {{broke out}} in South Africa in October 1899, a Liberal MP, Leonard Courtney, invited Hobhouse to become {{secretary}} of the women's branch of the South African Conciliation Committee, {{of which he was}} president.

Early production models had some teething troubles in service, as ground crew learned to service and adjust the new gears, and pilots to operate them. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> in 1917 before {{a version of the}} gear that could operate twin guns became available, so that the first Sopwith Camels had to be fitted with the Sopwith-Kauper gear instead.|$|E

25|$|Clarke and Warne put on 100 runs {{between them}} in the {{afternoon}} session, with Clarke making a century. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> in the afternoon before England finally made some inroads, with Matthew Hoggard striking {{either side of the}} tea interval. Shane Warne was out leg before wicket just prior to the break. Michael Clarke was caught by Ashley Giles after tea, having made 124 runs, and with the score at 505 for 8. Hoggard and James Anderson took a wicket each to clean up the tail within eight overs, so that Australia were all out for 513 runs from 165.3 overs.|$|E
25|$|On May 15, 2007, NetBank {{received}} a warning from the Nasdaq stock market because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> in filing {{its most recent}} quarterly report. NetBank {{received a}} similar notice from Nasdaq in March 2007 {{because it did not}} file its 2006 annual report on time. The report was delayed because the company needed to find a new independent auditor following the resignation of Ernst & Young LLP in November 2006. NetBank hired Porter Keadle Moore LLP as its new independent auditor in February 2007. NetBank said it planned to file the annual and quarterly reports by the end of June 2007.|$|E
25|$|Being Toyota's first {{recruitment}} of a top driver and Grand Prix winner, Jarno Trulli's move from Renault was big news. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> during the 2004 season, and Trulli was dropped from Renault's race line-up despite matching his team-mate Fernando Alonso, {{and replaced by}} Jacques Villeneuve. Soon after, Toyota F1 revealed that Trulli would race for them during the 2005 season and beyond. However, Olivier Panis retired from racing before the year was out, leaving a space in Toyota's race attack, meaning Trulli was promoted earlier than anticipated. Qualifying 6th on his Toyota debut in Japan {{was the start of}} a competitive run for the team. No points were scored that year, although Trulli comfortably outpaced his team-mate Ricardo Zonta.|$|E

25|$|By {{capturing}} Ratchaburi, the Burmese had now fought {{their way}} out of the narrow isthmus, and made it to the mainland Siam. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> March 1760 (early Tagu 1121 ME). As the invasion army approached Ayutthaya, the Siamese forces, which already suffered heavy losses in men, guns and ammunition, made another stand at Suphanburi, immediately to west of the capital. The defenses consisted of over 33,000 men (including 3000 cavalry), and their mission was to stop the Burmese from crossing the river that separates Ayutthaya from Suphanburi. The Burmese launched a three pronged attack (led by Hsinbyushin in the center flanked by generals Minkhaung Nawrahta and Minhla Thiri) on heavily fortified Siamese positions. The Burmese took heavy losses but ultimately prevailed, taking five senior Siamese commanders and their war elephants.|$|E
25|$|On Friday 19 April 1991, Marriott and Poulton flew {{home from}} the United States, where Marriott had {{recorded}} songs for a future album with Frampton. During the flight, according to Poulton, Marriott was drinking heavily, was in a foul mood, and the two argued constantly. After arriving in the UK, a mutual friend met them and they all {{went to one of}} Marriott's favourite restaurants, The Straw Hat in the village of Sawbridgeworth for dinner, where he consumed more alcohol. After dinner, they returned to their friend's house and decided to stay overnight, since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>late,</b> but upstairs in bed, Marriott and Poulton continued to argue. Poulton finally fell asleep and later woke to discover that Marriott had taken a taxi to his home in the nearby village of Arkesden.|$|E
25|$|The Sultan, {{upon hearing}} of the debacle, {{dispatched}} three armies to Albania. Skanderbeg, upon learning of the sultan's plans, immediately marched into Macedonia. A large force under Hasan bey set out to march into Albania through the same pass as Sinan a month before, unaware that Skanderbeg was ready to meet him. While the Ottomans were idle, Skanderbeg ordered the enemy guards to be killed and a full-scale battle soon ensued. Most of the Ottoman soldiers were killed and Hasan himself was wounded by an arrow piercing through his right arm. Despite {{the fact that most}} of his army was annihilated and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> at night, he took some of his most loyal soldiers up into a more secure place. Skanderbeg came to understand this the next morning and immediately set off to find him. Out of desperation, Hasan came out unarmed and surrendered to Skanderbeg asking for mercy. Skanderbeg gave Hasan what he was asking for and the latter was taken prisoner.|$|E
