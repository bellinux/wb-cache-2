50|$|This article {{assumes that}} the {{rotation}} is also stable, such that no torque is required to keep it going. The kinematics and dynamics <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> around a fixed axis of a rigid body are mathematically much simpler than those for <b>free</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> a rigid body; they are entirely analogous to those of linear motion along a single fixed direction, which is not true for <b>free</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> a rigid body. The expressions for the kinetic energy of the object, and for the forces on {{the parts of the}} object, are also simpler for rotation around a fixed axis, than for general rotational motion. For these reasons, rotation around a fixed axis is typically taught in introductory physics courses after students have mastered linear motion; the full generality of rotational motion is not usually taught in introductory physics classes.|$|R

50|$|Aggregation-induced {{emission}} (AIE) is {{an abnormal}} phenomenon that is observed with certain organic luminophores.Most organic compounds have planar structures and higher photoemission efficiencies in solution {{than in the}} solid state. However, some organic luminophores have freely-rotating groups that consume energy and promote radiation-less decay after they are excited in solution. When these luminophores aggregate or crystallize and the <b>free</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> those groups is restricted in the solid-state, the photoluminescence efficiency (i.e. quantum yield) becomes {{higher than in the}} solution phase.|$|R
30|$|After {{determining}} the equilibrium positions, {{we can find}} the spring constants and then solve the eigenvalue problem to find the normal modes. Note that due to rotational symmetry, there always is a zero frequency planar mode corresponding to the <b>free</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> the crystal. In an actual experiment, however, we expect that the rotational symmetry of the trap will be broken by stray fields, the radial optical access tunnels, imperfections in the electrodes, etc., so that mode will be lifted from zero.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{iron complex}} of 3, 7 -diethyl- 2, 8 -dimethylporphyrin was {{incorporated}} into horse heart apomyoglobin to investigate the influence of peripheral substitution on artificial heme rotation. The hyperfine-shifted (1) H NMR spectrum of the reconstituted deoxymyoglobin (rMb) revealed the proximal imidazole N-H resonance at 82. 5 ppm to indicate {{the formation of the}} FeN (His 93) bond. The pyrrole-protons of the hemin of myoglobin in the absence of external ligand appeared as four resonances between - 10 and - 18 ppm, indicating a mainly low-spin ferric hemin, with a ligated distal histidine (His 64). This also indicates the lost of the symmetry of the hemin, according to an absence <b>of</b> <b>free</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> the prosthetic group. The (1) H NMR spectrum of reconstituted rMbCO revealed a set of four pyrrole-protons and a set of four meso-protons. Accordingly, the prosthetic group without acid side chains interacts specifically with the surrounding globin showing a unique heme orientation in the (1) H NMR time-scale, despite the presence of only four alkyl substituents on the porphine ring.
