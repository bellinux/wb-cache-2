An expected photocurrent for the device displaying a <b>kink</b> in <b>the</b> J-V response is determined by fitting to a power law. The difference between the expected and measured photocurrent allows for the determination of a voltage drop within the device.

40|$|In this note, we {{relate the}} two {{well-known}} difficulties of Godunov schemes: the carbuncle phenomena in simulating high Mach number flow, and the inaccurate pressure profile in simulating low Mach number flow. We introduced two simple low-Mach-number modifications for the classical Roe flux {{to decrease the}} difference between the acoustic and advection contributions of the numerical dissipation. While the first modification increases the local numerical dissipation, the second decreases it. The numerical tests on the double-Mach reflection problem show that both modifications <b>eliminate</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinked</b> Mach stem suffered by the original flux. These results suggest that, other than insufficient numerical dissipation near the shock front, the carbuncle phenomena is strongly relevant to the non-comparable acoustic and advection contributions of the numerical dissipation produced by Godunov schemes due to the low Mach number effect.

40|$|We {{present a}} study based on pulsed {{measurement}} results of <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> effect observed on the I-V output characteristics in InGaAs/InAlAs/InP pseudomorphic high-electron mobility transistors (InP pHEMTs) at cryogenic temperatures. Pulsed measurements were performed at 300 and $ 10 $ K. Gate and drain lags were observed at both temperatures {{with a strong}} increase upon cooling for the drain lag. To study the influence of surface traps in <b>the</b> <b>kink,</b> pulsed measurements of devices passivated by either atomic layer deposited Al²O³ or plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposited Si³N⁴ were compared with no significant differences at 10 K. The influence on <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> effect from <b>the</b> buffer was studied by comparing pulsed measurement data from an InP pHEMT with measurements on a GaAs metamorphic HEMT (GaAs mHEMT). For the GaAs mHEMT, an increase of the drain lag at 10 K was observed {{when compared with the}} InP pHEMT. Contrary to the InP HEMT, for the GaAs mHEMT the 0. 1 μs pulses were short enough to <b>eliminate</b> <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> when using a quiescent point with VDS = 0.

50|$|In {{the case}} of a class B/AB amplifier, {{crossover}} distortion can be reduced by using a slight forward bias in the base circuit such that the transistors are idling at a small output current. The forward bias causes the circuit to operate in class-AB mode, so both transistors are slightly on during crossover. This can reduce or <b>eliminate</b> <b>the</b> characteristic <b>kink</b> of crossover distortion, although other types of crossover distortion will remain.|$|R
50|$|However, <b>the</b> tetrode <b>kink</b> limits <b>the</b> {{permissible}} {{variation of}} anode voltage, and restricts {{the use of}} screen-grid valves to small-signal applications. The suppressor grid of <b>the</b> pentode <b>eliminates</b> <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> in <b>the</b> anode characteristic by preventing secondary electrons, which originate in the anode, from reaching the screen grid, and thus permits a wider excursion of anode voltage, as is required for power amplification. The same effect can be produced {{in the case of}} a tetrode by introducing two modifications. Firstly, the wires of the screen grid are aligned with those of the control grid so that the former lie in the electron 'shadow' created by the latter. This reduces the screen grid current, thereby giving greater efficiency, and also concentrates the electrons into dense beams in the space between the screen grid and the anode. The intense negative space charge of these beams prevents secondary electrons from the anode from reaching the screen grid, thus <b>eliminated</b> <b>the</b> tetrode <b>kink.</b> Secondly, in small valves whose electrode structure is supported in the conventional way with vertical wire rods and mica spacers, it was found to be necessary to introduce sheet-metal beam-forming electrodes between the screen grid and the anode. The purpose of these beam-plates is to constrain the electron beams into parts of the electrode system which are sections of a cylinder. (See sectional view, right). Successful creation of the electron beam between screen grid and anode required for a kinkless anode characteristic depends on the details of the geometry of the electrode structure of the beam tetrode. In the cases where the electrodes have complete cylindrical symmetry, a kinkless characteristic can be achieved without the need for beam-plates, alignment of the screen grid wires with those of the control grid being sufficient. This form of construction is usually adopted in the larger tubes with an anode power rating of 100W or more. The Eimac 4CX250B (rated at 250W anode dissipation) is an example of this class of beam tetrode. Note that a radically different approach is taken to the design of the support system for the electrodes in these types (see illustration). The 4CX250B is described by its manufacturer as a 'radial beam tetrode', drawing attention to the symmetry of its electrode system.|$|R
5000|$|An {{alternative}} approach to <b>the</b> problem of <b>eliminating</b> <b>the</b> tetrode <b>kink</b> {{was introduced by}} Hivac in 1935. It was found by J.H Owen Harries that if {{the separation of the}} anode from the screen grid were varied, a critical separation could be found (about 3 cm) where <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> in <b>the</b> tetrode's anode characteristic disappeared, and the amplification of the valve became particularly distortion-free. Both fidelity and efficiency exceeded those of the available pentodes of the time. A range of tetrodes of this type were introduced, aimed at the domestic receiver market, some having 2V directly heated filaments, intended for low-power battery-operated sets, others with 4V or higher, indirectly heated cathodes for mains operation. Output powers ranged from 0.5W to 11.5W [...] Confusingly, several of these new valves bore the same type number as existing pentodes with almost identical characteristics. Examples include Y220 (0.5W, 2V filament), AC/Y (3W, 4V heater), AC/Q (11.5W, 4V heater), etc.|$|R

40|$|Abstract We study {{radiation}} and energy balance for an antiplane fault containing a kink. A semi-infinite crack {{with a sharp}} rupture front propagates along the flat portion of a kinked crack. At time t 0, the crack reaches <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> located at <b>the</b> origin of coordinates and continues propagating beyond <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> at a different speed. We com-pute the exact solution for this problem using a Chaplygin transformation, {{a variation of the}} well-known Cagniard–de Hoop method. We first establish an integral equation for the computation of stress intensity factor after <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> and then we solve numeri-cally for the velocity and stress field around the crack. We find that the propagation of the crack across <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> produces a sharp change in energy balance that in turn pro-duces a circular SH wave centered at <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> that we call <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> wave. Across <b>the</b> wavefront of this wave there is a sudden jump in particle velocity and radial stress. At the same time, a local stress concentration appears on the external side of <b>the</b> <b>kink.</b> We establish an exact energy balance for this problem in terms of energy rates per unit crack advance. Radiated energy is shown to maintain the balance between elastic en-ergy released by the bulk and energy used to make the crack advance. <b>The</b> <b>kink</b> wave-front is <b>the</b> boundary between a field dominated by the initial flat portion of the crack and a region dominated by radiation from <b>the</b> <b>kink...</b>|$|R

40|$|In rock material, {{the smooth}} crack mostly becomes kinked crack during its growth {{due to the}} {{anisotropy}} of rock material. For <b>the</b> <b>kinked</b> crack, <b>the</b> outer normal direction of the crack surface at <b>the</b> <b>kinked</b> line is not unique, so the continuous element is not feasible to discrete the crack surface near <b>the</b> <b>kinked</b> line. Therefore four types of new discontinuous element are employed for <b>the</b> <b>kinked</b> crack. A dual boundary element method (DBEM) based on the method suited for the smooth crack problem is proposed to deal with <b>the</b> <b>kinked</b> crack problem. <b>The</b> numerical verification shows that the results calculated with the present method are in very good agreement with those with the primary method for the smooth crack problem. Furthermore, the proposed method is used to analyze <b>the</b> <b>kinked</b> crack in transversely isotropic rock material of infinite domain. The stress intensity factor (SIF) is obtained. The rectangular smooth crack in transversely isotropic rock material bends. The crack opening of both crack surfaces at two sides of <b>the</b> <b>kinked</b> line has mutual inhibiting effect due to the crack surface subjected to uniformly-distributed normal load. The dip angle between the crack surface and the isotropy plane changes as the crack surface bends gradually. It is found that the fracture behavior of <b>the</b> <b>kinked</b> crack is also affected by the anisotropy of the rock material. 巖體材料的各向異性導致其中的光滑裂紋在擴展后會變為折線裂紋。對于折線裂紋,其折線處裂紋面外法線方向不惟一,不能用連續單元離散。為此,在光滑裂紋問題方法的基礎上,引入 4 種新的不連續單元來離散折線處裂紋面,建立了適用于折線裂紋問題的對偶邊界元方法,該方法基于橫觀各向同性基本解。算例驗證表明,該方法具有較好的精度。最后用該方法分析了橫觀各向同性巖體中的折線裂紋,得到了該類裂紋的應力強度因子。當裂紋面上作用法向均布力,橫觀各向同性巖體介質中的矩形光滑裂紋發生彎折時,折線兩側的裂紋面在張開時存在抑制效應,從而導致折線裂紋裂尖應力強度因子小于原光滑裂紋。同時還發現,隨裂紋面的逐漸彎折,其裂紋面對各向同性面的傾角發生變化,因此,其裂尖斷裂特性還受到巖體各向異性的影響...|$|R
