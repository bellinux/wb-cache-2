In quadrature intermediate frequency (IF) receivers, <b>image</b> <b>aliasing</b> due to in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) channel mismatches is always a big problem. I/Q mismatches occur because of gain and phase imbalances between quadrature mixers and capacitor mismatches in analog-to-digital converters (ADC). As a result, the dynamic range and performance of a receiver are severely degraded. In this paper, several popular receiver architectures are summarized and the <b>image</b> <b>aliasing</b> problem is investigated in detail. Based on this analysis, a low-IF architecture is proposed for a single-chip solution and a novel and feasible anti-image algorithm is investigated. With this anti-image digital processing, the image reject ratio (IRR) can reach approximately above 50 dB, which relaxes image rejection specific in front-end circuit designs and allows cheap and highly flexible analog front-end solutions. Simulation and experimental data show that the anti-image algorithm can work effectively, robustly, and steadily...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Blind {{separation}} of permuted <b>alias</b> <b>image</b> {{was a new}} type of single channel blind separation, which was fundamentally different from traditional single channel blind separation in theory and method. In this paper, a blind separation algorithm based on four-phase-difference and differential evolution was proposed for a type of permuted <b>alias</b> <b>image</b> with blur difference. The model of permuted <b>alias</b> <b>image</b> was briefly introduced. Space domain was selected as characteristic domain after analyzing various detection methods of blur characteristic. First, four-phase-difference versions of permuted <b>alias</b> <b>image</b> are computed and the fitness function was first evaluated by calculating sum of square errors of binary version and its version with a threshold vector. The differential evolution was then performed to obtain the optimal threshold vector for threshold the differential image into binary one. The permuting image could be separated by permuted <b>alias</b> <b>image</b> multiplied with the binary image. Experimental results showed that the proposed approach could effectively separate the permuting image from the permuted <b>alias</b> <b>image</b> without respect to the location, size, number and blurry types of the permuting image.

40|$|In {{functional}} MRI, {{each slice}} in a volume is traditionally excited individually, measuring enough {{data in a}} single k-space array to reconstruct an image for that slice. However, simultaneously exciting multiple slices {{that make up a}} volume can produce sufficient data in a single k-space array to represent multiple slices.

A statistical description of an image representing two aliased slices using a single channel coil is presented. Image separation, utilizing calibration reference scans of each slice, through both an existing magnitude-only approach and a new complex-valued approach are described, and the statistical properties of these two image separation approaches are presented. Through examining the expected mean image and covariance matrix of the separated images, it is theoretically shown that correlations remain between images of slices through both approaches.

40|$|<b>Image</b> <b>Aliasing</b> is {{a problem}} {{appearing}} as artifacts in digitally resampled images, which degrades {{the quality of the}} image. In digital rectification and texture mapping pixels from an input image are transformed to pixels of an output image. Discrete nature of a digital image causes Aliasing in transformed image. In this paper source of aliasing and theory of antialiasing is described. The necessity of a precise filter design in antialiasing is discussed and a filter based on Kaiser adjustable window is designed. Different practical antialiasing methods are described as well as interpolation methods, which are conventional in photogrammetry. Selected antialiasing methods are implemented and applied on a close range image. An objective analysis is carried out by applying the inverse transforms to rectified images and deriving some measures to estimate the information loss for each method by comparing original and reconstructed images. Results indicate that interpolation methods are not capable of removing or reducing Aliasing in highly decimating transformations. The output images of interpolation methods therefore suffer from edge corruption and interfusion of small features. Applying kaiser filter with a precise AntiAliasing method results in the least information loss and considerably reduces aliasing at the expense of higher computation load...|$|E

Differencing techniques and area comparisons establish irregularity exceeding set limits. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Preferred Features: The data extraction and smoothing unit includes a band pass filter. The lower frequency is selected to suppress curvature, the upper frequency is selected to smooth higher frequencies, without removing the irregularity of interest. A development includes two low pass filters and a subtracter. A non-linear filter is used for smoothing. Pixel artifacts are excluded (aliasing); singularities are excluded. The unit making comparative judgments is a two-dimensional median filter avoiding suppression of regions exceeding the predetermined area limit. Practical implementation includes a laser (13) and cylindrical lens (12) producing a flat beam (11) to light the surface. A matrix camera (14) measures the diffusely-reflected flat beam. Bulges, or neckings of the sidewalls are registered, rejecting hash from tread edges and shoulders. A controller relates camera framing frequency and tire speed, to obtain a given resolution. USE - To detect e. g. bulges and depressions in tire sidewalls, for quality inspection and control.

40|$|Imaging {{speed is}} an {{important}} issue in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as subject motion during image acquisition is liable to produce artifacts in the image. However, the speed at which data can be collected in conventional MRI is fundamentally limited by physical and physiological constraints. Parallel MRI is a technique that utilizes multiple receiver coils to increase the imaging speed beyond previous limits by reducing the amount of acquired data without degrading the image quality. In order to remove the <b>image</b> <b>aliasing</b> due to k-space undersampling, parallel MRI reconstructions invert the encoding matrix that describes the net effect of the magnetic field gradient encoding and the coil sensitivity profiles. The accuracy, stability, and efficiency of a matrix inversion strategy largely dictate the quality of the reconstructed image. This thesis addresses five specific issues pertaining to this linear inverse problem with practical solutions to improve clinical and research applications. First, for reconstruction algorithms adopting a k-space interpolation approach to the linear inverse problem, two methods are introduced that automatically select the optimal k-space subset samples participating in the synthesis of a missing datum, guaranteeing an optimal compromise between accuracy and stability, i. e. the best balance between artifacts and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While the former is based on cross-validation re-sampling technique, the second utilizes a newly introduced data consistency error (DCE) metric that exploits the shift invariance property of the reconstruction kernel to provide a goodness measure of k-space interpolation in parallel MRI. Additionally, the utility of DCE as a metric for characterizing and comparing reconstruction methods is demonstrated. Second, a DCE-based strategy is introduced to improve reconstruction efficiency in real time parallel dynamic MRI. Third, an efficient and reliable reconstruction method that operates on gridded k-space for parallel MRI using non-Cartesian trajectories is introduced with a significant computational gain for applications involving repetitive measurements. Finally, a pulse sequence that combines parallel MRI and multi-echo strategy is introduced for improving SNR and reducing the geometric distortion in diffusion tensor imaging. In addition, the sequence inherently provides a T 2 map, complementing information that can be useful for some applications. Ph. D.

40|$|High-fidelity {{rendering}} is very computationally expensive {{making it}} difficult to achieve interactive rates except for simple scenes. Recent selective rendering techniques [Yee et al. 2001; Cater et al. 2003], which alter the number of rays cast per pixel, have been explored to achieve this goal. These approaches have shown that rendering times can be significantly reduced without perceptual degradation. In traditional ray-traced <b>images</b> <b>aliasing</b> is removed by supersampling the image plane. In this sketch we identify the threshold at which decreasing the number or rays shot per pixel would result in no perceptual degradation. We conduct psychophysical experiments using four realistic environments and one test environment as a comparison. This test scene was designed to exhibit high spatial frequencies and thus was a worst case for aliasing. We determine the computational bound by varying the number of rays shot per pixel in both still images and animations. The lighting simulation system Radiance [Ward 1994] is adapted for use in these experiments. The results can be used in the design of more effective perceptual selective rendering algorithms; using the computatinal bound as an indication of where to threshold the rendering process [Sundstedt et al. 2005]. Selective rendering will alter this threshold based on perceptual importance of pixels within the image.
