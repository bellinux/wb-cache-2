500|$|On October 6, 2012, Madonna {{performed}} [...] "Everybody" [...] during The MDNA Tour in San Jose {{to celebrate}} the single's 30th anniversary. She said, [...] "Today {{is a very special}} day for me. It is the 30th anniversary of the release of my first-ever single. I remember the amazing feeling I <b>had</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> heard the song on the radio the first time." [...] Aidin Vaziri from San Francisco Chronicle commented that [...] "Three decades later, the simple synth-pop lift and naive R melody still felt amazing. It was an off-script moment that inadvertently became the highlight of the show." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{of their}} {{strained}} relationship {{during an interview}} with Hot 97.5, Minaj said: [...] "It gets {{a little hard to}} have a real connection when people are on different sides of the world, working on different things. You just never know who people got in their ear or what they're feeling or maybe they felt wronged in some way. I don't know. I just know that Drake is my baby, and Wayne is my everything." [...] However, Drake said their relationship has improved, and credited the song as opening up a new dialogue, saying: [...] "I think the dialogue actually between us was already opened up, I had already solved that issue. I wrote that a while ago, and I kinda felt guilty changing it. It was a sentiment that I <b>had</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> started this album and felt like that's how it should be. The album should start one place and end in another...I haven't talked to her since it's been out. I'm not sure. I haven't spoke to her." ...|$|E

500|$|According to the singer, she {{had written}} several songs prior {{to the release of}} Truth Serum. She confessed that both the writing and {{recording}} process of the EP was very emotional, and that the vocals of the songs were taken from her demos. Truth Serum is a concept record that details Lo's [...] "most intense" [...] relationship from beginning to end. That approach was unintentional, as Lo realized that the tracks talked about the relationship after she had picked them for the EP. She explained; [...] "I didn't plan to write it that way, but when I looked at the songs that I <b>had</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was picking ones for the EP, I was like, 'Oh my god, here it is'. I didn't really figure out {{that it was going to}} be the full story right there until I looked and listened". Concerning the title of the EP, the singer decided to call it Truth Serum after she had picked the songs for it; she said in an interview that [...] "when you look at the songs, it's all about honesty and I'm really giving up a lot of myself in these songs; I'm not filtering anything. I felt that kind of speaks a lot for how truthful the EP is".|$|E
500|$|... "New Rules" [...] {{was written}} by Caroline Ailin, Emily Warren and its {{producer}} Ian Kirkpatrick, and was included on Dua Lipa's eponymous debut studio album in 2017. Lipa worked on the record during three years, stating that the extended process led to her writing and recording songs until {{she felt she had}} a considerable amount to pick from. When asked what it was like working with younger artists like Lipa and Noah Cyrus, Warren stated that they both were [...] "older souls" [...] and that she helped them to express what they wanted to say. [...] "In both cases they were pretty comfortable telling those stories. [...] end up being true to each artist because it is coming from their story, too," [...] Warren said. Kirkpatrick also engineered and programmed the track, while Chris Gehringer mastered it and Josh Gudwin mixed it. Talking about the song, the artist explained that [...] "'New Rules' is quite different to a lot of tracks on the album. I wanted it to feel very new [...] It's the breakup song that I wish I <b>had</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was breaking up with someone" [...] and that [...] "It's about keeping your distance from someone who's bad for you. I'm setting some rules down so [...] won't go back to that person." [...] "New Rules" [...] was sent to contemporary hit radio in the United Kingdom on 21 July 2017 as the album's sixth single. It impacted the same format in the United States on 22 August 2017. Three days later, a remixed version by Australian DJ Alison Wonderland was released on iTunes.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the press}} release, Collins said {{the idea behind}} the album was [...] "not to bring {{anything}} 'new' to these already great records, but to try to recreate the sounds and feelings that I <b>had</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first heard them.

2500|$|Farnsworth said, [...] "There {{had been}} {{attempts}} {{to devise a}} television system using mechanical disks and rotating mirrors and vibrating mirrors — all mechanical.

[...] When Moore asked about others' contributions, Farnsworth agreed, [...] "There are literally thousands of inventions important to television. I hold something in excess of 165 American patents." [...] The host then asked about his current research, and the inventor replied, [...] "In television, we're attempting first to make better utilization of the bandwidth, because we think we can eventually get in excess of 2000 lines instead of 525 ... and do it on an even narrower channel ... which will make for a much sharper picture. We believe in the picture-frame type of a picture, where the visual display will be just a screen. And we hope for a memory, so that the picture will be just as though it's pasted on there." ...|$|E

2500|$|Schwartz {{said that}} {{inspiration}} for the show came from being a fan of Larry Sanders, Cameron Crowe and other [...] "quirky character-driven shows like Freaks and Geeks, Undeclared, and My So-Called Life". Schwartz went to college at the University of Southern California School of Cinema-Television, and later said that The O.C. was [...] "very much based on sort of the experiences I <b>had</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was in college" [...] as a [...] "Jewish kid from the East Coast ... surrounded by all these kids from Newport Beach who were water-polo players, and these very blonde girls who only wanted to date them. I felt very much like an outsider." [...] Although Orange County residents criticised the show's title, stating that people did not call the county by the phrase, Schwartz claims that USC students did {{say that they were}} from [...] "The O.C." [...] He also stated that Cohen family in season one resembles his own family life, adding that [...] "The dynamic between Sandy and Seth is very much based on me and my dad." [...] Schwartz reasoned that, [...] "As much as our audience enjoys living vicariously in this wealthy world, I think the true wish fulfillment comes from wishing that they had a family like the Cohens— where the parents could be that cool and that grounded and that loving, but also real parents." ...|$|E
2500|$|Frontman James Veck-Gilodi {{has spoken}} {{at length about}} the themes of each song on the album, {{describing}} them as 'very personal and each is a small story that depicts {{a part of my}} life'. Much of the album is about nostalgia, underachievement and anxiety, which are all topics which are personal to him as he wrote all the lyrics for the album. The opening track [...] "The Past Six Years", from whose lyrics the album takes its title, is described as 'an ode to... not really achieving as much as we'd have liked'. The lyrics make reference to friends and fellow bands Lower Than Atlantis and Young Guns and how James feels 'a perpetual bitterness and jealousy towards them in terms of their achievements, {{despite the fact that they}} are close friends'. [...] "I'm a Bore, Mostly" [...] also deals with the topic of underachievement, with James explaining that the song is about 'the mundane daily routine I <b>had</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was living in London. ...I couldn't deal with city life, I rarely left the house and found myself sinking into this terrible routine. I didn't really appreciate anything at the time and I had no enthusiasm'. He has claimed he wrote the song [...] "Filthy Rotten Scoundrel" [...] about himself; 'I need to learn to be grateful and appreciate the opportunities that I have been given. It's also about my fear of living, dying and never really achieving anything'. [...] "The World or Nothing" [...] continues this trend, with James describing the theme as 'the vicious cycle of feeling lost and resorting to the aid of alcohol while also feeling lost because of alcohol. It talks about how self-destructive a lot of us are and how we enjoy abusing our bodies'. Of [...] "Nelson's County", Veck-Gilodi has said: 'This song is about the county of Norfolk and how a lot of the people who reside there seem to have no real ambition other than working a 9-5, raising a family and living a normal life'.|$|E
