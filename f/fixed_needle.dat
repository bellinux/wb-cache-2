Recovery of genotype- 2 a reporter HCV from LDS syringe-needle combinations was compared to recovery from insulin syringes with <b>fixed</b> <b>needles</b> and standard HDS syringe-needle combinations. Recovery of HCV from syringes was determined immediately following their contamination with HCV-spiked plasma, after storage at 22 °C for up to 1 week, or after rinsing with water. Insulin syringes with <b>fixed</b> <b>needles</b> had the lowest proportion of HCV-positive syringes before and after storage. HCV recovery after immediate use ranged from 47 %± 4 % HCV-positive 1 mL insulin syringes with 27 -gauge ½ inch needles to 98 %± 1 % HCV-positive HDS 2 mL syringes with 23 -gauge 1 ¼ inch detachable needles.

After 3 days of storage, as much as 6 -fold differences in virus recovery was observed, with HCV recovery being lower in combinations containing LDS needles. Most combinations with detachable needles required multiple rinses to reduce HCV infectivity to undetectable levels whereas a single rinse of insulin syringes was sufficient.

40|$|The {{tendency}} of today’s {{fuel injection systems}} to reach injection pressures up to 3000 bar {{in order to meet}} forthcoming emission regulations may significantly increase liquid temperatures due to friction heating; this paper identifies numerically the importance of fuel pressurization, phase-change due to cavitation, wall heat transfer and needle valve motion on the fluid heating induced in high pressure Diesel fuel injectors. These parameters affect the nozzle discharge coefficient (Cd), fuel exit temperature, cavitation volume fraction and temperature distribution within the nozzle. Variable fuel properties, being a function of the local pressure and temperature are found necessary in order to simulate accurately the effects of depressurization and heating induced by friction forces. Comparison of CFD predictions against a 0 -D thermodynamic model, indicates that although the mean exit temperature increase relative to the initial fuel temperature is proportional to (1 − Cd 2) at <b>fixed</b> <b>needle</b> positions, it can significantly deviate from this value when the motion of the needle valve, controlling the opening and closing of the injection process, is taken into consideration. Increasing the inlet pressure from 2000 bar, which is the pressure utilized in today’s fuel systems to 3000 bar, results to significantly increased fluid temperatures above the boiling point of the Diesel fuel components and therefore regions of potential heterogeneous fuel boiling are identified...|$|E

The twenty-six cases of PC (6 from large histological samples and 20 from needle biopsies) were equally distributed into low (less than or equal to 6) or high (greater than or equal to 7) GHG groups. The p 120 nucleolar protein immunocytochemical reaction was randomly expressed in large histological sections but uniformly distributed without gaps in needle biopsy sections. Only on the latter were quantitative values of PCNA/Cyclin (23. 2 in low and 45. 3 in high GHG), Ki- 67 /MIB 1 (13. 8 in low and 43. 3 in high GHG) and AgNOR (5. 0 in low and 7. 5 in high GHG) related to those of p 120 nucleolar protein (0. 8 in low and 3. 8 in high GHG). The values of all these cell cycle markers increased from low to high GHG of PC, all four reaching high statistical significance between the two groups (ANOVA - two tailed p < 0. 0001). The PCNA/Cyclin index showed a higher positivity than the Ki- 67 /MIB 1 index in PC with low GHG but not in PC with high GHG. In conclusion, paraffin embedded and formalin fixed PC needle biopsies exhibit a higher diagnostic PCNA/Cyclin than Ki- 67 /MIB 1 index for cases presenting differentiated features, whereas p 120 nucleolar protein detection seems to be a suitable marker of poorer outcome of PC...|$|E
40|$|Copyright © 2015 SAE International. The {{design of}} a Diesel {{injector}} is {{a key factor in}} achieving higher engine efficiency. The injectors fuel atomisation characteristics are also critical for minimising toxic emissions such as unburnt Hydrocarbons (HC). However, when developing injection systems, the small dimensions of the nozzle render optical experimental investigations very challenging under realistic engine conditions. Therefore, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can be used instead. For the present work, transient, Volume Of Fluid (VOF), multiphase simulations of the flow inside and immediately downstream of a real-size multi-hole nozzle were performed, during and after the injection event with a small air chamber coupled to the injector downstream of the nozzle exit. A Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach was used to account for turbulence. Grid dependency studies were performed with 200 k- 1. 5 M cells. Both k-ε and k-ω SST models were considered in the validation process, with the k-ω SST found to predict better the injectors flow rate. The cavitation models of Schnerr-Sauer and the Zwart-Gerber-Belamri were employed for validation against optical data of cavitation in a simplified nozzle geometry obtained from the literature. The Schnerr-Sauer model was in better agreement with the experiments, hence this model was subsequently employed for the real injector simulations. The motion of the injector needle was modeled by a dynamic grid methodology. An injection pressure of 400 bar was applied at the inlet of the injector. Two outlet pressures were examined, 60 bar and 1 bar. The results showed that the flow was far from steady-state during the injection event and that hysteresis existed between the needle opening and closing phases. This indicated the importance of transient simulations, contrary to widely-used steady state simulations at <b>fixed</b> <b>needle</b> lifts. The two outlet pressures resulted in very different final states of the flow-field in the nozzle. Specifically, the nozzle ended up either full of liquid fuel at the end of injection or full of air after most of the fuel had been ejected into the chamber downstream. These predictions highlighted phenomena that can increase HC emissions due to fuel leakage, as well as processes that may be linked to different formation mechanisms of nozzle deposits...|$|E

This service had been in existence for over 20 years. Case Description This case study focuses on the consequences of the switch to mobile needle exchange services immediately after the closure and examines the impact of the closure on changes in risk behavior related to drug use, needle distribution and access to services The context surrounding the closure was also examined. Discussion and Evaluation After the closure of the fixed site exchange, access to needle exchange services decreased as evidenced by the sharp decline in numbers of clients reached, and the numbers of needles distributed and collected monthly. Reports related to needle reuse and selling of syringes suggest changes in risk behaviors. Thousands of needles remain unaccounted for in the community. To date, a new fixed site has not been found. Conclusion Closing the <b>fixed</b> site <b>needle</b> exchange had an adverse effect on already vulnerable clients and reduced access to comprehensive harm reduction services. While official public policy supports a fixed site, politicization of the issue has meant a significant setback for harm reduction with reduced potential to meet public health targets related to reducing the spread of blood borne diseases.

Until now, the transvaginal {{approach}} {{has been the only}} method of removing larger specimens from the abdominal cavity using natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery. There has been no means of extracting larger specimens in men and the means are restricted even in women, particularly in young women. The present study shows that the difficulty of large specimen retrieval can be overcome, irrespective of the diameter of the chosen port, through natural orifices using morcellation. OBJECTIVE: To show, in a porcine model, the feasibility of a complete transvesical natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) nephrectomy with kidney extraction after morcellation through the same port. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transvesical nephrectomy and morcellation were performed in six pigs at Minho University, Braga, Portugal after institutional review board approval. The transvesical port and the cystotomy were created under the guidance of a ureteroscope, while the remaining steps were done under the guidance of an operating telescope. Dissection of the renal vessels and kidney was performed using dissection grasping forceps and a vessel sealing system (LigaSure(™); Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) and morcellation was done using a Piranha(™) morcellator (Richard Wolf, Knittlingen, Germany). RESULTS: There were no complications related to the creation of transvesical access. The image provided by the telescope was superior to that of the ureteroscope, especially underwater. Morcellation was quick and effective, with the support of a <b>fixing</b> <b>needle</b> through the abdominal wall, designed to fix the kidney, after laceration of a bowel loop occurred in the first experiment.   It was found that technical improvements are needed to ensure safety of NOTES morcellation.

Scenarios were based on procedure complexity (palpation-guided or image-guided), adequacy rates (low, high) and sampling protocols (stopping criteria for ROSE and fixed sampling). One-way, probabilistic, and scenario-based sensitivity analysis was performed to determine which variables had the greatest influence on the cost difference. ROSE is favored relative to fixed sampling under the following conditions: (1) the cytologist is accurate, (2) the total variable cost ($/hr) is low, (3) fixed costs ($/procedure) are high, (4) the setup time is long, (5) the time between needle passes for ROSE is low, (6) when the per-pass adequacy rate is low, and (7) ROSE stops after observing one adequate sample.

The cost func-tion used in this paper, is based on a model of the slices and the landmark needles. The method has been used to regis-ter slices of prostates in order to create 3 D computer mod-els. Manual registration of the same prostates has been un-dertaken and compared with the results from the algorithm. Methods. Prostates from sixteen men who underwent radical prostatectomy were formalin <b>fixed</b> with landmark <b>needles,</b> sliced and the slices were computer reconstructed.

40|$|THE {{observation}} {{that led to}} the present experiment was that large macrophages are commonly present in intraperitoneal transplants of Ehrlich's ascites carcinoma (Fig. 1). As this tumour is a homograft this finding would seem to be in keeping with Baker, Weiser, Jutila, Evans and Blandau's (1962) hypothesis that these macrophages are the cells that carry the " cell-associated " antibodies that may lead to tumour homograft rejection. They have termed these cells " immune macrophages ". On the other hand as such macrophages occur with regularity in conditions other than tumour homograft rejection (Cappell, 1930) the specificity of the response described by Baker et al. (1962) becomes doubtful. The following experiment was set up in an attempt to clarify the situation. MATERIAL AND METHODS The mice and the Ehrlich's ascites carcinoma used were similar to those used in previous experiments (Hartveit, 1961). Six groups of 5 male and 5 female mice were set up. The mean starting weight of the mice in each of the groups was 19 - 2 g. (S. D. 1 g.) for the males and 16 - 2 g. (S. D. 1 - 4 g.) for the females. Experimental procedure The treatment given to the mice in the different groups is summarized in Table I. In group II the abdomen was punctured with a <b>needle</b> <b>fixed</b> to a syringe to avoid air entry. In group IV blood was obtained by cutting off the tip of the tail and collecting the drop of blood that formed in one drop of physiological saline- 0. 1 ml. of this mixture was injected. The tumour used in group V was pooled TABLE I. -The Intraperitoneal Treatment Given and the Number ofLarge Macrophage...|$|R
40|$|Summary We {{investigated}} {{effects of}} nutrient availability on shoot structure and light-interception efficiency {{based on data}} from control (C) and irrigated + fertilized (IL) trees of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). The sampling of 1 -year-old shoots was designed to cover the variation in canopy exposure within the live crown zone, where current-year shoots were still found. Canopy openness was used as a measure of light availability at the shoot’s position. Openness values for the sample shoots ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 77 on the IL plot, and from 0. 10 to 0. 96 on the C plot. Among needle dimensions, needle width increased most with canopy openness. At <b>fixed</b> canopy openness, <b>needle</b> width was larger, and the ratio of needle thickness to width was smaller in IL trees than in C trees. Specific needle area (SNA) and the ratio of shoot silhouette area to total needle area (STAR) decreased with canopy openness, so that the com-bined effect was a threefold decrease in the ratio of shoot sil-houette area to unit dry mass (SMR = STAR × SNA) along the studied range of openness values. This means that the light-in-terception efficiency of shoots per unit needle dry mass was three times higher for the most shaded shoots than for sun shoots. A test of the effect of fertilization on the relationships of SNA, STAR and SMR indicated statistically significant dif-ferences in both slope and intercept for SNA and STAR, and in the intercept for SMR. However, the differences partly cancel-led each other so that, at medium values of canopy openness, differences between treatments in predicted SNA, STAR and SMR were small. At 0. 5 canopy openness, predicted STAR of IL shoots was 6. 1 % larger than STAR of C shoots, but SMR of IL shoots was 10 % smaller than that of C shoots. The results suggest that light-interception efficiency per unit needle area or mass of the shoots is not greatly affected by fertilization...|$|R

The former {{is set in a}} round box which can be rotated in the ring {{at the end of the}} arm and can be clamped when adjusted. The arm can be rotated and can also be pulled out or in if desired, and clamped. The floor of the instrument is overlaid with cork covered with black cloth, on which the components can easily be fixed by drawing-pins. When using it, one portrait is pinned down and the other is moved near to it, overlapping its margin if necessary, until the eye looking through the prism sees the required combination; then the second portrait is pinned down also. It may now receive its register-marks from <b>needles</b> <b>fixed</b> in a hinged arm, and this is a more generally applicable method than the plan with cross threads, already described, as any desired feature--the nose, the ear, or the hand, may thus be selected for composite purposes. Let A, B, C, ... Y, Z, be the components. A is pinned down, and B, C, ... Y, Z, are successfully combined with A, and registered. Then before removing Z, take away A and substitute any other of the already registered portraits, say B, by combining it with Z; lastly, remove Z and substitute A by combining it with B, and register it. Fig. 2 shows one of three similarly jointed arms, which clamp on to the vertical covered with cork and cloth, and the other carries Fig. 3, which is a frame having lenses of different powers set into it, and on which, or on the third frame, a small mirror inclined at 45º may be laid. When a portrait requires foreshortening it can be pinned on one of these frames and be inclined to the line of sight; when it is smaller than its fellow it can be brought nearer to the eye and an appropriate lens interposed; when a right-sided profile has to be combined with a left-handed one, it must be pinned on one of the frames and viewed by reflection from the mirror in the other. The apparatus I have drawn is roughly made, and being chiefly of wood is rather clumsy, but it acts well.] ...|$|R
