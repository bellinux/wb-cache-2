50|$|A perfect grip {{depends on}} which pitch the pitcher is throwing. For a normal fastball, it is {{beneficial}} to hold the ball firmly with your fingertips, but not so that the ball is pushed deep into your palm of your hand. In fastpitch softball, there are several types of grips for various pitches. There is not one correct way to hold or throw a pitch, {{it all depends on}} the pitcher. Some grips are easier for individuals due to the size of their hand while others find certain grips more difficult. This is why younger pitchers who haven't developed into their normal hand size start with more basic grips such as the fastball. The main pitches involved in fastpitch softball are as follows: fastball, change-up, curveball, <b>drop</b> <b>ball,</b> and rise ball. Other pitches include both the drop curve, and well as the drop screw.|$|E

This study proposes a two degree-of-freedom linear mathematical model to study the impact of the soccer ball on the brain. The model consists of a mass–spring–damper system, in which the skull, the brain and the soccer ball are modelled as a mass and the neck modelled as a spring–damper system. The proposed model was compared with previous dynamic model for soccer ball-to-head impact. Moreover, it was also validated against <b>drop</b> <b>ball</b> experiment on an instrumented dummy skull and also compared with head acceleration data from previous studies. Comparison shows that our proposed model is capable of describing both the skull and brain accelerations qualitatively and quantitatively. This study shows that a simple linear mathematical model can be useful in giving a preliminary insight on the kinematics of human skull and brain during a ball-to-head impact. The model can be used to investigate the important parameters during soccer heading that affect the brain displacement and acceleration, thus providing better understanding of the mechanics behind it...|$|E

40|$|Multiple {{sectioned}} {{shafts of}} carbon fibre composite were modelled using Composite Design Analysis software {{in order to}} replicate the range of flexural rigidities shown across the current field hockey stick market. The shafts were then manufactured using hand lay-up and hot-pressing techniques, tested under static and dynamic conditions and the goodness of {{their relationship with the}} modelled behaviour was assessed. The shafts were also analysed microscopically for volume fraction, ply-orientation and the interaction between the varied lay-up sections. The modelling gave a good understanding of the trend of behaviour that was to be expected, but was not accurate enough to predict experimental values. It is possible to create multiple sectioned CFRP shafts that can be controlled for overall flexural rigidity and also strain distribution or “kick-point”. The hand lay-up and hot pressing technique produces consistent volume fraction and accurate fibre orientation, however the seams at which the sections join requires further investigation and development. The relationship between stick stiffness and ball speed validated previous research, stiffer shafts produced a higher CoR in the <b>drop</b> <b>ball</b> test. There is scope to introduce this stiffness control of the bending behaviour into hockey sticks, by either material properties or section moment of area. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThere {{has been}} a long debate among {{researchers}} on whether soccer heading is capable of causing brain trauma. A recent study suggests that headings exceeding a threshold level of 855 to 1, 550 per year, results in microstructural abnormalities in the brain's white matter. This shows that brain trauma is caused by cumulative effect of repetitive headings. The use of protective headgear is one of the suggested preventive measures to protect the brain especially for younger players. Researchers have tested several commercial headgears and found that they are only effective in head-to-head impact, but ineffective in attenuating impact caused by heading. This {{is due to the fact}} that soccer ball is compliant in nature relative to the head. The aim of this study is to investigate materials that can be utilised to minimise the acceleration of the brain caused by soccer heading. A vertical <b>drop</b> <b>ball</b> test was conducted on an instrumented dummy skull. The inner cavity of the skull is filled with ultrasound gel that represents the brain. Six impact-absorbing materials were tested to determine the most effective material that reduces the acceleration of the brain substitute. The speed of the ball before and after impact as well as impact duration were measured using high-speed camera. Coefficient of restitution was calculated to ensure the material is not only capable of reducing the brain acceleration, but also maintains heading performance. It was found that polymer kneepad foam is the most effective material that minimises the acceleration of brain substitute whilst maintaining the speed of the ball after impact...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe present paper {{deals with}} damage {{mechanisms}} in soda-lime glass subjected to particle impacts. Sandblasting experiments on glass using small-sized particles were performed and resulting damaged sites {{were analyzed by}} means of a 3 D optical profilometer. A particular attention is paid to determine the different morphologies of imprints and cracks with regard to particle size and impact velocity. The impacted sites show that damage patterns fairly coincide with those caused by static indentation; localized deformation and cracks nucleation are generated close to the impact zone. According to our previous work concerning the damage due to static indentation in glass (Ismail et al., Computational Materials Science 42 (2008) 407 - 415 [18]), the current paper takes advantage of the continuum damage mechanics (CDM) approach to simulate, via finite element analysis, the erosion behavior of soda-lime glass impacted with small-sized particles. Experimental data obtained by means of split Hopkinson pressure bar and <b>drop</b> <b>ball</b> tests are used to identify the parameters of the anisotropic stress-based damage evolution law. It is shown that the implemented anisotropic stress-based CDM model is able to predict the impact damage patterns experimentally observed. It is further shown that the removed volume in one impact site measured by 3 D profilometry is well captured by the anisotropic CDM model coupled with a vanishing element technique. The dependence of material removal on the particle size and velocity is numerically studied and the trends are identified. The crater sizes predicted by the damage model are then compared with empirical models proposed in the literature to describe the velocity dependency of erosion...|$|E

40|$|Magnetic fluids are {{colloidal}} dispersions {{of magnetic}} nanoparticles that are stable {{with respect to}} gravitational and moderate magnetic fields because of their small particle size, and to unbounded aggregation due to their surface coatings. The interaction between individual magnetic nanoparticles in a suspension is negligible even under applied magnetic fields. However, when they are incorporated into composite structures they act in concert to provide the desired magnetic response. The dynamic response of such composite structures can be exploited {{in a wide range}} of applications including high energy absorption scenarios. The goal of this thesis was to use magnetic nanoparticles as building blocks to create 3 D magneto-responsive nanostructures and manipulate their behavior in the presence of an external magnetic field for various applications. Two approaches were followed to create composite structures. In the first approach, rigid magnetic chains composed of magnetic nanoparticles were synthesized. The layer-by-layer technique was used to coat polystyrene beads with magnetic nanoparticles to create novel core-shell structures. The behavior of these structures under an applied magnetic field was modeled and the results were verified experimentally. (cont.) These magnetic polystyrene beads were then aligned within a microchannel by an external magnetic field and linked together using sol gel chemistry to yield rigid superparamagnetic chains. Linking the magnetically aligned beads with a flexible linker yielded flexible superparamagnetic chains. These permanently-linked magnetic chains can be used as micro-mixers in a microfluidic channel under a rotating magnetic field. The reorientation dynamics of these chains under an external magnetic field was modeled. Microcontact printing was employed to tether the flexible chains in a desired pattern on a glass surface. Tethered flexible magnetic chains have potential applications in microfluidics and separations. Rings and icosahedra shaped electrostatically charged templates were generated from the self-assembly of mixtures of surfactants in an aqueous solution and were investigated for their application in the synthesis of non-spherical magnetic structures. The magnetic response of the magnetic rings was modeled and the results were verified experimentally. "Templateless" aggregation of magnetic nanoparticles using radiation crosslinking was also investigated. (cont.) Aqueous magnetic nanoparticles stabilized with a radiation crosslinkable polymer resulted in magnetic gels at high dosage amount of the ionizing radiation. Magnetic gels can have potential applications in biological areas. Different size monodisperse magnetic nanoparticles were synthesized via an organic synthesis route, and the effect of size on the Nel relaxation behavior of the fixed magnetic nanoparticles was investigated. Theoretical analysis suggested that incorporation of magnetic nanoparticles with high relaxation times in a matrix can be used to absorb energy. The energy penalty associated with the deflection of the magnetic dipole against the field should result in the stiffening of the matrix. This was demonstrated both experimentally and theoretically. <b>Drop</b> <b>ball</b> impact test was performed on foam embedded with infinite Nel relaxation nanoparticles and the deflection profile of the foam was monitored both in the presence and in the absence of a magnetic field. The deflection of the foam by the ball was modeled to calculate the strain profile developed by the foam, which was then converted into the equivalent amount of energy absorbed by the foam and the magnetic nanoparticles. (cont.) A method of electrospinning was used to encapsulate magnetic nanoparticles in a polymeric matrix to create field responsive nanofibers for various applications. The magnetization properties of the nanofibers were also characterized and their behavior under an applied magnetic field was modeled. by Harpreet Singh. Thesis (Ph. D.)
