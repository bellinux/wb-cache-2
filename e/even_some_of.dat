5|$|The serial sees Professor Bernard Quatermass of the British Experimental Rocket Group {{being asked}} to examine strange {{meteorite}} showers.

5|$|In 1858, Dow won {{a special}} {{election}} to the Maine House of Representatives as a Republican {{when one of the}} members elected declined to serve. He won reelection to a full term in 1859, and continued to agitate for stricter prohibition laws, but was unsuccessful. He also became entangled in scandal when the State Treasurer, Benjamin D. Peck, lent out state funds to private citizens (including Dow) contravening state law. Peck lent large sums to himself, which were lost when his business ventures failed. Dow had guaranteed some of Peck's borrowing, and faced ruin as it became clear that Peck could not repay the state treasury. Dow was able to settle the debts and conceal much of his role in the affair, but enough of the scandal became known that some of his many enemies attacked him in local newspapers. <b>Even</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his prohibitionist allies became less openly supportive of him. In September 1860, he did not run for re-election.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that the atrocities that Las Casas described were exaggerated or even invented, {{but this is not}} generally considered likely as Las Casas was far from the only person to be deeply worried about abuse and mistreatment of the Indians. The Dominican friars Antonio de Montesinos and Pedro de Córdoba had reported extensive violence already {{in the first decade of}} the conquest of the Indies, and throughout the conquest of the Americas there were reports of abuse of the natives by friars and priests and ordinary citizens, and many massacres of indigenous people were reported in full by those who perpetrated them. <b>Even</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Las Casas's enemies, such as Toribio de Benavente Motolinia, reported many gruesome atrocities committed against the Indians by the colonizers. All in all, modern historians tend to disregard the numerical figures given by Las Casas, but maintain that the general picture he presented of an intensely violent and abusive conquest did represent reality.|$|E

5|$|Pinkerton, who in 1816 was the BFBS's {{representative}} in Moscow, had met that {{year with a}} community of Albanians in Vienna, then capital of the Austrian Empire. They assured him that a translation of the New Testament into Albanian was indeed possible. In {{a letter to his}} superiors at the BFBS, dated August 28, 1816, Pinkerton wrote that the Albanian nation occupied {{a large part of the}} ancient Illyria, that they spoke a language completely different from Slavic, Turkish, Greek, or Latin, and that for the Albanian Orthodox the mass was recited in Greek, a language that believers and <b>even</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the priests did not understand. According to Pinkerton, the translation could be done by one or more Albanians from the Ionian islands under the supervision of an Albanian bishop.|$|E
5|$|The Andromeda Galaxy {{is bright}} enough {{to be seen with}} the naked eye, even with some light pollution. Andromeda is best seen during autumn nights in the Northern Hemisphere, when from {{mid-latitudes}} the galaxy reaches zenith and can be seen almost all night. From the Southern Hemisphere, it is a springtime object and does not reach a high altitude over the northern horizon, thus making it difficult to observe. Binoculars can reveal some larger structures and its two brightest satellite galaxies, M32 and M110. An amateur telescope can reveal Andromeda's disk, dark dust lanes, the large star cloud NGC 206, and <b>even</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> its brightest globular clusters.|$|E
5|$|Captain Smith was an {{experienced}} seaman {{who had served}} for 40 years at sea, including 27 years in command. This was the first real crisis of his career, and he most certainly {{would have known that}} even if all the boats were fully occupied, more than a thousand people would remain on the ship as she went down with little or no chance of survival. As Smith began to grasp the enormity of what was about to happen, he appears to have become paralysed by indecision. He had ordered passengers and crew to muster, but from that point onward, he failed to order his officers to put the passengers into the lifeboats; he did not adequately organise the crew; he failed to convey crucial information to his officers and crew; he sometimes gave ambiguous or impractical orders and he never gave the command to abandon ship. <b>Even</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his bridge officers were unaware for some time after the collision that the ship was sinking; Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall did not find out until 01:15, barely an hour before the ship went down, while Quartermaster George Rowe was so unaware of the emergency that after the evacuation had started, he phoned the bridge from his watch station to ask why he had just seen a lifeboat go past. Smith did not inform his officers that the ship did not have enough lifeboats to save everyone. He did not supervise the loading of the lifeboats and seemingly made no effort to find out if his orders were being followed.|$|E

5|$|During Roman times, Volubilis {{was a major}} {{producer}} of olive oil. The remains of buildings dedicated to olive pressing are still readily visible, as are {{the remains of the}} original presses and olive mills. One such building has been reconstructed with a full-size replica of a Roman olive press. Olive oil was central {{to the life of the}} city, as it was not just a foodstuff but was also used for lamps, bathing and medicines, while the pressed olives were fed to animals or dried out and used as fuel for the bathhouses. For this reason, <b>even</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the grandest mansions had their own olive presses. Fifty-eight oil-pressing complexes have so far been discovered in Volubilis. They housed a standard set of elements: a mill, used to crush the olives, a decantation basin to catch the oil from pressed olives, and a press that comprised a counterweight, a prelum or cross-bar and the wooden supports within which the prelum was fixed. The olives were first crushed into a paste, then put into woven baskets that were subjected to pressing. The olive oil ran out into the decantation basin, to which water was periodically added to make the lighter oil float to the surface. This was then scooped out of the basin and poured into amphorae. There is also substantial evidence of the city being a lively commercial centre. No fewer than 121 shops have been identified so far, many of them bakeries, and judging from the number of bronzes found at the site it may also have been a centre for the production or distribution of bronze artworks.|$|E
5|$|In 1535, the abbey's {{income was}} only {{assessed}} at £155 in the Valor Ecclesiasticus, Henry VIII's great survey of church finances. It meant {{the following year}} that it came {{under the terms of}} the first Suppression Act, Henry's initial move in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Abbot William Dovell and his 16monks were forced to surrender the abbey on 6 September 1536. There were proposals from local gentry and <b>even</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the king's officials for the Dissolution such as Sir Thomas Arundell that Cleeve should be granted a reprieve, as a number of others among the smaller monasteries were, however, it was not to be and the monks finally left in the spring of 1537. Abbot William was given a pension of 40marks per year, not large but certainly comfortable, which he was still drawing 20years later. Most of the other monks were given pensions too. One former monk of Cleeve rose to prominence and came to a sticky end. This was John Hooper who became Bishop of Gloucester and Worcester and was killed in 1555 for his Protestant beliefs by Mary I.|$|E
