5000|$|Likewise, work {{flexibility}} affects job satisfaction. In fact, {{the flexibility}} to decide when work is performed ranks number one among women and number two or three among men in determining {{the characteristics of a}} satisfying job. Similar to job autonomy, <b>job</b> <b>flexibility</b> is more important than income when evaluating job satisfaction. [...] Flexibility to determine one's work schedule is an important contributor to job satisfaction across the spectrum of low- and high-income jobs. Work flexibility empowers employees by reducing the incidence of work-family conflicts and engagement in planned quitting to improve overall quality of life. Positive affect is a fringe benefit of work flexibility that pays rich dividends to both employees and their employers, empowering the former and improving the ability of the latter to retain workers.|$|E
50|$|The US Rehabilitation Act of 1973 {{requires}} all {{organizations that}} receive government funding to provide accessibility programs and services. A more recent law, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), which came {{into effect in}} 1992, prohibits private employers, state and local governments, employment agencies and labor unions from discriminating against qualified individuals with disabilities in job application procedures, hiring, firing, advancement, compensation, job training, or in the terms, conditions and privileges of employment. This includes organizations like retail businesses, movie theaters, and restaurants. They must make reasonable accommodation to people with different needs. Protection is extended to anyone with (A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits {{one or more of}} the major life activities of an individual, (B) a record of such an impairment, or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment. The second and third criteria are seen as ensuring protection from unjust discrimination based on a perception of risk, just because someone has a record of impairment or appears to have a disability or illness (e.g. features which may be erroneously taken as signs of an illness). Employment protection laws make discrimination against qualified individuals with a disability illegal and may also require provision of reasonable accommodation. Reasonable accommodations includes changes in the physical environment like making facilities more accessible but also include increasing <b>job</b> <b>flexibility</b> like job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules or reassignment to vacant position. Though many hold attitudes that are more enlightened and informed than past years, the word “disability” carries few positive connotations for most employers. Negative attitudes by employers toward potential employees with disabilities can lead to misunderstanding and discrimination.|$|E
5000|$|The {{types of}} jobs and roles within police {{departments}} are varied. These include [...] "beat cops" [...] patrolling around given neighborhoods, rotating patrol jobs, event and security details. Other positions include detectives, unit officers and supervisors, as well as administrative roles. These positions often come with more status, pay, and flexibility. Women hold, as of 2010, 7.3% of these upper level and supervisory roles. Interestingly, {{studies have shown that}} some policewomen do not feel comfortable about seeking out promotions due to issues related to tokenism, (i.e. they did not want peers to assume their promotion was due to their being one of the few females in the department), or, relatedly, feeling like the promotional process was biased toward their male counterparts. Women also mentioned a concern for the impact of schedule change and less <b>job</b> <b>flexibility</b> would have on their families. These sentiments are tied to the concept of the [...] "brass ceiling", a turn of phrase meant to describe the limited opportunities for advancement for females in the police force and military. Extremely specialized roles, such as SWAT team members, are perhaps exempt from some of the assumptions around tokenism given their rigorous qualifications for entry, but also present unique challenges for integration into the unit culture. A 2011 study argues that women in SWAT teams often need to [...] "join the boys club" [...] and may be relegated to specific roles, such as hostage negotiator, because of beliefs about female capacity for empathy and compassionate communication. This study also concludes that although tokenism is perhaps not an issue with regard to entry into SWAT team work, it remains salient with respect to promotion opportunities, mirroring women's opinions about promotion in other facets of the police force.|$|E

I then propose {{that the effects of}} self-employment on work-to-family conflict and family-to-work conflict for women are moderated by occupational level and household responsibilities.

The present research examines the associations between unemployed individuals' work values and their attitudes towards <b>job</b> <b>flexibility.</b> Consistent with Expectancy-Value Theory, {{results showed that the}} general concept of employment value was positively related to all measured types of flexibility, that is, training flexibility, pay flexibility, the flexibility to accept an undemanding job, and the flexibility to accept a job for which one is over-qualified. In line with Self-Determination Theory, holding an intrinsic work value orientation related positively to training and pay flexibility, whereas extrinsic work value orientation was negatively related to these two types of flexibility. Overall, these results indicate that not only the degree of employment value but also the content of unemployed individuals' work value orientations matter in understanding their <b>job</b> <b>flexibility...</b>|$|E

It has a mixed model of employment that includes factories, individualized employment support and supported employment. It does not have dedicated funding for supported employment however and these services rely on a jigsaw of funding. There has been a shift to bring people with health problems on welfare benefit into employment on health and cost grounds. Results: 45. 6 % of disabled people are employed compared to 76. 2 % for non-disabled people. Relative measures of employment advantage suggest that the situation for disabled people is getting worse. There has been {{a shift in the}} last 10 years from allocation to a programme to a more individualised service response and from factory to community employment. People with learning disabilities, autism and mental health problems remain relative poorly served. Conclusions: If inclusion is to be achieved {{there is a need for}} adequate investment in the intensity and type of employment support appropriate to the needs of the person. Consideration should be given to policies that improve the availability of <b>jobs,</b> <b>flexibility</b> and inclusiveness among employers as well as measure that focus on the disabled person...|$|R

40|$|The {{benefits}} of workplace health promotion programmes for organisations are well documented. However, {{the problem of}} low employee participation has continued to challenge managers, and {{is an area that}} has received relatively little attention in health promotion literature, particularly in New Zealand. The purpose of this investigation is to develop {{a better understanding of the}} variables predicting, and the barriers preventing, employee participation in health promotion activities. Thereby assisting managers to maximise participation rates and develop successful workplace health promotion initiatives. This research centred on identifying and assessing the predictors and barriers to employee participation in nine health promotion activities commonly offered in New Zealand organisations. The data collection process included an initial preliminary study, followed by a large online questionnaire completed by 883 New Zealand employees. These results led to developing an in–depth qualitative study, involving semi–structured face–to–face interviews with 20 employees, designed to triangulate and add further depth in understanding the factors that influence employee participation in health promotion programmes. Research results determined that the likelihood of an employee participating is best predicted by their age, gender, perceived stress, job satisfaction, supervisor support, organisational health climate, and degree of perceived <b>job</b> <b>flexibility.</b> Conversely, the barriers preventing participation included activities scheduled at inconvenient times, a lack of information about the activities, excessive work and family commitments, low <b>job</b> <b>flexibility,</b> low self–efficacy, feeling embarrassed, and a lack of trust in supervisors. Maintaining participation was achieved through continuously changing activities, and constant communication with participating staff. To maximise participation, the present investigation recommends that managers consider the organisation’s environment, by way of managerial support and cultivating a positive organisational health climate, schedule activities during normal working hours and provide time off for employees to take part, allow greater <b>job</b> <b>flexibility,</b> fully subsidise any financial costs, and ensure all employee health information is secure.
