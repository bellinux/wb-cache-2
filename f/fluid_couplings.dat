40|$|If general {{relativity}} {{is the correct}} theory of physics on large scales, {{then there is a}} differential equation that relates the Hubble expansion function, inferred from measurements of angular diameter distance and luminosity distance, to the growth rate of large scale structure. For a dark energy <b>fluid</b> without <b>couplings</b> or an unusual sound speed, deviations from this consistency relationship could be the signature of modified gravity on cosmological scales. We propose a procedure based on this consistency relation in order to distinguish between some dark energy models and modified gravity models. The procedure uses different combinations of cosmological observations and is able to find inconsistencies when present. As an example, we apply the procedure to a universe described by a recently proposed 5 -dimensional modified gravity model. We show that this leads to an inconsistency within the dark energy parameter space detectable by future experiments.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is the {{derivation}} of the integrated Sachs–Wolfe (iSW) effect in cosmologies with coupled dark matter and dark energy <b>fluids.</b> These <b>couplings</b> influence the iSW effect in three ways: the Hubble function assumes a different scaling, the structure growth rate shows a different time evolution and, in addition, the Poisson equation, which relates the density perturbations to fluctuations in the gravitational potential, is changed, due to the violation of the scaling ρ ∝ a− 3 of the matter density ρ with scalefactor a. Exemplarily, I derive the iSW spectra for a model in which dark matter decays into dark energy, investigate the influence of the dark matter decay rate and the dark energy equation of state on the iSW signal, and discuss the analogies for gravitational lensing. Quite generally, iSW measurements should reach similar accuracy in determining the dark energy equation of state parameter and the coupling constant.

40|$|A {{system for}} mating <b>fluid</b> {{transfer}} <b>couplings</b> is constructed having a male connector which {{is provided with}} a pair of opposed rollers mounted to an exterior region thereof. A male half of a fluid transfer coupling is rotatably supported in an opening in an end of the connector and is equipped with an outwardly extending forward portion. The forward portion locks into an engagement and locking region of a female half of the fluid transfer coupling, with female half being rotatably supported in a receptacle. The receptacle has an opening aligned with locking region, with this opening having a pair of concentric, annularly disposed ramps extending around an interior portion of opening. These ramps are inclined toward the interior of the receptacle and are provided with slots through which rollers of the connector pass. After the connector is inserted into the receptacle (engaging forward portion into engagement region), relative rotation between the connector and receptacle causes the rollers to traverse ramps until the rollers abut and are gripped by retainers. This axially forces the forward portion into locked, sealed engagement with the engagement region...|$|R
25|$|A linear Fresnel {{reflector}} {{power plant}} uses {{a series of}} long, narrow, shallow-curvature (or even flat) mirrors to focus light onto one or more linear receivers positioned above the mirrors.

This {{is similar to the}} trough design (and different from central towers and dishes with dual-axis). The receiver is stationary and so <b>fluid</b> <b>couplings</b> are not required (as in troughs and dishes). The mirrors also do not need to support the receiver, so they are structurally simpler.

2500|$|The harsh {{operating}} {{conditions of the}} arctic seas placed high requirements on the strength, reliability and redundancy of the propulsion machinery, especially for single-screw ships operating independently without icebreaker escort. For this reason the robust propulsion system had several innovative features and prototype arrangements to improve the ship's operational capability. Propulsion power was provided by two 14-cylinder Wärtsilä-Sulzer 14ZV40/48 4-stroke medium-speed diesel engines running on heavy fuel oil, each with a maximum continuous output of [...] at 560 rpm. As a precaution against failure of the propeller pitch control mechanism the main engines were directly reversible. The main engines were connected to a single propeller shaft through a double input/single output single-stage reduction gear equipped with separate multi disc clutches and Voith <b>fluid</b> <b>couplings.</b> The hydrodynamic couplings that allowed over 100% slipping between {{input and output shafts}} were used in difficult ice conditions to increase propeller torque and protect the main engines from large torque variations resulting from propeller blades hitting the ice. The fully locking mechanical clutches were used to improve fuel efficiency when the ship was operating in open water or light ice conditions. Because the power output per shaft of the SA-15 class freighters was at that time one of the highest among icebreaking ships, second only to the Arktika class nuclear icebreakers, the propeller of the ship was of extremely robust design. The four-bladed stainless steel controllable-pitch propeller was developed and manufactured by KaMeWa specially for the SA-15 project.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{liquid cargo}} {{movement}} within a partly-filled tank truck affects its braking, roll dynamics and directional performance in an adverse manner. In this study, the braking {{performance of a}} partly-filled tank truck equipped with different baffles designs is investigated considering dynamic fluid-structure interactions. The validity of the computational fluid dynamic model is examined through laboratory tests conducted on a scale model tank with and without baffles. The measured responses to harmonic excitations revealed three-dimensional nature of the <b>fluid</b> motion and <b>couplings</b> between the lateral and longitudinal fluid slosh. Several spectral components were observed for the transient slosh forces, which could {{be associated with the}} excitation, resonance, and beat frequencies. A dynamic pitch plane model of a Tridem truck incorporating three-dimensional fluid slosh dynamics is subsequently developed to analyze the fluid-vehicle interactions under straight-line braking maneuvers. The results show that the vehicle responses are highly influenced by the slosh-induced force and moment...|$|R
40|$|Relativistic non-ideal fluid {{dynamics}} is formulated in 3 + 1 space [...] time dimensions. The equations governing dissipative relativistic hydrodynamics {{are given in}} terms of the time and the 3 -space quantities which correspond to those familiar from non-relativistic physics. Dissipation is accounted for by applying the causal theory of relativistic dissipative {{fluid dynamics}}. As a special case we consider a <b>fluid</b> without viscous/heat <b>couplings</b> in the causal system of transport/relaxation equations. For the study of physical systems we consider pure (1 + 1) -dimensional expansion in planar geometry, (1 + 1) -dimensional spherically symmetric (fireball) expansion, (1 + 1) -dimensional cylindrically symmetric expansion and a (2 + 1) -dimensional expansion with cylindrical symmetry in the transverse plane (firebarell expansion). The transport/relaxation equations are given {{in terms of the}} spatial components of the dissipative fluxes, since these are not independent.

40|$|While often {{sufficiently}} accurate, approaches using rotor {{dynamics and}} bladed disc dynamics are not {{adapted to the}} study of certain important cases, i. e., when observing wheel/shaft coupling or when fluid elements are strongly coupled with local structural deformations. The approach proposed here is a step toward a global model of shaft lines. The whole flexible wheel/shaft assembly and the influence of specific fluid film elements are considered in a full threedimensional model. A modal projection associated with a grid located at the interface of the fluid and structural domains provides an efficient and adaptable coupling. The equations governing the whole system are solved within a time marching procedure which alternatively considers the equations of fluid and structure. The technique chosen is applied to two different test cases. The first is composed of a disc and a thin-walled shaft mounted on a hydrodynamic bearing. The second is intended for studying a more realistic structure composed of a shaft and a wheel coupled with a fluid film between the wheel and a casing. These applications make it possible to identify trends related to <b>fluid</b> effects and <b>couplings</b> between the flexible structural parts...|$|R
