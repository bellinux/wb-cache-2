25|$|The Coptic {{population}} in Egypt {{is difficult to}} estimate because researchers are forbidden by Egyptian authorities <b>from</b> <b>asking</b> a survey participant’s religion, but some official estimates state that Coptic Christians represent from 5 to 10 percent or less of a population of over 83 million Egyptians while other independent and Christian sources estimate much higher numbers, up to 23 percent of the population.|$|E
25|$|According to Pierre Bourdieu “the {{principal}} {{obstacle to}} a rigorous {{science of the}} production of the value of cultural goods” is the “charismatic ideology of ‘creation’ “ which can be easily found in studies of art, literature and other cultural fields.

40|$|Redox-sensing {{molecules}} such as thioredoxin (TRX) and glutaredoxin (GRX) bind to apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK 1) and suppress its activation. Glucose deprivation {{disrupted the}} interaction between TRX/GRX and ASK 1 and subsequently activated the ASK 1 -stress-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase kinase-c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK 1) signal-transduction pathway. L-Buthionine-(S, R) -sulphoximine, which decreases intracellular glutathione content, enhanced glucose deprivation-induced activation of JNK 1 by promoting the dissociation of TRX, but not GRX, <b>from</b> <b>ASK</b> 1. Treatment of cells with exogenous glutathione disulphide ester resulted in the dissociation of GRX, but not TRX, <b>from</b> <b>ASK</b> 1 and the subsequent activation of JNK 1. Nonetheless, overexpression of calatase, an H(2) O(2) scavenger, inhibited JNK 1 activation and cytotoxicity {{as well as the}} dissociation of TRX and GRX <b>from</b> <b>ASK</b> 1 during combined glucose deprivation and L-buthionine-(S, R) -sulphoximine treatment. Taken together, glucose deprivation-induced metabolic oxidative stress may activate ASK 1 through two different pathways: glutathione-dependent GRX-ASK 1 and glutathione-independent TRX-ASK 1 pathways...|$|R

25|$|Poitier was {{the first}} male actor of African (Bahamian) descent to be {{nominated}} for a competitive Academy Award (for The Defiant Ones, 1958). He {{was also the first}} actor of African descent to win the Academy Award for Best Actor (for Lilies of the Field in 1963). (James Baskett {{was the first}} African American male to receive an Oscar, an Honorary Academy Award for his performance as Uncle Remus in the Walt Disney production of Song of the South in 1948, while Hattie McDaniel predated them both, winning as Best Supporting Actress for her role in 1939's Gone with the Wind, making her the first person of African descent to be nominated for and receive an Oscar). His satisfaction at this honor was undermined by his concerns that this award was more of the industry congratulating itself for having him as a token and it would inhibit him <b>from</b> <b>asking</b> for more substantive considerations afterward. Poitier worked relatively little over the following year; he remained the only major actor of African descent and the roles offered were predominantly typecast as a soft-spoken appeaser.|$|E
25|$|In England and Wales, sex {{education}} is not compulsory in schools as parents can refuse to let their children {{take part in the}} lessons. The curriculum focuses on the reproductive system, foetal development, and the physical and emotional changes of adolescence, while information about contraception and safe sex is discretionary and discussion about relationships is often neglected. Britain {{has one of the highest}} teenage pregnancy rates in Europe and {{sex education}} is a heated issue in government and media reports. In a 2000 study by the University of Brighton, many 14- to 15-year-olds reported disappointment with the content of sex education lessons and felt that lack of confidentiality prevents teenagers <b>from</b> <b>asking</b> teachers about contraception. However, in a 2008 study conducted by YouGov for Channel 4 it was revealed that only three in ten teenagers say they need more sex and relationships education. In most primary/junior schools, students are taught a (non-compulsory) formal sex education program from Upper Key Stage 2 (ages 10–11), and then onwards into secondary school, where it becomes a topic in the overall subject of Citizenship or PSHE (Personal Social Health Education). In March 2017 it was made complusory all schools have to teach sex education.|$|E

25|$|One such {{story is}} that of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi. The rabbi, a friend of Elijah’s, was asked what favor he might wish. The rabbi {{answered}} only that {{he be able to}} join Elijah in his wanderings. Elijah granted his wish only if he refrained <b>from</b> <b>asking</b> any questions about any of the prophet’s actions. He agreed and they began their journey. The first place they came to was the house of an elderly couple who were so poor they had only one old cow. The old couple gave of their hospitality as best they could. The next morning, as the travelers left, Elijah prayed that the old cow would die and it did. The second place they came to was the home of a wealthy man. He had no patience for his visitors and chased them away with the admonition that they should get jobs and not beg from honest people. As they were leaving, they passed the man’s wall {{and saw that it was}} crumbling. Elijah prayed that the wall be repaired and it was so. Next, they came to a wealthy synagogue. They were allowed to spend the night with only the smallest of provisions. When they left, Elijah prayed that every member of the synagogue might become a leader.|$|E
25|$|Information {{provided}} in koseki is detailed and sensitive and makes discrimination possible against such groups as burakumin or illegitimate children and unwed mothers, for example. As the burakumin liberation movement gained strength in postwar Japan some {{changes were made}} to family registries. In 1974 a notice that prohibited employers <b>from</b> <b>asking</b> prospective employees to show their family registry was released by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. In 1975 one's lineage name was deleted and in 1976 access to family registries was restricted. As of April 2007, anyone interested was eligible to {{get a copy of}} someone else's koseki. However, on May 1, 2008, a new law was implemented to limit the persons eligible for a copy to the persons whose names are recorded in a given koseki and those who need such a copy to exercise their due rights (debt collectors, executors of wills). Anyone who is listed on a koseki, even if their name has been crossed off by reason of divorce and even if they are not a Japanese citizen, is eligible to get a copy of that koseki. One can obtain a copy in person or by mail. Lawyers can also obtain copies of any koseki if a person listed is involved in legal proceedings.|$|E
