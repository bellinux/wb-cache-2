40|$|Family firms span {{from small}} where the founder {{is the only}} person in the company to large {{corporations}} that are listed at the stock exchange. Moreover, they differ culturally depending on the home country of the respective firm. However, what all family firms have in common is that they constitute a large part of the total amount of firms in the world providing employment opportunities and thus contributing to the welfare of countries. This fact makes family firms a highly interesting field of research. On the one hand family firms have many competitive advantages over other firms such as majority control of shares allowing fast decisions as well as customer and long-term orientation. On the other hand family firms face difficulties that non-family firms do not. One of the most common problems of family firms is its long-term survival which can be hindered by a lack of family members that can and want to take over, control issues due to family members who sold their shares, insufficient innovation, growth or profitability. That problem leads to the two main questions which will be analyzed in this thesis: a.) “Why do many small Swedish family firms often not survive in the long run?” b.) “What can be done to increase the survival rate of small family firms in a long term perspective?” Past and current research focused a lot on large family firms even though companies with less than 50 employees constitute approximately 96 percent of all firms in Sweden. Therefore, the thesis concentrates on small family firms in Sweden. Data needed for the analysis in order to answer the questions stated above have been gathered by a survey followed up by an interview to test and compliment the results of the survey. The results of the survey indicate that the main reason why small family firms in Sweden often do not survive in the long run is because they do not want to. Reasons why they were not <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> long-term survival several state that there are no relatives that can take-over. Based on the results of the survey an attempt to answer the question what can be done to increase the survival rate was as follows: For the family firms not <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>succession</b> the benefits of long-term survival such as better products and services, wealth for owners, jobs and tax income for society were presented. For the ones <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>succession</b> but facing difficulties recommendations such as the introduction of governance mechanisms were suggested. To test and compliment the results from the survey a telephone interview was performed with a few of the survey respondents get more in-depth information and opinions of the small family firms. The results of the interview validate the results of the survey...|$|R

500|$|Eorcenberht was {{the king}} of Kent at Wulfhere's accession, and the two {{families}} became connected when Wulfhere married Eorcenberht's daughter Eormenhild.

Wulfhere may have had an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the <b>succession,</b> as through his marriage to Eormenhild he was the uncle of Egbert's two sons, Eadric and Wihtred.

Another Mercian connection to Kent was through Merewalh, {{the king of}} the Magonsæte, and hence a subking under Wulfhere.

40|$|There is {{a strong}} need for successors in SMEs in Western {{innovative}} economies. This research paper investigates qualitatively if students change their entrepreneurial entry preference if they are presented different kinds of entrepreneurial entry options. We propose that students’ preferences are mediated by Threshold Theory: choice options, opportunity costs and psychological income. The qualitative analyses, using 31 case studies, corroborate most of our propositions, also showing that human capital (entrepreneurial and management experience) and traits (perseverance, flexibility, creativity and risk tolerance) and competencies (market awareness, network building) are related towards choice options and opportunity costs. By presenting different modes of entrepreneurial entry we observe a shift in students’ preference from start-up entrepreneurship towards franchising. Though students show a clear <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> family <b>succession</b> or firm acquisitions they are held back by financial thresholds (the higher need for financial capital) {{and a lack of}} human capital (entrepreneurial or management experience).

50|$|Beltrán de la Cueva is, however, {{best known}} for {{allegedly}} {{having an affair with}} Henry's second wife, Joan of Portugal. It was rumoured that Henry's only child, Joan was fathered by Beltrán and not by the King himself, who may have been impotent. This rumour led to a four-year War of the Castilian Succession, which was won by Isabella I, Henry's half-sister. It is unlikely that an agreement as to Joan's probable paternity will ever be reached by historians, as there is not enough evidence to support either possible father with certainty. Most of the extant contemporary sources about Henry's potency are suspect, as the royal chronicles of his reign were either written or revised under the influence of Isabella, whose personal <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the <b>succession</b> caused her to take great pains to insist on Joan's illegitimacy. Much of Isabella's attention to Henry, in fact, was spent on harming his reputation in order to cement the legitimacy of her own reign. The question of Joan's paternity has, as a result, fascinated historians for centuries: if Joan was not in fact Beltran's daughter, and was actually legitimate, Isabella's tremendously influential reign would have been an illegal usurpation.|$|R

Cover crops were maintained on the field after the harvest of the cereal until the sowing of the subsequent maize crop. The performance of the three crops of the succession was monitored as well as weed development and nitrogen dynamic in the soil-plant system. On the one hand, our results showed that black medic and red clover, that supported the best the competition of wheat, were likely to decrease its grain protein content at harvest (- 0. 3 to - 0. 4 %). On the other hand, the four species did not decrease intercropped wheat grain yield. They were able to control weed infestation during the intercropping period and between the two cash crops. Finally, nitrogen restitution to the subsequent maize crop was efficient and allowed a significant 30 % increase of maize grain yield...|$|R

However, this type of firm is exposed to not only the threats that challenge all types of firms but they must also face dangers related to their family nature. Several American and European studies were <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the <b>succession</b> issues associated with family businesses. However, this topic received very little theoretical and empirical investigation in developing countries. In Tunisia, the push in favor of private firms was given in the 60 s. Nearly 50 years later, those entrepreneurs who had received state aid to start their businesses are about to retire. How is this dealt with? How is succession "guaranteed"? Hard as it may be to speculate on the outcome of this succession, can we at least describe its phases first and then consider the factors that could have an impact on it? These central questions to Tunisia's economy have yet to be answered academically.

Since the last ice age, a series of {{submarine}} vol-canic eruptions has created a row of islands south of the main island: the Vestmann Islands (Vest-mannaeyjar) (Fridriksson 1994). In November 1963, an eruption formed Surtsey, the youngest naturally formed island in the world (Fig. 1). Vol-canic activity on Surtsey continued until 1967. The island is located at 63. 4 º N, 20. 3 º W. It has an area of 2. 8 km 2, is located 33 km south of the main island of Iceland and is 20 km south-west of Heimaey, the largest of the Vestmann Islands. During the last 30 years, Surtsey has served as a unique “laboratory ” for scientists <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> primary <b>succession</b> (Fridriksson 1989). Plant cover has been established on part of the island. However, the substrate on Surtsey is poor in avail-able nutrients and organic matter, and has an extremely low water-retention capacity. In 1985 gulls, primarily Larus fuscus and L. argentatus, started nesting on the lava fields. This resulted in a dramatic increase in the nitrogen level, and several more N-demanding vascular plants estab-lished themselves in these areas (Fridriksson 1992). The organic input from birds and plants has resulted in increasing populations of bacteria and fungi, which may serve as food for members of the microfauna, mainly protozoa and nema-todes.
