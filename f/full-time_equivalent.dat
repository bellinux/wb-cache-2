5|$|Although the {{accident}} rate per 100 million miles for professional truckers is low, {{the high number}} of miles driven by a truck driver makes truck driving a risky occupation. Trucking transportation occupations accounted for one quarter of all work-related fatalities in 2015, more than any other U.S. job, according to the U.S. Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics' annual workplace fatality report. The fatal injury rate in 2015 was 14.7 per 100,000 <b>full-time</b> <b>equivalent</b> workers in transportation and material moving occupations (which includes both truckers and air transportation workers.) This was a significantly lower rate than for workers in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations, but high compared to most other occupation categories. The report did not break out the fatal injury rate per 100,000 <b>full-time</b> <b>equivalent</b> workers among aircraft pilots and flight engineers but did note that they had a high fatal injury rate compared to all workers. There were 57 fatalities among aircraft pilots and flight engineers in 2015.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} the time veterinary graduates spend {{in private practice}} and in veterinary work generally, and to determine what factors influence this. METHODS: Questionnaires were completed in the sixth year after graduation by 119 veterinarians {{who had participated in}} this longitudinal study since starting the veterinary course, and the data were analysed using the SAS System for Windows. RESULTS: Of those who started the veterinary course, 90 % graduated and 96 % of these then entered private practice. Five years later 94 % (73 % in <b>full-time</b> <b>equivalents)</b> were working as veterinarians, and 64 % (50 % in <b>full-time</b> <b>equivalents)</b> were still in private practice in Australia. Hours, attitudes of principals and clients, and inadequate rewards were the main reasons for leaving private practice. The likelihood of being still in private practice was greater for those who had had significant responsibility for animals before they entered the course, but it was not related to geographical origin (city vs country), age at entry or gender. Women were, however, {{more likely than men to}} be working part time as veterinarians. Predictions of veterinary working life were not affected by geographical origin or by previous experience with animals or on farms, but men expected to work longer than women. CONCLUSION: The average veterinary career, estimated by veterinarians who graduated 5 years earlier, is 24 years in <b>full-time</b> <b>equivalents</b> for men, and 16 years for women. Almost all (94 %, representing 73 % in <b>full-time</b> <b>equivalents)</b> still work as veterinarians after 5 years, most of them (76 %, representing 59 % in <b>full-time</b> <b>equivalents)</b> in private practice. The likelihood of remaining in private practice is related to previous responsibility for animals...|$|R
