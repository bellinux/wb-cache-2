The column was then washed with loading buffer containing 10 [*]mM imidazole and the protein of interest was eluted with 300 [*]mM imidazole. The eluted IMAC fraction (25 [*]ml) was further loading onto a HiPrep 26 / 10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 10 [*]mM Tris pH[*] 8.0 renaturation buffer and following the manufacturer’s instructions. In this chromatographic step the protein was refolded because the urea and imidazole were totally removed. The peak fractions containing LALF 32 - 51 -E 7 protein were pooled after desalting and then endotoxin removal was performed using an EndoClean™ Kit from BioVintage. The final protein preparation contained < 0.05 endotoxin units (EU)/μg as measured by the chromogenic Limulus ameobocyte lysate assay (Associates of Cape Cod, Inc). Samples in each step of the process were collected and later analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. The MW of the recombinant protein was estimated using size exclusion analytic HPLC (YL 9100) in a Superdex 200 10 / 300 GL column (GE Healthcare); briefly 200 μL of the purified protein were applied at a flow rate of 0.5 [*]ml/min in 10 [*]mM Tris (pH[*] 8.0).

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that globally we have achieved Millennium Development Goal (MDG) Target 7 C, to halve the proportion of the population without access to safe drinking water; however, there is a major flaw with this statement. While Target 7 C calls for access to `safe 2 ̆ 7 drinking water, what is actually being measured and reported is access to an `improved 2 ̆ 7 water source. The World Health Organization (WHO) maintains that they must use this proxy measure because the methods for water quality testing are too expensive and logistically complicated, but by doing so, they may be over reporting safe water coverage. This was shown to be true in Tamatave, Madagascar, where thermotolerant coliforms were detected in water from a type of `improved 2 ̆ 7 source, the Pitcher Pump system. This research looked at several parameters - Pitcher Pump system depth, sampling neighborhood, requirement of pump priming, frequency that the system was repaired, distance from on-site sanitation, and number of users - to see if they were influencing water quality. Of all the parameters tested, only priming was found to be significantly associated with the levels of thermotolerant coliforms detected (Fisher exact test p = 0. 03). Using a Mann-Whitney U test, it was shown that the median thermotolerant coliform concentration was significantly higher in primed wells (41. 3 cfu/ 100 ml) than unprimed wells (3. 5) (p = 0. 01 cfu/ 100 ml). A pilot study was conducted to look at only the effect of depth and to determine if a depth could be identified that could provide safe drinking water. The result of the pilot study showed that, while thermotolerant coliform concentration did decrease with increasing depth, even at the deepest well of 9. 4 m, levels were still above 100 cfu/ 100 ml. Additional research was conducted to investigate the performance and cost of three test kits for both total coliform and Escherichia coli quantification for water quality analysis in developing countries. IDEXX Colilert Quanti-trays[reg] (Colilert), Micrology Laboratories Coliscan[reg] Membrane Filtration tests (Coliscan MF) and a modified method for 3 -M PetrifilmTM Coliform/E. coli plates (modified 3 -M) were compared with standard membrane <b>filtration</b> (<b>standard</b> MF) methods under a range of incubation temperature conditions (22. 0, 35. 0 and 44. 5 [deg]C).

At non-standard temperatures, Coliscan MF proved to be the most accurate when compared to standard methods, with a significant difference with only total coliforms at 44. 5 [deg]C. Modified 3 -M had the poorest correlation with standard MF over the range of temperatures tested, with significant differences noted for all the temperatures except for E. coli at 44. 5 [deg]C. Inexperienced university volunteers found Colilert easiest to use, but Coliscan MF produced E. coli results that were most similar to the experts. Coliscan MF was found to have the overall best performance and lowest cost in this study; however, it did produce high numbers of false positive results...|$|E

Choosing non-denaturing conditions, we developed a several purification schemes {{in order to obtain}} αSyn from human erythrocytes, enabling researchers to employ biophysical techniques in order to elucidate its native structure and properties. ### Introduction Here we introduce a novel way of purifying human α-Synuclein from human erythrocytes, leaving the physiological conformation of the protein intact. This methology has been also successfully applied to human neuroblastoma cells stably overexpressing wt human α-Synuclein as well as to COS- 7 cells transiently overexpressing wt and mutant forms of α-Synuclein. The overall purification is divided in three general steps: An ammonium sulfate preciptation giving a crude protein solution, a bulk purification which can be adjusted to the exact sample properties (volume, cell type, cross contamination) utilizing alternatively 3 different methods (AX, HIC, covalent chromatography), and a polishing step giving pure protein after size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1). **Figure 1 : Flow diagram of the purification scheme** ![Fig 1]([URL] "Fig 1 ") ### Reagents **General reagents/disposables**: 1.

Instead of freshly drawn blood, older samples can be employed. The ratio of α-Synuclein/Hemoglobin in those samples can be drastically reduced however, making the purification more challenging * 3 D 5 cells:* A. It has to be made sure that the cell lysate does not heat up too much during sonication. Short sonication steps with incubation of the sample on ice in between are therefore recommended. B. In cell culture cell lysates, a 25 % (NH 4) 2 SO 4 pre-precipitation step can be beneficial to remove unwanted protein. If HIC is employed for the bulk purification, this is not necessary since the respective binding buffer already contains approx. 25 % (NH 4) 2 SO 4 and thereby eliminates contamination before the column is loaded **Ammonium sulfate precipitation**: In erythrocyte lysate, washing the 50 % (NH 4) 2 SO 4 pellet in 55 % (NH 4) 2 SO 4 solution is highly recommended. Since Hemoglobin stays soluble until 60 - 65 % (NH 4) 2 SO 4, the washing steps provide a cheap and easy method to eliminate large amounts of contaminating Hemoglobin. **Bulk purification** The exact method of bulk purification has to be decided {{by the nature of the}} sample. In general, the HIC gave the highest purity but lowest yield. If high trough-put is needed, the Sepharose 6 B method should be applied. If large amounts of Hemoglobin are present, AX is recommended. If a particular sample has low purity with one of the chosen methods, an additional step utilizing one of the other methods can be employed. A: HIC advantages: Fast, cheap, best purity, (NH 4) 2 SO 4 in binding/elution buffer stabilizes folding. Disadvantages: Low binding capacity, struggles with high amounts of contaminating Hemoglobin. Results can be inconsistent depending on the exact sample. Has sometimes to be applied twice to effectively purifiy all α-Synuclein out of solution. B: AX advantages: Fast, cheap, good binding affinity, Hemoglobin does not bind (making it very effective in separating α-Synuclein and Hemoglobin). Disadvantages: High amounts of NaCl in elution buffer can destabilize α-Synuclein, causing it to precipitate. Transthyretin and α-Synuclein elute very close to each other making thorough removal of blood plasma prior to erythrocyte lysing necessary. Has sometimes to be applied twice to effectively purifiy all α-Synuclein out of solution. C: Instead of Sepharose 6 B gel medium, Sepharose 4 B can be used. Sepharose 6 B has shown to have a better binding capacity, while Sepharose 4 B packed columns can be easier reactivated. Sepharose 6 B advantages: Simple and consistent, good for large sample volumes, high yield, removes both Transthyretin and Hemoglobin from erythrocyte lysate samples very effectively. Since no high pressures/high flow rates, no buffer gradient and no monitoring of UV-absorption or conductivity are needed, it can be done with a simple peristaltic pump. Disadvantages: Expensive gel media, no pre-packed columns commercially available, regeneration of column time consuming. **Size Exclusion Chromatography (Superdex 200) **: Instead of a Superdex 200 column, Superdex 75, Superose 12 and Sephacryl 200 -HR were also successfully employed. The advantage of the Superdex 200 gel medium is the ability to separate Hemoglobin from α-Synuclein in contrast to the above mentioned media. ### Anticipated Results **Yield** From 40 ml of freshly drawn packed red blood cells, up to 0. 5 mg α-Synuclein can be recovered. ** 2 SO 4 precipitation** As seen in Fig. 2, α-Synuclein usually precipitates between 30 and 45 % (NH 4) 2 SO 4. Human Hemoglobin should stay soluble until 60 %. **Figure 2 : Ammonium sulfate precipitation of α-Synuclein from cell lysate** ![Fig 2]([URL] "Fig 2 ") *SDS-PAGE Western blot (C 20) of α-Synuclein. Cell lysate (erythrocyte) was treated step wise with increasing (NH 4) 2 SO 4 concentrations, the resulting pellet was taken up in PBS and analyzed*. **Chromatography** *HIC (HiTrap Phenyl HP) :* α-Synuclein should elute between a conductivity of 135 - 110 mS/cm (~ approx. 0. 7 M (NH 4) 2 SO 4) (Fig. 3 A). *AX (HiTrap Q HP) :* α-Synuclein should elute between a conductivity of 30 - 35 mS/cm (~ approx. 300 mM NaCl) (Fig. 3 B). *SEC (Superdex 200 10 / 300 GL) :* α-Synuclein should elute around 13. 5 ml (Fig. 3 C). **Figure 3 : Example FPLC chromatograms of α-Synuclein purifications and WB analysis of fractions** ![Fig 3]([URL] "Fig 3 ") - *A: Chromatogram of HIC purification of α-Synuclein from human erythrocytes.

No. 151 - 1901) * *Covalent chromatography (Sepharose 6 B, XK 16 / 100) :* α-Synuclein should be completely found in the clear flow-trough. Hemoglobin should be completely bound to the column and then be eluted with DTT (Fig. 4). **Figure 4 : Separation of Hemoglobin and α-Synuclein via covalent chromatography** ![Fig 4]([URL] "Fig 4 ") - *A: SDS-PAGE Western blot analysis of different aliquots of purification scheme utilizing a Sepharose 6 B column.

In this paper {{we are interested in}} those braided bialgebras that are connected as a coalgebra, and such that, up to multiplication by a certain scalar, their braiding restricted to the primitive part is a Hecke operator. To every braided bialgebra as above we associate a braided Lie algebra. Conversely, for each braided Lie algebra we construct a braided bialgebra, namely its enveloping algebra. Braided symmetric and exterior algebras are examples of enveloping algebras (they correspond to a trivial Lie bracket). We show many of the properties of ordinary enveloping algebras still hold in the braided case: the graded associated (with respect to the <b>standard</b> <b>filtration)</b> is a braided symmetric algebra; the coalgebra counterpart is isomorphic to the coalgebra structure of a braided symmetric algebra; the coradical <b>filtration</b> and the <b>standard</b> <b>filtration</b> are identical. As in the classical case, braided symmetric and exterior algebras are Koszul algebras. The proof of this fact is based on a new characterization of Koszul algebras. These properties are used to prove a Milnor-Moore type theorem for infinitesimally cocommutative connected braided bialgebras (see Theorem 5. 5).

We give a structure theorem: any Hopf algebra with injective antipode is a deformation of the bosonization of the Hopf coradical by its diagram, a connected graded Hopf algebra {{in the category of}} Yetter-Drinfeld modules over the latter. We discuss the steps needed to classify Hopf algebras in suitable classes accordingly. For the class of co-Frobenius Hopf algebras, we prove that a Hopf algebra is co-Frobenius if and only if its Hopf coradical is so and the diagram is finite dimensional. We also prove that the <b>standard</b> <b>filtration</b> of such Hopf algebras is finite. Finally, we show that extensions of co-Frobenius (resp. cosemisimple) Hopf algebras are co-Frobenius (resp. cosemisimple).

40|$|We {{propose a}} simple {{continuous}} time model for modeling the lead-lag effect between two financial assets. A two-dimensional process (X_t,Y_t) reproduces a lead-lag effect if, {{for some time}} shift ϑ∈R, the process (X_t,Y_t+ϑ) is a semi-martingale {{with respect to a}} certain filtration. The value of the time shift ϑ is the lead-lag parameter. Depending on the underlying <b>filtration,</b> the <b>standard</b> no-arbitrage case is obtained for ϑ= 0. We study the problem of estimating the unknown parameter ϑ∈R, given randomly sampled non-synchronous data from (X_t) and (Y_t). By applying a certain contrast optimization based on {{a modified version of the}} Hayashi-Yoshida covariation estimator, we obtain a consistent estimator of the lead-lag parameter, together with an explicit rate of convergence governed by the sparsity of the sampling design.

40|$|We {{establish}} {{a connection between}} two settings of representation stability for the symmetric groups S_n over C. One is the symmetric monoidal category Rep(S_∞) of algebraic representations of the infinite symmetric group S_∞ = _n S_n, related {{to the theory of}} FI-modules. The other is the family of rigid symmetric monoidal Deligne categories Rep(S_t), t ∈C, together with their abelian versions Rep^ab(S_t), constructed by Comes and Ostrik. We show that for any t ∈C the natural functor Rep(S_∞) → Rep^ab(S_t) is an exact symmetric faithful monoidal functor, and compute its action on the simple representations of S_∞. Considering the highest weight structure on Rep^ab(S_t), we show that the image of any object of Rep(S_∞) has a <b>filtration</b> with <b>standard</b> objects in Rep^ab(S_t). As a by-product of the proof, we give answers to the questions posed by P. Deligne concerning the cohomology of some complexes in the Deligne category Rep(S_t), and their specializations at non-negative integers n.

40|$|AbstractWe {{define a}} class of (lean) quasi-hereditary K-algebras A for which the <b>standard</b> <b>filtration</b> of the right regular {{representation}} may be described by a suitable directed quotient algebra A+. For this class, projective resolutions of simple left modules over A− will correspond to the so-called BGG resolutions over A, defined earlier by Bernstein, Gelfand and Gelfand. In the case when K is algebraically closed and A+ is a subalgebra of A, A+ coincides {{with the concept of}} a Borel subalgebra of König. We show that many algebras obtained by previously defined canonical constructions belong to this class and have additional structural properties...|$|R
40|$|<b>Filtration</b> is a <b>standard</b> {{tool for}} {{establishing}} the finite model property of modal logics. We consider logics and classes of frames that admit filtration, and identify some operations on them that preserve this property. In particular, {{the operation of}} adding the inverse or the transitive closure of a relation is shown to be safe in this sense. These results are then used to prove that every regular grammar logic with converse admits filtration. We present filtration constructions for right-linear and left-linear grammar logics. We also give a simple example of a grammar modal logic that is undecidable and hence does not admit filtration...|$|R

As a byproduct, we obtain new Nichols algebras of dimension 8 and new Hopf algebras of dimension 64. Comment: First version: 34 pages, with an Appendix.

40|$|We {{suggest a}} new method of {{describing}} invariant measures on Markov compacta and path spaces of graphs, and thus of describing characters of some groups and traces of AF-algebras. The method relies on properties of filtrations {{associated with the}} graph and, in particular, {{on the notion of}} a <b>standard</b> <b>filtration.</b> The main tool is the so-called internal metric that we introduce on simplices of measures; it is an iterated Kantorovich metric, and the key result is that the relative compactness in this metric guarantees a constructive enumeration of the ergodic invariant measures. Applications include a number of classical theorems on invariant measuresComment: 28 pp. Ref 1...|$|R
40|$|Intuitively, {{the filter}} {{dimension}} of an algebra or a module measures how `close' <b>standard</b> <b>filtrations</b> of the algebra or the module are. In particular, {{for a simple}} algebra it also measures the growth of how `fast' one can prove that the algebra is simple. The filter dimension appears naturally when one wants to generalize the Bernstein's inequality for the Weyl algebras to the class of simple finitely generated algebras. This paper is {{a review of the}} author's results on the filter dimension and its connections with the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension, the Krull dimension, the representation theory of simple finitely generated algebras and the `size' of their maximal commutative subalgebras.
